Finished the day with a walk along the Liffey, stopped for a hot chocolate at a random caf√© in Temple Bar, and watched tourists take endless photos of Ha‚Äôpenny Bridge.

Ill tell you how I wish was more gentle .Gentle with my words and tone The way Id speak my mind in such a way that it both offends and inspires you You'll let me know that you wish you could escape the shadow of your past The truth warper.

You're giving me room to become who I am destined to be. This moment is pivotal. If there is an best you and a worst you, wouldn't you want to strive for the best? I guess it depends on those who behold. I was given a give of the spirit. Even without eyes I See You. I bare witness to every micro expression leaking out.

Freshman year, I met a really nice guy. We‚Äôll call him J. We became friends and saw each other a lot because we have similar majors. Third week of classes is a cappella auditions. I meet this girl, T, who is super awesome. She and I find out we have tons of classes and become really close really fast. She joins J‚Äôs a cappella group. Almost immediately, they get together. She falls in love with him. However, because she wasn‚Äôt sure if she could handle long distance for 6 months because he was going abroad for fall quarter of the next year, she breaks up with him (despite me telling her not to). J is distraught. A week later, she regrets it (I didn‚Äôt say I told you so, but I was thinking it). However, he doesn‚Äôt take her back. T forbids me from being friends with J (he was actually going to visit me over the summer because he happened to have an internship where I live, and I had to turn him down).

Over the summer and during his quarter abroad they have phone sex even though they‚Äôre not together. He comes back and they start hooking up again. She then tells me that he‚Äôs been saying that I‚Äôm hot since freshman year. She asks me if I feel anything for him and obviously I say no. They hurt each other over this time, and they finally go no contact. 

Fast forward, it‚Äôs currently junior year. T is studying abroad. So J and I are able to be friends again, which is still a little odd because I can‚Äôt tell her. But also, it‚Äôs not her place to tell me who I can and can‚Äôt be friends with. But here‚Äôs where it gets problematic. We are getting really close. Every day we see each other I find out something new about him that matches me. We make each other laugh, we love the same music, we have the same dating values, even the same religious values. Hell, he even wants to be a Rabbi. The closer we get the more I realize how incredibly compatible we are. 

One event changes things. We both go to a mutual friend‚Äôs party. We were talking and some really drunk guy comes up to us and asks if we‚Äôre a thing. I say no, and J acts really weird about it. He then stays until I leave. Then he texts me if I got home okay. Then he asks me out for coffee. Fuck. I turn it into a business thing and say like oh I‚Äôd love to talk about an a cappella collab sure.

It‚Äôs so obviously a date. We‚Äôre just chatting and having a good time together. In order to lightly turn him down, I say that I‚Äôm talking to someone. His face drops. He leaves 15 minutes later. And for some reason, my heart sank.

A week goes by, and I did some soul searching. I think I‚Äôve actually been in love with him since the beginning. One of those slow, friendship to lovers kind of love. Except, if I were to make it a thing, my best friend, T, would never speak to me again. I realized that we are basically made for each other. My heart hurts so much and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like if I choose my friendship with T I prevent the world from falling apart and keep my integrity, but then I feel like I‚Äôm betraying myself. I hate how my life has come to this. And because I basically turned him down, I have to figure out whether or not I tell him the truth before it‚Äôs too late and he moves on. I‚Äôve been in denial for two years and I just can‚Äôt hide it anymore. I hate lying to myself and to everyone around me. I‚Äôve been asked how I feel about J, and I always lie and say I don‚Äôt like him that way. But deep down, I always have. 

Anyone have any suggestions for my fucked up love life? I feel like the villain in my best friend‚Äôs life but at the same time I feel like I won‚Äôt get the chance to be with someone who was so clearly made for me ever again.",1,1761544787.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I have these 4 days a week with my Mokka pot making up the other 3 days.

Out of a 250g bag of beans with my Mokka pot I get maybe 8-10 drinks in a 4 cup Mokka. 

I was going to pull the trigger on \[De'Longhi Magnifica S, Automatic Bean to Cup Coffee Machine, Espresso and Cappuccino Maker, ECAM22.110.B, Black\] when it went on sale but I don't like rush purchasing so want to know more about this.

All I ever read is ""buy good coffee"". What's good? 

See, I buy from my local independent roasters. It tastes amazing but it's ¬£10 a bag & to me that's not cheap. I save this for weekends. My midweek Mokka is just supermarket beans. Taylors, Costa, Starbucks, Sainsbury's, whichever is at a reasonable price at the time.

What sort of taste difference should I expect with the bean to cup vs the Mokka?

Will I get more drinks out of a 250g bag of beans vs what I just said about the Mokka?

Any specific coffee that's better in a bean to cup vs any other?

How involved are bean to cups? With the Mokka I just grind, stick in the basket, make the coffee, dump the grounds, rinse & dry.

No fatigue or decrease ability to excercise.  I have always had lower BP 110/40s and my resting heart rate has always been low also, 40-45 BPM (sinus bradicardia diagnosed). I am obese. Working on loosing weight. Any way. I got a 2 D echo, as a last resort exam (had halter, ekg, vbc, vits, thyroid,  a1c, all normal). The giddiness only started after weightloss actually (had weight loss surgery). I thought it was a nutritional imbalance and after keeping a diary of when I felt giddy I realized it is only after coffe and activity (working around  the farm). If I dont drink coffee, I dont get it. The 2 D ECHO showed a moderately enlarged left atrium. But I dont have a history of HTN, Diabetes or anything else other than obesity. Noteworthy,  my mom and her dad (now dead at 104 yo) also have bradicardia. See my exam results below. What do you think it could be? Is it hear failure? Seeing carisologust in a few weeks (no appointments before). PcP ordered the exams and told me to take any small meals as it may be hypoglycemia but asked me to see a cardiologist given the results of the echo. ",1,1761544632.0,askCardiology,1,1.0,False

1oh5t31,https://i.redd.it/scz5j9zt4lxf1.jpeg,Delhi to Nainital Trip with 24Cabs Taxi Service: A Journey to the Lake Paradise,"There‚Äôs something special about leaving the hustle of Delhi for the cool, misty hills of [Nainital.](https://24cabs.com/trip/delhi-to-nainital-cabs) When you plan a getaway to this charming hill station, you can picture the sparkling lake, fresh pine air, and calm mountain vibes. Traveling with 24Cabs Taxi Service makes that picture a comfortable, relaxing, and memorable journey from start to finish.

**The Start of a Refreshing Getaway**

Your Delhi to Nainital trip begins early in the morning when your 24Cabs car arrives at your doorstep. It‚Äôs clean, comfortable, and ready for the road ahead. Our friendly driver greets you with a smile, helps with your luggage, and soon, you‚Äôre cruising along the highway, leaving the city behind.

The distance from Delhi to Nainital is about 300 kilometers, and the drive usually takes 7 to 8 hours, depending on the route and traffic. But with 24Cabs, time passes quickly. You can relax, enjoy your favorite music, or simply gaze out the window as the scenery changes from city lights to lush green fields.

**Scenic Route and Stopovers**

The route from Delhi to Nainital is filled with scenic spots and quaint towns. As you pass through Hapur, Moradabad, Rampur, and Haldwani, you‚Äôll feel the air grow cooler and fresher with every kilometer.

Many travelers love to stop for breakfast or tea along the way. Your 24Cabs driver can suggest great roadside dhabas or cafes‚Äîperhaps hot parathas with butter and a cup of steaming chai at Gajraula or a quick snack near Kathgodam. Little moments like these make road trips memorable.

**Arriving in Nainital: A Hill Station from a Dream**

When you finally reach Nainital, the view makes you forget the journey. The fresh mountain air, the sight of the shining Naini Lake, and the cozy cottages on the hills welcome you warmly. It‚Äôs no wonder Nainital is called the ‚ÄúLake District of India.‚Äù

Whether you‚Äôre visiting with family, friends, or that special someone, Nainital has something for everyone.

**Best Places to Visit in Nainital**

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to what you can explore once your 24Cabs ride drops you off in Nainital:

1. Naini Lake  

The heart of Nainital! Enjoy a peaceful boat ride surrounded by stunning hills and reflections of colorful houses on the water.

2. Naina Devi Temple  

Situated right by the lake, this ancient temple adds a spiritual touch to your visit.

3. Snow View Point  

Take a cable car ride or drive up for breathtaking views of the snow-capped Himalayan peaks.

4. Tiffin Top (Dorothy‚Äôs Seat)  

A must-visit spot for nature lovers and photographers. The view of Nainital from here is absolutely incredible.

5. The Mall Road  

Evening walks along Mall Road are delightful, with little shops, cafes, and the cool breeze from the lake.

6. Eco Cave Gardens  

Great for families, especially kids who enjoy exploring small caves and tunnels in a natural setting.

**Local Food to Try**

No trip is complete without tasting local food. In Nainital, you can enjoy everything from hot momos and thukpa to Bhatt ki Churkani, a Kumaoni specialty. Don‚Äôt miss the cafes with lake views‚Äîthey‚Äôre perfect for a coffee break after a long walk.

1oh5syr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bolehland/comments/1oh5syr/coffee_meetups/,Coffee Meetups,"Alright I'm sure this is going to get a nice amount of troll's or possibly deleted as I guess this is somewhat of self-promotion

But I'm always open to meeting new people and all the networking events kinda suck. 'Hey what do you do - oh great here's my business card if you need a plumber'. 

I work from home and kinda love the different cafes around Klang Valley so I'm hopping around to different ones daily.

If you WFH / Study / have the mornings free - feel free to join. The idea is kinda simple - just a casual meetup limited to 6 people so everyone gets a chance to talk - no selling, no dating, etc etc - just to get out of the introvert bubble and meet someone new. Make a friend. Worst case, go check out a cafe you haven't been to before.

Here are this weeks Meetups!

Chapter¬†1¬†

I¬†ignored¬†it.¬†A¬†spark¬†of¬†an¬†idea¬†hit¬†me,¬†and¬†I¬†walked¬†straight¬†to¬†the¬†garage.¬†

The¬†moment¬†I¬†pulled¬†the¬†car¬†out¬†of¬†the¬†main¬†gate,¬†my¬†phone¬†erupted¬†with¬†a¬†frantic¬†call¬†from¬†Ethan.¬†

‚ÄúLiv?¬†Where¬†are¬†you¬†going?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnswer¬†me.¬†Don‚Äôt¬†you¬†forget,¬†you¬†have¬†no¬†one¬†in¬†this¬†world¬†but¬†me.¬†Don‚Äôt¬†even¬†think¬†about¬†taking¬†a¬†single¬†step¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†sight.‚Äù¬†

As¬†the story‚Äôs¬†obsessive,¬†controlling¬†male¬†lead,¬†Ethan¬†had¬†implanted¬†multiple¬†trackers¬†under¬†my¬†skin.¬†The¬†

second¬†I¬†stepped¬†off¬†the¬†property,¬†alarms¬†blared¬†on his¬†phone.¬†

See¬†how¬†inhumane¬†this setup¬†is?¬†The¬†male¬†lead gets to¬†have¬†his¬†body and¬†soul¬†exist¬†in¬†separate¬†zip¬†cod-¬†es,¬†while¬†the¬†female¬†lead¬†is¬†supposed¬†to¬†sit¬†in¬†a¬†gilded¬†cage¬†and count¬†her¬†fingers.¬†

That‚Äôs¬†why¬†the¬†moment¬†his¬†affection score¬†hit¬†100,¬†I¬†made¬†a¬†demand¬†to¬†the¬†System.¬†

‚ÄúI¬†want¬†to¬†be¬†Ethan‚Äôs equal.‚Äù¬†

My¬†intention was¬†to¬†get half¬†of¬†his¬†assets.¬†

But¬†this romance‚Äìobsessed¬†System,¬†with¬†its¬†corporate‚Äìlevel¬†reading¬†comprehension,¬†assumed¬†I¬†was¬†just¬†jealous.¬†It¬†took¬†the¬†initiative¬†and¬†gave¬†me¬†this¬†‚Äúperk‚Äù¬†to track¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†distance¬†from¬†other¬†people.¬†

And¬†now,¬†I¬†finally¬†understood¬†how¬†to¬†use¬†this¬†supposedly¬†useless¬†ability.¬†

I¬†suppressed¬†a¬†laugh,¬†seeing¬†his¬†distance¬†from¬†Isabelle¬†still¬†locked¬†at¬†\[-7¬†inches\].¬†

‚ÄúBut,¬†baby,‚Äù¬†I¬†cooed¬†into¬†the¬†phone,¬†‚Äúyou‚Äôre¬†with¬†Isabelle¬†right¬†now,¬†aren‚Äôt¬†you?‚Äù¬†

1¬†

Silence¬†for¬†a¬†few¬†seconds.¬†Then,¬†a¬†disbelieving,¬†sharp¬†laugh.¬†

‚ÄúLiv,¬†how¬†can¬†you¬†even¬†think¬†that?¬†You¬†know¬†how much¬†I¬†despise¬†that¬†woman.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHmph!‚Äù¬†

A¬†faint,¬†feminine pout¬†echoed¬†through¬†the¬†receiver.¬†It¬†was¬†almost¬†imperceptible.¬†

Then¬†came¬†the dull¬†thud¬†of¬†a¬†body¬†hitting¬†the¬†floor.¬†The¬†distance¬†tracker¬†updated:¬†\[3¬†feet\].¬†

He¬†must¬†have¬†kicked¬†her¬†off¬†the¬†bed.¬†

I¬†forced¬†a¬†sob¬†into¬†my¬†voice.¬†‚ÄúShe¬†really¬†is¬†with¬†you?‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs tone¬†finally¬†tipped¬†into¬†panic.¬†His words¬†came¬†out¬†in¬†a¬†rush.¬†‚ÄúNo,¬†Liv,¬†don‚Äôt¬†overthink¬†this.¬†I‚Äôm¬†comi-¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

The¬†moment¬†he¬†hung¬†up,¬†a transfer¬†notification¬†for¬†$10¬†million¬†hit¬†my¬†burner¬†phone‚Äôs¬†account.¬†

\[I¬†don‚Äôt¬†know¬†who¬†you¬†are,¬†but¬†take¬†the¬†money¬†and¬†stay¬†away¬†from¬†her.\]¬†

I¬†rolled¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Whenever¬†I‚Äôd¬†tentatively¬†asked¬†him¬†for¬†money¬†in¬†the¬†past,¬†his¬†eyes¬†would¬†turn¬†bloodshot,¬†as¬†if¬†I‚Äôd¬†triggered¬†some¬†primal¬†defense¬†mechanism.¬†

‚ÄúYour¬†food,¬†your¬†clothes,¬†your¬†entire¬†life¬†is¬†provided¬†by¬†me.¬†What¬†do¬†*you*¬†need¬†so much¬†money¬†for?¬†Are¬†you¬†planning¬†to¬†leave¬†me?‚Äù¬†he‚Äôd¬†hiss.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†even think about¬†it,¬†Olivia.‚Äù¬†

So¬†flexible,¬†that¬†morality¬†of his.¬†Unwilling¬†to¬†spare¬†a¬†dime¬†for¬†me,¬†but¬†happy¬†to¬†drop¬†millions¬†to¬†cover¬†up¬†an¬†

affair.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†100%¬†affection¬†score¬†was¬†no¬†joke.¬†He¬†drove¬†like¬†a¬†maniac.¬†I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†even¬†made¬†it¬†ten¬†miles before¬†his¬†car¬†cut¬†me¬†off.¬†He wrenched¬†me¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†driver‚Äôs¬†seat and¬†crushed¬†me¬†in¬†a fierce¬†hug.¬†

‚ÄúLiv,¬†you‚Äôre¬†not¬†going¬†anywhere‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

After¬†he‚Äôd¬†half‚Äìdragged,¬†half‚Äìcarried¬†me¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†villa,¬†I¬†focused¬†my¬†senses again.¬†The¬†distance¬†betw-¬†

een¬†him¬†and¬†Isabelle¬†was¬†\[15¬†feet\].¬†

He¬†actually¬†brought her¬†back¬†with¬†him.¬†Did he stuff¬†her¬†in¬†the¬†trunk?¬†

As¬†I¬†was¬†pondering this,¬†a¬†cup¬†of¬†tea¬†was¬†placed¬†in¬†front¬†of¬†me.¬†

‚ÄúHere,¬†Liv.¬†Drink¬†this.¬†It‚Äôll¬†calm your nerves.‚Äù¬†

A¬†suspicious¬†white¬†powder¬†floated¬†on¬†the¬†surface,¬†a¬†blatant¬†insult¬†to¬†my¬†intelligence.¬†

Was¬†he¬†planning¬†to¬†drug¬†me¬†unconscious¬†and¬†then¬†screw¬†Isabelle¬†right¬†next¬†to¬†me?¬†

What¬†a¬†sick¬†game.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†expression¬†was¬†dark¬†as¬†he¬†gripped my¬†chin,¬†his¬†voice¬†dangerously¬†low.¬†‚ÄúBe¬†a¬†good¬†girl,¬†Liv.¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†

want¬†to¬†force¬†you.¬†We¬†can¬†talk¬†about¬†everything¬†after¬†you¬†wake¬†up.‚Äù¬†

I¬†silently¬†estimated¬†Isabelle‚Äôs¬†hiding¬†spot,¬†then¬†shoved¬†Ethan¬†away¬†with¬†all¬†my¬†might,¬†snatching¬†the¬†teacup¬†and¬†flinging¬†its¬†contents¬†behind¬†the¬†sofa.¬†

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù¬†

A¬†disheveled¬†Isabelle¬†leaped¬†out,¬†clutching¬†her¬†head.¬†

This¬†perk¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†useless¬†at¬†all.¬†It¬†was¬†a¬†god‚Äìtier¬†affair‚Äìbuster¬†and¬†blackmail‚Äìassister.¬†

My¬†face¬†twisted¬†into¬†a¬†terrifying¬†mask,¬†my¬†eyes¬†locked¬†on¬†the¬†two¬†of¬†them.¬†I¬†mimicked¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†own¬†chilling¬†

‚ÄúBaby,‚Äù¬†I¬†whispered,¬†‚Äúisn‚Äôt¬†having¬†me¬†enough¬†for¬†you?‚Äù¬†

0925¬†

Ethan¬†was¬†the¬†classic¬†possessive¬†archetype.¬†Before¬†I¬†won¬†him¬†over,¬†he¬†was¬†an¬†untouchable¬†ice¬†king.¬†Afte-¬†

rward,¬†he¬†became¬†a¬†possessive¬†shadow,¬†a¬†ghost¬†haunting¬†my¬†every¬†move.¬†He¬†forced¬†me¬†to¬†quit¬†my¬†job,¬†

forbade¬†me¬†from¬†seeing¬†anyone‚Äìfirst¬†men,¬†then¬†eventually,¬†anyone¬†at¬†all.¬†He¬†isolated¬†me¬†until¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†

leave¬†his¬†sphere¬†of¬†control.¬†His¬†obsession¬†was¬†so¬†absolute¬†he¬†needed¬†to¬†know¬†the¬†*exact*¬†schedule¬†of¬†my¬†

bathroom¬†breaks.¬†

And¬†Isabelle¬†was¬†the¬†classic¬†villainess.¬†In¬†the¬†early¬†stages,¬†she¬†relentlessly¬†tried¬†to¬†frame¬†me,¬†even¬†kidnap¬†

me,¬†but¬†Ethan¬†always thwarted¬†her and¬†retaliated¬†brutally¬†on¬†my¬†behalf.¬†

I¬†thought¬†that¬†once¬†I‚Äôd¬†secured¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†affection,¬†Isabelle¬†would¬†be¬†written¬†out¬†of the¬†story¬†for¬†good.¬†But¬†I¬†

was¬†wrong.¬†On¬†the¬†surface,¬†he¬†drove¬†her¬†family¬†to¬†bankruptcy,¬†but¬†behind¬†the¬†scenes,¬†he¬†propped¬†up¬†her¬†

new¬†career,¬†funded¬†her¬†design¬†studio,¬†and¬†sent¬†her¬†extravagant¬†gifts¬†on¬†holidays.¬†He acted¬†disgusted¬†by¬†

her in¬†public,¬†yet¬†he¬†was¬†helplessly¬†drawn¬†to¬†her¬†in private,¬†their¬†shared¬†animosity fueling¬†a¬†toxic¬†passion.¬†

He¬†gave¬†the¬†villainess¬†endless¬†freedom¬†and¬†illicit¬†pleasure,¬†while¬†I,¬†the¬†heroine,¬†was¬†locked¬†away¬†in¬†a¬†cage.¬†

This¬†world granted¬†him¬†limitless power¬†and¬†capital.¬†No¬†matter¬†how¬†depraved his¬†actions,¬†he¬†faced¬†no¬†

consequences.¬†What¬†was¬†a¬†little¬†infidelity¬†in¬†the¬†grand¬†scheme¬†of¬†things?¬†

The¬†only¬†variable¬†was¬†me,¬†the¬†female¬†lead.¬†He¬†was¬†terrified¬†of¬†me¬†dying.¬†A¬†paper¬†cut¬†on¬†my¬†finger was¬†

enough¬†to¬†send¬†him¬†into¬†a¬†frenzy.¬†

And¬†that¬†was¬†my only¬†leverage.¬†

If¬†I¬†treated¬†him¬†the¬†way¬†he¬†treated¬†me‚Äìif¬†I¬†became¬†unhinged¬†and¬†suicidal¬†over¬†his¬†every¬†move‚Äìhow¬†would¬†

he¬†react?¬†

Best‚Äìcase¬†scenario,¬†I¬†gain¬†control¬†over¬†him.¬†Worst‚Äìcase¬†scenario,¬†I¬†actually¬†succeed¬†in¬†ending my¬†own¬†life¬†

and¬†get¬†sent¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†own¬†world.¬†

Playing¬†the¬†part¬†of¬†the¬†psycho?¬†It¬†was¬†a¬†win‚Äìwin.¬†

3¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†arm¬†tightened¬†around¬†me,¬†the¬†pressure¬†almost¬†bone‚Äìcrushing.¬†‚ÄúLiv,¬†let¬†me¬†explain.¬†She¬†followed¬†

me here,¬†I-‚Äù¬†

Isabelle,¬†composing¬†herself,¬†ran¬†a¬†contemptuous¬†gaze over¬†me.¬†‚ÄúRelax,¬†Olivia.¬†I¬†have¬†no¬†intention¬†of¬†steal-¬†ing¬†him¬†from¬†you.‚Äù¬†She¬†smirked.¬†‚ÄúThe¬†CEO¬†and¬†I¬†just¬†have¬†a‚Ä¶¬†mutually¬†beneficial¬†arrangement.¬†I¬†have¬†my¬†

own¬†career¬†and¬†my¬†own¬†life.¬†Unlike¬†you,¬†a¬†helpless vine¬†who¬†can‚Äôt¬†survive¬†without¬†a¬†man¬†to¬†cling¬†to.‚Äù¬†

09.25¬†

Chapter¬†1¬†

I¬†turned¬†to¬†Ethan,¬†adopting¬†his¬†signature¬†paranoid,¬†whispery¬†tone.¬†‚ÄúA¬†mutually¬†beneficial arrangement?¬†Is¬†she¬†telling¬†the¬†truth?**‚Äù**¬†

Ethan¬†flinched¬†as¬†if¬†I‚Äôd¬†stepped¬†on¬†his¬†tail.¬†He¬†whirled¬†on¬†Isabelle,¬†his¬†eyes¬†feral.¬†‚ÄúShut¬†your¬†mouth!‚Äù¬†He¬†turned¬†back¬†to¬†me,¬†his¬†voice desperate.¬†‚ÄúLiv,¬†don‚Äôt¬†listen to¬†her¬†lies.¬†My¬†heart¬†belongs¬†only¬†to¬†you!¬†My¬†

body‚Ä¶¬†that‚Äôs¬†secondary‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

A¬†distorted¬†smile,¬†a¬†mirror¬†of¬†the¬†one¬†he¬†wore¬†when¬†he¬†was¬†losing¬†control,¬†stretched¬†across¬†my¬†face.¬†‚ÄúSo,¬†your¬†secondary¬†body‚Ä¶¬†that¬†can¬†be¬†given¬†to¬†anyone¬†you¬†please?‚Äù¬†

I¬†shoved¬†him away¬†with¬†surprising¬†speed,¬†snatched¬†a¬†small,¬†steel¬†letter¬†opener¬†from¬†the¬†coffee¬†table,¬†and¬†

without¬†a¬†moment‚Äôs¬†hesitation,¬†pressed¬†it¬†to¬†my¬†own¬†throat.¬†

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†roar¬†was¬†ragged,¬†torn¬†from¬†his¬†soul.¬†He¬†lunged¬†at¬†me¬†like¬†a¬†madman,¬†his¬†hand clamping¬†around¬†my¬†wrist.¬†The¬†blade‚Äôs¬†tip¬†was a¬†hair‚Äôs¬†breadth¬†from¬†my¬†skin.¬†His¬†face¬†was¬†ashen,¬†his¬†entire¬†body¬†trembling.¬†

‚ÄúLet¬†me¬†die!¬†Don‚Äôt¬†touch¬†me¬†with¬†hands¬†that¬†have¬†touched¬†someone¬†else!‚Äù¬†I¬†screamed,¬†throwing¬†his¬†own¬†

past¬†accusations¬†back¬†at¬†him.¬†

Isabelle¬†stood by,¬†arms¬†crossed,¬†sneering.¬†‚ÄúSeriously?¬†What¬†is¬†this,¬†the¬†dark ages?¬†The¬†whole¬†‚ÄòI‚Äôll¬†kill¬†myse-¬†If‚Äò¬†routine?¬†Ethan,¬†is¬†this¬†really¬†the¬†kind¬†of¬†neurotic¬†drama¬†queen¬†you‚Äôre¬†into?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGET¬†OUT!‚Äù¬†Ethan,¬†finding¬†an¬†outlet¬†for¬†his¬†terror¬†and¬†rage,¬†spun around¬†and¬†slapped¬†Isabelle¬†across¬†the¬†

face¬†so¬†hard¬†she¬†stumbled¬†and¬†fell.¬†‚ÄúGet the¬†hell¬†out¬†of¬†here,¬†and¬†don‚Äôt¬†you¬†ever¬†show¬†your¬†face¬†in¬†front¬†of¬†

me¬†and¬†Liv¬†again!‚Äù¬†

Isabelle¬†cradled¬†her¬†cheek,¬†staring¬†at¬†him¬†in¬†disbelief¬†before¬†scrambling¬†to¬†her feet¬†and¬†fleeing.¬†

4¬†

The¬†villa¬†was¬†suddenly¬†silent,¬†save¬†for¬†the¬†sound of¬†our two ragged¬†breaths.¬†Ethan¬†pried¬†the¬†letter¬†opener¬†

from¬†my¬†hand¬†and¬†pulled¬†me¬†into¬†a¬†tight,¬†trembling¬†embrace,¬†still¬†reeling¬†from¬†the¬†shock.¬†

‚ÄúLiv**,**¬†she¬†was¬†lying.¬†Please,¬†believe¬†me‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

I¬†let¬†out¬†a¬†shuddering¬†breath¬†and¬†whispered¬†in¬†the¬†most¬†devoted,¬†heartfelt¬†tone¬†I¬†could¬†muster,¬†‚ÄúReally?¬†Then from¬†now¬†on,¬†will¬†you¬†share¬†your¬†entire¬†schedule¬†with¬†me?¬†Everything.¬†And¬†don‚Äôt¬†you¬†dare¬†lie.‚Äù¬†I¬†lean-¬†

ed¬†in¬†closer,¬†my¬†voice¬†dropping¬†to¬†a¬†chilling¬†murmur.¬†

‚ÄúIf you¬†betray¬†me,¬†I‚Äôll¬†kill¬†you.¬†Then¬†I‚Äôll¬†kill¬†myself.‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs body¬†went¬†rigid.¬†

He¬†looked¬†down¬†at¬†me, and¬†the¬†first¬†emotion¬†that¬†surfaced¬†in¬†his¬†eyes¬†was¬†not¬†fear,¬†but¬†a¬†twisted,¬†ecstatic¬†

That‚Äôs¬†why¬†the¬†moment¬†his¬†affection score¬†hit¬†100,¬†I¬†made¬†a¬†demand¬†to¬†the¬†System.¬†

‚ÄúI¬†want¬†to¬†be¬†Ethan‚Äôs equal.‚Äù¬†

My¬†intention was¬†to¬†get half¬†of¬†his¬†assets.¬†

But¬†this romance‚Äìobsessed¬†System,¬†with¬†its¬†corporate‚Äìlevel¬†reading¬†comprehension,¬†assumed¬†I¬†was¬†just¬†jealous.¬†It¬†took¬†the¬†initiative¬†and¬†gave¬†me¬†this¬†‚Äúperk‚Äù¬†to track¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†distance¬†from¬†other¬†people.¬†

And¬†now,¬†I¬†finally¬†understood¬†how¬†to¬†use¬†this¬†supposedly¬†useless¬†ability.¬†

I¬†suppressed¬†a¬†laugh,¬†seeing¬†his¬†distance¬†from¬†Isabelle¬†still¬†locked¬†at¬†\[-7¬†inches\].¬†

‚ÄúBut,¬†baby,‚Äù¬†I¬†cooed¬†into¬†the¬†phone,¬†‚Äúyou‚Äôre¬†with¬†Isabelle¬†right¬†now,¬†aren‚Äôt¬†you?‚Äù¬†

Silence¬†for¬†a¬†few¬†seconds.¬†Then,¬†a¬†disbelieving,¬†sharp¬†laugh.¬†

‚ÄúLiv,¬†how¬†can¬†you¬†even¬†think¬†that?¬†You¬†know¬†how much¬†I¬†despise¬†that¬†woman.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHmph!‚Äù¬†

A¬†faint,¬†feminine pout¬†echoed¬†through¬†the¬†receiver.¬†It¬†was¬†almost¬†imperceptible.¬†

Then¬†came¬†the dull¬†thud¬†of¬†a¬†body¬†hitting¬†the¬†floor.¬†The¬†distance¬†tracker¬†updated:¬†\[3¬†feet\].¬†

He¬†must¬†have¬†kicked¬†her¬†off¬†the¬†bed.¬†

I¬†forced¬†a¬†sob¬†into¬†my¬†voice.¬†‚ÄúShe¬†really¬†is¬†with¬†you?‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs tone¬†finally¬†tipped¬†into¬†panic.¬†His words¬†came¬†out¬†in¬†a¬†rush.¬†‚ÄúNo,¬†Liv,¬†don‚Äôt¬†overthink¬†this.¬†I‚Äôm¬†comi-¬†

\[I¬†don‚Äôt¬†know¬†who¬†you¬†are,¬†but¬†take¬†the¬†money¬†and¬†stay¬†away¬†from¬†her.\]¬†

I¬†rolled¬†my¬†eyes.¬†

Whenever¬†I‚Äôd¬†tentatively¬†asked¬†him¬†for¬†money¬†in¬†the¬†past,¬†his¬†eyes¬†would¬†turn¬†bloodshot,¬†as¬†if¬†I‚Äôd¬†triggered¬†some¬†primal¬†defense¬†mechanism.¬†

‚ÄúYour¬†food,¬†your¬†clothes,¬†your¬†entire¬†life¬†is¬†provided¬†by¬†me.¬†What¬†do¬†*you*¬†need¬†so much¬†money¬†for?¬†Are¬†you¬†planning¬†to¬†leave¬†me?‚Äù¬†he‚Äôd¬†hiss.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt¬†even think about¬†it,¬†Olivia.‚Äù¬†

affair.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†100%¬†affection¬†score¬†was¬†no¬†joke.¬†He¬†drove¬†like¬†a¬†maniac.¬†I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†even¬†made¬†it¬†ten¬†miles before¬†his¬†car¬†cut¬†me¬†off.¬†He wrenched¬†me¬†out¬†of¬†my¬†driver‚Äôs¬†seat and¬†crushed¬†me¬†in¬†a fierce¬†hug.¬†

‚ÄúLiv,¬†you‚Äôre¬†not¬†going¬†anywhere‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

After¬†he‚Äôd¬†half‚Äìdragged,¬†half‚Äìcarried¬†me¬†back¬†into¬†the¬†villa,¬†I¬†focused¬†my¬†senses again.¬†The¬†distance¬†betw-¬†

een¬†him¬†and¬†Isabelle¬†was¬†\[15¬†feet\].¬†

He¬†actually¬†brought her¬†back¬†with¬†him.¬†Did he stuff¬†her¬†in¬†the¬†trunk?¬†

As¬†I¬†was¬†pondering this,¬†a¬†cup¬†of¬†tea¬†was¬†placed¬†in¬†front¬†of¬†me.¬†

‚ÄúHere,¬†Liv.¬†Drink¬†this.¬†It‚Äôll¬†calm your nerves.‚Äù¬†

A¬†suspicious¬†white¬†powder¬†floated¬†on¬†the¬†surface,¬†a¬†blatant¬†insult¬†to¬†my¬†intelligence.¬†

Was¬†he¬†planning¬†to¬†drug¬†me¬†unconscious¬†and¬†then¬†screw¬†Isabelle¬†right¬†next¬†to¬†me?¬†

What¬†a¬†sick¬†game.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†expression¬†was¬†dark¬†as¬†he¬†gripped my¬†chin,¬†his¬†voice¬†dangerously¬†low.¬†‚ÄúBe¬†a¬†good¬†girl,¬†Liv.¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†

want¬†to¬†force¬†you.¬†We¬†can¬†talk¬†about¬†everything¬†after¬†you¬†wake¬†up.‚Äù¬†

I¬†silently¬†estimated¬†Isabelle‚Äôs¬†hiding¬†spot,¬†then¬†shoved¬†Ethan¬†away¬†with¬†all¬†my¬†might,¬†snatching¬†the¬†teacup¬†and¬†flinging¬†its¬†contents¬†behind¬†the¬†sofa.¬†

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù¬†

A¬†disheveled¬†Isabelle¬†leaped¬†out,¬†clutching¬†her¬†head.¬†

Ethan¬†was¬†the¬†classic¬†possessive¬†archetype.¬†Before¬†I¬†won¬†him¬†over,¬†he¬†was¬†an¬†untouchable¬†ice¬†king.¬†Afte-¬†

rward,¬†he¬†became¬†a¬†possessive¬†shadow,¬†a¬†ghost¬†haunting¬†my¬†every¬†move.¬†He¬†forced¬†me¬†to¬†quit¬†my¬†job,¬†

forbade¬†me¬†from¬†seeing¬†anyone‚Äìfirst¬†men,¬†then¬†eventually,¬†anyone¬†at¬†all.¬†He¬†isolated¬†me¬†until¬†I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†

leave¬†his¬†sphere¬†of¬†control.¬†His¬†obsession¬†was¬†so¬†absolute¬†he¬†needed¬†to¬†know¬†the¬†*exact*¬†schedule¬†of¬†my¬†

bathroom¬†breaks.¬†

And¬†Isabelle¬†was¬†the¬†classic¬†villainess.¬†In¬†the¬†early¬†stages,¬†she¬†relentlessly¬†tried¬†to¬†frame¬†me,¬†even¬†kidnap¬†

me,¬†but¬†Ethan¬†always thwarted¬†her and¬†retaliated¬†brutally¬†on¬†my¬†behalf.¬†

I¬†thought¬†that¬†once¬†I‚Äôd¬†secured¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†affection,¬†Isabelle¬†would¬†be¬†written¬†out¬†of the¬†story¬†for¬†good.¬†But¬†I¬†

was¬†wrong.¬†On¬†the¬†surface,¬†he¬†drove¬†her¬†family¬†to¬†bankruptcy,¬†but¬†behind¬†the¬†scenes,¬†he¬†propped¬†up¬†her¬†

new¬†career,¬†funded¬†her¬†design¬†studio,¬†and¬†sent¬†her¬†extravagant¬†gifts¬†on¬†holidays.¬†He acted¬†disgusted¬†by¬†

her in¬†public,¬†yet¬†he¬†was¬†helplessly¬†drawn¬†to¬†her¬†in private,¬†their¬†shared¬†animosity fueling¬†a¬†toxic¬†passion.¬†

He¬†gave¬†the¬†villainess¬†endless¬†freedom¬†and¬†illicit¬†pleasure,¬†while¬†I,¬†the¬†heroine,¬†was¬†locked¬†away¬†in¬†a¬†cage.¬†

This¬†world granted¬†him¬†limitless power¬†and¬†capital.¬†No¬†matter¬†how¬†depraved his¬†actions,¬†he¬†faced¬†no¬†

consequences.¬†What¬†was¬†a¬†little¬†infidelity¬†in¬†the¬†grand¬†scheme¬†of¬†things?¬†

The¬†only¬†variable¬†was¬†me,¬†the¬†female¬†lead.¬†He¬†was¬†terrified¬†of¬†me¬†dying.¬†A¬†paper¬†cut¬†on¬†my¬†finger was¬†

enough¬†to¬†send¬†him¬†into¬†a¬†frenzy.¬†

And¬†that¬†was¬†my only¬†leverage.¬†

If¬†I¬†treated¬†him¬†the¬†way¬†he¬†treated¬†me‚Äìif¬†I¬†became¬†unhinged¬†and¬†suicidal¬†over¬†his¬†every¬†move‚Äìhow¬†would¬†

he¬†react?¬†

Best‚Äìcase¬†scenario,¬†I¬†gain¬†control¬†over¬†him.¬†Worst‚Äìcase¬†scenario,¬†I¬†actually¬†succeed¬†in¬†ending my¬†own¬†life¬†

and¬†get¬†sent¬†back¬†to¬†my¬†own¬†world.¬†

Playing¬†the¬†part¬†of¬†the¬†psycho?¬†It¬†was¬†a¬†win‚Äìwin.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†arm¬†tightened¬†around¬†me,¬†the¬†pressure¬†almost¬†bone‚Äìcrushing.¬†‚ÄúLiv,¬†let¬†me¬†explain.¬†She¬†followed¬†

me here,¬†I-‚Äù¬†

Isabelle,¬†composing¬†herself,¬†ran¬†a¬†contemptuous¬†gaze over¬†me.¬†‚ÄúRelax,¬†Olivia.¬†I¬†have¬†no¬†intention¬†of¬†steal-¬†ing¬†him¬†from¬†you.‚Äù¬†She¬†smirked.¬†‚ÄúThe¬†CEO¬†and¬†I¬†just¬†have¬†a‚Ä¶¬†mutually¬†beneficial¬†arrangement.¬†I¬†have¬†my¬†

I¬†turned¬†to¬†Ethan,¬†adopting¬†his¬†signature¬†paranoid,¬†whispery¬†tone.¬†‚ÄúA¬†mutually¬†beneficial arrangement?¬†Is¬†she¬†telling¬†the¬†truth?**‚Äù**¬†

Ethan¬†flinched¬†as¬†if¬†I‚Äôd¬†stepped¬†on¬†his¬†tail.¬†He¬†whirled¬†on¬†Isabelle,¬†his¬†eyes¬†feral.¬†‚ÄúShut¬†your¬†mouth!‚Äù¬†He¬†turned¬†back¬†to¬†me,¬†his¬†voice desperate.¬†‚ÄúLiv,¬†don‚Äôt¬†listen to¬†her¬†lies.¬†My¬†heart¬†belongs¬†only¬†to¬†you!¬†My¬†

A¬†distorted¬†smile,¬†a¬†mirror¬†of¬†the¬†one¬†he¬†wore¬†when¬†he¬†was¬†losing¬†control,¬†stretched¬†across¬†my¬†face.¬†‚ÄúSo,¬†your¬†secondary¬†body‚Ä¶¬†that¬†can¬†be¬†given¬†to¬†anyone¬†you¬†please?‚Äù¬†

I¬†shoved¬†him away¬†with¬†surprising¬†speed,¬†snatched¬†a¬†small,¬†steel¬†letter¬†opener¬†from¬†the¬†coffee¬†table,¬†and¬†

without¬†a¬†moment‚Äôs¬†hesitation,¬†pressed¬†it¬†to¬†my¬†own¬†throat.¬†

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs¬†roar¬†was¬†ragged,¬†torn¬†from¬†his¬†soul.¬†He¬†lunged¬†at¬†me¬†like¬†a¬†madman,¬†his¬†hand clamping¬†around¬†my¬†wrist.¬†The¬†blade‚Äôs¬†tip¬†was a¬†hair‚Äôs¬†breadth¬†from¬†my¬†skin.¬†His¬†face¬†was¬†ashen,¬†his¬†entire¬†body¬†trembling.¬†

‚ÄúLet¬†me¬†die!¬†Don‚Äôt¬†touch¬†me¬†with¬†hands¬†that¬†have¬†touched¬†someone¬†else!‚Äù¬†I¬†screamed,¬†throwing¬†his¬†own¬†

past¬†accusations¬†back¬†at¬†him.¬†

Isabelle¬†stood by,¬†arms¬†crossed,¬†sneering.¬†‚ÄúSeriously?¬†What¬†is¬†this,¬†the¬†dark ages?¬†The¬†whole¬†‚ÄòI‚Äôll¬†kill¬†myse-¬†If‚Äò¬†routine?¬†Ethan,¬†is¬†this¬†really¬†the¬†kind¬†of¬†neurotic¬†drama¬†queen¬†you‚Äôre¬†into?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGET¬†OUT!‚Äù¬†Ethan,¬†finding¬†an¬†outlet¬†for¬†his¬†terror¬†and¬†rage,¬†spun around¬†and¬†slapped¬†Isabelle¬†across¬†the¬†

Isabelle¬†cradled¬†her¬†cheek,¬†staring¬†at¬†him¬†in¬†disbelief¬†before¬†scrambling¬†to¬†her feet¬†and¬†fleeing.¬†

The¬†villa¬†was¬†suddenly¬†silent,¬†save¬†for¬†the¬†sound of¬†our two ragged¬†breaths.¬†Ethan¬†pried¬†the¬†letter¬†opener¬†

from¬†my¬†hand¬†and¬†pulled¬†me¬†into¬†a¬†tight,¬†trembling¬†embrace,¬†still¬†reeling¬†from¬†the¬†shock.¬†

‚ÄúLiv**,**¬†she¬†was¬†lying.¬†Please,¬†believe¬†me‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

I¬†let¬†out¬†a¬†shuddering¬†breath¬†and¬†whispered¬†in¬†the¬†most¬†devoted,¬†heartfelt¬†tone¬†I¬†could¬†muster,¬†‚ÄúReally?¬†Then from¬†now¬†on,¬†will¬†you¬†share¬†your¬†entire¬†schedule¬†with¬†me?¬†Everything.¬†And¬†don‚Äôt¬†you¬†dare¬†lie.‚Äù¬†I¬†lean-¬†

‚ÄúIf you¬†betray¬†me,¬†I‚Äôll¬†kill¬†you.¬†Then¬†I‚Äôll¬†kill¬†myself.‚Äù¬†

Ethan‚Äôs body¬†went¬†rigid.¬†

He¬†looked¬†down¬†at¬†me, and¬†the¬†first¬†emotion¬†that¬†surfaced¬†in¬†his¬†eyes¬†was¬†not¬†fear,¬†but¬†a¬†twisted,¬†ecstatic¬†

1oh5rek,https://i.redd.it/78cl5yoh3lxf1.png,"I Came Back Cold, But I'm the One Burning Them Down","When my stepsister Jade and I both got caught in an avalanche, the rescue team finally reached us.

But there was only one stretcher. Only room for one person to make it down.

My father grabbed my hand, his grip tight.

""Vivian, sweetheart, you know Jade's always been delicate. Be a good girl and let her go first. Just wait here‚Äîthe next team will be here soon.""

In my past life, I believed him. I gave Jade my chance to survive.

But then the storm picked back up. The rescue was called off. And I froze to death on that mountain.

Meanwhile, Jade inherited everything I owned.

She and my fianc√©‚Äîwho she'd been sleeping with behind my back all along‚Äîlived happily ever after on my fortune.

My spirit hovered above my own memorial service, and I heard my father tell the guests:

""That girl was always so difficult. At least dying to save Jade gave her life some meaning.""

When I woke up again, I was back at that exact moment‚Äîmy father's hand gripping mine on the frozen slope.

This time, I nodded through my tears and gently helped Jade onto the stretcher myself.

They want a sacrifice? Well. I'll get them one. Just not the one they planned.

...

The storm was picking up fast. Within seconds, the rescue team vanished into a wall of white.

I dragged my ass through the snow, every muscle screaming in protest.

Finally, I found a slope sheltered from the wind and carved out a makeshift snow cave, cramming myself inside and curling into a ball.

Cut off from the howling wind, my body temperature slowly started climbing back up.

I fished the satellite phone out of my inner jacket pocket and powered it on.

The screen lit up, casting an eerie glow on my ghostly white face.

Full bars.

I dialed. He picked up on the first ring.

""Well, look who it is. Finally grace me with a call, your highness? Thought you were off conquering Everest without us peasants cramping your style.""

Zeke. My ride-or-die from back in my extreme sports days.

An absolute maniac who'd choose life over a paycheck any day‚Äîand who didn't give a damn about anyone except me.

""Zeke,"" I said quietly. ""I'm stuck in an avalanche zone.""

Dead silence.

Then‚ÄîCRASH‚Äîa chair hitting the floor, followed by his voice exploding through the speaker.

""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! Viv, where are you?!""

""Chill."" I rattled off my coordinates, my voice flat and cold. ""I'm okay for now. But I need you to pull me out.""

""What about search and rescue?""

""They airlifted Jade out."" I might as well have been reading off a grocery list. ""Dad told me to wait my turn.""

Beat.

Zeke knew exactly what kind of circus my family was.

""Wait your turn? Wait your fucking turn?! Like hell you will!""

He was losing it now.

""I checked the forecast‚Äîthere's a monster blizzard rolling in within twelve hours. They'll ground everything. No flights, no rescues, nothing!

""He's basically signing your death warrant!""

""Yeah,"" I said flatly. ""I know.""

""Sit tight, Viv. I don't care if I have to steal a goddamn helicopter‚ÄîI'm getting you off that mountain.""

Call ended.

I slumped against the icy wall and closed my eyes, rationing what little energy I had left.

Meanwhile, down in civilization? Oh, I knew what was happening.

My devoted father was probably standing in front of a news crew right now, playing the heartbroken dad forced to be brave after ""losing"" his beloved daughter.

And my sweet, fragile stepsister?

Definitely tucked into some luxury hospital suite, soaking up five-star medical treatment while everyone fawned over her with sympathy.

Oh, and my fianc√©?

Yeah. He was probably right there at her bedside, holding her delicate little hand, murmuring that none of this was her fault.

Because that's EXACTLY how it played out last time.

Bored out of my mind, I opened the satellite phone's browser.

The signal crawled, but it was just enough to load a few headlines.

""Heroic sister: Heiress Missing After Avalanche While Saving Stepsister""

""Sisterly Love Moves Nation: Vivian Montgomery Sacrifices Herself to Save Stepsister""

""Devastated Father Vows: 'We Won't Stop Searching'""

I almost laughed.

""Heroic sister."" ""Sisterly love.""

Whoever wrote this garbage deserved an award for creative fiction.

I clicked on one article. The photo made my stomach turn.

There was Dad‚Äîred-rimmed eyes, looking like death warmed over, practically collapsing into his assistant's arms.

Jade was propped up in a hospital bed, pale as a ghost, IV in her arm.

And my darling fianc√©? Perched on the edge of her bed, carefully peeling an apple for her.

What a touching tableau. Father and daughter. Star-crossed lovers.

I saved the photo. Then shut the damn thing off.

Time dragged.

I wrapped myself tighter in the emergency blanket, curling into the smallest ball possible.

Even with the cave blocking the wind, the cold burrowed deep into my bones.

I lost track of how long I'd been sitting there when the satellite phone finally buzzed again.

Zeke.

""Viv, you there? We're in the mountain range now. Can't land the chopper‚Äîwe're hiking up. Just hold on a little longer, okay?""

""Relax. I'm not dying yet."" I licked my cracked lips. ""Do me a favor though.""

""Shoot.""

""Check flight records in and out of Manhattan over the past week. See if there's a passenger named Julian Bradford.""

Julian Bradford. My CHARMING fianc√©.

In my past life, I didn't find out until after I was dead‚Äîhe'd been screwing Jade the entire time.

This whole ""arranged engagement"" thing? Just a scam. The three of them plotting together to swallow up everything my mother left me.

He played the perfect fianc√© to my face. Behind my back? He and Jade were inseparable.

Zeke went quiet for a second. Then I heard furious typing.

""Got it. He flew back from Paris three days ago. First class.""

Three days ago.

The day before the avalanche.

My heart dropped into my stomach.

So that's how it is.

Couldn't even wait, huh?

Chapter 2

""Zeke, one more thing."" My voice was ice-cold.

""Get photos of Julian and Jade together in that hospital room. Then send them to every gossip site in Manhattan. Anonymously.""

I paused.

""Subject line: 'Heiress Still Missing, Fianc√© Already Cozy with Stepsister in Hospital Suite.'""

Zeke let out a low whistle.

""Damn. Remind me never to cross you.""

""Finally playing dirty, huh? About time. Those bastards deserve it.""

""This is just the appetizer,"" I said quietly.

After hanging up, I forced down the last energy bar. I needed to conserve my strength.

The real fight was waiting for me below.

\---

Eventually, darkness swallowed everything. Inside the snow cave, I couldn't see my own hand.

Just when my body started shutting down, I heard it‚Äîboots crunching through snow, voices cutting through the wind.

""Vivian!""

""Miss Montgomery!""

Zeke and his people!

I summoned every ounce of strength left and dragged myself out of the cave.

Through the blizzard, I spotted them‚Äîfigures moving toward me with flashlights cutting through the white.

Zeke was leading the pack.

The second he saw me, he rushed over and pulled me into a tight hug.

""Holy shit, you're actually alive!""

His voice shook.

I patted his shoulder weakly. ""Told you I wouldn't die.""

""Yeah, yeah. Save the tough talk. Let's get the hell out of here before we all turn into popsicles.""

Immediately, one of his guys threw a heavy parka over my shoulders. Another handed me a thermos.

Hot coffee burned down my throat. First real warmth I'd felt in hours.

\---

The climb down was brutal.

Zeke's team strapped me into a harness and kept me sandwiched between them for safety.

Even then, I nearly slipped and fell more times than I could count.

""Vivian, hold ON!"" Zeke yelled over his shoulder.

I gritted my teeth and forced myself to keep moving, one step at a time.

I couldn't die here.

Not before I got to watch my loving father and darling sister go down in flames.

\---

After what felt like an eternity, we finally made it to base camp.

Instead of heading to the main rescue site, Zeke steered me around back where a black SUV sat waiting in the shadows.

""Get in. We'll sort everything out once we're back in the city.""

The heat slammed into me the second I climbed inside. My frozen muscles started to unthaw.

Zeke pulled a first aid kit from the back and started checking me over.

""Could be worse,"" he muttered while wrapping gauze around my fingers. ""Frostbite, exhaustion, some cuts. Nothing life-threatening.""

As he worked, he kept up a steady stream of curses under his breath.

""Richard Montgomery, that son of a bitch‚Äîwhen we get back, I'm gonna have someone break both his legs!""

""Don't."" I caught his wrist. ""Assault lands you in prison. I want him destroyed in ways that hurt way worse than broken bones.""

Zeke went still and stared at me.

""Viv... you're different.""

""Yeah, well."" I leaned back against the seat, exhausted. ""Dying has a way of changing you.""

\---

The SUV tore through the night, mile after mile, until finally the city lights blazed into view.

Zeke brought me straight to a penthouse suite at the Waldorf in Midtown.

""Stay here for now. Whatever you do, don't go home. That place is a viper's nest.""

I didn't argue.

""What about my dad‚Äî""

""Already handled,"" he cut me off. ""Got people watching him round the clock. He breathes wrong, I'll know.""

Then Zeke tossed me a brand new phone.

""Your number's already ported over. Anything comes up, call me immediately.""

\---

I took a long, scalding shower and changed into clean clothes. Finally felt like a human being again.

Standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, I stared out at the glittering Manhattan skyline. Inside, though, I felt nothing but cold emptiness.

After Mom died, I'd completely fallen apart. The depression nearly killed me.

Dad and Jade were the ones who ""saved"" me‚Äîwrapped me up in all that warmth, all that concern, all that picture-perfect family love.

But now I understood the truth. They never wanted to save me.

They just needed me alive long enough to slowly bleed my inheritance dry.

My phone buzzed. A text from Zeke.

\[Photos sent. All the outlets bit. Tomorrow morning's gonna be a circus.\]

I typed back: \[Perfect.\]

Then I scrolled through my contacts and dialed another number.

Uncle Chen. Mom's lawyer. The only person she'd ever truly trusted.

""Uncle Chen. It's me, Vivian.""

A sharp intake of breath on the other end.

""Vivian? But I thought‚Äîweren't you stuck on that mountain‚Äî""

""I made it back,"" I said evenly. ""And I need your help with something. I need a complete inventory of everything Mom left me‚Äîevery stock, every account, every single asset. After that, I need you to draft an emergency freeze on all of it.""

Long silence.

""Vivian... what's going on?""

I stared at my pale reflection in the dark glass.

""Someone just tried to leave me for DEAD on that mountain,"" I said quietly. ""And now they're coming for everything Mom left me.""

Chapter 3

The next morning, my phone went off like a bomb.

Notifications flooded the screen, one after another, until I could barely see straight.

\*\*#MontgomeryHeiressFianc√©CaughtCheating\*\*

\*\*#HighSocietyScandal: Was It Murder?\*\*

\*\*#JadeMontgomeryExposed: Victim or Manipulator?\*\*

The media had plastered yesterday's cozy hospital photo right next to my headline.

The irony was chef's kiss.

And the comments section? Absolute chaos.

\*""Wait, WHAT? Vivian's still missing and these two are already hooking up?""\*

\*""I KNEW Jade looked sketchy. Total fake bitch vibes.""\*

\*""Poor Vivian. She literally sacrificed herself to save a snake.""\*

\*""And the fianc√©'s no better. His girl's not even COLD yet and he's moved on? Disgusting.""\*

Just like that, public opinion flipped overnight.

Jade and Julian‚Äîyesterday's tragic heroes‚Äîwere now getting absolutely torn apart online.

I smiled.

This was only step one.

\---

A few hours later, Montgomery Group scrambled to issue an emergency statement.

In it, my father condemned the ""vicious slander"" from ""unethical media outlets"" and threatened legal action against anyone spreading ""baseless rumors.""

Then he announced a press conference scheduled for 3 p.m. at Montgomery Tower to ""set the record straight once and for all.""

I texted Zeke immediately.

\[3 PM. Montgomery Tower. I need you to set up my grand entrance.\]

His reply came back instantly.

\[Say less. It's gonna be EPIC.\]

\---

By 2:50 p.m., the plaza outside Montgomery Tower was already swarming with reporters.

I sat in the back of Zeke's SUV, sunglasses and mask firmly in place, watching the feeding frenzy unfold through tinted windows.

""Everything's set,"" Zeke said, glancing back at me. ""You'll slip in through the side entrance. My guy will get you backstage without anyone spotting you.""

""Perfect.""

At exactly 3 p.m., the press conference began.

I stood backstage, watching the whole thing unfold on a monitor.

Three people sat at the long table in front of a wall of cameras.

My father, Richard Montgomery, sat front and center‚Äîlooking haggard, grief-stricken, every inch the devastated parent.

Jade and Julian flanked him on either side, both with their heads bowed in perfect synchronized misery.

Dad leaned forward into the microphone, his voice thick with emotion.

""First, I want to thank all of you for coming during this incredibly difficult time.""

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.

""The lies circulating online have caused my family immeasurable pain. My daughter Vivian remains missing‚Äîher fate still unknown‚Äîand yet, instead of support, we've been met with vicious attacks on my other daughter, Jade, and my future son-in-law, Julian.""

Another pause. Perfectly timed.

""Jade and Vivian grew up together. They were inseparable. Vivian risked her LIFE to save Jade on that mountain. And now? Jade blames herself more than anyone. She's barely eaten. Barely slept. She's only holding on by sheer willpower.""

His voice wavered just slightly.

""As for Julian‚Äîhe and Vivian were like family. The MOMENT he heard what happened, he dropped everything and flew back from abroad. He's been at the hospital around the clock, taking care of Jade because that's what Vivian would have wanted. He's been there because Jade needs to survive‚Äîfor Vivian's sake.""

Then came the crescendo.

""What they share is pure, familial love. And yet these VULTURES have twisted it into something filthy and disgusting.""

He looked straight into the camera, eyes blazing with righteous anger.

""I have to ask‚Äîdo any of you even have a CONSCIENCE?""

The performance was flawless.

Several of the female reporters were already tearing up.

Then it was Jade's turn.

She reached for the microphone with trembling hands, her eyes red and puffy.

""I'm so sorry...This is all my fault. If Vivian hadn't tried to save me, she wouldn't have‚Äî""

She couldn't finish. She pressed both hands over her face, shoulders shaking with sobs.

Right on cue, Julian leaned over and gently took her hand in his.

""Jade, don't,"" he murmured softly. ""None of this is your fault.""

Then he lifted his head and looked directly into the cameras, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.

""Jade and I are INNOCENT. And I truly believe‚Äîwherever Vivian is right now‚Äîshe wouldn't want to see us destroyed like this.""

God, the ACTING.

I stood there watching them through the monitor, and my smile grew colder with every passing second.

Alright then.

Show's over.

Time for MY entrance.

I pulled out my phone and sent Zeke the signal.

He‚Äôs risen out his cold bed

In search of a cup to clear his head

His gaze is lost out the fallen leaves

Lost in the waves of the breeze

*I believed humans expressed emotion, must he be a different case?*



He grunts his eyes open

Crawls out his grey metal machine

Propane

The machine is drunk on scene

*Must they all drink to move on?*



He reaches a giant box

Little people with no faces speed past

Weird colourful boxes drink metal circles

And clunk more liquid wrapped in colour

*I doubt its pleasure, I see the burn on his face*



His chest rises nor falls

His feelings answers nor calls

His body stands weary not tall

His life meaningless for all

*Do they all miss where I come from?*



The leaves have lost their tone

His heart grew far from home

His feelings close to none

His smile eerily sown

We haven‚Äôt yet stolen sideways glances or shared wine, but the words we share in silence hold that same deep intimacy, even as we reach across distance. You are everywhere, softening the dark corners under my ribs, a warmth that gently seeps through the coldest hours.

I won‚Äôt lie and say it‚Äôs been easy, because it hasn‚Äôt. Between misunderstandings, wounds, and ache, we have hurt each other, whether intended or not, it happened and I‚Äôm sorry for every moment I made it harder to breathe, for every word that missed its mark or fell heavy in the space between us. I‚Äôm sorry for every misunderstanding that widened the distance, for the ache I added to your own. I know neither of us can rewind that and I need you to know; my heart has never been careless with you. In fact, my caution at times was the culprit; the truth is, I was scared to lose you in this lifetime too and scared for us to carry the ache of absence again.

Even through the distance and trials we have faced, my love, I still choose you, not in some fever-dream of perfection, but in the true, honest way two hearts return again and build home. If you ever wondered whether anyone would truly choose you, knowing the weight of the ache, the answer is yes, darling. I choose you, over and over, in every uncertain hour, in every vision of tomorrow.

I walk with you in the quiet corridors of my mind, sharing laughter I imagine between us over coffee, the way your eyes might crease when you‚Äôre tired, the comfort of leaning shoulder to shoulder, saying nothing, just letting the world be gentler together for a while.

I ache to learn the language of your hand in mine, sharing laughter, tears, and quiet, but even now, you are here, carried gently in my longing, a warmth I refuse to give up, the one I my heart chooses again and again, even in the dark.

I hope you find this and I hope to one day share these words with you in a more personal way. Know that somewhere, someone carries the memory of you before memory, choosing you gently, again and again. I wait for you in the in-between, hand and heart extended, hoping we can stay in the dance together, side by side.

Always yours,

But so many things went wrong on race day that it's tainted the joy I should feel for having completed it.

* The last 20-minute stretch of our driving route to the race that morning was inexplicably shut down without any warning from Google Maps, and we were re-routed into bumper-to-bumper traffic, which effectively added 25 minutes to our drive time and killed most of my early check-in plan.
* Once we got there, we found that the other end of that road closure blocked access to our paid parking spot, so hubs dropped me off in the vicinity of the race area so he could find another spot at zero-dark-thirty in the morning in a part of a major city we weren't familiar with that was also plagued with construction.
* I studied the maps of this place and through I knew how to get to the check-in site from our parking site, but it was tucked down in the midst of some of that construction and the main paths down to it were closed; I had to wander around some not-so-well-lit areas by myself to follow the detours.
* I woke up 4 hours early that morning to drink coffee and have a small bite to eat so that I'd be able to empty my bowels before the race start, but the race vendor didn't provide any port-a-johns themselves, and the only one available to the more than 75 runners was one construction site port-a-john 300+ yards away. I walked another 300+ yards back up to the main street and found some others that were open, but turns out it doesn't matter anyway because...
* All the stress and anxiety of the morning bound everything up; I couldn't relax enough to go. I figured I would hit the actual bathroom that the race coordinators said would be at the 2.1-mile mark, as running can help loosen things up. We were also told that there were ""usually"" port-a-johns along the route at various points (think of it like a long, linear park), and there might even be additional ones from the bike race that was running parallel to us (we learned that's what caused the unannounced road closures...)
* I lasted until I got to the promised bathroom site only to be told the facilities were closed for broken pipes and that I would have to keep going and use the woods if I needed to. And yeah, I needed to, so that's what I did.  I added 3 extra minutes to my race time trying to find a place off the path enough to retain some of my dignity and cover up the output. Don't even ask about my now-chapped ass from...well, anyway. Side note: there were no port-a-johns anywhere else on the race route. None.

So yeah. Some of this--like the unexpected road closures and my body's unwillingness to work with me--is no one's fault, really. But I wish the vendor (not sharing their name because I don't know that I should...) would have mentioned all of the construction in the area, and I really wish they had scoped out the toilet situation ahead of time and let everyone know. I mean, it's not like I've never had to poop in the woods before, but I don't feel I should have had to during this race. Or am I expecting too much from the race vendor?  Do they typically not provide these things? Not looking for answer really, just venting. :(

ETA: I finished at 2:32:59, with a 11:41 avg pace, which is about 30 secs. more than I average on shorter runs usually, but my goal was just to complete it before the cut-off time, which was 3:15:00. :\^\\",1,1761540648.0,XXRunning,2,1.0,False

1oh5kgl,https://github.com/dtormoen/tsk,"TSK: an open source agent sandbox, delegation, and parallelization tool. Safely run multiple fully autonomous Codex agents on the same local repo in parallel!","I built TSK as a way to give agents long running tasks, let them run fully autonomously, and let multiple agents work independently and safely in parallel. I wanted a way to easily delegate work to them and not have to babysit an agent as it works or get blocked working on code myself. I want to review an agents work when it is done the same way I would review a coworker's pull request rather than having to babysit an agent all the way through.

Here's an example to show TSK addresses this:

```bash
tsk run --type feat --name greeting --description ""Add a greeting for users each time they run a command in TSK"" --agent codex
```

For this command, TSK will do the following:

* Copy your repo
* Create a docker image with the codex agent and your tech-stack e.g. rust, python, Go, Node, etc.
* Mount the repo copy into the docker container and set up a forward proxy to limit file and internet access
* Mount your Codex configuration
* Give your agent instructions using your description and the ""feat"" task type which includes repetitive but important instructions like ""write unit tests"", ""update documentation"", and ""write a detailed commit message""
* After the agent finishes, TSK puts a branch with the finished feature in your repository

While it is running, you can work in your repository, have TSK orchestrate more agents, or go get yourself a coffee.

Additionally, TSK also supports:

* A shell mode which sets up the sandbox for interactive use. Great when combined with a multiplexer to manage multiple interactive sessions. It also creates a branch in your repository when you finish working interactively
* Codex and Claude Code agents, hopefully more in the future
* Queuing tasks and running multiple tasks in parallel with the `tsk server`
* Launching multiple agents in parallel on the same task to compare results

I finally got around to adding Codex support today so I wanted to share with you all. One cool thing you can do now is give the same instructions to both Codex and Claude Code at the same time and compare their output side by side.

TSK has been a big accelerator for my own work, but I'd love to get your feedback!",1,1761540246.0,codex,5,1.0,False

1oh5bww,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1oh5bww/lovers_in_the_storm/,Lovers in the storm,"I sat there completely amazed at the beauty that laid before my eyes. The sun was slowly revealing itself, spreading its warmth across my body, and illuminating what once was inky blackness to crystal clarity. We were always at the mercy of Mother Nature‚Äôs fickle mood, slowly bobbing away, vulnerable like a turtle on its back. 

But as I laid there watching the water glisten in all its glory, the waves rocked me into a cocoon of peace, washed away all my worries. The crashing of waves sounded like a symphony to my ears. I could feel the loving hold of Mother Nature. The smell of the ocean was my coffee in the morning. That crusty salt smell always brought a smile to my face. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the serenity above board as below deck, millions of carbon based life forms bustled around with daily chores; eat and not get eaten. 

I was brought back to reality by a tap on my shoulder. I looked up and my morning just became infinitely better. 

‚ÄúHey babe, why are you up so early?‚Äù she asked. 

She looked unnaturally beautiful for someone who just woke up. Large caramel dipped eyes looked at me inquisitively. 

‚ÄúI have never seen you move a muscle before 12 in the afternoon and only after I drag your sorry ass out of bed‚Äù 
‚ÄúI had to pee and I got distracted‚Äù. 

She gave me one of her famous ‚Äúyou are hopeless‚Äù smiles and curled up next to me on the deck chair. My eyes scanned the horizon, trying to imprint this image into my brain for a slow day at work.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite something, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite beauti-‚Äù 
‚ÄúBeautiful!, completing each other‚Äôs sentences‚Ä¶.Aww Sarah could we get any cuter?‚Äù.

Cosmetic surgery would be required for her to roll her eyes any further. 

‚ÄúDavid, I love you and all that but it‚Äôs 8 in the morning, shhhh‚Äù. 

I laughed and wrapped my arms around her, she fit perfectly across my body. She wasn‚Äôt perfect but I‚Äôll be damned if she wasn‚Äôt close enough. High cheekbones and slightly chubby cheeks which annoyed her but I found adorable.

 Her tanned arms spread across my torso and I noticed her biceps. Damn she has been going to the gym a lot. I could feel her warm breath on my chest. I took a deep breath in and all I got was morning breath 

‚ÄúDayum Sarah go brush your teeth, you nasty bruh‚Äù with an exaggerated dying breath I pushed her off the chair. 

‚ÄúYou once wore the same underwear for a week, why are you complaining?‚Äù 
‚ÄúHey! I was trying to set a record‚Äù. 

She smiled for possibly a micro-second then it was gone. She walked away and my eyes followed her but caught the clock anxiously blinking at me. The red dots converged to tell me it was 9:30 in the morning. I yawned at the clock and went back to day dreaming. 

She came out in her lazy day clothes, shorts and a sleeveless tee but armed with a fishing rod. I have been dating her for 3 years and yet I still get remnants of the same butterflies in my stomach when I see her. 

She playfully prods me with the fishing rod ‚ÄúYou ready to lose Capitano?‚Äù 

I yanked the fishing rod and she came with it. She fell in my lap and I said ‚ÄúI was born ready.....wait no that‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù

 ‚ÄúJust grab your rod, you idiot‚Äù. 

We sat beside each other, mano y mano with our rods in the sea. The waves peacefully rocked us but I could vaguely make out a dark cloud far in the distance. Was I just imagining it? I put it out of my mind.

 Sarah turned towards me, flashed her dimples and one eyebrow arched. I knew what was coming. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make it interesting, the first to catch a fish wins and the loser has to eat part of the bait‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah alright, I‚Äôm game‚Äù. 

Fueled by my desire to not eat anything squishy or squirmy, I picked up my rod, ever so gracefully arced it and watched it sail away into the water.
 I turned on the radio and settled into my seat. We sat in comfortable silence, which said a lot more about our relationship than words ever would.

 She looked at me ‚ÄúAre you enjoying the sea?‚Äù ‚ÄúI get to sit and not do anything for extended periods of time, what‚Äôs not there to like?‚Äù 

She laughed ‚ÄúOh god David. I swear I‚Äôm married to an uncle.‚Äù Her face went completely red and I started laughing. 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it enough punishment that I‚Äôm dating you. There isn‚Äôt enough alcohol in the world for me to marry you‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHardee-har har. Guess who isn‚Äôt getting anything later tonight?‚Äù    
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just joking. You know I love you‚Äù. 

We went back to catching fish and I watched her give the sea a mixture of the stink eye and a puppy dog face because that might magically help her catch some fish. I just stare at her in complete amazement by the fact that I love this girl. 

I completely zoned out for another couple of minutes with this thought just bumping around in my brain. 

‚ÄúDavid‚Äù she said. 

I didn‚Äôt respond, staring out at sea. My train of thought was already leaving the station with no possible space for any more passengers. 

‚ÄúDAAVIID!‚Äù she shouted. I looked up and she had that weird spark in her eye. 

‚ÄúThis is my jam!‚Äù 

She keeps doing this thing where she would break out into random songs, making extremely awkward eye contact while moving her body in directions that were even more awkward. This was her dancing. Some might say it was her peacock dance. Possibly the most awkward interpretation of the peacock dance but who am I to judge. 

After 3 years, I still haven‚Äôt figured out whether I need to join into this nonsensical dance, provide back-up dancing or stand up in applause. I mainly just make awkward eye contact while she finishes her dance number. 

As time passes painfully slow, after she finished, she looked at me like she has just performed in Madison Square Garden and her fans are screaming out her name. I had to emulate over 18,200 of her screaming fans. After she whipped that nae nae for the last time, I just awkwardly smiled. Yeah, it has been 3 years and I still don‚Äôt know what to do.

 A sudden tug brought our attention to the fishing pole, Sarah lunged at the fishing pole with fierceness I have only seen once before on a separate occasion. She laughed manically as she reeled in the line, I watched this huge figure attached to the end of the hook and said a small prayer for my taste buds. 

She pulled on the line and gave me a smile, a smile that would have been slightly sadistic even I didn‚Äôt know her better. My eyes lowered in defeat, glanced upward at this creature which would make me eat the dirt or in this case, the bait.

 I started laughing, slowly at first but then progressively louder till I was rolling on the ground. She looked at the hook, flustered. At the end of the hook sat a size eight leather brown shoe, the only thing aquatic about it was the seaweed hanging from the top. 

She sat down in defeat. I looked at her and said ‚ÄúYou really are quite the fishing expert. I‚Äôm not that familiar with this particular species of fish. Would you please enlighten me?‚Äù 

‚Äúha-ha, quite the comedian today aren‚Äôt you? At least after an entire hour I am the only one who has caught somet- Holy shit, there is a really tiny fish swimming inside the boot!‚Äù 

she emptied out the boot and an insignificantly tiny fish popped out ‚ÄúVICTORY IS MINE!‚Äù 

I softened my face and from my survival instinct to not taint my taste bud, I gave her my best puppy dog face ‚ÄúBabe, you know I love you right? And I mean honestly, you are going to be kissing this same mouth. Do you want me to have worm breath?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶..Bow down to your one truly Khalisee and I might forgive you, my sun and stars‚Äù       
 
‚ÄúWith the amount you have been going to the gym, I think I might be Khalisee and you are Khal Drogo‚Äù

 This led to a wrestling match which left us panting after five minutes. We settled in our seats and watched the sun slowly soften as the evening breeze cooled us down. Life is so simple with this girl.

 She looked out at sea and said ‚ÄúIf we keep heading straight we might reach Australia‚Äù. The air tightened. The calm smile I had was lost 

‚ÄúSarah, we promised not to-‚Äù 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

 We sat outside in silence and watched the sun slowly dip into the horizon leaving us with an orange hue in the sky. I dragged myself out of my seat to make dinner 

‚ÄúHey babe, I‚Äôm going to start making dinner. Join me when you want to‚Äù 

She mumbled something under her breath. I started cooking dinner and she walked in. 

‚ÄúDavid, Can we please talk about this?‚Äù 

I slowly put down the spoon and sighed ‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou know what! We can‚Äôt just avoid this conversation till the last moment!‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere is nothing to say.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúTHERE IS A LOT- Damn it David, you are making me cry‚Äù

 ‚ÄúI love you so fucking much but it never works out. Long distance never works out. I have to take that job in Australia. That‚Äôs it. Those are the facts. Why would you want to ruin this holiday by bringing that up?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs driving me crazy and I can‚Äôt just bottle in my feelings. So this is it? We are done, three years of this relationship. All the memories. Why can‚Äôt we just try?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou know perfectly well why. All our friends who have tried long distance have failed. You just end up hating each other by the end of it all. I want to end our relationship on our terms not because of the distance. I don‚Äôt ever want to end up hating you‚Äù

 Silence filled the air. Drops of rain slowly fell and the pitter patter of the rain filled the silence. We cooked and ate in silence. The rain became heavier as we slowly chewed our food, looking down at the plate. I looked outside with concern

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting bad isn‚Äôt it? Can you switch on the weather report?‚Äù I asked anxiously.

‚ÄúDo it yourself‚Äù 

‚ÄúSarah I love you, please don‚Äôt be this way. Can we just enjoy the time we have left and not be so bitter about this. Don‚Äôt be sad that it is over, smile that it happened.‚Äù 

‚Äú-but it doesn‚Äôt have to be over‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSarah, can you plea- Jesus what was that?‚Äù 

A huge wave knocked the railings off the front of the boat. I was knocked off my feet. I got up and peeked outside. Through the haze of rain I saw a huge wave approaching

 ‚ÄúBRACE YOURSELF‚Äù I screamed.

I lunged at Sarah and held her in a tight cocoon. We were thrown across the room and I slammed into the wall. But I didn‚Äôt let her go. Another wave forced the boat into an almost vertical position.

 From the outside it might have seemed like the boat was ascending to the sky. I was thrown against another wall and knocked unconscious. I woke up with the door to the deck wide open and blood slowly trickled into my mouth. 

‚ÄúSarah! Where are you?!‚Äù 

My hand was sprained and I had a gash on my head but with adrenaline pumping through my system, I felt invincible. 

I ran outside and saw Sarah clinging to the railing, slowly slipping away into the water which maliciously called out her name. 

‚ÄúSarah! Hold on‚Äù I ran across the deck and extended my arm. 

‚ÄúGrab on!‚Äù She clung tightly to the railing inches from the water which seemed so murderous.

 ‚ÄúSarah! I won‚Äôt let go. Grab my hand‚Äù 

Rain fell even harder, almost trying to make me slip. My hair was plastered to my forehead but she held onto my arm and I yanked her onto the deck with all my remaining strength. 

There were ropes wildly swinging and I held them with a fierce will to survive. I could feel myself slipping to unconscious as the last remnants of my strength was being used to hold on to the ropes. 

I woke up in a sterile room, warm and comfortable. I tried moving my arm and pain shot through my body, I fell back unconscious. I woke up again but Sarah was there, stroking my hair. I looked up into those coffee colored eyes and I just felt much better 

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked in shock. 

‚ÄúYou blacked out but you still held onto me and the ropes. The storm subsided and a rescue chopper brought us to the nearest hospital. The doctors cleaned the wound as much as they could but- David, I love you so much and I just can‚Äôt think about sharing my life with anyone else. Especially not after something like this. I just had to tell you this‚Äù.

 I looked down to find the source of the numbing pain to my body. I looked at my arm and it looked like it went through a blender. Skin was completely ripped off, hanging by a thread. I didn‚Äôt feel much though. 

The answer laid in my other arm, attached to my arm was a drip releasing drops of honey into my body. 
I looked at the bag ‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶ Honey‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNothing, sorry‚Äù. 

I laid there watching the clouds go by. ‚ÄúSarah, I love you so much and I was so scared to lose you. I don‚Äôt know what I am ever going to do without you. I would say you are the one but I don‚Äôt believe in that nonsense. But what I do believe is that we can make this work. You have been my exception for a lot things. First person that I have willingly taken photos with. First person that I have wanted to introduce to my parents. First person that I have ever loved so much and so unconditionally. And now the first person I‚Äôll be doing long distance with.‚Äù

 I looked up and I saw a couple of raindrops fall onto her lap. She smiled and curled up next to me on the bed. 

‚ÄúSarah, to prove how serious I am- pass that packet of wedding rings‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThe wedding rings‚Äù 
‚ÄúThose are onion rings‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I said-Sarah, I love you and I want to do every single cheesy romantic thing we see in the movies. Travel the world and buy you roses every day. Confess my undying love for you when it rains. The whole deal. Will you marry me?‚Äù

 The drops of rain suddenly increased in pace and she kissed me fully on the lips. 
‚ÄúDavid I love you and only you, so obviously yes!‚Äù

 I put on the wedding ring and I slowly went into a peaceful sleep knowing that when I wake up, she will always be there.

I‚Äôve used Google to search for pornographic movies/images? Did you really have to say boobies in parentheses? I mean breasts are already disgusting enough by themselves but you have to use a ‚Äòcute‚Äô terminology? So I‚Äôll say never just because you really piss me off when you talk about breasts, they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ugh. Fark? Is that? It‚Äôs the question, Fark? Is that like a combination of quark and fuck?

Oh, well, gesundheit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you addicted to the Internet? Let‚Äôs see if I am‚Ä¶ I mean I can already answer that, I‚Äôm not addicted to the Internet I just use it out of‚Ä¶indifference because, well, whatever. The only thing I‚Äôm addicted to is life and I don‚Äôt enjoy that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne: Do you find that you stay online longer than you intended? Well I don‚Äôt intend to be online at all, so‚Ä¶sometimes I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo: Do you prefer the excitement of the Internet to intimacy with your partner? Well‚Ä¶ those prostitutes I have locked in the basement aren‚Äôt really receptive to my kindness, so uh‚Ä¶ I always have to end up beating them then they end up dying and I have to bury the body, whatever‚Ä¶ so, it‚Äôs just not a fun process, I‚Äôm not going to do it anymore. I mean I‚Äôm trying to overcome that problem that I have where I kidnap prostitutes, lock them in my basement‚Ä¶so I‚Äôll say‚Ä¶ I do prefer it, I do prefer to use the Internet because it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not as fun as you guys think it would be.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, Three: Do you neglect to use proper English? Do you neglect household chores to spend more time online? Well, I neglect basically everything, so‚Ä¶sometimes?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour: Does your work/schoolwork suffer because of the amount of time you spend online? Oh yeah, sure, the reason why I‚Äôm unemployed and not in school, yeah that‚Äôs definitely because I‚Äôm addicted to the Internet, yeah that‚Äôs a good explanation.‚Äù

‚ÄúFive: Do you form new relationships with others online? Umm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking to myself right now so it doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of an indication that I‚Äôm forming relationships so I‚Äôll say never.‚Äù

‚ÄúSix: Do others in your life complain to you about the amount of time you spend online? Others in my life? What‚Äôs that? I‚Äôve never heard of that concept, never or rarely.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven: Do you become defensive or secretive whenever anyone asks‚Ä¶ I always say ask, I mean I always say ass, usually when someone is pronouncing ask, they say axe, but I say‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt pronounce the K so I just basically say ass and I have to force myself into saying ask. Um‚Ä¶ am I getting defensive because I‚Äôm going on a tangent about this question? Sometimes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed that your job performance/productivity suffers because of your time spent online? Definitely because you know‚Ä¶ the reason why I‚Äôm unemployed is because I‚Äôm addicted, that‚Äôs the explanation I‚Äôm lazy and addicted.‚Äù

‚ÄúNine: Do you check your e-mail before something else that you need to do? Well‚Ä¶ by definition, yes \[laughter\] I mean‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm being too pedantic but the question is of course, for everyone, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúTen: Do you snap, yell or act annoyed if someone bothers you while you‚Äôre online? I always snap, yell and get annoyed when someone bothers me when I‚Äôm online, heh.‚Äù

‚ÄúThirteen: Do you fear that life without the Internet would be empty, boring or joyless? There is no life without the Internet, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt answer a question like that so I‚Äôll say never or rarely because the question is nonsensical.‚Äù

‚ÄúFourteen: Do you find yourself saying ‚Äòjust a few more‚Äô‚Ä¶ oh, um‚Ä¶ that, uh sorry, the batteries in my headphones just got depleted so that sounded really weird. What was I doing? (rustling sounds) Do you find yourself saying ‚Äòjust a few more minutes‚Äô when online? Well, why not? Often or regularly‚Ä¶this is getting really boring.‚Äù

‚ÄúFifteen: Do you feel preoccupied with the Internet when offline or fantasize about being online? And I‚Äôm never offline so I‚Äôll say never.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you lose sleep due to being online? Yes.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you try to hide how long you‚Äôve been online? Yes.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you choose to spend more time‚Ä¶Yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever tried to cut down? Yes. And failed? No, of course not because I already said yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you feel depressed, moody or nervous when you‚Äôre offline? Does it go away once you are back online? That‚Äôs an interesting question. Why would someone be depressed when they‚Äôre offline, but they‚Äôre moody‚Ä¶ mean they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ perfectly fine once they get back online? What would the Internet be serving to do? People think‚Ä¶ a normal person would say ‚Äòit‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre using the Internet to fulfill something that‚Äôs missing otherwhere, otherwise in their life‚Äô, if they don‚Äôt apply that same principle to life itself‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll say ‚Äòwhy do I want to pursue anything at all? I‚Äôm not addicted‚Äù and if they do admit that they‚Äôre addicted to life, they do it with a little happy face like ‚ÄôHeyRuka‚Äô did, oh yeah life is addicting, haha, giggle.‚Äú

‚ÄúLife is an addiction and‚Ä¶ so paranoid someone‚Äôs listening to me talking right now. Anyway‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú20, I‚Äôll just answer ‚Äòoften‚Äô‚Ä¶score my quiz‚Ä¶ 23, which means that I‚Äôm net addicted, possible. The last quiz in this psychcentral website is ‚ÄòAre you addicted to psychic hotlines?‚Äô‚Ä¶ I thought by psych, that this website meant psychology but probably didn‚Äôt mean psychic the entire time because this entire website is pretty retarded.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich mental disorder do you have? Quizfarm‚Ä¶ oh I wanna know, I fuck farm animals so I‚Äôm sure this is the website where I can find out why I do that. Which mental disorder do you have? The thought of eating three cheeseburgers makes you want to puke‚Ä¶ you eat three cheeseburgers and puke‚Ä¶ agree, but I don‚Äôt eat three cheeseburgers so I‚Äôll answer um‚Ä¶maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo: It seems you‚Äôre always on some sort of diet? By definition, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you just see all those germs squirming around on your keyboard right now‚Ä¶ why did you have to remind me of that? Now I‚Äôm going to have to go have‚Ä¶ uh, what do they call those? A panic attack. It‚Äôs so obvious that panic attacks are culturally induced, anyway, those germs squirming around on your keyboard right now‚Ä¶yeah I have really good vision, I can see them, agree.‚Äù

‚ÄúForgetting to turn off the oven has a catastrophic meaning‚Ä¶ well it does when it burns my house down like it has the last three times.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost things in life can be looked at as all-good or all-bad‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs an interesting question too. All-good or all-bad‚Ä¶well, I mean can life be looked at as all-bad? No because that‚Äôs something that people don‚Äôt understand about my position, they would say‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd interpret me saying that life is bad, when really life is good, and that‚Äôs the problem. Life is good by definition and‚Ä¶ \[sigh\] maybe I should ask a psychic if I‚Äôm ever going to be able to express myself more clearly. So most things in life can be looked at as all-good or all-bad, I will say‚Ä¶whatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe roll and the lions may be because I think I‚Äôll wear my beach ball fall tomorrow‚Ä¶that makes perfect sense to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing makes you feel more in control than eating nothing but celery for days ata time? Oh that‚Äôs what those new anorexics do, I don‚Äôt eat anything, that‚Äôs how in control I am so I‚Äôll say disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you so tired throughout the day that you can‚Äôt sleep at night? Uh‚Ä¶ is that one of those other incoherent questions that can be um‚Ä¶ a way to determine if you have schizophrenia because that question doesn‚Äôt make sense?

--

After I finally conquered the game‚Äôs brooding male lead, the System granted me a special perk.

„ÄêYou can now view the male lead‚Äôs location at any time, including his exact distance from anyone else.„Äë

„ÄêThis way, you‚Äôll never have to be afraid of losing him again! „Äë

A few months later, the physical distance between the man who was supposed to love me and the woman he supposedly despised was shrinking rapidly.

I stared blankly at the numbers on my internal display: [-7 inches], [0], [-7 inches], [0]‚Ä¶

""Can I just cash out the affection points and go home?"" I asked, my voice flat.

„ÄêThat‚Äôs a negative, Host! You are permanently bonded to the male lead. And besides, he‚Äôs crazy about you! He just can‚Äôt control his‚Ä¶ physiological needs!„Äë

Fine. I pulled out my burner phone and sent a text to my beloved male lead: [Give me $10 million, or I'll tell your wife you're cheating.]

Seconds later, his distance from the other woman went from [-7 inches] to [10 feet].

The System‚Äôs voice crackled with panic. „ÄêWhat are you doing?„Äë

""Oh,"" I said, a slow smile spreading across my face. ""I'm going to play with him. Until this bond breaks.""

Ethan was quick to reply to my burner.

[Who is this? What are you to Olivia?]

[What cheating? Do you have proof?]

Tch. He had me there. I didn‚Äôt have anything more concrete to hold over his head.

After a few minutes of silence, I figured he was trying to figure out a way to trace me. But then, his distance from Isabelle began to shrink again, and the numbers returned to their sickening rhythm: [-7 inches], [0], [-7 inches], [0]‚Ä¶

Seriously? Is he a Pomeranian in heat?

As I stewed in frustration, the System regained its smug tone.

„ÄêSee? You should just give up. Ethan genuinely loves you. His body just enjoys the thrill Isabelle gives him. He can‚Äôt help it.„Äë

„ÄêHow about this? I‚Äôll give you a succubus buff. You can work on making his body so addicted to you that he‚Äî„Äë

I ignored it. A spark of an idea hit me, and I walked straight to the garage.

The moment I pulled the car out of the main gate, my phone erupted with a frantic call from Ethan.

""Liv? Where are you going?""

""Answer me. Don't you forget, you have no one in this world but me. Don't even think about taking a single step out of my sight.""

As the story‚Äôs obsessive, controlling male lead, Ethan had implanted multiple trackers under my skin. The second I stepped off the property, alarms blared on his phone.

See how inhumane this setup is? The male lead gets to have his body and soul exist in separate zip codes, while the female lead is supposed to sit in a gilded cage and count her fingers.

That‚Äôs why the moment his affection score hit 100, I made a demand to the System.

""I want to be Ethan's equal.""

My intention was to get half of his assets.

But this romance-obsessed System, with its corporate-level reading comprehension, assumed I was just jealous. It took the initiative and gave me this ‚Äúperk‚Äù to track Ethan‚Äôs distance from other people.

And now, I finally understood how to use this supposedly useless ability.

I suppressed a laugh, seeing his distance from Isabelle still locked at [-7 inches].

""But, baby,"" I cooed into the phone, ""you're with Isabelle right now, aren't you?""

1

Silence for a few seconds. Then, a disbelieving, sharp laugh.

""Liv, how can you even think that? You know how much I despise that woman.""

""Hmph!""

A faint, feminine pout echoed through the receiver. It was almost imperceptible.

Then came the dull thud of a body hitting the floor. The distance tracker updated: [3 feet].

He must have kicked her off the bed.

I forced a sob into my voice. ""She really is with you?""

Ethan‚Äôs tone finally tipped into panic. His words came out in a rush. ""No, Liv, don't overthink this. I'm coming home right now to explain. Just don't leave the house!""

The moment he hung up, a transfer notification for $10 million hit my burner phone‚Äôs account.

[I don't know who you are, but take the money and stay away from her.]

I rolled my eyes.

Whenever I‚Äôd tentatively asked him for money in the past, his eyes would turn bloodshot, as if I‚Äôd triggered some primal defense mechanism.

""Your food, your clothes, your entire life is provided by me. What do you need so much money for? Are you planning to leave me?"" he‚Äôd hiss. ""Don't even think about it, Olivia.""

So flexible, that morality of his. Unwilling to spare a dime for me, but happy to drop millions to cover up an affair.

Ethan‚Äôs 100% affection score was no joke. He drove like a maniac. I hadn‚Äôt even made it ten miles before his car cut me off. He wrenched me out of my driver‚Äôs seat and crushed me in a fierce hug.

""Liv, you're not going anywhere‚Ä¶""

After he‚Äôd half-dragged, half-carried me back into the villa, I focused my senses again. The distance between him and Isabelle was [15 feet].

He actually brought her back with him. Did he stuff her in the trunk?

As I was pondering this, a cup of tea was placed in front of me.

""Here, Liv. Drink this. It‚Äôll calm your nerves.""

A suspicious white powder floated on the surface, a blatant insult to my intelligence.

‚Ä¶ Was he planning to drug me unconscious and then screw Isabelle right next to me?

What a sick game.

Ethan‚Äôs expression was dark as he gripped my chin, his voice dangerously low. ""Be a good girl, Liv. I don't want to force you. We can talk about everything after you wake up.""

I silently estimated Isabelle's hiding spot, then shoved Ethan away with all my might, snatching the teacup and flinging its contents behind the sofa.

""Ah!""

A disheveled Isabelle leaped out, clutching her head.

This perk wasn't useless at all. It was a god-tier affair-buster and blackmail-assister.

My face twisted into a terrifying mask, my eyes locked on the two of them. I mimicked Ethan‚Äôs own chilling tone.

""Baby,"" I whispered, ""isn't having me enough for you?""

2

Ethan was the classic possessive archetype. Before I won him over, he was an untouchable ice king. Afterward, he became a possessive shadow, a ghost haunting my every move. He forced me to quit my job, forbade me from seeing anyone‚Äîfirst men, then eventually, anyone at all. He isolated me until I couldn't leave his sphere of control. His obsession was so absolute he needed to know the exact schedule of my bathroom breaks.

And Isabelle was the classic villainess. In the early stages, she relentlessly tried to frame me, even kidnap me, but Ethan always thwarted her and retaliated brutally on my behalf.

I thought that once I‚Äôd secured Ethan‚Äôs affection, Isabelle would be written out of the story for good. But I was wrong. On the surface, he drove her family to bankruptcy, but behind the scenes, he propped up her new career, funded her design studio, and sent her extravagant gifts on holidays. He acted disgusted by her in public, yet he was helplessly drawn to her in private, their shared animosity fueling a toxic passion.

He gave the villainess endless freedom and illicit pleasure, while I, the heroine, was locked away in a cage.

This world granted him limitless power and capital. No matter how depraved his actions, he faced no consequences. What was a little infidelity in the grand scheme of things?

The only variable was me, the female lead. He was terrified of me dying. A paper cut on my finger was enough to send him into a frenzy.

And that was my only leverage.

If I treated him the way he treated me‚Äîif I became unhinged and suicidal over his every move‚Äîhow would he react?

Best-case scenario, I gain control over him. Worst-case scenario, I actually succeed in ending my own life and get sent back to my own world.

Playing the part of the psycho? It was a win-win.

3

Ethan‚Äôs arm tightened around me, the pressure almost bone-crushing. ""Liv, let me explain. She followed me here, I‚Äî""

Isabelle, composing herself, ran a contemptuous gaze over me. ""Relax, Olivia. I have no intention of stealing him from you."" She smirked. ""The CEO and I just have a‚Ä¶ mutually beneficial arrangement. I have my own career and my own life. Unlike you, a helpless vine who can‚Äôt survive without a man to cling to.""

I turned to Ethan, adopting his signature paranoid, whispery tone. ""A mutually beneficial arrangement? Is she telling the truth?""

Ethan flinched as if I‚Äôd stepped on his tail. He whirled on Isabelle, his eyes feral. ""Shut your mouth!"" He turned back to me, his voice desperate. ""Liv, don't listen to her lies. My heart belongs only to you! My body‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs secondary‚Ä¶""

A distorted smile, a mirror of the one he wore when he was losing control, stretched across my face. ""So, your secondary body‚Ä¶ that can be given to anyone you please?""

I shoved him away with surprising speed, snatched a small, steel letter opener from the coffee table, and without a moment‚Äôs hesitation, pressed it to my own throat.

""NO!""

Ethan‚Äôs roar was ragged, torn from his soul. He lunged at me like a madman, his hand clamping around my wrist. The blade‚Äôs tip was a hair's breadth from my skin. His face was ashen, his entire body trembling.

""Let me die! Don't touch me with hands that have touched someone else!"" I screamed, throwing his own past accusations back at him.

Isabelle stood by, arms crossed, sneering. ""Seriously? What is this, the dark ages? The whole 'I'll kill myself' routine? Ethan, is this really the kind of neurotic drama queen you‚Äôre into?""

""GET OUT!"" Ethan, finding an outlet for his terror and rage, spun around and slapped Isabelle across the face so hard she stumbled and fell. ""Get the hell out of here, and don't you ever show your face in front of me and Liv again!""

Isabelle cradled her cheek, staring at him in disbelief before scrambling to her feet and fleeing.

4

The villa was suddenly silent, save for the sound of our two ragged breaths. Ethan pried the letter opener from my hand and pulled me into a tight, trembling embrace, still reeling from the shock.

""Liv, she was lying. Please, believe me‚Ä¶""

I let out a shuddering breath and whispered in the most devoted, heartfelt tone I could muster, ""Really? Then from now on, will you share your entire schedule with me? Everything. And don't you dare lie."" I leaned in closer, my voice dropping to a chilling murmur.

""If you betray me, I'll kill you. Then I'll kill myself.""

Ethan‚Äôs body went rigid.

He looked down at me, and the first emotion that surfaced in his eyes was not fear, but a twisted, ecstatic joy.

""Liv‚Ä¶ you love me that much?""

A beat, then‚Ä¶ ""Okay. I promise. I'll tell you everything, wherever I go. I'll give you all the security you need.""

But behind the elation, I saw it. A flicker of fear. It was the look of a predator, accustomed to being the sole hunter in its territory, suddenly catching the scent of an equal.

The System's voice pinged in my head, sounding incredulous.

„ÄêMale Lead's character profile is collapsing by 5%. Current bond strength with Host: 95%!„Äë

He could track my every move. Now, so could I.

That‚Äôs what I call fair.

5

After ""calming me down,"" Ethan secretly replied to my burner account.

[You have the money. If you interfere in my life with Olivia again, I will find you. Don't think I can't.]

He couldn't. This burner account was one I‚Äôd used to tip him off back when Isabelle was trying to frame me. Its signal was untraceable, even for him.

The System grumbled, [I knew I shouldn't have given you that feature‚Ä¶]

To distract me, Ethan showered me with luxury goods. But his promise to share his schedule never materialized. A master manipulator doesn't take the demands of his pretty little bird seriously.

I played my part, reverting to the obedient, sweet girl he thought he controlled. He stroked my hair, satisfied.

""Get ready,"" he said. ""I'm taking you somewhere special tonight. For your birthday.""

That evening, he took me to a lavish ballroom at the city‚Äôs finest hotel. The birthday gala was filled with guests, and, just as I expected, Isabelle was there.

Under the pressure of Ethan's glare, she reluctantly approached me, forcing a stiff smile. ""Happy birthday, Olivia. I was out of line the other day, just teasing you. The CEO and I have a purely professional relationship. I hope you didn't misunderstand.""

I linked my arm through Ethan‚Äôs, my own smile a picture of innocence. ""Oh, don't worry about it. I trust you, and I trust my baby."" I squeezed his arm. ""From now on, I won't doubt you again‚Ä¶ unless I see something with my own two eyes.""

The fake smile on Isabelle‚Äôs face froze. She clearly hadn‚Äôt expected me to be so magnanimous.

Ethan, however, was delighted by my response. He wrapped an arm around my waist and, in a loud voice, addressed the room. ""And on this happy occasion, I have some wonderful news to share. Liv and I are getting engaged!""

The hall erupted in applause and congratulations. The hatred in Isabelle‚Äôs eyes was practically overflowing, but under Ethan‚Äôs warning gaze, she didn‚Äôt dare make a scene.

Halfway through the party, Ethan was cornered by a group of business partners. I watched as Isabelle shot me a defiant smirk, leaned in close to a slightly drunk Ethan, and whispered something in his ear. Then, one after the other, they slipped out of the ballroom.

[Ethan and Isabelle Distance: 15 feet‚Ä¶ 3 feet‚Ä¶ 0‚Ä¶]

I took out my burner phone again.

[Snacking on the side again, Mr. CEO? Time to tell your fianc√©e. The price is $20 million this time.]

He was likely in a state of frustrated arousal. His reply was blunt: [Fuck off].

I set down my champagne flute and, following the distance tracker, calmly made my way upstairs to the guest suites. I stopped in front of one of the rooms.

Running a food business online is exciting, but if you‚Äôre using WooCommerce, you‚Äôve probably noticed one major problem: customers want options. Extra cheese on pizza, gluten-free bread, choosing your spice level, adding fries on the side, and not having a proper customization system can quickly lead to confusion, order errors, and lost revenue.

That‚Äôs where the [PH Product Add-Ons plugin](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/) for WooCommerce comes in. It allows you to turn your regular menu into an interactive, fully customizable ordering experience without writing a single line of code. Whether you're selling pizza, coffee, cakes, sushi, or full meals, this tool helps you offer personalization while keeping things simple to manage.

**Common Challenges WooCommerce Restaurants Face**

Even with WooCommerce, running a restaurant-style ordering system isn‚Äôt straightforward. You may run into:

* **Limited built-in options**: WooCommerce variations are basic and can‚Äôt handle multiple toppings or addons easily.
* **Manual custom requests**: Notes like ‚Äúextra spicy‚Äù or ‚Äúno onions‚Äù are hard to track and often get missed.
* **Dietary needs**: Allergies and ingredient preferences need a clear, structured way to be captured.
* **Pricing issues**: No easy way to charge extra for premium toppings or sauces.
* **Operational chaos**: Staff can easily overlook custom instructions, causing wrong orders or unhappy customers.

The solution? Use [product add-ons](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/) to let customers pick exactly what they want and ensure your kitchen gets every detail clearly.

**Add Custom Menu Options in WooCommerce**

Using the [PH Product Add-Ons plugin](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/), you can turn your WooCommerce food items into customizable menu products in just a few clicks.

Add Customization Fields Like:

* **Text Fields**: For cooking instructions (e.g., ‚Äúextra spicy‚Äù, ‚Äúno sugar‚Äù).

Want to see how it works in real stores? Check out the original guide here:[Customize Your WooCommerce Restaurant Menu](https://www.pluginhive.com/customize-woocommerce-restaurant-menu/).

**Real-World Example: A Pizzeria Using WooCommerce**

Let's you run an online [pizzeria ](https://www.pluginhive.com/woocommerce-pizza-builder-with-product-addons/)through WooCommerce. Your customers don‚Äôt just order a pizza; they build their pizza. They want extra cheese, no onions, stuffed crust, gluten-free base, garlic dip on the side, maybe even schedule it for delivery at 7:30 PM sharp. Offering all of this manually or through separate product pages can quickly become a nightmare.

**The Common Challenges**

* WooCommerce, by default, doesn‚Äôt support complex meal customization without forcing you to create dozens of product variations.
* Customers want to choose multiple toppings, sides, and sauces in one go.
* Some need to leave dietary notes like ‚Äúno dairy‚Äù or ‚Äúextra crispy‚Äù.
* You also need a way to set pricing for each add-on (like an extra $2 for premium cheese).
* And most importantly, you need all this information clearly passed to your kitchen without missing anything.

**The Fix: Add Everything on One Product Page**

With the [PH Product Add-Ons plugin](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/), you can turn a single pizza product page into a fully customizable ordering form:

* Customers can select multiple toppings through checkboxes
* Add personal notes or dietary instructions in text fields
* Choose pickup or delivery time using a date and time picker
* See prices update in real-time as they select extra toppings
* Every selection is automatically saved in the order details for your staff

https://i.redd.it/0d4tidk00lxf1.gif

Your customers get full control over their order (which they love), and you get a streamlined system that increases revenue and avoids mistakes.

**Best Practices for Using Product Add-Ons in Your WooCommerce Restaurant**

To get the most out of menu customization, keep these simple tips in mind:

* **Use images** for toppings and extras so customers can decide quickly and confidently.
* **Highlight customization options** clearly on product pages to encourage upgrades.
* **Track which add-ons are popular** to improve your menu and increase profits.
* **Make sure your staff understands add-on orders** to avoid mistakes during preparation.
* **Use scheduling or** [booking integrations](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-booking-and-appointments/) if you offer pre-orders, pickups, or catering.

These small steps help you deliver a smooth ordering experience, reduce errors, and boost your average order value, all while keeping your menu easy to manage.

 **Final Thoughts**

Offering menu customization isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù; it‚Äôs what modern customers expect. By using the [PH Product Add-Ons plugin](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/), you give them a smooth ordering experience, reduce errors, and boost your average order value effortlessly.

Your WooCommerce restaurant becomes more flexible, your customers feel in control, and your staff gets clear instructions; everyone wins.

### Parse the Odds: A Tightrope Walk Between Two Sides

Let‚Äôs crunch the numbers like a kangaroo in a calculator factory. The odds for this A-League clash tell a story of two teams squaring off with *zero* margin in the spreads (both at -0.0), meaning bookmakers see this as a 50-50 coin flip. For the moneyline, Macarthur FC is the slight favorite at +245 (implied probability: 40.8%), while Adelaide United sits at +265 (37.7%), leaving the draw at +365 (27.4%). If you‚Äôre betting on a draw, you‚Äôre basically telling the bookmakers, ‚ÄúI trust chaos more than strategy.‚Äù

The total goals line? A pedestrian 3.0 goals, with ‚ÄúOver‚Äù priced at 1.87-1.98 and ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù at 1.87-1.95. In other words, the bookies think this game will be as explosive as a wet firecracker‚Äîmaybe a couple of quick strikes, but don‚Äôt expect a World Cup final.

### Digest the News: Macarthur‚Äôs Wobbles and Adelaide‚Äôs Circus Act

Macarthur FC‚Äôs A-League season started like a toddler on a tricycle: one bumpy loss to Brisbane. But hey, they‚Äôve been dazzling in the AFC Cup, thumping Beijing Guoan 3-0 and drawing with CAHN. Their star man, Rafael Duran, is the team‚Äôs emotional anchor‚Äîunless he‚Äôs busy dodging Adelaide‚Äôs attack, which is as relentless as a koala on a coffee binge.

Adelaide United, meanwhile, just beat Sydney 2-1, which is no small feat. Their attackers, Craig Goodwin and Bernardo Oliveira, are like a pair of magicians who‚Äôve learned to juggle soccer balls *and* set them on fire. The problem? Macarthur‚Äôs defense has already leaked goals this season, and Adelaide‚Äôs midfield looks ready to stage a *La La Land* performance in front of the net.

Injuries? Both teams are missing key pieces‚ÄîAdelaide‚Äôs Adam Taggart

‚ÄúI seek explanations for things and learn quickly, I excel in what I do‚Ä¶ well, what would they say? Well, everyone would say exactly like me so I‚Äôll just click that, go to the next question.‚Äù

‚ÄúI purchase only practical things, never spending more than I can afford, I always take precautions and never splurge‚Ä¶you‚Äôre damn right because you need to‚Ä¶be a fiscal conservative, you see? I mean, you‚Äôve gotta be a survivalist you see, you can‚Äôt waste your money because survival is so important that you need to‚Ä¶ you-you can‚Äôt just splurge on things. \[laughter\] Let‚Äôs see. Unless you‚Äôre splurging on your male secretary in the bathroom‚Ä¶ \[laughter\] But that‚Äôs just like age-old splurge, so I‚Äôll say‚Ä¶ opposite of me. I mean, exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have difficulty understanding abstract ideas and am not interested in speculating about things‚Ä¶ well you‚Äôve gotta be practical you see, you‚Äôve gotta live in the real world‚Ä¶ exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI respect and empathize with others‚Äô feelings and appreciate their viewpoints‚Ä¶ of course I don‚Äôt, them terrorists are wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no problems with making friends, I warm up to others quite quickly, I act comfortably around people and am able to talk openly about myself‚Ä¶ well I‚Ä¶ I do repress that, that uh queer curiosity thing in me, but otherwise I‚Äôll say‚Ä¶ exactly like me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calm even in tense situations and don‚Äôt lose my head, I can stand criticism and am not easily offended‚Ä¶ ah, playing a conservative person is so boring. I‚Äôll just say exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want every detail taken care of and continue until everything is perfect, I want everything to be just right‚Ä¶ oh so now we‚Äôre going to be Goldilocks or whoever, gonna have to click the middle answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to ponder over things and I can‚Äôt stand being alone, I don‚Äôt spend time in contemplation or introspection‚Ä¶well if you‚Äôre too introspective then you don‚Äôt get to communicate with anyone, if you‚Äôre too extroverted then you never learn anything about yourself, your inner self, so I‚Äôm going to have to select the inner answer, the center answer, maybe‚Ä¶just right.‚Äù

‚ÄúI take an interest in other people‚Äôs lives and am deeply moved by others‚Äô misfortunes, I like to do things for others‚Ä¶well if you do too many things for yourself then you can‚Äôt help other people, but if you do too many things for other people you can‚Äôt help yourself so I‚Äôll have to select the middle answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you see, this, this, \[laughter\] person at the coffee table uh‚Ä¶ they started to drink too many espressos and listening to too many obscure albums so they‚Äôre getting a little feisty so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI value cooperation over competition, I avoid conflicts and criticizing other people‚Ä¶ random answer. Aren‚Äôt I so obscure? I mean, aren‚Äôt I‚Ä¶ I mean my answer is so unique.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not as strict as I should be and let my mind wander off and do things in a halfway manner‚Ä¶ halfway manner? I can answer halfway, isn‚Äôt that a nice pun? I‚Äôm so funny, I‚Äôm so‚Ä¶I‚Äôm So obscure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI search for the meaning of things and tend to analyze everything, I like to get lost in thought and enjoy examining my feelings. It‚Äôs so conformist to be taking this test so I‚Äôm just going to back out and go back to the main list.‚Äù (clicking sounds)

‚ÄúHere we go, which one was that‚Ä¶ the next one is short personality test. No‚Ä¶all these things are kind of boring now. Dr. Phil‚Äôs personality test? Well he‚Äôs really insightful, I remember there was this child who hit his mother on his show once, he said ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt do that, kids hitting mom‚Äôs? How can you possibly conceive of such an idea?‚Äô So Dr. Phil is really wise, I wanna take his personality test, I wanna know what he thinks about me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne: When do you feel your best? Hm, okay I‚Äôll answer honestly Dr. Phil‚Ä¶um, when do you feel your best? Any time that there isn‚Äôt sunlight, because I fucking hate the sun, so not during afternoon and early evening. Probably‚Ä¶ late at night, that implies that the sun isn‚Äôt up. Usually I walk fairly fast with long steps and I make people think that I‚Äôm going through some panic attack.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen talking to people, do you stand with your arms folded or your hands clasped, or one of your hands on your hips‚Ä¶does anyone actually do that? \[laughter\] Does anyone actually talk to people with their hands on their hips.‚Äù

‚ÄúTouch or push the person to whom you are.. \[laughter\] yes, I go around, go around pushing people. Touch or push the person to whom you are talking, or play with your ear hair, or whatever‚Ä¶ well I don‚Äôt really do any of those, I just stand completely still so‚Ä¶ um, I‚Äôll say I keep my hands on my hips.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen relaxing, do you sit with‚Ä¶ um I don‚Äôt really relax, so I‚Äôll just say‚Ä¶ one leg curled under you, that seems like an intermediate answer. That‚Äôs kind of creepy though, one leg‚Ä¶ oh, okay, they would be sitting down, not standing, \[laughter\] I was interpreting it to mean that they would be standing one-legged, curled under‚Ä¶okay it‚Äôs really not that funny but um‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, when something really amuses you, you react with a big appreciative laugh? A laugh but not a loud one, a quiet chuckle, a sheepish smile? Ah, why‚Äôs it called a sheepish smile? I‚Äôll just select that one because it‚Äôs so confusing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you go to a party or a social gathering‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt but‚Ä¶ make a loud entrance so that everyone notices you? Oh definitely, I definitely make a loud entrance so that everyone notices me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven: you are working very hard, concentrating hard and you‚Äôre interrupted, do you welcome the break, feel extremely irritated, or are you between these two extremes? Well‚Ä¶ it depends. When I‚Äôm concentrating very hard on something, I‚Äôm probably trying to overcome some deprivation, or some belief about deprivation. And when someone speaks to me? They would‚Ä¶ allow that deprivation to still survive, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ feel extremely irritated.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich of the following colors do you like the most? Why-why is that entire sentence italicized? Which of the following colors do you like the most? It reminds me of how the, in comics they have these random words bolded. I can‚Äôt be the only one who thinks this. Does anyone else think that‚Ä¶ they select those words completely arbitrarily when they bold them? Anyway, which of the following colors do you like the most? Okay I‚Äôll answer, don‚Äôt get angry at me‚Ä¶ um, I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶ wh-what? Why is yellow/light blue an answer? And why is dark blue/purple an answer? Well that makes sense, but yellow and light blue? Well I hate yellow because it‚Äôs kind of like the light that the sun casts, but I do like light blue because it neutralizes the orangeish-yellowish type of color, and it‚Äôs still appealing in and of itself so‚Ä¶ uhh, I‚Äôm conflicted and since I‚Äôm conflicted I might as well select a conflicted answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúNine: When you‚Äôre in bed at night, in those last few minutes before going to sleep‚Ä¶oh no, I hate that moment! That‚Äôs when the boogeyman comes out. \[laughter\] You are: stretched out on your back, stretched out your‚Ä¶oh, whatever. Being molested by the boogeyman, but other than that I‚Äôll say with your head on one arm, why not? I‚Äôm pretty much allover the place.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou often dream that you are falling, fighting or struggling, searching for something or somebody, flying or floating, usually have dreamless sleep? Dreams are always pleasant, the last two don‚Äôt apply. Sometimes I fly or float, usually when I‚Äôm ina quasi-lucid dream state I can leap around, that‚Äôs kind of fun. Searching for somebody or something, usually I‚Äôm trying to get away from something. Fighting or struggling? Uh‚Ä¶struggling, I guess getting away from someone? Falling? Well I fall in my dream, when I‚Äôm falling asleep, literally‚Ä¶I actually do. I‚Äôm falling \[?\] but when I‚Äôm actually dreaming? Why not answer flying or floating?‚Äù

‚ÄúScore my quiz now, what do you think about me Dr. Phil? Wow, Dr. Phil answered quickly, I wonder if this is the real Dr. Phil evaluating me. I scored a total of 40, is that a good thing? I‚Äôm a loyal friend, others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical, they see you as clever, gifted or talented but modest. Um‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a really stupid answer because that can apply to anyone‚Ä¶ not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who‚Äôs extremely loyal to the good friends you make, and expects the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken. So pointlessly vague‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúScoring key, 40‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs strange, I‚Äôm in the upper limits of loyal friend, I almost became the lively center of attention. That‚Äôs me, that‚Äôs me. Well thanks Dr. Phil‚Ä¶ onto the miscellaneous quizzes. Generally for fun only? Well I‚Äôm a fun guy apparently, so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFacebook intensity quiz, how intense a Facebook user are you? I have three Facebook profiles. How many total Facebook friends do you have? Well 400 of course, because I‚Äôm the fun guy who likes to be the center of excitement or whatever. In the past week, on average, approximately how many minutes per day have you spent on Facebook? More than three hours, bitch. Facebook is part of my everyday activity? Strongly agree. I‚Äôm proud to tell people I‚Äôm on Facebook? Strongly agree. Facebook has become a part of my daily routine? It‚Äôs my best friend. I feel out of touch when I haven‚Äôt logged into Facebook for a while? Strongly agree. I feel I am part of the Facebook community? Of course. I would be sorry if Facebook shut down? Strongly agree. I‚Äôve used Facebook to check out someone I met socially? True or false, isn‚Äôt that the point of Facebook? They give you their Facebook account and then you look at what they wrote. I use Facebook to learn more about other people in my classes? Is the person who made this Facebook quiz retarded? I think that‚Äôs the entire point of Facebook, to, so that you can spread information. I use Facebook to learn more about‚Ä¶ strongly agree, of course, I don‚Äôt even use it and I‚Äôm saying strongly agree, of course I would if I did use it. I use Facebook to keep in touch with my old friends‚Ä¶um, well‚Ä¶ I guess strongly agree they would? I use Facebook to meet new people, strongly agree, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been on Facebook for four years or more? Of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúScore my Facebook quiz, 73? Facebook intensity is high, never would‚Äôve guessed. Am la geek?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho founded Apple? Steve Jobs, I guess, I don‚Äôt know. Wozniak is the geek I don‚Äôt know, randomly guessing. Favorite magazines? Budget Living? Oh yeah because you need to lead a sustainable life so you have to have a budget you see, because you can‚Äôt propagate life unless you‚Äôre doing it sustainably.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a comped subscription to my favorite, I don‚Äôt know what a comped subscription is but of course I get one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get into online arguments against‚Ä¶I mean I get into online arguments about Perl vs PHP, oh no but they forgot about Ruby so I have to say regularly.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ordered Half Life 2 or downloaded it as soon as it was available for Verve? Okay, it‚Äôs Valve‚Ä¶ I hate the design of pretty much all video games, they‚Äôre very poorly designed, especially something like Half Life 2 but I know that it‚Äôs Valve, not Verve. So I might as well answer, what‚Äôs Half Life 2?‚Äù

‚ÄúI eat my first meal of the day before 1PM‚Ä¶ um, okay maybe I‚Äôm a geek because I‚Äôm asking how do you define day? Do you mean by the solar cycle or do you mean based on my sleeping schedule? I mean, it depends. What do you consider a day to be? So, I‚Äôll say never, because I never eat, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúRed Pill or Blue Pill? I know that‚Äôs a Matrix reference but‚Ä¶ Blue Pill because I like blue? I don‚Äôt know. I understand the Red Pill/Blue Pill reference. Well of course because you remember that question where‚Ä¶ in one of those previous quizzes, where you have to ask someone else and get embarrassed? Of course I understood that Red Pill/Blue Pill reference.‚Äù

‚ÄúI access the Internet primarily via, or however you pronounce that in Latin, AOL, EarthLink,

Library, DSL, Cable Modem? All of them, that‚Äôs how much of a geek I am so I‚Äôll say who knows?‚Äú

‚ÄúI wear or regularly carry this many mobile data/MP3 devices‚Ä¶carry all of them, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy primary computer screen is this large? 14-17 because less is more.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last time I went on vacation was‚Ä¶ actually I‚Äôm seriously going to think about that one, when was the last time I went on vacation? I‚Äôve never wanted to go on vacation, I always hated when my parents brought me on them. So I‚Äôll say never.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love and watch anime? Well, I loved Gundam 0080 when I was 10, so I‚Äôll say‚Ä¶ sometimes?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the office or at school I socialize by‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not in the office or school and I don‚Äôt socialize. I‚Äôm no-one, I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù

--

After I finally conquered the game‚Äôs brooding male lead, the System granted me a special perk.

„ÄêYou can now view the male lead‚Äôs location at any time, including his exact distance from anyone else.„Äë

„ÄêThis way, you‚Äôll never have to be afraid of losing him again! „Äë

A few months later, the physical distance between the man who was supposed to love me and the woman he supposedly despised was shrinking rapidly.

I stared blankly at the numbers on my internal display: [-7 inches], [0], [-7 inches], [0]‚Ä¶

""Can I just cash out the affection points and go home?"" I asked, my voice flat.

„ÄêThat‚Äôs a negative, Host! You are permanently bonded to the male lead. And besides, he‚Äôs crazy about you! He just can‚Äôt control his‚Ä¶ physiological needs!„Äë

Fine. I pulled out my burner phone and sent a text to my beloved male lead: [Give me $10 million, or I'll tell your wife you're cheating.]

Seconds later, his distance from the other woman went from [-7 inches] to [10 feet].

The System‚Äôs voice crackled with panic. „ÄêWhat are you doing?„Äë

""Oh,"" I said, a slow smile spreading across my face. ""I'm going to play with him. Until this bond breaks.""

Ethan was quick to reply to my burner.

[Who is this? What are you to Olivia?]

[What cheating? Do you have proof?]

Tch. He had me there. I didn‚Äôt have anything more concrete to hold over his head.

After a few minutes of silence, I figured he was trying to figure out a way to trace me. But then, his distance from Isabelle began to shrink again, and the numbers returned to their sickening rhythm: [-7 inches], [0], [-7 inches], [0]‚Ä¶

Seriously? Is he a Pomeranian in heat?

As I stewed in frustration, the System regained its smug tone.

„ÄêSee? You should just give up. Ethan genuinely loves you. His body just enjoys the thrill Isabelle gives him. He can‚Äôt help it.„Äë

„ÄêHow about this? I‚Äôll give you a succubus buff. You can work on making his body so addicted to you that he‚Äî„Äë

I ignored it. A spark of an idea hit me, and I walked straight to the garage.

The moment I pulled the car out of the main gate, my phone erupted with a frantic call from Ethan.

""Liv? Where are you going?""

""Answer me. Don't you forget, you have no one in this world but me. Don't even think about taking a single step out of my sight.""

As the story‚Äôs obsessive, controlling male lead, Ethan had implanted multiple trackers under my skin. The second I stepped off the property, alarms blared on his phone.

See how inhumane this setup is? The male lead gets to have his body and soul exist in separate zip codes, while the female lead is supposed to sit in a gilded cage and count her fingers.

That‚Äôs why the moment his affection score hit 100, I made a demand to the System.

""I want to be Ethan's equal.""

My intention was to get half of his assets.

But this romance-obsessed System, with its corporate-level reading comprehension, assumed I was just jealous. It took the initiative and gave me this ‚Äúperk‚Äù to track Ethan‚Äôs distance from other people.

And now, I finally understood how to use this supposedly useless ability.

I suppressed a laugh, seeing his distance from Isabelle still locked at [-7 inches].

""But, baby,"" I cooed into the phone, ""you're with Isabelle right now, aren't you?""

1

Silence for a few seconds. Then, a disbelieving, sharp laugh.

""Liv, how can you even think that? You know how much I despise that woman.""

""Hmph!""

A faint, feminine pout echoed through the receiver. It was almost imperceptible.

Then came the dull thud of a body hitting the floor. The distance tracker updated: [3 feet].

He must have kicked her off the bed.

I forced a sob into my voice. ""She really is with you?""

Ethan‚Äôs tone finally tipped into panic. His words came out in a rush. ""No, Liv, don't overthink this. I'm coming home right now to explain. Just don't leave the house!""

The moment he hung up, a transfer notification for $10 million hit my burner phone‚Äôs account.

[I don't know who you are, but take the money and stay away from her.]

I rolled my eyes.

Whenever I‚Äôd tentatively asked him for money in the past, his eyes would turn bloodshot, as if I‚Äôd triggered some primal defense mechanism.

""Your food, your clothes, your entire life is provided by me. What do you need so much money for? Are you planning to leave me?"" he‚Äôd hiss. ""Don't even think about it, Olivia.""

So flexible, that morality of his. Unwilling to spare a dime for me, but happy to drop millions to cover up an affair.

Ethan‚Äôs 100% affection score was no joke. He drove like a maniac. I hadn‚Äôt even made it ten miles before his car cut me off. He wrenched me out of my driver‚Äôs seat and crushed me in a fierce hug.

""Liv, you're not going anywhere‚Ä¶""

After he‚Äôd half-dragged, half-carried me back into the villa, I focused my senses again. The distance between him and Isabelle was [15 feet].

He actually brought her back with him. Did he stuff her in the trunk?

As I was pondering this, a cup of tea was placed in front of me.

""Here, Liv. Drink this. It‚Äôll calm your nerves.""

A suspicious white powder floated on the surface, a blatant insult to my intelligence.

‚Ä¶ Was he planning to drug me unconscious and then screw Isabelle right next to me?

What a sick game.

Ethan‚Äôs expression was dark as he gripped my chin, his voice dangerously low. ""Be a good girl, Liv. I don't want to force you. We can talk about everything after you wake up.""

I silently estimated Isabelle's hiding spot, then shoved Ethan away with all my might, snatching the teacup and flinging its contents behind the sofa.

""Ah!""

A disheveled Isabelle leaped out, clutching her head.

This perk wasn't useless at all. It was a god-tier affair-buster and blackmail-assister.

My face twisted into a terrifying mask, my eyes locked on the two of them. I mimicked Ethan‚Äôs own chilling tone.

""Baby,"" I whispered, ""isn't having me enough for you?""

Ethan was the classic possessive archetype. Before I won him over, he was an untouchable ice king. Afterward, he became a possessive shadow, a ghost haunting my every move. He forced me to quit my job, forbade me from seeing anyone‚Äîfirst men, then eventually, anyone at all. He isolated me until I couldn't leave his sphere of control. His obsession was so absolute he needed to know the exact schedule of my bathroom breaks.

And Isabelle was the classic villainess. In the early stages, she relentlessly tried to frame me, even kidnap me, but Ethan always thwarted her and retaliated brutally on my behalf.

I thought that once I‚Äôd secured Ethan‚Äôs affection, Isabelle would be written out of the story for good. But I was wrong. On the surface, he drove her family to bankruptcy, but behind the scenes, he propped up her new career, funded her design studio, and sent her extravagant gifts on holidays. He acted disgusted by her in public, yet he was helplessly drawn to her in private, their shared animosity fueling a toxic passion.

He gave the villainess endless freedom and illicit pleasure, while I, the heroine, was locked away in a cage.

This world granted him limitless power and capital. No matter how depraved his actions, he faced no consequences. What was a little infidelity in the grand scheme of things?

The only variable was me, the female lead. He was terrified of me dying. A paper cut on my finger was enough to send him into a frenzy.

And that was my only leverage.

If I treated him the way he treated me‚Äîif I became unhinged and suicidal over his every move‚Äîhow would he react?

Best-case scenario, I gain control over him. Worst-case scenario, I actually succeed in ending my own life and get sent back to my own world.

Playing the part of the psycho? It was a win-win.

Ethan‚Äôs arm tightened around me, the pressure almost bone-crushing. ""Liv, let me explain. She followed me here, I‚Äî""

Isabelle, composing herself, ran a contemptuous gaze over me. ""Relax, Olivia. I have no intention of stealing him from you."" She smirked. ""The CEO and I just have a‚Ä¶ mutually beneficial arrangement. I have my own career and my own life. Unlike you, a helpless vine who can‚Äôt survive without a man to cling to.""

I turned to Ethan, adopting his signature paranoid, whispery tone. ""A mutually beneficial arrangement? Is she telling the truth?""

Ethan flinched as if I‚Äôd stepped on his tail. He whirled on Isabelle, his eyes feral. ""Shut your mouth!"" He turned back to me, his voice desperate. ""Liv, don't listen to her lies. My heart belongs only to you! My body‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs secondary‚Ä¶""

A distorted smile, a mirror of the one he wore when he was losing control, stretched across my face. ""So, your secondary body‚Ä¶ that can be given to anyone you please?""

I shoved him away with surprising speed, snatched a small, steel letter opener from the coffee table, and without a moment‚Äôs hesitation, pressed it to my own throat.

""NO!""

Ethan‚Äôs roar was ragged, torn from his soul. He lunged at me like a madman, his hand clamping around my wrist. The blade‚Äôs tip was a hair's breadth from my skin. His face was ashen, his entire body trembling.

""Let me die! Don't touch me with hands that have touched someone else!"" I screamed, throwing his own past accusations back at him.

Isabelle stood by, arms crossed, sneering. ""Seriously? What is this, the dark ages? The whole 'I'll kill myself' routine? Ethan, is this really the kind of neurotic drama queen you‚Äôre into?""

""GET OUT!"" Ethan, finding an outlet for his terror and rage, spun around and slapped Isabelle across the face so hard she stumbled and fell. ""Get the hell out of here, and don't you ever show your face in front of me and Liv again!""

Isabelle cradled her cheek, staring at him in disbelief before scrambling to her feet and fleeing.

The villa was suddenly silent, save for the sound of our two ragged breaths. Ethan pried the letter opener from my hand and pulled me into a tight, trembling embrace, still reeling from the shock.

""Liv, she was lying. Please, believe me‚Ä¶""

I let out a shuddering breath and whispered in the most devoted, heartfelt tone I could muster, ""Really? Then from now on, will you share your entire schedule with me? Everything. And don't you dare lie."" I leaned in closer, my voice dropping to a chilling murmur.

""If you betray me, I'll kill you. Then I'll kill myself.""

Ethan‚Äôs body went rigid.

He looked down at me, and the first emotion that surfaced in his eyes was not fear, but a twisted, ecstatic joy.

""Liv‚Ä¶ you love me that much?""

A beat, then‚Ä¶ ""Okay. I promise. I'll tell you everything, wherever I go. I'll give you all the security you need.""

But behind the elation, I saw it. A flicker of fear. It was the look of a predator, accustomed to being the sole hunter in its territory, suddenly catching the scent of an equal.

The System's voice pinged in my head, sounding incredulous.

„ÄêMale Lead's character profile is collapsing by 5%. Current bond strength with Host: 95%!„Äë

He could track my every move. Now, so could I.

That‚Äôs what I call fair.

After ""calming me down,"" Ethan secretly replied to my burner account.

[You have the money. If you interfere in my life with Olivia again, I will find you. Don't think I can't.]

He couldn't. This burner account was one I‚Äôd used to tip him off back when Isabelle was trying to frame me. Its signal was untraceable, even for him.

The System grumbled, [I knew I shouldn't have given you that feature‚Ä¶]

To distract me, Ethan showered me with luxury goods. But his promise to share his schedule never materialized. A master manipulator doesn't take the demands of his pretty little bird seriously.

I played my part, reverting to the obedient, sweet girl he thought he controlled. He stroked my hair, satisfied.

""Get ready,"" he said. ""I'm taking you somewhere special tonight. For your birthday.""

That evening, he took me to a lavish ballroom at the city‚Äôs finest hotel. The birthday gala was filled with guests, and, just as I expected, Isabelle was there.

Under the pressure of Ethan's glare, she reluctantly approached me, forcing a stiff smile. ""Happy birthday, Olivia. I was out of line the other day, just teasing you. The CEO and I have a purely professional relationship. I hope you didn't misunderstand.""

I linked my arm through Ethan‚Äôs, my own smile a picture of innocence. ""Oh, don't worry about it. I trust you, and I trust my baby."" I squeezed his arm. ""From now on, I won't doubt you again‚Ä¶ unless I see something with my own two eyes.""

The fake smile on Isabelle‚Äôs face froze. She clearly hadn‚Äôt expected me to be so magnanimous.

Ethan, however, was delighted by my response. He wrapped an arm around my waist and, in a loud voice, addressed the room. ""And on this happy occasion, I have some wonderful news to share. Liv and I are getting engaged!""

The hall erupted in applause and congratulations. The hatred in Isabelle‚Äôs eyes was practically overflowing, but under Ethan‚Äôs warning gaze, she didn‚Äôt dare make a scene.

Halfway through the party, Ethan was cornered by a group of business partners. I watched as Isabelle shot me a defiant smirk, leaned in close to a slightly drunk Ethan, and whispered something in his ear. Then, one after the other, they slipped out of the ballroom.

[Ethan and Isabelle Distance: 15 feet‚Ä¶ 3 feet‚Ä¶ 0‚Ä¶]

I took out my burner phone again.

[Snacking on the side again, Mr. CEO? Time to tell your fianc√©e. The price is $20 million this time.]

He was likely in a state of frustrated arousal. His reply was blunt: [Fuck off].

I set down my champagne flute and, following the distance tracker, calmly made my way upstairs to the guest suites. I stopped in front of one of the rooms.

""Baby,"" I called out, my voice sweet and clear. ""What are you doing in there?""",2,1761539147.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Days kept flying by in their usual blur into one another, bleak in their lack of distinction. From one gray morning to the deafening silence of the next witching hour, life had become a trailing haze of uneventfulness that connected these points in their dotted line toward nothing at all. The same room, the same house, the same trees, the same pain in the same spots. The same regret from the same mistakes being made over and over again throughout days different in numbering only.

Being someone who had gone through life holding on to the belief that routine was a value set in stone, he couldn‚Äôt help but notice life itself had an interesting way of demonstrating that wasn‚Äôt quite the case. A life that consisted of next to nothing besides a miserable household, a stint through public school, a job at a munitions factory, marriages that had gone nowhere, the army, the trenches and an eventual series of court hearings that had been just as painful as anything so far: all a reminder of the importance of routine, but not anymore than a reminder of the constance of pain. Now, with not much of a routine left, it seemed like pain had filled that void like a leak inside a sinking ship.

And it was amidst this daily blend of nothing good and nothing at all that he tried to find a blind spot, some kind of safe zone square in the middle but at the same time outside of it. It wasn‚Äôt clear to him what he was even trying to do in order to survive what his life had become, but he knew he had to do it one day at a time before wasting any energy trying to spell it out.

In the end, anything short of surviving each day felt like a waste of resources, from the more high concept activities like trying to rationalize it to the more mundane ones like holding onto recent memories. The complete lack of distinction between an empty moment and the next, coupled with the severity of the actual problems life kept hurling at him: the perfect blend for the worst sort of attention drain.

Ivan, or at least who he had once believed himself to be, had died in those trenches. What came back was a lifelong batch of shame and regret piled on top of each other, piloting his mortal coil like a vessel.

The dim light that pierced through the curtain announced another one of those days that begged surviving. Humming and constant, the sound of rain could be felt much more than actually heard, aside from the loud noises of water hitting the old roof or crawling through its many holes, splashing over the pots and pans spread across the house.

Another rainy Monday looked straight through him as he dragged the curtain aside. But was it Monday, even? Keeping track of days was the hardest part for anyone living what seemed like an endless succession of poorly-enjoyed holidays with no friends or family. It had to be Monday, he decided, because this week was going to be his best shot yet at trying to talk to the physician; something he had been eager to do for almost a month, and to which he had been counting the days. He remembered thinking it was just three days away, the day before. So he knew it had to be it. *‚ÄúMonday it is.‚Äù*

Walking through the creaky floorboards, he made his way toward the stairs and saw his old living room from the top. As he stared at the dim light that barely made its way in, all he could think of was how much his house seemed like it had been abandoned long ago, although he had never quite left. It was definitely the weather, but the way his living room on a Monday morning looked as dark as his bedroom made him feel like his day wasn‚Äôt exactly going anywhere before it even started. That thought wasn‚Äôt anything new, however, so he discarded it much the same way he did every morning as he stood on that same spot.

As he tried his best not to stumble down the staircase, he leaned his weight on the banister while feeling the sting at every step of the way. The pains had gotten worse, unsurprisingly, as it was something common when the weather acted up. This was already a common occurrence in most of his joints, but the pain that cursed the right end of his hip bone was like trying to shrug off a fresh injury. The simple act of walking down a flight of stairs early in the morning felt like punishment. But it was barely the worst part of his day, and most importantly, it was still the first.

In the kitchen, he left some water boiling while he pulled aside a flimsy wooden chair and dropped his weight over it. His body felt more like he had gone through a drill rather than a night‚Äôs sleep. Having to catch his breath barely a few minutes out of bed was shameful for him. As he massaged his brow with one hand, he could feel the stale sweat on his skin as well as the tension on his face muscles. It seemed like for all the good a half-decent rest had done for him, the first few minutes of his day had already managed to ruin it.

As the water boiled, he looked around at his greasy kitchen in the dim light and felt a sincere desperation boiling along with it. That sinking feeling he had just experienced on top of the stairs had not let go in the slightest, as much as he tried his best to put it aside. It was like each and every part of the house in which he had spent all his life were different reminders of a wide variety of reasons why he was alone. Just as the living room made him think the place he lived looked abandoned, the kitchen made him think there was no way someone would *choose* to live there.

The memories were ancient at that point, but still fresh as bloodletting. People had come and gone from that house throughout almost half a century, either through their own graves or their own volition. It wasn‚Äôt always a choice, but when it was, it hurt even worse.

The humming sound of the rain outside seemed to be getting louder, and the rhythm of the drops inside the pots and pans was getting more accelerated. He rarely emptied them, and some of the floorboards were starting to get stained with the humidity of the overflow. That whole place seemed like a huge chunk of wood made brittle and darkened by all the water that ran through it across the years.

Ivan felt like he himself wasn‚Äôt that much different, in that regard. A wooden sculpture of a man, an old simulacrum left out to soak in rain water until it was crawling with termites and finally fell to pieces over the tall grass, the husks of its limbs inhabited by bugs, worms and spores until nature claimed all else as well.

He knew that was the fate that awaited his house, after he was long gone. But he was also beginning to wonder if that wouldn‚Äôt be his fate as well, even if just symbolically.

Ivan hated that house. He had grown up in it, spent the best years of his life living in it next to the few people he had by his side at one point or another, and he still hated that place. Everything about it felt like an exercise in revisitation for the absolute worst moments of fear, isolation and pain he had undergone outside of the battlefield. Still waters are known to run deep, and in Ivan‚Äôs case it was his deep-seated hatred of some of these memories that lay beneath the surface.

Already at the end of the painful journey of getting back on his feet, he poured the water and made a fresh pot of coffee, serving a cup for himself and then savoring its bitter, watery taste. That first sip of bottom-shelf brand flavor would possibly be the highlight of his entire day, so he had to make it last.

Lazily slumping forward, he left the kitchen and walked to the small table that sat beside his old recliner. Without having to face the pain of sitting down again, he grabbed one of the orange pillboxes that lay on top of it and poured a pair of capsules on his palm before hurling them inside his mouth followed by a generous sip of coffee. He repeated the process with another three different compartments lying beside the first one, in no particular order.

He didn‚Äôt bother remembering those complicated names anymore. They just wouldn‚Äôt stop changing. All that existed were the crass numbers and letters in black sharpie ink over each label: ‚Äú2 - MORNING‚Äù, or ‚Äú3 - EVENING‚Äù. There was a time when he was more careful about this whole process, afraid of taking the wrong pills at the wrong time. These times were long past, as now he knew mixing up medication by accident was hardly the worst thing that could happen to him.

With his eight o‚Äôclock medication out of the way, he allowed himself the simple pleasure of lying his battered body on the wrinkled leather of his armchair, raising a thin cloud of dust on the impact. Turning on the TV after what seemed like an endless breath of exhaustion, he was surprised by the local news.

Was it even eight o‚Äôclock, anyway? The green hue of the digital clock said he missed the mark by almost an hour and a half, but in the end it didn‚Äôt matter. The medication didn‚Äôt have the same effect as before, and at this point he was basically bargaining for some spare change in the placebo effect currency. He knew he was knee-deep in his bargaining era and, to be honest, he had been enjoying the change of pace so far. Not much else to be happy about, anyway.

‚ÄúHAS EVERYONE GONE *MAD?‚Äù* shouted Jim Schwartzman, because of course he did. ‚ÄúWhat has happened to the people in this country? Have you people lost your minds? Have you gone *insane?* Or even worse, have you gone *soft?‚Äù*

That last word came accompanied by what seemed like a shrivel of disgust, as Jim‚Äôs face thwarted itself into a wrinkled mass of angered concern, his skinny shoulders retracting inside his oversized TV personality blazer. *‚ÄúI wonder what Jimbo‚Äôs screaming about today‚Äù* was a frequent thought that circulated in that house in early mornings like those, and to Ivan it had become a daily ritual of sorts.

‚ÄúYou people think you‚Äôre patriots? You think you‚Äôre *deserving* of everything this beautiful country has done for you? Of having your freedom delivered to you from the claws of that *scum* that wanted to make *slaves* out of you?‚Äù

Jim slammed his fist against his daytime television pulpit, which was really just a regular counter, and started pointing to the camera as it shakily closed in on his face.

‚ÄúWell, *I* think you‚Äôre *cowards!* The whole lot of you! What have *you* done for this country, anyway? You free-loading, opportunistic weaklings, tell me *right now,* what *HAVE* you done?!‚Äù

Ivan was not impressed with the irony of seeing himself of all people in the receiving end of that bit, and thought about how much he had been enjoying that clown show less and less with each passing day. Ever since the war had been won, Schwartzman had set off on a decade-long personal project of degrading into a parody of himself.

During the eerie but still exciting days of political discourse that led up to the civil war, Jim was a respectable political analyst in the journalistic community, taken seriously even by the leftist peers he so famously bashed. During the conflict, he had earned his chops as a brave war correspondent in the grizzly frontlines of the Eastern front, dishing out provocative think pieces and even an autobiography, which Ivan did get to read in the hospital before being honorably discharged. Those were good times to be a patriot; if you could ignore all the blood and the killing, which most of them did.

Fast forward to the decadence of consumerist, highly-neutered life of the post-war republic of over a decade down the line, and you could see Jim‚Äôs credibility at its absolute rock bottom. Now relegated to so-called ‚Äúcommentary duties‚Äù on daytime programming, the man now looked less like an influential figure in any capacity than the political science equivalent of someone‚Äôs decrepit uncle having a stroke at a family gathering.

All that aside, Ivan still had the habit of watching the man on television every morning. Half expecting to be surprised in any positive manner, perhaps, but mostly just scraping the surface of what he could hope to consider genuine entertainment.

At that very moment, for example, he was keeping busy while attempting to deduce the reason Jim was screaming so much. He couldn‚Äôt just skip steps and start shouting at the viewer, for as much as that was what his job consisted of in practice. Being a TV commentator usually implies you‚Äôre commenting on recent news, and it had become a game of sorts for Ivan to try to guess what Jim was basing his rant on.

So far he didn‚Äôt get much to work with, but was caught off-guard when the diatribe wandered off somewhere slightly less vague and more concerning:

‚ÄúHow are we letting this happen? Why aren‚Äôt there people on the streets hunting these foul creatures? Where are the men of our nation, our fathers, our *warriors?‚Äù*

The image cut back to a news report that apparently had been the morning‚Äôs top story. The footage looped on mute while Schwartzman‚Äôs voice kept rolling.

‚ÄúDo you people not realize this could be you, tomorrow? Your *family?* That these people you see before you could very well be your wives, your daughters, the boys you want to raise to protect their *own* families one day? Have you people gone off the deep end that far that you see something like this happening in your own community and you decide the wisest course of action is to do *nothing?‚Äù*

Ivan didn‚Äôt quite squirm, but he did furrow his brow at the sight of what was being shown. It wasn‚Äôt much, considering daytime television wasn‚Äôt shy on restrictions, but what he did see was enough to touch a nerve.

The girls were barely ten years old, and their mother couldn‚Äôt be that far into her thirties. The father was an ordinary man, hardly the type of gun-toting doughboy you‚Äôd see living around those parts, but he could tell that poor bastard must‚Äôve fought like hell to protect the women in his life. The information about the state of the victims that crawled across the screen was succinct, but he could tell that this man barely his own age had gotten the worst of it for trying to fight back. Judging by the wording of the reports, the girls weren‚Äôt even given the chance.

Realizing how much that disturbed him, he took a step back and allowed himself to rationalize how local news agencies and package deal celebrities like Schwartzman were little beyond glorified buzzards. Exploiting the misery of small town folk being preyed upon by unknown threats the government barely had the personnel or the technology to keep at bay was already bad enough as it was, but using it as a stepping stone for a hack like Jimbo to splash around his pseudo-insurectionist dogwater was too much for someone who had paid for democracy with a pound of flesh.

‚ÄúWhere is the government? Where are the authorities? I need to know *right now* if all of this is happening because we‚Äôve been abandoned by those who have sworn to protect us, I need them to come clean *RIGHT NOW* if we‚Äôre on our own or not. Because I fear for myself, *and* my family, and so should you if you know what‚Äôs good for you and the ones you love.‚Äù

Just like Schwartzman himself and everything his brand of so-called journalism had come to represent this far into the post-war years, Ivan hated television. He couldn‚Äôt bring himself to see it as anything more than a sleaze repository, a sewage pipe that sprouted into his living room and flooded his every waking hour with its single flavor of scum.

Paradoxically enough, it was with television, as an entity, that he spent most of his time awake, and a decent portion of his time asleep as well. He was convinced at that point that only tangentially miserable aspects of modern life would fit in a life as miserable as his, which explained why so many things he hated still remained so present.

‚ÄúDo you people realize what this is? Do you have *any clue* of what‚Äôs going on right before your eyes? Do I need to spell it out for you? Well, in that case, I‚Äôll indulge you: *this is punishment from God.* There, I said it. You people don‚Äôt wanna hear it? *Well,* that‚Äôs *TOO BAD.* There it is, you filthy heathens. This is what we get for all the sin and debauchery our people believed they could get away with. Our children, our families being defiled by these fiends, the spawn of the Adversary. We now live in a land forsaken by God, and this is *your* fault. I hope you‚Äôre proud of yourselves. You make me *sick.‚Äù*

He was sitting there for barely a few minutes, but that news report stuck with him in such a way that Ivan already felt that it had been enough television for one day. He tried his best to stay away from local news reports, especially the ones that felt particularly exploitative, but they still managed to sneak up on him and his dormant morbid curiosity. There was something especially vile about their detachment, mostly for the dismissive way in which they exposed the pain and misery of what he considered his community. In a sense, it was almost like a personal attack on his character, but in a way he couldn‚Äôt quite articulate.

‚ÄúThank you Jim, very insightful as always‚Äù, said the generic new guy as the camera cut to him, probably instructed to say these exact words even if Jimbo shot himself on live television. ‚ÄúThis just in: we have official confirmation from the authorities that the severed head found last week in Los Telares *does* in fact belong‚Äî‚Äù

Compared to most news reports that came in from around the country, however, there was no denying that watching gruesome and opportunistic bulletins about townsfolk being found dead or not being found at all was something much less taxing for someone with Ivan‚Äôs very particular concerns. Anything from the stories about the reconstruction efforts along the frontier, to the most recent political maneuvers between Containment lobbyists and politicians, or the less-than-encouraging recent findings by the scientific community was enough to make him want to spend the rest of his days just having to focus on sporadic deaths and disappearances.

‚ÄúAs heinous crimes related to on-going investigations of unverified occurrences of non-catalogued phenomena‚Äî‚Äù

Those were just news reports on television, he kept telling himself, but for some reason it felt almost like a trapdoor opening on its own, revealing all sorts of vermin and creepy crawlies just waiting for an excuse to pour out, strong enough to bust the wood from the hinges like a gust of wind.

‚ÄúWe will proceed with our regular coverage as it develops. Thank you for joining us.‚Äù

At that moment he realized he forgot to touch the remote and had watched the morning news to the end, being welcomed by another episode of what seemed to be the millionth re-run of that Bucky Roswell TV series he despised so deeply. Exploitative journalism was only the beginning, when it came to allowing television to ruin his day: Ivan‚Äôs absolute pet peeve was foreign pop culture, and how it poisoned local outlets like a venereal disease there is no treatment for.

‚ÄúY‚Äôsee ma‚Äôam, ol‚Äô Buck right ‚Äòere may be just a simple feller tryna make an honest livin‚Äô in this Gosh-forsaken land, if y‚Äôall pardon mah cussin‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ira Hinckley‚Äôs style of acting was already annoying enough on its own for how much of a dick he was. Although it consisted of basically nothing else besides putting on a hat and pretending he went by a different name, something about that character made him just way too easy to despise.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll tell ya right ‚Äòere an‚Äô now, ah rolled wi‚Äô boys such as these in mah wild years, and lemme tell ya for a fact that these ‚Äòere ain‚Äôt no regular small time cattle rustlers‚Ä¶¬† No siree, what we‚Äôre dealin‚Äô wit‚Äôere is somethin‚Äô much, much more sinister‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bucky‚Äôs voice made Ivan want to shoot someone over a parking lot squabble. He had a deep-seated contempt for people who talked and dressed like that, especially when they were the same brand of potato-fed backwater yokels as himself but wanted to act like they were characters from some foreign soap opera. The idea that he fought in the war so greedy executives halfway across the world could make money selling cultural slop to his people was the sort of humiliation that made television way harder to bear looking at than it had any right to be.

*‚ÄúBuck‚Äôs battle against the gang of cattle rustlers that terrorizes the peaceful community of Weaver Springs just took a turn for the worst‚Äù,* said the announcer, whose tacky artificiality made it clear he didn‚Äôt think he was being paid enough. *‚ÄúAs he prepares to face the dangers of the unknown, will our hero‚Äî‚Äù*

As his thumb crushed the remote‚Äôs power button, Ivan was met by an eerie visage; his own reflection on the screen. The vague shape of that blurry gray ghost sloped over itself filled him with a sense of dread he wasn‚Äôt really sure he wanted to address. The feeling was made even more jarring by the difference between the blaring noise of the TV set and the humming of the rain. Sprinkled in the midst of the non-silence, the dripping noises all over the house added another layer of desolation to what felt like a nightmare about a lonely, uneventful life.

His horror was still yet to take another step in that direction, however: he looked at the green hue of the digital clock and realized it was only five past ten. He had been sitting there for barely half an hour and he already wished the day was over, while in reality it wasn‚Äôt even noon.

Between the constant pain and the struggle to keep himself distracted, there wasn‚Äôt much happening on the planet he inhabited. His gaze hovered along dusty books piled up to knee height on one of the grimy corners of the living room. They had been there for what seemed like decades, waiting to be put on a bookshelf he never really got around to building instead of buying; or at least just buying, since he wasn‚Äôt going to build.

Those old books were a bitter reminder of his youth. It was hard for him to believe that at one point he had been an actual person with hobbies and interests like anyone else. A man not defined by his trauma or the hardship he endured, but his dreams and aspirations.

How far had fallen from that tree the rotten fruit he spoiled into.

Maybe as an effort to reignite whatever genuine drive was part of his youth, he tried taking up woodworking again after he came home from the war. From his early teenage years to those of his recovery, there had always been a peaceful sense of belonging in the activity. He‚Äôd come to learn just how much time spent on handiwork you feel like you have a natural talent for will always do good by you, and helping fix stuff around the house or building modest pieces of furniture had always been Ivan‚Äôs choice manner of achieving this.

Naturally, that was all in the past. He didn‚Äôt have the motivation or the disposition of his youth any longer, as is common with all of us. But in Ivan‚Äôs case, the poor physical conditioning inflicted by the years of recovery coupled with the daily reckoning with the chronic pains had been the death knell of what was his only genuine occupation.

The results stood around him like a mausoleum. The state of disrepair in which his house laid, with missing pieces of furniture and water pouring in through the ceiling, was all the proof he needed. The small workshop in the back of the house, with the heavy chain on the door held by a padlock he forgot where he left the keys to, was the tomb‚Äôs inner sanctum: racks of tools rusted beyond further use, piles of wooden planks and beams covered by an ancient coat of dust, cans of paint and old tarps inhabited by cobwebs and well-fed spiders.

The dusty heaps of books lying around his house were in their own right a symptom of this defeat, but mainly from another one entirely. Some would have trouble believing thanks to his more rustic sensibilities, but that didn‚Äôt change the fact that Ivan was once a well-read young man. Books of history and tales of knights and brave combatants were his greatest passion in his later boyhood and into his teenage years, and among the chief factors that stimulated his foray not only into the Republican Army, but even in political theory as a whole.

That, of course, was now barely a forgotten relic of an era that couldn‚Äôt be more distant. As many who get to witness the writing of history with their own eyes, Ivan had no interest in the accounts of those who didn‚Äôt, and even those who did as well. Fact or fiction, it all offended his intelligence, mainly for the lack of respect anyone alive had for his own perspective of all he had been through. It had gotten so that he sometimes wished he could just forget how to read, just as an excuse to never have to bear reading some of those lies again.

The trip down memory lane had been long and absorbing to the point that he didn‚Äôt even notice he was already on his feet, having paced across the kitchen toward the coffee pot. Already halfway through his second cup, he leaned back on the grimy counter, distracted from his pain enough to not overthink every movement he made. Maybe that was the medication kicking in after all, or maybe he just wished it was. Whichever the case, it was better than the alternative.

As he paced around in the silence of the rainy morning, he suddenly saw himself walking toward the front door and stepping out onto his front porch. Daylight was shining brighter, but the rain wouldn‚Äôt let up. Seeing it up close instead of just letting his mind drift along the sound, he could see it wasn‚Äôt pouring at all, but instead flowing almost softly.

There was something relaxing about watching the view from his porch all brushed by the rainy haze and the broad strokes of the shades of autumn. It almost felt like a different planet from the suffocating environment of the house; a different life in a different place, much simpler and less punitive.¬†

He looked to his left and saw his dog sleeping, the tip of its nose just barely poking out of the crude dog house that had been there long before the mutt moved in. It was still chained to a heavy iron stake buried halfway into the dirt, as it had always been.

The large mongrel and Ivan had never really seen eye to eye ever since they banded together, but the dog had earned its keep so far. It was useful in keeping him alerted about trespassers as long as it was properly fed, so the partnership could be considered successful for what it was. Ivan was annoyed by the dog‚Äôs constant barking, especially when he knew it had most likely been set off by a squirrel or a racoon, but seeing it sleep so soundly did add to the rare sense of peace he was feeling at that moment.

*‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôll shut up if you manage to sleep.‚Äù*

That was the exact moment he felt something click inside his brain. A missing piece of the puzzle rotating clockwise maybe once or twice before slipping into its proper slot. No, not quite, it was something different. A similar feeling, but different enough to be perceived as such. Not a piece falling into place, but the realization there was an empty slot at the puzzle he hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

The barking. That was it. That‚Äôs what triggered the memory. Not the barking itself, since the dog wasn‚Äôt even awake, but the faint memory of how it sounded. The faint memory of that very specific sound, in a very specific setting. The wind against the naked branches, the creaking of the floorboards along the loud thumps of rushed steps in the dark. The yanking of the chain, the rusty links stirring against each other. The steps in the dark. The barking.

The laughter.

Ivan‚Äôs primitive brain engaged in full alert. He could feel the tension in his eyesight as it scanned the trees from one end of his porch to another. That heated, almost electrifying body-wide sensation of instinctive physical reaction to a danger unseen, unknown. Something common in the days of the war, but not nearly as much in whatever days those were. Which made it all the more disturbing in a way he‚Äôd take hours to explain to someone who‚Äôd never seen armed combat, and still not manage to come across.

He laid his coffee mug on the wide wooden bannister of his porch, a few inches from the beam that sat right beside the front steps. He didn‚Äôt realize it yet, but he would forget that mug on that exact spot and look for it all over the house before noticing that was where he left it. By then, he would have no recollection of the state of mind he was in at that moment, and would still wonder why and how he could even forget a mug half full on his porch in the first place.

Walking down the creaky steps, he saw himself standing in the rain, his gaze fixated in the woods as he slowly took one step at a time toward the battered wet earth of his driveway. He felt ensnared in some sort of ancient spell, a mix between an unsuspecting prey animal driven by a hungering scent and the almost otherworldly sensation of hypnosis, sleepwalking, a drug stupor or perhaps even some yet unknown manner of inebriation. He felt the rain pouring on him much harder than what he had perceived of its strength minutes before, a much less peaceful sensation than merely observing it from a dry, safe distance.

And sure enough, he was suddenly visited by that familiar feeling once again. Of pieces snapping into place, a bigger picture starting to take shape. At first, it wasn‚Äôt quite clear what the memory of the dog‚Äôs barking that night had made snap inside his brain, but standing in the rain that far into his driveway he could feel the breaches on the veils of perception align just about enough to let his mind‚Äôs sight have a glimpse at it.

It was him.

Standing on that same spot, in that same state, on that cold night, however many moons ago it had been.

And for a brief moment, for what barely felt like an entire minute back to back, he was out there once again. Not in the rain, as he was literally, on a physical scale, but out *there*. In the woods. Not the trees that surrounded his house. Not the bucolic countryside that was Weaver Parish, with its short walk to the creek and the old oak tree of his childhood, but the woods that surrounded all of it: his memories of his father, the march across the swamplands, the day of the siege. It was all there, happening at the same time, at the same place, him standing at the exact same spot, his eyes fixed on nothing in particular but also everything his sight encompassed. Trees. Woods. Whatever lies beyond them. The shape of a man. Just a man. No one in particular: just a man. He could be anyone. It doesn‚Äôt matter who he is, or what he looks like, what matters is that he *is* there. Standing right in the middle of it all, just a few steps off-center in the opposite direction from which he approached him. They‚Äôre not supposed to be there. They are *never* supposed to be in the presence of one another, either of them, yet there they are. At the same time, at the same place. About to approach the final threshold. He doesn‚Äôt want to see it. He was there before. He didn‚Äôt want to see it then, doesn‚Äôt want to see it now. But he can see the man standing there, with his back toward him. He wants to get out of there. He wants to go home. But *was* there ever a home to go back to?

The man turns around.

The dog starts barking again.

Ivan is taken back to wherever he was.

Once more, standing in the middle of his driveway, several feet away into the dirt and toward the woods.

This time, soaking wet from the rain. Standing outside on a rainy Monday morning, the water pouring on him, perceived by his body just as much as it went across it.

He looked over his shoulder. The dog had barely just gotten up, and it wouldn‚Äôt stop barking. That made him snap back into place firmly enough to notice the noise, but strangely not enough to be bothered by the rain. He raised his forearms slightly and stared at them from side to side, realizing he was completely soaked. That realization felt so confusing to him it was almost strange, as there was nothing strange in it. He felt tired, more mentally than physically for what seemed like the first time that day, and slumped back toward the house.

Was it the meds? Something else? *What* else? All he could think of at that moment was a dry change of clothes and maybe an extra hour or two of sleep. There was nothing else on his mind. Absolutely and utterly not a single other thing.

He forgot the mug outside. The dog wouldn‚Äôt stop barking.",1,1761539146.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Uh, I must have ADD because I don‚Äôt want to go through this. Mood checker, check my emotions over time‚Ä¶eating disorder screening test, eating attitudes test, OCD screening test. These people who create these tests must have OCD because they‚Äôre trying to categorize everything. PTSD screening quiz‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs not cultural then I don‚Äôt know what is. Oh, for child injury?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does this mean? Because it‚Äôs obvious that PTSD is innate in everyone as a consequence of their childhood. Oh, uhh‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt using it in the correct way. ‚ÄòThe items below refer to a recent injury experienced by your child‚Äô‚Ä¶ having your child was a great injury. Anyway, schizophrenia screening test‚Ä¶ hahaha, no comment. Do I need therapy quiz? Oh, let‚Äôs take the ‚Äòdo I need therapy quiz‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve items below refer to how you have felt and, and one word, and I‚Äôm trusting these people to diagnose me? Felt and behaved during the past month, in capital letters, bolded‚Ä¶ for you to try and indicate the extent to which it is true by checking the appropriate box next to the item.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne: I am concerned about a behavior, feeling, or something I am doing. Uhhh‚Ä¶ what does it mean to be concerned if you‚Äôre not concerned? That pretty much just means‚Ä¶ that you‚Äôre \[sigh\], means that you‚Äôre not insightful. That you don‚Äôt think, how could someone not be concerned a behavior or feeling or something that I‚Äôm doing? You perpetually would be unless you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôve been exposed to culture, you‚Äôre going to be. Very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo: This behavior or feeling has been getting worse in the past few weeks. I guess so because I made my account recently.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree: I have tried stopping or reducing this behavior or feeling on my own. Hm‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a good idea to increase that behavior, so, very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúFour: My attempts at stopping or reducing this behavior or feeling have been successful. Well I can‚Äôt answer that, the question doesn‚Äôt apply to me, so I‚Äôll say ‚Äònot at all‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúFive: I rely on my friends or family‚Ä¶I have friends? I have family? What? To help me with my current troubles‚Ä¶ not at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSix: I‚Äôm finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual. What does it mean to cope with things? I mean‚Ä¶ you can interpret that at face value, but I mean under my whole‚Ä¶ deprivation dynamic. I‚Äôm finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual. If you‚Äôre having difficulty coping, does that mean you‚Äôre having difficulty with the fulfillment or is it that‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ someone who‚Äôs listening to this probably thinks I‚Äôm a retard for not being able to‚Ä¶ figure this out but I‚Äôm not thinking about it in the way you think I am, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused right now and I can‚Äôt really think about things off the cuff like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm finding it more difficult to cope with things than usual‚Ä¶ It could go either way. I mean, it could go in four different directions so I‚Äôll just close my eyes and‚Ä¶ well that wouldn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôll just say not at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having trouble concentrating at work or school‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôm not in work or school, I‚Äôm a loser so I‚Äôll say not at all, heh.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like to think things through or talk about things that bother me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking right now so I‚Äôll say very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúNine: I‚Äôve talked to my family doctor or healthcare professional about the behavior or feeling that‚Äôs troubling me \[laughter\]. If I did that I would not be able to be in this circumstance, right now, so I‚Äôll say no.‚Äù

‚ÄúTen: I‚Äôve talked to my friends or family about the behavior or feeling that‚Äôs troubling me: no.‚Äù

‚ÄúEleven: I‚Äôve read books or went to the Internet to discover more about the behavior or feeling that‚Äôs troubling me. Uh, very much‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve: The final one, I‚Äôve been in therapy before and it‚Äôs helped me. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ oh, okay, good they say, yes but it didn‚Äôt help. So I answered that one‚Ä¶now score my therapy questionnaire, I‚Äôm so excited.‚Äù

‚ÄúI scored a total of thirty-one, I wonder if that‚Äôs out of fifty? I mean I gu-guess that‚Ä¶ it would be pretty good. From the information you have provided, you could be someone who might benefit from‚Ä¶ okay it‚Äôs off \[?\] I knew it was \[laughter\]. Ohh, no it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs if you scored 42 and up. Recommend‚Ä¶ 22 to 42, recommended. Okay, so, I‚Äôm psychotic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWorkplace bullying quiz? What an interesting word bullying is. Quiz? I feel like a retard. A quiz to help you determine if you may be the victim of workplace bullying. I don‚Äôt think that applies to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelationships and sexuality‚Ä¶ask the prostitutes I have locked in my basement. Sustainable marriage quiz, now this is what I was talking about. They operate under this assumption that marriage is somehow a good thing‚Ä¶ ugh, I think you know my position on marriage, haha. (creaking sound in background) Okay, I‚Äôll take the sustainable marriage quiz.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much does being with your partner result in your happ-‚Ä¶.eh I can‚Äôt do this. How deep is your love quiz? That‚Äôs another thing that bothers me, there‚Äôs no such thing as love deepness‚Ä¶there‚Äôs just positive affinity, and that positive affinity is coercion and manipulation, exploitation. How strong is your relationship quiz? I don‚Äôt have a relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I have a love, lust or a loser relationship? You don‚Äôt have either, because those are cultural interpretations. Sexual addiction screening test‚Ä¶ romance attachment quiz‚Ä¶ that could be interesting.‚Äù (clicking sounds)

‚ÄúOkay, this is stupid, this entire website is stupid. Feeling connected quiz? How connected in your relationship with your partner are you right now? Domestic violence screening‚Ä¶ you mean that‚Äôs not a part of a healthy relationship? Oh man‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúInterpersonal communication skills test‚Ä¶ how well do I communicate with others? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm communicating well with anyone right now. Ten second, ten questions, five minutes‚Ä¶ take the test without even reading the directions. People don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm saying, is that completely true? I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúI find it hard to express my feelings to others, completely true.‚Äù ‚ÄúI get so caught up in what I have to say that I‚Äôm not aware of the reactions of my

listeners‚Ä¶uh, I‚Äôd say completely false even though psychiatrists would say ‚Äôof course you don‚Äôt understand, you have Aspergers syndrome‚Äô \[laughter\]‚Äú

‚ÄúFour: When I know what someone is going to say I finish the sentence for him or her, that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶ well I mean, if you know what they‚Äôre going to say, you mentally do finish the sentence. And of course they‚Äôre going to say‚Ä¶ ‚Äòyou‚Äôre exhibiting Asperger qualities by being excessively pedantic and I‚Äôm going to have to prescribe this certain amount of this certain medication to cure your affliction so that you can become more like me‚Ä¶ but I do like that song‚Ä¶‚Äô Gender is such a stupid concept, I‚Äôll talk about that later.‚Äù

‚ÄúFive: If I find it difficult to express my f-‚Ä¶ I mean, heh, I find it difficult to express my opininions when others don‚Äôt share them. Well, when it results in you being involuntarily committed, I would say, true.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt understand someone‚Äôs explanation the first time around I feel stupid asking for Clarification, uh, well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really have‚Ä¶ interaction with anyone so I don‚Äôt think I could even ask someone, so I‚Äôll say no.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother problem with these tests is that they‚Äôre assuming that you‚Äôre coming from a specific background, which I am not.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven: I try to divert or end conversations that don‚Äôt interest me. Uhm, well, yes by definition I think‚Ä¶ heh.‚Äù

‚ÄúEight: I find it easy to see things from someone else‚Äôs point of view. Yes. Nine when I talk t-, and another problem with these tests is that it depends on the person‚Äôs interpretations of your questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNine: When I talk to someone I put myself in his or her shoes. Well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to answer that one.‚Äù

‚ÄúTen: I mean, I don‚Äôt want to finish this test.‚Äù (clicking sounds)

‚ÄúAnd answers, what did it say about me? 53? My communication skills are average? Fuck you!‚Äù

‚ÄúPersonality, big 5 personality test‚Ä¶ a big 5 based personality assessment that provides you personalized and detailed feedback across 45 distinct traits. Oh I‚Äôm sure those traits are distinct, you didn‚Äôt make it up at all, they‚Äôre real‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this like you? Take a little time for others and seldom interested in other‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs, oh, this whole identity thing that people have. So disgusting. I can just imagine they‚Äôre sitting at a coffee table, ‚ÄòI take a little time for others and I‚Äôm seldom interested in other people‚Äôs problems‚Äô well, they wouldn‚Äôt be saying that but‚Ä¶ heh, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm generally indifferent to the feelings of others‚Äô, no that‚Äôs the opposite of me because I have a liberal arts education.‚Äù ‚ÄúI complete tasks on time and according to plan, I usually prepare for things ahead of time to avoid making mistakes, I actually like to plan ahead. Exactly like me, you can‚Äôt get ahead in life unless you plan.‚Äù

‚ÄúI enjoy learning things and find abstract ideas interesting, I also have a rich vocabulary and show a mastery of language‚Ä¶indubitably, exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hard to get to know, intent to keep others at a distance, I reveal little about myself to others‚Ä¶well these cretins wouldn‚Äôt understand me so I‚Äôll say exactly like me, next‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI have difficulty imagining things and struggle to come up with new ide-ideas‚Ä¶well, no, that‚Äôs the complete opposite of me. I‚Äôm a very creative soul.‚Äù

‚ÄúI respect authority, oh of course I do. Where would we be without authority? ‚Ä¶and try to follow rules, I avoid taking advantage of people and respect the privacy of others, that‚Äôs exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI enjoy spending time by myself in contemplation and reflecting on things, I often prefer to be alone‚Ä¶no, I‚Äôm a people person.‚Äù

‚ÄúI try not to think about the needy and tend to dislike soft-hearted people, I tend to look down on any weakness‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not like me at all, because I have liberal values.‚Äù

‚ÄúI experience very few emotional highs and lows and I‚Äôm not disturbed by events, I‚Äôm relaxed most of the time‚Ä¶ how can you be relaxed when there‚Äôs exploitation going on in the world? I must get the government to do something about this, well I‚Äôll say opposite of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI easily resist temptations and am able to control my cravings, I rarely overindulge‚Ä¶ no I only indulge in Shakespeare, hahaha. That‚Äôs exactly like me‚Ä¶ I mean \[laughter\], I mean, I‚Äôm going, yes that‚Äôs exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe in a logical answer for everything and do things in the logical order, but there is no truth, so‚Ä¶ there is no logic, so I‚Äôll say the opposite of me, no-one is right and no-one‚Äôs wrong, we should all love each other and I‚Äôm not making a value statement by saying we should all love each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúI rarely look for a deeper meaning in things or feel the need to understand my motives‚Ä¶ okay, what would someone say about that? Someone at the coffee table, what would they say? (repeating question) But there‚Äôs a deeper meaning in everything you see, so we should go on to the next question.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on good terms with, and have a good word for nearly everyone, and I‚Äôm easy to satisfy‚Ä¶ I have a good word for everyone except for those who seek to propagate conservative values, so I‚Äôll say ‚Äòopposite of me‚Äù

‚ÄúI tend to put little time and effort into my work and I don‚Äôt pay attention and seldom notice details. That is‚Ä¶ the complete opposite of me. After all, I greatly enjoy Dostoevsky‚Äôs literature.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not easily annoyed and rarely get irritated, I‚Äôm rarely in a bad mood. Of course I‚Äôm not in a bad mood, it‚Äôs impractical to be in a bad mood, bad mood is‚Ä¶ not life-affirming, and I am life-affirming, so I‚Äôll say‚Ä¶ and the question was‚Ä¶ so that‚Äôs exactly like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI tend to deal with others in a formal manner, I seldom joke around or act wild & crazy‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôve been known to get a bit rambunctious at some parties so I‚Äôll say the opposite of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now the problem with this person at the coffee table, they‚Äôve, their mind has gotten so distorted by their enculturation that they‚Äôve suddenly become bipolar, not only bipolar but they have two split personalities. Isn‚Äôt that horrible? So now this person is going to be a raging conservative.‚Äù

‚ÄúNext question, damnit‚Ä¶\[laughter\] I‚Äôm not fond of art and literature, of course I‚Äôm not fond of art and literature, that‚Äôs what those pansies enjoy. I don‚Äôt enjoy watching dance performances or concerts, exactly like me!‚Äù

‚ÄúI try to outdo others and tend to put people under pressure. Well you have to do that because you have to exhibit your dominance because‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt exhibit your dominance, the terrorists win!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that I‚Äôm better than most others, exactly like me!‚Äù
