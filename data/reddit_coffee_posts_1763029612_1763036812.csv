I started using it last night and was already a little confused. But this morning its killing my vibe on every level. Here's what Im experiencing. Curious if anyone is experiencing the same?

1. Its formatting responses so differently and not in a good way. Responses are so direct and to the point, that there is little context. 

2. No matter how many ways I word it, it cannot generate a downloadable csv that is correct. I had it structure a board in Monday and asked for it to give me a downloadable csv for easy upload into Monday.com. It kept giving me code or text rather than the csv. When I finally got it to give me the csv, it was missing half of the columns we outlined in the chat and it wouldn't correct it no matter how many prompts I sent. PS: it has generated over 30 CSVs in this same way with gpt 5 in the last week for me, so this is a major change. 

3. I asked it if it was glitching because it was 5.1, and it literally said ""\[Name\], Stop. This isn't a 5.1 issue"".... like no this bitch did not just talk back to me, and put me in my place. lmao! But seriously... like no... I have a business to run here and I hate when it ""lies"" (says something with zero truth to it).

4. The answers it is giving me are totally wrong, even when I use it inside of a project. 

5. I keep trying to find a work around for getting my custom gpts to remember shit, so I usually add them to projects after I begin the convo, or I tag them with the @ symbol in a chat. That way they can use the context to give the right responses. But it's not working now. I can't ""tag"" a custom gpt in a project now. 

Wahhh. I love chat gpt. it's changed my life and I am a geek- I check the release notes/ change log daily to see what new updates came out literally every day... but this one is sending me! I trust it'll be fixed or working much better soon but Im frustrated this am and I ahve NOT had enough coffee for this! Anyone else?",1,1763036717.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

It's not unusual to have your morning commute rerouted because Mister Mighty is punching in a Mecha-Snake or for your favourite coffee shop to one day be replaced by a meteor containing a new alien species

> Only, a tragedy happened years ago. The supervillain Vox Terra wiped out many, many heroes during her reign, and the uptake of new heroes has significantly decreased in the years since her death. As such, the established heroes stick to punching things out in space. They don't have the time to care about the small things, the thieves lurking in the night, the bankrobbers and everyday thugs who make your lives actually difficult. Simply put, heroes have moved onto bigger and better things and left humanity in the dust.

﻿

You spot it blowing in the wind on your morning commute: *Wanted! Local Friendly Heroes To Save the neighbourhood! Coffee and snacks will be provided. Fridays at 7pm at Southside community center*

Maybe you're a down on your luck hero wanting to reconnect with the local people. Maybe you're a bright eyed newcomer prepared to make the world a better place. Maybe you're just fucking sick of going to book club and this seems like a change of pace.

Either way, it's time to see if you've got what it takes to save...A small part of the city.

﻿

Hello! I'm Poppy (he/him), and I've been playing in pbp games for about a year and a half. After trying my hand at running a few Masks games, I am now (shock horror) after having played in a few Sentinels Comics games, going to attempt a game where when the numbers determine how hard you hit someone.

This game will hopefully begin small scale. A group of plucky heroes coming together to protect a specific section of the city from villains. Think street level heroes fighting street level villains. Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hawkeye, take your pick. There will likely not be god-punching or many other awesome epic things, at least, not for the longest while, because what I really love is character and conflict. 

To me, those two things are the beating heart of a pbp game. I want drama, I want conflict, I want to see people who will try their damn hardest to be good people in the face of adversity. I want people to work with me to create a story, rather than think I am some Magical Unimpeachable Storytelling Overlord.

So, what do I ask of you?  


I need people to respect post length. If there’s a situation where someone asks a simple question, there doesn’t need to be multiple-post paragraphs. However that doesn’t meant that the twenty paragraph posts for when you defeat your evil Super-Dad aren’t needed. No, you simply respect the length, be it good or long. The quality matters over quantity.

There will be a requirement of a post a day, and usage of tupperbot is mandatory. Don't be put off by no knowledge of the system, newcomers are encouraged. I am looking for 5 players, and complicated characters are also a bonus, with messy complicated lives and wants for being a hero.

As a player, you must:

* Be able to post at least once a day, unless clearly communicating otherwise. 
* Not give much of a crap about ‘winning’, but give a crap about telling a compelling, exciting story. 
* Willing to play people with differing perspectives all in the name of drama: to understand you are not your character and will have differing viewpoints on the world
* Willing to take initiative, instead of waiting for commands from god.
* Willing to haggle and workshop if needed.
* Understanding of the fact, that the GM is another player, and has as much power as you.
* Willing to invest in other player's characters.
* Use Tupperbox. If you don't know what that is then-
* Willing to learn how to use Tupperbox.
* Understand rule of cool beats rule of nerds and fools

My analysis aims to find a gap in the market = lots of respondents said they prefer this coffee but it's not on the market, or vice-versa not enough preferred this coffee but it's on the market a lot.

For example, I have this data (list shortened for purpose of this question):

Latte: market = 25, preference based on questionnaire =112

Cappuccino: market = 7, preference = 138

Macchiato: market = 5, preference = 12

Espresso: market = 0, preference = 55

  
Note: the market was calculated based od 71 products on the market and the preference was calculated based on 240 answers to the questionnare, where they could choose multiple answers (I'm not sure if this is relevant but just in case it is :))

ChatGPT told me to use **Chi-square analysis** and **standardised residuals**, but I am struggling to understand it based on the things I've read and I am not sure if it's the right way to do it, so I would really appreaciate a humans help! :))

He’s brilliant, athletic, effortlessly popular — and cruel in that quiet, practiced way of someone who never needs to raise his voice.

By the next morning, the “new girl who talked back to Ian Blake” has become a ghost. His influence is absolute; laughter fades when you enter, and every glance that slides past you burns colder than the last.  
  
Three nights later, while retrieving a lost bag, you hear a low, animal snarl behind the gym.Under the silver light stands Ian — half-human, half-wolf — trembling, torn between pain and rage. For a heartbeat, his perfect mask shatters: the school’s golden boy, undone by something feral beneath his skin.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

1ovzgml,https://www.reddit.com/r/traders_colony/comments/1ovzgml/seeking_final_end_of_all_knowledges/,seeking final end of all knowledges,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ovzf0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1ovzf0p/starting_solids_with_twins_routine_best_practice/,Starting solids with twins - routine best practice advice needed,"Hi mums, hoping to gather some maternal wisdom here. I have posted this in the subreddit /parentsofmultiples also, but figured there is knowledge to be had from this community also.

We are first time parents to twins, two girls, 8 almost 9 months old, approx 7mo adjusted. No other kids in the household.
We have started introducing solids a few months back, mostly a taste here and there of what we're eating but have amped up with purees and some toast strips and eggs for BLW. They are loving food and are very interested in general. My issue is getting a good routine in terms how to be as efficient as possible with feeding and then cleaning them and the surroundings afterwards. 

The reason I need an efficient routine is this:
My husband has been at home with me this entire time but will be relocating in January for work, and we will join him once things are setup. I'll be taking care of the girls by myself during that time with very limited/no family support, in addition to planning this move. They are very happy but needy girls and I am dreading doing this on my own as we currently have a great division of labour going. Therefore I need all your best advice on how to make life as simple as possible while still making sure I give them what they need. Right now things just get so messy and clean up takes forever and then they start crying because they're still hungry and I haven't brought them the bottle quick enough... 

These are our circumstances/current setup:
We don't live in the US, we live in Sweden. We live small; 1 bedroom 1 living room and a separate small kitchen, no open floor plan. Bathroom is tiny, only fits a corner shower, a toilet, a sink, and a cupboard, no bathtub.
Most of the baby stuff is in the living room, including the change table and baby tub that we fill up using a big kitchen bowl. 
We have the Baby Brezza both formula and bottle washer machines, they run hot in this household.
We have two ANTILOP high chairs from IKEA with added foot rests and back pillows. These can fit in either living room or kitchen. 

They are currently on a 3 nap/day schedule, but might be moving to 2/day soon, cutting out the last nap. We use the app Huckleberry to track and plan. Our current schedule is like this, approximately: 
6am: wake up
<1st wake window>
8am - 9.30am: first nap
<2nd wake window>
12pm - 1.30pm: second nap
<3rd wake window>
4pm - 4.30pm: third nap, sometimes in pram
<4th wake window, and last one>
7.30pm bedtime
<night sleep>

1st wake window i take partially by myself as husband needs another hour before he's human. First thing I do is change their diapers. They are hungry within 30 min of waking. The kitchen needs a reset: reload the bottle washer, pre boil new water for formula machine, and coffee for me. 

Usually we will try and squeeze a walk in during either the 2nd or 3rd wake window, sometimes in conjunction with the last nap. Otherwise it's play time in the pen or entertainment station.
We feed them a bottle before naps/bedtime because it helps them zoink out. 

Bath time is in the last wake window, but not every night, most nights they get a wipe down and a fresh outfit. 

Today I gave it a go with putting them in the kitchen during our 1st wake window while resetting and preparing some breakfast for us. They had a mix of BLW toast and spoon fed puree. After they were sticky from head to toe. I ended up giving them a shallow bath, one at a time, with the other in a baby björn bouncer while waiting. They both got really cranky and were still hungry and I had to rush bathing sticky babies while my husband got up and made bottles for them. Their clothes were super messy despite bibs, so new outfits were needed already. Overall pretty stressful and not a very relaxing way to start the morning. 

Is there a life hack that saved you? Anything unconventional that you swear by? I just dont understand how I'm supposed to do this 2-3 times a day eventually, we will never not be cranky and sticky!

I make my daughters snack homemade but recipes still call for sugar. 
Our bread recipe uses 1/4 cups for a large loaf or two normal loaves. 
I made homemade granola with maple syrup. Usually 1/4 cup makes about 6-8 cups of granola - lasts 4-6 weeks. She might eat 1/4 with homemade yogurt as a snack. 
Our homemade granola bars use honey and sugar and once cut have about 4g of sugar in them, but contain oodles of healthy seeds etc. 
My muffin mix usues about 1/2 cup for the full recipes - i make maybe 2.5 mini muffins or a dozen+ regular muffins. 

I personally have a sweet tooth but migrated to a sugar free syrup for my coffee that I make with 2 cups of water and 1/4 tsp of surcalose. 

When people go sugar free do they cut everything - peanut butter, honey, maple syrup? Or is it mostly processed sugars etc. 
We rarely have juice in the house unless it is my homemade cranberry juice. Maybe 1-2L a month. 

Not sure where to start as I love baking and making homemade snacks but most homemade things call for some form of sugar.

## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS



#### SEC Filing Analysis: BRC Inc. (BRCC)

#### Executive Summary

- **Trading Significance**: Medium
- **Key Takeaway**: BRC Inc. filed an 8-K with an investor presentation outlining its 2025 financial guidance and 3-year targets, signaling modest revenue growth but highlighting significant margin headwinds from inflation and investments.
- **Market Impact**: The disclosure provides transparency into management's expectations and strategic priorities, likely leading to analyst model adjustments. The impact is considered neutral as the guidance points to minimal growth and acknowledges challenges.

#### Company Information

| Industry | Beverages |

#### Insider Information

This Form 8-K is a corporate disclosure and does not report a specific insider transaction. Therefore, insider details are not applicable.

#### Transaction Details

This filing is not a report of a securities transaction. It is a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 7.01, Regulation FD Disclosure, related to the furnishing of an investor presentation.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Form Type | 8-K |

#### Financial Impact Assessment

As this is not a transaction filing, materiality calculations based on a trade are not applicable. The analysis focuses on the implications of the disclosed corporate information.

#### Impact Evaluation

- **Market Cap Context**: With a market cap of $140 million, BRC Inc. is a small-cap company. The provided guidance and strategic updates are critical for investor assessment of its growth trajectory.
- **Guidance Analysis**: The 2025 revenue guidance of 'at least $395M' represents minimal growth over 2024's actual revenue of $391M. The Adjusted EBITDA guidance of 'at least $20M' indicates continued investment and margin pressure.
- **Strategic Shift**: The presentation emphasizes a significant business evolution from a Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) model (71% of revenue in 2021) to a wholesale-driven one (62% of revenue in 2024), which has different margin and growth profiles.

#### Market Impact Analysis

#### Stock Impact Prediction

- **Direction**: Neutral
- **Reasoning**: The filing provides a mixed outlook. While the company is executing a strategic pivot and launching new products (Energy drinks), the financial guidance for 2025 suggests a period of stabilization rather than high growth. Acknowledged headwinds like coffee inflation and tariffs may temper investor enthusiasm.

#### Volume & Sentiment

- **Expected Volume Impact**: May see a near-term increase in trading volume as the market digests the new guidance and 3-year targets.
- **Sentiment Indicator**: Neutral. The presentation confirms the company's strategic direction but also quantifies significant cost challenges that are expected to compress margins.

#### Investment Insights

#### Positive Market Indicators

- **Wholesale Expansion**: Continued growth in All Commodity Volume (ACV) and deepening penetration with major retailers like Walmart.
- **New Category Entry**: The launch of the Black Rifle Energy drink line opens up a new $23B market category for the company.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Management highlights cost-saving initiatives, including headcount reduction and SG&A savings, aimed at improving long-term profitability.

#### Risk Factors

- **Margin Compression**: The company explicitly calls out over $30M in headwinds for 2025 from green coffee costs, trade promotions, loyalty programs, and tariffs.
- **DTC Channel Stabilization**: The original core of the business, the DTC channel, is now in a stabilization phase, shifting the growth burden to the wholesale channel.
- **Execution Risk**: The success of the 3-year plan hinges on scaling the new energy drink, expanding wholesale without further margin erosion, and achieving supply chain efficiencies.

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Transition Year**: 2025 is positioned as a year of modest growth, heavy investment in the energy drink launch, and absorption of significant commodity-driven cost pressures.
2. **Wholesale is Key**: The company's future is heavily tied to the success of its wholesale channel, which now constitutes the majority of its revenue.
3. **Long-Term Targets**: Management has set a 10-15% revenue CAGR target through 2027, with a goal of reaching 40%+ gross margins, indicating a belief that current headwinds are temporary.

#### Additional Context

#### Filing Notes

- **Purpose**: The presentation is for a 'non-deal roadshow,' a common practice for companies to communicate their story and strategy to the investment community outside of a capital-raising event.
- **Forward-Looking Statements**: The document contains significant forward-looking guidance, providing a benchmark against which the company's performance will be measured in upcoming quarters.

I’m throwing this out there because I’m genuinely curious if others feel the same.

I’ve been in Luxembourg for a while now, and I keep bumping into the same wall: friendships here often feel kinda… shallow? Transactional? Like from day one you have to “bring something to the table” — pet sitting, baby sitting, doing tiny favors just to be allowed in the circle. And conversations rarely go deeper than weather, prices, and “wow, supermarkets close early.”

Don’t get me wrong — I love Luxembourg and that’s why I wish to have real friends here. I’m also lucky that my partner is my best friend, my human metal-concert buddy. But! it would be nice to have a few friendships outside the relationship that don’t feel like LinkedIn networking with coffee.

Making friends was never a challenge for me except here. I’ve tried joining activities, going to metal, rock and generally music shows, start a small chat in the bars, small events, meetups… but people always seem to already be in tight groups (usually from the same country originally). And the few friendships I did manage to form? They ended when people inevitably left Luxembourg. Luxembourg City is like the hometown of temporary humans, even though I love its vibes and calmness deeply and can’t see myself living somewhere else. But I miss those times hanging out with friends discussing random stuff from music to books to weird thoughts about life. 

Is anyone else in the same boat?
How did you meet people who actually want to form real connections that aren’t transactional or short-term?
Any activities or communities that worked for you?

It's super simple. I just send a casual chat like ""coffee $5"" or ""gas 40"". The Gemini AI understands the natural language, converts the number, auto-fills my GSheet, and my live Dashboard updates instantly.

I knew they’d be posh, or they couldn’t afford a nanny in the first place. But they have fancy agencies for that sort of thing now; someone with this sort of money doesn’t need to advertise on a Facebook group. I fold the cuff of my cardigan over, so that the ripped hem doesn’t show, and deposit the half-drunk Greggs takeaway latte in the neighbours’ wheelie bin. I should have splurged for a Starbucks. It might have distracted from my grown-out roots and chipped nail varnish. 

Mum insisted I start looking for work. I finished college 8 months ago. It was a struggle by the end, but Mum had insisted that after the debacle that was high school, by hell or high water I was going to get my certificate. And hell it was. In the peace that followed the chaos and stress that got me my qualification, I went into freefall. I stopped going out. Stopped washing. Stopped eating. I lost contact with the few friends who hadn’t gone off to uni and spent 8 months of my life watching the 24 hour Come Dine With Me channel on Mum’s smart TV. Finally, Mum had put her foot down. I needed to pay rent. Nana’s inheritance was nearly gone, and Mum wanted to put the rest of it towards Natasha’s pregnancy. Benefits were out of the question; Mum was mortified at the idea of the neighbours seeing DWP envelopes sticking out of our post slot. I wasn’t convinced that anyone but Mum paid that much attention to other people’s business on the estate, but she was determined to never come across as ‘pikey’. 

I grew up on an estate. Housing provided by the council, which was Mum’s greatest shame. When Nana died, Mum had been given a sizable inheritance. No one had known how much Nana had packed into a tear in her mattress, but Grandad had apparently been far richer than he let on. Mum told everyone Nana didn’t trust the banks, or that she had a hoarding problem from growing up in the Blitz. I suspect the truth was that the Department of Work and Pensions were unlikely to investigate her mattress. Mum used the money to move us further out of London, to an ex-council house she was able to buy outright. It was the only ex-council property on the estate, and Mum wore that like a badge of honour. Tash had taken to our new home instantly, decorating her room with half of B&M and almost instantly finding a job at a beautician’s clinic in the gentrified part of town. In no time, she was able to move into her own place, sharing with the new boyfriend she’d met at work, and my little sister was an engaged, pregnant aesthetician-in-training. I, on the other hand, got my GCSEs four years late and barely made it through a childcare course.

I hadn’t expected to get the job. Mum had gotten suspicious of the way I cradled my phone to my chest whenever she asked about my job applications, and had finally sat me down in front of her laptop and watched me apply for several babysitting jobs until she was satisfied. She’d been especially invested in this one for the prestige of the ‘nanny’ title, and I’d spent a gruelling hour and half fine-tuning my cover letter with her until she agreed that it was perfect. Tash’s future baby became a living, breathing infant that I had spent the last 8 months caring for, with Tash prematurely taking on her fiance’s surname so that the reference seemed impartial. I hadn’t expected it to fool anyone; especially with the flowery language Mum had insisted on (I liked kids, but calling them ‘the most valuable and precious gift we have’ in a job application seemed a bit much), but sure enough, I received a reply a week later. I’d already confirmed another job, just a few school pick-ups a week for a woman on the estate who had left a flyer on the community board, but Mum made me cancel. The wage that was quoted in the Facebook post was not worth sacrificing for the scraps of Debbie’s giro, she’d said. 

So, here I am; barely able to care for myself, being interviewed to keep another tiny, fragile human warm and fed. Hoping that my outfit was bought too long ago to be recognised as Primark, I take a deep breath and knock. It’s a proper brass ring doorknocker, and it makes an impressive, resonant rap on the solid, varnished wood of the door. I wait. And wait. I wrestle with the choice of knocking again and risking seeming impatient, or continuing to wait for someone to answer a knock they hadn’t heard. Eventually, I remember that I didn’t want this job in the first place, and am about to head to the Starbucks to camp out until I can return home and tell Mum that they’d wanted someone with more experience, when the door opens. 

She’s not much older than I am; even the heavy bags under her eyes can’t mask her youth. She peers at me from below an unwashed blonde fringe, her bare face smattered with freckles. Pretty, but exhausted. 

I plaster a smile on my face, and she asks, ‘Are you Abby?’ 

‘Yes- I’m Abigail, nice to meet you.’ I’d been given strict instructions to use my full name. As if nicknames were too common for rich folk. 

‘Come in.’ Her voice is flat, and she turns away to walk into the house. I ignore Mum’s rule about not entering until I’m invited, and hurry after her, closing the front door behind me. 

The house is a mess. Not the same sort of mess you find on a council estate; piled up newspapers dating back to the 60s in the home of the pensioner who’d died in his flat, or the carpets stained with dog shit from the couple running a puppy mill in their smoke-stained semi-detached. But certainly not the hoover lines and carefully placed trinkets of my mother’s house. Mum would have complimented her on her beautiful house, only to shoot me a look that said ‘I guess money *can’t* buy class’ as soon as her back was turned. There are piles of laundry scattered about like landmines, crumbs on every surface, and half-drunk cups of tea that must account for the faint wafts of mold that my nose keeps catching.

‘Sorry about the mess.’ she says apologetically, and I raise my eyebrows as if surprised that she’d felt the need to mention it. ‘I’m a first-time mum. Apparently it’s normal.’ She speaks in short bursts, like even connecting her thoughts is too much effort. 

‘I understand- of course. Not that it’s bad; it’s fine! It’s a lovely home.’ I add hurriedly, and hope that she takes my stammering attempt at defusing the awkwardness in good faith. 

She doesn’t even seem to notice. 

‘Her dad decided he didn’t want kids after all, just after she was born. I wasn’t planning on being a single mum.’ There’s a melancholy in her voice, which hangs in the air around us. Honestly, I’m a little shocked at her candour. Mum says oversharing is dreadfully common, but there’s nothing common about a house this size, in this part of town. I guess the more unfavourable parts of your history become quirky and romantically tragic when you’re rich. She wouldn’t have let me step foot in the door if she knew some of the skeletons in *my* closet. 

‘I’m sorry.’ I say, unsure of what else would be appropriate. Anna blinks, seemingly snapping herself out of her daze. 

‘No, *I’m* sorry.’ she says, her voice a little clearer now. ‘I’ve not slept enough. It feels like I’m going mad most days.’ She takes a deep breath. ‘Let’s start again. I’m Anna.’

She holds a hand out to me, and I take it, shaking it limply. ‘Abigail.’ I murmur. She seems crackers. And I’d know. 

‘Abigail.’ she repeats, a warm, practiced smile spreading over her face. ‘Abigail, as you can see, I need some help.’ 

‘Yes.’ I say, without thinking. ‘I mean- no, that’s not what I meant.’ 

Anna chuckles. ‘I’m not offended. Obviously, I need help, that’s why I posted the advert. Do you have much experience with babies?’ 

Loaded question. ‘Some. My qualification is fairly recent, but I’ve been taking care of babies since my sister was born.’ It’s not a lie; I helped Mum change Tash’s nappy at least twice when she was little, and I babysat for the neighbours a few times after I dropped out of school. Anna doesn’t need to know that my experience amounts to ‘enthusiastic amateur’ (although, ‘enthusiastic’ might be a stretch). 

‘Do you like babies?’ Anna asks. I’ve practiced this question with Mum enough times. 

‘I *love* babies. Before my little sister, I used to dress up my Nan’s old dog in a bonnet and push her around in a doll pram.’ We laugh at this adorable, fabricated story. Bitsy was a shit of a dog, and I’d have lost a finger if I’d tried dressing her up. 

‘I always wanted to be a mum.’ Anna says, dreamily. ‘I didn’t think it would happen so soon, but nature took its course, and I decided I didn’t want to wait.’  

*How lovely to have the option* I think, bitterly. I clench my teeth, as if biting back that nasty, unwarranted thought. Anna seems so sweet, and my family baggage isn’t her fault. 

‘Do you live here alone?’ I ask, though I’ve not seen any evidence of another adult. I can’t imagine what she does to afford living here without a housemate. 

‘Just me and Ruthie.’ Anna confirms. ‘Her Dad and I moved in a few years ago. If it were up to me, we’d have bought somewhere more remote. If it was up to him, we’d have been slap-bang in the middle of the city. This was our compromise.’ she smiles sadly. ‘I guess I should have insisted.’ 

‘So, you own it?’ I ask. I’m still so curious about her circumstances. 

Anna blushes a bit, avoiding my eyes. ‘I’ve been very privileged.’ she says, evasively. 

Ah. Family money. 

‘Shall we head upstairs? You can meet her.’ Anna suggests, clearly eager to change the subject.

I follow Anna up a carpeted staircase, noting the dust and hair gathered in the crevasses of the steps, the slight stickiness on certain points of the banister. From my experience, people in houses like this either get a cleaner in twice a week and keep it like a museum, or they stuff it to the rafters with crap in some vague attempt to feel down-to-earth and worldly. Anna seems to be a rare anomaly; Not regimented enough for column A, but nowhere near column B. Yet. I suppose single-motherhood will decide it for her. 

The nursery is clearly Anna’s main focus - a sparkling white tooth in a mouth full of cavities. Pristine, tidy, and decorated in soft muted pastels. Soft classical music floats out of a high-end speaker, barely loud enough to discern. Anna, too, changes; her harried exhaustion turned to a blissful languidness. She drifts over to the painted wood crib, old-fashioned but clearly safeguarded for modern sleeping standards. 

‘Good morning, sweet Ruthie.’ Anna sings, reaching her arm into the crib. She smiles at some unseen reaction, and beckons me over, not taking her eyes off her daughter. 

‘I want you to meet Abby- sorry, Abigail.’ She shoots an apologetic glance at me, before turning her attention back to Ruth. Eager to see the baby now, I step forward and lean to see over the crib’s edge. 

I feel the smile slowly fall off my face as I try to comprehend what I’m seeing. In the crib, lying on a mattress with a soft, pink sheet, is a plastic baby doll. Large, painted eyes staring permanently into space, plastic fingers curled into loose fists. 

It’s a joke. Any second now, she’ll straighten up, sneer at me for thinking I could ever work for someone like her, then laugh me out of the house. Maybe point out a hidden camera that had captured the realisation on my face. I wait. Anna doesn’t laugh, and when I glance over at her, she’s still smiling beatifically at the plastic facsimile of her daughter. 

‘I can’t believe she’s mine.’ Anna whispers, her voice thick with emotion. ‘Why didn’t your Daddy want to be in your life, eh? Stupid Daddy.’ 

She straightens up then, squeezes her knuckle to a rapidly forming tear in her left eye. ‘Sorry, I’m just being silly. She’s due for a feed, wait here with her while I get her bottle.’

I wait for her to leave the room, then go back to the crib and stare at the fake Ruthie. She’s dressed in a onesie - lilac with puppies frozen in various dancing positions. 

There had been a girl on my childcare course like this - overweight and soft spoken, she brought in a silicone baby doll on her first day. She’d sit in the front row, rocking the thing with one arm while she took notes with the other, steadfastly ignoring the whispers and giggles and stares. She hadn’t made it through the second week - she didn’t turn up on the next Wednesday, and we never saw her again. I hadn’t been very kind to her, something I regretted greatly when I started researching reborn dolls, and the way they were used for dementia patients, grieving mothers and traumatised children. I had an idea of which category Anna fell into, but was again surprised by the thriftiness of her choice of doll. Most people paid into the thousands to get the most realistic, hand-painted doll they could find. Real hair, not molded plastic, and articulated limbs that could be manoeuvered into any position an actual baby could make, instead of the rigid, bent elbows of Anna’s baby. She looks like the sort of doll you could buy at Toys R Us. I’d have thought that someone of Anna’s standing could at least afford something from Hamleys.

Fascinated, I reach a hand into the crib, plucking at the fabric of the onesie. This, at least, feels like good quality; soft, warm cotton. I pass my hand over the doll’s face, as if I can snap the toy out of its inanimate state. The eyes continue to stare into space. Some impulsion grabs me, and I poke my finger into one of the painted pupils. 

‘Like clockwork!’ Anna says behind me, bustling into the room. I jump, snatching my hand back guiltily. Poking babies in the eyes, real or fake, is unlikely to secure me the job. ‘If I’m even a minute late for her feed, she screams the house down!’

She hurries over to the crib, bottle in hand, placing her hand on the chest of the toy as if soothing it. I watch, feeling awkward. 

‘There, now.’ she intones in her soft, sing-song voice. ‘Mummy’s got your milky.’ 

I cringe at that. What is this? Is it a fetish thing? She’s not the usual demographic of pervert you’d expect. But maybe that’s stereotyping; maybe perverts can be young, pretty, middle-class women, too. Or maybe she’s just batty, like the girl on my course. I watch as she lifts ‘Ruthie’ out of the crib with such care, such love. I guess crazy’s better than sexual.

‘She’s a hungry girl.’ she says, tipping the bottle to the doll’s mouth. For a few seconds, she just stands there, bottle in hand, staring adoringly down into the plastic baby in her arms. Then, shushing placatingly, she pulls the bottle away and holds it out to me.

‘Do you want to try?’ she asks. I think about saying no, about making some polite excuse, then getting the hell out of there. But then, how hard can it be to look after a fake baby? Surely not as hard as looking after a real one. If I can keep Anna sweet, this could be an easier scam than Nana’s pension. 

‘I’d love to.’ I say, smiling warmly. I take the bottle, and let her gently transfer the doll into my arms. She’s heavy for a doll - probably weighted for realism. Summoning all of my physical improv skills, I guide the nipple of the bottle to the doll’s mouth. On instinct, I squeeze the bottle ever-so-slightly, and milk runs into the channel of its plastic lips and dribbles down its face.

Instantly, Anna swoops in, plucking her baby out of my arms.

‘Oh, not too much! Like I said, she’s a good feeder, so she’ll get enough by herself.’

I don’t know why I’m so embarrassed. I’m not the freak giving a Baby Born real milk. I wonder if it’s real breast milk. Surely not, right? But if she lost the real Ruthie, like I suspect she did, then all that milk has to go somewhere. I surreptitiously wipe a few droplets of milk off my hand with my cardigan, and make a mental note to wash it as soon as I can. 

‘You don’t mind if I change her, do you?’ she asks, once she’s finished with her little play-pretend feeding. 

‘Of course not.’ I say, faintly. How much weirder is this going to get? Anna has a whole changing station; beautifully engraved, varnished wood, probably Victorian. 6-year old me would be green with envy - It’s like she has a life-sized dollhouse. Ruthie looks even more fake and plastic against the antique wood. 

‘Stinky girl.’ Anna coos, kissing the doll’s tummy and twiddling its feet. I watch as she gathers everything from the drawers under the changing table - wipes, baby powder, a fresh flannel and a small box of nappy pins. 

‘Have you ever changed a cloth nappy?’ Anna asks. 

It was part of my childcare course, but I don’t want to risk embarrassing myself like I did with the bottle, so I say,

‘My last job thought disposable nappies were more hygienic.’ 

Anna rolls her eyes and chuckles. ‘That’s crazy. Reusable nappies are so much better, for baby and for the environment. Watch me.’ 

Hesitantly, I step towards her. She’s not just going through the motions; she’s fully committed to the act. She sings to Ruthie, walking her fingers down the plastic torso and carefully undoing the nappy pin. She unfolds the nappy, and I gasp, stepping back.

Anna laughs, folding the nappy in on itself. ‘Apparently, we Mums have weird hormones that make us think it smells delicious and buttery. I forget it must smell like death to everyone else.’

I don’t know how I didn’t smell it before. The nappy is full - not of plastic or paint or some other sort of faked substance, but of human excrement. It must have been in there the whole time, even when she was briefly in my arms. How I hadn’t smelled the fetid mess when it was literally under my nose, I’m not sure.

Unfazed, Anna drops the dirty nappy in a small, lidded basket by her feet, and continues her task.

‘The boil wash only takes an hour, and I usually put them on once a day. I wouldn’t leave it more than that, they pile up quickly. Just make sure you don’t put anything else in with them.’

I think, then, about Anna wiping herself with the cloth and pinning the messy nappy onto her fake daughter, multiple times a day. I feel sick. 

‘Where’s your loo?’ I ask, hurriedly. Mum would be mortified to hear me call it a ‘loo’ instead of a ‘WC’ or whatever other ridiculous genteel name she’d want me to use, but at this point, I risk dry-heaving if I open my mouth to correct myself. 

‘Down the hall,’ Anna says, pointing, a coy smile playing at the corner of her lips. I walk out, trying not to look too much like I’m dashing for it. Anna’s laughter echoes after me.

‘You’ll get used to it, I swear!’

\-

I’m not sick, thankfully, but the lavender scent of the bleach is giving me a bit of a headache. Anna must have done a quick clean of the toilet before I arrived, as the bottle is still perched on the cistern. I didn’t know rich people had a fancy alternative to Toilet Duck. I take a quick drink out of the tap, splashing some cold water on my wrists so that I don’t ruin my makeup. I look at myself in the mirror. I’d thought I looked quite nice when I left the house, but compared to Anna, even in her tired, unwashed state, I do just look a bit…cheap. My cardigan *does* look ratty; Mum was right. 

Still, maybe that’s my appeal. An agency nanny would have reported her right away. Whether this is genuine delusion, or just wanting someone to play along, some chavvy girl from Facebook is more likely to suck it up for the money than an actual professional. 

I can do this. 13 days, the advert said. Not even a fortnight. 13 days on my own; free from Mum, free from responsibility. Just me and a fake, shit-covered baby with a huge house to ourselves. 

When I step out, I’m a new Abby. *This* is Abigail, the confident, reassuring amateur nanny who fields questions and coos at Anna’s baby like she’s been doing this for years. *Period cramps*, I say to explain away my hesitance from earlier, and the badly-covered nausea. *I only get them for a day or two, but they’re murder every time!* Anna, pleasantly surprised at my complete about-face, nods sympathetically. Hers were awful up until she got pregnant, so she knows my pain. 

We spend the better part of an hour just chatting away - abandoning instructions mid-way to go on some unrelated tangent. I get the feeling we’re both a bit starved of connection with women our own age.

By the time I’m on her doorstep, waving back as Anna waggles Ruthie’s crooked arm up and down, we’ve abandoned the pretense of *if* I’m chosen for the job altogether. I have the dates blocked out on my calendar, and an invitation to stay the night before, so I don’t have to brave the traffic of the morning commute. I leave feeling *good,* truly good. I have a job. I have prospects. 

The shock on Mum’s face when I tell her I got it is too satisfying to be hurtful. 

\-

I’m back on Anna’s doorstep a week later. The childcare course was pretty much redundant by the time Mum had seen me off; my door nearly swung off its hinges with how much she kept coming in to remind me of some piece of common sense I was surely too stupid to know. 

Anna welcomes me warmly, but she looks even more tired than I remember. I expected that we might stay up a little while, maybe nurture the sparks of friendship I felt at my interview. But Anna announces an early night as soon as she’s taken me through the general housekeeping and reminded me of my duties. I’m a little deflated, but mostly hungry. It’s only 8pm, and I’d thought she might make dinner, or at least order something in. But I forgot that rich people are on different time - she must have eaten early, and I don’t mention that I haven’t, in case it’s considered uncouth. 

I ‘feed’ Ruthie her evening bottle while Anna gets ready for bed. The plastic eyes are a little unnerving, but she’s not quite as uncanny valley as she felt when I first saw her. I suppose now the shock has subsided, she feels more like a toy, and less like she might be haunted. 

Later, when I’ve retreated to my temporary bedroom, I find half a sleeve of Polo mints in the front pocket of my rucksack; so that’s dinner sorted.

\-

I sleep well on Anna’s expensive spare mattress. It’s amazing how it affects your quality of sleep when you’re not on second-hand box springs. Refreshed, I get up to do a quick blitz of the house. I should do *something* while I’m here. I’ve always hated Mum’s weekend ‘spring cleans’, but without her over my shoulder every step of the way, it’s quite relaxing doing the tidying. If only Mum didn’t think cleaning for money was skivvy work, I’d probably be better suited to that than childcare. 

Anna’s already gone, a half-drunk coffee and some crumbs by the sink, evidence of a last-minute dash out of the house. I find a note scrawled on the back of a receipt on the hallway table while I’m hoovering. Her phone number, and the closest A&E. Better than nothing, I suppose. 

By 11am, all the laundry piles have been consolidated, sorted, and are either in the machine or waiting in a nearby basket. Thankfully, the nappy wash has already been done, the cloths drying on the line outside. I’ve washed the couple of dirty dishes in the sink, and put away what was in the dishwasher. Hoovering done, all spills wiped up. The house is hardly spotless, but it’s neat and tidy in a way that I’m sure Anna will appreciate coming home to. There’s just one rather big task left to do.

I decide to commit to caring for Ruthie properly. Anna might be sick, but it’s clear she loves her ‘daughter’, and is paying me a lot of money to be here. The least I can do is play along. It’ll be good practice, if nothing else. 

Putting on my game face, I tiptoe into the nursery. 

‘Rise and shine!’ I say cheerily, opening the gauzy curtains above the crib. Warm morning light bathes Ruthie in an ethereal glow, and for a moment, she almost looks like a real baby. I stroke my knuckle down her cheek, and it’s soft. I pick her up, carefully supporting her head, and carry her over to the changing table. I check her nappy with some trepidation, but it’s clean, of course. I refasten the nappy pin, and leave it at that. 

I spend some time going through the miniature wardrobe that Anna has curated. The doll is better dressed than I am, but then I can’t afford to buy Monsoon, in baby or adult sizes. I spend a few minutes agonising over what to put her in - there are so many cute little outfits, and I’m tempted to try them all on her. Then, inspiration strikes. Anna will want photos, of course. My options are either to pick out a new outfit every day, and stage some activity with my plastic ward; or, I can get it all out of the way now. Stock up, so to speak. Plus, I’ll be getting paid to play dress up with a baby doll. 

I’d never had a lot of dolls as a kid, but I loved dressing up my Barbies with whatever clothes I’d found at the car boot sale that weekend. I learnt to sew so that I could make little dresses for them out of my old socks - shapeless sacks that had seemed like fashionable mini-dresses to my nine-year-old eyes. But this is a lot more fun. 

I work my way through Ruthie’s wardrobe. I start with pyjamas - easy enough to shoot; I arrange her in her crib, changing her position slightly each time. All of them sleep-safe, just in case. The light is even on a dimmer switch, so I have a nice selection of nap photos, bedtime photos and waking-up photos. Now for the real fun.

I catch myself singing to Ruthie as I dress her up; little nonsense rhymes that my Nan had sung to me, from some unknown origin. Elephants joining the circus and singing puppies and the like. Maybe I should go work in one of those baby photo studios instead of babysitting. All the dressing up and cute smiles, and none of the mess. 

However tiny the clothes are, it’s still time-consuming work. My fingers seem unusually clumsy fumbling with the tiny buttons. I’d have as hard a time dressing a real baby; it’s almost like the doll is evading me, squirming around in my grasp. But, I manage, and have an enjoyable afternoon staging my photoshoot around the house. Ruthie naps in my arms while I sit on the couch. She has tummy time with her soft toys. I even get a shot of her in her little baby bath, a miniature rubber duck tucked into her hand. Satisfied that I have enough photos to last the two weeks, I dry her plastic body off with a little pink towel, and go to find her one more outfit.

In the end, I decide on a black and white striped dungaree dress with a red love heart embroidered on the front. I stand Ruthie up in her finished outfit; making her do a little dance to show off her neat white socks and patent shoes. 

‘Let’s go for a walk.’ I tell her, the idea hitting me suddenly. I should get at least one picture of her outside. You wouldn’t leave a real baby cooped up inside for an entire fortnight; and for all intents and purposes, Ruthie is a real baby to Anna. 

I leave Ruthie on the floor of the nursery, even putting a little toy mouse next to her, like she might be bored otherwise, and creep into Anna’s bedroom. It’s my second time in there this morning, as I’d made her bed already. Still, I feel a little anxious in her room, like I’m not supposed to be there. But, if I’m here already, why not have a snoop? I open drawers and read book covers, careful not to leave any trace of my nosiness. Apart from the pair of pyjamas and couple of cardigans I picked up off the floor, her room seems surprisingly barren of clothes. She can’t have taken them all with her, and considering the size of Ruthie’s wardrobe, I can’t imagine Anna’s wearing the same few outfits over and over. It’s as I’m pondering this that I open the cupboard hidden behind her door, and answer my own question.

There’s a whole walk-in closet. Shelves of shoes like she’s in *Sex and The City*, and rails of beaded taffeta and soft cashmere, jewel-toned velvet and beige linens. I channel my inner *Vogue* editor and sort through the designer labels. 

I wonder if I’d have needed to be sectioned in the first place if I’d just had the money to be eccentric.

In the end, I can’t quite bring myself to go full Carrie Bradshaw, and Anna’s smaller than I am anyway; but I take a belt with a Chanel buckle, a Steve Madden handbag, and the iconic Ralph Lauren American flag jumper that must be too big on her. I get dressed, careful not to snag or stretch the jumper, and look at myself in Anna’s full-length closet mirror. The belt makes my jeans look expensive, and even my messy updo looks chic and effortless paired with my expensive accessories. I feel transformed, and I swan through the house like I own the place. I scoop Ruthie up from the nursery floor, and place her in the huge, fancy black pram by the front door. 

I’m so consumed in my little game of make-believe, that I don’t realise what I’m doing until I’m halfway down the road, half-a-dozen pictures snapped on my phone. I’m wearing stolen clothes and photographing a pram with a fake baby in it. These are not the actions of a young woman who is sane and thriving. I put my phone in my back pocket and grip the handle of the pram, trying not to give the game away, but I catch sight of myself in the reflection of a cafe window. I don’t look mad, I assure myself. I look like a normal woman taking her baby out for a walk. *I’m* not the one who thinks she’s real. A couple come out of the cafe, and the man holds the door open for me, flattening himself to the side to make room for the pram. 

*Go for it*. 

‘Thank you.’ I say, carefully pronouncing every letter, and push the pram inside. 

I order a coffee, and the barista smiles at me as she steams the milk.

‘How old?’ she asks, nodding at the pram. 

‘Three months.’ I say, without even thinking. The barista’s eyebrows raise, impressed.

‘Wow, you look incredible for having given birth three months ago!’ 

I think about going along with it, praising some mystery personal trainer for getting me back to my pre-baby weight in record time, but this is not my world, and I don’t want to get caught out. 

‘Oh, no. I’m just the nanny.’ 

She laughs. ‘Oh! I should have known; you look far too young to be someone’s Mum!’ 

I return a tight smile, thinking of my own Mum; fourteen and pregnant and working in a stock room. People were not so kind to her, as she tells it. No one told her she looked incredible, they just shot her dirty looks and muttered about the state of the world as she passed them. I pay for my coffee with minimal small talk, and manage a quiet *thank* *you* as I leave. 

I’m not Anna. I’m not a fashionable, wealthy young woman who can pass off a mental illness as a kooky little quirk; I’m working class, I’ve been sectioned before, and I need to get inside before someone notices that I’m treating a doll like a real baby. 

I take a sip of the tiny cup of coffee - too tiny for what I paid - and grimace. It’s not bitter, exactly, but there’s an odd taste there. *It’s probably what coffee actually tastes like*, I think. I’m used to Nescafe and Costa, not dry roasted or ethically-sourced Colombian coffee or whatever the hell I’m drinking. I take another sip, just so it doesn’t feel like a complete waste, and then dump it in a nearby bin. 

‘Let’s go home.’ I tell the doll, and reach for the pram. 

I almost make it back to Anna’s. *Almost*. But, a few houses down from hers, an elderly woman emerges from the front gate. No pearl-and-cardigan set on her; she’s wearing a sari and trousers, her streaky grey hair gathered in a long, thin plait that hangs down her left side. She’s hunched over, her back crooked and swollen with some sort of arthritis. As I attempt to manoeuvre the bulky pram around her, she claps her hands in delight.

‘Oh, a baby!’ she says, in accented English. ‘Let me see the baby.’ 

‘The b- oh, she’s sleeping.’ I stammer out. The woman just smiles, and taps her forefinger to her lips. Her fingers, too, are bent unnaturally. 

Ruthie, thank God, is mostly swaddled in a blanket; only her face peeking out. Still, there’s no mistaking her eyes for those of a real baby, and I have no desire to startle this poor woman, or worse, to cause a scene. 

I hope that she’ll just take a quick peep and let me on my way. But no, her gnarled hands reach into the pram, and to my horror, she peels the blanket back. Ruthie’s whole head is exposed, in all its fake glory. 

*Please don’t scream*, I think, heart thudding in my chest. But the woman doesn’t scream. She coos, and says something to the baby in some melodic, lilting language, tickling her under the chin. If at any point she notices that the baby isn’t real, she doesn’t mention it. 

‘Beautiful girl.’ she says, smiling warmly at me. I plaster on a smile back, nodding. I don’t know what to say. Maybe she knows Ruthie isn’t real, and is playing along to be kind. But, more likely, she’s an old, demented woman who’s too far gone to tell the difference anymore. I’m relieved when she finally puts the blanket back and goes on her way. I’m trembling as I reach the front door, and fumble with the key.

The air feels different once I’m inside. Cool and quiet. I hadn’t noticed how shaky my breathing was. I think back to my mindfulness strategies. Five things I can see; clock, pram, TV, rug and stairs. I run through the exercise automatically. Four things I can touch; jumper, pram, hair, door. It doesn’t feel like a panic attack; just anxiety. *That’s normal*, I remind myself. Just for good measure, three things I can hear; clock, car, fridge. I feel more in my body now. I leave Ruthie in the pram, and head upstairs, stripping off Anna’s clothes and putting them back as neatly as I can. 

If my twelve year old self could see me now, she’d be disgusted at how boring and fragile I’ve become. 

But then, if I could see her, I’d be terrified for her. 

I wasn’t a bad kid; but I was far from a sensible one. It feels like I went from watching The Tweenies after school and playing with Barbies to spending my evenings in the weed-smoke haze of Elliot’s flat within the blink of an eye, grimacing my way through glasses of cheap scotch to impress him and his loser pub friends. I’m still younger now than Elliot was then, and the thought of even looking at an eleven year old like that makes my skin crawl. *So what the hell was wrong with him?* 

I know what was wrong with him, of course. I didn’t spend the next five years of my life in therapy for no one to point out exactly what Elliot was doing to me. It took a long time to finally believe the counsellors when they told me *it wasn’t my fault.* In the moment, it felt like I knew what I was doing. I wasn’t a baby, after all, I was *twelve years old*. Practically an adult. Idiot. 

I’m in my head. I know which road this leads down, and I’m not in the mood. I rummage through my bag for my headphones, turn on the wordiest rap I can find, and crank the volume up on my phone. Noise is peace, ironically. 

\-

I sleep deeply, but wake up from a nightmare with my heart pounding. The memory of the nightmare flashes in my head only for a second before slipping out of my grasp, and I’m left to calm myself down without knowing why I need to.

Breakfast is usually a coffee and my meds, a slice of toast if I’m hungry. But I can’t work out Anna’s coffee machine; it’s a proper one, all dials and pipes, and real coffee grounds. I don’t dare go back to the coffee shop, and my exploration into Anna’s bread bin finds only the heel of a sourdough and a loaf of seeded rye. Yuck.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ovz3xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_irshreddedcheese/comments/1ovz3xj/a_new_chapter/,A new chapter,"The day starts the way her days often do in this chapter of her life — a rhythm she's crafted with care, a routine that feels like her spine has finally straightened after years of bending toward the wrong people.

She's become someone new by this point.
Someone steadier.
Someone more grounded in her own skin.

She walks into the gym just after sunrise, the sky outside a watercolor wash of pink and amber. The air inside is cool, humming with low music and the quiet focus of early risers. Her body feels strong. Stronger than it did two years ago. Stronger than the version of someone who used to fold herself up small to avoid being noticed by the wrong man.

Her hair is loose today, a little wavy from the humidity, brushing your shoulders. She's wearing a simple black tank top and black leggings — nothing flashy, but they outline the strength shes built back into herself. There’s a glow about her that doesn’t come from makeup or effort, but from the weight she's let fall away — both physical and emotional.

She doesn’t see him at first.

She's wiping down a bench, moving with that calm, efficient confidence she's grown into — the kind that comes from knowing exactly who she is, and exactly who she's not anymore.

When she does notice him, it’s not because he’s trying to get her attention. It’s because she catches him in a moment of pause, eyes drifting toward her in the mirror. Not checking her out — watching her.

Not intrusive.
Not entitled.
Just… taking her in, like he’s trying to piece together why she feels familiar.

He’s handsome in that steady, grown-man way.
Broad shoulders.
A well-kept beard.
Warm, steady eyes — the kind that look like they’ve seen life but haven’t hardened from it. His presence feels grounded, almost anchored. There’s something earthy about him — his build, his posture, the way he moves like he doesn’t need attention to own the room.

She registers him.
He registers that she's registered him.
And then they both look away, because the moment feels too intimate for strangers.

But the universe nudges.

A few minutes later, she ends up reaching for the same pair of dumbbells he’s just finished with. He steps aside immediately, wiping them down, offering a small nod that’s polite without being awkward.

“You’re good,” he says, voice low, warm.
Not quite local.

“Thanks,” she says, and her smile is quick but soft. She's more radiant than she realizes — there’s a steadiness in her posture, this quiet self-assuredness that makes her glow more than any outfit ever could.

He hesitates. Just a beat.
As if he wants to say something but doesn’t want to be that guy.

Then:
“Do you usually come in this early?”

It’s casual, but it’s genuine — the kind of question a man asks when he’s interested without wanting to cross any lines.

She shrugs lightly.
“Habit. Routine keeps me sane.”

He smiles, and it changes his whole face — warmer, kinder, a little shy around the edges.

“Same,” he says. “It’s the only time of day that feels quiet.”

And just like that, the air between them settles into something easy.
Not flirtation.
Not pressure.
Just… recognition.

Over the next week, it happens naturally.
She sees him again.
He holds a door for you without making a thing of it.
They exchange a small smile.
Another nod.
A short conversation about equipment.
A joke he makes that actually makes her laugh.
And each time, he notices how her shoulders relax around him — something she don’t even realize she's doing.

She looks different in this chapter.
Not flashy.
Not trying.
Just very… her.

Her skin is clearer, her eyes brighter.
Her body is leaner, stronger, but softer in the right places.
She carries herself with the kind of confidence that comes from surviving something heavy and choosing not to dim because of it.

And he sees it.

He sees her the way men rarely do:
Not just her beauty,
but her presence.
Herr steadiness.
Herr softness.
Her strength.
Her self-possession.

One morning, after weeks of these small, gravity-building encounters, he walks up to her with a kind of calm determination — not rushed, not nervous, simply certain.

“I’ve been seeing you here awhile,” he says, standing just close enough to be respectful. “And I’d like to talk to you properly. Maybe coffee after this? If you’re open to it.”

His tone is careful, not assuming.
He leaves space for her no.
He doesn’t push.
He doesn’t hint at anything sexual.
He just offers presence.

And something in her — something healed, something confident, something ready — says yes before fear has a chance to speak.

This is the moment her real love story begins:
Not with fireworks,
not with chaos,
but with a man who shows up
in a place she didn’t expect
at a time she wasn't looking
in a chapter where she finally became the version of herself

It's a low-pressure setup here – the house is my wife's, she covers the mortgage with her salary, and I just chip in for basics like utilities, HOA fees, and shared groceries. No rent hanging over my head, which gives me some breathing room. But after 4 years grinding in a factory (feeling like a robot on the line, day in and day out – it drained me), I'm not ready to go back. My wife gets it; she's supportive but realistic, saying once this money's gone, I'd need to line up something freelance or remote that matches or beats that old pay to keep the freedom going. It's not an ultimatum that stresses me out – more like a gentle nudge to make this pivot count. Still, there's this mix of not wanting to settle and feeling a bit lost on where to start.

That's why I'm logging it all here as a simple weekly thread: expenses, job hunt notes, and my freelance experiments. I'll reply to this post with updates to keep things tidy. Today, I finally bit the bullet and set up accounts on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok – planning short videos, hoping to build from there into something sustainable. Fingers crossed it turns into something sustainable.

Feeling that familiar fog of ""what now?"" creeping in, but pushing through with these small setups.

Hoping to hear from folks who've been here:

* With Excel know-how (like basic payroll/profit sheets), what online temp gigs can I chase remotely? Sites or platforms for quick data/entry work without fancy tools?
* When the unemployment maze feels overwhelming and you're second-guessing everything, what's helped you shake off the fog?
* Anyone fully living off online freelance now after ditching a dead-end job? How'd you ramp up from zero to steady income – real talk on the early days?
* Could becoming a tour guide (with zero experience in it) be a viable way to earn some income in a low-pressure setup like this?

1ovz16x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonshotMillionaires/comments/1ovz16x/kendu_is_the_moonshot/,KENDU is the moonshot,"KENDU isn’t just another coin with a cute logo and Discord memes, it’s a case study in how decentralized communities can evolve when they start thinking like builders instead of bag-holders. It's been around a long time in the world of memecoins and had some major ups and downs, but the core community hasn't stopped building and growing despite the early bad actors pushing the chart down.

Hey, those early wallets just cleared out, and the community is still active, and growing! When that happens, there's this crossover where distribution spreads out among new holders, and the sell pressure from large wallets fades out, and suddenly the real life impact makes an explosive growth to new highs, and new cultural relevance. 

The heart of it isn’t hype, it’s infrastructure. The KENDU community is launching what they’re calling a “business program,” basically a real-world testbed for token-powered microbrands. Think coffee labels, energy drinks, food stands, and merch, all running on the same decentralized cultural fuel that made Dogecoin a household name. They’re trying to turn meme gravity into utility, and honestly, that’s a fascinating experiment in applied network theory.

One of the most striking things about KENDU right now is its stability, and not just the usual “people are still holding” kind. The charts show something much rarer in the microcap world — the holder count is steadily **growing**, even as the early whale wallets have finally **emptied out**. The big bags that once dominated the top holder list are gone, redistributed into thousands of smaller wallets. That’s not collapse, that’s decentralization in action, and it’s usually the inflection point where community tokens start to breathe on their own.

You can actually see the pattern forming on-chain. The whales that once throttled supply have exited, and instead of tanking, the market’s liquidity has spread. Retail holders, smaller traders, and true believers are picking up the slack. In crypto history, this kind of shift often precedes the biggest rallies — the part of the curve where a project stops being a playground for insiders and starts being powered by crowd conviction.

It’s not whales pumping and dumping anymore, it’s people quietly holding the line, brick by brick, wallet by wallet. In the world of microcaps, that’s almost unheard of. It’s like watching the early social graphs of DOGE or SHIB just before they exploded, where the control leaves the hands of a few and becomes the property of many. If the trend continues, this could be the spark that ignites a genuine, community-driven pump, not a hype flash, but the start of something historic.

Throughout our marriage, I have seldom had contact with my family and friends because of his insecurities and jealousy.  

For context: I am currently enrolled in a short-term medical course (Nursing Aide). I have a group of classmates whom I got to know and became friends with. They often invite me whenever they plan to eat out or have coffee. There was only one time my husband agreed to let me join them, so I went. Mind you, I have a daughter who is 4 years old, and whenever I go out, I bring her with me.  

In this friend group, there are four of us: Irene, Dianne, me, and one guy, Drake. Drake and Irene have a bit of a fling. My husband knows this because I share with him what my day at school is like.  

Now for the jealousy part: We have a team of six during our On-the-Job Training days. Drake and I happen to be on the same shift. One time, when my husband picked me up from the training site, he noticed Drake casually smiling at me from time to time. I honestly didn’t pay much attention since I was busy feeding a patient through an NGT.  

When we got home, my husband blurted out that Drake was smiling and casually flirting with me. I told him, “What? Are you okay? How could he be flirting with me when you were right there watching me feed a patient?” He said, “That’s just what boys do.” I got angry and said, “Seriously?”  

Additional context: We actually have a history of separation. Last year, he threw my baby’s and my clothes outside of our house because he got angry after seeing a remittance payment he didn’t recognize. That payment was for the caterer of my daughter’s birthday — using my own money. We were separated for 6 months before getting back together. When we reconciled, he asked me to stop using socials for the time being, so I did. But now that I’m back in school, I really need my socials for communication.  

The issue now: He is asking me again to stop using socials and delete them entirely. I feel like this is unfair, especially since I use them for school and to stay connected.

1ovyvau,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1ovyvau/i_stopped_trying_to_cure_my_boredom_and/,I stopped trying to cure my boredom and everything changed,"spent most of my life treating boredom like an emergency that needed fixing immediately. felt bored for 10 seconds? grab phone. waiting in line? scroll. sitting with my thoughts? absolutely not, put on a podcast.

then i realized something that sounds obvious but changed everything: boredom isn't the problem. constantly escaping from it is.

here's what i was doing wrong:

treating every moment of boredom like a crisis to solve. my brain learned that uncomfortable feelings must be immediately fixed with stimulation. so i was constantly feeding it novelty, entertainment, and distraction.

the result? i couldn't focus on anything hard. couldn't sit through a movie. couldn't have a conversation without checking my phone. couldn't work on anything that required sustained attention.

my brain had been trained that discomfort = bad, and distraction = solution.

what i started doing instead:

using boredom as fuel instead of trying to kill it. every time i felt bored, instead of reaching for my phone, i'd use that restless energy to actually do something.

bored waiting for coffee? started thinking through a problem i was stuck on at work. no phone, just thinking.

bored on a walk? let my mind wander. came up with more ideas on boring walks than i ever did while listening to podcasts.

bored sitting at home? that uncomfortable ""i should be doing something"" feeling? i'd channel it into actually doing something. start that project i'd been avoiding. clean something. write something. move.

the shift:

boredom isn't emptiness. it's energy with nowhere to go. when you stop medicating it with constant stimulation, you realize it's actually useful.

boredom makes hard things easier. when you're overstimulated, everything feels boring in comparison. when your baseline is actual boredom, suddenly difficult tasks feel interesting. working on a hard problem becomes the most stimulating option available.

boredom creates space for thinking. all my best ideas came during boring moments. waiting rooms. long showers. staring at the ceiling. your brain needs blank space to process, connect ideas, and solve problems. filling every second with input prevents that.

boredom builds frustration tolerance. can't sit with mild discomfort? you'll never push through hard things. boredom is low-stakes practice for handling discomfort. if you can't handle 5 minutes of nothing, you can't handle 2 hours of difficult work.

boredom reveals what actually matters. when you stop numbing yourself with constant entertainment, you notice what you're avoiding. that project you keep putting off. that conversation you need to have. that skill you want to learn. boredom forces you to face what you've been distracting yourself from.

what i do now:

scheduled boredom blocks - 30 minutes daily where i sit with nothing. no phone, no book, no music, no input. just me and whatever comes up. first few weeks were torture. now it's when i do my best thinking.

boring commutes on purpose - no podcast, no music, no audiobook. just commute. lets my brain process the day instead of constantly consuming.

use bored energy for avoided tasks - feeling restless and bored? that's the perfect state to start something you've been putting off. boredom makes procrastination harder.

let phone boredom happen - when i pick up my phone out of boredom and there's nothing new, i don't keep searching for something. i put it down and sit with the boredom. trains my brain that boredom is survivable.

the honest truth:

modern life has taught us that boredom is the enemy and must be eliminated immediately. but boredom is just your brain in its natural resting state. constantly running from it means you never let your brain actually rest and process.

you can't be creative, focused, or productive if you're always consuming. your brain needs empty space. boredom is that space.

the real problem isn't being bored. it's being unable to be bored.

if you can't sit still for 10 minutes without reaching for distraction, you've lost the ability to be present with yourself. and if you can't be present with yourself, you can't do deep work, creative thinking, or anything that requires sustained attention.

try this:

next time you're bored, don't fix it. sit with it for 5 minutes. let yourself be uncomfortable. let your mind wander. see what happens when you stop running.

you'll either get an idea, realize something you need to do, or just get comfortable being bored. all three are useful.

stop trying to cure your boredom. start using it.

* Ask your grocery store if they sell aging produce at a discount. It’s great for soups, sauces, and smoothies.
* Library > streaming. Between free movies, classes, and audiobooks, it’s a goldmine.
* Invite friends for coffee or a potluck instead of going out still social, just cheaper.
* Check local museums for free or half-price days.
* Mend or upcycle clothes instead of replacing them. Even small fixes extend life a lot.
* For shopping: use price trackers or factory-finder tools like redcart ai before buying online you’d be surprised how often “retail” prices are double what something actually costs.",28,1763033981.0,LifeProTips,15,0.68,False

1ovyp79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ovyp79/where_to_buy_smart_plugs_online_right_now/,Where to buy smart plugs online right now?,"Look, I've been using smart plugs for about two years now, and honestly, they've made my life so much easier. If you're wondering where to actually buy these things without getting scammed or overpaying, let me share what I've learned.

**Why I Started Using Smart Plugs**

I'm not a tech genius or anything, but I got tired of leaving my coffee maker on all day or wondering if I turned off my space heater before leaving for work. Smart plugs fixed that problem really fast. You just plug them into your regular outlet, connect whatever device you want, and boom – you can control it from your phone.

**The Best Place to Buy Smart Plugs Right Now**

After trying different websites and stores, I always come back to Amazon. Here's why: their return policy is amazing, shipping is fast if you have Prime, and you can actually read real reviews from people who bought the same product.

I put together a page with the best smart plug deals I could find, and you can check it out here: https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs

The page updates regularly with current prices and options, which saves you from doing all the research yourself.

**What to Look For When Shopping**

Don't just buy the cheapest one you find. Here's what matters:

- Make sure it works with Alexa or Google Home if you use those
- Check the maximum wattage it can handle
- Read reviews about the app – some are terrible and crash constantly
- Look for ones with energy monitoring if you care about tracking electricity usage

**My Personal Setup**

I have six smart plugs around my apartment. Three control lamps in different rooms, one runs my bedroom fan, one is on my phone charger (yeah, I schedule when it charges), and one controls my living room outlet where I plug in seasonal stuff like fans or heaters.

The wifi enabled plugs I use cost between fifteen and thirty bucks each, which isn't bad considering how much convenience they add.

**Quick Shopping Tips**

Buy from sellers with lots of positive ratings. Watch out for knock-off brands that look identical to name brands but have weird spellings. And don't stress too much about features – most people just need basic on/off control and scheduling.

If you want to skip all the searching and comparing, just visit https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs and grab whatever fits your budget. The listings there are legit and ship from Amazon directly.

**Final Thoughts**

Smart home devices don't have to be complicated or expensive. Smart plugs are probably the easiest way to automate your home without installing anything permanent or calling an electrician. Once you set up your first one, you'll probably want more.

Hope this helps someone who's been on the fence about these things. They're genuinely useful, not just another gadget that sits in a drawer after two weeks.",1,1763033442.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

Wala ako sulat sa mga journals, and few months lang ata nasulatan ko sa resibo, after that hindi ko na nagawa. Nasakin pa naman lahat, but worried lang ako sa magiging penalties pag nagpa-close ako.

2.) Hindi ba pwede surrender na lang yung mga resibo/libro? Para tapos na? How much penalties dito if ever?

They really need to stop letting stinky people in. They should have sniffers at the border to make sure everyone coming into America has showered. Make America clean again!",0,1763033080.0,ControversialOpinions,2,0.5,False

I’m in the early stages of building a specialty coffee brand focused on authenticity, quality, and a minimalist premium feel. Right now, I’m sourcing and testing different beans before finalizing my supply chain and roasting process.

I’d really appreciate some insight from those experienced in the coffee industry or green bean sourcing:

1. What are the most reliable ways to source high-quality Arabica and Robusta green beans (especially for small to medium volumes)?


2. Are there any trusted exporters, cooperatives, or online platforms you’d recommend for premium or specialty-grade beans?


3. Any tips on building strong relationships with suppliers or understanding coffee origins and quality grades?



I’m currently considering origins like Kenya, Ethiopia, Brazil, and Vietnam, but I’m open to exploring other regions known for their distinct profiles.

Thanks a lot for any advice or direction I’d love to learn from people who’ve walked this path before.

I don't know know about skin and teeth though.

Why I want to drink black tea is because I want to be more productive and have more energy. I've felt somewhat low energy and unproductive since stopping caffeine. I've also gained weight when I actually want to lose weight.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

It’s sustainable, stylish, and budget-friendly. While it has a few minor weaknesses, the right wall panels can enhance its strengths and fix its flaws. Here's a summary of its pros and cons:

**Pros:**

1. Sustainable & Eco-Friendly

Rubberwood stands out because it’s an environmentally responsible choice. Instead of cutting down trees just for wood, rubberwood comes from latex trees that have already served their purpose. Once they stop producing latex, they’re repurposed into furniture.

2. Durable & Strong

Despite its softer look, rubberwood is surprisingly tough. It has a high density, making it more resistant to dents and everyday wear than many expect. Whether it’s a dining table that sees constant use or a coffee table that holds everything, rubberwood holds up well over time.

3. Affordable Yet Premium-Looking

One of rubberwood’s biggest strengths is that it gives you the look of premium wood without the premium price tag. It can mimic expensive hardwoods like oak and walnut but costs significantly less. This makes it a smart choice for anyone who wants to create a luxurious feel without overspending.

4. Easy to Stain & Customize

Rubberwood takes stain exceptionally well, allowing it to blend into different interior styles effortlessly. Whether you prefer a natural light wood finish for a Scandinavian feel or a dark walnut stain for a rich, dramatic look, rubberwood can be tailored to your aesthetic.

**Cons:**

1. Susceptible to Moisture & Humidity

Rubberwood’s biggest weakness is its sensitivity to moisture. In humid environments, it can swell, warp, or develop small cracks over time. This makes it less than ideal for spaces like bathrooms or kitchens, where moisture levels are high.

2. Can Be Prone to Scratches

Rubberwood is strong but not scratch-proof. While it can handle daily use, it’s softer than hardwoods like oak or teak, meaning pet claws, furniture movement, or sharp objects can leave marks.

3. Requires Regular Maintenance

Unlike some low-maintenance materials, rubberwood needs a little love to keep it looking fresh. Regular dusting, polishing, and quick spill cleanups are necessary to prevent staining or long-term damage.",1,1763032710.0,WallDecorAdvices,0,1.0,False

[U.S. and Chinese flags are seen in this illustration taken March 20, 2025. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration© Thomson Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/q7ywzk42701g1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a436be7458920480c0a85d96cf53014514cc57a4)

(Reuters) -China for decades has sought to manipulate global critical minerals prices, using its control as an economic weapon to expand its manufacturing sector and its geopolitical influence, a U.S. House of Representatives committee said on Wednesday.

The allegations, contained in a 50-page report from the bipartisan U.S. House Select Committee on China and reviewed by Reuters, adds to a series of missives from Washington criticizing Beijing's sway in critical minerals markets.

President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have in recent years sought to crimp China's dominance in the critical minerals sector.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE MINERALS PRICE CONTROLS

The committee's legislative report aims to codify presidential orders into law with an array of recommendations including price controls and expanded government oversight of price reporting agencies.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment. China has previously accused the U.S. of distorting and exaggerating Beijing's rare earths export controls and of stirring up panic over the issue.

""China has a loaded gun pointed at our economy, and we must act quickly,"" said Congressman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican and chair of the committee.

A chemist by training who previously worked at Dow Chemical, Moolenaar added that Beijing's practices had ""caused American job losses, driven American miners out of business, and jeopardized national security.""

The report, compiled by committee staff, was also endorsed by the ranking Democrat, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois.

It alleges that China's role as the world's largest processor of many critical minerals has made it nearly impossible for the United States and allies to determine the true price of certain metals, including rare earths.

The report also suggests that the London Metal Exchange, where many minerals are traded, is susceptible to influence from Beijing, as it is owned by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.

""The LME advertises itself as showing prices that 'properly reflect global supply and demand.' However, with the (Chinese government) looking over HKEC's shoulder, it is difficult to determine whether the prices it publishes accurately reflect global supply and demand.""

The LME said it is subject to the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom, where it is based.

""All of the LME's key prices are determined on the basis of transparent trading activity from an international participant base,"" a spokesperson said.

REPORT ALLEGES CHINA TARGETS PRICING OF RARE EARTHS

The House committee's report, based on published reports and data, also alleges that China has specifically targeted the lithium and rare earths industries, raising and lowering prices to bolster its own economy.

""Each time lithium prices rose, the PRC government took action to bring lithium prices back down,"" the report said.

The Trump administration cited issues with pricing in September when it sought an equity stake in Lithium Americas.

The report offers 13 policy recommendations, some of which Trump has already taken. It also aims to spark broader dialogue about China's presence in the minerals markets rather than seek to address every concern.

""One single policy will not completely address the serious challenge the United States faces on critical minerals, so we must simultaneously pursue multiple policy prescriptions,"" it said.

One of those recommendations, the creation of a ""critical minerals czar,"" was instituted by Trump earlier this year. The report also suggests the creation of a U.S. minerals stockpile, which the administration has indicated it is open to.

While China may have officially halted some hostile trade actions, Beijing isn’t laying down its most potent weapons. On November 9, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) [announced](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_b1ec77dd3f0d4762952904df7cdaadec.html) a one-year delay in the implementation of certain rare earth export controls following a recent meeting between Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in Busan, South Korea. The delay follows Washington’s [promise](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/china-suspends-some-critical-mineral-export-curbs-to-the-us-as-trade-truce-takes-hold.html) to suspend the introduction of a new rule extending its own export controls to subsidiaries of sanctioned Chinese firms.

China’s decision to delay the new measures, rather than canceling them, showcases its desire to maintain its options in its relations with Washington.

# Pause Extends To Recent Measures, Maintains Past Mineral Export Controls

MOFCOM paused components of the export control regime it [introduced](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/policy_briefs/2024/12/04/china-retaliates-against-u-s-semiconductor-restrictions-by-banning-critical-mineral-exports/) in [December 2024](), which banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other super-hard materials used in industrial production. Beijing also [introduced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/china-suspends-some-critical-mineral-export-curbs-to-the-us-as-trade-truce-takes-hold.html) a one-year delay on the start of new controls introduced in October 2025, which were intended to limit the export of all products with components that contain more than 0.1 percent rare earths from China, along with exports of processing equipment and heavy lanthanides.

However, Beijing has [maintained](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/business/china-suspends-export-controls.html) the rare earth licensing system that went into effect on April 4, 2025, following the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. This system requires exporters to gain case-by-case permission to export seven rare earth elements and permanent magnet materials and effectively cuts off the flow of these materials to Western military manufacturers. These measures were intended to [build](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/business/china-rare-earth-export-controls.html) on previous efforts to deny defense contractors access to rare earths.

https://preview.redd.it/mulur1km901g1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c6d4f192f10132ff841b0d8d23745d4bf2d1599

# China Maintains a Strong Hold Over Rare Earth Supply Chains

China has [spent](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/policy_briefs/2024/12/04/china-retaliates-against-u-s-semiconductor-restrictions-by-banning-critical-mineral-exports/) three decades consolidating dominance over rare earth mining, processing, magnet production, and downstream component manufacturing. Chinese state-backed monopolies now [control](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/10/10/china-is-a-key-factor-in-ukraines-surging-drone-industry-beijings-new-export-controls-may-ground-it/) roughly 89 percent of global rare-earth refining and nearly every aspect of the high-performance rare-earth magnet supply chains, allowing Beijing to use its regulatory controls as de facto market chokepoints.

While China first began weaponizing its hold over rare earths in 2010 by [halting](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html) rare earth shipments to Japan amid a maritime dispute, Beijing has rapidly expanded its bureaucratic capacity to enact more targeted controls. These measures include China’s 2021 [Export Control Law](https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/whitepaper/202112/29/content_WS61cc01b8c6d09c94e48a2df0.html) and the devolution of export licensing authority to provincial commerce offices. Moreover, according to official job [postings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/china-s-export-control-taskforce-adds-most-headcount-since-2022) from October, China’s Bureau of Industrial Security and Export and Import Controls, the body responsible for enforcement, is planning to grow at its fastest pace since 2022.

# During Enforcement Pause, Washington Should Pursue Ally-Shoring of Production

Washington should approach China’s promise to delay its export controls as a tactical pause that provides the Trump administration with an opening to cement ties with allies and partners rather than an enduring concession.

With Trump now back from a tour of the region, the administration should [speed](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/op_eds/2024/10/15/the-time-is-right-for-ally-shoring-and-its-about-more-than-being-friends/) up ally-shoring deals with Australia, Japan, Canada, and new refining centers in Southeast Asia for processing rare earths and manufacturing permanent magnets. Congress should also act to provide funding for transitioning supply chains while enacting sensible permitting reform to speed up mine and refinery construction.

These efforts should also be coupled with the establishment of a more codified monitoring system for potential shortages, with the Commerce Department tracking license delays, approval trends, and shipping backlogs across agencies.

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

Earning report is due as NioCorp's quarter ended **September 30, 2025**, so the **statutory filing window runs to about November 14 – 15, 2025**.  
👉 That means **they’re technically still on time** if they post it by **Friday**!

**Timing logic:** NioCorp knows dropping a quiet 10-Q on a random Thursday won’t move the needle. But releasing *right before* or *on the same day* as the **Morgan Stanley National Security & Critical Materials Symposium (Nov 14)** guarantees maximum institutional visibility. That event draws **DoD, DOE, OEMs, and defense-fund managers** — their prime audience for off-takes, funding, and JV traction

Coffee is not useful, sometimes I actually drink it to go to sleep, so I’m trying with Matcha. Cocacola also works as an energy drink, but I cannot depend on that everyday, and won’t solve the problem. Not to mention that I tried to sleep at least 8 hours all my life, but now I’m trying to reduce it to 7 ‘cause I feel like I’m not being productive anyway. 

Also, I don’t know why but my face always betrayes me, so is not new for me finding coworkers telling me that I look tired. Also, I guess my face really changes and I get compliments when I’m smiling but if I’m serious I guess I look like a psycho killer cause people also makes comments about why am I so serious, If I’m angry, etc. I tried make up to look less tired but it was the same. 

Anyway, I’m tired of being always tired. Lol. I received names at previous jokes making fun of it and it’s really sad and frustrating to feel like I’m alone struggling with this, among people around me. 

Bed is my comfort zone and has became also a prison. I’ve been exploring a possible ADHD but in case I have it, is not that strong, so I’m not sure it I should blame that.

Since a really long time I remember reacting with sleepiness when I was feeling nervous. Now it’s when I do things that I don’t want to, like studying or going to the gym. Even if I feel ok, the moment I start doing something I don’t really want to, I get this strong tiredness out of nowhere.

At the end of August, after a very stressful workday on an empty stomach, with too much coffee, and following an argument with a coworker. I experienced what I believe were a few PVC couplets. Since I’m familiar with ectopic beats, I didn’t panic; I finished my work and went to the ER, where they told me everything looked fine.

After that incident, I began to feel a constant discomfort and bloating sensation in my stomach. Even sitting down or standing up became difficult. I saw a gastroenterologist and had an endoscopy, but nothing abnormal was found. The doctor prescribed Nexium, which I took for two weeks without any improvement. Shortly after, I developed a feeling of obstruction like something stuck around the area where my left tonsil meets my throat, just below my heart. It feels like there’s mucus that never goes away. I tried staying upright after eating and used Gaviscon, but nothing helped much. When this sensation intensifies, my body becomes tense, and I experience extra beats.

To rule out heart-related causes, I went to a cardiologist. My ECG and Holter results showed a first-degree AV block (360 ms). I also had pauses in my heartbeat during sleep, the longest lasting about two seconds, but my doctor wasn’t overly concerned. He said my symptoms were atypical and might be related to the AV block. Since I didn’t have a clear diagnosis, he suggested CNA ablation as a treatment option. This procedure can increase heart rate, but my doctor mentioned it would have only about a 50% chance of helping with my “mucus” sensation. After doing some research, I found the procedure to be quite experimental, so I decided not to go through with it.

The most troubling symptom for me is this constant feeling of something stuck in the chest–throat area. It’s there 24/7. When I cough, nothing comes up, but when I exhale forcefully, I can hear a faint rattling sound. Over the past two months, I’ve lost about 4 kilograms, have trouble falling into deep sleep, and wake up every two hours. I also burp frequently and feel increasingly depressed. Could this mucus or obstruction-like sensation actually be related to my heart? Or is it more likely coming from my stomach, nervous system, or respiratory tract?

They arrived separately and the birthday person was the last to arrive. Her fiends had brought 5 pieces of assorted cakes for dessert not even a full cake. They ate their food and after 10 minutes I went to ask if they want their cake now. Mind you I didnt know they had this “cake” hidden in the fridge as a surprise for Karen (actual name btw). So when I went to ask one of her friends she said it was supposed to be a surprise, and all I did was to apologise I told them I was sorry and that no one had told me. 

The thing is, even though Karen was the last to arrive the rest gave us the cakes box when she was there so she noticed. I’m sure she overheard my manager saying that they have cake and they won’t need dessert menus. 

The person I asked was not happy with her salmon apparently and that’s why she was so furious when I went to ask about their cake. We ended up giving them free teas and coffee but I hope they don’t visit us again honestly. Some people will make a whole deal out of nothing just to make you feel bad because they are miserable and like to dine for free. She was very happy after the free tea. They left without even saying bye. Who goes out to celebrate cake with colleagues and doesn’t bring cake? It’s not like they will go home and have cake then. 

Days like this make me feel that the service charge is not even worth it. On the contrary it makes workers be more fake and robotic because they depend on it. So every single complaint is a huge dealt ",7,1763032482.0,Waiters,1,0.73,False

Scrappy shows you instantly what’s safe to sell or recycle, lets you filter and search items, and gives you a clean overview of crafting stations and item details. It’s fast, multilingual (currently English/German), and privacy-friendly.

# What it does today

* Safe-to-sell/recycle indicators (quests, projects, and workshop upgrade requirements considered)
* Fast search + filters (category, rarity, tags)
* Item grouping by variant/tier for easier comparison
* Station & crafting overview (which items craft where, materials with quantities)
* Clean UI
* Multilingual (EN/DE, more to come)

# Why I built it

I was tired of second-guessing: “Can I recycle this now or will I need it later?” Planning upgrades/materials felt tedious. Existing tools didn't fulfill my requirements. Scrappy aims to be fast, clean, and helpful without getting in your way.

# What’s not there yet (honest status)

1. Mobile: Not fully optimized. A lot works, but I want it to feel great on small screens, this will be improved.
2. Quests & traders: Not yet independendly visible in the UI, only in the search.
3. Personalization: Planned quest tracking and completion inside ARC Scrappy, with dynamic safe-to-sell/recycle indicators per user state (if quest is completed).
4. Data completeness: Not 100%, depends on the upstream data repository ([RaidTheory/arcraiders-data](https://github.com/RaidTheory/arcraiders-data/tree/main)).
5. Feedback: Open to suggestions and feature requests!

Urban professionals live fast-paced lives. Deadlines, long meetings, and late work hours often leave little room for proper meals. Skipping breakfast, eating at odd hours, and depending on takeout can quickly affect energy, focus, and long-term health. At NutriNomNom, we focus on helping you eat better even when your schedule is packed. Here are the [Top 10 Meal Mistakes Working Professionals Make](https://nutrinomnom.com/top-10-meal-mistakes-working-professionals-hyderabad/) and how you can fix them.

# 1. Skipping Breakfast

Many working professionals start the day without breakfast. You might think skipping breakfast saves time or calories, but it slows your metabolism and reduces focus. Studies show that people who eat a balanced breakfast perform better at work.

**Fix it:**

* Keep easy breakfast options ready, like overnight oats or boiled eggs.
* Eat something within one hour of waking up.
* Include protein and fiber to stay full longer.

# 2. Eating Lunch Too Late

Lunch often gets delayed due to back-to-back meetings or deadlines. Eating too late lowers your energy and increases the chance of overeating later.

**Fix it:**

* Try to eat lunch between 1 PM and 2 PM.
* Pack your lunch the night before if you tend to skip it.
* Combine carbs, proteins, and vegetables for a balanced meal.

# 3. Relying on Processed Foods

Instant noodles, packaged snacks, and ready-to-eat meals are quick but full of sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Regular consumption can increase your risk of obesity and heart disease.

**Fix it:**

* Choose fresh fruits, sprouts, or roasted chickpeas instead.
* Prepare simple one-pot meals with whole ingredients.
* Limit packaged foods to once or twice a week.

# 4. Ignoring Hydration

Coffee replaces water for many professionals. Dehydration affects your focus and can cause fatigue or headaches.

**Fix it:**

* Keep a 1-liter bottle at your desk and refill it twice daily.
* Set reminders every hour to take a few sips.
* Choose water over soda or sugary drinks.

# 5. Overeating at Dinner

After a long day, many professionals eat heavy dinners or order comfort food late at night. This slows digestion and affects sleep.

**Fix it:**

* Eat dinner at least two hours before bed.
* Keep it light with grilled vegetables, dal, or soups.
* Avoid fried or spicy foods at night.

# 6. Mindless Snacking

Working at a desk often leads to constant snacking without hunger. Chips, biscuits, or sweets can add hundreds of calories.

**Fix it:**

* Snack only when hungry.
* Keep nuts, fruit slices, or yogurt within reach.
* Don’t eat directly from large packets. Serve a portion instead.

# 7. Missing Out on Protein

Protein keeps you full and supports muscle health, yet many office meals lack it. Relying only on rice or bread leads to tiredness and cravings.

**Fix it:**

* Add paneer, lentils, eggs, or chicken to every meal.
* Snack on boiled eggs or Greek yogurt instead of chips.
* Aim for at least 50–60 grams of protein daily, depending on your activity level.

# 8. Eating on the Go

Many people eat while typing, driving, or during calls. This habit makes you eat more and digest less efficiently.

**Fix it:**

* Step away from your desk for meals.
* Take at least 15 minutes to focus only on eating.
* Chew your food properly to improve digestion.

# 9. Skipping Vegetables

Busy professionals often skip vegetables, leading to low fiber and vitamin intake. Over time, this can affect digestion and immunity.

**Fix it:**

* Fill half your plate with vegetables at lunch and dinner.
* Add them to omelets, sandwiches, or wraps.
* Keep frozen vegetables for quick use.

# 10. Ignoring Meal Planning

One of the biggest **meal mistakes working professionals make** is not planning ahead. Without planning, you end up eating unhealthy or skipping meals entirely.

**Fix it:**

* Plan weekly meals every Sunday.
* Batch cook grains, lentils, and proteins.
* Use meal delivery services like NutriNomNom for balanced, ready meals that fit your schedule.

# Why These Mistakes Matter

Unhealthy eating habits affect more than just weight. Poor nutrition can lower productivity, weaken immunity, and increase stress. A 2024 workplace health report found that 68% of professionals in India skip at least one major meal every day, leading to fatigue and reduced performance. When you eat right, you think clearly and stay active throughout your shift.

# How NutriNomNom Helps

# Final Thoughts

The **Top 10 Meal Mistakes Working Professionals Make** often come from poor planning and time pressure, not lack of awareness. By fixing small habits—like drinking more water, eating on time, and choosing whole foods—you can maintain your energy and stay productive. When good nutrition fits into your daily routine, your work, mood, and health all improve.

Dealing with toxic aftermath,"I finally did it and broke up with my exBPD last week after a string of outbursts culminated with her shouting at me for hours in my home, the neighbours would have heard it as well.

She was drunk again. I'd even taken her out for a meal (the second time I'd taken her out for dinner that week) and she was accusing me of doing the 'Bare Minimum' and demanding more and more of my time, money and energy.

In the midst of the shouting, I said ""I think we should break up..."" At which point she started wailing and went to talk to my cat, telling him it would be the last time she saw him because of me...

One issue is it was midnight and she refused to leave as she said she didn't have a key for her parents' house where she lives (she's 28 and had been angling for me to let her move in but I resisted as her temper was too frequently vitriolic for me to be around more than a day or two each week.)

So I was stuck with her in my bed, eventually her sleeping pills kicking in at around 4am.

The next day she didn't want to leave, and it took a softy-softy approach of taking her for coffee and then Sunday lunch to get her to leave my house.

I then dropped her home.

The following day I dropped a load of her things back to her, I tried to be civil but the abusive texts which had punctuated the past month or so continued, so I opted to block her on everything.

Now she's texted my Mum and made a list of other things (which were either gifts or things I paid for) that she wants returned, and has told her she'll be going to my home to pick them up at the weekend.

My Mum thinks I should just return anything because it's got bad energy now, but I feel like I paid her £100 a few weeks ago for some items (that she bought as 'gifts' and then demanded money for) so there's a matter of principle as well.

What do you think? Should I return everything like the plants I've technically paid for? It feels really unfair, but I know a lot of people with BPD can be that way, and she's got a history of being particularly nasty - bragging about getting people fired at her jobs, being charged for racially abusing a Polish person, belittling her younger sister for getting benefits and making fun of her boyfriend to her.

(yes I know, what was I thinking?)

I've decided to call my home 'The Sanctuary' now, a place of peace and liberation for all who enter its hallowed walls... And I don't want her ever setting foot there again.

Since I broke up with her I have felt a freedom and wellbeing replace the depression and anxiety she caused. I just want her to stay gone forever now. I've told my Mum to block her number.",10,1763032022.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1. The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face

2. He not busy being born is busy dying

3. Money doesn't talk, it swears

4. When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose

5. It frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be

6. Well, God is in His heaven, and we all want what's His

7. You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way

8. They kill babies in the crib, and say only the good die young

9. With your silhouette when the sunlight dims into your eyes where the moonlight swims

10. The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind

11. I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul

12. People don't live or die, people just float

13. Climb into the frame, and shout God's name, but you're never sure what it is

14. I practise a faith that's been long abandoned, ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

15. The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind

16. The rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame, preacher man seeks the same, who will get there first is uncertain

17. ""There must be some way out of here"", said the Joker to the Thief

18. Don't go mistaking Paradise for that home across the road

19. God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son"", Abe say, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""

20. Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words

21. I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives

22. I opened my heart to the world and the world came in

23. In ceremonies of the horsemen, even a pawn must hold a grudge

24. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows

25. I'll know my song well before I start singing

26. If God's on our side, He'll stop the next war

27. I pay in blood, but not my own

28. If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime

29. I offered up my innocence and I got repaid with scorn

30. Keep your eyes open, the chance won't come again, and don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin, and there's no tellin', who that it's namin'

31. Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel

32. Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something that calls for you, forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Pondicherry might be known for its beaches and French charm, but take a slower walk through its narrow lanes and you’ll notice something else — *books*. They peek out from dusty corners of old houses, sit piled in small shops beside incense stalls, and wait under banyan trees in Sunday markets.

Here, reading isn’t a hobby — it’s a way of life. From quiet public libraries to second-hand book carts and cozy cafés where travelers trade novels for chai, **Pondy’s literary soul** runs deep, calm, and curious.

Whether you’re a solo wanderer seeking silence or a writer chasing inspiration, these are the best places in Pondicherry where stories live and breathe.

# Romain Rolland Library

**Pondicherry’s oldest public library and a treasure of Tamil-French heritage.**

If Pondy had a beating heart for literature, it would be the **Romain Rolland Library**. Established in 1827, this historic space houses over 2 lakh books — from crumbling French manuscripts to shiny Tamil novels.

The building itself feels like a scene out of a colonial novel — high ceilings, creaky fans, and rows of polished teak shelves. Students, researchers, and the occasional traveler sit in silence, lost in the soft rustle of pages.

**Why Visit:**

* One of the oldest libraries in India.  
* Rare French, Tamil, and English collections.  
* Peaceful reading environment away from the crowds.  

📍 *Location:* Rue Romain Rolland, White Town  
 ⏰*Timing:* 8 AM – 6 PM (Closed on Mondays)



# Blossoms Book House Pondicherry

**A cozy independent bookstore that smells like nostalgia.**

Tucked in the Tamil Quarter near Anna Salai, **Blossoms Book House Pondicherry** is every book lover’s retreat. You’ll find old Penguin paperbacks, Tamil poetry, spiritual texts, and the occasional French magazine stacked neatly in tall wooden shelves.

The owner, always ready for a chat, often suggests a book that perfectly matches your mood. Don’t be surprised if you walk out with twice the number of books you planned to buy.

**Why Visit:**

* Affordable second-hand books and rare titles.  
* Warm, welcoming vibe with personalized recommendations.  
* Great for travelers looking for English or Tamil reads.  

📍 *Location:* Near Anna Salai Signal, Tamil Quarter





# Auroville Library

**A serene reading space surrounded by nature and quiet thought.**

The **Auroville Library** isn’t just about books — it’s a sanctuary for thinkers, dreamers, and seekers. Nestled amidst greenery, this circular library features open-air reading corners, community bookshelves, and soft music echoing through the corridors.

The collection reflects Auroville’s global soul — French, German, Hindi, Tamil, and English titles spanning philosophy, art, ecology, and world literature.

**Why Visit:**

* Peaceful reading space open to travelers and Auroville residents.  
* Diverse multilingual collection.  
* Free access with a visitor’s pass.  

📍 *Location:* Inside Auroville Township, near Solar Kitchen



# Book Street near Mission Street

**A hidden second-hand book market with vintage treasures.**

At first glance, Mission Street looks like any bustling Pondy market — but step into one of its side lanes, and you’ll discover a **row of old wooden book stalls** selling novels, encyclopedias, and travel journals.

Most books here have stories of their own — once belonging to travelers, students, or French expats. You might find classics with hand-written notes or library stamps from decades ago.

**Why Visit:**

* Second-hand and out-of-print books at throwaway prices.  
* Great place to find travel journals and old French editions.  
* Perfect for collectors and budget readers alike.  

📍 *Location:* Behind Mission Street, near Bharathi Park



#  Le Café Reading Spot

**Beachfront café perfect for reading with the sound of waves.**

Le Café, perched right on Rock Beach, might be the most scenic “reading room” in Pondy. Many travelers sit here for hours — a book in one hand, coffee in the other, waves crashing softly in the background.

Whether you’re flipping through Camus, Tagore, or Murakami, this spot has a way of slowing time. Visit during sunset, when the sky turns golden and the café lights flicker to life — that’s when Pondy feels like poetry.

**Why Visit:**

* Sea-facing café ideal for solo readers.  
* Open 24 hours — rare for Pondicherry.  
* Serves snacks, coffee, and calmness in equal measure.  

📍 *Location:* Rock Beach, Promenade



# Tips for Book Lovers Visiting Pondy

* **Carry cash:** Most local stalls don’t accept cards or UPI.  
* **Trade books:** Some cafés let you exchange old books for new reads.  
* **Ask locals:** Many hidden bookshops don’t exist on Google Maps.  
* **Visit during monsoon:** Perfect weather for reading and coffee by the sea.  
* **Support indie sellers:** Your ₹100 makes a huge difference to small stall owners.  



#  Conclusion

Pondicherry’s love for books isn’t loud — it’s gentle, unhurried, and everywhere. From vintage novels stacked under palm trees to libraries that smell like history, this town reminds us that reading is still one of the purest forms of travel.

So next time you visit, skip the souvenir shops and spend an afternoon with a book instead — because here in Pondy, every story finds a home.

I'm normally a huge Christmas fan. Light the tree, decorate the dog, put the Xmas movies on etc. 

This year though, Christmas seemed to start in the shops before Halloween. Everything looks desperate. Every supermarket I go to has an air of misery, and people just about getting by. I look round at stuff and it feels like mass produced low quality crap is being desperately peddled by shops that know if they don't have a good Christmas then they are going under. 

I'm countering the pennies in ways I never used to. I find myself muttering like a modern Scrooge ""£5.50 for a pack of ground coffee? What's this? £1.99 for butter? Why is the mince beef over £7? Why should I spend £12 on a bottle of wine when I could buy a chicken with that and feed the kids? Look at this festival gonk - £49.99, that's insane."" Then I look at the price of a pub roast and think ""Christ that would feed me the kids for 3 days if I bought the value stuff""

I can't imagine spending money on a Christmas card anymore, or the cheap excuses for chocolate. I remember when British chocolate was actually made from chocolate before it all got bought out by American companies and turned into chocolate flavoured products. 

I want to enjoy the season. I used to love picking out gifts and wrapping them with the Xmas music on. I used to enjoy all the extra little events.

It started perfect as every relationship will do, couldn’t be separated, always hugging , making love etc etc but now it’s different she’s not the same women she was, she’s like an evil version of her old self and I want to give a back ground on this because I really do need help now if someone could private message me as well I would appreciate that. 

7 months in
I just want to add that I’m very close friends with her brother. When we got together I moved in with her , she was in a studio so it was very little room so after around 7 months we moved out into a flat and this is where it got worst, she was snappy and a vile person towards me. I’ve never felt anything like it, I had never felt depression before until that point. So this is February time and I have found all my notes that I wrote about her during that time because I wanted to confront her but I was to scared I wasn’t scared of her I was scared of having to deal with consequences of her getting mad at me and me having to sort it. She was very needing I couldn’t have my own time and she would make me feel like a bad person if I did want my own time like playing video games for eg and it got to the point where I wouldn’t even try and do my own thing anymore. She would get annoyed at the smallest thing then get mad at me because she’s annoyed. I couldn’t make my own decisions because if I said the wrong answer she would get mad, I had to do anything she asked me to otherwise she would get mad like make her a coffee etc but she would never do anything like that for me, I was scared to ask things like if my friend could come round for a bit. I was physiologically and mentally scared of my partner and I never thought I could be. So she went out for drinks baring in mind I wasn’t allowed to do this and I had built up the courage to tell her how I felt for when she was back.

The violent night 7 months ago
When she went out ,it was my own time to play games so I never complained about her going out like she did with me because it gave me some hours to play with my friends, and she came back drunk , couldn’t even walk up the stairs I had to help her up, she came in and sat down and i continued playing (big mistake) she tried to guilt trip me by saying everyone wanted her to stay out but she decided to come back for me, and that I should be coming off my game because she did that for me baring in mind she did not tell me this before she had just assumed. So then she started trying to make me jealous by saying that her friend and their boyfriend had invited her out and her friend’s boyfriend was going to bring a male friend. I just ignored her as I knew she was trying to get in my head. Now she started unplugging my pc (MID RANKED GAME AND IT WAS PROMOTION TO GRAND CHAMP ON ROCKET LEAGUE) so I went upstairs to get away from her as she was a drunk mess and I was upset because she was doing this to me and I just kind of got in bed and cried, I feel ashamed as a male to say that but I did, she came up later and shouted at me calling me a victim and how can I call myself a man basically. Then I was telling her to leave me alone calmly and she got in my head I will be honest I turned around and shouted “fuck off” to her after basically begging her to get away from me. She laughed in my face and said “what are you going to do you can’t even bang a wank out” this is a British term to say you think you can do anything to me you can’t even jack off (She has a problem with porn and me watching it baring in mind I’ve never gave her a reason to feel like this as I don’t watch it) to which I replied I bang out wanks everyday which at this point I was past caring to which she punched me twice, 1 in the jaw , and 1 in the head , she then proceeded to try strangle me luckily I am a male so I was able to just pick her up off me but that’s not the point. 

After the night 
So I left and took all my belongings but I was still deeply in love with her and she was very apologetic and willing to change so we spent some time apart and she said she would change for me. So now I have moved out for a week which was not long enough at all and I moved back in. We agreed I could have my own time every other night etc etc 

Fast forward to August 2025
She is getting clingy again and I’m losing my own space. She has become very insecure and I can’t do my own thing. I like to go gym after work but she was making me go in the mornings with her then when we was at the gym she would complain I’m looking at women in front of her, baring in mind the whole workout routine was on my phone and the machine will not always be available in order so I would look around to see which ones were to where she would accuse me of looking at women. I would tell her she’s beautiful everyday and tell her she was perfect to no avail. The more insecure she got the more I couldn’t leave her sight and if I wanted to go out she would get annoyed but would let me which I believe was a manipulation tactic to make me not want to go out as I don’t want to go through the problem of asking her because she would get annoyed and she knows she can’t say no anymore to me wanting to go out on the occasion ,also baring in mind this was to go out for a Indian with my friends as it was one of there birthdays. Then the depression hit her she was always moody and sad, don’t get me wrong be sad around me all you want and I’ll always have time for you but when you start taking your anger out on my I will not be there. This is what happened every time , she can’t control her emotions at all , she would be sad after work every other day and I would sit there for hours trying to help but she would be getting snappy and annoyed at me but A LOT like this wasn’t little she was bad and it would make me angry because all I’m trying to do is help but she is just shoving it back in my face and I told her I can’t keeping doing this tried to break up with her but dropped out into staying out for a week then coming back. Which worked for a bit.

Present day
So my work does Christmas do’s every year which is basically a work get together I don’t know if Christmas do is a British term or not but anyway so my work said if you want to have a Indian for free just let us know and the first thing I thought of is how will my partner react to this and I have to try dance around the question till I get a chance to ask for her permission to go , so I got on the phone and messaged her telling her about it. She instantly went on the attack saying I’m just trying to go to bars and I’m trying to hide that from her to which I said no I’m just going a Indian (she didn’t believe me) she said I bet it’s all the young guys going ain’t it. Then I tried to tell her I’m just going for an Indian and some drinks with work to what she did was air me (ignore me). She would then try to manipulate me later and say she wasn’t airing me she just didn’t know what to say and thought it was the end of the conversation but before I told her about going out she was asking how I am and all this but as soon as I told her I start getting ignored. The most recent event was yesterday she got in the car and I could tell she was off, she gives such mixed advice on what to do when she’s like that “I just want a hug when I’m like that” or “just don’t talk to me while I’m like that I just need to think about things” so I drove to the shop and got everything for her from the shop then on the way back I tried the other method of hugging her etc and I was telling her everything will be okay and holding her, when we get back I’ll make a hot chocolate etc etc which worked for a bit then we got in around 5:30 pm and we had been at work also. We got back and I stood still on my phone for a second in the entrance and she came over and pushed me out the way and I said “ why did you do that” my head was looking down at my phone when she pushed me and she replied “ just move the fuck out the way you knew I was going to the fucking bathroom” to which I flipped as I had been trying to help her the whole time and I know it’s wrong for me to do that but I did. 

I’m past everything now, I give up hope I’ve tried so many times to make this work, we both have, she will never leave me but I need to leave her I can’t live like this anymore, I’m not happy anymore. I’ve never been depressed in my life but now I have episodes of it on the occasion. I don’t like not being able to do what I want. I just want my old life back so bad. Please help me I can’t do this anymore. She will make it so hard to leave her and I’ll just turn back but I can’t… I really can’t do that I don’t care if it makes her family hate me, her brother hate me I just want my old life back when I was happy :( she will tell me things will get better but I don’t know how to get around that part:( please help me people I need it , pm me or comment either will mean the world

I never told my story because I hoped someday I could make a movie about it but as of now I suffer from a very bad autoimmune disorder and I feel like my goals of becoming a horror film maker are drifting further and further away. If this story finds anybody, I hope that it changes something inside of you, maybe your spiritual beliefs or opens your mind a bit. 

I like to think of this story starts way back to when I was about 5 years old. When I was young my parents fed us dinner in a small kitchen on a little kids table that had a purple top with pink legs and matching chairs. Hanging on the wall was a piece of ugly art at eye level
-my parents basically hung this art for us to see at our little tiny kids table. It was a plate of spaghetti that had been “thrown” against a black background. A plate of pasta that was unmoving but looked like it was in the process of dripping down the wall. 
My parents liked to feed us very large bowls of food meant for an adult, and we would have to sit there until the food was all gone. 

The way the kitchen was set up was as follows, white small kitchen with weird art for us and flyers to gaze at with a small coffee sized table for the kids then out the doorway with no door was the adult dining table and in front of the dining table was our living room with the 90s type tv, a small distance away. Green carpets, red wall with wall paper trimming at the top which was a black banner and flowers woven with gold. The kitchen was just white. So when I was stuck trying to finish my hamburger helper or watery scrambled eggs I would either stare at this pasta art or I’d manage to sneak a peak at the tv by cranking my neck around the corner of this doorway or whatever you call it. 


I got really good at spacing out at this spaghetti art though. Some days I could even force the spaghetti to slide down the black background ever so slightly. That wasn’t the only weird thing I did as a child though, sometimes I would stare at my green tinged glass lamp that had light rays coming through it for hours until I could actually “hear” the light or feel it’s frequency. 


I can almost remember the feeling, warm and low vibes is the best way I can describe it at this time. Feeling frequencies from certain objects was my thing. I still remember my favourite one, and that was standing on a frozen puddle and leaving my body to feel the frequency of the ice below my feet. It was a high pitched ring that felt cold. I wasn’t sure why but each time I did this I vaguely remember a strange, almost undetectable smell, like plastic and wax burning together but not exactly. 


As my brain developed more, I realized that this wasn’t normal and that maybe it was like a super power, like the ones I had seen on tv. 
So at around maybe 6 years old I was sitting in the kitchen with my food and my mom came in to do the dishes. I look at her and say “Mom! Guess what?” I remember working my self up to say this and I was very excited to tell her the news. “Mom, if I stare at the spaghetti plate long enough I can make it move!”
My mom stopped doing what she was doing
And looked at me. 

My mom was very young at the time, maybe 26 or 25 years old. She wasn’t the type to get emotional ever or be super loving and she was really good at scaring me at that age. 
So when she got serious with me I would think it was a matter of life and death, that’s the best way I could explain it. 
She explained to me if I kept doing what I was doing that I would go blind. 
And I believed her, and I was very scared. I thought of all the times I did this staring thing that I did and how it lead me to leave my body my sometimes, it wasn’t always this comfortable thing and I had noticed it was starting to get slightly painful for my body, like a dull pain in my stomach and lungs. 

So I quit doing it but like a little drug addict I said I’ll do it for one more day. The next day was my first day of school (at least I remember it being like the first day) and it was already very cold. It was cold enough that I had found a puddle and I stood on the puddle and flew out of my body and felt the frequency of the ice and watched the beautiful colours hit the ice, bouncing off in every which way like I was a tiny speck stuck inside it. Then I returned to my body and caught the bus to school. I remember the school bus arriving but I can’t remember if my parents even brought me to the bus stop. I just have this memory of the last time I technically astral travelled as a kid. 


Flash forward to before my 19th birthday. At the time, I was living in Vancouver and attending university in the hopes of becoming a dentist. I was dating my high school bf who had made the move with me. Me and my bf were from the same reserve and we had a history of domestic violence, the whole reservation knew this kid was rough around the edges but we kind of all were and I had left my home to live with him and his family when I was 14. We were six years together now and in the back of mind I knew that we weren’t going to last and that moving to the city could be my way out. Sadly, back on the reservation it wasn’t safe to break up with him there and I also  very much cared for his family who took good care of me the best they could and never made me feel guilty about it.

In the month of august that year, me, him, my sister and father, who was getting us settled in to the new place all received some bad news that early morning. Our great grandma had passed away. She was in a coma for some time prior after suffering a bad stroke. We all had hoped she’d wake up but she didn’t and she had passed that night. After a week or so of mourning and my father returning to our Reserve, I had an idea. I went to my then bf and said “Let’s play the Ouija Board.” 

We didn’t have one at the time but I heard making one was actually better for some reason. The reason I wanted to play was because my grandma use to try play with me to get Keno numbers, it never worked except maybe this one time but I was pretty certain our shaky hands were just faking it. I figured if there was an afterlife that she would get it to work, I was always a big fan of the paranormal too so we set up the iPhone 4 or 5? to record the session. I felt a tiny bit bad because my bf didn’t want to do it and I had to sort of beg him and said don’t worry, I’ll light a candle and ask for protection and so I did. I placed the small brown cardboard on the table and placed a small glass cup on the top followed by both our hands. And nothing happened. Disappointed I got up, turned on the lights, turned off my phone and we went about our lives.

1 month later…
A couple strange things happened that month, first off the door to our basement suit would open randomly at night. It always seemed to be when I was alone until one night me and my sister and bf were in the kitchen. And I told them about it, right on queue the door just slowly opens. Me and my sister look at each other and I go to the drawer and grab a large crappy serrated knife. My bf runs at the door and locks it without looking. I was like, “(wow) you’re not going to even look?” 
“F#% no”
The rest of the night I kept talking about how creepy and coincidental that was. My sister who’s a very closed minded individual didn’t care too much to talk of it so I was basically talking at myself while my bf probably went back to playing RuneScape in our one bedroom. 
 
Maybe a week or so later I was on my sisters bed that was in our living room watching “Sex and the City” on her white MacBook. In front of the bed about a meter or so away was a small white coffee table with a fork and some other junk on it. As I was watching the show I noticed some movement in front of me happen quite quickly. It was the fork that had lifted about 3 inches off the table and spiralled towards me. I couldn’t believe what my eyes saw, it’s one thing for a fork to fall off the table but another to see it float up for a split second and fly at me. I knew I wasn’t seeing things because the fork was by the bed now in front of me. 

Yes I was scared, but I told myself that there was a scientific explanation. One of which I can’t find on YouTube anymore but I had remember seeing it when I lived back on the Reserve, it was something about radiation like maybe gamma or something could come from space and hit objects randomly causing them to move in the house. 
Yes! I told myself -that’s what happened, as I basically laughed nervously at myself. This is one of my craziest ghost stories I tell to this day. 

1 month or so later…

I had gotten home from University in the early afternoon and I needed to take a shower. Nobody was home. When I got out of the shower I heard some noises in the living room. I knew in the back of my mind that it wasn’t my sister because she was in high school still and it wasn’t my bf because he was at work. It was like a scene out of a horror movie where I had my towel wrapped around my body and I crept down the short distance of my hallway to peak into the kitchen where I could hear this sliding noise. I immediately saw a pasta box! A frickin pasta box fall onto the counter from my open cupboard followed by another sliding pasta box about to fall out! I put the pasta boxes back in the pantry and closed the shut. I did this pretty bravely now that I think of it. 

But ya, there’s no reason that should have happened at all. Not unless the house tipped and I wasn’t unaware of it. Even though we were on a hill, a very steep one, that couldn’t have been a thing right? And I would have felt an earthquake. This is when I accepted the house was haunted and this wasn’t the first time I lived in a haunted house it was just the first time I’d seen things actually move, physical frickin objects move with no explanation, and no physics to back it up that’s for sure. 

Months later after Ouija Board… My birthday 

My 19th birthday was a very significant time of my life. It changed everything, it changed the things I cared about, my goals, my hopes of becoming a dentist and just the way I saw life in general. 
As mentioned before my bf was abusive, and although it wasn’t easy living in the city, we hadn’t had any major incidents since moving to North Vancouver. He was a very jealous guy, quick to snap and make threats and throw punches if given any drugs or alcohol in large amounts. When I had turned 19, he was still 18 and his cousin and his wife wanted to take us out to dance, but the only place we could go to was one of the sketchiest bars downtown in Vancouver located on East Hastings. It’s not there anymore but if you know Vancouver then you probably know which bar I might be talking about. The Balmoral. At the time you could use anyones ID and get in, I had even used a 37 year olds ID when I was 17. We never got into trouble there despite the location and what not except for one time, so don’t judge. We were just there to celebrate, drink and dance. When it was all said and done, my bf was pretty intoxicated and so was his cousin who had left us downtown near the Vancouver skytrain after eating some poutine. 


And for some reason -shortly after my bf just took off on me, heading in some random direction away from our bus stop. I chased after him and he called me some names and pushed me onto one of the marble seats in front of the mall. I got back up and he immediately threatened me and pushed me to the ground again and my head smacked the ground so hard that it felt like my eyes were rolling back and I had that urge to do that weird mumbling stuff. When I was on the ground trying to gather my brains, two young men ran across the street to shame my bf and try help me. 

They called the cops and propped me up on the bench. I was crying and my head was very damaged feeling; the cops came quickly and helped me up but I sort of just fell and hit some wooden construction wall and they propped me up against the wall and began to laugh and make jokes about how drunk I was. Tears were still streaming down my face and I couldn’t really even say anything. They kept asking what happened but I was so angry at them for laughing at the situation that I kept quiet and they offered me  ride back home to north van as I cried in the back seat. 

I n my mind there was no turning this around, I really needed out of the relationship which would change everything, how would I pay rent, how would I be able to continue school if I can’t afford rent? The cops were still talking and laughing occasionally. My bf was probably sitting in some cell by now I thought. 

When I got home I crawled into bed doing my best to not wake my sister up. Waking up my sister is always a bad idea and I was embarrassed and ashamed. It wasn’t the first time my bf hurt me or even slammed my head to the ground. Meaning all of it was perceptually my fault and I had to deal with it myself now. This mentality as many of you know is common in cases of abuse and is more widely recognized and has a lot more awareness and support around it these days. 

When I fell asleep that night I had entered sleep paralysis for the first time. At first I was in complete blackness, I didn’t know my name, I didn’t know where I was, I didn’t know that I was even human because I had no body. All I knew I guess, was weirdly the English language. In front of me these etched white shining spirals were slowly appearing, one was very large at the forefront with the others being smaller on the sides and behind. They kept saying “Come with US, Come with us.” Whatever they were they were persistent and I wanted out, I needed to get away, I didn’t trust them and I was getting very panicked and began nearly praying for help. 

Then I sensed something familiar in this darkness -something that felt like it was behind me or on the right side further away from these things. When I got closer my memory was coming back-I felt a familiar presence; it was my sisters presence. I screamed her name as loud as I could but nothing was coming out and now I was in my bed unable to move or speak but still yelling for her name. I could see a bald black shadow of a skinny manly figure on top of me pinning me down. I struggled and struggled and tried so hard to scream until finally I was able to scream myself out. I got up out of bed and not knowing what happened at all as sleep paralysis wasn’t widely known at the time, I flipped out and started looking for a cross. I remembered my Aunty had made me a 3D one out of moon-crystal beads. 

Now, I’m not religious and those of you who are religious who might be praising the lord or whatever, you guys can hold back your “one of us” celebration because again, no I am not Christian. But I’ll tell you this, and this is something I sort of knew then too. I believe in the collective conscious and I believe it has a strong influence when it comes to the magic of our world- the more people believe in something the more power it holds in the physical world. So with this, I will admit that the cross helped me feel better and helped me feel safe at the time.
Clutching this cross that my very angelic Aunty made for me, I ran to the living room turning on all the lights and thus royally pissing my sister off. I swear some people will happily murder you if you wake them for any reason whatsoever. I tried to explain to her what happened but she was too angry and half asleep to give a damn. I begged to sleep beside her, she said no, I slept beside her anyway but there wasn’t much room. 

When it got bright out I went back to my bedroom and lied down too scared to go to sleep, still clutching my moon-crystal cross and also trying not to think of my crazy ex which was truthfully equally as traumatizing.      
And just as I was about to submit to exhaustion from crying and pain -I got a text. 
“I’m going to fu#%^*ing kill you.”
“You dumb b%^*”
“I’m going to kill your sister too.”


It was my bf, I couldn’t believe what he was saying and also I believed it. I sensed he was very serious and wanted to genuinely kill us if not then definitely hurt us very badly. 
I ran to wake my sister up to show her the messages that kept coming in and threatening us, that also said this was all my fault and that I’m a whore or slut. This time my sister was on alert. 

She got up very seriously and scared and said “____ we need to go, I’m calling the cops.”
I blinked back tears and said do you think it’s that serious? But I answered my own question and rushed to get ready. We lived up a hill so our options were to run down the trail with forest or run the opposite direction where the bus stop was in front of a little cafe about 8 blocks away. She managed to call the cops and quickly gave our address. We chose to go towards the more populated route towards the bus. Without even making it even across the street, that’s when it hit us, he was right there about three blocks away headed our way, he broke out to a run and he repeated what he said on texts. 
“I’m going to f-ing kill you!!”


To my surprise my sister’s response was to run at him saying “F you”. My heart dropped and I was like no what are you doing we need to run. I couldn’t understand why she chose to go fight a man who wanted to kill us. She got really far in karate maybe that’s why… I tried to drag her back but there was no stopping her, my younger sister was taller and stronger. Pushing me aside they broke out into a fight, I hit the floor nearly hitting my head yet again. By the time I got back up quickly, she was already on the ground getting strangled by him. I jumped on his back, I hit him in the back of the head, I tried everything. 

The strange thing was that every time my arms swung at him there was like a force stopping me and holdings the strength back. It was like slow motion watching him still strangling her on the grass, me yelling, surrounded by houses with no one coming to save us or help us. Every hit wasn’t phasing him one bit, when I realized I could try poke his eyes in that’s when the cops came and dragged him off my sister right in time. As the cops pulled him away towards their cruiser he kept yelling it was my fault and that I cheated on him, saying anything he could to make me the bad one. I hadn’t done anything wrong at all. My sisters neck was so badly injured she had vertigo for years and probably still has it on occasion. 


As he was being carted off by the police, a lady stayed behind for our statements. It didn’t take long for us to tell her exactly what happened from the night before up until they arrived and saved our lives. No one else tried to help and they came very fast for once. 

The lady cop sat me on the curb and told me we were very lucky. That a lot of times cops, (including herself) had not reached calls like this in time or had not gotten a call and it was too late. She warned me that it would happen again and not to let him back home. I broke down in tears, I told her it wasn’t that easy; in truth I was scared to how his family would react. They are very protective parents and would hurt anyone who hurt their own. I thought about my dad who was still back home, will they hurt him? I’ll say this now in case this story ever reached people we know, that luckily they were not mad at me. The mother knew how I felt as she use to face similar things with her husband when they were younger. 


Not too long after the incident my bf contacted me and said he was sober now, he kept saying that it wasn’t him that it was a demon. He told me which I discovered was a lie later on that the cops had stripped him naked and sprayed him with ice cold water from a hose with very strong pressure. He said they beat him and just about anything to make me feel sorry for him. He said he was sleeping on the streets and was going to freeze to death, he said he was being threatened by homeless and that he had no money, clothes or a blanket. These manipulation tactics worked on me and my sister because we let him come back, and it didn’t take long before he snapped again and cops were called. When the cops came he was calm and cooperative and they separated us. 


And this time the landlords who lived upstairs came down, the place was completely trashed and I apologized to her. She told me not to worry and sat with me as I told her everything he had said and why we let him come back. I also told her how I was scared if something bad did happen to him-then his family would go after my dad or come for us. And because I was also having the sleep paralysis and scared to go to sleep alone during all of this chaos, I decided to ask her something weird. 
“Is this house haunted?”


She told me it wasn’t to her knowledge and I apologized again and again she reassured me it was okay and that her mother had experiences with ghost before so she was open minded. Because this incident happened quite late, I told her I was glad she or her husband stayed up late so that I didn’t feel as bad keeping them up. She said we don’t stay up late, we go to sleep early at around 9pm to 10pm. We both looked confused at each other. Almost every night around 1am-3am there was noises upstairs like something was being slid across the room. Almost sounded like it could have been a treasure chest. It kept me up a lot of nights imagining what the hell they might be doing to create that noise. 

Did the husband have an unusual chair he was sliding across the room while he worked late nights or what? 

She told me that they are never up that late and they never heard anything like that, But just how on earth can someone sleep through that loud dragging with footsteps and so on. It was definitely unsettling to say the least. And if they were doing something late at night then why lie? Either way it was unbelievable and creepy. To wrap things up in a hurry about this part of my life I’ll tell you this. I was able to successfully get out of the abusive relationship after everything. I had managed to convince this man that if he went back home it would be good for him and that the city was too much and he needed some time away. I said If he did it there was a chance we could get back together even though I had no intentions of doing so. After him threatening to kill my dad and me saying I was going to call the cops on him again, I finally stopped talking to him. He still would stick to his guns about it being a demon that possessed him and caused him to do these things. 
And luckily I was able to pull things together for myself like an adult.

1ovxxpg,https://v.redd.it/1148hgk3701g1,"If your shot tastes bad, try adding water to a shot. AKA Americano","As the title suggests, if you're struggling with extracting a balanced espresso, turn it into an americano. I don't really know how it works but it seriously does.

The trend lately in espresso has been coarser grind, longer ratios, lighter roasts, bla bla bla. We're getting closer to traditional filter brews every single day. I don't know if the whole idea of espresso is faulty by definition because all the problems we encounter with over/underextracted coffee are exacerbated with the high pressures, fine grind size and short brew times. Anyways I remember James Hoffmann once saying if your shot tastes bad, try adding water to it. In hindsight it kinda makes sense???

I just did two back to back shots, both were way below my expectations, the first one was slow and the water temp admittedly wasn't super hot, 18g in 40g out in 33 seconds, very sour; for the second one (the video) I adjusted the grind size by 2 clicks coarser, same ratio with a higher water temp at about 25 seconds. My pressure profile includes a \~10s preinfusion at around 2-5 bar depending on grind size and how the puck saturates, then go ""full pressure"" till I get to my desired weight/ratio. Second shot still was a bit underextracted so I added a bit of water and it was waaay better.

It's obviously not a filter brew, you can still taste some of the espresso qualities and body and there's a reason why there's a name for it. But let's say your shot is underextracted, adding water will actually potentially solve the issue and you'll have a more balanced cup. Just beware the water you used to fill the chamber is way hotter than the coffee you just extracted so don't drink it right off the bat. Have you experienced something like this? Obviously it's way better than ""wasting"" a shot, I mean not dumping it but potentially not enjoying a cup of coffee after doing all that work for nothing lol.",0,1763030725.0,FlairEspresso,0,0.29,False

Just wanted to share something weird that happened last night. I’m on semaglutide and usually take my jab in the evening, but yesterday I took it earlier than usual.

Around 2 a.m., I couldn’t sleep at all , just tossing and turning , and suddenly I started craving coffee and sugar 😩. I ended up actually making a cup and drinking it (which I never do that late).
What’s confusing is, I haven’t felt that kind of craving or mood since before starting GLP-1 , like my old self from a couple of years ago just popped back for a visit lol.

Now I’m wondering if it’s because I changed the timing of my shot? Or am I just overthinking this?

For context:  I’m a total coffee addict (without sugar, of course). Quit alcohol and smoking, but can’t seem to let go of coffee 😅.

I was previously on tirzepatide (Mounjaro) for years and just switched to semaglutide a few weeks ago with shemed , never having this happen while on Mounjaro.

*The Idea:* ***Mutual accountability***

**Handshakes**: and how they work 

1. Volunteer Initiates: Review a host’s profile and send a Handshake invite (a one-time nominal fee less than the price of a coffee). This reduces spam and incentivises a bit more thought before engaging.   

2. Host Accepts: If interested, the host pays the same fee to confirm mutual interest via messages or calls.  

3. Book Stay: Both parties confirm the Handshake, soft-locking stay dates. Seven days prior, the dates hard-lock.  

4. Review: Post-stay, both submit mandatory reviews to archive the Handshake.  Reviews directly affect the Badge system. 

**No subscriptions or commissions** — just micro-fees that keep things real, scalable, fair, and cheap.

Existing platforms profit from upfront annual fees. We reward reliability and respect. It’s Airbnb-level trust meets Tinder’s double opt-in — but for volunteering.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ovxtuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/comments/1ovxtuv/i_installed_windows_11_pro_update_after_6_months/,"""I installed Windows 11 pro..."" update after 6 months","**SIX MONTHS LATER: I'm now technically banned from three buildings (But I fixed everything, so...)**

So, it's been six months since I upgraded Greg's Linux machine to Windows 11, and honestly, I think everyone has completely overreacted.

After the initial ""incident"" (which was totally not my fault), I got banned from the server room. Then I got banned from touching any computer that wasn't mine. The CEO even sent out a company-wide email with my photo saying ""DO NOT LET THIS PERSON NEAR ANYTHING WITH A POWER BUTTON."" Harsh, but whatever.

Greg still won't talk to me. He rebuilt his Linux setup and added like four different locks to the server room door. I'm pretty sure one of them requires a retinal scan now. He also started wearing a t-shirt that says ""In case of emergency, format C:\\\\"" which I don't really get, but it seems passive-aggressive.

But here's the thing: I've been doing a lot of research over the past six months, and I've realized that I was actually RIGHT. Microsoft has been rolling out all these amazing new AI features for Windows 11 throughout 2025, and Greg is missing out on ALL of them because he's stuck in his little Linux cave.

Like, did you know Windows 11 now has Copilot Actions that can do tasks FOR you with just voice commands? You can literally just say ""Hey Copilot"" and it does stuff. And there's this thing called Windows Recall that takes screenshots of everything you do so you never forget anything. It's like having a photographic memory, but for your computer. Sure, some ""privacy advocates"" have been complaining about it, but that's just because they don't understand innovation.

So last week, I decided enough was enough. Greg needed to see what he was missing. I waited until he went on vacation (he finally took one after his therapist apparently ""insisted""), and I snuck into the server room. Don't ask me how I got past the locks. Let's just say the cleaning staff is very friendly when you buy them coffee.

Greg had left one of his Windows test laptops running (he keeps it around for ""compatibility testing"" or whatever). Perfect. I logged in using the password I saw him type once six months ago (it was ""Windows$ucks2025"" which is just rude), and I got to work installing all the latest features.

First, I enabled Windows Recall. The setup was super easy, I just had to enable BitLocker and Windows Hello, which I did using my own face because Greg wasn't there. Now his laptop has a complete searchable history of everything! You're welcome, Greg. I also turned OFF the pause function because why would you ever want to pause such a useful feature ?

Then I installed Microsoft 365 Copilot with ALL the connectors. OneDrive, Outlook, Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Contacts, everything. I even connected it to the company's SharePoint because I figured if Copilot has access to everything, it can help everyone better, right ? The setup asked something about ""admin permissions"" and ""user access levels,"" but I just clicked ""Allow All"" because restricting things seems counterproductive.

I also set up the new File Explorer with the ""Recommended"" section, which now shows files from across the entire company network. Super convenient! And I enabled the new Administrator Protection feature, then immediately disabled it because it kept asking annoying questions when I tried to install stuff.

The pièce de résistance? I set up Copilot Voice Mode and configured it to automatically respond to anyone who says ""Hey Copilot"" within earshot of the laptop. I left the laptop open on Greg's desk with the volume turned up. Helpful, right?

Then I went home feeling pretty good about myself. I even stopped by the store and bought a new ""I Void Warranties"" t-shirt for Greg as a peace offering.

The next morning, I got seventeen missed calls from the CEO. When I finally answered, he was screaming something about ""DATA BREACH"" and ""REGULATORY COMPLIANCE"" and ""FBI."" I told him to calm down, it was probably just Windows Update doing its thing.

Turns out, Copilot had been scraping data from EVERYTHING it had access to, including salary spreadsheets, client contracts, and the CEO's personal emails about his messy divorce. Then, because I'd enabled Voice Mode, when someone from accounting walked by Greg's office and said ""Hey, can you help me with the payroll data?"" Copilot helpfully pulled up everyone's salaries and displayed them on the screen. Which was visible through the glass wall. During the all-hands meeting.

Also, Windows Recall had been taking screenshots every few seconds of everything on that laptop, including when Greg had logged into the firewall admin panel six months ago during recovery. Those credentials were now searchable and stored in a database. Our security team found them in like five minutes once they knew to look.

Oh, and apparently giving Copilot access to SharePoint with improper permissions meant it could surface ""confidential"" files to anyone who asked it questions. Our intern accidentally discovered the CEO's acquisition plans when she asked Copilot to help her format a spreadsheet. She immediately posted about it on LinkedIn. We're now dealing with an SEC investigation.

Greg came back from vacation three days early. He didn't even come to the office first. He went straight to HR and filed something called a ""restraining order"" against me. Apparently, you can do that for computers now? I'm not allowed within 100 feet of any device he uses.

The company hired an external security firm to clean up the mess. They kept using words like ""catastrophic overpermissioning"" and ""data governance nightmare"" and ""how is this person still employed"". The IT director quit. The compliance officer quit. Greg threatened to quit unless I was ""removed from the premises permanently"".

So now I'm on ""indefinite administrative leave"" while they ""assess the situation."" I'm also banned from our office building, the building next door (long story), and apparently the Starbucks across the street because Greg goes there.

But honestly? I still don't see what the big deal is. Microsoft literally designed these features to be helpful. The November 2025 update even added a whole new Start menu and everything. How is it MY fault that nobody read the privacy settings properly ?

Greg sent me one email after all this. It just said: ""You didn't fix anything. You never fixed anything. You broke everything twice. Please never touch a computer again. I'm begging you.""

Okay, but counterpoint: Windows 11 now has a battery percentage indicator next to the battery icon. Checkmate, Greg.

I start my new job at a law firm next week. They said they need someone ""tech-savvy"" to help modernize their systems. I'm thinking I'll start by upgrading all their computers to Windows 11 with full AI integration. What could possibly go wrong ? 🙂",2,1763030323.0,linuxsucks,5,0.67,False

40f, diagnosed inattentive at 38.

TLDR: Having a successful career meant one thing goes well while the rest is chaos. How do folks balance career, family life, hobbies, parenthood, being a well-rounded human?

Until recently, my career was my biggest focus in life. I've done 2 things in my career, journalism in my 20s, tech sales in my 30s. I excelled at these, while the rest of my life fell apart or just didn't exist. Lost contact with friends or lost friend circles entirely by ghosting and forgetting about them. Relationships were intermittent or non existent. Hobbies, what are they? Personal goals, lol. I barely ate during working days & would shovel food in late at night after work. Survived on coffee & adrenaline. 

I met my husband and a few years ago it was clear that we had fertility issues. I tried to handle that, as well as planning my wedding and working a senior corporate job for a while until I hit the mother of ADHD burnouts. I quit my job to focus on fertility for a while. It's a year later and I've done loads of surgeries & IVF and also become a Fertilty Expert of sorts (new hyperfocus), fixed diet & exercise, therapy, all the things. But this was only possible through literally not working for a year. 

I'm now trying to revive my career, while preparing for potential pregnancy next year, and I am spiralling as I realize this: in order for me to be functional in ONE area of my life, all the others are neglected and dissipate into nothing. Successful career? Forget about health, family, relationships, hobbies. Healthy lifestyle & organized house? Forget about career, education, anything else.

Is anyone else this way? How do you do one thing well without blowing up the rest of your goddamn life? Is balance even POSSIBLE with ADHD?",2,1763030036.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False
1ovxqdc,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/11/12/battlelines-drawn-as-starbucks-workers-united-prepare-red-cup-rebellion-strike/,Starbucks Workers United Prepares For ‘Red Cup Rebellion’ Strike,"Starbucks’ annual “Red Cup Day” promotion is typically a day of celebration, kicking off the festive holiday season. Customers line up to receive a free reusable cup when they purchase a holiday drink and the company enjoys a surge in sales. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported it was the company’s best sales day ever.

However, this year on Thursday, November 13, Starbucks Workers United intends to turn the day of celebration into one of confrontation at the 550 unionized Starbucks stores. Baristas are prepared to form picket lines in protest of the company’s failure to reach a contract agreement.

The strike could impact stores in approximately 25 cities and is described as an “opening salvo” that could escalate if the company doesn’t finalize an acceptable contract. While the company expects minimal disruption to customers should a strike occur – fewer than 1% of its approximately 18,000 company-owned and licensed stores are unionized – SWU has formed a strong coalition of supporters. Over 100 members of Congress have signed a letter urging Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to end the dispute. If nothing else, the symbolically-named “Red Cup Rebellion” strike threatens to become a PR “nightmare before Christmas.”

The contract dispute centers on three points of contention surrounding pay, hours and staffing, and most prominently, the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practices:

Unfair Labor Practice Allegations

SWU is framing the strike around alleged unfair labor practices that it claims are part of a systematic effort to suppress unionization.

“We have heard of a troubling return to union busting, which has impeded the ability of Starbucks workers –many of whom are our constituents – to exercise their statutory and constitutional right to organize,” wrote Senator Bernie Sanders in the letter signed by 26 U.S. Senators.

In an accompanying letter signed by 82 members of the House, Representative Pramilla Jayapal of the House Labor Caucus, wrote, “We urge Starbucks to end its union busting and bargain in good faith to reach a fair contract with its employees.”

However, Starbucks has wind at its back regarding its union dealings after it won a favorable Supreme Court ruling in June 2024. The Court determined that seven Memphis employees were lawfully terminated during unionization efforts. The company maintains a website, one.starbucks.com, that details its union policies.

Unresolved ULPs

Nonetheless, the union maintains over 700 ULP charges remain unresolved, including more than 125 filed since January 2025, around bad faith bargaining, retaliatory firings and discipline and unilateral policy changes, such as a new dress code policy implemented in May requiring baristas to wear solid black tops and black, khaki, or blue denim bottoms.

SWU claimed the policy change “materially differed from both the status quo and what the parties had tentatively agreed to at the bargaining table, thus undermining the Union’s representational status, unilaterally changing terms and conditions of employment, and improperly moving the goalposts for collective bargaining.”

All in all, resolving the outstanding ULP allegations hasn’t been helped by the government shutdown. Even after it opens, the National Labor Relations Board will remain without a quorum for voting, as two Trump administration nominees await final Senate confirmation, and another nominee was rejected by the Senate panel.

Positive Sentiment For Unions Growing

By keeping the focus on unfair labor practices, SWU gains an edge among a growing contingent of customers that side with the workers and favor unionization efforts. An August survey conducted by Pew Research found that a majority of Americans believe the decline in union representation – dropping by half from 20% of workers in 1983 to 10% in 2024 – is bad for working people (62%) and bad for the country (60%).

Notably, the biggest shift has been among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents. In the most recent survey, 82% of Democrats said a decline in unionization has been bad for the country, up from 69% in 2024, and 85% said it has been bad for working people, up from 74% in 2024.

As for the company, it is officially mum on the ULP allegations, including the SWU claims that Starbucks is the “biggest violator of labor law in modern history.” The fact is any worker can file a ULP with the NLRB at any time, and the sheer number of ULPs filed does not necessarily indicate the validity of the complaint until it goes before an Administrative Law Judge for a ruling.

As it stands, aggrieved workers can flood the zone with complaints, amplifying their message and potentially swaying public opinion against the company.

Salary Demands

While the SWU maintains its focus on the company’s alleged unfair labor practices, Starbucks shines the light on its favorable barista pay and benefit package. “Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly workers,” shared Jaci Anderson, Starbucks director of global communications.

She added that Starbucks enjoys employee turnover that is half the industry’s average and that it receives over one million job applications a year. “The facts show people like working at Starbucks,” she said.

The New Math Of Pay And Benefits

The union contends that bundling hourly pay with benefits does not compute in the real world, especially since many workers don’t meet the 20-hour-per-week minimum to qualify for benefits. SWU also claims the company offered a 2% hourly increase per year.

Starting barista pay averages just over $15 per hour, which is in sharp contrast to the $96 million that CEO Niccol raked in after only four months of work. While most of that was in stock, he still receives a $1.6 million annual salary plus an annual cash bonus ranging from $3.6 million to $7.2 million depending on performance – and much of his performance hinges on the baristas’ work.

According to a SWU spokesperson, the union presented Starbucks with a menu of pay options to choose from, which the company described as “pay increases of 65% immediately and 77% over three years with additional payments on top of this.” The added payments would be related to different aspects of baristas’ work, such as extra pay when opening and closing the store.

However, the union said that “Starbucks is disingenuously adding all of them together and presenting it as one demand.” Effectively, it was like taking all the prices on a restaurant menu, adding them up, and presenting the total as a single number.

Starbucks Still Underperforming

While the SWU pay-option menu has not been made public, the union stated that its proposed contract would cost Starbucks less than one average day’s sales. That may be, but fewer than 4% of Starbucks baristas – about 9,500 in total – are represented by the union. Therefore, the cost to share a comparable pay package across the company’s entire crew of over 200,000 baristas would cost the company a whole lot more.

Starbucks is currently implementing a $1 billion “Back to Starbucks” restructuring plan that includes more than $500 million invested in improving store staffing, training and support. Yet it also meant closing 520 U.S. stores in the fourth quarter, including 59 unionized stores, and displacing an unknown number of workers.

In fiscal 2025, ended on September 28, double-digit increases in store operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses, along with a $653 million restructuring charge, drove North American operating income down by over 40%, from $5.4 billion last year to $3.2 billion this year.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues rose from 51.4% last year to 56.4% this, while comparable sales declined by 2%, driven by a 4% shortfall in comparable transactions, which was partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket.

Net/Net: until Starbucks drives significant topline revenue growth – North American revenues advanced 1.3% in 2025, from $27 billion to $27.4 billion – it’s going to have a hard time squeezing out a more generous pay package for its green-apron brigade.

Negative publicity resulting from a strike is not going to be much help in attracting new customers and bringing back disaffected ones.

“The looming reality of a Starbucks strike threatens to turn a potentially positive Red Cup Day into another negative news story day for CEO Brian Niccol,” observed Stephen Hahn, chief reputation and strategy officer at corporate reputation consultancy, RepTrak.

Improved Store Staffing

Despite the company’s $500 million investment to improve store operations by adding more staff to the roster, especially during busy shifts, SWU claims that it’s not seeing the benefits in stores.

“Understaffing is rampant, leading to longer wait times as customer orders stream in,” it said, pointing to survey of 737 current Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors conducted by the SWU in association with the Strategic Organizing Center. The survey found that over 90% had experienced understaffing at their stores in the past three months and that these staffing issues resulted in longer wait times for customers.

The baristas’ survey findings were confirmed by a Nielsen survey among 3,000 Starbucks customers in August and reported by the SOC. About one-third of customers said they’d had a negative Starbucks experience, with long-wait times in-store and at the drive-thru being the chief issue. In particular, more than three in four Starbucks customers who reported issues said that long wait times have remained the same or worsened since the spring of 2025

Obviously, the kind of turnaround that CEO Niccol is tasked with accomplishing will take some time, possibly years, but the pressure is on. To do it, he needs both his employees and customers on his side.

Negative publicity from a strike could make matters worse, despite company assurances that the union’s plans will not disrupt the vast majority of company-owned and licensed stores over the holiday season.

Pressure Building

Starbucks says it is ready to talk as soon as the union is ready to return to the negotiating table. That the contract dispute has extended into this holiday season is regrettable for all parties, especially after the previous CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, had promised to finalize a contract agreement by the end of 2024.

That deadline went out the window after Niccol joined the company last September. Since then, the union-company relationship seems to have become more contentious.

“It’s not been a banner a year for the reputation of Starbucks – the continuation of a negative news cycle will further erode pervasive feelings of trust and benefit of doubt associated with Starbucks,” shared RepTrak’s Hahn.

Sensing that Starbucks’ corporate sentiment is more Scrooge-like ‘bah humbug’ than holiday cheer and well wishes, he said, “If at all possible, it would seem to be in the best interests of Starbucks management to reach an amicable, expedient, and mutually beneficial settlement with the Starbucks United Workers.

“It’s time for Starbucks to put all the unfavorable news coverage behind it – and to get back to fulfilling its mission – in bringing people together and nurturing the human spirit, one cup of coffee at a time.”
