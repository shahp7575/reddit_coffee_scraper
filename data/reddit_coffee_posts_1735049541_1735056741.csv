To be clear my mom is still living independently. We haven‚Äôt taken away her keys yet, but that‚Äôs definitely on the horizon. She has urinary incontinence but that‚Äôs been well-managed with pads and my mother is usually aware enough to get to the bathroom in time. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with my mom pretty much solo for about 14 years. My sister has recently started to get more involved, and generously offered to take her on for the holidays. My sister is newly-married, and this is my mom‚Äôs first visit to the in-law‚Äôs house. Things had been going okay minus some kooky/rude but harmless things‚Äî walking into bedrooms at night where people are sleeping to ask if they‚Äôre awake, sitting at the table and helping herself to food before anyone else gets to the dining room, etc.

Last night apparently my mom had diarrhea. She shit from her bed all the way to the en suite bathroom, all over the floor (of course with cream-colored carpet). My mom didn‚Äôt attempt to clean it up and didn‚Äôt say anything to anyone about the mess. Everyone had breakfast and coffee this morning, a leisurely Christmas Eve. My poor sister stumbled upon the scene‚Äî shit baked into the carpet, on some furniture etc. ‚Äîand is having an understandable meltdown. She‚Äôs so mortified and embarrassed. And from afar I‚Äôm so very sad, for my sister and my mom. I‚Äôm also worried this is going to seal the deal on my sister continuing to not be involved. I don‚Äôt need advice, just needed a rant.

I also have to feed the drugged out cat wet food throughout the day. Anyway, I have a guilt free excuse to stay home for the holiday. Already drinking coffee and farming on my blizz sorc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even totally understand why I love this game so much, I‚Äôm a returning player with an 89 hammerdin and an 89 sorc (Javazon next). I played when I was 12 and online people gave me good gear for free. I am playing offline and have acquired a ton of the cool items thanks to advice from this sub. 

I want to return the favor by spreading holiday joy and laughs with an interactive post. We obviously enjoy this game because it‚Äôs repetitive and includes routine. One exception to this is the randomly generated names of unique enemies. They combine words of phrases. Today I saw a cool one called Shadow Vex. It made me remember the funniest one I‚Äôve ever seen, Foul Eater. Like dude you eat shit? That is actually pretty hardcore for a zombie‚Ä¶ to my surprise, I saw foul eater a few minutes later in the ancient tunnels ü§£

Here is the interactive part:

1) See any cool names like shadow vex?

2) Have you seen any funny ones like foul eater? 

Since the game is so repetitive, I have been paying more attention to these names as something to think about while farming. An extra layer I appreciate about these observations are the enemy type and occasionally the color of the unique enemy. Like I remember the first time I saw fouler eater he was a green zombie in Andariel‚Äôs throne room. Pretty hard to forget.

I‚Äôve created a fun and exciting subreddit game called **IMAGE EXPRESSIONS**, celebrating the Sebongs' most iconic faces!  

---

### How it works:  
1. The game will run for **13 days**, with each day dedicated to one member.  
2. Your task:  
   - **Submit an image** of the member that best matches the day‚Äôs expression in the comments.  
   - If someone has already posted an image you love, simply **upvote** it instead of posting a similar one.  
3. To keep it fair and fun, please submit **only one image per user for each expression**.  

---

### A few tips:  
- Choose your images wisely! If you think a member fits a different expression better on another day, save their image for that round.  
- Famous memes are welcome, but make sure the focus is on the specific member for that day.  
- Keep all submissions fun, appropriate, and positive!  


I hope the rules are simple enough to follow. Let‚Äôs make this a fun and memorable event for all!

Is Breville Precision brewer a good upgrade to it, and to use alongside an aeropress for days I‚Äôm feeling lazy.

My main question is, how easy/accessible is it to use for people who might not care to measure the correct amounts of coffee and water ratio. 

And also how long does it take from wanting a coffee, to having a coffee in front of me. 
As whilst I love the aeropress and the coffee it makes, it‚Äôs not the fastest procedure. I want something that‚Äôs a lot nicer than a coffee pod machine. But also very easy and convenient for people to use. 

And finally how much ground coffee it take for a full tank. As I only have a small hand grinder which can grind up to 20g at a time, would you recommend I buy ground coffee rather than beans, or just get a bigger grinder?

1hlgc2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/blur/comments/1hlgc2s/13_is_a_masterpiece/,13 is a masterpiece!,"I know it has been said before, especially on this sub, but I have to say it again. I don't like to listen to it every day cause I don't want to get bored of it (so every 10 days or so is okay lmao), but today was that day, it's snowing outside and I'm a bit gloomy.

Anyway, what a ride! I'm going to go through every song and give my impression, feel free to discuss and share your opinions!

1. Tender - An anthem of love. Damon is so heartbroken, but he still has hope that he'll find love again. I prefer the live version though, cause Damon really gives it all and it's one of my favourite vocal performances from him. Beautiful, calm, yet theatrical and uplifting beginning of the album.

2. Bugman - a bit more insane, cause the drugs come into the whole story. Damon describes going out in the city and having a sort of crisis, maybe because of his addiction, but I'd say it's an existential crisis. The whole song feels like it's on a verge of insanity and panic attack.

3. Coffee & TV - Graham's song about his alcohol addiction. He really shines, and we again get a calmer song, which hints the album's dynamics afterwards (the calm-chaotic pattern). It's more pop, but we can still hear Graham's well known guitar sound, which adds an uneasy feeling to the song that's sounds very calm at first.

4. Swamp Song - the most insane song on the album imo. Damon screams (quite literally) about insanity caused by his addiction (""stick it in my veins""). He sounds like he has nowhere to go and is in a very dark place of hopelessness. His scream, especially live, is so haunting, like he finally lets go of all the emotions and frustration that's been building up.

5. 1992 - another song about heartbreak. Damon's feeling of loneliness is more calm and isolated. The song has such a great outro, again calm but it also gives a kind of claustrophobic vibe overall.

6. B.L.U.R.E.M.I. - another insane song that has the vibe of their earlier stuff, only in the manner of this album. Again, it can be about addiction if we're looking at the album as a whole, cause we have a major blast of energy after a sad song. Also, the hidden track again impies that, cause after the chaos, Damon is again lonely and numb.

7. Battle - an experimental masterpiece. The song's lyrics are quite confusing, but I'd say it's about fighting the addiction and trying to wake up from it all. It starts slowly, but as it progresses, it goes more insane. Damon's vocals, again, sound so hopeless, like he's literally fighting for life. And Alex really shines in this one!

8. Mellow Song - another calm song. Damon sings about addiction in a very poetic way (""shooting stars in my left arm""), while also realising that his time is passing in this state of desperation. He has no idea how he'll end up, has no idea if he'll soon be gone or if he'll get better.

9. Trailerpark - this song gives me the vibe of giving up and going out while high in a way, cause of the slowbeat tempo. It really sounds like a trip. The outro is great!

10. Caramel - blimey, I could write a whole essay about this one. The best song Blur has ever written. The intro and the outro complement each other, so we get a full circled composition. It may be a bit far-fetched, but the intro (and outro) instrumental really reminds me of a funeral. Then we get Damon's vocals, and he sounds so numb and beaten up in a way. He decided that he has to get better (maybe an answer to the dilema of Mellow Song), but he doesn't have the strength, as vocals inside his head (Graham's backing vocals) keep reminding him about heroin. He then snaps and goes into insanity, which is musically wonderfully done. Every instrument just crashes while Damon is giving his all to cope with it, but he can't, that's why his falsetto sounds so desperate. And in the end he gives up, he can't get better, he has hit the bottom and is hopeless in every way. The first hidden track adds to that numbness after the chaos, but the second hidden track tells us that he goes and plans to get high again (it sounds very urban and I associate it with going in the city to get high/drunk to get away from it all).

11. Trimm Trabb - Literally about going out in the city lmao. Damon realises he's alone and he's just another guy (he calls them losers, but he identifies with them). He doesn't think highly of him anymore, he's a shell, which is a bit of an irony cause the instrumental is so cool, even though he doesn't feel good about himself anymore. The song ends with total chaos and screaming again, implying that he snapped yet again and can't take it all anymore - the addiction, the heartbreak, loneliness and sadness.

12. No Distance Left To Run - the calm after the storm. This is him facing it all, he is fucked up and heartbroken, but he is not bitter in any way anymore. He wants Justine to find someone better, cause he realised that he wasn't good enough. And while Tender gave a more optimistic tone, this one is really sad. It's about realisation of all the things Damon lost and giving up on his selfishness. Through the whole album he was self-pitying in a way, trying to find answers and to fight his demons. Now he's given up, he doesn't care about him anymore cause it's hopeless, but he wants her to be happy away from him.

13. Optigan 1 - an instrumental epilogue. This is all that is left, he's been through hell and he can't fight anymore. It's calm and soothing, it can be interpreted as finally reaching inner peace with the past realisations, or death as the consequence of everything.

I know this is a long post (sorry about that), but feel free to discuss the album! Of course, I focused primarily on Damon and his lyrics, but every member of Blur gave their best here. They were all in a bad place and I think this is their most honest album, and that's why it's such a masterpiece!",9,1735055690.0,blur,2,1.0,False

Understanding the Causes of Tooth Discoloration and Prevention Tips
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tooth discoloration is a common concern that many people face. Understanding the causes of discolored teeth is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. Some of the primary reasons for discoloration include dietary choices, lifestyle habits, and certain medical conditions. When you grasp these underlying causes, you can better manage the appearance of your smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Dietary Choices and Their Impact

Your diet plays a significant role in the color of your teeth. Foods and drinks that are high in pigments can lead to staining. Here are some common culprits:

- **Coffee and Tea:** Both beverages contain tannins that can cause yellowing.
- **Red Wine:** The deep color of red wine can leave stains on your enamel.
- **Berries:** Fruits like blueberries and blackberries can impact tooth color due to their natural pigments.
- **Sauces:** Condiments and sauces such as soy sauce, curry, or tomato sauce are notorious for staining teeth.

To mitigate these effects, drink plenty of water after consuming staining foods and beverages. Additionally, try to use a straw when drinking colored liquids to minimize contact with your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Lifestyle Habits to Consider

Your daily habits can either maintain the brightness of your smile or contribute to discoloration:

- **Smoking:** Tobacco not only leads to yellow teeth but can also result in unsightly brown stains.
- **Oral Hygiene:** Neglecting to brush and floss regularly allows plaque to build up, leading to discoloration.
- **Dry Mouth:** Saliva helps wash away food particles and bacteria. A lack of it can lead to staining over time.

To combat these risks, consider quitting smoking and committing to a robust oral hygiene routine. Ensure you brush at least twice a day and floss daily to keep your teeth bright.

### Medical Conditions and Discoloration

Certain health issues can affect the color of your teeth. Some conditions that may lead to discoloration include:

- **Fluorosis:** Excessive fluoride intake during childhood can lead to white spots or discoloration on the enamel.
- **Medications:** Some antibiotics, like tetracycline, can cause stains if given to children during tooth development.
- **Genetics:** Some people are naturally predisposed to have teeth that are more prone to discoloration.

If you suspect that a medical condition is affecting your tooth color, consult with your dentist for advice and treatment options.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Prevention Tips for Maintaining White Teeth

Taking a proactive approach can help you maintain your teeth‚Äôs natural whiteness:

1. **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Schedule visits to your dentist at least twice a year for cleanings and check-ups.
2. **Use a Straw:** When drinking beverages that can stain, use a straw to reduce contact with your teeth.
3. **Whitening Toothpaste:** Consider using a whitening toothpaste to help combat stains and maintain brightness.
4. **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:** While it's tough to stop enjoying your favorite foods and drinks, limiting their frequency can help.

By understanding the causes of tooth discoloration, you can take steps to prevent it. Being mindful of your dietary choices, practicing good oral hygiene, and addressing any medical issues will all contribute to healthier teeth. Your smile is your signature, and taking care of it is crucial for your confidence and overall health.

### Conclusion

Fixing a discolored tooth at home can be both effective and economical when you understand the right approaches. Utilizing home remedies such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and apple cider vinegar can help whiten your tooth, but it's crucial to use them responsibly and in moderation. These simple techniques can enhance the aesthetics of your smile by targeting surface stains without professional dental treatment.

Knowing the causes of tooth discoloration is equally important. Factors like poor oral hygiene, consumption of certain foods and beverages, and tobacco usage can all contribute to the dulling of your pearly whites. By being proactive and adopting preventive tips such as regular brushing, flossing, and limiting stain-causing drinks, you can maintain a bright, healthy smile. Additionally, routine dental check-ups can help catch potential issues before they lead to more significant discoloration.

While home remedies are a great starting point, understanding that not all discoloration can be resolved without professional help is essential. If you find that at-home solutions aren‚Äôt giving you the results you desire, visiting a dentist for professional treatment may be the best course of action. Your smile deserves the best care possible, and combining home remedies with preventive practices will keep your teeth looking their best. Embrace the tips and strategies discussed, and enjoy the confidence that comes from a brighter smile!

1hlga0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1hlga0w/hello_i_wrote_this_post_anonymously_on_a_forum_i/,"Hello. I wrote this post anonymously on a forum. I wonder if anybody could help me figure out if my relative's behavior fits in also with schizoaffective, apart from CPTSD.","Sorry if this is rather long-winded, inarticulate, and meandering, I am not thinking straight...

This is a post about my brother who is suffering from C-PTSD, on top of depression and anxiety. Me and my mother are currently hopeless, and do not know how things will end.  
  
He is currently having another ""rage episode"" for lack of a better term, intimidating and cursing at my mother at random times (though mostly quiet in his room).  
  
Today, he removed my mother's TV from the living room, so she has nothing to do all day, except go about her chores in fear. He told her to ""watch out"" after some village officials came to our home to speak with him (due to the commotion), which only further fueled his rage at her. Unfortunately, these officials can't do anything and don't seem to care or understand.  
  
Yesterday, my brother was pounding things and occasionally shouting in his room like a maniac. My mother thinks this is triggered by the fact that my other sibling will be returning home next year, whereas my brother was not allowed two years ago and had to plead with us (he was staying at our dad's family in the US and was there to work), which I think was a sensible decision on our part because he was in a hyper-aggressive/-volatile state back then, so we did it out of fear, considering that we are only two women.  

Basically, he is angry at what he calls ""the double standard."" 
  
Of course, this triggered some abandonment/rejection issues in him. Because when he was a child, my parents had to work abroad, and he was sent off to my grandmother here I think at age 6, resulting I guess in culture shock/alienation/estrangement, and a sense of abandonment (since he had to be separated from my mother for a few years). I would like to mention that he stopped therapy months ago, and I don't think he's taking his meds.  
  
Ever since he came home this year, my mother had to play along every single day, and wrack her brains trying to guess what she should do to keep him happy, or at least stable, because otherwise, he would just self-isolate in his room all day and not say anything.  
  
What do you do when you have an almost-30 child who does not want to help himself, to the point of just lying around all day doing nothing for a year, and yet curses/verbally abuses you for ""making him the way he is,"" despite making every attempt to help him? It's an endless cycle  
  
My mother would do everything for him, cook for him, drive him wherever, socialize with him (he doesn't have any friends), send him to the most expensive therapist, whatever... she's been doing this for a year, and yet this is the culmination...  
  
His rages are usually on-and-off, so we've gotten used to the pattern this year. When it is ""off,"" he and my mother are like best friends, playfully chatting and joking around, which is why we held out hope of him getting better, but now that the year is closing, we're at a lost.  
  
Yesterday, my mother slept with me in my room, and when he climbed up the stairs on his way to us, I did not know what was going to happen... Maybe I'm catastrophizing, but the quiet rage in his face made me think he was about to kill us, despite the fact that so far this year or ever, no physical violence has occurred.  
  
My mother also told me about his mind-games as in ""loyalty tests"", which she said was already something he did even as a kid, before he was abandoned. I do not really know how to account for it. When he was a kid, he would command my mother to do things, otherwise all hell breaks loose and he would break into a tantrum. It could be something as little as him not wanting her to wear a hairclip, or not wanting her to sit with my dad.  
  
Recently, this happened again. While they were at the mall, my mother managed to ""wean"" him off for an hour, that is, let him roam by himself, which ever since he came home, he barely ever did due to his anxiety. When they met up again after an hour, my mother wanted to buy some pastries at a shop nearby, and so told him to just meet her there while he ate at a restaurant.  
  
Apparently, this was cause for another rage attack. It is possible other things happened that day, like maybe my mother did not give him enough money (which I know he does not like). This rage manifested as him cursing in public and throwing the pastry package to the ground.  
  
After my mother brought him to a nearby coffee shop to calm him down, he commanded her that they will re-visit every single shop they went to at the mall, I guess to ""punish"" her and prove her loyalty, or something.  
  
Because of this, they arrived home late that day. It is just impossible to know what will trigger him.Pre-COVID, my brother was actually taking meds and was at his very best, but when he turned 25 he realized he had to start his life, and that's when he relapsed into darkness. And then the US happened, life didn't turn out as planned, etc. and now here he is.  
  
My mother doesn't know what to do anymore. I am not kidding when I say she is the most indefatigable person I know, even to an unusual degree, and yet right now she is breaking down and seems like she just wants to end it all. She has no escape, and she knows it is possible that she will be spending the rest of her days being psychologically abused by her son. I don't know how to help her.  
  
The only way I've been coping this year has been by way of making these type of venting posts, but they just end up getting ignored. I have no access to a psychiatrist to help me figure this out either. My other sibling is unresponsive. I don't. know. what. to. do.  
  
It is frightening to see someone just all of a sudden lose all empathy, because I don't know how or when it will all end. Right now, me and my mother are in our rooms, not knowing what to expect. Obviously, my brother down below is still seething. I don't know what he's going to do later... probably verbally abuse and intimidate my mom again...  
  
Obviously, this will be our worst Christmas. We can't even watch TV. For my part, I have two more years before I graduate. I just want to get my life started. I don't want anything traumatizing to stop my life.  
  
Guess I'm looking for advice/support/info about whether people like my brother get violent? How far would they go? Should I fear for our life? What can be done? What is the prognosis for CPTSD? How can I help my mother? I don't want her to spend the rest of her days slaving away in fear. How to cope? What to do...",1,1735055525.0,schizoaffective,0,1.0,False

1hlg902,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vasectomy/comments/1hlg902/five_days_post_vasectomy/,Five Days Post Vasectomy,"32 years old, got my vasectomy on Friday. Went to the urology clinic of a large medical center. Got a ride and took Valium an hour before my appointment. Valium didn‚Äôt hit me until they called my name to go back, but I definitely felt more relaxed and care-free. 

I didn‚Äôt research the types of procedures before I scheduled. This one was the scalpel and snip method. Nurse assured me it was the best method. I asked her about other places that do it and if I should have gone to a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù, or one of those guys that does it out of a solo office. Really I was just trying to convince myself that I made the right choice of doctor. She again assured me that they are specialist. I was their fourth appointment today. 

Doc came in to get started. They kept me very calm with normal conversation and jokes. The worst part was the needle for the numbing medicine. It felt like they went into the top/side of the scrotum near the base of the penis. It hurt, then as the medicine was being injected it hurt more, it felt like he shoved the entire needle from one side of my sack to the other. Nurse checked in on me as I was clenching the bed. It hurt, but nothing I can‚Äôt handle. More of a sharp intense pain that went away quickly as the medicine took effect. Not as painful, shocking or lingering as a wack to the nuts. 6/10 pain. 

They started tug and pull a little as the procedure continued. I could imagine what they were doing, but didn‚Äôt know forsure. Minor discomfort, it felt as if he was doing all the work from the right side only, only later to discover two incisions. Before I realized what was happening, he was already stitching me up. They had cut an inch of vas deferen from each side. Stitched the top and bottom of each vas, then stitched the incisions. They also let me take a picture of the tubes they cut out, which was cool. 

Total I was in and out of the doctor‚Äôs office in an hour. Felt fine walking back to the car. Took some ibuprofen when I got home. The doctor suggested I do not take Advil as it could make the bleeding worse. I iced immediately, on and off all day along with a schedule of ibuprofen. I had prepared with a jock strap and some tight briefs. Never touched the jock as the briefs kept everything in place nicely. The bag of peas worked perfect, it was the right temperature, shape and consistency. Most of the lingering pain was on my left side near the testicle. I lounged on the couch all day. I slept with a pillow between my legs and an actual jell ice pack for the night, as I am typically a side sleeper or a stomach sleeper. Daily pain 4/10

Day two was worse, but better than expected. The pain was mostly on the right side. I woke up and went right back to the couch after making my coffee. Back to the ice and ibuprofen regiment. I had foolishly scheduled to go pick up a Facebook marketplace purchase around noon. I was able to make it out of the house, into the car, 1hr round trip and home without any issues, all though it probably wasn‚Äôt the wisest decision. Took a shower today as well, no issues. Daily pain 4/10

Day three, similar pain and discomfort as day two. The pain has moved up into my pelvic region, almost as if someone was tugging on the right side of my nut sack. Lounged and iced all day. Had to run to the post office, no issues. Daily pain 3/10

Day four, less ice because I kept forgetting, or was busy milling around the house doing things. Iced periodically when needed. Probably every three hours I was like ‚Äúouch‚Äù and wanted to relax with some ice for thirty minutes. During my shower today I realized that the upper right side of my scrotum and the right side of my penis was purple like a nasty bruise. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs normal, and just a minor hematoma that will clear on its own. Daily pain 2/10. 

Day five. Traveling six hours for Christmas today. I took  ibuprofen, no ice. Sitting is just fine, which has been the hardest thing to do so far. Laying down was always the most comfortable. Standing up and loading stuff into the car was uncomfortable, but after walking a few dozen steps, I was fine. Daily pain 2/10

I work construction, walking over 10,000 steps a day and regularly lifting very heavy items, contorting my body in awkward positions, running chain falls, pushing heavy carts, climbing ladders. I don‚Äôt think I would want to go back to work on Monday if I got this done on a Friday. I‚Äôm sure if you worked an office job, you could handle it. Maybe have some ice packs at work to make yourself more comfortable. Fortunately I planned ahead and scheduled my procedure when I did. I don‚Äôt have to go back to work until the 30th, 10 full days after the procedure. Hopefully I feel good enough to continue regular activities. 

I‚Äôm happy I got it done. I‚Äôm happy with how recovery is going. I‚Äôm happy with the type of snip I got done. No regrets so far. ",1,1735055440.0,Vasectomy,0,1.0,False

I had been a tough year or so. I lost my dad and both my grandmas in the span of 8 months. I had a toddler and a baby, the baby was not sleeping through the night, then he also started waiking up at 4 am every day, and all of this was draining me to the point of exhaustion and desperation. My partner was constantly irritated that I'm not coping, that the house is a mess, the kids are misbehaving and that I'm an emotional mess. I begged him for help multiple times and he kept repeating ""How would you expect me to help you when you behave the way you are behaving?"". He even denied when I asked him to let me go alone to the funerals of my grandmas - I didn't want the noise and business of having to care for the children, I wanted a quiet day with my extended family to mourn the loss of our loved one. But he insisted he and the kids also come because he didn't want to be left to care alone for them for a day and a half until I return.

Last year we spent Christmas Eve with his family and on Christmas day we were travelling to my family. The kids fell asleep in the car and I told him that our daugther had made a Christmas card for one of my grandmas, I got upset and started crying. He then responded with ""Oh come on, stop with the drama, you are making me feel like I'm going to a funeral and not a selebration"".

And this was that ""aha"" moment when I knew in my heart that this was not the person I wanted to spend my life with. I right there and then took the decision that this will be the last Christmas I will be spending with him.

It did take me a little time to gather up the courage and tell him but I eventually did in February, then we went back and forth for a few months discussing if we will try councelling or not, but he ended up with a new girlfriend and moved out in July. I know I let him linger for too long but I wanted to be a bigger person and let him figure out what he's going to do and where he'll live when he moves out.

Since then, he's proven a million times I took the right decision. He ""punishes"" me by not seeing the kids for weeks at a time. He even said he doesn't want to see them ""until he figures things out"" after out 4-year-old daugther spilled juice on his girfriend's purse and refused to apologise. He didn't attend our son's birthday because he was invited to his girfriend's mom's birthday at the same time and choose to go there. He gives priority to all other kinds of stuff over the kids. He got sick right before Christmas so I told him he can't have the kids now but as a compensation, he can have them between 1st and 5th Jan - and his immediate response was ""well, I will be working on 2nd and 3rd"". I will too but there is also kindergarten, dude!

Today we travelled to my mom's and I was reminded once again how much better and more calm my life is without him. He would always get nervous and we'd end up figthing before travelling because we were not getting ready quickly enough and we were not in the car and ready to go by some imaginary deadline he'd set for himself. Today we just left when we were ready, we stopped for coffee and a snack, we listened to music in the car...

I am reminded daily how much better my life is that is not it in any more (except for communication about the kids, which is still a struggle). I am grateful that he choose to be such a d\*\*\*head to me because I obvously just needed a little nudge to do what's best for us.",1,1735055358.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

# Aboard the Pax Vindicator

Kyra Venh was a very good pilot, which was the entire reason she was on this state-of-the-art smuggling corvette turned biolab after all.  That, and a few poor decisions that essentially made returning home to the CIP out of the question for a good long while.  Really, just a little cocaine smuggling along with her actual job shouldn't have been such a big deal, but Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service on Albian Centauri disagreed.  It wasn't like a couple hours of detox and a week in rehab ever did anyone any real harm.  However, that royal pain in semi-honest businesswomen's asses had enough clout to make sure she wasn't safe across the whole coalition.  Sure, she was able to keep moving product on her own in a personal ship for a while, especially with the authorities focused on bigger problems, but without the legitimacy of flying for disaster relief, said authorities were getting closer and closer to hemming her in.  In comes a biologist from Pacifia with a job offer.  What could be a safer way to lay low than to fly a pacifist biologist around terraforming candidates?  These days trouble with the authorities wasn't so scary.  Dr. Persephone Morn wasn't so pacifistic as her countrymen anymore.

Dr. Morn's ""work"" had taken Kyra extremely far from nice, safe, empty planets in need of evaluation for future terraforming, and extremely close to the bigger problems that had taken up so much of the authorities' focus.  That problem being, of course, the ongoing war with the insane genocidal Dominion of Axxaakk.  Most people got their name wrong on purpose, but Dr. Morn had ruthlessly squashed that practice.  She called it ""looking at evil without flinching,"" but Kyra thought she didn't want anyone treating the Axxaakk with any humor in any way.  The good doctor had her reasons for that.  Any Pacifian would have reasons to want the Axxaakk taken seriously.

""Maintain orbit,"" Dr. Morn was saying softly as Kyra eased the yolk to make tiny adjustments in the ship's orbital trajectory, ""I need to be sure the deployment was successful.""

""The canisters landed in a huge farms and their tractors won't find them for like six weeks, if then.  Didn't you say they're a couple months away from harvest?""

""I said they're most likely two to three months away from optimal harvest time.  However, they might cut the grain early to ship it under ripe and ripen it via exposure to a catalyst upon arrival for processing.  More importantly, I need to know whether and how many delivery devices failed.""

Kyra adjusted the orbital path again to avoid a derelict satellite and said, ""The longer we stay here the more likely they are to notice we're not bumping into their orbital debris‚Ä¶""

""I realize that, Ms. Venh, but I require confirmation.  If you believe we are detected, please utilize your skills to make good our escape,"" Dr. Morn explained as Kyra glanced at her reflection.  Kyra thought that the dim glow cast by the various displays into the shadows of the cockpit gave her employer a sinister cast.

""It's not like we're sticking around to watch your‚Ä¶ your‚Ä¶ *creation* take effect,"" Kyra said, ""all we're getting is a signal from each canister, and for all we know that could have malfunctioned.""

""No, we are not waiting for Bloodblight to fully blossom, and we know that the deployment detection systems are resilient enough that malfunctions will be unlikely.  We'll perhaps never know for sure if we succeeded in removing an enemy agri-world, or perhaps we shall find out after the war,"" Dr. Morn was saying while Kyra quite involuntarily noticed her employer's eyes tighten at the corners and her mouth twitch upward in the reflection on one of the viewscreens in the cockpit.  ""Maybe we'll read their records of massive crop failures, inability to properly feed their slaves, and a noticeable drop in production of war materials at several of their industrial worlds.  Maybe we'll even read about what alternative food sources they resort to, local pests or vermin, perhaps just like the ancient Soviets, they shall turn to one another for vital calories.  Perhaps we'll never know for certain, but if I have confirmation of deployment, I shall be able to infer success.""

""You're talking about starving an entire planet.""

""No,"" interrupted the resident Digitan, L4m14, via speakers for her use, ""she's talking about starving several planets.  Just got pings from all sixty canisters, boss-lady.""

""Doctor,"" Dr. Morn corrected coolly.

""Sorry, doctor boss-lady,"" the feminine Digitan chirped cheerily, ""Anyway, it's a widely believed fact that an army marches on its stomach, so taking away their food will mean they can't march.  I'm not sure how that would help anything, since I'm pretty sure you can't march with internal organs and nobody marches in space anyhow, but organics are weird.""

""Those sub-sapient *creatures* systematically slaughtered every last man and woman on Second Chance, and they would have murdered the children too if they could.  They have proven as much on several planets.  Do you believe creatures capable of such an act should be left to persist in slaughter?""  As she was speaking, Dr. Morn began unconsciously tapping her foot, and her voice took on a cool hard quality that Kyra could only notice due to her familiarity with Dr. Morn.  Kyra thought there was hot hatred beneath that icy exterior, and had no desire to break through.

""No.  They need stopping, I won't argue with that,"" Kyra said quickly.

An alarm chimed, a display flashed, and Lam14 helpfully said, ""Four incoming patrol vessels, I'd say they're roughly equivalent to light system watch vessels, or maybe tugs with guns if we're comparing them to Republic of Terra vessels.  I know you're a CIPpie, but there's not a lot of standardization in the Coalition.""

""If you don‚Äôt mind Doctor, I think I'll get us out of here before we get caught.""

""Please do, begin our course to the fallback point and come to the dining room once you've made translation.  We shall discuss the available options for our next target then.""

""Mess it's called the mess,"" Kyra grumbled under her breath as her employer got out of her way so she could do her job.

When the *Pax Vindicator* was safely in hyperspace, Kyra stood up from the pilot's seat and stretched.  She only reveled in the satisfying way the popping sensations ran up her spin for a few seconds, and started making her way to the mess as requested.  The clean, smoothly paneled corridor was well lit, and gave the illusion of being in a nice building rather than a ship, probably because the previous owners wanted to smuggle in comfort.  They made Kyra feel as if she was in a clinic rather than at home in a ship.  Dr. Morn never gave orders, she merely requested certain actions be taken, and those requests were simply fulfilled.  Well, unless someone had a good reason the request could not be fulfilled and could explain it, and they'd better not waste any time in explaining it.

Dr. Morn and Thalys Grae were already seated at the elliptical table cleverly bolted to the deck.  Thylys was half-lounging on the cushioned seating built into the wall in his customary comfortable looking sweats while Dr. Morn sat rigidly in one of the two chairs opposite from the bench, and the pair were already eating what Thalys alleged was nearly as good as authentic Italian cooking.  Kyra realized she was starving, and even if she had no clue how close this pasta was to authentic Italian, it smelled heavenly.

""L4m14, are you available for a staff meeting?"" Dr. Morn asked the air.

""Sure thing, doctor boss-lady.  Point of order, please hire an engineer, you organics are surprisingly good at ship maintenance and emergency repair.""

""That course of action remains under consideration,"" Dr. Lumia answered, ""In the meantime please make use of Mr. Grae's assistance and the robotic frame.""

""Okie-dokie.  Just bear in mind that the lack of an engineer is a strategic weakness in your mission, and there is only so much I can do with systems management.""

""I continue to note your advice, could you please load the file 'Population Dense Targets' for me on a holographic display?""

Kyra was busy dishing up as much pasta her bowl could hold as the display flickered to life above the table, and she felt obliged to scoot her meal out of a translucent moon.  ""I guess you're going to ask me what kind of samples I can get you from these kinds of targets?"" Thalys asked as he used his pasta laden fork to call up a text description on one of the holographic planets.

""Indeed, Mr. Grae.  Again, if you can obtain samples of existing pathogens on the planet in addition to samples of blood and hair from the population, that would be ideal.  Fungal samples could also be useful, as well as samples of the local drinking water and food stores.""

""What's our focus?"" the squat, gruff man asked as his eyes scanned the text.

""Disruption of industrial capacity.  This can be accomplished via either disabling the production equipment or disabling the labor force, ideally I would like to achieve both in tandem.""

""Do you have what you need to engineer an organism to damage infrastructure aboard?"" Kyra asked after making absolutely certain there was no food in her mouth.

""Potentially.  It depends on what Mr. Grae is able to find on the planet we select.""

""Speaking of,"" Kyra mused, ""A planet full of industrial parks isn't going to be as easy to sneak around as a planet covered in farmland.""

""Indeed, Mr. Grae, do you feel confident in your abilities to infiltrate one of these targets?""

""Generally, yes.  So long as I don't need to actually interract with the locals, I should be fine.  The missionaries describe these places as half abandoned.  Lots of hiding places and ways to get around unseen in the lower levels.  Nothing jumps out to me as any easier than the rest, so the choice is probably gonna be up to whichever one you can sneak us close to,"" Thalys said to Kyra soberly.

She nodded and aggressively spun pasta around her fork, ""I'll need a couple of hours to study what you have on that.  It's probably all wrong again, but maybe it'll help me predict where and how they reinforced.""

Dr. Morn nodded and asked, ""Do we have any further concerns?""

""Supply,"" Kyra said instantly.  ""We have maybe another month's worth of fresh food aboard, and if we can't find another ice body soon water will start becoming a problem.  Then there's fuel, most of the viable gas giants behind enemy lines are just as valuable to them as they'd be to us.  More, since they're in a war against the Republic and the CIP and probably all the xenos too, and we're only one ship.""

""I suggest you plan our escape rout from whichever target you choose with resupply in mind,"" Dr. Morn said at length.  ""Now if you don't mind, I shall take the rest of my meal in my lab and begin some preliminary analysis.""

""Please add an engineer to your supply list,"" L4m14 chimed, ""It would suck if the ship got a reactor leak I couldn't fix and you all died since then the radiation would slowly corrupt my files, and that would mean I'm alone and crazy when I died which doesn't sound fun.""

""You have made your point Lamia,"" Dr. Morn said as she got up, ""and I will see if we can find an engineer available for our kind of work.""

""So, you think you can get me in?""

""Like I said, Thalys, I have to look over the data and then make my best guess about what holes in their security they've plugged.""

""Oh, so it's that you're worried about whether you can do the job?  Maybe you don't have what it takes to outfly these half-blind arrogant fools?""

""As apposed to?""

""Second thoughts.""

Kyra tapped her fork on the edge of her bowl and said, ""It started with contaminating one of their big lubricant sources.""

""Which is a bigger deal than most organics realize,"" L4m14 agreed cheerfully, ""ships and weapons have tons of moving parts that can break if not properly lubricated.""

""Yes, I agree.  Then we gave a couple of planets the sniffles.""

""Which lead to a supply shortage on the front that translated to dead Axxaakk,"" Thalys observed.

""Yeah, but now we're starving entire planets.""

""Yes, and?""

""I don't know, maybe we shouldn't starve billions of beings to death on purpose?""

""Hey Lamia, could you please pull up the latest posts in the Republican SAR Corps please?  The ones from that camp they found on that Clans planet?""

""Sure thing, buddy!"" she replied as the holographic display of potential targets was wiped away and replaced by a facsimile of a screen on which a video played.  It was obviously a feed from a helmet cam from how the view jostled and shifted from moment to moment.  The person who had recorded it was muttering a string of Catholic prayers as he swept his gaze across a scene of horrors.  The locals, a race of beetle-like people, were penned like animals, though any farmer would have balked at the conditions they were kept in.  The pens were choked with waste and corpses, the survivors were mutilated, and the purpose of the place was clear from the ichor covered sacrificial altar near the camp's center.

Kyra shut her eyes and said, ""I know, they have to be stopped.""

""Not just stopped, stopped forever.  And you know why I help the good doctor?  It's because the high-and-mighty, oh-so-moral Republic of Terra will eventually let those freaks surrender,"" Thalys punctuated his point by jabbing a fork full of twisted pasta at Kyra before continuing, ""They'll let the freaks have a second chance.  There's only one way to stop them forever.  Grow some backbone.""

""You ever been hungry, Thalys?""

""I can't get hungry!"" L4m14 very helpfully added.

""We know,"" Thalys said with an involuntary grin playing across his features for a brief moment.  ""I expect you mean more than have I ever wanted to hurry to my next meal?""

""Yeah, I mean like you ever had to make a loaf of bread or a half-rotten hunk of beef last a week or two?""

""No.  I expect nobody these days has gone through that.""

""As advanced as we are, all across Terran space, bad things still happen.  People still lose everything in fires, or storms, or quakes.  Ships still crash, stations still fail, and people fall through the cracks even in very wealthy systems with strong planets to support them,"" Kyra explained softly.

""I take it you were one of those fallen people?""

""Yup!"" L4m14 exclaimed, ""It was a whole big de-""

""Thank you,"" Kyra almost shouted over her digital crewmate's enthusiasm, ""but the point is I know what it's like to go hungry, and if I had to choose between dying in a battle and starving, I'd pick the bullet every single time.""

""And I'd agree with you,"" Thalys said easily as he spiraled his fork in his bowl, ""if we were talking about starving people.  Besides, our next target won't be starvation, the good doctor will come up with something quicker.""

""Exactly, since they're not Terrans, or allied with Terrans, and killing Terrans, who I like, they don't count as people, so it doesn't matter how they die!"" L4m14 agreed with chipper enthusiasm.

Kyra glanced toward the video being displayed and said, ""I'd like the targets back please.  I have a lot of work to do.""

""Okie-dokie,"" L4m14 said before rambling, ""Speaking of targeting, I think a new episode of One Piece just dropped.""

""I thought the pirates found the treasure island or whatever,"" Kyra said as her mind struggled to shift gears.

""Well duh,"" Thalys said in the superior tones of a nerd who watches a niche show, ""But then the original crew found another island with a portal to-""

""Well, if you weebs are going to nerd out,"" Kyra interrupted with all of the patience of someone who does not care about niche shows, ""I'm going to take my pasta to my room and go over this data in peace.""

""Sure thing, I'll send the files to your desk,"" L4m14 said as Kyra did just as she said she would.

""I should have the target picked before we're out of hyperspace,"" Kyra told Thalys.

One study and planning session, and a second trip through hyperspace later, and Kyra was imitating orbital debris entering the atmosphere of what Dr. Morn had called ""industrial target six,"" and was aiming for a section of the planet which was likely deserted for a landing.  Once again, she found herself wishing they could figure out how the Republic's scout's stealth drops worked.  From what a scan of the planet had revealed, debris crashing to the surface from orbit wasn't unusual, so the locals probably wouldn't glance twice at the *Pax Vindicator* until she could fly her below the planet's radar floor.  Hopefully nobody had noticed the scan, but then again, the Axxaakk ships and some of the derelicts in orbit were constantly sending out signals, so their scan was probably lost in the noise.  Even so, the cockpit was entirely silent.  In fact, other than Kyra herself, it was completely unoccupied.  Despite their inexperience with such things, they appreciated her vivid description of how difficult it was to make a ship appear to be another chunk of debris on uncontrolled entry while actually maintaining tight control, and just how horribly wrong such a maneuver can go.

Once they'd made it to the planet's surface, Kyra hovered until L4m14 let her know that Thalys and his vehicle were safely disembarked, and then she activated the ship's built in jamming equipment and hoped that nobody would be looking for a dead zone moving away from the planet in their sensors.  Most  authorities overlook that possibility, and likely this Dominion had very little of its own smuggling to worry about if what the Republic said about their culture was to be believed.  From what Thalys told her, Kyra could believe that everyone who needed a bit of extra food was too terrified to try their hand at her trade.  She didn't exactly like being grateful to the rulers for their brutality, but that did mean nobody was looking correctly as she escaped the planets gravity well and settled into orbit around a barren and unutilized planet in the system.

Then, so long as the local Axxaakk didn't suddenly realize that checking unoccupied bodies is how you make sure you don't have clandestine bioterrorists lurking around, her job was done for a week.  Even so, every day she awoke with the mantra, ""Complacency kills, kills you dead,"" and shrugged into her flight suit and blearily stumbled her way to the cockpit to review a report of the nights activity L4m14 had prepared for her, and then settled in to the riveting task of watching the target planet to make sure there wasn't a patrol headed their way.

""You know,"" L4m41 chipperly said by way of her usual greeting, ""I can totally do this for you and you can keep sleeping.""

""Sure, sure, and if you need my tallents you can totally wait half an hour for me to get my coffee and finish waking up.  Speaking of coffee‚Ä¶""

""I remembered,"" L4m14 said and caused the lights around the cockpit's coffee machine to flash in pattern.

""I don't care what the cops say, you're an angel, Lamia,"" Kyra nearly sang as she filled a spill-proof thermos tumbler with the black gold before adding an obscene amount of sugar and milk.

""My old ship had this really great espresso setup,"" the digital voice lamented, ""and a neat little robot arm I could use.  I got pretty good at making lattes.""

""Thalys might have an aneurysm if we put a robot arm in his domain.""

""If he didn't have good taste in anime, I'd resent him for not sharing.""

""There's no such thing as good taste in anime,"" Kyra teased as she sipped nectar of the gods.

L4m14 affected hurt and affronted as she replied in kind, ""Blasphemy!  How could you say such a thing about the highest art form?""

""Maybe I don't like looking at a show where only the main characters have interesting character designs and the rest of the screen filled with animated tits.""

""I'll have you know that Thalys and I only appreciate the finest of animated boobies,"" L4m14 replied haughtily.

""Speaking of Thalys, any word from him yet?""

""Yup.  Apparently he's found an absolute treasure trove of pathogens already, both viral and bacterial,"" L4m14 cheerily announced.

""Any chance we can pick him up early and retreat to give the good doctor a chance to work?""

""Maybe, he's started some cultures, but he wants to see about fungal opportunities.  His report says there's already a lot of illnesses around where he's collecting already, so the population already has poor immune systems.  Basically, there's a chance he'll want to get samples of everything he suspects if he can.""

""It's more important to be smooth than it is to be fast,"" Kyra reminded herself as she took another sip of heaven.

""Yup,"" L4m14 agreed, ""and smooth retrieval will mean more effective pathogens, which will mean we can more effectively take out this production center.""

""Pathogens?""

""Yeah, from the preliminary samples, it's looking like disabling the population will be the way to go this time,"" L4m14 told her cheerfully, ""especially since these Axxaakk are vulnerable to pathogens in the first place.""

Kyra fell silent and focused on the images from the extermination camp in her memory to remind herself who deserved what in this war.

And so the week proceeded.  Kyra made sure the enemy didn't know they were there, L4m14 maintained the ship's systems, and Dr. Morn began preparing to modify the pathogens being cultivated by Thalys on the ground.  Of course, there were those little moments of stand out events from the routine.  L4m14 needed assistance from Kyra to fix a leak in the air conditioning system, and Dr. Morn made another of her disastrous attempts at a casserole, for example.  But otherwise, the week seemed to slide by into the past with all of Kyra's other mistakes until she found herself imitating debris again.  This time with a different target in mind, and this time right under the belly of a patrol vessel to give herself the widest possible window of escape.  A week of watching the enemy had given her a pretty good understanding of their patrol pattern, after all.

Extraction went smooth, and so did leaving the system in favor of a star with a few useless planetoids in its orbit where Dr. Morn would be able to ply her talents without fear from the Axxaakk.  It was one load off of Kyra's shoulders, since the most dangerous part of the operation was behind them, at least the most dangerous part concerning her particular skills.  She suspected that even the slightest slip in the lab from either Dr. Morn or Thalys might kill them all, but Kyra tried not to worry overmuch about things outside her remit.  The less she knew about just how dangerous the pathogens were, the happier she'd have been.

However, Dr. Morn saw no reason to hide anything from her, and consequentially, progress of her work was a frequent topic of conversation.  Kyra didn't blame her though, because it wasn't as if she had much else to talk about.  ""Sample B forty-two shows promise,"" Thalys was saying, ""The models show it could severely weaken an Axxaakk for over a month if they're healthy, and the population at the target is anything but.""

""I'm leaning more toward sample G thirty-three,"" Dr. Morn replied with a flash of her eyes, ""the models show it has the potential to cause more damage over a shorter time frame.""

""It also shows that the spread will be limited since the host population is likely to die out before it spreads to another planet,"" L4m14 chimed in.

""Aren't we trying to disrupt their war effort in the widest way we can?"" Kyra asked as she tried to order her belly to stop turning summersault inside her.

""Certainly,"" Dr. Morn answered smoothly, ""but we are also experimenting.  A swift extermination reduces the chance of spreading, but also reduces the chance of the virus mutating to become less deadly, and reduces the chance of the Axxaakk developing countermeasures.  If we can confirm planetary effectiveness, we can begin to develop the pathogen for use across their blood-soaked empire.""

""And if they're all gone, they can't go around killing innocent kids for their insane god anymore,"" Thalys agreed before saying darkly, ""But if they do develop countermeasures, they'll have realized we're here.  Or that someone is attacking them the way we are.  It's one hell of a risk, Dr. Morn.""

""I like the ship I'm living on not being blown to bits and killing me and the organics I like,"" L4m14 said, ""but the fewer enemies there are, the more likely the war will be over soon, and the organics can go back to only fighting pirates and cartels and stuff like normal.""

""What you're talking about means more than just confirming some bacteria got released into some grain fields,"" Kyra said carefully.

""A longer  observation period would be ideal,"" Dr. Morn acknowledged, ""and I should like to record the effects of the Weep for future reference.""  Kyra suppressed a shiver at the upward twitch of Dr. Morn's lips and the warmth of her voice at the pet name for her latest creation, and listened to Dr. Morn, ""however I shall leave the judgement about the when and how of our escape to you.  Data would be useful, but is not strictly necessary.""

""When do you want to begin our insertion pass?"" Kyra asked as L4m14 helpfully pulled up a holographic display of the target planet with updated details from their sampling visit.

""Begin immediately,"" Dr. Morn said with a flash of canines, ""I shall be finished by the time we exit hyperspace.""

# Deep within the habitation areas of the forge world Nisibis

It was the end of days.  The Priest-Masters and Priestesses had failed to appease Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, with sacrifice, and thus he had stretched out his hand to draw blood.  Blood that Laborer 10 72 8435 knew was his due, for who could argue when a god stretched out his hand?  Even so, he abased himself before a shrine to the Empress, and begged her to intercede for his unworthy planet such that they may be instructed why they were being punished.  It was a thin hope, but all the hope he had.

The Priest-Masters believed that sacrifice in sufficient quantity would quell the god's rage, and so all over the planet Laborer 10 72 8435 knew that the sacrificial altars were slick with the blood of laborers like him, and even the Initiate-Highborn were not safe from the knife.  Meaning, they were even more likely to be selected than usual, for none stood above the duty of sacrifice.  However, it mattered not how much or from whence the blood flowed, the punishment was unceasing.

All and sundries were afflicted, weakness of body, inability to eat without vomiting, and tears of blood flowing without restraint no matter how lofty a personage was afflicted.  Truly, they must have done something of great offense to Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, to merit such a punishment.  Indeed, though Laborer 10 72 8435 was uncommonly hale for a serf, he was already feeling weakness drag at his limbs and food did not sit well in his belly.  He knew that his blood would be spilled to sate Axzuur eventually, either upon the altar or from this punishment, but he harbored a secret hope that Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, might be sated before he succumbed.

Before Nisbis had given offense to Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, Laborer 10 72 8435 had harbored loftier goals.  To provide such worth that he be allowed and required to mate and sire offspring, and the private hope that such an offspring might be a warrior or even a priestess.  However, he dared not even cast his mind back to such dreams, for it might have been such grasping above their station that had offended Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, in the first place.  Indeed, he tried to forget how his habitation district used to smell without the sour tang of vomit in every stairwell, the metallic scent of blood in the very air, and even the rank odor of the dead left where they fell, for the crematoriums were overburdened with the Initiate-Highborn alone.

Thus, Laborer 10 72 8435 endeavored to provide worth despite the punishment.  He did, even still, allow himself to weep durring his abasement, for the Empress was not offended by grief and tears.   When Laborer 10 72 8435 passed before a reflective surface and saw the blood dripping down his face, he realized that he had not merely been weeping as he abased himself.

1hlg0sd,https://v.redd.it/0gqeyhahgt8e1,Advice on practice espresso pull (16 grams),"I started practicing on some old beans I have sitting around, so I'm not expecting good delicious espresso. This is my first (or second?) pull of coffee I've ground up myself using a cheap Krups flat burr grinder at its finest setting. I'm waiting to receive a DF54, so this grinder is all I can use for now.

I'm pulling this shot in an IMS basket which I know is probably not a good idea with a cheap grinder, but based on this video pull, do I need to grind finer?

As you can tell from the video, I'm using the scales auto timer feature, so the preinfusion time is not being captured on the timer.

If I remember correctly, these are light-medium roast beans (don't have the packaging anymore), and the shot tasted very sour, but again I'm not expecting good espresso since these are old beans. Mainly using them to practice technique (dosage, timing, yield), although to be honest, I don't know what else I can do until I receive the DF54 since I can't go finer with my current grinder.

A couple hints if you get one of these great machines: \* watch the YouTube videos on setup - the lengthy printed manual is confusing. \* do the water hardness test. I forgot at first, but you need to set it to know how often to do the scaling \* do the 4-5 test runs before your first coffee drink. \* You'll need to empty the spill tray soon after because oft he test runs.

We were coworkers, went to couple of trips(some of them was business trips) and she seem fun. Things got evolved and we are here. I moved to her city, which my family also live(I live with them mostly.) because she has a dog and want to have time with it. She loves me. I‚Äôm sure about that. But she is so unadventurous. She rarely gets excited on the plans on outside, she never have to urge to socialize etc and it started to push me away. We never argued or got into a fight for 2 years. We have a good communication, but:

* I love to travel, she say so. But we never done it. I offered have 3 times, one time I also purchased the concert tickets for a festival. Declined because of finances but bought herself a watch and furniture instead, costed 2x.
* I love bars and I had a band to play. She is sluggish, don‚Äôt like to drink that much and feels disturbed in the places with loud music. We‚Äôve gone to a EDM festival and she got headache and heart palpations.
* She has no friends in this city, even she grow up here. I introduced her to my friends but she seems distant and does not adapt. She does not smoke, drink or do anything etc. People want to have fun but she is nervous around people which she does not know well.
* She never does anything spontaneous. Try to plan everything even it is a small coffee date.
* She is playing games until late time. Wakes up 1PM. We don't have same topics to talk, because nothing happens.
* I also have ADHD and want to be stimulated. I want to discuss mentally stimulating things and I want to travel. I want to have fun in festivals.

I make a shit ton of money, relative to my country. I can do whatever I want, also help her to to join me. But her lack of passion is driving me insane and takes off the joy.  
  
Should I break up? I talked her that I started to become unhappy, because I lost my circle, passions, hobbies etc. She said she will change but I dont believe it is possible.

With that said, I noticed repeat patterns where these types of ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù first dates suggested by women more times than not, NEVER led to a second date, specifically:

1. Coffee dates in the morning 
2. No phone number exchange prior to first date
3. FaceTime or video dates

I know ‚ÄúDry January‚Äù is around the corner and will be all the craze on everyone‚Äôs profiles, so I thought I‚Äôd get a head start thinking about this.

Coffee dates at night are even worse. The last thing I need after 3 cups of coffee during the day is a FOURTH cup after 6pm, no way will I be able to sleep. I‚Äôve also found that lots of coffee shops are noisy, with lots of younger kids (high school etc) hanging out. 

As for the video dates, it feels forced, almost like a Zoom call and being at work. Is this an interview or a date? The issue with FaceTime and video dates is you can‚Äôt gauge in person body language or chemistry, and is often akward.

Now I know there are exceptions, but I am basing this off a large sample size. Combinations of more than one of the above (example: coffee date and no phone number exchange) was even worse.

Dates that involved meeting at a bar almost always had a MUCH better probability of leading to at least a second, etc date.

Anyone else experience similar?  My goal going forward in 2025 would be to avoid those types of low effort first dates I mentioned above.",2,1735054494.0,SwipeHelper,0,1.0,False

Your feedback and comments were so so helpful - I feel confident in including Y as part of my blend now, and it was really nice to hear that I am on the right track with my other essences. Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder which are really most dominant.

It seems that silhouettes, color strategies and fabric make a big difference in determining our main essences. But in my case, I can do R, Y or HS silhouettes, but when I lean HS I can‚Äôt have too much structure/sharpness, when I lean Y I can‚Äôt have the colors be too light or soft, and when I lean R I can‚Äôt have too much fullness. All of them work but none of them work perfectly. Could this indicate they‚Äôre all somewhat equal, with none super dominant? Maybe like 30/25/25?

Also, I‚Äôd love for someone to make a post about Natural, what it really is and what counts towards it. I‚Äôm surprised all the time by comments about N. Apparently all instances of sleeveless tops and dresses have N. But then I got a comment yesterday (sorry I‚Äôm forgetting your username!) who showed a jumpsuit I would‚Äôve labeled *very* N, and John said it is actually mostly R.

¬†The soft, melodic tune began to fill the garden, transforming the air into a symphony of enchantment. Lily‚Äôs fingers tightened around the bouquet of purple roses. She stood at the edge of the aisle, gazing down at the path that led to the altar, her heart racing with a mix of apprehension and excitement. The day had been nothing short of a dream‚Äîa warm, sun-dappled garden adorned with fragrant flowers, laughter, and the warmth of love in the air.

The gentle breeze seemed to kiss her skin as she took a deep breath, grounding herself in the moment. She had spent months dreaming of this day, picturing every detail from the garden‚Äôs natural elegance to the way Joshua would look at her when she walked down the aisle. It was a day she had longed for and envisioned countless times, and now that it had arrived, the reality of the moment filled her with a profound sense of joy and reverence.

Lily‚Äôs fingers loosened around the bouquet of roses as she recalled their first meeting. It had been in a bustling coffee shop on a rainy afternoon. Joshua‚Äôs laughter had drawn her attention to the table across the room. She remembered how he had looked up, his eyes locking with hers, and a shy smile forming on his lips. She had felt an immediate connection, a spark that ignited the flame of their future together.

Their relationship had swiftly blossomed into something beautiful and intense. They spent countless hours getting to know each other, sharing their deepest fears and desires. Joshua had quickly become her confidante, her rock. They embarked on countless adventures, exploring the city and savoring the simple moments that life had to offer.

In those early days, Lily had felt as though she were living in a dream. She and Joshua were inseparable, sharing everything from their laughter to their tears. It had been a whirlwind romance, with late-night conversations, candlelit dinners, and stolen kisses in the moonlight. She remembered the way his touch had ignited a fire within her, and how his laughter had filled her with joy.

But amidst the whirlwind of emotions and shared dreams, there had also been challenges. They had faced moments of doubt and fear, questioning whether they were truly meant to be together. Yet, through it all, they had found strength in each other, holding onto the belief that their love would conquer any obstacle.

Now, as she stood at the edge of the aisle, ready to begin the next chapter of their lives, Lily felt a mixture of excitement and nerves. She took a deep breath, her chest tightening with emotion. She glanced over at Joshua, who met her gaze with a reassuring smile. His presence brought her a sense of calm, reminding her of the unbreakable bond they shared.

‚ÄúThe music is playing, you have to start walking,‚Äù the wedding coordinator‚Äôs voice broke through her reverie. Lily looked at her and nodded, feeling a surge of determination. She adjusted her cream silk gloves and remembered how welcoming and lovely his parents had been when she met them for the first time.

It was a day etched in her memory‚Äîa warm, sunny afternoon in their backyard, filled with laughter and delicious food. Joshua's parents had embraced her as part of their family from the moment they met her, and Lily had felt an overwhelming sense of belonging.

¬†‚ÄúLily, come meet my parents,‚Äù Joshua had said, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

She had been nervous, clutching the bouquet of flowers she had brought as a gift. But the moment she saw Joshua's parents, her anxiety melted away.

""Welcome, Lily!"" Joshua's mother, Emma, had said, pulling her into a warm hug. ""Joshua has told us so much about you. We‚Äôre thrilled to finally meet you!""

Joshua's father, a jovial man with a hearty laugh, had clapped her on the back. ""So you're the one who stole my son's heart! Good job, Lily, good job!""

¬†Lily had laughed, feeling a blush rise to her cheeks. ""Thank you for having me. This place is beautiful.""

¬†They had spent the afternoon talking and laughing. Emma had prepared a feast, and Lily had marveled at the spread.

¬†""This is amazing, Emma,"" Lily had said, taking a bite of a delicious pie. ""You‚Äôre an incredible cook.""

¬†Emma had smiled warmly. ""I‚Äôm glad you like it, Lily. It‚Äôs a family recipe.""

Joshua's father had regaled them with stories, each one funnier than the last. ""And then,"" he had said, his eyes twinkling with mirth, ""Joshua fell right into the pool! Fully clothed! Funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen!""

¬†""Thanks for bringing that up, Dad,"" Joshua had said, rolling his eyes but smiling.

¬†Lily's heart swelled with love as she thought about the genuine affection she held for Joshua's parents. They had always been accommodating, kind, and gracious, and she had been excited about the prospect of officially becoming a part of their family.

¬†""You should start walking, Lily,"" the coordinator whispered again, her voice barely audible over the music. Lily hesitated for a moment, torn between her desire to walk to the lyrics of a special song and the reality of the moment.

""But I'm not hearing any lyrics,"" she thought desperately, her gaze fixed on the charming path ahead. ""I want to start walking when I hear lyrics.""

And then it happened‚Äîthe lyrics began. An overwhelming rush of emotions washed over her, a complex blend of fear, uneasiness, and a subtle undercurrent of dread. Her heart pounded louder, threatening to drown out the music.

""You have to start walking,"" the coordinator urged once more, her voice insistent. With a deep breath, Lily took her first step down the aisle, her cream-colored dress trailing behind her like a flowing river of silk. The wedding attendants, who had been waiting with bated breath, rose from their seats, their cameras and smartphones held aloft to capture the moment.

Tears welled up in Lily's eyes as she continued her slow, deliberate walk toward the altar. She blinked them away, unwilling to let them mar the perfection of the day. As she approached the altar, her gaze locked onto Joshua, her future husband. He stood there, the epitome of handsome in his well-fitted suit.

Her eyes took in every detail‚Äîthe cream shirt, the perfectly tailored vest, and the tie she had personally selected. It all made him look distinguished; a man ready to take on the world. Despite the fear and unease that had gripped her just moments before, she couldn't help but think, ""He looks very handsome.""

¬†Joshua's eyes were fixed on her as she approached, a warm and genuine smile gracing his face. The worries that had plagued Lily earlier seemed to melt away in that moment. His love and anticipation were palpable, and it reassured her that this was the right decision.

¬†As Lily drew nearer, she could see the twinkle in his eyes, a silent promise of a future together. Her heartache and doubt seemed to fade as she locked eyes with him, and a sense of serenity washed over her. The world around them blurred, and it felt as though it was just the two of them, united by their love.

The guests stood in awe, their cameras capturing the magic of this moment. Tears continued to trickle down Lily's cheeks, but now they were tears of joy and relief. She had been nervous, unsure if she was making the right choice, but seeing Joshua waiting for her at the altar, all doubts melted away.

Step by step, she moved closer to him, their connection growing stronger with each passing moment. The fragrance of the roses in her bouquet filled the air, adding to the enchantment of the day. Lily's gloved hand brushed against her cheek, wiping away her tears, as she finally stood before Joshua.

He reached out, taking her hand in his, and Lily felt an electric spark pass between them. It was as though the universe was telling her that this was where she belonged, that their love was real and destined to endure.

The ceremony proceeded; their vows exchanged with heartfelt sincerity. Lily and Joshua promised to stand by each other's side, to weather any storm, and to cherish every joy. As they sealed their union with a tender kiss, the applause and cheers of their family and friends filled the air, echoing the celebration of their love.

The kiss marked the official start of their journey together as husband and wife. As Lily and Joshua pulled away from each other, their smiles radiated the kind of happiness that could light up the darkest of nights. They turned to face their guests, hand in hand, as the cheers and applause grew louder, filling the garden with an infectious joy.

Lily and Joshua's wedding celebration continued at a lavish and enchanting reception venue called The Enchanted Kettle. The sun had dipped below the horizon, casting a soft, romantic glow over the surroundings as guests made their way to the reception hall.

The reception was held in a grand ballroom adorned with opulent decorations. Crystal chandeliers hung from the high ceiling, their shimmering light dancing across the room. Tables were elegantly set with pristine white linens, sparkling glassware, and delicate floral centerpieces that complemented the color scheme of cream and lavender.

Soft, melodic music played in the background as guests found their seats. The room was filled with laughter, the clinking of glasses, and the joyous chatter of loved ones who had come together to celebrate Lily and Joshua's union.

At the head table, the newlyweds sat, a radiant couple with smiles that never seemed to fade. They gazed at each other with an unspoken understanding, reveling in the momentous occasion that had brought them together.

The reception kicked off with heartfelt toasts from the best man and maid of honor, both sharing touching stories of the couple's love and journey. The claps and cheers that followed echoed through the hall.

The best man, Tom, raised his glass first. ""I've known Joshua since we were kids,"" he began, smiling warmly at the couple. ""We've been through a lot together, but I have to say, I've never seen him as happy as he is with Lily. She's brought out the best in him, and I couldn't be more thrilled to see them start this new chapter together. To Joshua and Lily!""

""To Joshua and Lily!"" the guests echoed, raising their glasses in unison.

Next, the maid of honor, Cindy, took the microphone. ""Lily and I have been best friends since college,"" she said, her voice trembling slightly with emotion.

""I've watched her grow into the incredible woman she is today, and seeing her with Joshua, I know she's found her perfect match. They've taught me what true love looks like, and I couldn't be happier for them. Cheers to a lifetime of love and happiness!""

The crowd erupted into applause, and Lily's eyes glistened with tears. She leaned over to Joshua, whispering, ""I can't believe this is happening. It's all so perfect.""

Joshua squeezed her hand. ""It really is,"" he replied, his voice filled with admiration. ""I'm the luckiest man in the world.""

Then, the delicious aroma of a gourmet dinner wafted through the air as guests were treated to a delectable feast. The culinary delights ranged from succulent roasted meats to elegant vegetarian dishes, satisfying the diverse tastes of the guests.

As dinner concluded, the dance floor beckoned. The couple's first dance was a mesmerizing moment‚Äîa choreographed waltz that left everyone in awe of their love and unity. Guests joined in, and the dance floor quickly filled with family and friends, twirling and swaying to the music.

The evening was punctuated by memorable moments‚Äîa lively bouquet toss, a heartwarming father-daughter dance, and a jubilant cake-cutting ceremony. The wedding cake, a masterpiece adorned with lavender-hued flowers, was as delicious as it was stunning.

As the night deepened, the party continued, with the DJ spinning tunes that kept the dance floor alive and guests celebrating well into the late hours. The room was filled with laughter, love, and a sense of shared happiness.

The reception was a testament to the love and commitment of Lily and Joshua, a celebration of their journey and the start of their new life together. It was a night of joy, laughter, and cherished memories that would be etched in their hearts forever. It was a celebration of love in its purest form, and Lily couldn't help but feel grateful for this perfect day.

As the evening wore on, Lily's emotions shifted from excitement to a profound sense of contentment. She gazed at her husband, who seemed to look even more handsome. The cream shirt, vest, and tie had been the perfect choice. He truly did look distinguished, and Lily couldn't have been prouder to call him her husband.

They danced together one last time before bidding farewell to their guests. Lily clung to the memory of that dance, knowing that their love was real and powerful enough to overcome any obstacle that might come their way.

Little did Lily know that this beautiful day would mark the beginning of a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns, secrets hidden beneath the surface, and challenges they never could have imagined. But for now, in this perfect moment, all she could feel was the overwhelming happiness of marrying the man she loved.¬†continue reading on [https://reamstories.com/page/m4y950x9g8](https://reamstories.com/page/m4y950x9g8)",1,1735054078.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Ingredients
‚ñ¢2 egg whites
‚ñ¢1 dash lemon juice
‚ñ¢2 1/4 cups almond flour (it ended up being about 200g - I used some ground almonds, I think it's the same - came out fine!) 
‚ñ¢1 3/4 cups powdered sugar (about 200g)
‚ñ¢1 pinch salt
‚ñ¢1/4 tsp baking powder
‚ñ¢1 tsp orange zest about half a large orange
‚ñ¢1 tbsp almond extract
‚ñ¢1 tsp vanilla extract
‚ñ¢1/2 cup powdered sugar for coating cookies
Instructions
Whip egg whites and lemon juice together with a stand mixer or hand mixer until stiff peaks form.
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift in almond flour ( I did one batch sifted, one batch where I didn't sift the ground almonds, didn't see a difference. Do sift the powdered sugar though!) , 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, salt, and baking powder and fold into egg whites. I don‚Äôt do it all at once but maybe in 2-3 batches. Try to keep some air in the egg whites, but at this point it will form a pretty sticky dough rather than a fluffy meringue.
Add orange zest, vanilla extract, and almond extract and fold in until combined.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using clean hands, roll dough into balls about 1‚Ä≥ in diameter, then roll in powdered sugar until well coated. Shape into an oval, then arrange on baking sheet with some space between them for spreading, and flatten slightly.
Leave at room temperature for about an hour or until the tops have dried out and formed almost a little shell. (This may take longer in humid areas.) Pre-crack the shell by squeezing the cookies slightly from opposite corners. (Not doing this won‚Äôt affect the taste, but pre-cracking them makes them much prettier if you want that beautiful white-gold contrast!)
While cookies are drying, preheat oven to 300 degrees. When the cookies are ready, bake for about 20 minutes. Cool and store in an airtight container. These are even better the next day and are great with coffee or tea!",5,1735054036.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

**TLDR: Folio - Amazing, Pen - Great, Manta - Amazing, software - Great, customer service - S tier.**  


So... its has been few glorious days with the Manta since I have purchased it, and I have decided to drop some thoughts for people who are still on the fence or in general.

I have been using the scribe for work and books for close to a year now. I liked it. I am a developer, and my needs grew exponentially in the past half a year since i switched my employer.

I have been eyeing the Supernote brand for some time now, I have been other brands too (insert the popular and not so popular brands), but supernote grabbed me with great customer support on reddit, with great ideas for sustainability, and being overall customer eccentric for functionality and in general.

  
So, I ordered the Manta last week, received it end of last week, and I have been transferring slowly my work related notes (I have over 100 pages work related alone, and about \~20 personal that I have to transfer) and being over 40 pages deep, and after reading a little bit from one of my books, one coffee spill over the whole darn thing... and I have some thoughts I can share!

First of all ... the folio. I received my supernote without the folio, and few days later I have received the half folio. and my o my how different it feels with the folio! Very VERY well made. Very good quality, high quality, it fits perfectly, it is secure, and it is a good scratch protection if you trow it in the bag or something. I highly recommend it, amazing product!

The pen. I have ordered the ""simple"" push up pen, that many do not like very much it seems on a glance on reddit at least, but I dont like pen caps so I decided I want a push up pen. First impressions after about 40+ pages written for work, are VERY solid. The pen feels good, feels sturdy, feels solid. It is light, but good-light, not too light just light enough, the mechanism is good, it has a good design (subjective I know but isn't anything and everything subjective?), clean design. Fits perfectly in the loop (duh). The writing experience from the pen itself is good, if you write a lot it is hard, on the fingers, especially if you have a heavy writing hand, but that goes for every pen that is metal or plastic and is hard. For long writing sessions might be a good idea to find a soft ""grip"" of sorts for the finger tips but, I do not plan to have long writing sessions after I finish my transfer so I am good for now. I fully recommend the pen, great product, I am not sure why people dont like it, but its a great product, well worth the money in my opinion.

Now ... the crown jewel of the show! The Manta! First of all build quality so far. the product is very light especially compared to my last e-ink scribe, and that is VERY GOOD! I have a broken wrist with long term damage, and this really helps for me. The device has a clean design, It looks good, it feels good, I had some concerns with the screen, but after writing on it for some time I can confirm the screen is going nowhere unless you drop it or poke it. I had also some concerns with the power button, as it feels ... plasticy (sorry I have no better word), but after I got the folio, and saw that it turns on and off with the folio opened and closed those concerns have somewhat been alleviated since I plan to use it with the folio a lot, and rarely without or rarely to use the button in general. In general the device is amazing, I like it a lot, it has great feel in the hand, and I wanted to say bravo to the team that engineered it! Great work! Not going to lie though few buttons would have been great, buttons for page change in notes and in books would have been THE BOMB for me!

  
The Software. Now this was the main reason i switched over. So far I am learning, so my negatives might turn in to positives with time.

Positives - fun gestures, usable, not a gimmick for sure, love the hyperlinks, love the option to change my wallpaper. There are plenty I am trying to get use to or to learn so this is why there are not so much here. I need more time :)

Neutrals and negatives - the kindle app is usable ,its alright, but its a bit finicky, and that might be optimized for this device. When switching from one screen to another (changing pages) the page moves a little bit and sometimes you dont switch the page. This might be something in the settings but ... idk yet. Also I cant seem to find my wish list for the life of me. And I have searched far and wide! Also the ""no home screen"" option baffles me a little bit at first, I am trying to be open minded, but not being able to have something like a home screen where I can decide what to put there ... is not very convenient for me personally ... for now, will see. The hyperlink borders are a little bit too big. I would love to somehow being able to link to another word and when switching the page that word to be highlighted in some sort of way (idk how). I am not sure if I am a fan of the manual refresh yet. The star feature ... I am not very much sold on it yet also.

Last but not least the customer experience. I am extremely impressed with the customer support I have seen on reddit, and that I have personally received. In a previous post I have explained that already, but in short, this is the best customer support and experience I have seen in a long while. This this amazes me having in mind that I work in this field for a big tech company.  

  
PS: the other day before I got my folio (and good thing I did not have my folio yet lol), i spilled a third of a costa coffee cup on the Manta, the pen and my phone. Sooooooo naturally my heart dropped ... for the manta not my phone even though the phone is 3x the price lol (strange ...), and after a fast wipe, of all devices, the only damage is that the pen loop has coffee stain on it and it reeks of coffee a little bit. I used the device for 2 days after that heavily and there are zero issues. Of course don't try this at home kids, but ... its a good to know that the device will survive some coffee spills and water spills hopefully.

    The meet up went very well‚Äî it was lighthearted and we got to catch up on each others‚Äô lives.

https://thekitchenbarista.com/products/t64-single-dose-coffee-grinder-with-flat-burrs-black?variant=50234048610604

Anyway, the variable speed version is only $599 Canadian with a further 15% discount code still to be added.

T64 - $549 ($467 with discount)
T64S (variable) - $599 ($510 with discount)

DF64 gen 2 with DLC burrs - $550
DF64V  v2 with DLC burrs - $760

Just wondered if anyone has used them?  There's a few videos on YouTube from within last year.  But surprised at this price point they aren't seen in any larger channels or comparison videos with the really popular DF range.   There doesn't seem to be an ionizer but otherwise there seems to be some good design choices. And I think it looks a little nicer than the DF range too.

Biggest concern would be issues and replacement parts etc.   I've had enough problems with my DF54 and they have relatively good support.

1hlflcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1hlflcx/haven_on_viva_review_summary_of_thoughts/,Haven on Viva- review/ summary of thoughts.,"I‚Äôve recently completed our first cruise ever on NCL Viva. We booked a 2 bedroom room suite as we had 2 kids and a family member. Had I relied solely on the reviews and YouTube videos, I‚Äôd have probably never booked it (general sentiment that it‚Äôs not worth it). Here are my quick thoughts on a first cruise from a perspective of experienced travelers with 30+ countries visited to date:
- The ship design is a bit quirky and takes a while to figure it out but also creates a nice distribution of people hence spaces are generally not crowded (unless you are at the main pool)
- Staff in haven is 10 stars (out of 5 possible üòÆ)- the steward, butler, haven restaurant waiters, BARTENDERS and everyone else went above and beyond
- Private elevators are priceless
- Haven pool/ jacuzzi deck is never packed
- Food is phenomenal, even though the menu in haven is static; is quite large to get something new each day. Substitution and custom stuff is allowed!
- Drinks in Haven bars are 10x quality of a regular bar. Those were some of the best cocktails we‚Äôve ever had (beating some of the best cocktail bars in the world that we have visited). The amount of custom made bitters, mixers, dehydrated fruits and garnishes is amazing.
- Having a butler is great, especially for coffee makers replenishments, breakfast set up on the balcony and ad hoc request for kids.
- Speciality restaurants are really good. Le Bistro is a must, palomar and onda are great. Cagneys is solid but steak is the same as Haven.
- Premium plus drink package was awesome. Albeit the extended wine selection (from an amateur certified somm perspective) was solid but not great. We have used it extensively for premium liquor, Starbucks and aqua panna.


General ship:
- Gokarts are super fun
- mini golf is nice.
- galaxy arcade has awesome sim VR racing but everything else was lame or not working (gyro).
- public pool looks packed and ghetto (screaming, fighting for chairs, playing music from cellphones) at times.
- excursions via NCL were great and well organized.



In summary:

- If you can afford it, haven is 101% worth it, I will never cruise without it.
- general complimentary restaurants are packed but the food haul was decent. General service elsewhere is nice but inefficient with mediocre food.
- there need to be more live music shows- the rumors were canceled due to lines, the Saturday prom show was also cancelled‚Ä¶ however the latin music duo, syd‚Äôs band and beetlejuice were all excellent/
- While haven is worth it, I was generally annoyed by nickel and dime efforts (daily upsell, charging for water in room- WTF etc..). They need to rethink the concept so it doesn‚Äôt take away from the luxury feel (haven passengers shouldn‚Äôt have to buy premium alcohol packages etc..).
- we will book another cruise but it has to be in the destination otherwise difficult to access via non-cruise travel (Alaska, fjords etc..)
 - WiFi was good but expensive. ",2,1735053457.0,NCL,1,0.75,False

I recently got a Lalit Mara X paired with the Eureka Mignon Specialita grinder, and while I love the setup, I‚Äôm having a frustrating issue: no matter what I try, I can‚Äôt get my shots to extract without a sour taste (under extract). My flow is consistently too fast, and by the time 30 seconds have passed, I'm well over 50 ml of water.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

‚Ä¢ Set the grinder to its finest position (practically choking the machine).

‚Ä¢ Increased my dose to 19‚Äì20 grams in a 14-18-gram basket.

‚Ä¢ Always used freshly roasted medium-light coffee (roasted within the last three weeks).

Despite these adjustments, I still can‚Äôt hit a proper extraction time with the right flow. The puck prep is as consistent as I can make it (tamping evenly), but I‚Äôm starting to feel like I might be missing something obvious or crucial.

Has anyone experienced this issue with the Mara X or the Specialit√† grinder? Could it be related to my puck prep, machine pressure, or something else entirely?

Any advice, tips, or troubleshooting suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for helping out a struggling home barista!",1,1735053351.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

The beautiful woman's voice poured honey in my ears. Honey, and insults. Deeply hurtful insults. ‚ÄúYou seem like a big loser. I think God might buy you trying to kill yourself. He's a sucker for suicides on Christmas Eve.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

The attractive woman - out of the league for every barfly present, including the retired and disgraced lawyers - sat at my corner table and these were her immediate and rapid words. 

She seemed pretty excited. ‚ÄúHow'd you like to make 500 bucks tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you would.‚Äù Her manicured fingernails, dark red, slipped deftly into her slightly exposed brazier and produced the elastic stack of mentioned cash. She dropped it like a microphone after a victorious rap battle, right on the table. The paint-chipped table. 

The surface was carved with the initials of three generations of Lail men, including me, the worst and least accomplished of a long line of bums, draft dodgers and deadbeats, cowards and inadequate fathers.

At least I wasn't that. I had no children. I had no wife. I had no family left on speaking terms but my mom. My only legacy would be this table at Sports Bar, a hole so dank it didn't bother with an original name. It didn't even play modern sports. There was one ancient TV and the old bartender - I never knew his name but he knew mine - popped in VHS tapes of hockey from the 80s and 90s on repeat. Except on Christmas Eve. 

Jimmy Stewart mocked us with his desperation. He - George Bailey, the character Stewart played - had a wife, kids, a job. Yet, he still thought about killing himself on Christmas Eve. Nobody here, none of us unfortunates, had anything on George Bailey. 

Especially not the courage to walk out into the snowy street and lie down in the path of the next snowplow. 

‚ÄúBorn at the wrong time,‚Äù said Beth, the aged prostitute, still game if you are, watching It's A Wonderful Life with intensity, like she hadn't been here since the morning and seen it half a dozen times. Twenty bucks for Beth, for you name it. I think she married the bartender years back. Neither seemed to remember.

‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Beth,‚Äù the bartender said.

She glared at him and muttered curses into her mostly empty pint.

The only reason I noticed their exchange at all came down to lighting. What's darker than dank but not total pitch? It's whatever shadows followed this lady around like an evil pool of fog. We sat in it. I breathed it in. I longed to be at the bar and in the muted glow of red and green string lights from a more innocent, less energy efficient era.

But the money. She'd picked the right guy. She knew her losers well.

I touched the wad to see her reaction, of which there was none. 

‚Äú500 bucks,‚Äù I said. She let me take it into the inside of my suit jacket, the one I always wore with my track pants. Both belonged to my father, and his father before him. The suit jacket belonged to another time, and so it endured. The track pants were never used for anything athletic, so they endured.

‚ÄúYou have to kill someone,‚Äù she said, and her perfect smile rekindled lust in a body too lazy to act on the most basic tasks. Sex, even the briefest and bad kind, had become a fantasy that brought on depression. I'd never found anybody. I never would. No one was coming. Nobody rescued Jimmy Lail.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I drained the last half of my pint, and the old bartender came with another before my empty glass hit the table. My father drank his days away. My grandfather drowned his nightmares from a war he never attended. Here. This place. This exact table. Why the hell did I choose to sit here every goddamn time,m

‚ÄúHere ya are, Jimmy,‚Äù the old guy said.

I nodded thanks but kept my eyes on her.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou're a real creep. And a pervert.‚Äù

I burped as my roving eye took in the shape of the impossible woman. No women came to Sports Bar. Except Beth. But she was a prostitute. And possibly married. So maybe she didn't count.

‚ÄúYou came to me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd in that dress. Why wear a low cut with such immaculate breasts if not to invite stares?‚Äù And I kept looking.

‚ÄúOne can view a great work of art without jerking off.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI wasn't‚Ä¶ that's‚Ä¶ Listen, what do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're going to the nearest bridge over water,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd you're going to jump.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon't that make it hard to spend my 500 dollars?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy 500 dollars. You only get it if you jump.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think one of us is missing something here,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúGive the money to someone you love, pay off what's likely a tremendous bar tab. Do something good with it to make up for a wasted life of selfish indulgences.‚Äù The way she tilted her head and smiled made it reasonable. 

Her smile skipped the usual transitions to a cold, and flat lipped stare. ‚ÄúOr keep this up for another year or so, whatever time you have left. What are you? Fifty?‚Äù

‚ÄúThirty-three,‚Äù I said, remembering why I didn't sit at the bar: the mirror behind the liquor scared me. I didn't want to see the sad man there. I didn't want to know how bad I'd gotten.

‚ÄúYou have until midnight,‚Äù she said, and the darkness relented because somehow she disappeared in it. 

The money and a heavy perfume, almost covering an odour like rotten garbage, were all that remained to prove the interaction had occurred. I didn't attribute the smell to her. It had to be me or any number of other pieces of humanity in the bar.

The truth of the trash didn't come until later at the bridge.

Auld Lang Syne - the song everyone slurs through at midnight on New Years Eve -  blared from the big screen. The bartender turned up the volume. 

George Bailey, black and white and astonished by the amount of people in a room who love him, picks up his daughter, ZuZu.

A bell on the tinseled Christmas tree nearby rings for no reason.

‚ÄúLook daddy,‚Äù Zuzu says,  ‚Äúteacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù her dad confirms, ‚Äúthat's right.‚Äù

The movie ended, and we drunks were captured by the silence, drinking a little faster to save our feelings for the hangover. 

Beth started balling. The bartender, maybe her husband, comforted her the only way he knew: a shot of something dark, potent. Her weeping quieted, her sadness marked only by the slight trembling of her shoulders as she buried her face into the folds of her wrinkled forearms.

I stood up. The legs of the worn chair scraped against the painted hardwood. No one looked up.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit's Christmas soon. We ought to be celebrating.‚Äù I felt the wad of money but hesitated to pull it out of my coat. Not that the half-dozen other regulars, the strangers I drank with, noticed me. ‚ÄúI've got‚Ä¶ a hundred bucks‚Ä¶ let's all have a‚Ä¶ shot?‚Äô A half dozen grizzled chins, tired faces finally bent my way.

The bartender clapped once. I mean, I paid for my beers, with the unemployment cheques I scammed and the under the table money I earned through odd jobs here and there. But some of these guys looked homeless. How did they pay?

No matter. We shuffled to the bar. Shots of crown royal were poured and we drank them immediately, in unison, without a toast. I handed over a hundred bucks, and turned to leave. One hundred gone from five. Had I really agreed to that woman's demands? Three miles. The nearest bridge over water, a waterfall in fact. Jagged rocks and flat slabs of limestone below. A narrow but deep pool in the middle of all that instant death. 

A surprisingly strong grip seized my forearm. 

The sandpaper hand belonged to a mop of greasy grey hair with a pink skinned man underneath. ‚ÄúI knew your dad,‚Äù his moustache seemed to say. ‚ÄúAnd he was good too. All of the Lails are good.‚Äù

I felt disgusted. How could he say that? My dad spent his time drinking in Sports Bar while his wife and son watched TV late into the night, hoping, just this once, he'd come home. He never did. He got drunk, and he stayed away. The school bully told me once he'd seen my dad sleeping in a doorway. He, the bully, didn't mock me or beat me up; he patted my shoulder and told me to ‚Äúhang in there.‚Äù

I tried to pull away, but the grip persisted.

‚ÄúHe drank. We all do. Why? Ask yourself. Your daddy stayed away. Why?‚Äô‚Äù The grey mane let go. His shaky index finger scolded me. ‚ÄúAsk yourself, Jimmy. Merry Christmas.‚Äù He turned back to the bar and the drink. 

‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù I said, but I don't think he heard me. ‚ÄúMerry Christmas everyone.‚Äù I went for the door. No one replied or said goodbye. No one thanked me for the shots. 

The door to Sports Bar groaned on rusted hinges and clanged shut on a quiet street. I couldn't remember the last white Christmas in Bridal Veil Lake. Global warming had given us green holidays and barbecues into December. Not this year though.

A storm had rolled off the lake a few days back and dropped a heavy blanket. Christmas bulbs within snow, soft green and red and yellow. The picture of my childhood, when I didn't understand the problems that haunted my dad. 

I still don't get it, but I know he passed them along like a tradition, a gift I opened every day and couldn't see clearly, an empty box except for the darkness it contained. 

Light trails of white dust slithered over the plow impacted snow banks. The sidewalks had been made into corridors. I shivered in my suit jacket. I didn't own a winter coat. Too expensive. 

Plus these bouts of weather were brief in the modern age. The temperature would swing wildly above freezing within a day or so. Then the pretty decorations would be set again in mud, litter, cigarette butts.

Each step produced a small but satisfying crunch of powder beneath my sneaker. The south-east part of town had been zoned for factory residential about a hundred years ago. The companies had long gone. They left rusting masses on barren tarmac. The vacuum of their absence tore at once thriving neighbourhoods. Whole blocks were abandoned. 

Kentland Road - my street - had survived because of the buses to Tour Hill. Bridal Veil Lake adapted after the factories shuttered. Arcades and aquariums, wax museums and slots provided precarious employment, enough money to sustain an anorexic existence. 

I tried to focus on the lights, the very picturesque street. These houses were old, red bricks and more than the cookie cutter vaults people called home in the suburbs. Despite it all, I loved this place.

And yet, my eyes lingered on every depressing detail I could find:

A lost dog poster over two years old, the picture faded. The ‚ÄúNeed Food‚Äù cardboard sign in sharpie by the shuttered mall, left in the dirt near the thriving liquor store. A discarded novel by an author I'd never heard of, the pages swollen with moisture and frozen by the temperature dip of the night.

All we do is plead with the universe to acknowledge us, to show us something. But nothing comes. Nothing ever happens.

The plea outlasts the beggar.

Perhaps that's what it is to be human. 

Maybe desperation is our purpose, and some creature gets high off the supply.

These were not my usual ruminations post Sports Bar. At first, I blamed Christmas and the joy so many people were probably basking in while I staggered home.

But then the voice in my head went off script and in a tone objectively alien.

‚ÄúYeah, the world is shit. It's bad. Find a bridge. Find it now. Come on. What do you have to live for Jimmy?‚Äù

I turned around so fast I lost balance and stumbled sideways into the snowbank. Around the corner of the variety store a velvet cape disappeared. Her cheap perfume lingered and so too the stench of scarcely concealed filth.

Whatever pitiful amount of courage I had was spent looking around the edge of the store. A homeless man, wrapped in a new, red blanket slept in a doorway. 

I didn't buy it. Not for a second. It'd been her. Her dwindling stank in the frigid air told the truth.

‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù I said against the wind, an immediate futility sapping the will to remain upright. 

The homeless man startled, and flinched under the warm blanket. His dark eyes glittered. ‚ÄúI'm not your prop,‚Äù he accused, before rolling over again. 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I apologized. When I turned to go, I added,  ‚ÄúI don't want the money.‚Äù

But I'd already taken it. A hundred bucks gone.

A little more quickly, a little more sober than prefered, I walked the rest of the way home. Each blast of wind made me wince. I couldn't hear my own steps or if anyone followed.

By the time I mounted the crooked stairs of my mom's wilted porch, I was trembling and could barely grasp the handle of the outer screen. My mom never locked the doors. I usually made a show of trying the keys first so I could chastise her while she watched TV and paid me no attention.

I resented the pattern.

On this Christmas Eve, however, I'd never been more grateful. Once inside, I shut and locked the screen and threw the bolt on the inside door. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù Mom said from the living room.

My breathing came in short frantic breaths. 

‚ÄúJimmy?‚Äù

It's A Wonderful Life played across the flatscreen set too high above the fireplace. Not again. Mom had built a rare fire for the occasion. I felt drawn to the flames. Frozen skin stung pleasantly in the heat. 

George Bailey defended his deceased father. ‚ÄúYou're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that. But neither you nor anyone else can say anything against his character.‚Äù

Mom put down her drink, and snapped her fingers. ‚ÄúHey, Jimmy, what's happening? You get mugged?‚Äù

I turned around slowly. The fire soothed my refrigerated backside. Mom appeared concerned. Small eyes knitted at the brows. Her lips peeled slightly to reveal smoker's teeth. Fear and anger made up this familiar expression. She always worried about me. Tooth and nail, she'd never failed to step up when she thought I got the short end.

And why? I'd never done a thing to deserve her love, and I'd done a lot that deserved a booting out the door. She never asked for rent. Fed me. Knew about Sports Bar but didn't give me shit about it. 

She cared about me, more than I could ever care for myself.

‚ÄúJimmy,‚Äù she said, rocking forth from her chair in children's pajamas; her small frame made it difficult to find adult clothes. The pants and button-up shirt had trains racing around her legs and arms, and a bright light blasting from a tunnel in her torso. ‚ÄúYou're freaking me out.‚Äù

I smiled. Pretty badass pajamas. ‚ÄúI got a job, ma.‚Äù

Immediate suspicion cinched her eyelids. ‚ÄúA job? Tonight? What kind of job? With who?‚Äù She snatched up her gin. Who could blame her? I'd had plenty of ‚Äújobs‚Äù before. Nothing majorly bad. Stolen goods from Walmart needed to be stored until they could be sold online. I kept Playstations and Xboxes under my bed for a small fee. Got to keep a console too. I sold it.

‚ÄúNot like that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt's‚Ä¶ look, I got an advance already.‚Äù I took out the $400. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

She chugged the gin and poured another from the glass decanter on the coffee table. ‚ÄúWhat's the job, Jimmy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù I lied, poorly.

‚ÄúUh-huh. Why are you telling me about it this time? What's different?‚Äù She snapped her fingers under my nose because I didn't answer fast enough.

‚ÄúIt's different,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbecause I won't get in trouble. It isn't illegal.‚Äù Wait, is it illegal to kill yourself? Couldn't be. Nobody to arrest but a corpse. ‚ÄúAnd this money is for you.‚Äù I held out the crisp bills for her to take.

She shook her head, and slid back into the recliner. Her gaze went through me to the TV and the movie.

‚ÄúTake it,‚Äù I said, kneeling down at her feet, ‚Äúit's for you. For all-‚Äù

Mom shushed me, raised a hand, about to give me a slap, something she had never done. ‚ÄúJimmy,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI love you. From the moment you were born and I held you. I will always love you. You've made some poor choices, and I never blamed you. God knows you weren't dealt the best hand. But this is the first time, the only time, Jimmy, you make me ashamed.‚Äù

I wished she had smacked me. I sat down on the hardwood and looked at the money in my lap. ‚ÄúIt's for you. I didn't steal it. I'm going to earn it. I'm going right now. Honest work, ma. Honest. Please take the money.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She lit a cigarette. 

‚ÄúPlease. I need you to take it. It's the only good thing I'll do.‚Äù Tears came unexpectedly. I hadn't cried over anything since the age of eight when I understood Dad would not be coming home.

Mom cupped my cheek. ‚ÄúJimmy, you don't need to. Give it back.‚Äù

I stood up. She followed. The top of her head reached only below my chin. I dropped the bills on her slippers, and went for the door. 

‚ÄúJimmy, don't go.‚Äù

I ignored her. 

I closed the front door and locked it with my key, already aware that the panic from earlier had come from something unnatural outside. 

Was the beautiful woman lurking beyond the peripheral? I think so. But with friends, many of her monstrous friends. The nearest bridge, Albion Falls, so easily forgotten in the shadow of the town's namesake, could be reached in an hour at walking speed.

I had about fifty minutes until midnight.

The thousands of eyes I couldn't see but feel from even the smallest pockets of darkness were waiting. If I didn't hold up my end of the bargain, if I wasn't over the railing before midnight‚Ä¶ They were here for me.

Running to avoid being murdered so that I could kill myself was ridiculous, and maybe ironic. One would expect to avoid murderous creatures of the night to go on living. Not me. Not a Lail man. 

As I passed from familiar neighbourhoods to the relatively strange borders of the abandoned factories, I tripped over a buried train rail, and ate shit on a storm drain. Huge clots of snow fell from the sky and stuck to my unshaven face. 

I checked the time. Only fifteen minutes, and far to go. Darker shades of black pushed against the light, constrained but barely by the agreement I had made with probably the devil. The hot devil. But the smell. Stank is ugly.

Slipping across a patch of ice, tripping over buried curbs, I fled the growing masses of still unknown evil. 

The roadway bridge over Albion Falls discouraged tourists. There were no sidewalks and only a yellow guardrail up to the knees. A fall would likely be fatal. 

I had played in the gentle creek at the foot of the Albion as a child. It felt like a magical place, where faeries showered and treasures awaited behind the curtain of water; I always checked. Video games train players to look behind waterfalls. The perpetual disappointment of the empty hollow didn't dissuade me from the idea. Nope, I simply believed someone else had gotten there first. That I had lost the race. My childhood ended the second I stopped believing I would be first someday, that I would find the treasure, that there even was a treasure for people like me.

No more.

Exhausted, out of breath, with a fair stream of snot freezing in my moustache, I entered the pool of illumination offered by the one streetlight on the bridge. Fifteen minutes to spare. 

I looked down. Darkness. The world held an abundance of the stuff. In my head, I knew the jagged death below, and the slim hope of the narrow deep somewhere in the middle. As far as I knew, nobody jumped from the bridge ever. Who knew if the rocks could be avoided?

And why would I want that anyway? If I somehow survived, they would be upon me. I dared to look back as the last minutes depleted from this Christmas Eve. 

On the edges of the humble streetlight's offering gathered hundreds with yellow eyes trailing fiery streaks like infernal fireflies whenever they moved. And move they did, practically vibrating with anticipation. 

So many of these evil things together produced a fetid heat that burned the snow into rolling streams of fog. A vapour wall came for me, and I did not want to breathe it in. 

I stepped over the guardrail. Eager creatures or not, I had no reason to stay. Even if Mom didn't keep the $400, my absence would make her rich in savings. The world would be a far better place without Jimmy Lail in it.

Pointlessly, as if I could see anything below, I closed my eyes and began to lean forward. That's when I heard the splash, a watery thunk followed by loud bellowing: ‚ÄúHelp! Heeeellllllpppp!‚Äù

A collective, nasty little snicker came from the group on the road.

I ignored them. ‚ÄúHello? Did‚Ä¶ is there-‚Äù

‚ÄúHaaaaalllllp!‚Äù

I'm not sure what happened next exactly. Never in my life have I done anything heroic or even helpful that I can recall. Yet, I searched for the childhood path down to the bottom of the falls. When found, I didn't hesitate despite a near total inability to see jack shit at all.

‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù

The call for aid grew fainter.

A familiar slab of angled limestone said I only had to jump onto its horizontal twin to reach the bottom. I did but slipped on the icy spray coating the rocks. Straight into the unseen pool, I bumped into the drowning man. 

He calmed immediately and I dragged him onto the flat limestone with surprising ease. I'm not strong. He was light. 

We clung together as we negotiated our way back into the light, shivering uncontrollably. Those creatures were nowhere to be seen, and I half believed they'd never been there in the first place.

The no longer drowning man, now illuminated, turned out to be chubby, red faced, and balding, a Santa Claus if he'd shaved off his beard.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked me. Me.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're not going to do it, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúJump.‚Äù

‚ÄúJump? How did you‚Ä¶ wait, wait a second, you jumped‚Ä¶ from where‚Ä¶‚Äù He'd had to have been above me, higher on the bridge, to have landed in the pool. There is no structure above the roadway. It's like he fell out of the sky. ‚ÄúWhere did you come from?‚Äù

He smiled. ‚ÄúHeaven, Jimmy. I'm your guardian angel.‚Äù

Before I could say another word, a black streak whipped between us. Her perfume, and the subtle rot, clotted my nostrils. I wanted to be sick. The beautiful woman had him by the throat and off the ground. His feet dangled and he couldn't breathe.

‚ÄúWell done, Jimmy,‚Äù she said, and the interior of her eyes filled with blood. ‚ÄúAngel is the rarest delicacy for my kind. This is a true gift.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù  I shook violently.

‚ÄúYou can go now,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI doubt you'll want to see this.‚Äù

The sad eyes of the shaven Santa Claus looked shocked at the betrayal. After all, he'd leapt into the water to stop me from jumping. Just like the film. This couldn't be real. I wasn't George Bailey.

‚ÄúI can't,‚Äù I explained to the old man. Despite his impending death, he smiled as if to say ‚ÄúIt's fine, Jimmy. Go on. Go on back to Sports Bar. Your mom. 400 dollars.‚Äù I began to weep. 

‚ÄúPlease, lady,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúlet him go. I'll jump. I'll do whatever. You can have me instead.‚Äù

She snickered and looked simultaneously revolted. ‚ÄúWe're quite full of low grade human blood, thank you. Probably get drunk off you.‚Äù Fangs escaped her gums. She bared them, a warning, a promise. ‚ÄúGo. Before I let them have you.‚Äù She laughed. 

The monstrous shades appeared and closed a circle around the light. I could see more than their eyes. They were not beautiful like their master, and they did not hide the foul cloud emanating from their skin and salivating maws. Upright dogs and wolves caked in dried gore would be a fair general description, though there were more unique oddities in the group, too many to name, too frightening to write.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúcan't have him.‚Äù My voice broke like a prepubescent boy, which she found quite amusing. She tossed the feeble angel across the road. He slid in the layer of snow and bumped into the guardrail on the opposite side. 

‚ÄúJimmy,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúif you want to die by my hand, I'll oblige.‚Äù Black claws stretched and curved and serrated from her fingertips, right before my eyes. 

The midnight church bell tolled, the waves of sound dismissing the disruptive wind as if the creative breath of God had poured forth angrily from His nostrils.

Every creature sank low, and laid their faces against the snow. Powerful, blinding light pulsed with the tolling. The beautiful woman finally became uncertain, and quite perturbed as a fiery gladius blade exited where her black heart should be.

The angel, no longer feeble, but grown in stature, muscle, and beard (yes, a long flowing beard), unfurled marvelous golden white wings.

‚ÄúEvery time a bell rings, bitch,‚Äù he said to the dying vampire. 

The glamour fell. The perfume vanished. She looked a lot like the others except larger in stature and with leathery wings under her hairy arms. Her body fell to pieces and twitched. Panicked eyes searched everywhere and popped out of decaying sockets, rolling away toward the rails, an escape attempt.

They squashed, rotted grapes, under my sneakers. I slipped but a strong hand caught my forearm and brought me back to level. We were alone on the bridge. The snow smelled fresh again, the world clean. Magic had returned to Christmas Eve.

He smiled. The fiery sword evaporated. His wings diminished and faded from this vale of tears. The heavenly glow, the golden armour turned to sparks in the wind, carried away to the sky where they were indistinguishable from the stars. 

He kept the beard though.

In this more humble form, he took my hand and shook it. ‚ÄúThanks, Jimmy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks? Shouldn't I be‚Ä¶ you saved me.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúI jumped in the water to save you. You jumped in to stop that creature, proving you're not what you think you are.‚Äù

I wasn't used to praise. I tried to turn away but his grip, still soft, couldn't be shaken. ‚ÄúWhat do I think I am?‚Äù

He only raised his bushy, white eyebrows.

‚ÄúA loser.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, but now you see, Jimmy, you proved your worth, not to me, I always knew, but to yourself. You were prepared to die to try and save me.‚Äù

I thought about it. All that had happened would take serious time to process. Maybe therapy. 

‚ÄúWhy did he stay away?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Of all the things to say. I'd just started to feel a little better too. Bringing up Dad, the nerve of some people. Angels.

‚ÄúYour father drank, Jimmy. He drank a lot. He couldn't stop. He couldn't control himself, and he knew it, so why did he not come home most nights? Think about it.‚Äù

I didn't want to. Dad was an asshole. Grandpa was an asshole. And a drunk like his son, and grandson. But Grandpa came home every night. 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, understanding finally. ‚ÄúHe stayed away‚Ä¶ he didn't want to do what‚Ä¶ had been done‚Ä¶ to him.‚Äù My whole face trembled, freeing grief so long buried. I'd hated my dad since childhood. I felt numb when he died. 

‚ÄúBut he was a hero,‚Äù I sobbed into the angel's chest.

‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, slow down. Not a hero. Heroes do heroic stuff. It'd have been heroic to overcome his drinking and be there for you and his wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you said-‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did his best, Jimmy. Everyone does their best, and it isn't heroism. It's humanity.‚Äù He finally let go of my hand, and backed away.

‚ÄúWait, where are you going?‚Äù

He smiled more deeply, the wrinkles framing sparkling blue eyes. He pointed up. I looked where he pointed. When I looked back to earth, my guardian angel was gone. I didn't even know his name.

‚ÄúWhat do I do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you going, Jimmy?‚Äù his voice whispered in my ear with emphasis on ‚Äúyou.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the question you should ask yourself from this moment. Never stop asking, son, until you're there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou'll know you're there, when you're there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù I looked around frantically. I shouted into the cold, night air. ‚ÄúWhat does it mean?!‚Äù He'd called me son. In the movie, Clarence, the angel, is a deceased human who's become an angel, trying to earn his wings through good deeds. 

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

I never got an answer on that. The angel had truly blown this popsicle stand. And I was on my own. I'd like to say I ran through the streets, yelling Merry Christmas at everyone and everything, and that a horde of friends welcomed me into my own home. But I've yet to become George Bailey because he's a hero in his story.

And I remain only human, imperfect, though sober - one day at a time. I apologized to Mom. Gave the 400 bucks to charity. Got a real job at the local grocery store. Work out a lot. Got into martial arts. Took a course on folklore.

Because this mild mannered persona is a cover, of course. For fuck's sake, did you just read this shit? Vampires are real. And angels. Probably a whole lot of other evil too. 

So now, instead of drinking, I hunt what hunts us. 

I set up headquarters where I met my first vampire.

# Understanding the Importance of a Storytelling Coffee Table

A coffee table serves not only as a functional piece of furniture but also as a focal point in your living room. It invites conversation and showcases your style and interests. Whether you are displaying family photos, travel souvenirs, or your favorite books, a well-curated coffee table can tell a compelling story about who you are and what matters to you.

# 1. Selecting the Right Coffee Table

* **Round Coffee Tables**: These create a softer aesthetic and are perfect for smaller spaces, encouraging easy movement around the table.

When selecting a coffee table, consider its dimensions (e.g.,¬†**length**¬†of 48 inches,¬†**width**¬†of 24 inches,¬†**height**¬†of 18 inches) to ensure it fits comfortably within your space.Creating a coffee table that reflects your personality and tells your story is an art form that transforms an ordinary living space into a showcase of memories, interests, and artistic expression.

Clearly, I'm not afraid of commitment, between the beard I've managed to grow, nor the video games I have a tendency of playing. I dabble with the occasional racing/sim/sports game, but predominately spend the majority of my time tackling various RPGs, MMOs, or Strategy games. Occasionally, I can be found dabbling outside of that (like Virtua Fighter... ah... classic). However, a cult follower of FPS Shoots or Hero games... I am not. So, LoL, OW, CoD, R6:Siege, etc are not generally in my wheelhouse. I didn't mind them when I was younger, but my tastes have moved on to other things. Also don't care for WoW (I know, heresy). Currently in the middle of finishing out the Expansion content in Elden Ring (+1 Challenge points) after having finally gotten around to completing Dragon's Dogma 2.

When I'm not adventuring around in one video game or another, I tend to enjoy such pursuits as educating myself on topics that interest me, reading, napping, watching the occasional Anime or Movie (recently finally gotten around to watching Oppenheimer and Twisters. Enjoyed both. May re-watch The Expanse), or entertaining myself with weather forecasting (which I enjoy unironically, I should have gone into that career field...) My music tastes are as nuanced as my interests.

Politically, I'm something of a different beast compared to most in the US. I tend to get along rather swimmingly with most, even if I fully acknowledge that my perfect utopia has no chance of existing in this current place of space and time. I digress. I do enjoy the occasional debate, philosophizing, and various other intellectual/scholastic pursuits.

Otherwise, I'm just your average dude, wandering around, exploring his options, and seeing if there is a potential individual with romantic inclinations. Being on the shorter side (5'6"") I usually have to compensate for a good (albeit often dark or gallows) sense of humor and a reasonable wit. If I delve too much further, I'll unveil all, so I'll leave it here. Feel free to chat... DM... whichever method of communication seems to be working on Reddit on any given day.

Back story: A mutual connection on X dropped into my DM‚Äôs. We support the same team etc so it was easy to strike a conversation. It quickly moved onto other topics and we swapped multiple messages every day of the week for months. During this time I asked if she wanted to meet for a coffee.

You see, our mouths are bustling metropolises of bacteria, and while most are harmless, some are, shall we say, a bit stinky. These bacteria feast on food particles and dead cells, producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) ‚Äì the real culprits behind bad breath.

### The Usual Suspects: Common Causes of Bad Breath

- **Poor Oral Hygiene:** This one‚Äôs a no-brainer. Skipping brushing and flossing allows plaque and food particles to accumulate, providing a buffet for odor-causing bacteria.
- **Gum Disease:** Gingivitis and periodontitis (advanced gum disease) create pockets between your gums and teeth, becoming cozy hideouts for bacteria and leading to chronic bad breath.
- **Food Choices:** Garlic, onions, and certain spices are notorious for leaving their pungent mark on your breath. These foods contain sulfur compounds that are absorbed into the bloodstream and released through your lungs.
- **Dry Mouth:** Saliva is your mouth‚Äôs natural cleaning crew, washing away food particles and neutralizing acids. Conditions like dry mouth (xerostomia) reduce saliva production, paving the way for bacterial growth and bad breath.
- **Medical Conditions:** In some cases, bad breath can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions like diabetes, respiratory infections, or liver or kidney problems.

Does Deep Cleaning Help Bad Breath: Delving into the Depths
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now, let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks: what exactly *is* a deep cleaning, and can it banish bad breath for good? A dental deep cleaning, also known as scaling and root planing, is a non-surgical procedure that targets the source of the problem ‚Äì plaque and tartar buildup below the gum line. Think of it as a spring cleaning for your mouth.

### Scaling and Root Planing: A Dynamic Duo

- **Scaling:** This involves removing plaque and tartar from the tooth surfaces, both above and below the gum line. Special instruments are used to gently scrape away these deposits, leaving your teeth squeaky clean.
- **Root Planing:** This step smooths the surfaces of the tooth roots, making it harder for bacteria to latch on and multiply. It also helps the gums to reattach to the teeth properly.

### Does Deep Cleaning Help Bad Breath? The Verdict

So, does deep cleaning actually work its magic on bad breath? In many cases, absolutely! By removing the bacterial breeding grounds lurking beneath the gums, deep cleaning can significantly improve breath freshness. It‚Äôs particularly effective for those struggling with gum disease, which, as we‚Äôve discussed, is a major contributor to halitosis. However, deep cleaning isn't a magic bullet. If your bad breath is caused by other factors, like dry mouth or a medical condition, addressing those underlying issues is crucial for long-term fresh breath.

Does Deep Cleaning Help Bad Breath: Beyond the Dentist's Chair
--------------------------------------------------------------

While professional deep cleaning is a powerful weapon against bad breath, it's not a one-and-done solution. Maintaining good oral hygiene habits at home is essential for keeping those pesky VSC-producing bacteria at bay.

### Home Remedies and Preventative Measures

1. **Brush and Floss Religiously:** Brush your teeth for two minutes, twice a day, using fluoride toothpaste. Don't forget to floss daily to remove plaque and food debris from between your teeth and along the gum line. Think of it as evicting those smelly squatters from your mouth!
2. **Tongue Scraping: A Game Changer:** Believe it or not, your tongue can harbor a surprising amount of bacteria. Using a tongue scraper can significantly reduce the bacterial load and freshen your breath. Think of it as giving your tongue a deep clean detox.
3. **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps stimulate saliva production, keeping your mouth moist and washing away bacteria. Dry mouth is like a desert for bacteria, so quench that thirst and keep the bacterial party at bay.
4. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing sugar-free gum after meals can help increase saliva flow and remove food particles, offering a quick breath refresh.
5. **Watch Your Diet:** Limiting your intake of odor-causing foods, like garlic and onions, can go a long way in preventing bad breath.
6. **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visiting your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings is essential for maintaining good oral health and preventing bad breath. Your dentist can identify any potential issues early on and recommend appropriate treatment. They‚Äôre like your mouth‚Äôs personal bodyguard, keeping those bad breath villains in check.
7. **Consider a Mouthwash:** Therapeutic mouthwashes can help kill bacteria and neutralize odors, offering a temporary breath boost. However, they shouldn‚Äôt replace brushing and flossing.

Addressing Other Potential Causes
---------------------------------

- **Dry Mouth Solutions:** If you suffer from dry mouth, your dentist may recommend artificial saliva products or medications to stimulate saliva production.
- **Medical Consultations:** If your dentist suspects that your bad breath is related to an underlying medical condition, they may recommend consulting with your physician for further evaluation and treatment.

Does Deep Cleaning Help Bad Breath: A Breath of Fresh Air?
----------------------------------------------------------

So, does deep cleaning help bad breath? The answer, in a nutshell, is a resounding ""it can!"" Deep cleaning tackles the root cause of many bad breath woes by eliminating the bacterial havens beneath your gums. Coupled with a consistent oral hygiene routine and addressing any underlying medical conditions, deep cleaning can be a game-changer in your quest for fresher breath. Remember, achieving and maintaining fresh breath is a marathon, not a sprint. By taking proactive steps and working closely with your dental professional, you can confidently say goodbye to bad breath and hello to a brighter, more confident smile. Now, go forth and breathe easy!

She's not a hoarder, but every corner, shelf, cupboard & surface is covered in stuff. She has duplicates & triplicates of everything.

Hume AI's recent launch of OCTAVE seems to be steering us in that direction, enabling objects and digital content to have a voice. This technology could revolutionize how we interact with our surroundings, but it also raises intriguing questions about our relationship with the inanimate.

The concept of giving voice to everyday objects is undeniably fascinating. It opens up a realm of possibilities for personalized experiences, making our interactions more engaging. Picture a world where your fridge reminds you of expiration dates or your car provides you with real-time traffic updates in a friendly tone. It feels almost like stepping into a sci-fi movie where technology seamlessly blends into our lives.

However, there's a flip side to this innovation. Are we risking over-automation, where the charm of human interaction fades away? The idea of having conversations with objects could lead to a detachment from the real world. What happens to our social skills if we start relying on machines for companionship? 

As we embrace this new wave of technology, it‚Äôs essential to ponder the implications it brings. Could this be a blessing that enhances our daily lives, or are we opening a Pandora's box of dependency on artificial voices?

-Difficulty sleeping because I wake up after deep sleep (about 4 hours) with itchy ears and skin, elevated HR if I just roll over in bed, overheating/hot flashes in the middle of the night. Night sweats - these usually happen when I‚Äôm on my period specifically but can be any time. I find it difficult to go back to sleep and if I do it‚Äôs interrupted.
-Little to no appetite despite feeling starving and regularly under-eating without trying to. I‚Äôve lost a fair amount of weight and it‚Äôs starting to concern me. Small amounts of food, just a couple hundred calories, make me feel stuffed for hours on end. Even when I‚Äôm hungry the thought of food and chewing makes me gag. I used to be such a foodie and really enjoyed eating so this one is particularly painful.
-More frequent bowel movements. This one makes no sense to me. I‚Äôm eating significantly less, I‚Äôd say half what I used to in a day, and going number 2 4-5 times a day sometimes (all solid).

I‚Äôm starting to feel extremely sleep deprived and malnourished. I‚Äôve been taking supplements daily all year: Allegra, D, Zinc, B complex, sea moss, turmeric, ashwaganda, quercetin, berberine, acetylcholine, probiotic, turmeric/curcumin, and recently started Pepcid AC. I also drink an electrolyte powder in water daily. Sometimes I take Benadryl to help with sleep. I also completely cut out coffee, alcohol, and vaping/nicotine, since February. Thinking of cutting caffeine entirely but my green tea is the only joy I have left. I‚Äôve been testing different foods in my diet that hinder me and kicking them out too: eggs, most grains, citrus fruits, processed carbs, tomatoes, avocado, butter, and most cheese. 

I‚Äôm exhausted and I feel like I‚Äôve been doing everything in my power to prevent this and yet, here I am, posting this on Christmas Eve out of sheer desperation. Once again, got 2.5 hours of sleep, and sobbed on my bathroom floor in the middle of the night after hours of tossing and turning. My husband can‚Äôt sleep either because I‚Äôm so hot at night it makes him hot too. I feel like a burden. 

Is there anything you all would recommend that I‚Äôm not already doing? Any recs would be great. Doctor is not an option right now as my husband was let go from his job a month ago and I was on his insurance (I‚Äôm self-employed, so no health benefits unless I buy them myself and haven‚Äôt gotten to that point yet).

1hlemc3,https://i.redd.it/jm6gbkyr3t8e1.jpeg,Theory on Roaring Kitty and TLRY Connection ,"Theory on Roaring Kitty and TLRY Connection

I didn't want to go down this rabbit hole...but I think I found some more clues that connects Roaring Kitty to the TLRY theory. Maybe it's a crazy coincidence, maybe I'm just making it up because I want it to be true, who knows. But I think Roaring Kitty left us clues about switching to TLRY in his last YouTube live video from June. Here's why: 

1. At 8:35 he starts by saying, ""you gotta do the switch"". He's talking about switching from coffee to beer, but anyone who knows this guy knows he's talking in code because the feds are always watching him. He then goes on to say, ""It's time to make a switch"".  
2. He then holds up a can of beer, but the green screen causes you to not be able to see it because the can itself is entirely the color green. He continues by saying, ""Can you see it? That's a hint but you can't see it."". You're able to make out the word ""Green"" on the bottom of the can, which he later confirms with his chat. 
3. I looked it up, and it's a beer called ""Green"" made by the brewing company, Treehouse Brewing Company. Green? Trees? AKA, WEED. Also, this might be a stretch, but the acronym for this company is basically THC...just saying. 
4. TLRY has been acquiring a bunch of craft brewing companies for the past couple of years. It's very possible that they could be in the works of acquiring Treehouse. Maybe he knows about this somehow? 



I think his YouTube video was just a way for him to very subtly tell everyone that he is going to switch to a new stock. Throughout the video he kept saying, ""reserve the right to change your mind"", and I think he's referring to changing from GME to TLRY. He later shows his GME positions, and he was holding a ton of calls with a $20 strike that expired on 6/20. Maybe he rolled them, maybe he executed them, who really knows. But I think he knew he was going to cash them out and take a new position on a different stock...TLRY.

1hlefb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1hlefb5/im_90_better_how_i_did_itwhat_brought_relief/,I'm 90% better - how I did it/what brought relief,"My story is the same as many other people's story. Years of pain and discomfort, years of taking antibiotics that didn't help, not knowing if I would ever recover. I got tested for just about everything under the sun - I had CT scans, pelvic ultrasounds, STI panel screenings, cystoscopy, etc. Eventually, in desperation at age 31, I had a hysterectomy (everything but my ovaries). The doctor who did the surgery discovered that I have both endometriosis and PCOS, so after surgery I started on a combination birth control pill called Larin Fe 1/20. And this pill has been nothing short of a miracle drug.

I take it continuously, only the active pills. If I stop taking the medication, my symptoms eventually come back after it works its way out of my system. I also went vegan in September, about a month after my operation, and that seems to be making a difference as well. I drink coffee every day but I strictly avoid alcohol, dairy, and hot sauce. If I lapse and have a grilled cheese sandwich with sriracha or something like that, it can trigger urgency symptoms. I avoid alcohol because it triggers hot flashes and migraines for me, but also because if I get drunk I'll start eating anything I can get my hands on and that's bad news for my bladder. 

I don't fully understand the science behind it, but I am thinking that I may have some additional endometriosis that wasn't found during the hysterectomy, or a hormonal imbalance caused by the PCOS that was contributing to my pain. Low estrogen can cause urinary problems, so it may be that the estrogen in the pill is helping me feel better. I think there could also be some underlying lactose intolerance or another digestive issue that impacts everything else down there. 

I'm sure that this is not the solution for everyone, but if I can help one other person by sharing what worked for me, I'm happy. I feel a million times better and actually have my life back.

1hledx2,https://i.redd.it/nl04jr6j1t8e1.png,Is the Smaller Thumbnail Layout on YouTube a Bug or an Update?,"

Hi everyone,

I recently noticed that the thumbnails on my YouTube homepage are much smaller than they used to be. Previously, they were displayed in a larger, full-display layout, which made browsing videos much easier. Now, the thumbnails look compressed, and it‚Äôs harder to see video details clearly.

I‚Äôm unsure if this is a bug or a new update YouTube is testing. If it‚Äôs a bug, does anyone know how to fix it? I‚Äôve already tried updating the app, clearing the cache, and even reinstalling it, but nothing has worked so far.

If it‚Äôs an update, is there any way to revert to the older thumbnail layout? The current setup really impacts usability, and I‚Äôd prefer the previous design.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I know there's practically nothing I can do about coming in to contact with them, but does anyone have any experience asking for extra sick time? Is there a way to go about petitioning the company for this somewhat special circumstance? I know a lot of our partners feel the same way and we deserve some kind of extra benefit or protection for this, especially during cold/flu/covid season.

We've tried unionized in the past and failed, and we're about to reach our year since the vote so we might try again, but are there any options other than that?",21,1735049643.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.9,False

Im 22 years old, male, 189cm in height (6'2 I think?) weigh 95kg approximately, in okay shape with some muscle and a little fat on top. I dont take any medications and dont take any drugs. Medical issues that could be related would be getting itchy when sweat glands start working, and I used to have dematographia (any scratches or skin irritation would damage the blood vessels and make the affected area swell up within a minute and go away within 15 minutes.)  
The reason its a problem is because it doesnt go away unless they get scratched and form friction blisters, which can be annoying and get painful, especially when they open up. Its a sort of deep itch, right under the skin. Its more common when Ive drank coffee recently, or more than usual. Cant say that thats the cause, but there might be a correlation.
