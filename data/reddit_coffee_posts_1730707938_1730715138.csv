Im very interested in buying a gaming laptop and wanted to pick people‚Äôs brains who know far better than I do.

Ive owned a Steam Deck for about 2 years and I really like it for certain games. Especially for emulation and older games that are very handheld friendly. Obviously, the deck has its limits and i‚Äôm finding that it doesn‚Äôt adequately handle some new games I want to play (even on low settings) and some of the more processor heavy games I like to play strategy wise.

Ive never owned a gaming laptop before because I usually build my own gaming PC. Im very happy with my gaming PC but I constantly travel on the weekends back home. I take the train each weekend and visit folks. I don‚Äôt think streaming is appropriate because the steam deck wifi plus the internet at home and where I travel isn‚Äôt good enough. I also find streaming to be cumbersome when outside my house in general. I also like gaming in coffee shops and the deck isn‚Äôt very good at wifi in my honest opinion.

So, I was thinking of a gaming laptop. Ive tried doing some research already. Ideally i‚Äôm looking at a 4080 GPU with expandable ram and storage. Something around the 2000 GBP mark (under affordable 0 % finance options) . I think I need advice on what to avoid and be aware of as a newbie looking. Im not after my desktop performance but portable directly. This is not realistic. I will also use this laptop (ideally) for 5+ years and as a work/general laptop as well as i‚Äôm a medic (in training).

Open to all advice and questions. Everything is helpful.

Hi there! I know this community often shares stories of online connections turning into real-life relationships, but I find myself in the opposite situation and could use some advice.

A few months back, in late July, I matched with a woman on Tinder while she was on vacation in my town. We hit it off immediately when we met for coffee, spending nearly three hours talking. There was no awkwardness; we explored each other‚Äôs lives, cultures, and careers. We discovered we both work in computing, share similar backgrounds (she‚Äôs from a neighboring country to my father‚Äôs), and both love traveling and learning languages.

She‚Äôs fluent in Arabic, French, and English, while I‚Äôm learning Arabic and Spanish. I found it adorable when she would blush and fumble for words in English, often switching to French when she got flustered. I complimented her a few times, and while she thanked me, she admitted she wasn‚Äôt used to receiving compliments, which I understood given her cultural background.

After coffee, we exchanged numbers and squeezed in a quick lunch before she had to fly home. We talked about her vacation, and I told her I wanted to take her out for dinner when she returned, to which she happily agreed.

Since she returned home, we‚Äôve been texting every few days. She often sends me video reels showcasing different parts of my country, and I respond by saying I‚Äôll take her there someday. In return, she shares reels from her home, and I playfully asked, ‚ÄúAre you trying to tempt me to visit?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúHaha, yes‚Ä¶ you caught me. You won‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù We chat about random things and just keep up with each other.

I‚Äôve thought about her a lot over the past few months, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt been so reserved towards her. I constantly grapple with how I could make a relationship work if she feels the same way.

	‚Ä¢	Distance: While there‚Äôs a significant distance, I work remotely and am in a good financial position due to real estate investments. I could travel to see her, and she‚Äôs mentioned she could see herself living in my country someday.
	‚Ä¢	Cultural Connection: She is Muslim, and while I believe in God, I don‚Äôt currently follow a religion. However, I‚Äôve developed a strong interest in my culture and have been learning about Islam this year, envisioning it playing a significant role in my future.
	‚Ä¢	Her Situation: Given her being quite private, there‚Äôs a chance she may not even be single anymore, especially after three months.

I want to express my feelings to her and find out if she has any romantic interest in me. Our relationship has been more of a friendship with some light flirting, but I‚Äôm unsure how to approach this.

Any advice on how I should proceed would be really appreciated.

For a newly opened business, this cafe stall seemed they know what they were doing. Lami ang coffee, locally sourced from lantapan, they use high quality sweeteners and milk. I ordered Iced Americano, I was not dissappointed, sa price I got it less than 120 pero buy1take1, you could opt for the solo and mas cheaper siya. Definitely you got much more than you paid. 

The place kay near sa kalsada atbang jud sa rose pharmacy crossing Iponan, but very comfortable, pang main character ang vibes. I recommend this place for a quick change of scenery.

1gjaow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShenzhenSocial/comments/1gjaow3/4_day_itinerary_traveling_to_shenzhen/,4 Day Itinerary - Traveling to Shenzhen,"So first of all understand the Geography of Shenzhen, it's unlike Guangzhou, Beijing, or Shanghai. Shenzhen has many city centers or downtowns cos it‚Äôs a planned city unlike Shanghai for instance so each district has everything, a city center especially. I would suggest you divide four days to explore 4 areas. ¬† I have lived in Shenzhen for 4 years now and love exploration.¬†

**Day 1 in Futian:**¬†

Explore the main city center area, and walk from Gangxia North Metro station to Shopping Park, which is around 1.5 KM. In this area, there are 7 Shopping malls, beautiful infrastructure, and a lot of food. Make sure to check it LINK CITY, it's an underground market starting from One Avenue (near Gangxia North Exit 7 Station) to Shopping Park. Make sure to Check out Upper Hills (Pinyin: Shenye Shangcheng) There is a huge mall that connects to Lianhua Shan Park on the 5th Floor, it's a super nice place to walk around. Enter the mall and go directly to the 5th Floor. Also check out the Civic Center Area, beautiful landscape. Explore OCT, its neighborhood developed on a hilly area in Futian, with a lot of cute cafes, studios, and restaurants there. You can also check out HuaQiangBei Market, the biggest electronic market. All the best places mentioned above are pretty close to each other, maybe within a 6 KM radius, except OCT.¬†

**2. Day 2 in Nanshan:**¬†

Nanshan is more about Tech, most of the Chinese Tech Giants' head offices are located here. Head to High-tech Park metro station on line 1, you can find a lot here, first of all, a beautiful shopping area, you don't need to buy you guys can walk around :p There is a Western food street here too where you can find good pizzas and coffee. I would say, this is the center of Nanshan and it's big, you can easily spend more than a half day here. Feel free to visit my office for a coffee or we can make some Chinese tea, it‚Äôs in the same area :p In the evening you can head to the Houhai area and see the pen or bullet-shaped building, and a luxury shopping area next to it. You can also go to Shenzhen Bay Park from this spot, This park stretches from Shekou to XiaSha in Futian, if you guys are a big-time walkers, I would suggest this walk, it's long but nice. In the evening you can also head to Shekou, (Sea World Station). Where you will find most of the foreigners, non-Chinese food, and some bars and clubs, there is a park next to the ocean here as well. It‚Äôs also a nice area to walk around. I think you guys can easily spend 2-3 days exploring Futian and Nanshan Districts.¬†



**3. Day 3 in Louhe and Yantian:**¬†

On the third day, you can head to Louhe District, Louhe was the first district that developed when Shenzhen started to shape itself as a city but it feels older than Futian and Nanshan but packs tons of food options, and some old buildings. You can spend the morning in Louhe and head to WuTong Shan or WuTong Mountain, it‚Äôs a huge mountain area that has a lot going on inside. There is a temple, a botanical park, extremely beautiful, some playgrounds, and a small village on the west side of the mountain with a river, that‚Äôs like a small art town with some galleries. There are also many resorts with great views.  
  
**4. Day 4 - Dedicate it to the Ocean:**

Shenzhen also has many beautiful beaches. Surely check out DaMeiSha Beach, and the park connected to the beach area. This is easily accessible by metro. It‚Äôs near Yantian district or maybe it‚Äôs a part of Yantian District, but DON‚ÄôT GO there on the weekend or you will regret that. Afterward surely go check out the XiChong Beach or Mooon Beach Club, better go there on the weekend if you like to party on the Beach. This Area consists of many beaches, There are some bars and restaurants on this beach area. Before heading to the Mooon Beach Area, stop by ‚ÄòThe Brew Farm‚Äô it‚Äôs a restaurant located on top of a hill that got some very scenic restaurants built on European-style architecture (maybe)? it‚Äôs in the middle of Dameisha and Mooon beach area. For more accurate locations feel free to DM.

1gjaof1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gjaof1/i_27f_found_msgs_he_25m_sent_about_wanting_to/,I (27F) found msgs he (25M) sent about wanting to sleep with other girls. Claims it‚Äôs just how the group talked & made really unhinged ‚Äòjokes‚Äô. Is this cheating? ,"I apologise and thank you for reading and sharing your insights on this long post. Would also hope to hear some guys POVs as i‚Äôve mostly spoken in depth only to girlfriends. I‚Äôd really appreciate all perspectives and thoughts on this.

I met my bf a year ago through work and we hit it off really well as friends. he did a lot for me while we were friends - the little actions and gestures, always taking care of me when i was drunk or unwell, noticing when i‚Äôm not okay or when im tired he‚Äôd get me coffee when i was on my period pads and chocolates and candy. And yet never doing anyth that made me feel uncomfortable.

Fast forward a couple months we started dating and he was the most loving partner. this rs felt like a fairytale a dream. we were just so happy for the entirety of our rs. things felt so magical with him and i was the happiest i‚Äôve ever been.

Everyone was happy for us my friends were so so happy that i‚Äôve found real love, his friends would always tell me how they‚Äôve nv seen him like this - this happy and shy talking abt me, and he‚Äôd been tellin em bout me from the start. The effort he put into planning dates and gettin gifts and flowers which they were most shocked by cus they‚Äôd nvr seen him buy flowers for anyone, he used to say its the biggest waste of money. 

I was in the happiest place of my life and i rly felt like he was the one. Until one day while we were on a short trip and he was asleep, i couldn‚Äôt get any service so i used his phone and saw notis from group chat on tele. I knew that group of guys as some of his closest friends but never met them. 

Curious i clicked into it and it was like opening a Pandora‚Äôs box.

A bit of context he and this group of guys used to fly to Thailand v frequently the past few years to find girls and have um,,fun. Most times in this KTV let‚Äôs call it place X where they could pay girls and engage sex work. (I wasn‚Äôt aware until i found out from the chat.) I read a lot was having a whole mental breakdown but just to name a few:

1. The friends were saying they miss the old him, he‚Äôs boring after he‚Äôs attached and they can‚Äôt go to Thailand and play around tgt anymore. He said ‚Äòi wish i could go with yall lol now i gotta bring my gf along fuck‚Ä¶.. Going w my gf would suck i won‚Äôt be able to enjoy and also if we go to place X i‚Äôd have to wear a cap and hide my face in case we run into one of my girls.‚Äô

2. ‚ÄúIf i could go again with yall alone, i‚Äôll rape A, lick B‚Äôs tits, suck C‚Äôs toes‚Äù his exact words, A, B, and C being different sex workers names.

3. He encouraged one of his married friends (who‚Äôs cheating on his wife with one of the sex workers in X) to bring his wife along, and then he‚Äôll bring me along. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll have 2 wives and i‚Äôll have 9 gfs Lol‚Äù

4. One night i was out with one of my best friends at a bar and she‚Äôs an influencer - gorgeous and hot. He sent a picture of her into the chat and said i was out w her and that I‚Äôd be going over to his afterwards. ‚ÄúHope she comes over too that‚Äôll be neat‚Äù

5. He had cleared his entire gallery of nudes and sex tapes etc when we got together. In the chat he said ‚Äúfuck my gallery‚Äôs so fuckin clean now no nudes no tapes no nothin, countin on yall to save them for me‚Äù

6. He edited a picture of this warship with my face and the faces of all the other girls he slept with i guess. That part of the chat they were really just having a blast talking about the girls he fucked and how he placed me at the top deck now cause i‚Äôm ‚Äúranked no.1 overlooking the rest‚Äù.

I read way too much but these were the worst ones. Needless to say i couldn‚Äôt believe what i was reading, who is this guy sleeping next to me i couldn‚Äôt recognise him anymore i felt like I trusted the wrong person.  I felt so shattered.

I broke down and left and confronted him through text as i couldn‚Äôt get any word out in person. i sent all the screenshots over and he immediately began apologising saying it was all just a joke. That he really loves me so fucking much, he never meant anything of what he said, it was how his group joked around. Which part of any of that could have possibly been a joke?

I felt disrespected, degraded, objectified, humiliated; most importantly i felt like the entire relationship was a lie and he never loved me. how could u be saying stuff like that if you really loved someone? We cut the trip short and went back home, I left to be alone. The entire time he was crying, begging, apologising, blaming himself.

2 of his childhood friends heard about what happened from him and came to speak to me. Said he really isn‚Äôt at all like that with them and that it is obvious to anyone how much he loves me. They didn‚Äôt defend or justify what he did and they all agreed its horrible and messed up but they just told me they know how genuine he is with me, and they know that bunch personally and yea theyre a fucked up bunch that they wouldn‚Äôt wanna mix with. Maybe it was bad company or they really just always joked like that and he didn‚Äôt wanna lose them as friends and kept the ‚Äòjokes‚Äô going.

As of today we‚Äôve sat down to talk a few times. He apologised endlessly, begged for forgiveness, he said it‚Äôs no excuse but just for a little clarity on why he did that -  they had been friends since young and all they ever talked about was girls and fucked up stuff abt girls and he admitted he didn‚Äôt wanna be ‚Äòoutcasted‚Äô because he‚Äôs serious w me and no longer wanting to play like how they all used to.

Said he‚Äôs aware now how messed up it was and how he was a shit bf. That that isn‚Äôt who he rly is he was just wired to talk in that manner w that group and the real him is how he is with everyone else and how he‚Äôs been with me. And that he will do whatever it takes to chase me back, that he has cut them off, he‚Äôll report everything to me and let me check his phone whenever, be full transparency. That he‚Äôll never do anyth to hurt me again.

At this point i‚Äôm just rly rly lost and deeply hurt. i‚Äôve seen his efforts in trying to get me back,I can feel his love but with what happened i just question everyth we ever had. i‚Äôve nv once felt the need to check his phone or for him to ‚Äòreport‚Äô to me but tbh i feel like i would be so insecure and so paranoid about everyth moving forward. is he just sorry cause he got caught? What if he just learns to hide it better after?

I‚Äôm so conflicted because everyone who knew him and who saw us said our love was just so genuine. my friends all loved him and my family did too, they all saw how he treated me and trusted him.

i don‚Äôt know if this is something worth forgiving, it‚Äôs just so unacceptable to me bc i would never say anything like that ‚Äòas a joke‚Äô or to fit in if i truly loved someone. I‚Äôve had my own phases n it makes me think was he js fkn around w me? But at the same time i dont know if i‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion because he didn‚Äôt actually cheat.  Is this considered cheating? It feels on par with cheating to me.

should this one incident of some text messages sent outweigh all the good in our rs and how he‚Äôs treated me so far. But at the same time even if i were to give him another chance, what if i can‚Äôt ever put it behind me? 

TLDR: I found out my bf whom i thought was the sweetest most loving bf had a group chat where he talked about crude stuff like wanting to rape and sleep with other girls. Upon confrontation he apologised a lot said it was just a joke it‚Äôs just to fit in. I‚Äôm torn‚Äî I love him sm but feel betrayed and wonder if i can ever trust him again, questioning if his actions are forgivable or if i should end things. if this is cheating or really a stupid mistake.

I will start the post but those who have been through it please feel free to add.

PRE-SURGERY

1.¬†Therapist ‚Äì If you and your partner are struggling mentally or not sleeping or are worried sick, I would strongly recommend searching out a therapist. My wife and I went 3 times over a 6-week period and the therapist provided us with some coping tools. To be honest, just talking it out loud with someone who has no real skin in the game helped a lot. We both immediately felt better after each session even if it was only for a couple of days before sinking back into the funk. Just a break from feeling how you are feeling was helpful.

Mine gave me a piece of advice that I would use at 3am in the morning when I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Don‚Äôt live in the past because you will live with regret. Don‚Äôt live in the future because you will live with anxiety. Just live right now, whatever time it is right now just live in it because everything is OK. That‚Äôs especially true at 3am. Right now Im lying bed, I‚Äôm alive, I feel ok, I‚Äôm in no pain. Nothing has changed what-so-ever other than the news that I have prostate cancer.

2.¬†¬†Pelvic Floor Physio ‚Äì seek one out and get proper training on Kegel exercises (you may think you are doing them right, but you probably are not!) and pelvic floor exercises. ¬†Get started with these asap. Do them religiously. They can tell between 2 visits if you are doing them correctly and what the improvement is. I started doing mine on the bed with pillow in-between legs etc. But once you have mastered them you can do it sitting in the car, standing etc etc

3.¬†Electric Kegel Stimulation - I bought one. Its not a replacement for doing them manually but I did use one before and after as part of my routine.

4.¬†Squeezy App ‚Äì Can be found on the App Store for your phone. Pay for the paid version, it‚Äôs worth it. You can use the apps preset but my Pelvic Floor Physio and I set up the app manually for the exercises they wanted me to do. It will help you as well as remind you when they need to be done so you don‚Äôt forget. Brilliant App and recommended by my surgeon.

It also has a bladder diary. I also recommend using it. I monitored my drinking and urine for 1 week. Discovered I was not drinking enough water, and I was drinking too late at night. I was basically 2 litres in and 2 litres out. Knowing how much came out during the night allowed me to better plan for emptying the catheter bag later.

5.¬†Drinking - Cut my coffee from 5 or 6 cups a day to 1 cup. Stopped drinking soda completely. Started drinking more water with a tiny bit of sugar free cordial just to give the water some taste. Bought a 1 litre water bottle with preprinted times on it so I would basically drink 200ml every 1 hour (obviously I topped it up twice a day at least).

6.¬†Fitness ‚Äì Try and get at least 10,000 steps a day for a few weeks because this is what I used to get to 10,000 steps by day 10 post surgery. The fitter and thinner you are, the better off you will be. If you are over weight (I was not) lose as much weight as you can in the time you have got before surgery.

7.¬†TRAVEL BIDET - Please see next section



POST SURGERY ‚Äì HOSPITAL

(I was in 3 nights because my surgery was 9.00pm on the ‚Äúfirst night‚Äù)

1.¬†Heat Pad ‚Äì buy one of those bean filled heat pads you can heat up in the microwave. I had Retzius Sparing RALP so I was partly inverted for 3.5 hours during surgery. They fill you up with gas so that it pushes organs out of the way to create space for surgeon to work in. My shoulders and neck ached unbelievably bad for about 2 weeks. The nurses would heat it up for me and I used at home after discharge

2.¬†Compression Socks ‚Äì Not all compression socks are created equal. The hospital will give you a pair and I asked for 3 additional pairs to take home (more about this in next section).

3.¬†Entertainment ‚Äì I was blown away with my hospital entertainment. I had Netflix and every other streaming platform you can imagine. As long as you had your own logins you could use. But if your hospital doesn‚Äôt then bring an iPad or something. Nurses were waking me up 2 or 3 times during the night to take readings so often I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so having some entertainment was excellent

4.¬†Walking ‚Äì I tried to walk 12 hours after surgery, bad move. They had to wheelchair me 10 metres back to the room haha. But 20 hours after surgery I started walking the corridor. By 48 hours I was walking a couple of laps. You need to get moving.



POST SURGERY ‚Äì HOME (Catheter In)

(My case was a little different because I live in Malaysia and had my surgery done in Melbourne Australia and my hometown is Adelaide Australia. I had to stay 10 days in Melbourne before the catheter was removed. Surgeon did not want my flying 9 hours back to Malaysia, so I also rented a house in Adelaide for 8 weeks)

1.¬†BED - We had 2 single beds in my serviced apartment. It‚Äôs almost impossible to lie flat so we took the thick seat cushions from the sofa (not the little cushions, the ones you actually sit on) and placed them between the boxspring and the mattress at the head of the bed. This basically propped the entire bed mattress up about 15 degrees. It created enough bend from waist up that it was comfortable to sleep, prevented me from rolling over and enough gravity for the catheter to drain properly during the night. It was also easier for me to get myself out of bed by myself. It was 100 times better than just using pillows etc.

2.¬†SHOWER - They gave me two catheter bags. When I took a shower I disconnected the bag completely and just let any little urine flow out while I was washing myself. I would wash out the bag and leave it to dry and replace it with the other bag. I did this every day. It was easier than trying to shower with the bag and I suspect more hygienic as the bags were cleaned out daily.

3.¬†PEEING ‚Äì The catheter bag has a valve at the bottom to drain the bag. After you empty it. Close the valve, check the valve, check the valve again. I didn‚Äôt shut it off 3 times. I was only aware that I didn‚Äôt when I started to panic the bag was not filling only to find out there was a pool of urine on the flow where I was sitting or when I was walking and wondering why my sock was soaking wet!

4.¬†TOILET ‚Äì Ok, God did not bless me with a 357 Magnum down there. More like a 44 Snub Nose Revolver (thanks for nothing God). When taking a dump, make sure the fire-arm is pointing down!!! Urine comes out outside of the tube and if you‚Äôre not careful you can have a stream reach the other side of the bathroom. As Geroge Costanza once told Jerry, pulp can fly baby!

5.¬†TOILET ‚Äì This is where the aforementioned Portable Travel Bidet comes in handy. With the tube hanging out, the extended stomach because of gas, stool softeners and sore ass etc its difficult to get in there and keep clean after finally doing your Big Business. This was actually a great buy. Just fill it and spray, one wipe to dry, done!

6.¬†TOILET ‚Äì Don‚Äôt wait to start taking the stool softeners and keep on them even when you finally pop the initial cork! I think it was finally Day 5 or 6 for me. Don‚Äôt strain, they tell you over and over. But I did a mini strain, it hurt like hell. Felt like I tore a stomach muscle. I called my surgeon and told him, he laughed and said I told you. No damage done but that side hurt a bit longer.

7.¬†EAT ‚Äì Soups and Salads. It‚Äôs all about the Big Business aka taking a dump. Plenty of fluids and take the Tylenol/Panadol consistently even when you don‚Äôt think you need it. Just because it keeps the pain away. It‚Äôs harder to get rid of pain then keep it away.

8.¬†BAG PLACEMENT ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have a bucket, so we just put a towel on the floor and put the bag on it when I went to bed. Make sure the tube is not twisted and make sure you have gravity to drain. You will be shocked that this large bag can fill up so much overnight. The first couple of nights I would wake at around 4am to find it close to full. This is where the previous bladder diary came into play.

9.¬†CATHETER ‚Äì super annoying. Uncomfortable at best, painful at worse. I used the pads I bought to wrap around my old fellows tip. Not because I was super worried about leaking but it provided a cushion between the tip, the hose and my underwear. Also I was leaking a little bit of yucky fluidy stuff from tip and outside of the tube, so that was soaked up by the pad and not into my underwear. It also helped keep the old fellow and tube in place so it didn‚Äôt rub as much.

10.¬†ILLNESS ‚Äì if you feel like you‚Äôre getting a cold/allergy or whatever get straight into the cough medicine. Coughing/Sneezing is no laughing matter in that first week.

11.¬†WALK, WALK and WALK ‚Äì I set a goal of incremental 1000 steps per day after I checked out of hospital. So, I walked the hotel corridor 1000 steps (over 5 or 6 separate walks every hour and a half) day 1. By day 10 I was doing 10,000 steps (over 7 or 8 walks per day every hour)

12.¬†COMPRESSION SOCKS ‚Äì wear them 24 hours a day

¬†

POST SURGERY ‚Äì HOME (Catheter Out)

(At this point I‚Äôm now back in my rental house in Adelaide)

1.¬†LIFTING - Don‚Äôt lift anything over 5kg for 6 weeks

2.¬†COMPRESSION SOCKS ‚Äì My surgeon asked me to wear my Compression socks for 6 weeks. For the first 3 weeks full time. Then the last 3 weeks just to bed. In a previous post I talked about my Accountant friend who did not wear his or was not told to wear them. He developed blood clots and was back in Hospital. His recovery was greatly impacted.

3.¬†WALK, WALK and WALK ‚Äì I maintained my 10,000 steps and by week 6 was doing around 20,000 steps

4.¬†DRINK ‚Äì Keep up the fluids you need to clean out the pipes!

5.¬†BLOOD ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be scared to see pink fluid and even blood scabs in your urine for even a month. You can be clear pee for 1 week then suddenly its pink or you see blood or you see scabs in it. Don‚Äôt be worried, this is all normal.

6.¬†Don‚Äôt rush back to work. You are probably feeling fine. The scars are starting to heal. You are holding your urine ok etc. But don‚Äôt forget you have had major surgery. The surgeon has moved around major organs just to get to your prostate. They have removed it, stitched things together etc. Don‚Äôt be the hero. Your body needs major recovery. You stuff up anything right now and it can set you back months in terms of continence etc

7.¬†CIALIS ‚Äì If you can get 5mg tabs, take them every day for as long as you can. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to get the generics easily and cost effectively. I‚Äôm still taking them 8 months post-surgery because I still can‚Äôt (and possibly wont ever) get erections. Its not about sex its about health down there and blood flow etc

¬†Ok, I will add more as and when I think of them. If anyone else has tips and tricks, please post here for those who are getting ready for this.",1,1730713518.0,ProstateCancer,0,1.0,False

I (29m) have a friend (28f) who I have known from waaay back, when we were about 18. We met online, and we felt there was a weird, strong connection between us, but it did not move forward at any point then. We've lost touch for like 10 years and reconnected on Instagram in December this year.

I added her and she instantly messaged me saying she was looking for me. We clicked off right off the bat and started talking daily. I've helped her through a break up, we were getting really close, talking everyday and, I kid you not, all day. As we got closer, we've started chatting about intimate stuff, like what do we like in bed, teasing each other, like if I said I like nice hands, 10 sec later I see a video of her showing me her manicure. She's seen me without a shirt and said I look ""amazing, hot"" and I have a very sexy morning voice.

This whole time we were assuring each other we're not looking for relationships. She even said she's kind of disgusted by men now and thanked me for not being pushy at all. Honestly I was sure I do not want to date her or anyone else, but the idea of having someone near me, who I know is attracted to me and vice versa, was very cook. In hindsight, I should have known how this is going to turn out.

We've met twice. I instantly liked the real her. She said she likes my wit and such. Then we went to a concert, pushing through the crowd holding hands not to lose each other. 

After a while, at some point she's asked me if I think about her sexually. I admitted, yup. Asked the same, she also confirmed, but then her being kind of flirty and warm towards me died. Like in a moment, there was nothing.

So I asked what was going on, we've had a rather unpleasant exchange, where she nearly screamed that it was not what I thought, she has no real attraction towards me and it was all just teasing, jokes, and that saying someone looks great and has nice hair, and saying they are objectively attractive is very different from actually being attracted to them. I asked about the sexual stuff, she said it died within her when she felt it was getting too serious.

Then it all went downhill. Even though she did not want to meet anyone, she agreed to meet someone for coffee and they have kissed. I don't know the details and I am not asking about it. I let her know, and admitted this to myself, that I cannot cope with losing this part of what was going on between us and that I have some feelings for her. I wanted out.

Now she is messaging me daily, sending memes, asking how I am, acting like all of this did not happen. I don't know what to do. I know I fucked up by not realising my feelings earlier and assuring her, as she did assure me, that we're all good. But otherwise, I really don't know where to go from here.",1,1730712758.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1gjaeip,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gjaeip/eating_habit_questions/,Eating Habit Questions,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been very unhappy with my appearance for a while and I‚Äôm trying to make a change for the better. I‚Äôm currently adjusting my eating habits and I want to know what could help me move further. To start off, as a kid I had a texture problem with food which has followed me into my adult life. I can love the taste of something but the texture can cause me to gag a lot, like bananas I eat almost daily for the past 2 years still has that effect and I love the flavour. Because of that I don‚Äôt have a great relationship with many fruits/veggies, but I also don‚Äôt have normal bad eating habits most people would have. For example, it‚Äôs a rarity I eat sugary things/snacks. I also don‚Äôt drink much alcohol, coffee, tea, energy drinks, juice, etc. I normally eat rice, meats, hummus, pita, eggs, cheeses/dairy products, couple fruit and veggies. My vice however, is Pepsi! I can drink 4+ cans a day and if it‚Äôs in front of me I will only choose it. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I‚Äôve drank it so much through my life and do it so much daily that every can I have tastes flat and I no longer enjoy it. That + low self confidence made me really want to make this change. I‚Äôve been soda free for a week now and have been drinking so much water and going to the gym (I also take whey protein), and I‚Äôm on a calorie deficit I have been under. The question I have for people who know more about this than me is‚Ä¶
1. How long till I start to see the results of replacing soda with water? How long will it realistically take to start shedding pounds?
2. What improvements can I make in my diet to ensure I‚Äôm building muscle/replacing the fat. (I‚Äôm buying all kinds of veggies to try, I‚Äôm doing well with greens like spinach, pees, kale, beans, etc. fruit not so much because I hate wet textures). 
3. If I accidentally go over my calorie deficit will that screw the entire week of progress? 
4. If I‚Äôm drinking, what is your go to alcohol which does the least amount of damage when you‚Äôre on a calorie deficit? ",1,1730712747.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

We live in different cities and I never go to his city. Until I was scheduled for surgery‚Ä¶ in his city. Since it‚Äôs a needed surgery where I‚Äôm not allowed to wear makeup I decided to not give a crap about how I look because who cares? Also what are the odds that I‚Äôll run into him? He never takes public transport and my walking distance between buss and hospital is like 300m. Also why would he walk past the hospital and in the middle of the day where he should be at work?

Well so I thought. Who do you think I saw prancing past me? I‚Äôm pretty sure he didn‚Äôt see me but I saw him. He looked energetic and happy. Very handsome as always but a bit lost in his own world. 

I panicked for about 10 minutes. It‚Äôs pathetic. It was a short relationship. He promised the world and I fell for it but I ended up being just a rebound/ someone he used to make his ex jealous enough to want to date him again. And for all I know. That‚Äôs what happened. For all I know - they are now together and there‚Äôs not a single thought in his beautiful yet dumb head about me or how he hurt me. I feel stupid. Part of me wondered what would have happened had he seen me. Would he have talked to me? Would we be back in touch? Take a cup of coffee together and talk about how our almost 1 year apart has been?

She lives in another country but we all met, in real life, through some mutual friends 2 months ago.

I don't have any reasons to suspect anything happening, he never betrayed me, yet I do feel that I am very uncomfortable with him having woman friends and I always kind of opposed this idea.

Now we finally had a talk about this recent friend, I told him I am jealous, I asked if he would cut all contact with her if I asked that, and he said no. And this breaks me, why is he choosing her over me after +10 years of relationship?

We had some even more tswrious talks about this and he sees nothing wrong with the idea of having a close female friend, he even mentioned he would think it's normal to: 

1) go out on a walk or coffee with her alone
2) go on a one day hiking trip with her
3) visit her in another country 

Basically he says that he thinks it's normal to be allowed to do almost anything that he would do with a male friend. But I don't think that's okay and that society sees things similarly. 

And even if I am wrong, why would he choose to make me feel i respected and humiliated by doing something that would hurt me so much?

Anyways

Going to do some video editing on Final Cut Pro. Mostly vlogs and showcases with some decent amount of plug ins. Though, I‚Äôm torn by the lack of active cooling in the MacBook Air and afraid if the machine throttles unexpectedly just because there‚Äôs no active cooling involved. I know it would handle the load, but what about 7 hours of consistent hard work on Final Cut Pro? It uses ambient air to cool, but damn what if I have the fan/AC off while working on my couch (no direct laptop > couch contact.)?
Also wanted to add, I‚Äôm not too worried of downgrading size.. I think I would like the portability especially when working on the couch or taking it to the coffee shop. I use prescription glasses anyway when working, so seeing smaller words isn‚Äôt an issue.

After several years through my college life I became a connoisseur, imbibing thousands of cups of coffee, different kinds of roasts from all known regions,   Four years later, after finishing my studies and unexpectingly landing a job at a fortune 500 tech firm (well before the term FAANG ever existed), what started as killing a few hours playing with the espresso machine in our office rec room while waiting for builds, turned into a hobby. I just got better and better and was receiving compliments from my coworkers on my handiwork. 
The kind of encouragement that influences your path in life, like the time my art teacher told me I could give Chuck Close a run for the money if he were still alive, which lead me to take more art classes and ultimately becoming an artist.  

Anyway, long story short, I became my own private coffee roaster, barista, and coffee expert. My kitchen turned into a bonafide coffee bar, fit for the most hard-core tattoo-cladded USBC-inspired barbell moustash sporting baristas and their manpurse-sporting hipster clientele. 

But much has changed in my life since then. But one thing that hasn't is the coffee. Coffee is still just coffee. But it's always my coffee, and usually very good. ",11,1730712317.0,espresso,4,0.82,False

Incident 11/3 (note: multiple bites, but did not break skin)
Foster noted he was anxious and vocal, tried to escape when crated. In the foster's apartment, he solicited attention and rolled over for belly rubs, but also would playfully bite at the foster's arms and hands. A few hours after getting them home, decided to go on a walk around the neighborhood. A ways into the walk, he rolled over for belly rubs, got tangled up in the leash, and bit and latched onto the leash. The foster tried pulling it away, and that made it into a game and he pulled back. The foster was eventually able to get him to let go and they started walking home. A few minutes later, Carl chewed through the leash. The foster grabbed him to prevent him from running off, and he redirected towards her and started jumping and biting her arms. She got ahold of the collar, but that only made his biting worse. She then let go and walked/ran away, and he followed. She then got a a coffee shop, where he came up to her and she was able to grab his collar again. From there, we was relaxed until an ASO was able to arrive.

Grew up in an emotionally abusive household. A lot of the pain was from seeing my father torment my mum. Everything she said was wrong to him. She wasn‚Äôt allowed any friends. Couldn‚Äôt decide what to watch on TV. Wasn‚Äôt allowed to go on holidays.

I missed out on a childhood due to all this. My mum is the loveliest person in the world but she didn‚Äôt make the situation easier for me. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go to friends houses because my mum would ask me not to leave her there with him. Every time he shouted at us, she would ask me to go cheer him up and get him in a ‚Äògood mood‚Äô. I quickly learnt it was my job to manage everyone else‚Äôs emotions.

I left at 18 for uni and have had a somewhat normal life since then (with lots of therapy). 

I‚Äôm now nearly 30 and my mum has become very unwell in recent years. She‚Äôs been hospitalised a lot recently and I worry she doesn‚Äôt have more than a year or so left. She requires full time care which my dad is doing. I assumed that in his old age he is nicer to her. 

I‚Äôve stayed at their house for the last couple months to help out and spend time with her. My mum has a lung condition and they‚Äôve said even a cold would be really bad for her to get, so I‚Äôve had to really limit social interaction to avoid picking anything up and giving it to her. This means so much time around my father.

The comments are constant. I offered him a coffee the other day and he said he hopes I get cancer and that my future children get cancer. Constantly tells me he wishes he didn‚Äôt have kids. Everyone is awful in his mind. My mum‚Äôs friend came round to check on her and after she left he went on a rampage about how she‚Äôs a whore (she‚Äôs lovely). 

I had a really important work call and made both my parents aware of it. He came into my room really loudly talking in the middle of it. I think it‚Äôs a control thing.

Everything I do is wrong. I go for a run. ‚ÄòWho do you think you are running, you‚Äôll never be an athlete, everyone is just laughing at you out there.‚Äô

My boyfriend and I (relationship of 3 years) broke up a month ago and I haven‚Äôt even mentioned it to either of my parents because I don‚Äôt want to upset my mum and my dad will somehow use it against me and make me feel worse.

He‚Äôs just so mean to my mum. She was breathless with her condition the other day and needed some more oxygen and he kept calling her the ‚Äòdevil‚Äôs child‚Äô. She can‚Äôt do the stairs anymore and slept on the sofa for a while because he thought a bed downstairs would ‚Äòlook disgusting‚Äô. 

I mentally don‚Äôt think I can stay here for much longer but I want to look after my mum and spend the time with her that I can.

However it being insurance and call centre, the calls can be pretty full on and we're managed on our productivity so basically I have be constantly 'inbound' ready to take calls. 
I know there is some leeway to this target but you know what it's like with adhd, I'd rather be over vigilant then think I can take a break all the time and get away with it (cause I never can) 

It does come with some responsibility, if I get things wrong people's insurance can fuck up but it is system led so it's pretty hard to get it THAT wrong but I think I'm just getting really sick of being on phones, being so customer led and maybe having a job with this must responsibility, especially now I have a baby to look after also but I know there's a certain kind of boring job that will drive adhd brain absolutely mental and ones that will probably just happily keep us ticking over. 

I know being 16 hour probably limits me to just retail but I think I really want a job just in a coffee shop or clothes shop, just kind of doing bare minimum so I can save my energy for my baby, but I have no idea and I don't want to jump out of an alright job into a hell hole. 
I know I DON'T want to work in a supermarket, literal sensory nightmare but just wanted advice what's the least responsible job that stratches our adhd brains enough to not want to die when I go to work. I'm just really not looking forward to going to work at atm. ",1,1730709360.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

\-What are your Interests?

\-Extrovert of Hermit Crab?

\-What do you do for fun?

\-What app you use the most?

\-How many real friends you have? Not those people you just know but have good understanding and enjoy being around them with.

\-How is your mental health?

\-What you wanna do after getting out of college? or what are you doing after college?

\-How often do you go out with friends or go out just in general for a walk or fresh air?

\-Single or Dating........ or married?

\-""Whatever happens, happens"" or Anxious about future?

I'm asking these questions because I grew up very weird. I lived in an area rather mediocre society as a middleclass family where the norm was hanging out with friends on the street, play cricket, roam the streets, punjabi, chapri lifestyle. You get the image. But instead I was given a PC and UNRESTRICTED INTERNET at a very young age. Because I grew up watching Foreign stuff (Movies and Shows) I never had problem with understanding English, and because of that, I never watched Carymenati/Ducky bhai instead I was more of Dantdm/Markiplier kid. Furthering Increasing the constrast between me and an avg pk kid. Fast forward to 15y/o in pgc. I was the weird kid in the class. No friends because off the charts interests. If any word left their mouth, it was always about sex and girls. Swearing 12 times in a 5 word sentence, Borderline MMA fighting ""jokingly"". I was having none of that. So I chose to stay a loner instead.

I don't regret my choices. I'm glad I chose to be alone than to become like those. But man have I missed out alot. I don't remember my college days. Nothing from academy either. Before I know it, I'm 17, doing a 9-5 office job, while doing exams. I'm skipping an year before uni for some reasons.   
My whole personality is the internet culture and some online indonesian ""friends"" I made online.   
So through these questions, I wanted to know what the teenagers today are like so that maybe I can make some friends before my life gets even busier.

And let me answer the questions above myself as well.

  
\-Drawing, Mangas, Anime, Internet Drama, Movies, Cars, Memes, Philosophy, Gaming, Books (started recently tho, only read No longer Human by Osamu Dazai so far.)

\-Hermit Crab (introvert)

\-Read mangas and some yt videos. 

\-Yt

\-Take a guess. Hint, it ranges from -1 to 0.

\-Pretty alright, I'm pretty optimistic. Thanks Marcus and Neitzche.

\-Realistically, just get into a uni and get me a CS Degree. Unrealistically, Study Photography, Cinematography and Philosophy. Oh and be an artist too.

\-Sit in the park for like 30, 45 minutes whenever I feel like every day.

\-.....yeaah.

Just to recap the people involved (fake names):

1) Amy is the pregnant one, and she has always been the centre of the group (to clarify: I don't mean this in a negative way, she's very nice and just the kind of person other people are naturally drawn to)
2) Cathy is particulary close to Amy. She wants children at some point.
3) Michelle wants to start having children soon-ish.
4) Jessie is married and had a kid last year. She wants more in the future. I don't really get along with her anymore, more on that below.
5) Me - childfree

-> This is basically the OG friend group. We've know each other for 20+ years.

Then there are also Leah and Nadine, who sometimes participate when we do stuff, but not super regularly.

Now to the update:

When Amy announced her pregnancy to us, Cathy, Nadine and another person (not part of our group) were travelling together. Because Amy didn't want anyone to feel left out, she decided to tell us during brunch and immediately text the others, so everybody would hear the news at the same time. Nadine quickly responded and congratulated her, but Cathy didn't. Cathy apparently didn't reply for several days, and then just with ""congrats"". After that, she wasn't available to talk or text with Amy due to ""no wifi and poor connection"" at her destination. Meanwhile Nadine was sending photos and little updates...

Cathy and Nadine eventually return, but Cathy still doesn't reach out to Amy. This is crazy, because before all this, they would phone twice a week and meet up (just the two of them) when Cathy was off. Weeks pass and Amy texted her a few times, but only received very short replies. Cathy kept saying she was super busy with work, which is def. true, but she was always able to make time in the past, sooo... At some point, Nadine tells Amy that Cathy had mentioned during the trip how disappointed she was that Amy hadn't told her about the pregnany BEFORE everyone else. That she as her best-best friend was entitled to be the first (out of the group) to know.

Amy obviously didn't agree (understandable) and didn't reach out to Cathy anymore. She was now pissed because she felt Cathy was being selfish (which I agree with tbh, nobody is entitled to any information). She even decided not to ask Cathy to be the godmother anymore... Amy just texted her ""let me know if you want to meet up"" and Cathy texted back ""yeah, we need to talk"".

Several MONTHS go by and Cathy finally agrees to meet Amy. She then tells her everything, confirming that she was disappointed etc. I obviously don't know the details of this conversation, just the bits that Amy told me. They ""resolved"" their fight, but it's a cold war at this point. They don't phone or meet up anymore. We all met up this weekend at A's place and it was super awkward. They barely spoke to each other. When Amy asked Cathy a medical question (she's a pediatrician), she barely looked at Amy when answering.

Jessie on the other hand is now suuper invested in the friendship with A. Which is a load of bs, because the moment she met her now-husband, she pretty much dipped out of the group. She used to be the one who always wanted to go out, do things, meet up for coffee etc. But then he came along and poof she vanished. Then they got married and had the baby and she vanished for good (like we only saw her once a year). This is why I don't really like her anymore. We were just a means to an end. But now that Amy is pregnant, she's soo happy she'll have a mommy-friend üôÑ She's constantly texting her, giving her advice (that Amy mostly doesn't ask for) and now that Amy is reducing her work load to 4 days a week, she immediately said ""oh we can meet for coffee on your day off!"". Before it was just crickets!! Amy is obviously very aware why Jessie is suddenly so interested in their friendship.

The whole dynamic of the group has changed. Amy and Jessie just talk about baby stuff, Michelle is super excited and has baby-fever, Cathy feels left out and is now basically walking out. I'm also distancing myself, because meeting up with them just doesn't bring me joy anymore.

Now Cathy is trying to replace Amy with me -  like she'll text me about her day or phone in the evening, something that we've never really done before (and we were both fine with that dynamic). I don't know how to feel about it.

She told me how she could understand that Amy didn't want to tell her about the pregnancy before anyone else, but what she didn't understand was that Amy hadn't told her AT ALL that she was even thinking about having a baby. A while back, Amy even told us she wanted to quit her job and go travelling long-term, but IF she decided to do that, she would have to break up with her boyfriend, because a LDR wouldn't work and he didn't want to quit his job unless he was guaranteed he could return to it. So that was the status we were aware of, and then bam she changes all her plans and gets pregnant! I kinda understand why Cathy is upset. They were best friends for soo long and Amy didn't tell her anything about her long-term plans, something you'd normally expect your best friend to share with you. Like I get not telling people you're ""actively trying"", but I guess she could've at least told Cathy that they were thinking about having a baby in the next few years or something. But kablam it came out of nowhere. I asked Cathy if she thought the friendship would recover and she said no.

So yeah, that's how an unborn baby (indirectly) ruined our long-running friend group that so many people admired us for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ",27,1730708404.0,childfree,15,0.94,False
1gj9hob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1gj9hob/i_realized_ive_become_a_workaholic/,I realized I've become a workaholic,"I was thinking in my car after I came home from work, and I realized I've become a workaholic. I think there are a few reasons for that. 

The biggest thing that comes to mind is that I had to financially help some relatives this year. Shortly after my birthday in March, they asked for $3500.00, then another month they asked for $1500.00, then $1000.00. In July they asked for $3000.00, but I told them I didn't have it, so I just gave nearly all the savings I had left until I had around $200.00 left. At that point I was starting to get behind on my car lease payments. 

The second big thing that happened is that I haven't been able to afford any new experiences to make friends. I've been able to hang out with friends from work a few times, but not nearly as much as I would like. Twice this year, 4 of us the first time, and 3 of us the next time went to our favorite barcade, and 2 nights ago one of those friends and I went to a pool hall. I enjoyed myself all three times, but I wish I had more money to afford new experiences, like traveling with friends. 

The third thing is that, while I do have activities outside of work, they are mostly isolated. On my off days, I work out at the gym to stay in shape, but I don't attend any classes because I'm anxious about money. Meanwhile, while I do enjoy my job as a security guard, my real dream is to be a comic book artist, which can be very time consuming and isolating. When I'm not working or working out, I draw my own comics at my favorite coffee shop, but I mostly sit by myself. It's quiet there because everyone is working on their own thing, which is peaceful, but also makes it intimidating to approach anyone I find interesting. I used to volunteer a lot in high school as well, yet I haven't been able to find any available charities to work with, mainly because of my work schedule. The same thing happens with church when I go on Saturday evenings; I go by myself, and I have trouble finding the time or money to volunteer or participate in different events there. I used to have a Bible study group I would meet with on Mondays, but I can't see them anymore since they all became busy with work. 

But the worst thing that happened to me this year was when a great aunt I sincerely tried to help backstabbed me in a terrible way. I moved in with her back in August to protect her from her abusive husband, and me and some other relatives went along with her crazy plan to get him into a nursing home without him knowing because we were worried for her safety. That ate up a whole weekend, and afterwards I tried to help my great aunt around her house. However, she then started making absurd demands, like how I need to stay in the house for 5 hours on my days off even though I'm 28, or how I can't enter the house until she gets home to turn the alarm off. 

One night, I was helping her in the backyard with the sprinklers, and even though I was trying to follow her directions, she was getting frustrated, so at one point she said ""Do you understand my english?"" in a very rude and condescending manner. So I asked, ""Why do you talk to me like that?"". When we finished and went back inside, she told me, ""That's how I speak to your great uncle (her husband), if you don't like it, you can go"". Then the next night, she told me she was turning on the house alarm while she went out with some friends, and I said that was fine since I was working late. She said she would be home by 8:50 pm to turn the alarm off, but when I got home at 10 pm and texted her ""I'm home, are you?"", she didn't respond. So I just walked inside, and fortunately the alarm was off so I went to sleep. The next day at work, she texts  me, "" You didn't address me properly, it's time for you to find another place to stay."" I talked it over with 2 other relatives, and they both said it was time for me to move back in with one of them. So one of the relatives explained to my great aunt that I would be coming to grab my stuff and move out after work that day. 

I came back to the house to start getting my things, and when I went inside, the alarm went off. Keep in mind the whole 2 and a half months I stayed with my great aunt, she never gave me the code to turn off the alarm. So when I texted her to ask for the alarm code, she said she couldn't give it to me, then when I said I would just get my stuff and leave, she said ""The police and security are coming, I won't defend you, good luck"". I went to the neighborhood security to explain the situation to them, and they said I had to contact the police to get my things. Anyway, I spoke to my great aunt again after that, and she said I could come back the next morning to get my stuff, so I just went home to my other relative, and slept until the next day. 

The next day, me and 2 more family members went to get my stuff back, and we recorded my great aunt through video, because the two relatives that told me to move out were comparing texts and realized that my great aunt was telling them different things and trying to manipulate them. One of them distracted her while the other one and I got my stuff and left. And of course, as we were getting my things, she called the security on us, at least they were calm and reasonable. The cherry on top is that later on the relative I moved back in with, showed me a text where my great aunt had told her that she had told me the alarm would be on the day I went to get my stuff back, even though she never told me that day. So basically, she set me up to get arrested!! 

That whole crazy experience has left me feeling very used and under appreciated. And now I'm back from where I started at the beginning of this year. I'm still working overtime so I can eventually get my own place, and start selling my comics at the monthly artist convention I go to once a month. However, I feel very burned out and emotionally drained, like a washed up, dirty rag that's about to be thrown away. 

I believe all of this is the source of my workaholism: my job is the one place I feel visible, the one place I feel seen and appreciated, the one place where I feel like my actions matter and my life is important. The day I got Officer of the Month was the happiest I've felt all year. Is this bad? What should I do? I'm haunted by an increasing anxiety of the future, a constant pressure to perform, and a sense of invisibility everywhere but work. More than anything I want someone to tell me that I'm doing a good job, I want someone to make me feel like I matter. I would do anything for that kind of attention.
