1pon1tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1pon1tk/positive_csection_experience/,Positive C-Section Experience,"Hi all! I gave birth 10 days ago and wanted to share my positive c-section experience. I am a FTM and went to induction at 39 weeks due to diet controlled gestational diabetes. I showed up 2 cm dilated and 60% effaced. I had the foley balloon placed (did not hurt but I also opted for Nubain) and it fell out within 2 hours. My water broke on its own at 5 cm and I ended up getting the epidural shortly after. I made it to 7cm before baby was in distress and ended up having to get a c-section. Although it was not what I hoped for, I wanted to give a positive experience on my c-section.

1. I was up 6 hours after birth walking. A lot of people say it feels like your stomach is falling out, that was not the case for me and I really didn’t feel a ton of discomfort. Just move slow and your body will thank you! 

2. I did a lap around the labor and delivery floor every few hours, that 10 minute walked helped me not swell so much. It was amazing to move and again I was in no pain. (The only pain reliever I was on was ibuprofen due to the nausea morphine gives me). 

3. I was able to shower as soon as I could walk and I instantly felt so much better.

4. Getting up and down was not hard, I just took it slow. The toilet was the only place I had my husband help me because it was so low to the ground.

5. I’ve had only a slight burning sensation at the incision site do the first few days, I think it was my bodies way of telling me to slow down.

6. I peed as soon as my cath was out and was able to poop 2 days after. I was pretty gassy up until I pooped, but passing the gas felt AMAZING. 

7. I was in the hospital for 4 days due to a NICU stay for baby boy, but I was driving 5 days after birth. It felt so good to go for a coffee run and feel normal. 

8. I have been able to utilize my walking pad at home, clean the house and today we took our first walk in our subdivision. Moving my body has been incredible and I’m so thankful I had a positive c-section experience. 

9. At my 1 week post op check up my scar is healing beautifully! So far no infection or draining really. You can barely tell I had a c-section. 

I don’t want to discredit anyone who had a terrible experience, I just want to say not all experiences are terrible and I hope I can bring some comfort to those who were terrified (like me) to have a c-section. I was able to listen to music in the OR and it all happened so fast I was truly in awe how quick my baby boy made his arrived. 

Good luck to anyone who is having a c-section, I hope you have a positive experience!!",1,1765944697.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False
1pon1oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1pon1oh/diagnosed_with_proctitis/,Diagnosed with Proctitis,"So two months ago I started having diarrhea like movements with lots of blood (looks like a crime scene) and my initial thought was hemorrhoids. There wasn’t any pain, but all that blood was alarming. Fast forward to two weeks ago and my colonoscopy confirmed ulcerative proctitis. Now I’m on day 13 of my Hydrocortisone enemas. I’ve also been taking four mesalamine pills a night. Hasn’t been much of a difference in my symptoms so I’m starting to get worried. GI just added another 14 days of enemas, but after that I will have to switch to Mesalamine suppositories.

My question is, should I be worried since I’m still seeing a lot of blood? How long did it take for some of you for your symptoms to clear up?

I thought coffee may have cause this, but at most I drank one cup every other day anyway. Regardless I haven’t had any in a while.

It’s nice to finally know what I have, but information on treatment seems to be all over the place. I guess im just looking for peace of mind

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I'm having my bachelorette party in Minneapolis (party of 7), but I am not local to the area. I'd like to get suggestions from people who know the area to tell me what's good in terms of planning. We'll be arriving at our rental on a Wednesday evening (early enough for dinner but something easy, likely due to travel), and checking out to head home on Sunday.

I'm trying to plan for essentially 4 breakfasts, 3 lunches, and 4 dinners.

We're looking for relatively budget-friendly options ($20-30 per entree, not every meal has to be in that range, though, if worth it).

* I would like to know if there's a good **All You Can Eat sushi place** and **a hibachi place**
   * I currently have OkiDoki Sushi and Hibachi Daruma flagged as possible options
* I am on the hunt for **a good Italian restaurant** that offers **bread with olive oil** (for sale or free). I don't know what it is about the combo, but I want it.
   * Ideally, this restaurant would also have **Moscato** and **tiramisu** on its menu.
* Best, most authentic **Mexican places**.
* Great **brunch/breakfast** spots
* The best **coffee shops** (small business preferred)
* Any other **fun, unique places** that you feel are underrated but worth checking out (food or otherwise)!

Sleeps at night without any problems, eats well, is super smart and observant, has a lovely temper and personality and..those hugs..they're the best! 
I just..I don't love being a mom. I mean, of course there's aspects of it that I like but in general I feel like I'm trapped in this cycle of constant work. There's my job outside the home..and then there's being a parent. There's always so much to do and there's literally almost no time to do anything for myself. It's almost like I don't even know who I am anymore. It has stared to take a toll on my mental health. And all of this with a very supportive husband and help from family. I just miss the peace..being able to wake up in the morning, sip on my coffee and do nothing..or do whatever I wanna do. I miss the freedom and spontaneity of kid free life. I also miss my social life. I do see my friends every now and then but..it's not nearly enough and I feel a bit isolated. Not to mention lately it's been being sick constantly because he keeps bringing stuff from daycare. It just...I'm tired and frankly, a bit bored of the same routine. I wanna do more stuff but I feel like we're so limited as to what we can do with him at this age. Especially in winter .I don't know how people do it with multiple kids, I struggle with 1 kid. And he's lovely! And I know I'll enjoy it a lot more as he gets older, but I'm also scared. I feel bad for feeling this way. He was very much planned. I was never crazy about having kids but with my husband I said, ok..one should be ok. There's just a good part of me that's always missing my old life and sometimes I even get resentful. It's awful I know, but I'm not sure how to change this. I guess there's some people who feel so fulfilled by being parents but..that's not really the case for me. People always says..it's the best thing. And yes, there's a lot of good. And the love I have for my son, it's unlike anything I've experienced before. Yet I still don't necessarily enjoy motherhood.

1pompv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fosterparents/comments/1pompv3/likelihood_of_imminent_death_upon_return_to/,Likelihood of imminent death upon return to bio-parent,"Not going to apologize for my crashout. 

I lost my privacy for the sake of my life, and that’s why I am a foster parent now… even though I was absolutely failed by the system(as in they answered the call but would never did a check) and that kid I crashed out over is being failed by the system too. 

The moderator and some people have the idea that privacy outweighs the right to live. You don’t have privacy when you’re dead, and since that is a contrary viewpoint, I’ll be leaving this group after my story as I see life as more valuable than privacy and life worth protecting even if it comes to violating the right to privacy. 

CPS/DSS wouldn’t even show up for me, despite my calls and the evidence all over my body of the abuse I endured as a child. My mother burnt my hands at 3 years old because my older brother broke the glass on the wood stove… 35 years later, the only time I feel pain on the front of my hand is when something is hot enough to blister it. My back is covered in burn scars from where my mother would get pissed and throw her microwaved coffee at me, mug and all. I have 2 scars on my chest from my mother being a left handed idiot and stabbing me (idiot being that she stabbed me on the right side and they hit the bone). I was constantly threatened and abused, I had known the phrase, “I wish I would have aborted you,” well before I could understand what an abortion was. 

My mother only had one protection/restraining order against her, by our mail lady, and only an arrest for drug possession. My dad never called the police on her for the domestic violence and flying knives. He felt like he would be arrested… also the reason he never left is because he felt he wouldn’t get custody. 

It escalated as I got older.  I was so scared, I only left my room the summer the year I was 12 when my dad was back home so I would avoid my mother and developed paranoid eating habits and I would only eat sealed packaged foods because her constant death threats and the rat poison that was in the house. 

I was passed around my church and my dad’s trusted work friends because CPS wouldn’t get involved and there was the threat of imminent death at home. During one of the short periods I lived at home when I was in high school, my mother pulled the shotgun on me and threatened me. I told her to do it, because I was tired of all the bullshit, I was ready to die. Guess what… my dad had to remove me from the home again, because no one would get involved. My mother later broke her back and had to have rods in her back, I had to return home to care for her, my older sister and her 2 kids… even then, it STILL wasn’t safe for me to be alone with her. 

Great thing is she’s dead, so even though no one would report it, and no one would respond to the report anyways… so all of you can stay inactive.

The kid I crashed over had 2 parents both have more of a criminal history and a record of threats of violence so deep that CPS, CASA and the judge recused themselves and some/most/all of them have protection/restraining orders against the parents. Both parents… that kid doesn’t have a parent to keep them as safe as possible from the other one like I did. This group takes the value of privacy over the value of life, so I hope the foster family who has that kid finds a way to keep that kid from death, great if they do it in a way that protects the kid’s privacy, but I would rather hear about this kid being alive and losing his privacy than think about that kid being dead because privacy was more important.

I go to a Japanese salon that charges 60$ for a haircut which reflects the quality I expect. I go back to the same person every time BECAUSE he consistently does a good job and we have a good relationship. Don't hairdressers give good service so that people trust them and come back. 

Like, if you hire a plumber to fix a leak and they do a good job, you would hire them next time theres an issue. If they did a bad job, you just wouldnt hire them again. 

Apart from this, what else do you guys tip?

I tip waiters 10% for normal service and 12%-15% for really great service. Keep in mind this is on top of tax so its technically more. Everywhere else I don't tip (pay at counter places, coffee shops etc).

Many factory jobs were outsourced, Walmarts were built with self checkout, local hamburger, coffee, breakfast, and liquor places got turned into McDonalds, Starbucks, Dennys, and 7-11s, etc. Computers, the internet, and smartphones made many jobs obsolete that i never knew existed. Immigrants took the “physical jobs” i never even considered working. (I quit my construction job)

Essentially the “damage” was already done by the time I started working…. So I didn’t realize how things used to be like.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pomkbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1pomkbl/he_urinated_many_times_a_day/,He urinated many times a day,"For a little over a year now, I've been having some problems that started after a urinary tract infection.

What happened was that in November of last year (2024), I held in my urine for a long time. The next day, I woke up to go to work and started feeling unwell: fever, itching, burning, pain. This was the first time I'd ever had a urinary tract infection. I had a urinalysis, and sure enough, I had an infection. I took the antibiotic prescribed by the doctor for the prescribed number of days, and the symptoms disappeared. A few days later, I masturbated, and that's when it all started. I began to feel a slight burning sensation and a constant, urgent need to urinate after ejaculating. I went to the doctor, and they ran tests, analyses, ultrasounds, etc. I was given treatments that didn't work, like taking antibiotics, tolterodine, and tamsulosin for months, as if it were prostatitis, but nothing helped. I got circumcised a couple of months ago, mostly as a precaution. I've been gradually improving; I went from urinating every 15-30 minutes to now urinating every 4 hours (within the normal range). The problem is that sometimes I don't know what happens, and I urinate every 1 or 2 hours (each urination is large, I'd say about 200 ml or more, and the stream is also strong). Also, after ejaculating, I always feel a lot of sensitivity, as well as a constant urge to urinate and sometimes a slight burning sensation, but it doesn't hurt. I usually drink water, sometimes milk, and occasionally fruit juice. I don't drink alcohol, coffee, or soda, but when I do, my symptoms worsen for a few days. I also quit smoking tobacco for the same problem. I've been smoke-free for a little over two months now, going from up to five cigarettes a day to none.

I'd say my symptoms are: sensitivity after ejaculation, frequent urination (sometimes urgent), sometimes accompanied by a slight burning sensation.


I think I have a problem with my bladder and/or urethra, or probably some pelvic floor dysfunction, but I've had several tests done, and I no longer have any infections. The ultrasound of my kidneys and urinary tract came back normal. I don't have diabetes or similar problems like high blood pressure, hypertension, etc. The only thing left is to go to physical therapy, but before that, I'd like to know if anyone has experienced something similar. I read that many people experience pain in a certain area when they have a pelvic floor problem, struggle to urinate or defecate, have difficulty passing gas, among other things, but I don't have any of those problems. I urinate and defecate normally, I pass gas normally, I can control the urge to poop and urinate, as well as hold in gas, and I don't have any pain anywhere. I've read that sometimes a foot pain can cause a pelvic floor problem. I sprained my knee two years ago and had plantar fasciitis in my right foot a year ago, but I walk fine. I'm 28 years old, and I'm also overweight. I've been working on it; I had lost 20 kg, but this problem caused me to gain it back, as it causes me a lot of anxiety and stress. I'm a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of time sitting, I'd say about 10 hours a day, sometimes in awkward positions. I'm currently going to the gym and trying to eat better, like I used to. My last appointment with the urologist was about two months ago. I was discharged after my circumcision and decided not to go back and see what happened, since maybe my problem is more mental or psychological than physical. I don't know.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I value emotional presence, respect, and meaningful conversations over small talk. If you’re also looking for a sincere, low-pressure friendship, I’d really love to connect.

I did not like my teacher. I felt like I didnt get enough 1 on 1 time in a group of 5 vs the other teacher who takes on 2 students. 

My hopes were high, but then again this was my THIRD time working for petsmart in the last 10 years.

I had not slept the night before. I was running on 2 coffees and a coke. I gotten there half an hour early because thats the time we were coming in the week prior. I was already in a bad mood. 
And yes: I am bipolar. But have never been angry or mad with a dog. I draw the line there.

She's a busy body. She's in charge of all of the states grooming academy/assessments and salons. 
And shes always in and out taking calls doing this or meetings. Taking away from her students.
My coworker and I checked in our first dogs and I didnt reconmend a package upgrade God forbid. 
Mostly because my coworkers dog was dog reactive and the other pet parent needed to leave. 
So I was rushed. 

BuT tHaTs No ExCuSe.

Mind you I havr been burnt out being a dog bather and have been having issues with my home store. The PLAN was to graduate: move stores ""temporary"" because my homestretch isn't have hours, another coworker just got back from academy [ironically from the teacher with 2 students!] And had no labor hours. But my manager said I could transfer IF I wanted to. That was my last scrap of hope.

My teacher asked me what the importance of the add on packages were and looks right at me and I bluntly said, tired, and almost on auto pilot sarcasm. 

""to make the company more money.""
""No.""

For the better of the pets. Thats the answer she WANTED to hear.

But am i wrong? 

These 20 somethings in my group had to learn this isnt a job promotion. You'll still be making minimum wage when you go home. 
You'll have to bust your ass and bleed for the company to MAYBE commission out.

But she was tired of my shit, the prior spat I had a week before and brought me into the office.
She said i wasn't allowed to blame my ""incompetent managers.""

I wasn't having any of it and when the manager started talking I just said ""so get to the point and just tell me if I'm leaving the program.""
And she kept yelling at me ""YOU ARE BEING INSUBORDINATE 
INSUBORDINATE 
You'll return to your store for your schedule. Then we can talk about academy.""
But guess what? No labor hours!!!
and I wasn't even mad. I was done. I was done months ago.
""Okay well I want ___ to be my teacher then because I'll get more 1 on 1."" Was the absolute slap to the face to my teacher. 

So the manager told me no, YoU dOnT gEt To ChOoSe WhO tEaChEs YoU. She does. 

Even though: my coworker who got 1 on 1 did!

She told me to get my stuff and clock out. 

So I tossed all the shit from the kit in my bag, ripped up my graduation hat and left it on the floor of the empty Banfield for them to clean up and stole a monster from the clock in room. 

Texted the group me I put my 2 weeks in. My manager calls me and says we have no hours in the salon but you can do frieght.  

I absolutely hate the manager who does truck and I'm pretty sure hes homophobic. 

Texted my teacher:
Sorry I failed you as a student and wasted your time. 
Sorry MY store failed you.
I put my 2 weeks in. They have no hours in the salon so there's no point going back to ""incompetent managers.""


As soon as I sent my 2 weeks over group me, the comment was deleted and I was removed from the group. 

Yeah, for the pets but what about the mental health of your students and employees?

Am I keeping the kit? Absolutely

Could I have handled it differently, yeah. Did I make my teacher reconsider her teaching methods? Oh probably.

But I have a job interview Friday, and I'm looking into counseling.

Although we’ve traveled quite a bit, this is a region we’ve never experienced before. 

We’re flying into San José very early (\~4am), picking up a rental car (just a 4×2), and planning a round-trip loop from SJO. We definitely want to see the must-see highlights, but we’re equally interested in authentic, local life, smaller towns, less touristy areas, local food, nature, and everyday Costa Rica rather than resort-style travel.

Planning is a bit overwhelming (especially with drive times and not having a 4×4). It’s hard to know what makes sense for a 15-day loop with chill days in between.

Here are the questions that have been hovering over my head: 

1. What would be a solid loop? Where should we head out from San Jose? How many days would be enough for each place? What’s best booked in advance vs last-minute? 
2. Is 4×2 okay? Are there any specific road sections we should avoid without 4×4?
3. Since we arrive early, should we stay in SJO for a quick morning nap + walk around the city, or head straight into the countryside / Arenal area?
4. Any smaller towns, local soda restaurants, small hikes, authentic beaches, farms, coffee estates, markets, etc. that aren’t on every “top 10” list?
5. Are there specific scams or tourist traps people encounter often? Any drives/areas that feel unsafe at night? 
6. What should we absolutely lock in before arriving (park entrances, certain tours), and what’s fine to decide on the fly once we’re on the ground?
7. Anything else that I forgot to think about?

We’re not looking to cram everything in. We’d rather truly experience fewer places than rush through many. Any suggestions, sample routes, or lessons learned would be hugely appreciated.",2,1765942977.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,0.75,False
1pomh10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1pomh10/how_do_i_recover_after_sexual_trauma/,How do I recover after sexual trauma?,"Sexual trauma after first experience how do I recover?

30 year old male year at the start of last year, I met a woman who was a year or two younger than me through a Meetup app. Over a few months (not a one-day thing), we went to the cinema, for drinks, dinner, and eventually back to my place — the whole progression.

During one of those times, literally right before we ended up in bed together, we were talking and I said that I don’t do casual. When we reached the sheets, I had performance anxiety and struggled — it wasn’t ideal. We had dinner afterward, I dropped her home, and the next day I asked her properly if I could take her out for coffee so we could get to know each other more.

She said she wanted to continue as friends.

After that, there was no real conversation — just blame being shifted onto me and what felt like gaslighting. To this day, I don’t fully understand and never got proper conversation even though I had asked multiple times to sit and talk to me. 

To sum it up, that event broke something in my brain. I felt that when I said “I don’t do casual,” that was a boundary, and that was boundary was violatation because her intentions weren’t made clear before we slept together.

It was also my first sexual experience, and not the experience I wanted.

After that event, I went through CBT and EMDR trauma therapy was put on SSRI’s , ended up in a ward but fast forward to end of year now sex itself is no longer neutral for me. Since that moment,  my body count has reached high 20’s with sex itself being a mechanical act and me feeling as a robot

Any connection that ends up in bed is over. No coffees, no follow-ups. Connections don’t last. I will not even reply I just don’t care I know it’s wrong but I choose in full conscious to do it 

For me, sex is now filled with spite and negative emotion. Not toward myself but once we’re in bed, I see myself as a machine and the other person as just a Peice of meat. There’s no connection anymore.

As mentioned before I’ve done CBT, EMDR trauma therapy heavy drinking, drugs which all got me functional again etc and solved a part of problem this event has created but not solved everything 

I’m not at peace with myself. I feel a deep sense of disgust toward sex itself, and even toward the word friend and any friendship with anybody male/female . But I’m more social now  than I’ve ever been in my life , If I weren’t writing this you would not know anything is wrong with me and maybe any women only catch this side after hitting the sheets . but honestly I don’t see people as potential connections anymore — I see them as a means to an end.

How do I make both of these things — sex and the word friend or friendships — feel neutral again?

1pomgn4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pomgn4,Upgraded Jade Terra: 7800X3D/NH-L12S and 5070 Ti Gaming SFFPC,"Two years ago, with the substantial help of this sub, I built a Terra 7800X3D/4070 gaming PC that has served me well. Link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/181g0ez/yet\_another\_jade\_terra\_7800x3dnhl12s\_and\_4070/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/181g0ez/yet_another_jade_terra_7800x3dnhl12s_and_4070/)

However, since the 5070 Ti represents a roughly 50% improvement in graphics performance, one of my kids was interested in buying the 4070 from me, and the 5070 Ti came down to MSRP... upgrade time.

I went with the ASUS Prime 5070 Ti and had a custom cable made by DreamBig by Ray, which fit really well. The ""Coffee"" silicone wires worked well with my Noctua theme the original PSlates Customs cables had. I used the 90 degree connector, but did had to cut off a tab to keep it from interfering with with the ASUS Prime heatsink. One snip and no big deal.

Below is the old build with new components:

7800X3D: Excellent gaming performance and low power draw

NH-L12S: Barely fits the B650E-I, set to intake

Corsair SF750 (old): Build’s wattage of \~500W sits in this PSU sweet spot, PSU fan barely turns

ASUS B650E-I: Had all the features I was looking for

G.Skill Ripsaw S5 DDR5 6000: Intel, not AMD version, but does work at 6000

Samsung 990PRO 2TB: Seems fast :-)

ASUS Prime 5070 Ti - 3 fan cooler, runs quietly, fits Terra, no RGB

Fractal Design Terra Jade: Beautiful and good to build in

Custom cables from PSlate: Really helped with excess cable length

Custom GPU cable from DreamBig by Ray

NF-A12x15: Case fan under PSU, set to exhaust

NA-FG1-12: Grill for 120mm fan

I have the case spine set to about “2.5” and there is 5 mm of clearance between the side panel  GPU cooler. I have the NH-12S CPU cooler touching the side panel to give as much room to the GPU cooler fan to panel spacing as possible. I have no unpleasant sounds with this combination. 

The build went smoothly, this case is stoutly built. I assembled all the critical items outside the case and powered them on first, then stuffed into the case. Thought I don’t have a drive of this type, I did route a SATA cable in with the rest of the cables. I offset the PSU by 10 mm to provide a cooling channel.

The NH-12S perfectly fits the B650E-I but when the combination is installed, the only airflow direction that isn’t seriously choked off is down. So I set up the case as intakes on the sides and exhaust down. My earlier build had a 90 mm case exhaust fan mounted with some custom brackets above the PSU/GPU area, but I removed it for this iteration. The system is running fine as it is.

The 7800X3D pulls at most 87W that I’ve seen, though I have an all core undervolt of -25 in the AMD PBO section of the BIOS with ""motherboard limits"" applied. My undervolting guide is linked below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/18f68b4/simple\_precision\_boost\_overdrive\_undervolting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/18f68b4/simple_precision_boost_overdrive_undervolting/)

I have further tweaked the BIOS with a 102 BCLK, the iGPU disabled, and memory running at 6120 with one of the tweaked settings. (I'll try and find some time to document this stuff like my PBO guide). 

I did have a pretty aggressive undervolt running on the 5070 Ti that worked great for benchmarks but crashed Doom: The Dark Ages reliably, so right now I'm just running the GPU with stock settings.

Temperatures while gaming are fine, mid 60's for both the GPU and CPU. The fans aren't working hard at all and the SF750 (old) fan only slowly turns when it turns at all.

1pomeob,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pomeob/my_wifes_inability_to_handle_her_periods_is/,My wife’s inability to handle her periods is driving me nuts.,"As a guy, I haven’t had a period. So admittedly I can’t fully grasp how periods affect her mind and emotions. 

But come on. 

Every single month she spends a week being awful to me. She’ll consistently chew me out for everything, and apparently there’s no right way to do anything.  And it’s never anyone else, it’s always just me she treats like that. 

Here’s an example: I’ll make her hot coffee, and she’ll say “I don’t like coffee hot, you don’t know anything about me. You don’t know me because you don’t care about me.” But she DOES like hot coffee, and always has. Anyway, the next day I’ll make cold coffee and she’ll say “why would I want cold coffee in the morning? It’s like you do things but don’t actually think of what I want.”

Eventually it’ll turn into her saying, “I just think I’d be happier with someone who actually values me.”  Every month, my wife hints that she wants to divorce. 

The other weeks of the month she’s awesome. Love her so much, and she loves me so much. She’ll apologize, say it was her period and didn’t mean it. But if I ever try to point it out during the yelling she’ll get SUPER mad. 

Anyway, I obviously don’t know what it’s like to have a period, but I would assume after 20ish years of it she’d be able to at least notice when the period is talking and not her. 

Anyway, I’m not divorcing her, but this has really had effects on me because 3/4 of the month I’m affected by it.  One week leading up to the period, I’m dreading it. During the period, I’m just constantly getting berated. One week after I’m “getting over” it.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pomba5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/1pomba5/my_big_fat_series_arching_theory/,"My big, fat, series arching theory","So, this is gonna be long. I think Jim has been leaving some serious clues through the series on who makes up the Black Council. 

First off, what’s the Black Council? Okay, so for this theory the Black Council is the same group that seems to call themselves The Circle and I theorize they, for some reason, are mortals or semi-mortals on the side of the Outsiders. 

So, who is on the BC? Well there’s some obvious candidates like Cowl, Peabody, Justin. Lord Raith was chummy with He Who Walks Behind and someone had to make the introductions between Vito Malvora and Cowl so I think he is as well. 

And I think they’ve been quietly trying to recruit for a long time. Way before the series started. Madeline was supposed to be a way into the White Court of Vampires after Lord Raith was neutralized. The Leanansidhe was supposed, and kind of was, to be a way into the Winter Court of Faerie. And Margaret LeFay was supposed to be a way into the White Council of Wizards.

Margaret was supposed to be very much her father’s daughter and her son’s mother: Willful and stubborn. So it almost seems out of character for her to fall under the influence of a White Court vampire like Lord Raith. But what if she was infected by the exact entity that we know changes people’s nature? What if Nemesis got into her?

Here’s how I see it going: Margaret gets deeper and deeper into “gray magic” and shady connections, like Harry or Kumori if you believe her stated intentions. Nemesis sees her potential and Raith is tasked with weakening her mind. Raith alone couldn’t hold her, Nemesis alone couldn’t take her, but both together were too much. She isn’t a slave (Like Cat Sith), or a split personality (Like popsicle-Lea), but a twisted version of herself (Like Maeve).

That’s when she had dinner with Eb, Raith, and Arianna. That might be when she knew Nicodemus and Goodman Grey, they’d both make great recruits for Nemesis. And that’s where she learned that the true purpose of the cabal was to bring forth the Outsiders and begin the Empty Night at the end of the next cycle.

So how’d she get out of it? Thomas. Through the mental bindings and whatever other distractions physical and mental they might have had on her, for one second, she felt true love for her baby Thomas. And Lord Raith’s control shattered, followed quickly by Nemesis’ when she had regained her will.

Then she ran. She was good at it. She’d been dodging Wardens for years through the Ways. But she knew she wouldn’t be keep ahead of them until the next conclusion of the cycle. But the stars would be aligned soon for a new Starborn who could.

I purchased 5 pounds of Ugandan Bugisu Mt. Elgon for $34.00 plus ~$6.00 shipping.

Because I'm a complete noob,  decided to roast several pounds of one coffee for my first roasts instead of the several sample bags I'm getting with the SR800. The idea is to use one variety/lot to get a handle on the basics before hopping onto other beans and  roast styles. Once I get consistent with one bean, I'll move onto others. 

I chose these Ugandans because I was looking for a forgiving or flexible roast. 

My plan is to aim for city+ but if If I over or under roast a bit, they should still be drinkable - even good.

So I have a big favor to ask. I'll be roasting with the extension tube. I would appreciate it if some of you might suggest roasting profiles  for these beans. The linked description has roasting suggestions but they're for drum types. Some directions to get me to city+ and with tips to get lighter and medium dark roasts would be swesome.

Thanks.

Even saw someone get $300+ Shakepaid! This has me curious... How often are people getting Shakepaid? Anyone gotten multiple? 

I've had a Shakepay account since 2021 and have been using Shakepay as my primary card for 8 months now (235 day Shake streak), using it to pay for almost everything. I have my paycheque direct deposited, DCA regularly (using round up, weekly purchases AND autobuy), personally signed up 4 others (whom I have relentless hyped Shakepay to and have converted them to daily users as well). 

For all intensive purposes, I thought I'd be the ideal customer for Shakepay. Someone that uses all the features, doesn't just leech off free sats but provides mutual benefit, and actively promotes Shakepay to anyone that will listen. Despite all this, I've never received a single Shakepaid payment.

Is getting Shakepaid just completely random and not tied to any usage metrics? 

Also... I must add...The latest changes to the incentive structure is deeply disappointing. The incentive structure should be rewarding users like me...but instead, despite everything above, I will not qualify for Blue starting next month which is absolutely crazy lol. I've been one of Shakepay's biggest silent supporters but quite frankly...it's going to be a tough sell moving forward. 

If I can't qualify for Blue tier or even get Shakepaid for a coffee given how much I use my card and endorse this company...then perhaps I (and others like me) are not the primary users Shakepay is trying to target moving forward. What a bummer 😞. I'll have to restructure my spending in the new year to take advantage of much better promotions...from most other cards. 

Regardless, still wish you nothing but the best Shakepay team! Thanks for all you've done. Keep stacking everyone, best wishes to all!

1pom7mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pom7mg/ive_inherited_my_fathers_house_out_in_the/,I've inherited my father's house out in the Southeastern. Something is killing the animals out here. (Part 1),"I’ll try to make this as short as I can but just understand there’s a lot. At the end of November, my father died after falling off the 3rd story roof of his house. It was an accident; he had lost his footing and struck his head right on the edge of the patio. The only sense of comfort was that he died instantly, terrible but instant. My aunt was the one to call me, I had just gotten back to my apartment after a long day of work when she called me. My Aunt Lucy is an emotional woman; I’ve seen her cry and sob more times than I can count. But this, this was pure, anguish. She was scream crying, yelling “He’s dead he’s dead he’s dead!” It took me a few minutes to calm her down enough to tell me that my father was dead. 

Two weeks later was the funeral, which was most of the same thing my aunt began crying 30 seconds into her eulogy. I had to bring her outside and calm her down, I held her for a few minutes, and talked her back down to just a sniffling mess. Like I said before my Aunt is overly emotional, It started when my grandma died when I was 7. I remember she wouldn't leave her house for a whole 4 months after the funeral. She loved everyone in our family more than anyone I know, and it was clear she loved my father the most.

When we went back inside, the service had ended, and everyone was now in the lunch area. Besides me and my aunt, there were 15 other people who had come for the funeral. Mostly old coworkers of my father, nobody I knew, except for Randy. Randy was my fathers neighbor, and the person who found my dad. He walked up to my and my Aunts table, quickly said his condolences, and told us that if we ever needed any help, then just call him. I had met Randy a few times before this, mostly in little parties held by my father at his home. I’ll explain in a moment but yes, I’ve been to the house many, many times before. 

After this was the actual burial, which was just the same as before, Aunt Lucy cried, and I was ready to go home. And I did, at this point I lived in Denver, and I didn’t want to deal with traffic, so while everyone went to my Aunts house for the after party. I just drove back to Denver. But when I got home, just like that November night, I got another call. Once again it was my Aunt, but instead of crying, or asking why I didn’t go to her house. She explained to me that she had just gotten My Dad’s will. Stated at the end of the will was a single sentence, a sentence that would curse me. 

“For Leo, He will receive my home out in the County.”

Fast forward another week, and I now have the keys to the property. And the part where this story starts. Sorry about that exposition piece. I felt it was important to start with for you to understand why I’m here. I loved my dad, and this house was his passion project. I remember when he bought in 7 years ago, I was 19 and going to CSU Fort Collins. So while I never saw the house in its original state, I saw it a few times wherever I came for Chiasmas or thanksgiving. The house is located 3 miles off Highway 50 in Colorado, right between Pueblo and Rocky Ford. The closest piece of civilization was Nepesta, a small-town right off the highway. The land was mostly flat, with fields of grass and dirt as far as the eye can see. Behind the house about 50 yards away was the Arkansas river, which was surrounded by a thin tree line. And out west you can see the Rocky Mountains. From here they were only a faint blue, but you can make out the 3 major ranges of Southern Colorado. Pikes peak, The Spanish/twin peaks, and Greenhorn Mountain. The house itself was beautiful, made up of three sections, the main section being three stories, with a large patio that has a canopy that you could pull out during the winter. The inside had . The other 2 sections were wings of the main area, both two stories. The right wing was a garage, with the second floor being a storage space. While the left wing was an entertainment area, 2 pool tables, a dart board, and a makeshift movie theater. In summary, it was a nice house. 


Now here’s when things get strange, I’ve been staying at the house for about a week now. Mostly maintenance and keeping the place cleaned. I was in the backyard, raking leaves that had fallen from the trees when I smelt something, it was faint, but unmistakable. It was the smell of death, no other way to describe it. Despite how faint it was, I still covered my face with my hand. I followed the smell, leading me about 100 yards East, just at the tree line. There, I found the body of a Coyote, its stomach had been cut open, the entrails of the wild dog had been pulled out of the animals, leaving the animal as a husk. I steered at the carcass for several seconds. Almost gagging but not at the sight, but at the scent. That smell was in full force now, invading my nostrils and taking over every thought. I always heard people describe the smell of rotting corpses as something you’d never forget. Something that even if you’ve never heard of it, you knew what it was. 

I didn’t think about what did this to the Coyote, or why the cut didn’t look like bite marks of any other animal. I wanted the smell gone, now. I went back to the house, grabbing a shovel and mask from the garage. And dug a grave for it, right next to where I found the body. Once done, I gently shoved the body into the pit with the head of the shovel. Doing my best to hold back the eggs and hashbrowns I had eaten that morning from shooting up and adding to the stench. But I got it in and covered it up, patting the ground with the shovel and stared at it. All remaining evidence of the animals was the blood stained grass just 2 feet away. 
I assumed somebody had come onto the property and killed it. But now, and even as I walked away, I knew this was a lie. The cut was too clean, and why not take the body? If it was a poacher, I doubt they’d kill it by cutting its stomach and taking its guts. It all just didn’t sit right with me. 

That night, while in the mini theater watching Warfare. I heard a sharp, painful scream from outside. I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman's scream, but it could make out that it was a painful scream. My first thought was that it was from the movie, but as I stared at the door that led to the backyard, I felt my throat tighten up. Like somebody was grasping my throat tightly, choking me with no intent to let go. It wasn’t until a second scream 15 seconds after the first one that I realized I was holding my breath. I instantly rushed for the door, expecting somebody to be outside maybe 10 feet away from the door. But when I opened it, the screaming suddenly stopped. Now, the only sounds were the Arkansas flowing East, and the movie. It was 8:00 pm, so the sun had already set some time ago. My only light source being the ones from the theater, which illuminated maybe 5 feet around the door. Everything past that was pinch black, with only the silhouette of trees standing out against the slightly cloudy night sky. I stood in the doorway waiting for one more scream. I thought that maybe if it happened again, I’d be able to pinpoint where it was and find the person. But it never came, I waited for 30 seconds but nothing came. So I went back inside and closed the door. sufficiently freaked out, I decided to close the door. So I grabbed the theater remote and turned it off the T.V. 

At that exact moment, I heard something run up to the door, and shortly after

Tap…Tap…Tap…

Something was knocking on the door. My head instantly shot over to the door. My entire body went cold as I imagined what was on the other side. I could feel my heart beating like a war drum, and my breathing stopped once again, forcing me to take deep breaths. This paralysis of fear was only broken after whatever was outside knocked again, the same Tap…Tap…Tap… as before. I slowly walked up to the door, grabbing one of the cue sticks from the rack, hoping I could use it as a weapon against whatever was outside. I’d clear my threat before yelling out as masculine and confident as I could, although it was still obvious that I was scared. 

“Who are you? What do you want?”

There was a moment of silence for a moment before whatever was outside started pounding on the door. It shaked and bulged against its frame, looking like it was about to break. This was when any sense of sensible thought left my mind. I dropped the cue stick, scrambling  out of the wing into the main part of the building. I thought that if I looked behind me, I’d see some monster from a horror movie, my mind conjuring dozens of creatures. These stayed in my mind until I got to the master bedroom. I locked the door, and placed a chair under the door knob. Hoping it could barcode me from whatever it was. I stared at the door for a minute, waiting to hear any footsteps or banging noises from outside. I imagined the werewolf running through my house, tracking my scent. I imagined the creature from the black lagoon walking into my kitchen, its slimy body leaving a trail everywhere it went. These thoughts filled my mind like a river flowing into the ocean. And before I knew it, I ended up watching that door for 15 minutes. I only broke out of my daze because I had gotten a phone call. I didn’t answer it, instead letting it go to voicemail as I got into bed. Even though I wouldn't sleep, I figured I’d at least get comfy. So, I laid there watching the door until by some miracle, I fell asleep. 

I woke up late the next morning, the memory of what happened the day before still fresh in my memory. I walked downstairs and into the left wing. The door that led outside had a large crack in it. The hinges were loose against the drywall. Opening the door, I was immediately met with the same rotting smell as with the coyote. This time it was much, much closer. I gagged, covered my face with my hand. When I looked out, I immediately saw the cause of the smell. Just in front of the tree line laid the corpse of another Coyote. Killed in the same way as the one the day before. Now fresh, the smell of iron rich blood filled my nostrils. Its face stuck in a painful snarl.

That was the final straw, I got into my car and drove to my aunt's house where I’m currently at. It’s been three days since that night, and I don’t plan on going back for another few days. I called the police and explained what happened, they just said it was probably some homeless guy trying to break in. When I asked about the screaming and him banning on my door. They just brushed it off as the guy being on drugs. This wasn’t good enough for me though, I don’t think whatever was outside my house was some druggy. And that's why, I’m going back to the house. It’s stupid but this house meant too much to my dad. And I don’t want to just sell it, so right now I’m just going to do research and buy cameras to put around the property. I’ll update you all in a few days. I hope this is a drug addict, I haven’t gotten any sleep, and I don’t want to steal all my aunts Morning coffee.

- Preferred 5’7” and up (nice to have, not required)

About me:

- Corporate girly (CE, not a contractor)
- Plus size, but working on myself
- Easy to talk to, and better company with coffee ☕😌

Currently r/o (tentative) for Bipolar II, and being treated for (presumably hypo)mania. 

I’ve noticed if I drink enough coffee, or if I don’t sleep enough (usually both together), I definitely reach into full-blown manic territory.

So basically, I can reach into the heights, to the point where I wonder how I’m not hallucinating, and I’m walking around the block at midnight in the snow to admire the beautiful colors, and I’m throwing chairs and stuff when I get mad, but it’s not my baseline state. It usually only lasts a couple of hours, and then I’m (presumably) back to hypo.

Is this a common experience?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

When I was expecting my second baby during covid, my husband by choice chose not to work. Prior to this, He was working long hours and travelled for work and eventually I assume he got burnt out and just couldn't do it anymore. Over the years, when he worked this job I would ask him to cut hours so he could spend some time with me and our first baby . He had a lot of debt and eventually paid that off but continued to work crazy, long hours. So for example, if we are going out as a family and he gets a call, we would turn back. He would drop us home and head to work.

I complained quite a bit to him about spending time together but he always explained he was doing it for us. I also told him that once he paid off his debt , lets be careful with the money as our family is growing. I also worked part time and I was easily able to take care of mine and my daughter's needs Alhamdulillah fairly well. Any money he gave I would save and eventually he would slowly take it back . I once remember him bragging to me that he was getting a raise and he made over 13K a month and I asked him awkwardly lol (since a husbands job is to provide) if I can have $500 a month. I am not a big spender but from what I understood he had a habit of getting into debt so I was planning on saving that money for a down payment on a home (which he promised we were going to buy). He however just laughed in my face and asked ""If I had been thinking about that for a while..."" I let it go. The debt was not from me. I noticed in their family, you could never really see where the money was going. No nice clothes or anything valuable in our apartment and was always stingy when it came to eating out. We would share a cup of coffee...until I lost it and said enough is enough lol

I never really knew how much he was making because I didn't have access to his accounts. He would show me any pending loans he had to pay off. He knew exactly how much I had and was pretty honest about my savings (which I regret a lot)

During my second pregnancy, he didn't work for a year and half (so again, he stacked up alot of debt. I was working to make my hours so I could receive EI during my maternity leave. In that time we also moved into our brand new home. I helped with half the down payment, took out line of credit for closing costs and helped financed our appliances for our home. I did tell my husband that the money I saved I wanted to use for furniture . He also would tell me strange things like how he borrowed money from his brother and father . I know that was a lie but he kept saying it to me before we entered our home. I ignored it.

When we moved into the home, I would tell my husband that we bought a home together and it's important that he goes to work so that we do not lose it. We have a family to raise . I look back to this and I don't understand why I had to convince this grown man to be responsible for us . I felt like I was carrying a lot on my shoulders and I had a very difficult pregnancy and post partum depression. I was told that there was a chance my son would be born with a genetic defect and because my husband was so unsupportive I would always be thinking ""How am I going to do this?"" This man is so irresponsible. Alhamdulillah, my son was born normal and healthy. I will always be grateful for this blessing. He is four years old now.

I was always asking my husband what he planned on doing in terms of work and in that time frame I also noticed he was becoming irritated with me. This was unusual behaviour and he would openly joke about getting a second wife. I noticed he would tell me he hated me and then apologize because he felt bad. At the time, I kept thinking I was the problem. I was very emotional and upset with him because I not only financially tried to make life easy for him but also was dealing with his disrespectful family members who were constantly causing issues. I felt like he didn't appreciate my efforts one bit because he was not doing his share in our marriage which was providing for us. I was frustrated because I felt I was doing everything.

I noticed he was also saying a name out loud in his sleep and I also heard it a few times ..him thinking out loud I guess. It was a nickname. One day, I saw him open his Instagram and I saw the name I heard him say. I also found the girl's picture and asked if this is that girl that he liked. He said ""yes"". I rolled my eyes and let it go.

YEars later, when he was away, I snooped through his computer and I found messages between him and that woman. I was shocked because I thought to myself I didn't even know this man could be this romantic. He was flirting lol. Meanwhile I get silent treatments when his mother, father , sisters, brothers are not happy with me. No affection, no spending time with me. I also came up in their conversation and she asked ""How is your wife?"". He said , ""She's nice"". That's it . His messages were from the time my son was 6 months old and I needed him to be a supportive, kind partner. This also makes sense why he was so annoyed with me because he was thinking about another woman.

When I told My therapist, she said ""What consequences did he get?"". I yelled at him when he came home and he said he knows he was wrong and was hoping to keep both of us. Delusional. He also said he just wasn't happy with me and didn't feel anything. I remember thinking to myself I should've picked up my kids and left before he came home and let him be scared. Consequence where he was going to lose me --that's what I should've done.

To this day I haven't gotten over it. Occasionally it'll come up and he will say to me ""That's not cheating"". I remember saying to him, I want that kind of attention for myself ..the kind you gave her. He dismissively said to me, he's never seen his parents be lovey dovey with each other. Unfortunately, he did see his dad repeatedly cheat on his mom. His brother has 4 kids and he was seen on a dating website by someone I know.

I get nervous about my babies. I pray they don't turn out to be like this.

1polq4p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1polq4p,Stanly Ranch Review,"**Overall Impression**

Stanly Ranch is an ambitious Napa Valley resort that’s hit its stride. The property feels warm, intentional, and quietly luxurious, a young resort (opened 2022) that’s figured out what it wants to be. Recent leadership under new GM Tom Donovan, who previously turned around Wildflower Farms, shows in the details: sharper service, more cohesive programming, confident execution. This is a well-designed resort that’s grown into itself.

**Location and Setting**

The resort sits on roughly 700 acres at the southern end of Napa Valley in Carneros AVA. The setting is peaceful and low-slung with a working-ranch feel.

The southern location is an asset for the right traveler. You’re an easy hour and a half from San Francisco or Oakland, well-positioned for Carneros wineries, and removed from the up-valley wine touring circuit. If you’re flying in specifically for intensive wine touring and want to be near Yountville and Rutherford, you’ll drive more. It’s carved out its own niche: spacious, activity and wellness-focused, genuinely family-friendly.

**Accommodations**

Rooms are spread across ranch-style buildings, stand-alone villas, and private houses give the property a neighborhood feel rather than traditional resort density. Landscaping has really matured and grown in these past few years, so that throughout the property, lush plants and large pollinators delineate pathways and provide privacy (and a lovely fragrance throughout).

I stayed in an Arbor room which had an outdoor shower and vineyard-side fire pit and outdoor seating area. Rambler rooms are the entry-level option which I’ve seen mentioned on this sub before - they’re fine for couples who don’t care about the outdoor shower (they don’t have them), but they’re not the reason to book here.

Villas are where this property shines, and what surprised me most: Stanly Ranch is an excellent family resort. All villas are two-bedroom layouts with full kitchens, living areas, and big outdoor space. Every unit includes a private patio and outdoor fire pit. Configurations are all queen-queen & king setups) and I can picture families actually using these spaces, letting kids play outside, spreading out.

**Pool and Spa**

I want to give the caveat that my family and I are pool/beach people. We bring our bathing suits everywhere we go and if a pool is unusable it is borderline catastrophic for our kids. The pools here are top notch.  They’re all heated to 87 degrees (see my steam/fog filled picture for proof). I swam in December and was genuinely happy (loved the huge hot tubs as well). If you have kids who are water dogs like mine, this place is a dream, especially in winter.

But moving on:

The real strength is the wellness infrastructure: Hale House and Spring House sit together on a dedicated acre designed for “thermal and restorative experiences.” This is one of the best spa setups in the valley, which makes sense. The Bay Area is at the epicenter of the longevity/biohacking trend, and the products, treatments, lotions and potions here all reflect that. I wish I had time to try them all.

Hale House anchors the wellness program with (very large) fitness center, movement studio, and spaces for yoga and meditation. Spring House delivers: cedar sauna, eucalyptus steam room, Himalayan salt room, cold plunge, and hyperbaric chamber (didn’t try but wanted to). The facilities are excellent and designed for guests who want to build wellness into their day, and for people who like to work out on vacation.

**Food and Drink**

I was in the valley specifically for some dining/winery appointments (shout out to my friends at Quintessa - I think their VIP tour is maybe the best in the Valley). I had a few meals at Bear - dining is solid and consistent, thoughtful, well-executed, appropriate to the setting. This isn’t a destination dining property per se, but you eat well and there were lots of locals hanging which is always a good sign. Something I appreciated: property wines (from vines planted throughout the property) are made by Hudson (very good and a smart signal of local credibility). Pastries at the coffee shop rival anything from Bouchon Bakery (nothing can top Model English Muffins but otherwise anything from there too).

I didn’t get a chance to dine there but I peeked into the new dining space, The Bloom Room (floral designer Edgar Martinez Ruacho has filled the private dining room with flowers turning it into “a superbloom”). If you have any interest in appealing to anyone on social media, book this posthaste and get your pics on Instagram. It was cool AF.

Finally, shout out to the minibar, stocked with complimentary soft drinks and genuinely excellent, small production local wines (Corison, Frogs Leap, Anthill Farms) and Rishi teas.

Food for Bear is partially grown on property, as well as eggs from their heirloom chickens and ducks. A very cute little side quest to visit them. 

**Experiences and Activities**

Programming is varied and authentic to the setting: sound baths (this is a California resort after all), falconry, guided hikes, ranch experiences like jam making, cooking classes and wreath making. The Little Ranchers program for kids is genuinely strong and makes this a viable family option in a region where most luxury properties ignore children. Full disclosure I have had family clients stay and love the program - and now seeing it firsthand I want to go back with my own kids to experience.

**Final Takeaways**

Stanly Ranch has found its footing: spacious, wellness-focused, genuinely family-friendly, with modern ranch aesthetics and strong event capabilities. The villas, thermal spa facilities, and southern valley location give it a different character than up-valley resorts—warmer, more relaxed, less wine-centric in tone. Recent leadership has tightened execution where it matters.

**Who This Resort Is For**

•	Wine travelers focused on Carneros AVA and southern Napa who want proximity to cooler-climate producers, sparkling houses, and Pinot Noir specialists

•	Families wanting Napa Valley with genuine kid-friendly infrastructure and accommodations that are set up for them

•	Wellness-minded travelers

When I was expecting my second baby during covid, my husband by choice chose not to work. Prior to this, He was working long hours and travelled for work and eventually I assume he got burnt out and just couldn't do it anymore. Over the years, when he worked this job I would ask him to cut hours so he could spend some time with me and our first baby .  He had a lot of debt and eventually paid that off but continued to work crazy, long hours. So for example, if we are going out as a family and he gets a call, we would turn back. He would drop us home and head to work.

I complained quite a bit to him about spending time together but he always explained he was doing it for us. I also told him that once he paid off his debt , lets be careful with the money as our family is growing. I also worked part time and I was easily able to take care of mine and my daughter's needs Alhamdulillah fairly well. Any money he gave I would save and eventually he would slowly take it back . I once remember him bragging to me that he was getting a raise and he made over 13K a month and I asked him awkwardly lol  (since a husbands job is to provide) if I can have $500 a month. I am not a big spender but from what I understood he had a habit of getting into debt so I was planning on saving that money for a down payment on a home (which he promised we were going to buy). He however just laughed in my face and asked ""If I had been thinking about that for a while..."" I let it go.   The debt was not from me. I noticed in their family, you could never really see where the money was going. No nice clothes or anything valuable in our apartment and was always stingy when it came to eating out. We would share a cup of coffee...until I lost it and said enough is enough lol 

I never really knew how much he was making because I didn't have access to his accounts. He would show me any pending loans he had to pay off. He knew exactly how much I had and was pretty honest about my savings (which I regret a lot) 

During my second pregnancy, he didn't work for a year and half (so again, he stacked up alot of debt. I was working to make my hours so I could receive EI during my maternity leave. In that time we also moved into our brand new home. I helped with half the down payment, took out line of credit for closing costs and helped financed our appliances for our home. I did tell my husband that the money I saved I wanted to use for furniture . He also would tell me strange things like how he borrowed money from his brother and father . I know that was a lie but he kept saying it to me before we entered our home. I ignored it. 

When we moved into the home, I would tell my husband that we bought a home together and it's important that he goes to work so that we do not lose it. We have a family to raise . I look back to this and I don't understand why I had to convince this grown man to be responsible for us . I felt like I was carrying a lot on my shoulders and I had a very difficult pregnancy and post partum depression. I was told that there was a chance my son would be born with a  genetic defect and because my husband was so unsupportive I would always be thinking ""How am I going to do this?"" This man is so irresponsible. Alhamdulillah, my son was born normal and healthy. I will always be grateful for this blessing. He is four years old now. 

I was always asking my husband what he planned on doing in terms of work and in that time frame I also noticed he was becoming irritated with me. This was unusual behaviour and he would openly joke about getting a second wife. I  noticed he would tell me he hated me and then apologize because he felt bad. At the time, I kept thinking I was the problem. I was very emotional and upset with him because I not only financially tried to make life easy for him but also was dealing with his disrespectful family members who were constantly causing issues. I  felt like he didn't appreciate my efforts one bit because he was not doing his share in our marriage which was providing for us. I was frustrated because I felt I was doing everything.

I noticed he was also saying a name out loud in his sleep and I also heard it a few times ..him thinking out loud I guess. It was a nickname. One day, I saw him open his Instagram and I saw the name I heard him say. I also found the girl's picture and asked if this is that girl that he liked. He said ""yes"". I rolled my eyes and let it go. 

YEars later,  when he was away, I snooped through his computer and I found messages between him and that woman. I was shocked because I thought to myself I didn't even know this man could be this romantic. He was flirting lol. Meanwhile I get silent treatments when his mother, father , sisters, brothers are not happy with me. No affection, no spending time with me. I also came up in their conversation and she asked ""How is your wife?"". He said , ""She's nice"". That's it . His messages were from the time my son was 6 months old and I needed him to be a supportive, kind partner. This also makes sense why he was so annoyed with me because he was thinking about another woman. 

When I told My therapist, she said ""What consequences did he get?"". I yelled at him when he came home and he said he knows he was wrong and was hoping to keep both of us. Delusional. He also said he just wasn't happy with me and didn't feel anything. I remember thinking to myself I should've picked up my kids and left before he came home and let him be scared. Consequence where he was going to lose me --that's what I should've done.

To this day I haven't gotten over it. Occasionally it'll come up and he will say to me ""That's not cheating"". I remember saying to him, I want that kind of attention for myself ..the kind you gave her. He dismissively said to me, he's never seen his parents be lovey dovey with each other. Unfortunately, he did see his dad repeatedly cheat on his mom. His brother has 4 kids and he was seen on a dating website by someone I know.

I get nervous about my babies. I pray they don't turn out to be like this.

1polpoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HMSCore/comments/1polpoa/are_you_searching_final_goal_of_life/,are you searching final goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pollxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1pollxi/tis_the_season_for_ecwcs_training/,Tis the season for ECWCS training...,"Getting to be that time of year again when we pull out our beloved smokers jackets and waffles. But lots of troops have no idea how to use the ecwcs properly, so let's teach them.  If you ACTUALLY know what you are doing. Quick primer for those of you with NCOs who don't know/care. 

The Extended Cold Weather System is a set of clothing items designed to keep you warm without overheating under exertion. Each different set is confusingly called a ""level"", which does NOT mean you have to wear all the layers under it to wear the next layer. The system is designed to be worn in 3-ish layers, though sometimes, as we will see, one layer can act as 2 layers. The first layer is the base layer, wicking moisture from the skin, the second layer is the insulating layer, providing warmth, and the third layer is the shell, providing weather resistance. Many times you will find that you will be more comfortable wearing less on your bottom than top.

First, a bonus layer! 

Level 0: your T shirt. not much to say here except one thing. If you have to wear one, and have high speed soffee or whatever t shirts, leave them behind in cold weather. They are cotton or a poly cotton blend, and cotton retains moisture and sucks warmth when wet, and dries slow. You want a polyester t shirt, for cheap stuff the basic training DLATS stuff at clothing sales works, or better yet any of the moisture wicking shirts up there. 

Level 1: the ""Silks"". This is the base layer of the system, and is designed to be worn against the skin. (Don't be a goober and wear it over your t shirt.) This layer has some mild insulating properties, and may be okay on its own (or just the top, yes you can wear the top without the bottoms) in mild temperatures, but its main purpose is to wick moisture away from the skin. You can wear this in lieu of your t shirt, (per ar670-1). Or you can wear your t shirt over it if you need just a tiny bit more, or want to avoid an argument. If you wear the bottoms, those ARE your underwear, dont wear your brown thunders under them. Almost always a base layer, but can serve as both the base and insulation layers in mild temps. Should not be excessively baggy, but not snug

Level 2: the ""Waffles"". This is a combination layer. It is both the second, heavier, base layer and also the first insulating layer (the one that retains body heat) and can be used as either or both. You can wear this against the skin as a base layer, combining moisture wicking and insulation, over your t shirt (remember, cotton kills), or over your Silks,  in that order of warmth. You can mix and match too. Silk bottoms, tee, and waffle top is a perfectly fine combo. Again, this can be used as a base layer OR an insulating layer, or act as both. Should again fit confortably, not loose or snug

Level 3: the Fleece ""jacket"". This is a contentious layer, and i probably wont make many friends right now. Yes, you can wear this as an outer shell or traditional jacket. No, its not a great idea unless there is no wind or precipitation and you know for a fact that there will be none. The fleece has exactly zero wind blocking properties, retains rain, mud, ect ect. However, the fleece excelles at retaining body heat. This is your most potent insulating layer. You probably should not have this on unless you are relatively static, and it works best under your level 4/5/6 top. The silks should be worn under this layer as a base layer, and for very cold weather may be combined with the waffles as well. This is an insulating layer, and should be tried on over the waffle top or ocp top for a comfortable fit. A good rule of thumb is to retain this layer in an east to access place, utilize it while static, and doff it before initiating movement or strenuous work. Also, compressing this layer (ex. Under body armor) limits its effectiveness, though not to the same degree as a puffer or woobie style clothing item like a smokers jacket.

EVERY LEVEL FROM NOW ON SHOULD BE TRIED ON OVER THE FLEECE JACKET TOP AND WAFFLE BOTTOMS FOR A COMFORTABLE FIT.

Level 4: the ""Windbreaker"". This is pretty much what it sounds like. This is a shell layer that is wind designed to keep the wind out, the heat from the insulating layers in, and has mild water resistance. This layer does not have a bottom, so it can be worn with either ocp bottoms or level 5 bottoms, and should be worn over any combination of base and/or insulating layers. PRO TIP: the chest pockets aren't pockets, actually. They are combination heat dumps and hand warmers. When you first start to feel yourself get warm, unzip the chest pockets and billow them open as much as you are able. This will allow heat to escape and is your first step in managing heat before removing a layer. These tend to run short so i recommend one size longer

Level 5: ""the Soft Shell"". This is another shell layer, but for slightly more adverse conditions due to the inclusion of pants and a hood. Just about everything said above applies to this layer as well, with just 2 things to add. If you have made it to this layer, you are no longer wearing either ocp tops or bottoms. Remember what i said about cotton blend t shirts? Your ocp's are a cotton blend and adding them into the mix will defeat the way the ECWCS works. Secondly, there is a notion floating around that this layer is waterproof, it is not a substitute for your wet weathers! It is water and wind resistant, and will soak through in any prolonged precipitation. There is also a school of though that the top should be sized to wear over your kit, thats personal preference. Get with an NCO with cold weather experience.

Bonus level 5.5: your IOTV/MSV. if you find yourself standing around in all your stuff, or are pausing for a moment and need a little warmth, instead of striping and adding layers, you can just throw your body armor on then take off. This works best with an IOTV, but it will put another layer over your core for short pauses, and if your top is sized to be worn over it, can be used as a last ditch insulation layer, just keep it loose to maintain airflow inside your sustem. Also a decent hand warmer. 

Level 6: ""extreme cold/wet weathers"". Look, i dont know whats extreme about this. I dont know the dofference between this and the wet weathers. I DO know what one of your 2 wet weather it is though, its the one with the silvery grey inside, not the black-grey ones. These ones do what they say on the tin, put them on when there is precipitation. I recommed you size these ones to he worn over the entire ecwcs, (level 1,2,3, and 5) and your other wet weathers sized to be worn over your kit. No one likes a wet IOTV. They are also the ultimate wind jacket. Try not to wear these during a movement if you can get away with it, you will sweat. PRO TIP 1: these dont stay waterproof forever. There is a waterproof spray that you get from supply (NSN in the back of the TM for ECWCS) that needs to be reapplied after every washing or hard rain. PRO TIP 2: get these bitches baggy and wear literally whatever the fuck you want under them. Woobie hoodie and pants, whatever.

Bonus Level 6.5: ""MOPP Gear."": make friends with CBRN guy and take your time figuring out what size fits comfortably over your other stuff, jacket and trousers. If you dont have marshmallows, this is your level 7. If you're mounted, youve probably gotta carry these with you anyways and they make a great emergency ""holy shit its cold"" shell layer for static conditions. The jacket is a halfway decent imitation m65 when sized right.

Level 7: ""Marshmallow suit"": size this to be worn over your kit and everything. If you have one, you're probably gonna get real cold weather training. Ive worn these exactly once, so i dont have much experience. I can give you 2 tips thought. This is a down type puffer material, so compressing it will make it not work anymore, so try not to lay down or put body armor over it. And it makes a fantastic parka liner. If you have these, go to the thrift shop, buy a set of wet weathers that fits over them, apply the waterproofing spray, and wear them over to ensure you dont get wet (static only). If its cold enough for marshmallows, getting wet if a serious safety issue.

Thats all for now, if i feel froggy later I'll do a post on FREE gear.

She is an amazingly gifted individual, a highly motivated B type personality. The type of person who is a good friend to anyone in need. She works at a non-profit during the day and volunteers in the community constantly, helping out with differing community non profits in the area. There’s no money in it but there’s a lot of joy.

She has been pondering since graduation to get another degree. With recent upper management complications at work, she’s made up her mind to quit her job and pursue a new 2 year degree that opened up at the university. Her and a friend from volunteering are both going to do this program. The friend has a plan for starting a business afterwards to support all these non profits. There’s already backing and she would like my wife to join her. This would be a great opportunity and she is very excited for this next chapter.

I’ve been the primary income earner in our household. I’ve always said, if she doesn’t enjoy doing it, then to find something else. She’s not frivolous or a job hopper but the time has come to do something different. Unfortunately, this lifestyle makes her financially dependent.

I work 40-70 hours per week at an absolutely soul sucking job. When I get home, I cook dinner. On the weekends I spend my time prepping our breakfasts and lunches, washing/ putting away all the laundry, cleaning the house, and whatever miscellaneous chores need to be done. I handle the finances, though she has more of a mind for it than I do. She’s very busy, so if it doesn’t have to deal with any events in her groups she will forget, I have to do the planning and execution.

Back in college, I had some health issues. The last (2) years these health issues have reared up again. She leaves everything on the floor, doesn’t put trash in the bin, and leaves dishes anywhere. It’s been very difficult to keep the energy to keep up during the week with these health issues right now. That means my weekends are now completely workdays. During these events and event planning, she will go out with her group to hobnob 3-4 times a week. It usually lasts anywhere until 11 or until 2 in the morning.

We’ve talked about it over the years but there’s never any change. She knows I’ll do it. She knows that saying she gets overwhelmed will be seen as an acceptable excuse.

I’m tired. I’m lonely. I’ll still make the coffee she likes every morning. I’ll make her favorite foods and make sure her weekly vitamin holder is filled. I won’t stop loving her. Once she finishes this program, Once she is financially stable and supported by this new position; she can have 80% of everything but she’s going to have to make her own coffee and put her own dishes in the wash.

My sister (35F, first time to Europe) and I (31F, several trips to Europe) just got back from our first Paris trip. I wanted to thank you all for your recommendations and suggestions in this sub; it was very helpful, so wanted to provide my experiences to maybe help someone too!

**The Stars**

\- Hotel Grand Powers (8e): outstanding service starting as soon as you arrive. Hot towels and champagne for check in, daily text messages to see how you're doing, Diptyque bath products. They gave me a hand-written birthday card. Amazing staff and along a quiet street. Would absolutely stay here again.

\- Motors Coffee (3e) and Good News (9e but there are several locations) satisfied my sister's insane coffee addiction. Good News was the few places we found that offered ""large"" coffees by her American standard. Motors had the best breakfast pastries. Try the orange one if it's available.

\- Maison Bergeron (7e): our favorite croissants of the weekend.

\- Several servers/baristas/shop owners allowed me to practice my day 32 Duolingo French. Some just answered in English, but most met me with patience and a smile as if they were saying ""thank you for trying"". I didn't feel discouraged at all not being a native French speaker and can't wait to keep learning.

**The Noticeably Good**

\- Marcello (6e) for Italian and L'Atelier Entrecôte et Volaille (2) for steak frites were our favorite dinners. The truffle special at Marcello and the burger at L'Atelier were surprisingly delicious. Simple service at both, no issues but nothing above and beyond.

\- Focaccia Novettino (9e but there are several locations) was our favorite lunch. Easy and fresh.

\- The SAs at the Rue Cambon Chanel were the friendliest and most helpful. Very patient and willing to show everything in stock. Did not have the same experience at the Rue Saint Honoré location.

\- My sister (a Disney adult, used to have annual WDW passes) LOVED Disney. It was very easy to navigate inside the park and the rides far surpassed their WDW counter parts. For me though (a non-Disney adult), I would've skipped.

\- Flying AirFrance in Terminal 2E was easy upon exit. Our carryon bags were not sized or weighed, which was a point of confusion for us before the trip.

\- We purchased physical Navigo cards for the metro since so many Americans seemingly struggle with loading them onto digital wallets. We found the physical cards so easy to reload at the stations and avoided all confusion.

\- The pastries/desserts at Pierre Herme were better than the macrons.

**The Not So Good**

\- On the Disney topic I didn't realize (due to jetlag, the lack of reliable public transit in the US, or both) that the RER A to Disney split in different directions. We ended up on a train going to Boissy Saint Leger at first, but realized the mistake before it was too late. We were able to switch to the correct train easily. So if you are going to Disney and take the RER, make sure your train is going to Marne La Vallee. It will have a Disney logo on it lol

\- Christmas market at the Tuileries was so uncomfortably packed. We made the mistake of going on Friday night, so I wish we could have seen it during the week.

The evergreen crown of the trees weeps its leaves / It’s always the same oak-scented breeze / One leaf flew over my head like a joke I didn’t get / Like an easy riddle that I refuse to guess / That leaf was about to land on my shoulder / Unbeknownst to me, a delicate hand reached over / She snatched it and kept it in her pocket / I walked this river as if nothing had happened / How I regret not looking back; it’s that scene / She came out of nowhere; I was not aware

Your bittersweet, musky voice ripens my cheeks / You hum your sultry songs; I can’t speak / There was a word, and it was on the tip of my tongue / Your choice of glances and phrases, a lack thereof / I gun myself never to make you my muse / Yet I cannot be the only one squinting as you / Fly up; I’m barely learning how to / Swift off your flaming bronze feet; can you wait for me / I’m only here to embrace the storm you made / Seasons may change, but my reasons stay the same

Some air must have blown the dirt out of my eyes / I see you clearly; I want you to be mine / Some rising tides, flooding my doors / It's clear that there are signs, only that I am yours

Broker here!

Before the year ends, here’s a checklist to squeeze the most out of your mortgage. Small tweaks now can add up to over $100k saved over 30 years, without changing your lifestyle.

1. Check your interest rate
Even a 0.5% drop can make a huge difference.

$600k mortgage at 6% to 5.5% = ~$68.6k saved over 30 years


2. Use an offset account
Parking savings against your mortgage reduces interest.

$50k in an offset on the same loan = ~$57.9k saved

Combine both rate drop + offset = ~$126k potential savings


3. Adjust repayment frequency
Switching from monthly to fortnightly repayments reduces compounding slightly.

$600k mortgage at 6% = ~$5k extra saved


4. Review unnecessary features
Some loans include redraw or insurance features you might not need. Removing them can lower ongoing costs.

Even small fees = $1–2k saved over time


Example for a smaller loan:

$450k mortgage at 6%, $40k in offset = ~$46k saved over 30 years


It doesn’t require cutting your coffee budget or lifestyle, just some strategic number crunchin. For anyone curious about what tweaks would make the biggest difference for their own mortgage, happy to help work it out.",4,1765939536.0,AUfrugal,2,0.84,False

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just *going through the motions* instead of truly living? Like your energy is a flatline and your focus is scattered like confetti? Yeah, been there. But I've stumbled upon some stuff that's genuinely shifted things for me, and I wanted to share in case it helps some of you too.

Let's ditch the overwhelm and talk about practical, *game-changing* hacks that can seriously boost your daily energy, sharpen your focus, and help you thrive, not just survive.

*   **The Power of the ""Micro-Win""**: Forget huge, daunting goals for a sec. What's one tiny thing you can accomplish *right now*? Making your bed? Drinking a glass of water? Answering that one email? These little wins are like fuel for your motivation. They build momentum and make the bigger stuff feel less impossible. Seriously, celebrate those micro-wins!

*   **Environment is Everything**: Your surroundings have a massive impact on your mindset and energy. Think about it: a cluttered desk can lead to a cluttered mind.
    *   **Declutter**: Start small, just one drawer or one corner of your room.
    *   **Natural Light**: Open those curtains! Sunlight is a natural mood and energy booster.
    *   **Movement Zones**: Designate little areas for different activities. A comfy chair for reading, a clear space for working out.

*   **Fueling Your Engine (Beyond Caffeine!)**: We all love our coffee, but what about real, sustained energy?
    *   **Hydration First**: Dehydration is a massive energy drain. Start your day with a big glass of water.
    *   **Nutrient Density**: Think whole foods. Avocados, nuts, berries, leafy greens. They're packed with sustained energy.
    *   **Strategic Snacking**: Avoid sugar crashes. Opt for things like a handful of almonds or an apple with peanut butter.

*   **Focus Multiplier: The ""Deep Work"" Sprint**: Ever get lost in a task for hours? That's the magic of deep work.
    *   **Time Blocking**: Dedicate specific chunks of time (even just 30-60 minutes) to one single, important task.
    *   **Eliminate Distractions**: Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs. Create a distraction-free zone.
    *   **Pomodoro Technique**: Work intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. It's surprisingly effective for staying on track.

*   **Mindset Reset Button**: Sometimes, the biggest barrier is our own thinking.
    *   **Gratitude Practice**: Before bed or first thing in the morning, jot down 3 things you're grateful for. It shifts your perspective.
    *   **Positive Affirmations**: Even if they feel silly at first, repeating positive statements about yourself can rewire your brain.
    *   **Embrace Imperfection**: Nobody's perfect. Give yourself grace. It's okay to have off days. The goal is progress, not perfection.

These aren't overnight cures, but little shifts that, over time, compound into massive improvements. What small hack has made a big difference in your energy or focus lately? I'd love to hear what's working for you all!

And hey, sometimes navigating these shifts can bring up a lot. If you're finding yourself struggling with emotional well-being, remember there are resources to help.

Hi, I (26F) work at the front desk of a small business hotel in a very busy area, and I think I need advice?Honestly, I don’t know if I made a grave mistake.

Almost every day, a homeless man enters our building to say hi, ask for water, say some random stuff, and then leave. (Before you ask me why I let him in: in my culture, we treat homeless people completely normally as long as they don’t represent a danger, and every receptionist had given him water/coffee before I even worked here.) He’s not drugged or drunk, but it seems like he has mental health issues because of past addictions. At first he never made weird comments, in fact, his talk was quite harmless about being friends with famous people and stuff like that. He does say some slightly misogynistic comments, but so do most men from my country.

Last month, he made a dirty “joke” that I did not like, and I let him know, it was a “joke” about me sitting on a dick. He apologized and didn’t come back for a few days, then came back like normal. After that happened, I’ve been denying him water and coffee, politely telling him multiple times that the reception space is only for guests, yet he keeps coming back. Every time I tell him the same thing, he says some nonsense and then leaves.

However, today he made a comment about raping me, which is completely unacceptable, creepy, and disgusting. I told him to leave immediately, to which he didn’t respond and just stood there. I repeated that he had to leave, and he began insulting me (not yelling, just insulting). Then I escalated the situation by getting mad. I started yelling at him, “YOUR COMMENTS ARE UNACCEPTABLE. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW AND DO NOT COME BACK.” “I DON’T WANT TO SEE YOU HERE OR I’M CALLING THE POLICE.” He stood there by the door, not wanting to leave, to which I responded by yelling in his face, “LEAVE AND DO NOT COME BACK.” When he left, he stood outside looking at me and insulting me from the other side of the glass window. He wasn’t yelling, but his face was so scary.

Now, I’m regretting it. Honestly, I don’t know what came over me. I never scream, but I was enraged. I don’t get paralyzed by sexual harassment, I get mad… I was so mad by the fact that this man is friends with nearby store owners, and he would never say that to the male workers in the area. I’m terrified because he knows where to find me, and you never know what someone like him is capable of, he was very mad.

Tomorrow I have to work… same hours, same place. What do I do if he comes back? Should I call the police the moment I see him enter? I’m thinking of keeping the door locked, but guests enter and leave all the time during my shift. Has anyone gone through something similar? I’m no longer mad I’m just terrified for my safety..

I've prided myself on fostering deep meaningful connections, and that includes people where a romantic relationship might not have worked but where there is still a person worth sharing friendship with. These two people were exes from years past, and content to be my friends (as far as I knew) with the occasional coffee catch-up and a call every now and then to see what's happening in each other's lives. But this year brought new, younger, partners their way and all of a sudden I found myself on the blacklist with no warning or communication.

It's like just because they are male, and I am female, that I absolutely cannot be trusted. Both these new partners have never spoken to me or know anything about me.
If they did, they'd know I'm not like...a horrible person that would ever threaten their relationship. The insecurity in these people is just incomprehensible to me.

From tights to veils - everything!

Irina barely had time to blink. The first blow was in the temple, the second - in the forehead.

\- What are you... what are you doing?! - the girl shouted, instinctively covering her face with her hands.

This story began with the fact that sometimes guardian angels interfere in our lives, protecting us from rash decisions.

Irina met Artem at the university. He was a teacher at the department, looked almost like a senior, but a strict look betrayed maturity and experience. He was about thirty.

Irina immediately attracted Artem's attention: long blond hair, slim figure, light smile, which made his heart beat faster. He often asked to stay after classes: check the tasks, discuss projects. Gradually, he became a ""special teacher"" for her.

Irina was flirshing with happiness. Not some classmate, but an adult, confident man takes care of her! The girls in the group were jealous, the guys were squinting, and she more and more often caught herself thinking that she really fell in love.

Artem took care of it beautifully: brought flowers, made morning coffee, gave a ride by car. Everything seemed serious, adult and almost fabulous.

Six months later, he offered her a hand and a heart.

\- Why delay? - he said, looking into Irina's eyes. - It's fate.

Irina was confused, but she heard only the main thing: ""fate"".

She immediately called her mother:

\- Mom, Artem made an offer!

Svetlana Viktorovna was silent for a long time.

\- Daughter... you're only twenty-two... Maybe you'll live together first? See how it will be...

Father, Nikita Ivanovich, frowned:

\- Who is this Artem? Let's look at it ourselves first.

But Artem insisted on introducing Irina to his parents first. Their house was spacious, with a fireplace in the living room and flowers on the windowsills. Olga Petrovna met Irina with a cold look, a restrained smile only increased the feeling of tension. Mikhail Ivanovich seemed good-natured, but almost silent.

At dinner, the questions followed one after another:

\- Where do your parents work?

\- How much do they earn?

\- How many years have you been studying?

\- How is your health? Are your monthly regular?

Irina answered honestly, but was embarrassed at the last question. She felt like she was on the exam without preparation.

When she said that her father was the boss in a large company, and her mother was a housewife, Olga Petrovna barely perked up:

\- I have money... Well, then you won't disappear.

Irina then did not understand that these words were not approval, but neglect. Artem looked only at his mother, as if enjoying her every line.

Irina's parents looked worried:

\- What a sloppy... - grumbled the father. - Will he be able to protect the family?

\- He's not an athlete... - my mother added. - Too cold look...

But Irina was blinded by love. One thing was ringing in my head: ""I'm a bride.""

The wedding was scheduled for August. Irina already presented a cream dress and a small bouquet of lilies. But the plans collapsed when Olga Petrovna said that Irina would get married in her dress.

\- You'll put on my dress, no talk! And no girlfriends, no ransom and nonsense! - she ordered.

Svetlana Viktorovna's daughter watched it with sadness.

Two weeks before the wedding, Irina came for a fitting. Artem was not at home, Mikhail Ivanovich was also absent. The apartment was quiet, only the clock was ticking quietly.

\- Well, Irochka, - Olga Petrovna said, taking out a dress from the closet, - be careful. It's thirty-five years old... not a joke.

Irina started pulling on new tights. And then the door suddenly opened.

\- What are you doing?! - the mother-in-law shouted.

Any single shooters here ? ( Coffee shooters lol)

CHAPTER ONE ""Congratulations, Viola! You have been promoted to the position of the Director of our Paris office."" My boss smiled at me from across her polished desk. ""Really? You're serious?"" I couldn't believe my ears. ""Dead serious! You'll need to relocate next month. I suggest you start making arrangements immediately."" I rushed out of the building with excitement. Paris! Brian would be so proud. Seven years of struggling together, and now everything was falling into place. I rushed home, eager to share the news with my fiancé. But when I unlocked our apartment door, I found Vanessa, Brian's dead best friend's sister sitting on our couch, her eyes red and puffy. She'd had these depressive episodes for months now, but Brian hadn't mentioned she'd be visiting today. ""Vanessa? What are you doing here? Is Brian home?"" I asked, setting my purse down. She looked up at me, her expression suddenly darkening. ""Why do you always have to ruin everything? Every time I come here, you make everything about yourself!"" I stepped back, confused. ""I just asked if Brian was…"" ""Shut up! You think you're so perfect with your fancy job and your perfect life! You have no idea what it's like to suffer like I do!"" Vanessa screamed, rising from the couch. ""Vanessa, please calm down. I understand you're going through a lot—"" ""You understand NOTHING!"" She lunged toward me, shoving me hard. I stumbled backward, crashing into the glass coffee table. It shattered beneath me, shards slicing into my arm and leg. ""Look what you made me do! This is all your fault! You're always provoking me!"" Vanessa shrieked. I tried to stand, blood trickling down my arm. ""Vanessa, you need help. ""This isn't..."" The front door opened, and Brian rushed in. His eyes darted between Vanessa's tear-streaked face and me bleeding on the floor. ""What the hell happened here?"" he demanded. ""She attacked me, Brian,"" Vanessa sobbed, running to him. ""I was just sitting here, and she came home in a rage, saying horrible things about Damien, about how I need to get over his death already!"" ""What? That's not true!"" I protested, wincing as I pulled a glass shard from my palm. ""Brian, she pushed me into the table! She's having another episode"" Brian's face hardened as he wrapped a protective arm around Vanessa. ""How dare you? After everything she's been through, you'd accuse her of this? I can see exactly what happened!"" ""But Brian…"" ""No, Viola! I've had it with your jealousy! Vanessa lost her brother, my best friend and all you do is complain when I try to help her!"" ""I've never complained about you helping her! But this is the third time this month she's had an outburst, and you refuse to see it!"" Brian's eyes flashed with anger. ""Get out."" ""What?"" ""You heard me. Get out! Go clean yourself up somewhere else. You're upsetting Vanessa even more!"" ""Brian, I'm bleeding…"" ""You're an adult, aren't you? Figure it out! Go take care of your injuries somewhere else. Maybe if you bleed a little more, you'll learn some compassion!"" His words cut deeper than the glass. Vanessa smirked behind him, her face hidden from Brian's view. ""How can you say that to me?"" I whispered. ""Just go!"" He shouted, pushing me toward the door. ""We'll talk when you're not being hysterical. I need to calm Vanessa down now. The door slammed behind me. I stood in the hallway, blood dripping onto the floor. Seven years. I had stood by Brian through everything after my parents died. He had found me at my lowest point and promised me forever. Then his best friend died, and everything changed. He had made that promise over Jason's corpse—that he would take care of Megan no matter what. I had sacrificed my dreams, turned down promotions, and canceled my art school scholarship all to help him build his career while I faded into the background of our relationship. I still remember the night he held me as I sobbed over my parents' graves, whispering that he would be my family now, a promise that turned to ashes in my mouth. I went to the bathroom down the hall to clean my wounds, wrapping a towel around my arm to stop the bleeding. When I returned to our apartment door, I heard sounds that stopped me cold. “Oh, Brian... yes... right there..."" ""You're so beautiful, Vanessa. You're all I need."" ""What about Viola?"" ""She means nothing to me now. You're the only one I care about."" ""Harder, Brian... please..."" My heart shattered into a million pieces. So this was the truth. Sending me away wasn't about calming Vanessa down, it was an excuse to be with her. I entered quietly, numb to everything but the pain in my chest. I went straight to our bedroom and pulled out my suitcase, throwing in everything I could grab. Brian appeared in the doorway, his hair disheveled, lips swollen. ""What are you doing?"" I didn't look up as I continued packing. ""I'm leaving. I'm done with your lies.""
Chapter 2

CHAPTER TWO ""What do you mean you're leaving? Are you serious right now?"" Brian's face twisted with disbelief. I clutched my suitcase tighter. ""I can't take this anymore. I'm bleeding because Vanessa pushed me through a glass table, and you're acting like I'm the villain!"" Brian ran his hands through his disheveled hair. ""Vanessa is having an episode and instead of being understanding, you want to leave? How selfish can you be, Viola? After everything we've been through!"" ""Selfish? I've given you seven years of my life!"" ""And what about Vanessa? She's lost everything! Her parents, her brother—Damien was all she had left, and now she only has us! You know she's fragile. You know she needs special care!"" ""And what about what I need? What about…"" ""God, it's always about you!"" He slammed his fist against the wall. ""I promised Damien I would take care of her. What kind of man would I be if I broke that promise? Is that the kind of person you want to be with? Someone who abandons people when they need help?"" Tears stung my eyes. ""That's not fair."" Brian's expression suddenly softened. He walked over and took my hands in his. ""Okay, I'm very sorry. I shouldn't have yelled. You're hurt. Let me take care of that wound for you."" I stood frozen as he began cleaning the cuts on my arm. The sudden change in his demeanor confused me. Just as he was wrapping a bandage around my arm, a piercing scream came from the living room. ""My head! Brian! My head!"" Vanessa wailed. Brian immediately dropped my arm, letting the bandage unravel. ""We have to go. Now."" ""But my arm…"" ""That can wait,"" he snapped. ""Come on, we need to take her to the hospital."" I stared at him in disbelief. ""Am I seriously expected to help take care of her after what just happened?"" Brian's eyes flashed with rage. ""Because of YOU, she's having an episode now! Come on, let's take her now!"" He rushed to Vanessa, scooping her into his arms while I stood there, wounds still fresh, my promotion news forgotten. He didn't even look back as he barked orders at me. ""Grab her purse! And don't forget her medication!"" At the hospital, Brian transformed. The man who moments ago had wished I would bleed more was now frantically calling for doctors, his voice breaking with concern. ""Please, someone help her! She needs immediate attention! Is there a specialist available?"" The nurses rushed Vanessa into an examination room while Brian paced the hallway, making calls to every doctor he knew. I sat alone in the waiting area, the memory washing over me like cold water. Last year, when I had that severe abdominal pain, Brian had simply told me to ""take a Tylenol and stop being dramatic."" By the time I called my colleague Sandra to drive me to the hospital, the infection had spread. The doctor said if I had waited even two more hours, I might have died. Sandra had stayed with me all night while Brian was ""working late."" I later discovered he was with Vanessa, comforting her after a bad date. Once Vanessa was stable, I slipped away. There was something I needed to get from the hospital—the small urn containing my parents' ashes. The only thing I had left of them after the car accident that took them both three years ago. When I returned to the hospital, Brian looked relieved. ""Thank God she's stable now,"" he said, not even noticing I'd left. Then he lowered his voice. ""If something had happened to her, you would have joined your parents soon enough."" My blood ran cold. Had he just threatened me? Vanessa emerged from the room, leaning dramatically against the door frame. ""I feel so weak,"" she whimpered. Brian immediately rushed to her side, scooping her up in his arms. ""I've got you, sweetheart,"" he whispered, his lips close to her ear. The way they looked at each other made me sick. Like I wasn't even there. ""Let's get you home,"" Brian said, carrying Vanessa toward the exit. I followed silently, clutching the small urn to my chest. When we reached the elevators, Brian pressed the button. ""Wait,"" I said. ""Can we take the stairs? You know I'm claustrophobic."" Brian rolled his eyes. ""Are you serious right now? I'm carrying Vanessa! We can't take the stairs!"" ""But I can't"" ""God, Viola! Can't you be considerate for once in your life? Vanessa needs to rest! She can't walk down five flights of stairs, and all you are thinking of is your irrational fear?!"" The elevator doors opened, and Brian stepped inside. I hesitated, my heart already racing. ""Get in or stay behind. I don't care anymore,"" he snapped. I stepped into the elevator, pressing myself against the wall as my chest tightened. The doors closed, and I felt the panic rising. My breathing became shallow, and the small space seemed to shrink around me. ""Brian,"" I gasped, holding out the urn. ""Please help me hold this. I can't—I can't drop it."" But at that moment, Vanessa moaned. ""My head is pounding again.” Brian immediately turned his attention to her, adjusting her in his arms, whispering soothing words. ""Brian, please,"" I begged, my hands shaking violently. ""It's about to fall—"" Too late. The silver urn slipped from my trembling fingers, hitting the elevator floor with a crack. The lid popped off, and the ashes—all I had left of my parents scattered across the dirty elevator floor. ""No!"" I cried, dropping to my knees. ""No, no, no!"" I tried to scoop the ashes back into the broken urn, but it was useless. Tears blinded me as I watched the last pieces of my parents disappear between the cracks of the elevator wall.
Chapter 3

CHAPTER THREE I knelt on the elevator floor, desperately trying to gather my parents' ashes with trembling hands. ""Viola, get up. You're embarrassing yourself. People are going to think something's wrong with you. This is exactly why I can't take you anywhere these days."" Brian hissed through clenched teeth. I looked up at him through tears. ""Something is wrong! My parents' ashes are all over this dirty floor! How can you just stand there?"" The elevator doors opened, and an elderly couple stepped back in shock when they saw me on my knees. ""Is she okay?"" the woman asked Brian. Brian flashed his charming smile. ""She's fine. Just having one of her episodes. My poor fiancée has... issues."" He tapped his temple meaningfully. ""We're taking care of her."" The woman's eyes widened as she pulled her husband back. ""Let's wait for the next one, dear."" As the doors closed, Vanessa's voice cut through my sobs. ""Just look at what you've done. You've made a complete scene, and now poor Brian has to explain your behavior to strangers. How many more times must he apologize for you, Viola? How much more can you put him through?"" Brian stepped out of the elevator when it reached the lobby, careful not to disturb Vanessa. ""Viola, we're leaving. Come now or find your own way home."" ""I'm staying,"" I whispered, still trying to scoop the ashes into the broken urn. Brian shrugged. ""Suit yourself."" I stayed behind, trying to salvage what little I could of my parents' remains, but it was useless. Most had disappeared between the elevator cracks or been trampled into dust. Eventually, I dragged myself out of the hospital and took a cab home. The apartment was quiet when I arrived. I went straight to our bedroom and pulled out my largest suitcase. Enough was enough. I couldn't take this anymore. I was folding the last of my clothes when I heard the front door open. ""Viola? Are you home?"" Brian called out. I wiped my tears quickly and stepped into the living room. Brian was alone, his face arranged in an expression of concern. ""Baby, I'm so sorry about what happened,"" he said, rushing to embrace me. ""I should have been more understanding. I know how much that urn meant to you."" I stood stiffly in his arms, not returning the hug. ""You're still upset, I can tell,"" he sighed, pulling back to look at me. ""But it was just a vase, Viola. We can get you another one. A better one—gold-plated, even! Your parents would want you to move on."" Before I could respond, his phone rang. He stepped away to answer it. ""Hey, what's up?... Yeah, she's here... Did she what?... Her stupid ashes?"" His voice dropped to a whisper, but I could still hear him. ""Don't worry about it. I'll handle her."" He hung up and turned back to me with a plastered smile. ""That was Vanessa. She's feeling much better now and wanted to apologize about your vase. Isn't she considerate? You'll forgive her, right?"" ""I've already forgiven her,"" I lied. ""Great!"" Brian clapped his hands together. ""Listen, there's this party tonight at The Sapphire. Let's go—it'll help clear your head. I want to make everything up to you."" Two hours later, we arrived at what was clearly not a small get-together but an elaborate event at a luxury hotel. The moment we walked in, I noticed people staring at us—or rather, at me. ""Your dress looks familiar,"" a woman whispered to her friend. ""Isn't that the same pattern Vanessa is wearing?"" ""God, she's such a copycat,"" another person murmured. ""No wonder he's clinging to Vanessa instead."" ""I heard she can't even keep her job,"" someone else said. ""That's why he's paying for everything."" ""She's so plain next to Vanessa. Like a cheap knockoff."" ""I heard she trapped him after his best friend died."" I looked down at my dress—a simple blue design Brian bought at a department store. As we moved further into the hall, I spotted Vanessa wearing an identical dress, except hers was clearly designer, with good beadwork and superior fabric. I suddenly realized why Brian had insisted I wear this particular dress. ""You knew,"" I whispered to him. ""You knew she'd be here wearing the same dress."" Brian's grip tightened on my arm. ""Don't start. We're here to have fun."" Vanessa spotted us and rushed over, greeting Brian with a lingering kiss on the lips. ""Thank God you made it! Thank you for helping me decorate this hall earlier for my birthday."" Birthday? I turned to Brian in confusion. Vanessa hugged me next, her expensive perfume suffocating. ""Thank you for coming, Viola. It means so much to have you here!"" So while I had been mourning my parents' ashes, Brian had been here helping Vanessa decorate for her birthday party. He'd told me we were going for a simple night out—not that we were attending the birthday celebration of the woman who had pushed me through a glass table this morning. I watched in horror as Brian wrapped his arm around Vanessa's waist. ""You look stunning tonight,"" he whispered, loud enough for me to hear. Vanessa giggled, pressing herself against him. ""You already told me that when you helped me zip up this dress."" I stood there, invisible, as they continued their intimate conversation. When Brian's hand slid down to Vanessa's waist, pulling her closer, I walked away toward the bar. ""Vodka, neat,"" I told the bartender, fighting back tears. ""Make that two."" I turned to find Vanessa standing beside me, a cruel smile playing on her lips. ""You know, Viola,"" she said, taking the drink from the bartender, ""I've always wondered what Brian saw in you. You're so... ordinary."" ""What do you want from me, Vanessa?"" ""I want you gone."" Her smile disappeared. ""Brian and I have been together for over a year now. The only reason he hasn't left you is because he feels sorry for you—poor, orphaned Viola with nowhere to go."" ""You're sick, Vanessa."" Her eyes flashed with rage. ""And you're pathetic. Still hanging on when he's made it clear who he wants."" She picked up a glass of red wine. ""Here's a little birthday gift from me to you."" Before I could move, she tipped the glass, spilling wine all down the front of my dress.
Chapter 4

CHAPTER FOUR The cold red wine seeped through my dress, clinging to my skin. I gasped, jumping back as people around us turned to stare. ""How dare you!"" I shouted, my voice trembling. Vanessa's eyes widened with fake innocence. ""It was an accident!"" Before I could respond, she grabbed another glass from a passing waiter and poured it over her own identical dress. ""Oh no! Look what happened to me too!"" she wailed dramatically. I stood frozen, confusion washing over me. Why would she ruin her own expensive dress? Brian rushed over, his face filled with anger. ""What's going on here?"" ""Viola pushed me!"" Vanessa sobbed, throwing herself into his arms. ""She ruined my dress because she was jealous that mine is designer and hers is cheap!"" ""What? That's not true!"" I protested. ""She poured wine on me first!"" The crowd that had gathered around us began whispering. I could hear their judgments. ""Poor Vanessa..."" ""That Viola is so jealous..."" ""I heard she's been harassing Vanessa for months..."" Brian's eyes narrowed as he looked at me. ""How could you do this? On her birthday?"" ""Brian, please! She's lying! I didn't…"" ""Enough!"" he shouted, silencing me. ""You've been acting crazy all day. First the scene at the hospital, now this?"" Vanessa buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with fake sobs. ""I just wanted us all to have a nice time..."" ""I know, baby, I know,"" Brian cooed, stroking her hair. He turned to me, his voice cold. ""You couldn't stand that her dress was better than yours, could you? You had to ruin it if you couldn't have the expensive one."" ""That's ridiculous!"" I cried. ""She's manipulating you!"" ""The only one manipulating anyone is you,"" he hissed. ""You've been trying to make Vanessa look bad since the moment you met her."" ""You're choosing to believe her over me? After seven years together?"" ""Seven years of what, Viola? Seven years of your constant neediness? Your jealousy? Your pathetic attempts to compete with Vanessa?"" Each word was like a knife to my heart. ""You know what?"" Brian continued, his voice dripping with disdain. ""I'm tired of making excuses for you. Tonight was supposed to be special for Vanessa, and you've ruined it—just like you ruin everything!"" Vanessa pretended to sway on her feet. ""I feel faint,"" she whimpered. ""I've got you, sweetheart,"" Brian said, lifting her into his arms. He turned to me one last time. ""Don't bother coming home tonight. I'll be comforting Vanessa."" As they walked away, I heard him whisper to her, ""I'm sorry she ruined your birthday. I'll buy you a new dress—anything you want."" I stood there, wine dripping from my ruined dress, as the crowd parted for them. The whispers followed me as I stumbled out of the party, humiliation burning my cheeks. When I finally made it back to our apartment, I went straight to the bedroom and pulled out my suitcase. This time, I was really leaving. My phone buzzed with a notification. It was Vanessa's social media update: ""His stupid fiancée tried to ruin my expensive dress out of jealousy, but my Brian is getting me a new one—even more beautiful than before! Can't wait to wear the wedding dress we picked out last month! #FutureMrsHuntington #CountdownToForever"" The post included photos of Vanessa trying on wedding dresses, with Brian smiling beside her in several pictures. The dates on the posts showed they were taken weeks ago. My heart shattered as I scrolled through them. They had been planning this wedding while I was still wearing his engagement ring. While I was still cooking his meals and washing his clothes. My phone buzzed with a message from Brian: ""Sorry about my outburst and making you feel disgraced. I've ordered that expensive case for your parents' ashes. Bringing it home soon. We can talk when I get back."" I deleted his number without replying. Then I reached into my purse and pulled out the divorce papers my lawyer had prepared earlier that week. I signed them and left them on the kitchen counter with my engagement ring on top. As I was about to leave, I noticed a small package on the coffee table. It was a wedding invitation—for Brian and Vanessa's wedding. Next month. So this was their plan all along. Push me out just before their wedding. Make me look unstable so no one would believe me when I told the truth. I grabbed my suitcase and took one last look around the apartment that had been my prison for seven years. Then I walked out, closing the door behind me forever. At the airport, I clutched my ticket—one-way to Paris. The weight of seven wasted years finally lifted from my shoulders as I walked through the terminal. ""Miss? Your boarding pass?"" the attendant asked. I handed it over with a smile. ""Thank you."" As I settled into my seat, I looked out the window at the city lights below. You took everything from me, Brian. Now watch me build an empire that will bring you to my knees",1,1765938696.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

The next few days run like clockwork. I wake up, get dressed, brush my teeth, and send Anna one of Ruthie’s photoshoot pictures. Clearly, she’s enjoying her time away; I get short messages back - some variation of ‘my cute/lovely/pretty daughter/Ruthie/baby girl’, and a ‘thank you so much for taking such good care of her!’ By day four, her responses are just emoji reactions. Fine with me. 



I’m not going through the rigmarole of changing a doll’s nappy twice a day, so I leave Ruthie’s on, and put a clean one in the nappy pail. That way, Anna will come home to freshly washed nappy cloths regardless. I do make her a bottle, though - I test the temperature on my wrist and everything - and ‘feed’ Ruthie for a minute or two. I just use the same bottle throughout the day - I stick to the feeding times, but I’m not making up 8 separate bottles a day for a doll. I feel bad putting the excess formula down the sink, but it’s clear Anna’s been using them, and I don’t want her to come back to full cans and accuse me of starving her imaginary daughter. 



Then, the rest of the day is mine. I can watch whatever I like on Anna’s big telly - no Mum over my shoulder turning her nose up at all of my watch suggestions, or commenting on how ugly she finds the actors. I really never wanted to go into childcare, but if most of the job is watching TV in peace, then maybe Mum was right after all. I can’t tell her that, of course. I’d never hear the end of it. I listen to music, I play on my phone. I relax, and I *feel* relaxed for the first time in a long time.



I go to bed at whatever time I like (which I’m annoyed to find out is not much later than Mum’s been demanding), and dress Ruthie in her onesie pyjamas before I settle down for the night myself. It can be fiddly fitting her bent arms into the narrow sleeves, but I manage. The novelty hasn’t quite worn off, so I have enough shots of Ruthie in different outfits to keep me going for at least an additional week. Job well done. 



The nightmares aren’t fun, but it’s easier to get out of bed in the morning when the adrenaline makes you feel like you’ve just snorted a line.



\-



On day five, my phone rings. It’s Mum. I stare at the phone screen for a moment, and consider rejecting the call. I don’t, though, and I take a deep breath before pressing the answer button. 



‘Hi, Mum.’



‘Abigail, it’s been nearly a week. I’ve been worried sick.’ 



‘Why? You know where I am.’ 



‘Do I? For all I know, you’ve run out on your job and gone to France.’



‘France?’ I ask, stifling a laugh. ‘Why France?’ 



Mum sighs exasperatedly on the other end of the phone. ‘Abby, please don’t change the subject. Why haven’t you stayed in touch?’ 



I try to think of a way to say *because being away from you has been absolute bliss* that won’t set her off, but I come up empty. 



‘I guess I’ve not been on my phone much.’ That’s a lie. I lost three hours to Instagram doom scrolling this morning. ‘Sorry, Mum.’



‘You’re definitely feeding the baby enough, aren’t you? They need more than three meals a day.’ 



I roll my eyes. ‘I *know*, Mum. There’s a schedule.’ 



‘And you can’t give water to a baby that young.’ she adds



‘Yes, we covered that in the course. Remember, that course I did for a whole year?’ 



‘I remember you saying that poor woman who taught you was barren. What would she know?’ 



‘I didn’t say she was *barren*, I said that she and her partner were trying IVF. She only told us because they thought one of the embryos might have taken.’ 



‘And it didn’t.’ Mum retorts.



*Peaceful thoughts*. ‘She had 30 years’ experience working with kids. I think she knew what she was doing.’



‘Well, let’s just hope you do, too.’ 



I hold the phone away from my mouth so that she doesn’t hear me trying to compose myself. I know Mum doesn’t have the most faith in me. I just wish she didn’t have to make it so bloody obvious. 



‘Thanks, Mum.’ I grit out. 



‘She sounds like she needs changing, Abby. When was the last time you changed her?’ I pull a face at my phone. Is Mum receiving messages from Ruthie via long-distance osmosis? The house is silent, save for the gentle hum of Anna’s double-door fridge, so I’m not sure what Mum thinks she’s hearing. 



‘You’re right,’ I say. ‘I’d better go and change her. Talk soon.’ I hang up before she can get another word in. 



I saw some Haagen-Daazs in the freezer earlier. I think I deserve it after a chat with Mum.



\-



For the first time in five days, I forget one of Ruthie’s feedings. For a second, I panic, before realising how silly I’m being. What’s she going to do, starve to death? Still, I can’t shake the weird guilt as I go up to the nursery for the belated feeding routine. I open the door with some trepidation, and Ruthie is…



Fine. Obviously. Still, I think the formula is starting to turn - I shouldn’t have left it so close to the radiator. There’s a slight sickly-sweet smell pervading my nostrils, and I have to breathe through my mouth so I don’t get nauseous. I pick up the bottle, and pick up Ruthie, and hold the nipple to her plastic lips. 



I stand there for a while, rocking the doll, staring out the window to the street below. No one looking in would be able to tell she wasn’t real, but the people passing by don't look up once, too focused on their journeys home from work. My mind wanders, and I think about Anna. How did she get to this point, and why is there no one looking out for her? 



Her partner left her, clearly. Maybe when they lost the baby, maybe when she got the doll. But then, maybe the doll was his idea. Maybe he left when she stopped treating it like a doll.



Where are her friends, her parents? I imagine myself in the same situation; insisting to Mum that she wasn’t a toy, that my baby had come back, *can’t you see her*?



For all my Mum’s faults, she’d never let me end up like this; playing house with a child that wasn’t really there. I snort then, realising that that’s exactly the situation I’m in, and all thanks to Mum, after all.



I start, suddenly. Tension in my scalp, a sharp pain. Looking down, my hair has gotten twisted around the doll’s arm, as if she’s reached up and pulled on it. I tuck her under my arm and fix my hair. I’m going loopy. Maybe this is how it started for Anna.



Enough. 



I put Ruthie into her crib, her plastic eyes staring straight ahead of her into the baby monitor camera. Grasping her by the skull, I twist her head around until she faces the wall. I don’t need a creepy doll staring me down all night. 



What I need is to feel normal again. I’ll go back to playing dollies in the morning; tonight, I need to be in the land of the living.  



Downstairs, I find a packet of microwave popcorn in the pantry, out of place amongst the supergrains and muesli. Perfect. 



I pair my microwave popcorn with a shit sauvignon blanc I smuggled in when I arrived, and even shitter television, and settle in for the night. Anna has properly posh throw blankets - thick and soft and so warm. I let myself imagine being in Anna’s shoes; maybe not the baby, but living by myself in a big, lovely house. Away from the oppressive atmosphere of Mum’s flat. Just space and quiet and independence. Maybe I could get my own fake baby to keep me company. I’d probably prefer a cat, though. 



My head starts to nod during the final 15 minutes of Love Island. I could fall asleep right here, but my anti-depressants wreak havoc on my skin if I don’t take my makeup off at night.  At least I can go through Anna’s cabinets and see what expensive products I can afford to take a swipe out of. Then I’d see how effective my Superdrug stuff *really* is. 



The credits roll, and I gather my bowl and glass to take to the kitchen. The baby monitor is on the counter, placed in a way that seems almost accusing. I feel a twinge of guilt; I had promised Anna I’d keep an eye on Ruthie. But exactly what trouble was a lump of unsupervised plastic going to get into? I dump my stuff in the sink, and pick up the monitor. Then nearly drop it again. 



I’d turned Ruthie away from the camera. Why, then, was she now facing it, mere inches from the lens? For a few minutes, my eyes are locked with the doll through the monitor, my heart pounding in my chest. Like I’m scared that if I take my eyes off her, she might suddenly vanish, then show up behind me or something.



*Get a grip,* I tell myself. I must have misremembered. Maybe there’s some sort of motor in the doll, like those backflipping dogs. Unlikely, but still more likely than the doll coming to life. I hurry up the stairs, storming into the nursery. Ruthie is staring straight at me with those painted eyes. I pick her up by the arm, dangling her as I push up her top and inspect her for a battery pack, or wires, or *something*. I drop her back into the crib, and take a few deep breaths. *The doll didn’t move. You just remembered wrong.*



I hate this feeling. I hate feeling like I can’t trust my own eyes, my own memory. *I thought I was doing better*. I have been. I spent six months of my childhood on a fucking psych ward, and I am not going back. 



I grab the knitted blanket that’s draped over the edge of the crib, and cover the doll. There. She can toss and turn as much as she likes under there, as long as I don’t have to see it.  



I go into Anna’s bedroom and find her Macbook on the desk. Sitting, I fire it up and start googling flights. 



It was a conversation I’d had with my therapist after my last attempt; *You don’t want to die, you just don’t want to be here. So why pick the nuclear option?*



She was right. Ending my life didn’t have to mean dying; it could just mean escaping to a new one. Suicide felt like freedom, but so could selling all my earthly possessions and working on a rice paddy in China, or volunteering at an animal sanctuary in the Dominican Republic. I could do anything, go anywhere, and I’d never have to speak to Anna, or Mum, or the girls from the ward again. 



For an hour, I research yoga retreats in some of the most remote locations in the world, then how to get hired at one. I look at nearby hostels, the local currency, traditional food from the region, until the buzzing in my head is finally silent. Then, I delete my browsing history, and shut down the laptop. 



It’s a coping mechanism, that’s all. I’m never actually going to up sticks and Eat, Pray, Love my way through Asia. It’s just not an option for someone like me, unless Anna decides to up my payment by several tens of thousands. But deleting my history is far cleaner and easier than scrubbing blood off Mum’s bathroom tiles at 2 in the morning. Still, I’m tired. My head hurts, and my body aches from the tension I’ve been holding in it. 



I go straight to bed without washing my face or brushing my teeth. I forgot to take this morning’s dose of medication anyway.  



\-



I can’t sleep, because the bed has lumps. Sharp lumps. I cry out as something digs into the flesh of my hip, breaking the skin. I inspect the damage, and there are tiny half-crescents carved into my skin, blood beading up in the wounds. Little fingernails. I roll over, getting tangled up in the duvet, clumsy with panic. Ruthie is crushed in the dip left by my body, her head at an unnatural angle, and her mouth gasping for air like a fish.



I wake up.



I fumble for the baby monitor, sure that Ruthie will have thrown off the blanket somehow. It takes me a moment to process what I’m looking at. But, despite my paranoia, I realise that the dark shape on the screen is just the blanket, exactly how I placed it. I force myself to slow my breathing down. 



*The doll is not possessed, get a grip.* 



Still, something’s wrong. The red light on the monitor is flashing. Not quickly or evenly, which might indicate a low battery, but lighting up randomly for a few seconds at a time. As if it’s picking up noise. I hold the monitor to my ear. Nothing. I turn the volume dial all the way to the right, then try again.



Silence. 



I twiddle the dial, in case it turns the wrong way, for some reason. Apparently not. Low battery? But the picture doesn’t flicker. I stand still, and strain my ears. The house is silent, save for the ticking of the kitchen clock, loud enough that I can hear it from downstairs. I approach the staircase, straining my ears for any noise. The monitor continues to flash, though the blanketed shape doesn’t move. 



Slowly, I creep into the hallway, padding along as if I’m afraid of rousing something. The blood is rushing in my ears, but it’s the only sound I hear. The door looms ahead of me, a portal to whatever chaos is being quarantined inside. I press my ear to the wood, but can only hear my own heartbeat.



I curl my fingers around the doorknob, knuckles blanching white as my grip tightens, but something stops me from turning. A creeping, rising dread in the pit of my stomach. I don’t want to see her. The idea of looking into her lifeless, painted eyes makes me sick, the nauseating sour milk smell suddenly coming back to me.



I let go of the knob. 



The light on the monitor has stopped flashing, and stays off. Ruthie, I decide, can look after herself tonight. 



\-



I sleep fitfully; waking up from half-remembered dreams of babies and shitty nappies and women in saris, before plunging back into sleep. I’m finally startled awake by a high-pitched scream. The adrenaline courses through my body as I sit straight up in bed. I wait, and listen, but no other sound comes. The scream must have been part of a dream; the sound produced inside my own head. 



The central heating hasn’t quite kicked in properly yet, so I pull my cardigan over my pyjamas, and steal downstairs, not sending so much as a glance towards the nursery door. I make a disgusting bowl of muesli with soy milk and bring it back to bed with me. I spend the entire morning watching TikToks on my phone, though I rarely manage to make it through a whole video, as short as they are. So much for taking this job seriously. Well, as seriously as you can take caring for an inanimate object. Anna doesn’t seem particularly preoccupied with the welfare of her daughter - she hasn’t even seen the message with the last photo I sent. Still, I send her one of Ruthie’s wake-up photos, sending it to my recycling bin afterwards so I don’t use it again.



Just after noon, the doorbell rings. I freeze. A parcel? Or a friend of Anna’s? I don’t want outsiders coming into the house, not with whatever sinister presence is lurking just beyond the nursery door. But if I don’t answer, they could tell Anna, who might worry and return, cutting the sit short. I force myself out of bed, and hurry downstairs. 



I shouldn’t have worried. Not about that, at least. It’s Mum. 



‘What are you doing here?’ I ask, opening the door and stepping back to give her space to enter. 



‘I wanted to see how you were getting on.’ Mum says, already scanning her environment. And I want to see that baby.’



‘You can’t.’ I say bluntly. ‘She’s sleeping.’



Mum purses her lips disapprovingly. ‘At midday? You should have gotten her up by now. And still in your pyjamas. I thought you were going to take this seriously.’ She tuts at me. I just stare back numbly. 



‘So? How’s the baby?’ she asks, labouring her words like I’ve refused to answer a question she never asked in the first place. 



‘Sleeping.’ I say again.



‘Yes, you said. How are you getting on?’ 



‘It’s fine. She’s really easy.’ 



‘Really?’ Mum eyes me. ‘You look like you’ve barely slept.’ 



‘The mattress I’m on,’ I lie. ‘It’s really uncomfortable.’



‘Don’t tell me she’s got you on boxsprings, a big house like this?’ 



‘It’s memory foam.’ I say. I don’t know why I feel the need to defend Anna. ‘I just find it too soft to sleep on.’ 



‘Oh, well; apologies for not getting you accustomed to memory foam mattresses.’ *Oh good, sarcasm*. ‘I did the best I could with the lot I was given.’



‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ I say wearily. Conversations with Mum feel like I should have warmed up for them, sometimes. 



‘It’s nice.’ Mum says, gesturing to the house; her attention already diverted. ‘I would have chosen a different colour for the walls, but maybe it’s a work in progress.’ 



‘I’m actually really busy today-’ I begin, but she cuts me off.



‘Nonsense, they’re easy at this age. Or is she making you clean for her, too?’



‘She’s paying me a lot of money.’ 



Mum tuts again. ‘Figures. I’m sure you’re cheaper than hiring a nanny *and* a cleaner.’ Moving to the kitchen, she sees my unwashed dishes in the sink, and shoots me a look. I pretend not to notice. Finally, she finishes her self-guided tour of the bottom floor, and waits expectantly at the bottom of the stairs.



‘Well, take me to the baby.’ 



I swallow. ‘I said no, Mum. She’s sleeping. She doesn’t sleep well.’ 



‘No wonder; you have her sleeping at all hours! Why would she sleep at night? Come on, I want to make sure you’re looking after the baby properly.’ 



I bristle at that. After all her insistence that this was my calling, pushing me into taking this job, she’s not convinced I can do it?



‘Anna asked that I don’t have visitors round.’ I say.



‘Good.’ Mum nods approvingly. ‘You’re caring for a baby, you’re not on holiday.’ 



‘That includes you.’ 



Mum sighs.



‘Darling,’ she begins, her voice dripping in faux concern. ‘You’ve not been well. This is a big responsibility for you, and unfortunately, you still need me to make sure you’re progressing forwards, not back.’ 



I swallow hard, and bite back tears. *I’m doing better. I am.* 



Aren’t I?



Mum’s timing, as usual, is spot-on. The weird stuff that’s been happening lately; I can’t help but worry that I’m slipping back out of reality. The pit in my stomach threatens to bubble over, and I try my best to breathe through it. 



Mum’s watching me, a vague expression of satisfaction on her face. Sometimes it feels like she wants me to stay sick. Stay reliant on her. I can’t let her live my life for me. 



‘I’d like you to leave, please. I’ll see you when the job is finished.’ 



Mum cocks her head condescendingly. ‘It’s nice to see you assert yourself. But I need to check on the baby.’ She begins to climb the stairs, and I get a flash of her finding Ruthie under the blanket. How would I even begin to explain? Even if she believed that Anna was the one who thought the doll was real, she’d probably end up getting *her* sectioned. 



‘Why don’t you run out and pick us up some coffees?’ I try, my brain working overtime to get her away from the stairs. ‘My treat. There’s a lovely little coffee shop at the end of the street.’ 



‘You go.’ Mum replies immediately. ‘I’ll stay with the baby.’ 



‘Anna would kill me.’ I gabble, adrenaline thumping in my chest as she inches closer upstairs. ‘She said specifically that I had to be with her at all times. She said the only reason she hired me was because she trusts me, and she’s never been able to trust anyone else. Plus, I’m pretty sure there’s cameras, so she’d know.’ 



I’m just talking, now. Mum’s not an idiot, but my half-panicked rambling wouldn’t convince her even if she was. But she has paused her journey up the stairs, at least, and turns towards me slowly. 



‘Oh, God.’ Mum says, her eyes widening in melodramatic horror. ‘You’ve not done anything to the baby, have you? *Have you, Abby?*’ 



‘What? No, of course not. She’s fine. Ruthie’s fine!’ I need to get her out of the house. My chance to tell Mum the truth has well and truly passed; I can already see her working herself up, and if she finds out the truth, she’ll come up with some ridiculous theory - I killed the real Ruthie and buried her under the floorboards. There never was an Anna, and I’ve just broken into someone’s house to play a reverse Norman Bates. Or, most likely, that this is some jab at her; a convoluted metaphor for her horrible parenting that I’ve set up, because *everything* is about her.



‘Get *out,* Mum.’ I say, surprising myself at the quiet threat behind my firmness. Mum also falters for a moment. But then, her expression turns nasty. I know this look all too well; the curled lip, the bright eyes. The *sneer*. The mask hasn’t slipped for a while. We got the hang of playing Mum and Daughter while I was on the course, because for so long, her favourite role was bully. 



‘The thing is,’ she spits, through gritted teeth, ‘your track record with babies isn’t the best, is it, love?’



It’s like a punch in the gut. She always knows exactly what to target. When I was younger, I used to wish she would just hit me instead. At least I’d have bruises to show someone, bruises that would fade with time, and not stick around for years after, haunting me every time I tried to sleep. Chipping away at my sanity, until I’m being tackled to the ground at 14 years old with a bloodied compass in my hand and deep red gashes trailing up my arms.



‘Don’t.’ I murmur softly. Mum just nods, her expression regretful but her eyes still fierce.



‘I have to, Abby. No baby deserves what you did, and if I can save this one from a similar fate, then it’s my moral responsibility.’



*I hate you*, I think, repeating those words over and over in my head until I’m silently screaming them at her. But I don’t dare open my mouth. If the waterworks start, she wins.



‘Now,’ Mum continues, her voice still low and dangerous, ‘I’m not leaving here until I know that little girl is alive and well, because I just can’t trust you, my darling.’



‘Please, Mum.’ I choke out. Mum just smiles, then turns and starts back up the stairs. As soon as her back is turned, I slump against the banister. Of course she wins, she always wins. This was my chance to get away from her, if only for a while. Time for the house of cards to fall down.



Halfway up the staircase, Mum stops. She turns back to me, her face registering something like…disappointment? I search her face for some clue for what comes next. 



Just like that, the mask is back in place, and she sighs heavily. 



‘Well, I’m relieved.’ she says. ‘I don’t know what all the melodrama was about, Abby, I really don’t.’



I watch her in stunned silence. I can’t work out what just happened. Is this a trick? Is she trying to distract me so she can tackle me into submission? I step back as she descends down the stairs, just in case, but she moves past me, towards her bag and jacket. 



‘I have neither the time nor energy to go through this again, so you get your wish; I’ll leave you alone. Natasha will be pleased; she’s probably been feeling quite neglected with all the time I’ve spent worrying about you instead of looking after her. And in the state she’s in, too.’ she adds, reproachfully. 



Tash will definitely not be pleased. I’d gotten a mardy text from her a couple of days ago, sarcastically thanking me for freeing up so much of Mum’s time that she was now able to turn her attention on Natasha and her bump. Mum was never as awful to Tash as she was to me, not by a long shot, but it doesn’t mean she can stand her either. 



It takes another minute or so to usher Mum out the door, and my arm is itching to slam it in her face. Before she finally leaves, she tells me,



‘You know I’m proud of you, don’t you?’ 



It *hurts*. The insincerity, the gaslighting. The fact that despite everything, I *want* her to mean it. I roll my eyes to hide the tears welling up in them, and her lips purse. 



‘I think you should probably check on the baby.’ are her pointed, parting words. It takes every ounce of my mental fortitude to close the door without slamming it behind her.



I go to the couch, bury my face in Anna’s thickest, fluffiest cushion, and I scream and scream and scream. 



It’s the first night in this house that I don’t dream. 



\-



In the morning, I go to take a shower - I was instantly enamoured with the rainfall shower, and have been using it daily - but my hand falters on the tap. I’ve ignored the big, clawfoot bath under the window. I can’t even remember the last time I had a bath. It was CAMHS’ treatment of choice whenever I’d ring them for help, but the pokey little tub in Mum’s bathroom wasn’t so much a suicide deterrent as it was an inviting receptacle for a toaster. This, however, was a bath you got in for pleasure, not one you got crammed into with your sister after a muddy day at the park. There was a basket so chock-full of Lush bath bombs that I could take one without it being missed. And besides, hadn’t Anna told me to make myself at home? 



I use a bath bomb *and* bubble bath. They kind of cancel each other out, but the real luxury is being able to use either without Mum in my ear warning me about bacterial vaginosis. The bath is absolutely *steaming*, and I dip my fingers into the colourful, soapy surface. I snatch my hand back out. Of course, someone like Anna wouldn’t be relying on a crappy boiler that only got going once the bath was half-full. I brace myself and plunge my hand back in to pull out the plug, dousing my hand with the cold tap before I can feel the burn. 



While I leave the water to equalise to a more bearable temperature, I nip to the kitchen for a hot chocolate. I’ve well and truly given up on the coffee machine, but a hot bath and a fancy Whittard’s hot chocolate almost make the whole haunted doll thing worth it. I check my phone while the microwave heats up the milk, swiping away the message and voicemail notifications from Mum. She hates me giving her the cold shoulder; that’s *her* strategy. If I ring her back, she’ll start acting aloof; as if I’m not the one returning her call. She’ll string me along until I finally apologise, like I always do. But I don’t need her; I can handle this. I’m a fucking adult now; a fact I think she’d like me to forget sometimes. 



Mug in hand, I make my way back up to the bathroom. A few more minutes of twiddling with the taps, and I finally have a bath that’s a decent temperature. I slip into the water, and lean back against the sloped end of the bath. 



For a few minutes, it’s wonderful. Peaceful and warm, the concoction of bath products just short of being overwhelming. But then, I remember exactly why I stopped having baths. 



\-



I’m twelve years old and I’m staring at a pregnancy test I swiped from Boots; the cheap ones they don’t lock away in the cabinets. 



‘What does two lines mean?’ Elliot asks. Even at that age, in that moment, I recognise the irony of having to explain how a pregnancy test works to the grown man who’s made it necessary for me to use. 



‘Pregnant.’ I say. My voice doesn’t sound like mine. 



‘Check again.’ he says. 



‘What the fuck do you think’s going to change?’ I snap. ‘Two lines means pregnant, check it yourself.’ I pick the box up from the sink and throw it at him. I was so bold back then; I didn’t even care that it would probably earn me a slap. He doesn’t move, though, and the box hits him in the shoulder, before falling to the floor.



‘I can’t be a dad.’ he says blankly, and I let out a wordless shriek, pushing him out the door and slamming it in his face, my knickers still around my ankles. 



*I’ll kill you if you end up like me*, Mum had always said. I’ve beaten her record; pregnant two whole years younger than she was. The tummy ache I’ve been feeling for weeks straight is worse than ever. There’s a *baby* inside me. I want to vomit and vomit and vomit until it comes out, but even I’m old enough to know that’s not how it works. 



Naked from the waist down, I stand in the filthy bathroom and contemplate what comes next. 



I’ll get fat and throw up every morning. A great, disgusting whale that smells of sick and cries all the time. I have vague memories of Mum pregnant with Tash. She’d always been so glamorous and energetic, and suddenly she was this big, angry lump on the sofa, who never had the energy to wash herself or tidy up. For the first few months of her life, I hated Natasha for it. I used to give her little head or body a smack when Mum was out of the room. It didn’t matter; I always got shouted at when the baby started screaming; whether it had been my fault or not. 



I’ll have to stop going to school. I’ve only just been deemed cool enough to hang out with Daisy and the other girls; the bullying would be even worse than before. Not just a chav, not just a crybaby, but *worse.* All the names I’ve used on other girls I know; skank, slut, sket. Short, guttural words you can spit at someone, or hiss under your breath when they pass.



Elliot will go to prison. I can tell the police it wasn’t him, but Mum will sing like a canary once she knows her suspicions were true. She loves being right, much more than she loves me. I’ll get put into foster care; maybe Tash too. Besides, if one of Mum’s kids could go so astray, it must be her parenting. We’ll get dragged out of the house in front of the neighbours, and Mum will never talk to me again, even when I’m older, and the father of my child is a registered sex offender. 



Because then, there’s the baby. They’ll make me keep it, probably, like Lila from over the road did, even when they put her in the group home. I’ll have to feed it and bathe it and change its shitty nappies, and pretend that I love this creature that’s ruined my entire life. 



But I have options. Babies are delicate, even more so before they’re born. After all, Mum had tried her hardest to keep her pregnancy after Tash. She was determined not to have the same complications that had come up with baby number 2, so she ate healthy, rested as much as possible, and took so many pills and vitamins she could have run a pharmacy out of our medicine cabinet.



And it still died inside her. 



\-



I can hear a baby crying. 



I clamber out of the bath. All the therapy, all the medication, all the fucking *years*, and the memories are still vivid as day. I know better than to let myself go back there, but here I am; in a nice, head-clearing bath - like a clear head isn’t exactly what I always try to avoid. 



I don’t bother towelling myself off; I just pull last night’s knickers and t-shirt onto my wet skin. I hate the feeling, but it’s comfortingly distracting. The crying continues, needling its way into my head. I hum, trying to drown it out. It’s so lifelike - high-pitched and desperate, with a raw edge to the sound. 



It’s coming from the nursery.



I burst into the room, dripping water and bubbles all over the floor. The sound persists, seemingly muffled under the blanket that covers Ruthie. 



Five things I can see; blanket, crib. Don’t break down. Window. Four things I can touch; who cares? Three things I can hear; screaming. Why is the doll screaming? Dolls don’t scream. I can’t hear two other things, it’s just *screaming*, filling up my head until it’s about to explode. Screaming, my screaming this time. Do I sound scared or do I sound angry? I don’t know, I can’t think shut up shut up *shut up*.



I rip the blanket off, and the screaming stops. Mine and hers. But her plastic has turned to flesh, and it’s a real baby squirming under my horrified gaze. 



I know who’s haunting me, now. I never gave you a name. It would have made you real. But you’re not real; you’re a memory, and Ruthie is a doll. I know what you want, but I can’t give it to you. I pick Ruthie up by her onesie; I couldn’t bear to feel skin instead of plastic. She dangles in my hand as I take her through to the bathroom. 



I remember your face - eyes blinking up at me from the bottom of the toilet bowl. Your little mouth opening and closing for a moment before I flushed you away; like you were trying to form the word *mama*. Of course; you didn’t have a face. You couldn’t have been more than 7 weeks of growth - you weren’t baby-shaped yet, just a clump of blood and tissue, like everyone says. But I saw you clearly, a fully-grown newborn with tiny fingers that reached for me. And I pulled the chain. 



I’m sorry, but you’re going back into the water. It’s where you belong. At least the bath probably smells nicer. This whole house seems to reek of rotten milk.



\-



I climb back into the spare bed, still naked and dripping wet. I don’t feel tired, or scared; I don’t feel anything. Just a slight ringing in my ears from the screams. Maybe I sleep. More likely, I stare at a blank wall for hours on end.  



\-



The sun is setting by the time I finally drag myself out of bed. My hair feels neither dry nor wet, but some stiff, greasy combination of the two. I feel empty. Physically empty - I haven’t put anything in my body since the two sips of cocoa I managed before my bath - but also spiritually empty; exorcised. I wish it felt like a relief, to have the metaphorical monkey off my back, but there’s a creeping dread I have to push down; like I’ve lost some vital part of myself. 



Ruthie is still floating in the bath; plastic once more. I pick her up and hold her to my chest in some ghoulish parody of skin-to-skin contact. I just hold her and rock my body from side to side, water running down in rivulets between my breasts.



‘Sorry.’ I mumble to her.



I’m not ready to live on my own; that much is clear. I’ll finish out the week, then tell Mum I’m sorry, and can I stay in my room? She’ll pretend to be annoyed, or disappointed, but secretly, she’ll be glad. Things are always good for a while once I’ve admitted that I need her. She’ll remind me to take my medication more regularly, and I’ll go back to the bland, agreeable shell of a person I’ve been until recently. Turns out that *is* the better-case scenario.



I carefully dress Ruthie in the prettiest dress I can find in her tiny wardrobe, and tuck her into her crib. I even press a kiss to her tiny, plastic head. Then, I go back to bed.

I don't really drink and we are thinking about having the engagement party early saturday afternoon so out of town guests don't have to stay over for the night if they don't want to. 

I'm considering having the theme be ""I love you a latte"" and primarily offering fun coffee drinks as opposed to alcohol (although alcohol will probably still be offered). 

Has anyone done something similar? Do you have any suggestions on decor/food options that go along with this vibe? (Photos highly encouraged!)

The other engagement parties I have been to have all been at night so I'd love to hear about alterntive options! ",9,1765938431.0,weddingplanning,1,0.85,False
1pokxiy,https://i.redd.it/qz7q1vvldo7g1.jpeg,Protein Coffee in morning,"Hello everyone. 

Im thinking about trying a 16:8 intermittent fast to help with weight loss. When I wake up in the morning and head to work, would it be okay if I have one serving of this each morning? It’s only 110 calories per serving. I recently switched to this and really enjoy it. I used to drink regular coffee with a lot of creamer, which added a lot of extra calories, so this feels like a much better option for me.

Im also new to fasting. Any tips would be awesome. Thank you!! ",3,1765938428.0,fasting,10,0.59,False
