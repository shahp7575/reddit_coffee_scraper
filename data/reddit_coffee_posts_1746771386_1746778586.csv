You can have a 4.0 GPA, a polished resume, 10 certifications...  
and still get ghosted by companies.  
Meanwhile, some dude who had coffee with the right person gets the job. Why? Because networking beats credentials. Every. Single. Time.

It took me way too long to accept this. I used to apply to 100+ jobs a month.  
No replies.  
Then I attended one random event, talked to a stranger about startups over beer, and boom – I got invited to a project that led to my first real paycheck in months.

No CV. No job portal. Just one conversation.

Since then, I’ve:

* Landed clients without cold emailing
* Found mentors just by DMing people I admire

Crazy how everything changes when you stop screaming into the void and start talking to actual humans.

So yeah – your degree matters. But your ability to connect? That’s your real superpower.

Does anyone know any really good brunch places with truly impressive coffee? I wanted to go get brunch with my mum for her birthday, but it is hard to find places in Brisbane with coffee that have great depth in flavour.

My sister got married at twenty and had my nephew at twenty-one. Me? Twenty-seven, still unmarried.  
  
Over the years, I've brought several boyfriends home. Each time, my dad invites them into his study for a ""chat.""  
  
But every single guy who walks out of that study—guys who were all lovey-dovey with me before—suddenly gives me the cold shoulder afterward. Some even look like they literally want to strangle me.  
  
And the latest guy? He thought my dad was a total jerk and swore he'd stand up for me. But after he stormed out the study, he dumped me on the spot, and even slapped me across the face twice.  
  
I'm completely baffled. What's the real reason they all leave me? What secrets in that study??  
  
\---  
  
""You are such a disgusting slut!""  
  
""Next time I should just let your boyfriends kill you. Maybe then you'd learn your lesson!""  
  
After my boyfriend stormed out, Dad turned on me, face twisted with rage.  
  
Actually, I've dated five guys over the years. Every single relationship ended the same way—badly. And every single guy changed after visiting Dad's study.  
  
I'd like to believe people don't change that quickly, but the evidence is right in front of me.  
  
I frowned at Dad, waiting for an apology that would never come.  
  
The look in his eyes said he'd rather tear me apart.  
  
He seemed genuinely disappointed my boyfriend hadn't strangled me on the spot.  
  
Dad's always favored my sister. When I first wanted to date as a teenager, he forced me to break up immediately. Meanwhile, my sister got married the second she turned twenty. Why the double standard?  
  
Watching my brother-in-law move in, seeing how tenderly he treated my sister every day—I envied their happiness, their future together.  
  
Whenever I looked their way, Dad kicked me to the ground, screaming that I should never even think about marriage.  
  
When my sister and her husband went abroad for their honeymoon, Dad made me kneel at home as punishment for... just being me, I guessed.  
  
He even had my sister tell me not to get married, saying I'd ""ruin someone's life.""  
  
I've wondered if maybe I was adopted, but hired a private investigator who confirmed I's definitely his biological daughter.  
  
Totally lost, I vented online. The guesses came pouring in:  
  
""Maybe you were born on the day of his big business deal? Cost him millions, so now he's getting revenge.""  
  
""Bet you look like his mistress and your mom hates you for it, so your dad also hates you.""  
  
So I started snooping again, but Dad's a teacher, never had any business dealings. And he's never cheated—not once.  
  
I just didn't understand why he's so determined to keep me single forever.  
  
The irony? I's gorgeous. I meet amazing guys constantly, but nothing ever works out.  
  
Finally desperate, I asked my uncle to talk some sense into Dad.  
  
""Your daughter's found someone she loves,"" Uncle told him. ""Parents should support their children's happiness, not mess up. What's wrong with you?""  
  
Dad said nothing. He just stared at my uncle, grabbed his hand, and led him into the study.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After they left the study, Uncle's once gentle gaze had turned into nasty and mean. He not only dropped the ""let me date"" talk, he even kicked me straight in the chest.  
  
""You worthless bitch! You think you deserve love at your age? As if!""  
  
My aunt arrived looking for Uncle, witnessed the whole scene, and tore into him. But after Dad took her into that damn study too, she came out telling me I should forget about marriage forever or she'd poison me herself.  
  
Something was seriously wrong. What the hell was in my father's study that could completely flip someone's entire attitude toward me?  
  
Even my little sister—we've been close our whole lives—started lecturing me about how I should ""enjoy being single"" and ""why ruin that with marriage?""  
  
She secretly burned all my photos with ex-boyfriends and blocked their numbers in my phone, determined to keep me from having any contact with men.  
  
I lay awake at night, my mind racing. The whole situation was beyond creepy.  
  
At least Mom was still on my side. But with three restaurants to run, she worked dawn till dusk and had no idea how they treated me at home.  
  
I've cried, screamed, and broken down after each breakup. Nothing changed.  
  
Ugh, that disappointment hit me so hard, it was like my chest had a giant hole. The wind just whooshed through it, y'know? Freezing me from the inside—literally felt like my heart turned to ice.  
  
Dad glanced at me with disgust before sitting on the couch to watch TV like nothing happened.  
  
I stepped directly in front of the screen, dead serious.  
  
""Dad, just tell me the truth. Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you? What about me bothers you so much? Can't we just talk about this like normal people instead of... whatever this is?""  
  
We're family. If there was a misunderstanding, we could just clear it up.  
  
But Dad wouldn't even look at me, just stared coldly at the TV screen.  
  
""I've told you. No dating. No marriage. If you disobey me, I'll kill you myself.""  
  
Then he turned his black eyes on me, shooting me a glare.  
  
I shuddered—my spine turned to ice.  
  
He wasn't joking. In the next moment, he jumped up, stormed into the kitchen, and came back with a cleaver, running at me like a maniac.  
  
I ran to my room, locked the door, and called my best friend to get the police.  
  
They arrived quickly, my bestie right behind them.  
  
A female officer immediately subdued my father, knocking the knife far away. Only then did I dare come out.  
  
""Mr. Blackwood, you're under suspicion of attempted murder. You need to come with us to the station for questioning.""  
  
Despite being arrested, Dad looked completely unfazed. He wasn't scared at all.  
  
My bestie saw the cut on my arm where the knife had grazed me and went pale, tears streaming down her face.  
  
She punched my father, furious beyond words.  
  
""What is wrong with you? That's your daughter!""  
  
""You'd rather kill her than let her get married?""  
  
She covered her face, sobbing uncontrollably.  
  
I knew if the cops weren't there, she would have beaten him senseless just to make him pay for what he'd done to me.  
  
At least someone in this world genuinely cared about my happiness.  
  
The cops questioned my dad about why he did it, but his face stayed blank, showing no regret—like he did nothing wrong.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My bestie stood up, waving her phone around.  
  
""I have evidence! Fiona's been through five boyfriends since she was twenty, and her dad ruined every single relationship! He even got them to hurt her with words and hits! I have all the injury photos she sent me. These monsters need to face justice!""  
  
The moment she finished, my dad let out this creepy-ass giggle, his face twisting into something straight out of a horror movie.  
  
He motioned for the cops to loosen their grip on his arms, then turned to my friend.  
  
""Fine, take me in. But first, I need to grab some important evidence from my study. You can all come with me if you're worried I'll try to escape.""  
  
My blood turned to ice in my veins.  
  
I immediately blocked the study door, cold sweat drenching my clothes, eyes red and desperate.  
  
""No! None of you can go in there!""  
  
If I was right, anyone who followed my dad into that study would come out completely changed—just like everyone else had.  
  
Seeing how scared I was, my bestie wrapped her arm around my shoulders.  
  
""Fiona, it's okay. The police and I are here now. Your dad can't hurt you anymore.""  
  
She looked at me worriedly, but I wouldn't let go of the doorknob, holding it for dear life—fingers almost numb.  
  
My eyes were total chaos—scared shitless and helpless as hell. The cops? They just stared, confused—probably thought I was losing it.  
  
The female officers walked over with soft, reassuring smiles, gently pulling me aside.  
  
""It's alright, Fiona. We're just letting him get something. He can't possibly hurt you.""  
  
I shook my head wildly, tears streaming down my face and splashing onto the floor.  
  
""Please, you can't go in there. You just can't.""  
  
The way I freaked out only made them more curious about what secrets the study might be hiding. I knew I'd blown it.  
  
One officer even told me to stay put, while everyone else followed my dad inside. I couldn't stop them.  
  
My bestie even had the nerve to mock him, saying, ""Let's see what tricks you'll pull now that you're screwed! You tried to murder your own daughter—you're going down, no matter what!""  
  
She was the last one to enter the study.  
  
She even turned back, winked at me, and smiled reassuringly. With her there, everything would be fine.  
  
I stood there like a statue, my emotions going haywire—heart pounding, hands shaking, brain total static. I couldn't move, couldn't think—just...frozen.  
  
Honestly, part of me prayed they had stronger willpower than the others and wouldn't be affected by whatever my dad did.  
  
Even if they went in, my bestie's gotta be on my side, right? She definitely wouldn't ditch me.  
  
God, I was so naive.  
  
Through the crack in the door, I watched her expression transform from fearful to panicked, then shift entirely to rage and hostility.  
  
She was so angry she slammed a coffee cup onto the floor.  
  
Boom! Pieces everywhere—I just stood there, shook.  
  
My dad lifted his head smugly, like this was exactly what he'd expected.  
  
When they stepped out, my friend smashed her phone onto the floor—crash!—then turned to the cops with a weak, sorry smile.  
  
""I'm so sorry, officers. Mr. Blackwood was just trying to bond with his daughter. He never meant to hurt her. I completely misunderstood.""  
  
The officers frowned, their faces darkening as they stared me down.  
  
""Don't ever file false reports again! This is just a verbal warning, but next time you won't be so lucky!""  
  
I collapsed to the floor like a deflated balloon.  
  
Their complete reversal proved I'd never get help again.  
  
My ""bestie"" dug her fingernails into my head.  
  
""Listen up! If you hadn't lied about being murdered, I wouldn't have made a false report. You better seriously think about what you did!!""  
  
They all gave me dirty looks before letting my dad loose and storming out.  
  
As soon as the door snapped shut, my ex-bestie's face practically deformed into this bitter, cruel sneer, and she stared me down like I was her worst enemy.  
  
She even rushed into the kitchen, grabbed two huge knives, and shoved them into my dad's hands, practically begging him to chop me up on the spot.  
  
""Uncle, you're so right—Fiona is absolute trash! She has a perfectly good life but just HAD to go dating. Since she's so disobedient, you might as well kill her now!""  
  
""Worthless bitches like her are just wasting oxygen on this planet—she should just DIE!""

I am currently working in retail and applying for jobs. I have been invited to a handful of interviews so far, and a recruiter casually mentioned, while on the phone, that I was ""lucky X company was willing to reschedule my interview [because you were at work], as usually they are not that flexible and if you can't make it to the interview, then it means you don't want the job that much"".

I was quite appalled and calmly explained that my being unable to attend the interview on the first proposed day was not because I didn't want the job that much. I was scheduled to work and, since retail is the way it is, I couldn't just not show up, especially since I have the keys to the shop. She insisted that I could have done the interview on my lunch break, or got someone to cover my shift. I thought it'd be useless to tell her how unprofessional it was for me to hop on an interview for another job at my current one, and even if I did it from, say, a coffee shop, either I would have made a bad impression, and I wouldn't have been able to focus. Even so, my lunch break is shorter than the proposed interview time, so I would have been late to clock back in and I was going to probably get an earful from my manager.

Anyway, I feel I definitely might have been a little inflexible, but I wanted to hear from other retail workers. To me, this sounded quite shocking coming from a recruiter. Telling me I'm not getting the job because I was not compliant enough with the company's schedule when they gave me a few days notice at best was rude. But also not being able to understand that working in retail is not as flexible as many other 9 to 5 office jobs. If I'm not there, nobody's on the shop floor, and with only a few days notice I could not find anyone to cover my shift. I work in a very small company anyway, and when I asked around, nobody could help me out.

## Key Features Analysis

The top water filter coffee makers of 2025 boast a range of features designed to optimize both water purification and coffee brewing.

**Integrated Water filtration System:** This is the core feature, usually comprising a replaceable charcoal filter designed to remove chlorine, calcium, and other impurities from the water before it enters the brewing chamber.

The charcoal filter typically lasts for a specific period, such as 40-60 brewing cycles, and replacement filters are readily available. The effectiveness of the filtration is a key factor, with higher-end models frequently enough featuring multi-stage filtration for superior water quality. Some systems also include indicators that alert users when the filter needs replacing.

**Programmable Brewing:** Most modern water filter coffee makers offer programmable settings, allowing users to set a specific brewing time in advance.

This is particularly useful for those who wont to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Programmable features often include variable brew strengths, allowing users to customize the coffee's intensity to their preference. Some models offer settings for bold, regular, or even iced coffee.

**Carafe Material and Design:** The carafe is a critical component, as it holds the brewed coffee and influences temperature retention.

Carafes are typically made of either glass or stainless steel. Glass carafes are more common and frequently enough come with a warming plate to keep the coffee hot,while stainless steel carafes are known for their superior insulation,keeping coffee hot for extended periods without a warming plate. The design of the carafe spout also affects pouring accuracy and minimizing drips.

**Brewing Capacity:** Water filter coffee makers are available in various brewing capacities, ranging from small single-serve models to large 12-cup options.

The ideal capacity depends on the household's coffee consumption habits. Single-serve models are perfect for individuals, while larger capacities are better suited for families or frequent entertaining. Some models offer the versatility to brew smaller batches, such as 4 or 6 cups, while still utilizing the full filtration system.

**Automatic shut-Off:** For safety and energy conservation, many models feature an automatic shut-off function.

This feature automatically turns off the coffee maker after a set period, typically 2 hours, preventing the appliance from overheating or wasting electricity.This is especially beneficial for users who may forget to manually turn off the coffee maker after brewing.

**Water Level Indicator:** A clear water level indicator is essential for accurately filling the coffee maker with the correct amount of water.This feature typically consists of graduated markings on the water reservoir, allowing users to easily see the water level and avoid overfilling or underfilling. Some models feature electronic water level sensors for even greater accuracy.

## Core Benefits

Water filter coffee makers provide a multitude of benefits, from improved coffee taste to added convenience.

**Enhanced Coffee Flavor:** the primary benefit of a water filter coffee maker is the noticeable improvement in coffee flavor. by removing impurities such as chlorine and sediment,the water used for brewing is cleaner and purer,allowing the natural flavors of the coffee beans to shine through.Users often report a smoother, less bitter taste, with a more pronounced aroma.

**Improved Health and Well-being:** Filtering your water before brewing coffee can contribute to better overall health. By removing harmful contaminants, you reduce your exposure to potentially harmful substances that may be present in tap water. This is especially beneficial for individuals with sensitivities to chlorine or other water additives.

**Convenience and Ease of Use:** Water filter coffee makers are incredibly convenient, eliminating the need for separate water filtering steps. The integrated system streamlines the brewing process, making it faster and more efficient. Programmable features further enhance convenience,allowing users to set their brewing schedule in advance.

**Cost Savings:** While a water filter coffee maker might represent a slightly higher initial investment compared to standard models, it can lead to cost savings in the long run.By filtering your own water, you avoid the need to purchase bottled water or use separate water filters, potentially saving money over time. The use of reusable filters instead of paper filters can also contribute to cost savings.

**Prolonged Appliance Lifespan:** Using filtered water reduces the build-up of mineral deposits within the coffee maker, which can prolong its lifespan. Hard water can cause scaling and corrosion, leading to decreased performance and eventual failure. By using filtered water, you help protect the appliance from these damaging effects.

**Are Water Filter Coffee makers Difficult to Clean?**

Many models have removable parts that are dishwasher-safe. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**What type of Coffee Beans Are Best to Use With a Water Filter Coffee Maker?**

im almost 17 y/o girl, live in a pretty big city. but i rarely go out somewhere. everytime i do step out to touch grass im always looking for excuses why i need to go out and not work.

also also, going out for me is either A) going to buy bread in nearby grocery store; B) going to grab coffee with a friend; C) going to meet my parents as they come home from work  
and that's it.

when i had to go to school i had at least some human interactions and more social events. but now for almost a semester now, i've been homeschooled. i struggle with organisation (even though it never was my kind of problem before), self-doubt and depressive episodes.

i do have friends, if I can call them that. it's like about 4 girls, they all live nearby, but they rarely call, text or invite me places. when we do meet, when i invite them, they tell me about how they spend their time together and i just feel so bad and jealous. i know it's a bad feeling, but im tired of caring about everyone when no one cares for me. or at least it feels like it.

i just had surgery and out of three people who knew about it only one girl reached out. it breaks me thinking about it tbh.

my family doesn't have much money, so i can't afford to go to some clubs, although i'd love to go dance, draw, animate, sing, perform, or talk about books, like do anything.

and i keep seeing pics of my friends and this amazing comedy channel smosh and i feel lonely.

it kinda sounds like im whining, but i honestly just want to feel better and truly enjoy my teen years, since i don't have much of them left. i guess it's just fomo and fear of growing up, since after school i'll have a bunch more responsibilities drop on my head, so i want to learn to enjoy myself and be happy with my life, not be stuck in four walls 24/7 with 20 minute walks now and then.

any advice, pls?

p.s. smosh is my escape tbh. i really like their content and it makes me laugh and lifts my mood. what i meant is i see their friendship and the games they play, the discussions they have and just feel sad that i can't have the same with my friends",2,1746777210.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False
1kid0ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1kid0ci/an_immigrants_law_school_story/,An Immigrant’s Law School Story,"I fought for this.

Through visas and closed embassies,
through whispered prayers at airport gates,
through late nights with textbooks
that smelled like someone else’s future.

I haven’t seen my family in five years.

Not on birthdays.
Not when the seasons turned.
Not when my grandmother died,
her hands still smelling like rosewater
through a phone screen
blurred with pixelation and grief.

I watched her funeral over WhatsApp,
hunched between library shelves,
biting my lip to keep from sobbing too loud
while outlining Civ Pro with a shaking hand.

There are days the pressure presses on my ribs until it feels like I’m breathing through a straw:
“Make it count.
Make it worth it.
Be the one who made it out.”


I thought law school would be the answer.
The thing I could hold up to the world and say:
This is why I left.
This is what I built out of the ache.

So I came here—
with a visa and a dream so fragile
I wrapped it in silence
and carried it across oceans.

And I worked.

God, I worked.

⸻

I studied on trains,
in bathroom stalls,
in the hour between cleaning shifts and morning lectures.

I ate plain rice with salt
so I could send money home.
Wore threadbare shoes
so I could buy the textbook
no one would ever ask me about in class.

I stayed up learning cases
while texting my brother:
Don’t go out tonight. Stay safe.
Then flipped the page
and underlined “reasonable doubt”
with a trembling pen.

And still—
my GPA wasn’t high enough.

Not because I didn’t care—
but because I was tired.
Because I was trying to survive two lives at once.

⸻

When OCI came,
I pressed my only suit
until it held me like armor.
Memorized answers I didn’t believe in.
Learned to say “team-oriented” and “fast-paced”
when what I meant was:
I need this.
Please pick me.
I’m tired of surviving on hope.

They asked me why I wanted to work there.
I said something about growth.
What I meant was:
Because I don’t know where else to go.
Because I’m scared I’ve already given too much.
Because I haven’t hugged my parents in half a decade,
and I need to make this distance worth something.

⸻

They didn’t pick me.

Not one.
Not a single offer.
Just a slow stream of emails that began with
“Unfortunately”
and ended with silence.

My friends celebrated—
clinking glasses,
choosing cities,
shopping for new lives.

I smiled for them.
Said, You deserve it.
Then locked myself in a bathroom stall
and let it all fall out of me,
like water from a cracked jar.

It wasn’t just rejection.
It was grief.

The kind that pools in your bones
when no one calls your name
after you’ve shouted it
into the void
for years.

⸻

I don’t feel brave.
I feel like I’m held together
with safety pins and stubbornness.

But I’m still here.
Still answering my mother’s calls
with a voice that doesn’t shake.
Still telling her, It’s going well,
because she doesn’t need more sorrow.

Still wiring money home
with hands that tremble from too much coffee
and not enough sleep.

⸻

I don’t know what happens next.
I’m scared.
I’m tired.
I miss home so much it makes my teeth ache.

But I keep going.
Not because I’m brave.
Not because I’m certain.
But because failure is a luxury I was never allowed.

Because I’m already here—
and maybe that’s the most radical thing I can do.

Because being an immigrant
means learning to live with closed doors—
but knocking anyway.

It means carrying disappointment quietly,
so your family doesn’t hear it in your voice.

It means finding pride
not in the titles you didn’t get,
but in the fact that you’re still standing
on ground that was never made for you.

⸻

They didn’t want me.
But I’m not leaving.

I’ll find another way.
A different room.
A future with my own name on the door.

Because I didn’t come all this way
just to be chosen.

I came to become.

""I've spent seven years trying to be the perfect girlfriend, the perfect secretary. But I've always known, him. I've always known your heart belonged to her."" 💔  
  
Chapter 1: Dakota Lennix  
  
I hurried towards the bus stop, my heels clacking against the pavement, juggling two duffel bags and two cups of latte. My heart sank as I watched the bus pull away, leaving me behind. Only 18 minutes left before my boss leaves for his meeting, and I'm stuck here without a ride. I scanned the street frantically, hoping for a taxi.  
  
Oh no... this can’t be happening.  
  
The office is 12 blocks away, and there’s no way I can run there in these shoes, especially with these heavy bags. Not to mention the lattes—no one wants spilled coffee everywhere. I waved desperately at the street, praying for a taxi to appear.  
  
""You! Brunette with the bags! Need a ride?"" A taxi driver called out to me from across the street. Without a second thought, I ran over and jumped inside.  
  
""Denver office, please! And hurry!"" I gasped, trying to catch my breath.  
  
""Got it,"" the driver said with a smile as he pulled away. I took out my phone, checking for any last-minute instructions from my boss. Nothing. Relief washed over me for a moment.  
  
The driver's name was Eddy Brown, and he looked to be in his 40s. I let out a deep sigh, grateful to be sitting and moving again.  
  
""You know, I'm surprised to see someone like you carrying all that,"" Eddy said, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I chuckled softly.  
  
""People tell me that all the time. I think it's part of why I got hired,"" I replied, staring out the window, watching the city rush by.  
  
""I'm Eddy, by the way,"" he said, his tone friendly.  
  
""Dakota. Thanks for the save back there,"" I responded with a small laugh.  
  
""No problem. Here we are,"" he said, pulling up in front of my office building. I handed him a $20 bill and started to get out.  
  
""Hey, your change!"" he called after me, but I waved it off.  
  
""Keep it. You saved me today. Thanks again, Eddy!"" I called as I dashed into the building.  
  
With three minutes left, I maneuvered through the crowded lobby like a race car driver. I pressed the elevator button repeatedly, willing it to arrive faster. Come on, come on...  
  
Finally, the doors slid open. I slipped inside, pressing the button for the 20th floor. The elevator crept upwards, and I stared anxiously at my watch, counting the seconds. When the doors finally opened, I bolted towards my boss’s office, knocking twice before stepping in.  
  
He was on the phone, gesturing for me to come in. I quietly placed the two duffel bags next to his desk and the two cups of latte—his afternoon ritual—on his desk. He nodded in acknowledgment, sipping his drink while continuing his conversation. I stood by, waiting for his next instruction. Without looking up, he pointed towards the window. I quickly grabbed the remote and closed the blinds.  
  
After a few more minutes, he hung up the phone. “Cancel all my meetings until Saturday. I’m heading to Vancouver,” he said curtly.  
  
My eyes widened in surprise. “What’s your plan in Vancouver, Mr. Denver?” I asked as I began crossing out his schedule for the next few days.  
  
“Just book the flights. You’re not coming,” he added.  
  
I couldn’t help but smile internally. That meant four days without having to deal with him—a mini vacation!  
  
""Yes, Mr. Denver. Should I book the earliest flight tomorrow?"" I asked, pulling out my tablet to make the arrangements.  
  
""Yes, and book the last flight on Saturday for the return,"" he replied, not even glancing my way.  
  
I made a note of it. ""Anything else, sir?"" I asked.  
  
“You’re in charge of overseeing the construction project while I’m gone,” he said, still not looking up.  
  
I froze. “Isn’t that Bob’s responsibility?” I asked carefully.  
  
“I just fired him,” he said flatly. “He was... distracted during work hours.”  
  
I sighed inwardly. My short-lived dream of four days off was already gone. ""Understood. Is that all, Mr. Denver?""  
  
""Send me the flight details, and you know the drill,"" he said with a wave of his hand, signaling the end of our conversation. I nodded and left the office.  
  
Back in my own office, I collapsed onto the sofa, exhausted. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen and saw my father’s name. With a heavy sigh, I answered.  
  
""What is it, Dad?"" I asked, bracing myself.  
  
""Grandpa’s in the hospital,"" he said gravely.  
  
I rolled my eyes. ""Not this again, Dad. You’re not fooling me this time,"" I said, exasperated.  
  
""I'm serious, Dakota. This is no joke,"" he insisted.  
  
""Really? Because the last time you said that, he was golfing the next day,"" I replied, skeptical. But then, he turned on his camera, and I saw Grandpa lying in a hospital bed. My heart dropped.  
  
“Alright, I’ll come,” I said reluctantly, ending the call. So much for a relaxing weekend. I quickly booked my boss's flight to Vancouver, then one for myself to LA.  
  
Once everything was set, I knocked on Mr. Denver’s door.  
  
""Mr. Denver, I need to go to LA tomorrow morning. Family emergency,"" I said, hoping he wouldn’t make it difficult.  
  
He glanced up. “Go ahead. You’ve got two days. Ask Cynthia to cover for you,” he said nonchalantly.  
  
""Her name is Cynthia,"" I corrected him quietly before handing him the flight details. He waved me off, and I returned to my office to continue working, mentally preparing for the whirlwind ahead.",1,1746776775.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

If you drink alcohol, you most definitely are taking a drug - it's called ethanol. You're taking drugs when you swallow a Tylenol for that headache - it's called paracetamol.

I’m planning to buy an espresso machine and I’m deciding between the ECM Mechanika MAX PID and the Profitec Ride. The price is about the same for both. I want a machine with a stainless steel boiler, and ideally a product that uses as much stainless steel as possible and limits the use of plastic, brass, etc.

I like the Mechanika MAX, partly because it’s only 27 cm wide, so it doesn’t take up much space. I’ll mainly be using the machine for two people, which means making two coffees in a row, like flat whites. I don’t want to have to wait too long between the two shots. From what I understand, the ECM MAX should handle that without any issues. I read one comment that said there can be some temperature problems after the fourth shot, but I won’t be making that many anyway.

I believe the MAX might have slightly better internal components than the Profitec Ride, but I haven’t found any detailed information on that.",1,1746776413.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

what it means to protect people when you’ve got nothing left.

**Prologue — “The Ring Polisher Goes to the Movies”**

John Stewart was not a hero.  
Not anymore.

He sat in a worn-out theater seat.  
In his left hand: an old polishing cloth.  
In his right: a ring, dull and metallic.  
A green loop that had once orbited the stars.  
Now, just... a quiet scrap of metal.

Onscreen: a superhero movie played.  
*Green Lantern (2011).*  
Meaningless CGI flashes. Emotionless dialogue.  
The theater was nearly empty.  
One person was nodding off.

Beside him, his nephew’s eyes sparkled.  
“Uncle, were you really Green Lantern?”

John shrugged.  
“No. I just polished the ring.”

The kid laughed.  
Onscreen, the hero flew through the skies in green light.  
John closed his eyes for a moment.  
There were memories of falling.  
Faces of vanished comrades.

There was light—  
but no direction.

So he kept polishing the only thing left in his hand.  
Memories remained.  
Justice had disappeared.  
But responsibility…  
might still be clinging on somewhere.

When the movie ended, the air outside the theater was cold.  
His nephew ran around, holding an ice cream.  
John took the ring out of his pocket.

Under the streetlight, it still didn’t shine.

And then—  
from somewhere above,  
a faint green flicker in the sky.

John looked up.  
No one else seemed to notice, blinded by the city lights.  
He didn’t smile.  
He just stared at the ring.

And almost whispered, like to himself:  
“...didn’t think you’d respond.”

The ring trembled slightly.  
Like a memory taking its first breath again.

John slid the ring back into his pocket.  
Whether it was hope or just a mistake—  
he’d need more time to find out.

“Was I Green Lantern?”  
“...That’s for the ring to decide.”

**EPISODE 1 —** ***A Name Not Erased***

""Turning away is quieter than surrender.  
But names never erased always find their way back.""

John Stewart polishes the ring every morning.  
It’s not for show.  
He doesn’t wear it anywhere.  
The glow is gone. The shine is faded. The function is dead.  
It’s just metal now.  
Still—he wipes it with the same cloth, every day.

As if today might come out different if yesterday’s grime is gone.  
As if polishing it could erase the screams of that day.

He knows it won’t.  
But he does it anyway.

He doesn’t call himself Green Lantern.  
Every time he even thinks the word,  
it sounds like a name mixed with the voices of the dead.  
So he let it go.  
Or at least, told himself he did.

His nephew visited again.  
Ten years old. A voice with a question mark at the end of every sentence.  
Hero sticker book in hand.

“Uncle, you were a hero once, right?”  
“...Yeah.”  
“Green Lantern, right? With the green laser and flying through space?”  
“That’s just the movies. I was just a guy who commuted to work in space.”  
“But the guy in the movie looked like you! The helmet was cool, and the effects were awesome!”

John didn’t laugh.  
That laughter stayed behind,  
on a day when someone died.

His nephew kept talking. John nodded and listened.  
The popcorn was cold.  
The movie was terrible.  
Onscreen, Green Lantern flailed inside bad dialogue and worse CGI.  
John didn’t sigh.  
He didn’t scoff.

His ring stayed quiet the whole time.  
Like it was hiding itself.  
Like it didn’t belong in the same scene.

That night, after the film,  
John sat on a bench outside the theater.  
His nephew was asleep.  
The stars were faint.  
The air was thick.

“You’re still here, huh.”  
He said it aloud.  
To someone.  
Or maybe to no one.

He slid the ring back into his pocket.  
No light.

But far off, somewhere in the sky—  
a small, faint green flicker.

He felt it at his back.

“Even names believed to be gone…  
sometimes prepare to be spoken again.”

 

**EPISODE 2 —** ***The Ring Did Not Respond***

John woke up like always.  
Made coffee.  
Turned on the radio.  
The DJ was mid-sentence about someone else’s heroic story—  
and then the ads came in.

John sipped slowly.  
There were still traces of battle in his hands.  
The wounds had healed, but the pressure of that day…  
still lingered in every joint.

His nephew was already awake.  
He sat on the kitchen floor with his sticker book,  
creating a new page.

“Uncle Hero John! I’ll give you your own page.”

John didn’t smile.  
Just took another sip.

“Why don’t you wear the ring anymore?”

He paused.  
Lowered his gaze.  
Opened his pocket.

The ring was still there.  
Unlit.

His nephew’s face lit up.

“Try it! Maybe today it’ll respond!”

John hesitated—  
and then slipped the ring onto his finger.

Silence.  
Nothing.

He didn’t laugh.  
Didn’t get angry.  
Just lowered his head.

“...Not today.”

“Then maybe tomorrow?”

“...I don’t know.”

That night, on the edge of the city,  
a small explosion lit the air.

An illegal experiment site—  
a waste disposal facility on the outskirts.

No civilians nearby, but one technician inside was hurt.

John didn’t hesitate.  
He ran in.

He shoved aside a collapsing metal beam with his shoulder.  
Cleared shattered glass with his bare hands.

He bled.

And in that moment, he realized:  
even without the ring,  
he *still moved*.

The technician asked,  
“Are you… a hero?”

John replied,  
“No. I just… had to help.”

Back home, John washed his hands.  
Then looked at the ring again.

“You saw that, didn’t you? Still no reaction.”

It didn’t shine.  
Still metal.

But this time,  
John didn’t smile either.

He looked in the mirror.  
At his hands that pulled someone free.  
At his body that still moved.  
At the back of the man who had jumped in.

He said quietly:

“Even a ring without light...  
a hand that moves isn’t a lie.”

 

**EPISODE 3 —** ***The Fallen Comrade***

John visited the outskirts of an old military base.  
There was no reason.  
No one invited him.  
No one was waiting.

It was just…  
the smell of sand soaked with sweat—  
lately, it kept drifting back into his memory.

He stood outside the fence, staring at the buildings.  
The place had been turned into a tech support center.  
The original headquarters—long gone.

The room where they used to sleep was repainted.  
The old cafeteria—signless, gutted.

Then, a voice behind him:

“Is that really… John Stewart?”

A low voice.  
Boots, worn with time.

John turned.  
It was Sergeant Casey.

A comrade.  
Someone who’d been through a few hells with him.  
Someone who almost died with him.  
Someone who hadn’t made it to the end.

Casey smiled.

“A legend from the movies, huh? Didn’t think I’d see you in a real theater.”

John smiled too.  
His smile held fatigue and a quiet helplessness.

At a rundown bar nearby, the two clinked their beers.

Casey asked,  
“You still got the ring?”

John nodded.  
“Still have it. Can’t use it, though.”

“Why not?”

“Don’t know.  
Maybe it’s me.  
Maybe it’s the universe.  
Maybe the ring didn’t reject me—  
Maybe *I* rejected the call.”

Casey fell silent for a moment.  
Then said:

“You always carried too much guilt.  
But John—  
we survived because we didn’t die.  
That’s it.  
That’s enough.”

John set his glass down.  
A faint impression of the ring was still on his finger.

It didn’t feel foreign.  
It didn’t define him.  
But he hadn’t erased it either.

That night, John stepped into his nephew’s room.  
The boy was asleep.  
The sticker book still lay beside the bed.

A new page had been added:

**“Heroes don’t have to shine.**  
**They just have to come back.”**

John stared at it for a long time.  
Then quietly turned off the light and walked out.

“The past always follows.  
But getting caught by it… is a choice.”

My dad's Tesla turns smoothly off the motorway and our surroundings soon become more and more rural, as we drive past field after field. Trees and hedges become a pleasant green blur outside my window on the faster roads; they are so narrow in comparison to the roads I was used to.    
  
Another turn reveals an expanse of rolling green hills and acres of trees under the sunny September sky. This was definitely the most green I'd seen in years and I was very excited by it.   
  
...  
  
Before I go any further, I should probably introduce myself.   
  
My name is Eliana Reva, but I much prefer to be called Ella because that sounds less like a character from a Lord of the Rings book. As Ella I tend to fit in more and as a classic textbook definition of an introvert that's all I've ever really wanted when I've been at school.  
  
For years I have attended boarding school in London where I currently reside with my parents. My parents work in the city but often have to travel all around the world to various cities, for an international law firm as human rights lawyers.   
  
When I was much younger, we used to live in a small village in the county of Hampshire along the south coast of England, before my parents relocated us to London because of their jobs. London had been an incredible place to live and I was very fond of it. I was never bored in London as there was always an abundance of things to do, but as I got older, it felt more and more like something was missing. I felt a little off balance, like...I wasn't where I was supposed to be. During the last year I had grown very tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, the noise, the endless pavements and the daily chaos of the London underground.   
  
I wanted to be somewhere more rural.   
  
Scratch that, I needed to be somewhere more rural; I felt like I was being called back to where I was born.   
  
I began to feel suffocated in the city and I made the decision to return to my home county in the countryside. I just kept dreaming of green fields, lush grass, huge willow trees and all sorts of wildlife and colourful exotic flowers. It was time to say goodbye to London, during term time, at least.  
  
My parents were more than happy for me to do my sixth form years at another boarding school since they were out of the country so often. They just wanted me to be happy.  
  
I had looked at numerous boarding schools, but a school called Exton College kept snagging my attention. I kept coming back to it's website; featuring an assortment of various beautiful people on it's front page just like the other schools did. But the people on the front page of theirs looked so alive, so happy and I wanted to be one of those happy people.   
  
Their marketing sure got me good.   
  
It had an excellent reputation for science among others and that was incredibly attractive to me as my goal was to apply to study medicine and become a doctor. I valued life and I wanted to make a difference to others with mine. I worked hard and had great grades, even though this was very counterproductive to my vague attempts at a social life. I had maybe one actual friend at my old school and we hadn't even kept in touch during the summer.  
  
All in all, I was quite happy to start fresh somewhere else. A clean slate; not that clean was anything I needed. I had led a fairly boring life at my last school.   
  
But...  
  
...this isn't a boring story, not by a long shot. If anything the next two weeks, the next six months even...well...there was no way I could've predicted anything that lay ahead for me as I innocently sat in the car on our way to my new school.   
  
...  
  
""Two minutes away sweetheart,"" Dad says quietly, checking the sat nav on the dashboard.  
  
I take a deep breath in and sit up a little more in my seat, a nervous anticipation was definitely setting in as my dad turns the car through an imposing set of wrought iron gates that leads down a long road lined with lush poplar trees.   
  
Even the driveway here looked posh. I vaguely remembered the photos of the school from their website and brochure but it looked more impressive in person. The school looked pretty well maintained, to say the least.  
  
We pass a large navy coloured sign which reads 'Welcome to Exton College'; its ivy and wolf's head emblem shining in gold.   
  
'Headmaster: Orion Landry' it says in a smaller font underneath. I remember the brief about the school that the headmaster had written for the school's website and I recall the photo of him. He had given me serious Dumbledore vibes, but I couldn't decide if it was the foot long white beard he had or his kind green eyes full of wisdom that leapt out from the photo. I had never before seen eyes that green. He definitely looked too old to be running a school, but I couldn't argue that he looked exactly like what I'd expect from the Headmaster of a very distinguished school.  
  
Presently, dad pulls the car into an unmarked parking spot in a large gravelled car park.  
  
""Well...this is it,"" he says, letting out a long whistle as he cranes his neck to look through the windscreen, up at the vast building in front of us.  
  
""This looks very different to my last school, that's for sure,"" I comment quietly. My last school could only have been described as a grey, concrete box, the only source of life being a solitary yew tree in the main courtyard.  
  
I get out of the car, more than keen to stretch my legs after the long journey. I hold my hand up to shield my eyes as I take in the imposing sight before me.   
  
A grand, red and beige bricked building stands before us. It has four main turrets around the front section and the tall windows make it look very distinguished. There are a large set of thick oak doors which sit proudly in the middle of the main building, flanked by pure white marble pillars. Ivy has snaked its way up the walls all around the building and around the large arched windows in particular which added to the grand mystique of the place. Back in London my schools were in a variety of different buildings, but nothing living snaked its way up the walls...or anywhere nearby for that matter.   
  
Dad opens the trunk of the car and pulls out my suitcases while I fumble around in my satchel for the bundle of paperwork I had been sent a few weeks ago.   
  
An SUV and another Tesla arrive in the car park to drop other students off just as we ascend the steps and enter the school through the large oak doors, finding ourselves in a grand atrium.   
  
I gasp.   
  
It is huge and the decor is rather decadent. It reminds me of the typical entrances they have in the posh hotels back in London.  
  
I immediately can't help but notice the grand staircase at the back. A beautiful and thick, rich, navy coloured carpet snakes all the way up the stairs to the first floor. The flooring of the atrium is a highly polished light hard wood that leads to baroque style walls. The biggest feature was a huge, gilded painting of a bizarrely pure golden wolf which adorned the wall at the back of the staircase. The painting was at least ten by twelve feet wide. The wolf had familiar piercing green eyes and was stood proudly on a hill top overlooking a forest and a vast meadow. It was beautiful, and I wondered where wolves fit into the history of the school considering they were also part of the school's logo. Above the bottom of the staircase was a beautiful and rather sizable chandelier with hundreds of glittering lights. The ceiling itself was ornate too.   
  
I immediately feel rather overwhelmed by the beauty and grandeur of this place and I inhale sharply as I take it all in.  
  
This looked nothing like how I imagined a school to look, it was very impressive...but I wasn't. Was I going to fit in here?  
  
My reverie was broken by a woman calling out from the side of the atrium.  
  
""Hello there! Good afternoon! You must be new to the college?"" a woman calls to us from behind a large reception desk to our left. I turned to face the woman, who has dark hair framing her plump and homely face. I step forward apprehensively toward the desk.   
  
""Hi. Yes...I...I'm new,"" I smile nervously. She smiles back at me warmly which relaxes me a little, and she gestures for me to come over.  
  
""Well, head on over here honey and lets go through the paperwork. Then we will get your room key and welcome pack sorted,"" she says, putting her glasses on from around her neck.   
  
""I'll do it,"" Dad offers happily, taking the paperwork from me and heading over to the receptionist himself while I walk further into the atrium. To the right of the stair case was a large set of comfortable looking navy blue sofas arranged around a circular oak coffee table.   
  
Along the wall behind the sofa arrangement is a wide notice board split into 'secondary' and 'sixth form' sections, along with a few vending machines located a little further away near one of several corridors off the atrium.   
  
This was definitely not a small school.  
  
Exton College was a sixth form, therefore students could attend the secondary school as normal from the age of eleven up until they reached sixteen. They could then continue their college level studies up until the age of eighteen. Or, there could be people like me, joining for the final two years of sixth form after leaving a normal secondary school.   
  
I walk over and take a closer look at what was on the sixth form notice board. There was a basic list of events listed for the coming academic year.  
  
Winter Formal - November 19th  
  
...  
  
Sixth form ski trip to Chamonix - February 18th  
  
...   
  
Spring Formal - April 4th  
  
I make a mental note to sign up for the ski trip. It was one of the most exhilarating things to do and I simply loved it. I'd gone almost every winter with my parents for as long as I could remember...but we unfortunately weren't going this year as my parents were going to be in California for several months.  
  
""Come on then Els, let's go find your new room,"" Dad says eagerly from behind me, having now finished exchanging forms and receiving various items from the lady on reception. I grab the handle of one of my suitcases and head to the lift to the side of reception rather than take the staircase.   
  
After following some signs for the 'ladies residential wing' we find room 2.06; my room for the next two years.   
  
""...and here...we...go..."", mutters Dad, slotting my new keycard into the security slot by the door. We open the door and step across the threshold. I am quite surprised at how large the room is. I am also surprised to see only two beds, having been in a dormitory with five other girls for the last few years.  
  
Two double beds flank either side of the room along the back wall, with an ensuite to the right and a sizable study area to the left. At the foot of both beds are large oak trunks and along the wall are oak wardrobes. Each wardrobe features a full length mirror in one of the doors. The decor of this room was in stark contrast to the grandeur of the atrium. Plain white walls, oak furniture and a dark grey carpet; more modern and simple compared to the grandiose appearance of the atrium.  
  
The main source of colour in the room comes from a dark pink floral duvet topped with a fluffy cream bedspread that is already on one of the beds. I definitely had a roommate, but she wasn't here right now. I notice a few photos stuck around the mirror on the associated wardrobe, mainly featuring a rather stunning girl with long, wavy, dark brown hair and another pair of startlingly green eyes. She was surrounded by the same people in every photo and I feel a little overwhelmed again, wondering what my roommate was going to be like. She clearly had an established life here at this school. Would she even like me? The girls in my dormitory didn't care much about me and I'd lived with them for five years.  
  
I notice the lack of any other personal effects and this tells me she probably hasn't returned just yet. Maybe she could show me around, at least?  
  
Dad checks his watch and sighs a little.  
  
""I'm so sorry honey, but I really can't stay too much longer, your mum and I have that flight to catch. Now....are you definitely sure that this is what you want? No travelling tutor? You could still come along with us?"" he says, holding both my upper arms and looking at me quite seriously in the face.   
  
I'm not sure. But I just need to be here.  
  
I smile at him, for I am used to this verbal exchange as we had done it every September for the past ten years. But something about this place is giving me a great feeling of trepidation among other things that I had certainly not felt at any of my other schools. For once it just felt like I had come to the right place and this was exactly where I needed to be.  
  
I nod sincerely.   
  
""Honestly Dad, I am really excited. This was a good decision for me. Besides, I'll see you both at Christmas, then again at Easter, and we will all be so busy anyway that time is going to go so quickly,"" I reassure him. He smiles warmly in response and pulls me into a big hug before giving me a kiss on my forehead. Then, with his hands on my shoulders once more, he studies my face.   
  
""Well...don't forget we are always just a phone call away...or maybe an email when you factor in the time difference. Only call it you really have to,"" he jokes. I laugh and nod.   
  
""Have a safe journey home, dad. Also a safe flight, of course. Honestly, please don't worry about me, I am going to be just fine.""  
  
He hugs me tightly once again before exiting the room. The door clicks shut and that's it; I am on my own.   
  
I sit on the edge of my new bed for a moment and breathe through the nerves I'd hidden from my dad. It was hard starting somewhere new, but I knew I just had to embrace it and power through it, because that was what I did.  
  
I go over to the large window at the back of the room in between the two beds and I look out across the grounds. They are vast, green and lush, just like I had wanted. I can see several other buildings separate from this one; this campus really was quite large.  
  
The closest I had to this back home was Regents Park. I carefully open the window and take a deep breath in, enjoying the invigorating feeling of the warm, late summer air entering my lungs. Looking out at the beaming sunshine I soon feel wide awake, my nerves disappearing as excitement starts to set in again.   
  
It was only half past four so there was still some time before dinner. I look at the site map I'd been given which had the meal times and other items of information anyone new to the school would need to know. The school was actually huge. I wonder how long it will take me to find my way around.  
  
I go back over to my side of the room and begin unpacking my things, wondering when my roommate was going to arrive. Mostly, I wondered exactly what she was going to be like...  
  


# My Roommate

\*\*\*Freya\*\*\*  
  
My brother performs yet another sharp turn as he drives his car through the gates of the school grounds, speeding hastily down the poplar lined driveway toward the car park.   
  
""This has definitely beat Stephen dropping us off, surely?"" my brother Austin says as he deftly swings the car perfectly into a parking spot in the student car park. I exhale with relief as the car stops with a sudden jolt.   
  
We had made it.   
  
""Yeah. I just love feeling car sick while you see local speed limits as a general guideline,"" I say with a hefty amount of sarcasm. I am just thankful we have made it back to school alive. Austin laughs heartily at my reaction. Typical.  
  
He'd passed his test six months ago but he still hadn't quite moved out of the standard teenage 'rally driver' phase. He drove fast and I was very thankful he had near perfect reflexes or else we'd have ended up in a hedge somewhere well before we'd gotten anywhere near Exton.   
  
I look over at him with an exaggerated scowl as he turns towards me and I tut loudly. He had the same thick, dark wavy hair just like me and we had the same piercing green eyes everyone in our family have always had. We also have the same generous dark eyebrows, except mine were kept very well groomed whereas his were perhaps a little on the wild side. He had grown a few inches over the summer and was now a gangly six foot two inches, while I was a rather respectable five foot nine, which was considered tall for a woman, particularly someone my age. I had only turned sixteen in June; I was annoyingly one of the babies of the year and I really hated that. We looked the same age, but there was only seventeen months between us and this was probably why we got on so well.   
  
The adrenaline rush from his hazardous driving aside, I adored my brother and generally so did everyone else who met him. He was easily the most liked person in school, a fact he had always seemed entirely oblivious to which only made people like him more.  
  
""Ouch, Freya,"" he says with mock sadness, ""I will remember this when Stephen starts teaching you in the summer and you start to enjoy the freedom that driving brings,"" he says, flashing me his classic cheeky smile. I smile back at him and he chuckles! he's got away with it once again.  
  
We both get out of the car and he starts taking my various belongings out of the car boot. He just has a single backpack. I wasn't sure how he was going to survive the school year on one backpack of clothes when he'd grown half a foot over the summer. Austin was useless when it came to having clothes that fitted. He also had a penchant for destroying clothes almost every time he shifted, so that backpack of clothes wasn't going to last long at all. Perhaps a fortnight.  
  
If you're new around here, you may be wondering what I mean when I say 'shifted'. Austin and I weren't typical teenagers, or at least, we were not like the majority of the human teenagers in the country. There was still definitely plenty of us. Well over two hundred thousand across the country alone...but the human population was entirely oblivious to us and for thousands of years it had been kept that way.  
  
We looked human, but we weren't. Not technically...and definitely not at night under a full moon.  
  
We were Lycan.   
  
We'd been called many things over the years, particularly 'werewolves', which was a mythological creature in pop culture. Definitely moreso thanks to the Underworld film franchise, Teen Wolf, Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. We weren't exactly like how they portrayed us. We hadn't been cursed or bitten, it was in our blood and written into our genetic makeup. We lived in packs across the entire world, much like normal wolves did. Lycans were however, much bigger than normal wolves and the key difference of course was that we were both human and wolf in one person. From the first full moon at the full onset of puberty we could shift into our wolf's form, taking on the appearance of the wolf spirit we became blended with, gifted to us by our Moon Goddess. We were blended with them for life. A best friend, an advisor, a partner in crime who would walk with us until our dying day, and then maybe...maybe we'd become a spirit ourselves one day and basically live on within someone else.  
  
Here we are, back at our home away from home, I said inwardly to my wolf spirit Mira.  
  
Hopefully your grandfather has sorted out the roommate issue from last year. Although a room to ourselves might not be so bad...I mean really, it's time for you to start mingling with the boys, Mira muses.  
  
I shuddered at the thought of my roommate from last year.  
  
Can't be any worse than an insane witch, right? I joke.  
  
Maybe we will be blessed with a nice simple human or something...if we have to have one at all, Mira suggests.  
  
I stare up at the grand building I knew and loved so much. I had been coming here as a student since I was eleven, but I had come here many times ever since I was very young; because this school was our family's legacy.   
  
It wasn't a normal school like hundreds of others across the country. It was a school mainly for the supernatural, governed for hundreds of years by our family. Our family also led our pack, which was the oldest and amongst the largest packs in the United Kingdom. Our father Leo Landry was the alpha in charge of our pack.  
  
I pick my things up, effortlessly. Wolf strength came in handy for moments like this, but most especially when it came to a heavy day of clothes shopping, something I'd not done in so long; which by my standards was roughly only two weeks...  
  
I walk through the big oak doors and flash a warm smile to Lynda, who manned Exton's reception desk.  
  
""Welcome back you two,"" she says, before turning a little to rummage in a tray of paperwork.   
  
""My my, haven't you both grown over the summer,"" she then says toward the both of us, ""you are becoming so handsome, Austin! You must be beating all the girls away with a tree trunk!""  
  
She slides our timetables and room key cards across the reception desk toward us as I roll my eyes a little.   
  
Austin had grown considerably over the summer and his baby fat days were definitely now far behind him. As such, there had been a lot more comments about his good looks, particularly from the other girls in the pack over the summer. I didn't mind it too much from Lynda, though, as she was something like a surrogate aunt to us while we were here at the school, and her comments were more maternal than anything else.  
  
""Very kind of you to point that out Lynda. I hope you had a great summer,"" I say a little sarcastically, grabbing both items.  
  
""I am loving the new hair cut on you Lynda, it really suits you,"" Austin says with a broad smile before following me towards the stairs. Oh for heaven's sake...  
  
Turning the charm on as always. Get used to it, though, it's just going to get worse when he hits eighteen in a few months, Mira growls in amusement.   
  
She knew how annoying I had found the fawning comments about him over the summer. Admittedly it was probably because no one ever made about me, but that was the life living in the shadow of our next pack alpha.  
  
We both throw our usual respectful nod toward the golden wolf on the giant painting on the back wall. The painting was many hundreds of years old and supposedly featured our pack's founder.   
  
The Landry bloodline was indeed very old, and very well respected. Our pack, the Golden Lycans, was the third largest in the country, and our name uniquely comes from a legend, rather than the area from which we originate. We descended from one of the original Lycans within this country and legend said he had fur of pure gold...soft to touch, and yet entirely impenetrable like armour. Supposedly, he had been impervious to fire and had been impossible to kill; but it was just a fancy story to explain our strange name, in my mind. Lycans only came in greyscale and browns.

I got him a good few months ago, where he was healthy with lots and lots of leaves. I had bought him at a local coffee shop that only had the name of the plant and the price, so no other accompanying information.
I have really struggled with my mental health, which affects my memory and motivation, which is how he has gotten to this sad state. I don't have a very consistent watering schedule, so I would just water him when he drooped, but I left for a trip and forgot to water him, and it has been a crazy uphill battle since to keep him alive(?). I previously lived in a decently shaded dorm, but now my only living option is in a sunroom (I will be getting blackout and sheer curtains when I can afford it) so I am not completely sure how I should handle his sunlight needs. I think his leaves are burned maybe?
This also might be a good time to mention that I have only ever owned two plants, him and a marbled queen pothos named Queenie. Queenie was also in poor shape when I returned, but I've finally found the balance that she needs, and she's sprouting so many leaves, it's so exciting!
Anyways, to summarize, I am at a complete loss for what to do with Jerry. I'm terrified to do anything with him because I really don't want him to die, but he's in such a pitiful state I cannot handle it anymore. Please help!",3,1746776049.0,plantclinic,8,1.0,False

Why is that? I was thinking about simply enlarging/drilling the pinhole in a normal basked, effectively removing the pressure limiter and transforming it into a non-pressurised basket. The total height wouldn't change!

Since I already use around 7-8 g coffee for a single shot, the non-pressurised basket should not require a larger inner volume either.

I'm new to this subreddit and like the title, I'm looking for some advices on weight loss.

I've been stuck for around 100kg (220lbs) for now 5 years.
I've been trying everything :
- Calorie deficit
- Fasting
- Walking out
- Limiting my plate
- Drinking more water, teas, etc

For context : I'm a 24 female, work in an office from 7 to 5pm, I don't move a lot since I started my new job but I still try to hit my 10k steps every day by walking around the area. I try to avoid unhealthy food and snacks but can't pick my diner at night since I live with my family. In the morning I drink my mandatory milk coffee and for lunch I either pack some leftovers from last night or I go to the store nearby to buy something cheap and easy to eat (usually ramen).

For now my family noticed physical changes but I can't see them and even worse, my balance still doesn't changes anything.

I've been wondering, should I invest on a dietician? Gym subscription ? or just push further more into my program ?
I'm scared I might go overboard and end up injuring myself or tire myself out of starvation.

BOOK ONE: FLAMES OF LOVE

January, 2018

Jaxson Anderson pushed the plate-glass door open, the overhead bell tinkling, announcing his entrance. The warmth, the yeast and sugar smell...it rushed over him, surrounding him, and he almost stopped dead in his tracks, wanting to do nothing but breathe it all in. He hadn't been in an honest-to-God bakery in ages, and had forgotten how damn delicious they smelled.

Before he could make a real ass out of himself by literally drooling just from the smell alone, though, a head popped up from behind the front counter. A cute brunette, her hair in a braid flopped over her shoulder, shot him a smile. ""Welcome to the Muffin Man,"" she called out, pushing some stray tendrils out of her face with the back of her hand. ""You been in here before?""

He'd hardly been in the town of Sawyer more than a couple of hours. ""Nope, first time here,"" he said as he walked closer to the front display case, and the adorable brunette behind it. She looked a little younger than him, with wide, innocent eyes that made her appear even younger as she peered up at him.

She was this tiny little thing that he was sure he could tuck under his arm and run with down the football field. Between her tiny stature and her wide eyes, she gave off the impression that she was twelve.

Except...he gulped. Those curves. No 12-year-old girl had those curves.

""Well then, an extra welcome!"" she said, sending him another dizzying smile. ""I'm glad you stopped by. Are you a...tourist?"" She looked a little puzzled at that idea, giving him a quick up-and-down glance.

No, he probably didn't look a damn thing like a tourist. Most fire chiefs didn't.

""Just new in town,"" he told her. ""What is good he - Sugar?!"" he said. He was staring straight at her delectable chest.

Which was probably not his best move. He knew he was being rude, but hey, she was the one who'd pinned her name tag on it. ""Your name is Sugar?!""

She rolled her eyes at him, which now that he was close enough, he could see they were a deep brown color. Like the color of the chocolate cake sitting in the display case between them. ""Don't bother making a joke,"" she told him pertly. ""I've heard every one of them that is funny, and a whole lot that aren't. I promise you, you won't be original.""

He leaned on the clear glass goodies counter, content for a moment to ignore the copious amounts of sugar underneath his arms, and instead focus on the Sugar in front of him. ""So...basically, your parents hated you.""

""Pretty much!"" she said cheerfully, shooting him a laughing grin. Right then, a guy came through the swinging doors from the back, and Jaxson nodded towards him.

""Is his name Flour?"" he asked dryly.

""No, but I like how you think!"" Sugar looked over at her co-worker and laughed. ""Gage, he thinks you ought to change your name to Flour!""

Gage looked up from off-loading a batch of muffins into a side display case. ""Hey, my parents didn't hate me,"" he drawled in a deep voice, proving that he'd overheard their discussion. ""Don't drag me into this.""

""I think I'm gonna start calling you Muffin,"" Sugar mused, shooting her co-worker a grin. ""Or maybe Baby Cakes.""

Gage rolled his eyes. ""That's just what this town needs to hear,"" he grumbled and disappeared into the back, carrying his empty tray with him.

""Woke up on the wrong side of the bed,"" Sugar said in way of explanation, complete with a shrug, as she turned back to Jaxson. ""So, what can I get for you? Coffee? Donuts? A...muffin, perhaps?"" Her voice was a little too innocent.

Jaxson's eyes shot up to hers. Was she teasing?

Her eyes were glinting with mischief. She was.

""I was thinking that I might be in the mood for some baby cakes,"" he said, his tone as innocent as hers. She burst out laughing.

""I think I like you,"" she said, shooting him a wide grin after she caught her breath.

""You'd like me even more if I had some coffee and a donut in me,"" he informed her. ""I'm a lot more fun to be around when I'm awake.""

""Even more fun?"" she echoed, wrinkling her nose as she turned to grab a to-go cup. ""Damn. I'm not sure if I can handle that much fun. Maybe I shouldn't get your coffee after all.""

""Never come between a man and his coffee,"" he intoned, only three-quarters joking.

More like half, really.

""Fair enough,"" she said, filling the cup from the dispenser. Tendrils of steam encircled her hand and then melted away. ""So what brings you to Sawyer, if you're not a tourist?""

She turned back around, deftly grabbing a lid and pushing it into place even as she was sliding the cup across the counter to him.",1,1746775665.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

For the past year, I’ve been buried in academic operations, admissions, onboarding, sending reminder emails, coordinating with faculty, manually updating sheets, chasing application statuses... the whole circus. I used to joke that my job title was basically ""firefighter"" because every day felt like putting out fires.

I’d wake up to chaos. 37 emails. 12 unread WhatsApps from professors. 4 missed deadlines I didn’t even know existed. I couldn’t breathe. It was exhausting.

Then, a month ago, a colleague from another university just casually mentioned a tool they were trying. Said something like, “It saved my semester.” I was skeptical. I’ve tried tools before. They either overpromise, underdeliver or make you feel like you need a PhD just to operate the dashboard.

But this one… quietly changed everything.

I don’t want to sound like a billboard here (mods pls don’t ban me 😅), but this platform brought together everything I needed:

* It shows me what’s happening in real time
* Students stop slipping through the cracks
* Faculty actually respond because THEY get reminders too
* I’m no longer syncing 3 CRMs and 20 Google Sheets

If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even more recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion.

I've actually found a Pepe fudder from way before it really took off, and if this account shown in the links below held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth.

[https:\/\/x.com\/AltcoinDailyio\/status\/1654893606292062209](https://preview.redd.it/z26qcrf0kpze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fdb6f85638564bb45ecff718bb6e3736c5324f9)



What this means is you never want to pay attention to anything people are saying about something (yes I know this is kind of contradictory to this whole post but stay with me here). Even if someone says that Kendu is cooked or whatever, just do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now (which we've just broken out of today, see: [legendary comeback on the charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1khjdkl/kendu_just_brokeout_nothing_is_stopping_this_now/)) but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to a little lower from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot straight back up to 50-100 milly, which is probably what is going to happen from here seeing the massive reversal in the wider market today.

Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

Look at the past Shiba Inu profit chart from release to ATH's:

[shib chart before and after mooning](https://preview.redd.it/szohe1b2kpze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1bd1b508b29632d09f3ee10ae70a8b4aeee6a9)

  
And what is KENDU you may ask? Well let me explain...

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

Was using a budget pump machine before, kind of like the DeLonghi Dedica, just under a different brand name and slightly different look sold in half the price of a Dedica from where I'm at. The shots were pretty OK with it once I dialed in and I was shaky if I should pull the trigger on the Robot for better coffee since people say it's so good, and in some way I just can't help but think there are still improvements on the taste of my shots.  
I couldn't try the Robot because people that I know doesn't have this machine or even aren't into espresso. All I have for reference are the videos on YouTube and threads on Reddit. I finally decided to give it a shot and for someone who's reading this content I highly recommend it!  
It's a huge step up and I was only told the Robot's good...but I didn't expect it to be THIS good.

Also to share my recipe: I do an pre-infusion for around 10sec at 2bar, then go full strength to hit around 7-8bars till the end of extraction. My grinder is 1zpresso K-ultra and the grind setting is at 3.1. The outcome is outstanding for my own taste. This recipe is also used in the clip I posted and the shot timing is around 30 sec. But depending on different beans, under the same grind setting the extraction time varies. I'm just using same grind setting because it's kind of tiring to dial in and another huge benefit I find on the Robot is it seems to be very forgiving. The extraction time can sometimes take as long as around 45sec but still tastes good and not over extracted, I tasted no bitterness.

I really have great experience on this machine and it produces great tasting coffee, I drink black coffee most of the time so the lack of producing milk drinks isn't really a downside for me. And if I really wanted a latte I could just head to the convenience store and get a cup.  
I guess for people wanting the Robot has already know it's advantages but I just hope people reading this or who's considering this machine, my humble experience could help making up your mind if you're at the position where I was once at or you are just simply considering getting this machine along instead of upgrading from another machine.

I’ve been reviewing bubble tea for the last 4 years and just wanted to share some of my top picks from each brand/general opinions! take note all of these are just my own opinions and generally i prefer milk tea + chewy toppings. Usually I’ll get milk tea + chewy topping or fruit tea with some sort of jelly / white pearls / konjac / aloe vera. I order everything 25% or 0% sugar, less ice.

Koi: Consistently decent but no longer that affordable
Fav drinks - Caramel Milk Tea, Honey Milk Tea, any milk tea tea base, grapefruit yakult (not sure if it’s still there)
Fav toppings - Golden Bubble, Taro Q (not sold at the moment), Chrysanthemum Chew Chew

Chicha: For tea lovers! Abit pricey but deserves its good reputation imho
Fav drinks - green tea / osmanthus oolong / black tea + cream + bubble, dong ding oolong fresh milk, mango osmanthus oolong, Sakura Oat Milk
Fav toppings - bubble, taro bubble, sakura konjac

Chagee: For tea lovers but no toppings. Usually get peach oolong milk tea or if not jasmine green milk tea

Beutea: Chagee but with toppings basically. Underrated

Playmade: Pretty good but pearl quality esp v inconsistent, average teas. Fav drinks: Burnt Caramel Milk Tea with Black Sesame Pearls, Osmanthus Oolong Milk Tea, Osmanthus Oolong Lemon Tea with Osmanthus Jelly. Fav toppings: Pink cactus pearls, black sesame pearls. 

Kamakura Warabimochi: I’m considering this bbt. It’s nice but v ex, just buy and try when on 50% off/when have promo. Strawberry Milk Warabimochi + Matcha Latte Warabimochi my favs

Heytea: Potential to be good but they keep removing all my favourites 😭 fruit cheezos were pretty good the last time I had them though, prob the best cheese foam out there

R&B Tea: Koi but slightly worse and significantly cheaper. Idk if they still sell but I rmb their Brown Sugar Boba Milk Cheese Brûlée being really good

Gongcha: Meh, for the price I’d rather get something else. Nicer overseas 

Liho: Also q meh but at least got some cheap options

iTea: Good fruit tea, skip the milk teas. Usually get the Peach Green Tea with White Pearl and Aloe Vera Passionfruit Green Tea

The Whale Tea: Underrated, pretty good tea quality in general from what I’ve tried and their honey pearls hit like crack 

Woobbee: my fav things from them are generally their flavoured milk teas, rest I might skip. honey mint milk tea, pipagao milk tea (this is rly good) and strawberry green milk tea my top picks

Attea: some decent options! got student promo also / occasional vouchers on Shopee or grab. Pink Meteor / Grapefruit Green Tea / Genmaicha Cane Roasted Milk Tea / Cane Roasted Milk Tea my top drinks, toppings I’d go with honey or oolong jelly

other brands I feel are worth a shot / got some decent drinks: Fruce, No.17 Tea, Hello Brew Bar (cheap n good milk tea n pearls), Kebuke, Silk, Big Short Coffee (not bubble tea but v fancy coffee I love it)

George begins to tell everyone at his job that he doesn't know Jerry Seinfeld and that he made up their friendship...,"George tells everyone that he made up their friendship because Jerry is famous as he takes down a picture of them together.  

Jerry can't sleep due to someone knocking on his door at 3am every morning and is afraid it's someone wanting to give him concrete shoes just like Jimmy Hoffa, especially since he's a Jets fan and not a fan of the Giants. 

Elaine begins following Newman secretly on his route to find out who the gangsters are but gets lost and eventually finds another mail carrier to ask for directions but it's a new mail carrier on the first day of his job so he accidently gives Elaine directions to an area of town where her tires are stolen after she walks into a coffee shop to use the bathroom. 

Kramer is in hiding but ran out of milk so he knocks on Jerry's door at 3am hoping that the gangsters are at home sleeping.  

Newman tells the gangsters that Jimmy Hoffas son told Jerry the joke at a party. The news reports that Jimmy Hoffas son has gone missing and the Giants begin digging up the end zones to find him but end up finding the body of real Giant. 

The gangster boss decides he really wants to quite being a gangster because he feels like he is too old and his right-hand is bothering him from counting money and word on the street is that Kramer is psychic and can tell the future so he goes to Kramers door at 3am to ask him privately what he should do. 

Kramer pulls out a box of marbles and throws them on the floor and pretends to read them. 

Jerry finally falls asleep after a week but is awakened by Kramer banging on his door at 330am to tell him that he told the gangster boss that if he quit his job and lets his past go he would become the mayor of NY thus saving Jerry's life. 

Jerry decides to go on vacation in the Bahamas and runs into Jimmy Hoffas son who is on a secret vacation with his mistress.

1kicf0p,https://i.redd.it/9kgxoiabhpze1.jpeg,London / lhr centurion lounge,"Quite disappointed with my experience - it was my first time actually using my plat to enter a centurion lounge and it left me let down. Will still be keeping the card as I can see the value as a financial product, but this particular selling point is not worth much IMO. 

The Heathrow centurion lounge is tucked away in what feels like the back rooms of the terminal. This part is kind of cool though, feels a bit like a secret club being so distinctly separate from the other lounges. You have to enter it through a (slow) lift and corridor. Walked in and was greeted at the front by staff - no complaints there, they were very friendly and smiley. 

However the lounge itself is what was the let down was. 

Firstly; the overcrowding problem is real. The place was full, and since it was mainly couches as opposed to individual armchairs it made it impossible to sit by myself. I could’ve squashed myself next to a stranger but meh, didn’t feel like it. Also because of this it was fairly loud. FWIW this was at 9am, maybe it’s quieter later?

Secondly; the food and drinks. Maybe I’ve been spoilt by other lounges but a buffet and (IMO this is the most egregious thing) MACHINE coffee was not what I was expecting. From a priority pass lounge, sure, but it was not my expectation of centurion, especially in a huge travel hub like London. As a side note, is Qantas an outlier with barista coffee in its lounges, or do other Amex lounges have baristas in them? I could just be expecting too much. 

Lastly; there were no windows, and by extent, no sunlight. This is a must have for a premium lounge.

I ended up circling around the lounge looking for a place to sit, saw the buffet / coffee machine but nothing appealed to me, so I left pretty quickly. Got a funny look from the Amex staff at the front who let me in as I had walked back out in probably under two minutes, but whatever.

Ended up going to the Qantas lounge instead where I ordered a porridge and my friend ordered a salt and pepper squid (pictured). Odd breakfast choice IMO but they did have actual chefs on hand to make both of our meals so I don’t fault him for it. Then we went to the lounges upper level with runway view and ordered some cappuccinos while enjoying the morning sun. 

Overall the centurion lounge is definitely better than nothing, but I’m not in a hurry to go back. It was disappointing to me as finally visiting a centurion lounge was something I’d wanted to try out for a while as there is very limited opportunity for me to do so from Australia, which is why I prioritised visiting over going straight to the Qantas lounge, but I think this program needs a rethink / revisit by corporate.

1kice5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1kice5z/desperate_on_my_job_search_15_years_of_looking/,Desperate on my job search; 1.5 years of looking for non profit/development/legal assistant roles?,"Hi all, I know this is a real shot in the dark but I’m running out of doors to knock, and I thought I’d try here just in case.

I spent 5 years as a paralegal assistant in Seattle, then did 2 years and 2 emergency humanitarian responses overseas with a UN agency, delivering food aid. I took external relations roles in the field, from partnerships (proposal writing, donor relations, mission planning, executive support) to communications (strategy, content collection and development, social media, narrative writing, editing, mission planning, event management). 

At the end of 2023, my contract was finished and I had to leave due to the political situation and regional issues.

I’ve been looking for a job in Seattle ever since. It’s been 1.5 years of applying now and I’ve found nothing. I’ve applied to hundreds and hundreds of jobs , through indeed, ziprecruiter, LinkedIn, company websites, etc. I’ve exhausted my network both locally and overseas looking for advice, coffee chats, introductions, etc. I’ve followed all the popular advice - reinvented my resume multiple times, found networking opportunities in person, polished my cv, watched a million videos on how to get my resume through ATS, etc. through all of this, I’ve only had a few responses, and even fewer interviews, which all resulted in the job posting being cancelled, or me being ghosted. 

I’m really running out of hope, patience, and savings. I moved back in with my parents because I can’t afford to live on my own. I know my resume is solid, and I have good experience, positive reviews, a great work ethic, and lots of interests. I know the job market is terrible, and the sector (foreign assistance) that I’ve been working in is being actively dismantled, but I need to find something. I’m becoming really desperate and I have no idea what more I’m supposed to do.

Originally I was looking for something in the nonprofit or development space or with the state but honestly I’m open to anything now. I have lots of good skills - admin, marketing, comms, writing, project and program management, donor relations, fundraising, social media, photography/videography, editing, etc. 

Does anyone have ANY advice or leads on specific job opportunities?! Maybe something is opening up in your company? Maybe there is a networking event you’d recommend? Or a staffing agency you’ve used and recommend? Anything, absolutely anything would be so so appreciated. Thank you 🙏🏼

1kicdqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kicdqb/dreamt_about_my_coworkerformer_fling/,Dreamt about my coworker/former fling,"So I (28M) bit the forbidden fruit and had a thing with my coworker (21F). I started working there last January and she had already been there for a year. We didn’t mat much attention to each other till the summer where her schedule changed bc of summer vacation and we were on shift a lot more together. I caught feelings for her but didn’t do much about it since I figured there was no chance, then one day we hooked up and started dating. 

Things didn’t go that well between us, I got super attached bc I really liked her and to her this was just a casual thing and she was kind of just going along with things since she knew how much I liked her. It got to a point where she had to break things off because she felt like she was under a lot of pressure and that my happiness was her responsibility and that’s a burden she didn’t want to carry. I’ve been torn up about it ever since and that happened back in January.

We haven’t spoken outside of work ever since and it’s been eating me alive because I still crave her attention and approval and just wish she would understand that I’m sorry this is how things turned out. She’s finishing college soon and will be gone at some point but today I noticed she removed me as a follower and also unfollowed me on Instagram, which tells me after all this time I’ve spent thinking about her the only way she’s thought of me is to remember that she wants to forget me.

Anyway, here’s the dream. I had it on Tuesday. I wrote it in my notes app the moment I woke and formatted it as if I was telling her about it so excuse the direct perspective.

Max and I were in my parking garage waiting for you to be done with something. He and I weren’t talking, just sitting in silence the way we normally do at work. I was actually laying in bed in my parking spot. When you started to approach, Max left me and I stayed in bed because I figured wherever you guys were going I couldn’t follow. I heard you ask Max about me and he pointed at me, at which point I waved at you. Maybe it’s because you wanted to check on me or make me feel included, but you came over to my bed, stood on a platform behind it, and suddenly started giving a 15 minute synopsis of your hour long lecture that you just had complete with a slideshow. You told me about your professor and pieces they’ve composed, then the lecture transitioned to a review of your personal experiences traveling abroad with your class. I saw footage of you on a ferry in a lake where silverfish were swimming alongside and jumping out of the water. You mentioned something about this special kind of coffee you had in Egypt that was terrible but you still have to try it when you’re there as part of the experience. And how getting wasted before the morning flight home from Amsterdam wasn’t the best idea but you’d do it again anyway. You spoke so clearly and quickly I was in awe just watching you even if I didn’t quite understand everything. When it was over I followed you to the door to walk you out. Max left first, and before the door shut you turned and approached me with such a determined walk and so much intensity in your eyes. I thought you were going to kiss me but instead you whispered to me that there’s something you can’t tell me just yet and to be patient. I said take your time, and you left. But just before you passed through the door you very casually said I love you, like you had said it a million times before; and I fell to my knees as the door shut behind you.",1,1746774317.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

1. I live in humid ass Brisbane Aus, its currently cooling down but thats not really saying much. And the wedding is at the end of May which will be autumn but again that is more of a concept here than a real season. For this reason, I want to know if cardboard cake board or plastic cakeboards would be better for warm and humid weather. In my head, plastic will slide around in the rapidly sweating butter cream and card would not, but if there are any floridians or vietnamese bakers who have tips for humid weather hmu.

  
2. I want to use my favourite mascapone buttercream recipe, but  I am also tempted to use it as filling inside of a firmer buttercream baorder and crumb/topcoat. If I can use the mascapone buttercream recipe for all of the frosting though I'd like to.

  
3. I have bought some white gum paste and won't be able to colour it as I cant knead it enough to blend the dye becuase of bad joints, and don't have aqua or powder food gel anyway, only colourmill oils. Can I use the colourmill oil based dyes and a bit of vodka to paint the gum flowers I will make from molds? If I can, is it best to dry the flowers first, or paint them and then let it dry and set for a few weeks?

So, I’m posting my full response here to give parents and prospective students a clearer idea about Sai University based on real experience.

Here’s the post I’m replying to:

R. Arjun Thilak

Academic Representative, SCDS (2023,2024)

Note: This response is written purely from my perspective as a student and is not influenced by any position I hold or by the university management.
I’m responding here to ensure the facts are represented accurately and to provide first hand insights. If anyone has any doubts or needs further details about the university, feel free to reach out to me directly. I’ll be happy to provide more information and clarify any misunderstandings.
Before addressing the points raised by so,called Mr.“Exposing_Truth007” let me first share a few things that are important (Academics , food , and hostel ) to me and that I appreciate most about Sai University, which I believe provide a clearer picture of the actual experience here.
Faculty and Research Culture:
I've been studying here for over three years, and I have never faced any problems academically. My learning experience at Sai University has been exceptional, and the faculty members are highly qualified and worth learning from. Some professors are true gems , I feel extremely fortunate to study under their guidance. They are open to research ideas, always listening to students, and encouraging collaboration. I can walk into their office anytime, and they always respond to my emails promptly. No professor has been rude or dismissed any suggestions from me or my classmates. They are always kind and supportive, and I’ve even had the opportunity to sit with professors until 9 PM to clear all my doubts.
Hostel and Food:
No university in South India, and perhaps in most of India, offers such top,tier accommodations and food. Initially, we stayed in a hostel called Gokulam Park for two to three months, followed by a stay at Ocean Drive Villas in ECR for another three semesters. Both places were premium, offering 2BHK villas for four boys, air conditioned, with daily cleaning services. After the university built its own hostel, the facilities continued to be outstanding. We have separate flats, either 2BHK or 3BHK, with attached bathrooms, a medium sized hall, a small kitchen, a balcony, a washing machine, and air conditioning.
The infrastructure at Sai University is better than most colleges in Chennai. The hostels are well equipped, and the transportation facilities are excellent , there are city buses to and from the campus every weekend. When it comes to food, the variety and nutritional value are unmatched. I exclusively eat the college food, and it fulfills all my dietary needs, including for those who work out. We get eggs for breakfast, plant based protein or paneer at lunch, and weekly chicken or egg for dinner. The food quality is excellent and meets all nutritional goals. If anyone doubts this, they can come to Sai U and have lunch with us , you’ll love it!
In short, the faculty, hostel, and food here are more than what you’d expect from a top,tier university in this region.

For point 1 
Yes, it is true that Sai University currently has two main academic buildings and one hostel block. We acknowledge this fact openly. However, it is important to understand the broader context before drawing harsh conclusions.
Sai University is a relatively new and emerging institution. It was not created to generate profit or to mislead students and parents. In fact, the Chancellor has personally donated his wealth to build this university from the ground up. The intent behind this institution has always been to create a world class learning environment , and while we are still on that journey, progress is evident.
Now coming to the concern about space: with approximately 350 students currently enrolled, the two buildings have been sufficient for academic activities, with at least three classrooms vacant during most hours of the day. The claim that 1,500 students are being admitted next year is a rumor, and nowhere has the management officially stated such a number. This assumption seems to be based on speculation rather than fact.
That said, the administration and faculty are just as , if not more , concerned about ensuring quality and comfort for the students. When a new batch was admitted last year, and accommodation was tight, the management responded by renting out an entire apartment complex in Kelambakkam to house the students comfortably. That shows their willingness to take timely action.
Yes, concerns exist. But the university is actively working on solutions. New infrastructure is part of the long term plan, and the process for expanding facilities is already underway.
Let’s hold the university accountable, yes , but also support it when it is genuinely trying to grow with integrity.
For Point 2 

Let’s take a breather and clear up what “international faculty” actually means , because clearly, there’s some confusion floating around. No, it doesn’t just mean someone with a foreign passport. In higher education, “international faculty” commonly refers to those who:
Have studied abroad, especially at the PhD or postdoctoral level.


Have worked in international institutions or been involved in global academic projects.


Bring internationally recognized academic standards and practices into Indian classrooms.


So yes, even if someone is Indian by birth, their international academic exposure still qualifies them as international faculty. This isn’t misleading , it’s the globally accepted norm in academic circles.
Now, based on the claims made by the so,called “exposingtruth007,” I can clearly conclude that either they’ve not done any research or simply have no prior understanding of what constitutes international academic experience , To clear up any misunderstandings, here are several real, present, and active faculty members at Sai University whose qualifications and academic backgrounds prove otherwise:

Dr. Ajith Abraham – PhD from Monash University, Australia and Master of Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
Dr. Subrata Dey – PhD from the University of Adelaide, Georgia State University and MA from wake forest University .


Dr. Ram Prasad K – PhD from Spain, Postdoc from Ireland, Director of VisionCog R&D


Prof. Subba Rao Toleti – Indo,German Postdoc, DSc in Biotechnology


Dr. Sindhuja Sankaran – PhD in Social Psychology from Cardiff University, UK


Siddhanth Prasad – Master’s from University of Cambridge, UK; also studied at NUS, Singapore


Prof. T S Gopi Rethinaraj – PhD in Nuclear Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana,Champaign


Prof. Saraswathi Krithivasan – PhD from IIT Bombay, MS from UMass Amherst


Zahida War – MSc from King’s College London, PGD from Ashoka University


Prof. Jamshed Bharucha – PhD from Harvard, former President of Cooper Union, USA


Prof. Sherman Teichman – Professor with significant U.S. education and experience


Additionally, visiting faculty from prestigious institutions have taught us valuable courses:
Prof. Madhavan Mukund – Director, Chennai Mathematical Institute (taught DBMS)


Dr. S. P. Suresh – PhD from IMSc; Faculty at CMI


Rajeeva Karandikar – PhD from ISI Calcutta, ex,Director of CMI


Murugeswari Issakkimuthu – Postdoc from CMI, University of Wyoming


Kavita Sutar – Northeastern University


Mousumi Dutta – IIT Kharagpur


Neha Prabhu – PhD from IISER Pune, former faculty at IIT Bombay
Moreover, Sai University also has some of the most skilled and knowledgeable faculty in their respective domains. For example, Prof. Ashok Chandrasekaran, who holds a PhD from Anna University, and Prof. Mariya Celin, with a Master of Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, are among the best when it comes to audio and speech technologies , both bring years of deep expertise and practical experience in these fields. And ,Prof. Ujjwal Verma, who completed his Master’s at IIT Palakkad, is known for his exceptional command over C programming and his strong foundation in mathematics, which is critical for both computer science and data science students.


Teaching Quality and Experience
On a personal note, I am pursuing a dual degree,one from IIT Madras (BS in Data Science and Applications) and another from Sai University (majoring in Computing and Data Science). While both institutions offer similar courses, my experience at Sai University has been exceptional. The academic support here,from professors and fellow students,has been unmatched.
I’ve had the privilege of working with renowned Tamil director Mysskin on his upcoming film Train in the IoT area, and I have secured over six topper badges in IIT Madras courses. With the guidance of professors like Ashok Chandrasekaran, I was able to publish a research paper in an IEEE conference on Quantum Machine Learning. I have also completed three internships during my first three years. While I had letters of recommendation from Sai University professors, I cleared all the interview rounds on my own, and I owe everything to the solid foundation and knowledge Sai University provided me.
It's not just about me,over 8 students have published research papers during their undergrad years. For all of this, no one helped me except Sai University. To secure good marks in IIT Madras subjects, I relied solely on the courses offered at Sai University and the teaching methods they provide, which helped me outperform others. The knowledge I gained at Sai, the rigorous academic environment, and the support from professors have played a crucial role in my growth, both academically and professionally. Whether preparing for internships or excelling in my studies, Sai University has been a significant contributor to my success.
In fact, I have found that the teaching methodology and faculty engagement at Sai University surpass those at many other institutions, including IIT Madras. The professors here are not only highly qualified but are also deeply committed to helping students with research, projects, and career guidance. Many students who specifically chose Sai University for its academic rigor can attest to the outstanding support we receive, which is often unmatched by other universities, including IITs or even NPTEL courses.
Sai University offers a rich and updated curriculum that focuses on practical application. Professors engage us in both theory and hands-on projects, enabling us to gain real world experience while we learn. The academic freedom and opportunities for research in emerging fields like AI, Advanced Speech Technology, Quantum Computing, and Data Science are far beyond what many top,tier institutions offer.
In conclusion, the faculty at Sai University, their qualifications, and their commitment to student development make Sai University stand out. I believe the educational experience here provides the best support for students focused on academic excellence and career growth.
For Point 3
This claim is simply not true and misrepresents the actual admissions process at Sai University.
From my own experience and that of many peers, Sai University follows a clear and structured admission process. When I applied, there was an interview stage that evaluated not just academic background, but also the student's interest, clarity of thought, and potential for growth. Additionally, merit based scholarships are awarded to students with strong academic records, proving that the university does recognize and reward quality.
It's important to clarify that holistic admission doesn't mean ""no standards"". It means evaluating a candidate beyond just marks,looking at their interests, potential, and ability to grow academically and professionally. This is a globally accepted practice used by top universities around the world.
Also, we’ve personally spoken to the university management about this concern. They clearly mentioned that there is no preference for quantity over quality. The goal is to maintain both diversity and academic strength,by admitting students who are not just academically capable, but who also bring different strengths to the table.
As for the language barrier argument, let me give a real example. One of my close friends is from Andhra Pradesh and studied in a regional board school. His English skills were initially weak, but his understanding of algorithms, data structures, and core computer science concepts is excellent. Despite his language limitations, he currently holds a CGPA of  9.5 (without relative grading) and is among the toppers in courses like DSA, DBMS, and Data Analytics & Visualization. He even cracked multiple internship interviews on his own by the end of his second year. English fluency is not the only indicator of ability or success,this student proves that talent and hard work go much further.
Sai University also supports such students through a collaborative environment where peer tutor learning, and accessible faculty(you can reach out to any faculty anytime ) this make everything easy 
In short, Sai University does not accept “anyone and everyone.” There is a proper admissions process in place, and many deserving, intelligent, and hardworking students are thriving here. The community is indeed diverse,not just in background but in goals and strengths. Like in any college, you will find students who are academically focused, some who are into sports or extracurriculars, and a few who are here just to get a degree. Since Sai U is a small and close, knit university, you might feel these differences more clearly. But this mix exists everywhere,even in large universities like SRM or VIT, where students also enter through management quotas. The difference is, that kind of management, seat culture doesn’t exist in Sai University. 

For Point 4
Yes, it's true that Sai University doesn't currently have a full,fledged canteen or juice shop on campus, and the food poisoning incident did happen. But let’s look at the full picture.
Last year, there was a third party vendor running a tuck shop inside the SaiU hostel serving burgers, sandwiches, chips, soft drinks, and ice cream. Unfortunately, the vendor failed to maintain basic hygiene, he didn’t replace old oil, eggs, and mayonnaise. This led to around six students falling sick due to food poisoning. The university immediately responded: the students were taken to the nearest hospital in Chettinadu  and were well cared for. Even Chancellor Ramani Sir personally visited the students to check on their condition.
The vendor was removed the very next day.
After that, SaiU tried setting up a new tuck shop in the basement, offering snacks, beverages, stationery, and basic daily use products. The university didn’t charge any rent, hoping to support the vendor. But due to the small student population at the time, the vendor couldn’t make enough revenue to continue operations, this is a common challenge for small or growing campuses.
That said, the management has confirmed that a new tuck shop will open next semester, now that the student strength is increasing, making it more viable for vendors.
As for the claim that students have to walk 5 km to find food or fruit shops, that is simply not true.
There are two local shops just 300 meters from campus, on both sides of the entrance, offering items like coffee, soft drinks, Maggi, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and daily use goods.


For fruits and groceries, Paiyanoor is just 2 km away, an easy walk with good scenery, and has shops, restaurants like Green Leaf, bakeries like Relax, and clean, hygienic food options.


For more variety, students can order from Vaaki Cafe through zomato with no delivery charge , which delivers to the hostel.


In fact, several student-run food services operate inside SaiU, offering meals and snacks with 30–45 min delivery. These are run by students, for students.


SaiU is still a young university, and like any new campus, it faces some logistical challenges .

For Point 5
Yes, the university's mental health counsellor did resign , but let’s look at what actually happened and why.
There was a very serious case where a student was experiencing severe suicidal thoughts. In situations like this, it becomes a matter of student safety, not just confidentiality. The university management, as a precaution, requested the counsellor to share only the names of students whose mental health risk was categorized as high, medium, or low , not any private conversations, therapy notes, or personal details shared during the sessions.
The management clearly stated that their intention was to be able to intervene early in high risk cases and inform parents only when necessary, especially if the student's safety was at immediate risk. They did not ask the counsellor to break any professional boundaries related to confidential conversations.
In fact, in the serious case mentioned, the student’s parents were informed out of genuine concern , not to “protect the university's reputation,” but to protect the student’s life. If something tragic were to happen on campus or in the hostel, legal responsibility falls on the institution. The police and authorities would demand answers, and in those moments, the university must act responsibly.
The counsellor, however, chose not to comply even with the request to share only the risk levels, which created a conflict. Due to this, she chose to resign.

For Point 6
Regarding placements , yes, it's true that the first batch has faced challenges, but let’s break down why that happened rather than just blaming the university.
First, the current final year batch is quite small. Among them, a majority were focused on going abroad for higher studies , this includes students from both SAS and SCDS. So the number of students who actively opted for placements was already very low.
The Career Services team did send job opportunities and encouraged students to apply. However, very few students actually applied, and even fewer were seriously preparing for these roles. Many preferred data science related positions, which are currently highly competitive and limited in the job market. Some companies did come for interviews, but since the number of applicants was low and performance in the interviews wasn't up to the mark, no one got selected.
Also, big companies usually prefer coming to campuses with large final year batches so they get a return on their effort , so yes, SaiU’s batch size made it harder to attract major recruiters.
That said, TCS was one company that did open applications and the career service had direct connections with them  (3–4 LPA for SAS and 3–9 LPA for SCDS). Only a handful applied (3 from SAS, 6 from SCDS), but unfortunately, no one cleared the screening test .
We fully acknowledge that SaiU didn’t provide enough placement training at the right time , this was partly due to not having a Vice Chancellor or Deputy VC during a critical period when planning was needed. The crash course that was offered later was too short and not very effective.
But here’s the positive part: the current DVC and VC have taken this feedback seriously, and there’s already a plan in place to start structured, semester,long placement training for the next batch , covering resumes, aptitude, technical rounds, and mock interviews.
So while the current situation isn’t perfect, improvements are being made, and the students still have opportunities , they just need to engage with them seriously.

For Point 7 
Let’s get the facts straight. The board members don’t just show up once a year. At SaiU, there's an open board meeting every 3 months, and they regularly interact with the Chancellor, leadership, and faculty to discuss university progress. Honestly, tell us, in how many top universities do board members visit this often and stay directly involved with internal matters?
Now, about the “waiter” comment , during events like convocation or high level meetings, students wear formal attire like blazers and ties. If that’s being called a “waiter’s outfit,” then by that logic, every senior executive in global companies would be a waiter too.
And yes, students sometimes help with welcoming guests or coordinating during events. That’s not “seva”; that’s professional exposure, event management, and hospitality , all of which are valuable skills. Many of us feel proud to interact with top leaders like Narayana Murthy and learn directly from them.
So if hosting guests respectfully and dressing professionally makes us “waiters,” then we’re proud to be the kind of waiters who are learning from the best .


For Point 8
Yes, sometimes semester transcripts or final results take time, but that’s not unique to SaiU; it's the case in many top universities across India, both large and small.
However, at SaiU, once professors finish correcting the papers, you can directly check your marks with them , either in person or a few professors update it on the LMS , depending on the faculty. This means you often know your performance well before the final transcripts are issued. Many students even calculate their own grades based on the marking breakdown.
When it comes to urgent needs , such as internship applications, exchange programs, or fellowships, the university has always supported students quickly. For instance, Gopi sir, the Controller of Examinations, has personally helped several students, including myself, by issuing official transcripts in just 1–2 days upon urgent request.

For Point 9

Let’s break this down honestly. If it were really true that 90% of the faculty hated the system, then by now we would’ve seen a mass exodus , but that hasn’t happened. The reality is more nuanced: many faculty members continue to stay and contribute meaningfully despite challenges because they believe in the university’s long term vision and academic values. And yes, for some, it's also because they haven’t yet found other institutions that offer a better fit for their research, teaching interests, or academic freedom , which is true at any university.
It’s also important to understand that faculty turnover is a natural and expected part of academia, especially in young institutions still shaping their identity. Even in top global and Indian universities, be it Stanford, NYU, Ashoka, or the IITs, faculty come and go. That’s why you constantly see recruitment postings from the best institutions. If professors never left, those job openings wouldn’t exist.
Yes, some well known names have moved on. But that doesn’t mean everyone has Plenty of qualified and passionate faculty have also joined, and students still have access to strong mentorship and academic guidance. So instead of reducing the narrative to ""who left"", it's more insightful to ask: who stayed, and why?
As for the former VC, leadership changes are common in universities, and they don’t always reflect dysfunction. He moved on, and new leadership has stepped in to correct what went wrong. What matters now is whether the system is evolving, learning, and improving , and we are seeing signs of that happening.
So let’s focus on the full picture, not just one, sided anecdotes. SaiU, like any growing university, is a work in progress, and many are still here, working every day to make it better.


For Point 10 
Let’s be real , holding hands has never been a problem at Sai University. Students have walked around campus, in the Ocean Drive Villas, in the hostel pathways at night, in the student lounge , and no one has ever been expelled or even warned for simply holding hands. If that were the case, half the university would be expelled by now.
But let’s not confuse liberal with lawlessness. SaiU gives students a lot of personal freedom , more than many private universities in India. But like any decent university, there’s a line between personal freedom and public indecency. If someone crosses that line, whether in behavior or inappropriateness in public spaces, the university has the right and responsibility to intervene, usually with a verbal or written warning. That is standard in every serious academic institution, even the international ones.
And to Mr. “Exposing Truth” , it sounds like you want a university that supports and promotes indecency and immorality in the name of freedom. No respected university anywhere , whether it’s in the US, UK, or India , operates without limits. A university is an academic space, not a street, side club.
If you truly care about student rights, please also acknowledge the freedoms we do have , because any third year student will tell you honestly: SaiU is one of the most liberal campuses in terms of student space, autonomy, and personal interaction. It’s only when students misuse that freedom that a response is triggered , and that’s not “moral policing,” that’s just basic campus conduct.

For Point 11

Sai University is still in its early stages of development, being a relatively new institution. That said, the basic sports infrastructure is in place, and improvements are actively underway. The sports field is currently planned to be repaired and renovated next semester, so any concerns about the quality of the playing surface are being addressed.
As for the sports culture at SaiU, we’ve seen significant growth. Recently, the university completed a sports league with around 100 players participating across 4 teams in more than 5 sports, with trophies and other accolades awarded. The university is working to progressively enhance its facilities, and this league marks a milestone in the journey toward creating a more robust sports environment for students.
Additionally, the SaiU Sports Society is planning to invite other universities, like Krea and Ashoka, for intercollege competitions, bringing more competition and diversity to the sports scene at SaiU. We can expect major improvements in the coming semesters, with increased participation from other colleges.
As the university continues to evolve, we can expect more investments in facilities and a broader range of sporting opportunities. The journey is in its early phases, and every milestone brings us closer to the ideal sports experience for all students.
For Point 13
The proof is in the pudding. In no other university would the DVC and VC meet with student representatives for over 4 hours to listen to their concerns and discuss future plans and improvements. This kind of engagement is rare and shows the university’s commitment to student feedback.
While the Student Government is not officially recognized right now, this is due to recent administrative changes with the DVC and VC. The student representatives have only recently introduced themselves to the new leadership, and they’ve been actively engaged in meaningful conversations. The leadership has agreed to take steps toward formally recognizing the Student Council, with official processes for elections and governance planned for next semester.
So, while things are still in transition, the fact that the DVC and VC spent hours listening to students is a clear sign that the university is working towards positive changes. This kind of accessibility is not common in most universities.


Alright, I’ve now addressed all the points where I actually have facts, not gossip. So instead of hiding behind anonymous posts and repeating the same stuff, here’s a wild idea: come talk to me directly.
I’m in Sai University in the campus Hostel , yes, a real person with a real name and real responses. If you're on campus and really care about the truth, bump into me, stop me, ask me whatever you want , I won’t run. And if what you’ve said is 100% true, then why the cloak and dagger routine? Afraid someone might “catch” you for speaking the truth? Please. If you’re that scared, then still , come talk to me. I won’t reveal your name to anyone. Promise.
You can also message me on LinkedIn (Arjun Thilak , https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun,thilak-17248a247/ ) or get my number from the SaiU announcement group , it’s not hard. But let’s stop the anonymous whisper campaign and actually have a real conversation, if you’re up for it.
Otherwise, keep posting from the shadows and pretending you're exposing something big , it’s entertaining, at least.
Just keep in mind: badmouthing the university without understanding what’s actually going on behind the scenes doesn’t just affect the university , it affects the students who are working hard here, and it harms their reputation among recruiters and others outside. So if your goal is to ruin your own peers’ image while accomplishing nothing productive. Congrats!, mission halfway accomplished.
But even if you write 1,000 more posts like this, it’s not going to change much, because the real changes are already happening, and most of what you've written isn’t even true to begin with.",1,1746774108.0,saiu_,0,1.0,False

Over time, she began showing signs of interest—frequent eye contact, staying close by, occasionally sitting with me at lunch.

As a regular guy trying to keep it respectful, I maintained professional conversations, sprinkled in with light, friendly jokes. Then, out of nowhere, her behavior changed—she stopped talking to me and began avoiding me altogether. I hadn’t said anything inappropriate or made any jokes that could be taken the wrong way. I was just being myself—polite and friendly.

To ease the tension, I began engaging with her a bit more, giving her the attention she seemed to respond to previously. Gradually, she returned to being how she was when we first met. So, I thought it would be a good idea to ask her out for a casual coffee—not a date, just a friendly catch-up since she’s been busy and I wanted to see how she’s doing.

It’s been over 24 hours, and she hasn’t responded to my message. She always has her phone with her and is very active on it, so it’s unlikely she just missed it. I’m not overthinking it—I’ve considered she could be tied up with something, but realistically, it’s starting to feel like a sign of disinterest.

I’ve already decided that, even if she does respond later, I’ll politely decline the catch-up and take a step back.

So there’s this really cute guy that i’ve been checking out for a couple years now while he’s working in this tiny coffee shop as it’s located at the train station and I always take the train to work.

I’m too shy to do anything like starting a conversation or asking for his nr or ig.
But todaaaay I ordered a coffee and while he made my coffee he kinda looked up a few times at me and we made eye contact and I started smiling and blushing and looked away everytime ahah…
I find him so attractive!! And really curious about him and what his name is!

Anyways, he suddenly started to talk to me (which never happened before)
And the convo was like:
”did u change your hair? Because you’ve been here before right?” (Aaah he remembers me???)
Me: ”Yeah I did, I know it looks a bit different”
(Because my hair has changed drastically since)
Him: ”do you like it?”
Me: yeah I do, what do you think, do you like it? Like honestly?” (ahaha idk why I said it like this but it was all in a lil playful cheeky tone and I hope he thinks that too)
Him: ”yeah na, honestly it looks really good!”
And I could hear a customer next to me giggle a little?? And he gave me my coffee and I only responded with a thank you (for the coffee and the compliment)

I wish I said something more… at least wishing him a good day but I didn’t. The customer that giggled throw me off a lil I guess.
Made me think if I said something stupid ahahah!
But yeah I really wanna order a coffee there again, maybe in the morning when he’s the only one working.

What’s your advice?
Should I leave him a note or ask him directly?
How can I start the convo next time I see him so it’s not quiet?
Do you think this is a good sign and that he’s maybe into me too?
I can’t stop smiling since this morning when it happened and i’m glad he finally talked to me!

One day, he told me he was a Catholic priest, but I didn't mind because I enjoyed talking to him.
After a few days, he asked if we could meet in person, for coffee or something, and I agreed. We met several more times, and he introduced me to his priest friends and took me to his church.
Again, I love talking and spending time with him.
One day, he invited me to his church chambers. We were talking when he suddenly kissed me and touched my penis. Obviously, I got hard, sucked my cock, and asked me to fuck him, which I did.
I remember being very confused and embarrassed, but I didn't do anything to stop him. Once we finished, I left and went home. I saw him two or three times after that just to talk, but it wasn't the same, at least not for me. I know he didn't force me or anything, but as a Catholic, I felt something was wrong.
I stopped seeing him and never heard from him again.

Sometimes I wonder if he ever did the same thing to children, and I feel bad. I hope he's gotten himself under control and just sticks to consensual sex with adults.

A clogged drain is the last thing anyone wants to deal with, right? That’s where **Johnny Rooter Plumbing** comes in! If you’re in **Levittown**, we offer top-notch **drain cleaning, leak detection, and repair services** to keep your home running smoothly.

In this guide, we’ll dive into the importance of professional drain cleaning, the dangers of hidden leaks, and how [**Johnny Rooter Plumbing**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/sewer-and-drain/) can save you time, money, and frustration.

**Introduction – The Hidden Dangers Lurking in Your Pipes**

**Why Plumbing Maintenance Should Be a Top Priority**

When was the last time you thought about your plumbing system? If you’re like most homeowners, probably not until something went wrong. Unfortunately, plumbing issues tend to creep up when you least expect them – and they often start in places you can't even see. Behind your walls and under your floors, hidden leaks can silently damage your home, and drains can become breeding grounds for bacteria and mold.

Regular plumbing maintenance isn't just a good idea – it’s essential. Neglecting your pipes can lead to clogs, water damage, sky-high utility bills, and even structural issues. And in Levittown, where homes range from historic to newly built, the risk of plumbing issues varies just as widely. That's why it’s crucial to work with a professional plumbing team that understands the local landscape and challenges.





**The Importance of Drain Cleaning**

**How Clogged Drains Affect Your Home**

Let’s get one thing straight: clogged drains are *not* just a minor inconvenience. Over time, even a small blockage can lead to major issues. Backups, foul odors, water stains, and even flooding can result from neglected drains. If you've ever had water overflow from your sink or tub, you know the frustration—and mess—it brings.

Clogs are often caused by everyday habits—pouring grease down the sink, flushing paper towels, or even just regular soap scum and hair buildup. In Levittown homes, especially older ones, outdated piping can make your plumbing even more vulnerable. Left untreated, that slow-draining sink could lead to a cracked pipe or a flooded basement.

Cleaning your drains regularly helps:

* Prevent blockages and backups
* Improve water flow and pressure
* Reduce the risk of mold and mildew
* Eliminate gurgling noises and foul smells

**Signs It’s Time to Clean Your Drains**

Not sure if you need drain cleaning? Watch out for these red flags:

* **Slow-draining sinks or tubs**
* **Standing water**
* **Gurgling sounds**
* **Unpleasant odors coming from drains**
* **Water backing up into other fixtures**

If you're dealing with any of the above, it's time to call the pros. Ignoring these signs can make the problem worse—and much more expensive to fix.

**DIY Drain Cleaning vs. Professional Services**

Sure, you can try a plunger or a store-bought drain cleaner—but be careful. Many over-the-counter drain cleaners use harsh chemicals that can damage your pipes over time. Plus, they often only offer a temporary fix.

At Johnny Rooter Plumbing, we use:

* **Hydro-jetting:** A high-pressure water method that clears out the toughest blockages.
* **Video camera inspections:** To pinpoint exactly where the clog is.
* **Snaking and rodding:** For precision removal of buildup without damaging your pipes.

Professional drain cleaning not only fixes the issue—it prevents future problems. And with us, you get long-term results and peace of mind.

**Leak Detection – The Silent Problem**

**Common Causes of Household Leaks**

Leaks are sneaky. They often go unnoticed for weeks—or even months—until they’ve caused serious damage. Some of the most common culprits include:

* **Worn-out pipe joints**
* **Cracked or corroded pipes**
* **Damaged seals on fixtures**
* **Excessive water pressure**
* **Root intrusion into underground pipes**

Older homes in Levittown are particularly at risk, especially if they still have galvanized steel plumbing or original copper lines. Even small pinhole leaks can ruin drywall, warp floors, and cause mold infestations if ignored.

**Why Early Detection Matters**

Catching leaks early is crucial for both your wallet and your home. A leak the size of a pinhole can waste **over 90 gallons of water a day**. That’s not just bad for the environment—it’s bad for your bank account.

More importantly, undetected leaks can:

* Destroy drywall and flooring
* Compromise your home's foundation
* Create the perfect environment for mold and mildew
* Attract pests like termites or cockroaches

With **early detection**, you save money, reduce waste, and protect your home’s structural integrity.

**Technology Used by Johnny Rooter for Leak Detection**

We don’t guess—we use **advanced tools** to locate leaks with pinpoint accuracy. Our arsenal includes:

* **Acoustic leak detectors** to hear even the faintest drips
* **Infrared cameras** to detect moisture behind walls
* **Pressure testing systems** to check for drops in water pressure
* **Pipe inspection cameras** to visually confirm damage

This high-tech approach means fewer holes in your walls and faster, more accurate repairs.

1. **Initial Assessment:** We start by listening. What symptoms are you noticing? Is it one sink or your whole house? This helps us narrow down the issue.
2. **Camera Inspection:** Our high-resolution drain cameras go inside your pipes to locate the blockage and identify the cause—whether it’s grease, tree roots, or debris buildup.
3. **Cleaning Method Selection:** Based on the inspection, we choose the most effective method:
   * Snaking for minor clogs
   * Hydro-jetting for stubborn blockages
   * Manual extraction if foreign objects are found

5. **Final Review:** We walk you through what we found and share tips for keeping your drains clean.

This step-by-step approach minimizes guesswork and ensures a job done right the first time.

**Our Leak Detection Workflow**

Leak detection isn’t just about spotting water on the floor. It’s about using **state-of-the-art technology** to uncover issues you can’t see.

Here’s how we handle it:

1. **Visual & Verbal Clues:** We ask questions, inspect common leak zones, and check water meter readings for unusual spikes.
2. **Infrared & Acoustic Tools:** These allow us to detect leaks behind walls, beneath floors, and even under concrete slabs.
3. **Camera Inspections:** Especially for underground pipes or wall systems, we use flexible camera tools to confirm damage and pinpoint its location.
4. **Detailed Report & Plan:** Once we find the leak, we provide a full explanation and multiple repair options—always with your budget in mind.
5. **Swift, Non-Invasive Repair:** We aim to keep the repair process as clean and disruption-free as possible. Many minor leaks can be resolved the same day.

**Preventative Maintenance Tips for Homeowners**

**Weekly and Monthly Plumbing Checklist**

Want to avoid costly plumbing disasters? A little maintenance goes a long way. Here’s a simple checklist to keep your system running smoothly:

**Weekly:**

* Run hot water down bathroom and kitchen sinks
* Check for puddles or damp spots under sinks
* Inspect washing machine hoses for bulges or leaks

**Monthly:**

* Pour a mixture of vinegar and baking soda down your drains to break up buildup
* Clean hair catchers in showers and tubs
* Check toilet tanks and bowls for cracks or leaks
* Examine exposed pipes for signs of corrosion or moisture

**What to Avoid Putting Down the Drain**

Not all waste is created equal. Here’s a list of items you should *never* send down the drain:

🚫 Grease and cooking oils  
🚫 Coffee grounds  
🚫 Eggshells  
🚫 Pasta and rice (they expand!)  
🚫 Flushable wipes (they’re *not* really flushable)  
🚫 Paint, chemicals, or solvents

Educating your family on what not to flush or drain can save you hundreds—if not thousands—of dollars in future repairs.

**When to Call the Pros**

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, problems arise. Call Johnny Rooter Plumbing if:

* You hear strange noises (gurgling, banging)
* Your water pressure suddenly drops
* Your drains smell funky despite cleaning
* You notice mold, mildew, or warped walls/floors

Don’t wait until a small issue becomes a huge one. Early intervention is the key to saving money and avoiding stress.

**Cost Guide: Drain Cleaning & Leak Repair in Levittown**

**What Influences the Price?**

Plumbing isn’t a one-size-fits-all service, and the same goes for pricing. The cost of[ **drain cleaning and leak detection in Levittown**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-repair-and-installation/) can vary depending on several key factors:

* **Severity of the issue:** A minor clog will naturally cost less than a deep-rooted blockage requiring hydro-jetting or pipe replacement.
* **Accessibility:** Leaks inside walls, ceilings, or under concrete slabs are more time-consuming and labor-intensive to address.
* **Type of repair needed:** A quick sealant fix costs less than replacing an entire section of piping.
* **Technology used:** Advanced camera inspections or acoustic leak detection tools may slightly increase the price, but they save money in the long run by ensuring precision.

**Transparent Pricing from Johnny Rooter Plumbing**

At Johnny Rooter Plumbing, **clarity is everything**. From your first call, we’ll give you a breakdown of all expected costs—*no hidden fees*. Before we touch a tool, you’ll know exactly what we’re doing, why it’s necessary, and how much it’ll cost.

We also provide:

* **Free initial inspections** for first-time customers
* **Flat-rate pricing** on common services
* **Upfront quotes** with written estimates
* **Multiple payment options**, including financing for major repairs

We believe that great plumbing shouldn’t break the bank. That’s why we offer flexible pricing to fit nearly every budget.

**How to Save on Long-Term Plumbing Costs**

Plumbing doesn’t have to be a financial drain (pun intended!). Here are some smart ways to keep costs down over time:

* **Schedule annual inspections** to catch problems early
* **Use strainers and catchers** in your sinks and tubs
* **Avoid harsh drain cleaners** that corrode your pipes
* **Install water pressure regulators** to protect your plumbing
* **Sign up for a maintenance plan** with Johnny Rooter Plumbing

With proactive care, you can dramatically reduce the risk of expensive emergencies—and keep your plumbing system working like a dream.

**Eco-Friendly Plumbing Solutions**

**Green Drain Cleaning Products We Use**

Being environmentally conscious is no longer optional—it’s essential. At Johnny Rooter Plumbing, we use eco-friendly drain cleaning solutions that are:

* **Biodegradable**

“I had no idea what to do. I called Johnny Rooter at 3 a.m., and someone actually answered. They were at my house in under 45 minutes. They shut off the water, found the burst pipe behind the wall, and had everything fixed by noon. Total lifesavers.”

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**1. How often should I get my drains professionally cleaned?**

Most homes benefit from professional drain cleaning once a year. However, if your home sees heavy kitchen use, you have older plumbing, or notice recurring clogs, you might want service every 6–9 months.

**2. What are the signs of a hidden leak in my home?**

Common signs include unexplained water bills, mold growth, damp or warped walls, a musty smell, or the sound of running water when everything’s off. If you notice any of these, call Johnny Rooter ASAP!

**3. Can I use chemical drain cleaners for small clogs?**

We don’t recommend it. Over-the-counter drain cleaners can corrode your pipes, harm the environment, and may only push the clog further down. Our eco-friendly methods are safer and far more effective.

**4. Do you offer emergency plumbing services in Levittown?**

Absolutely. We’re available 24/7 for all plumbing emergencies—including leaks, burst pipes, sewage backups, and more. Just give us a call and we’ll be there fast.

1kic23x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kic23x/aitah_for_most_likely_breaking_up_with_my_bf/,AITAH for (most likely) breaking up with my bf?,"hello,

as you can tell by my title, i am thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend. it honestly sucks to come on here to ask for outside opinions to see if my decision is right.

a little context, my boyfriend (21) and i (20F) have been dating for almost two years. we met on a dating app and things progressed nicely. he is my first boyfriend and i love him a lot. 

we have spent the past two years with a couple bumps, but nothing serious lately. our first hiccup was him blaming me for something i didn't do. he blamed me for something his mom found in their house. he apologized and we moved on from that. our second bump was him feeling like he didn't love me anymore. i know, why did i stay and tolerate that? our third was over his family and their political beliefs. 

more on his family, we come from opposite sides of what family looks like. he's a cis-white male and has only one sibling, so small family. i am from an asian household where family is always first. he does not put in effort to get to know my family, and even though we've talked about this multiple times, he still doesn't put any effort but he expects me to be besties with his mom.

the main problem that has driven me to this point is money. i know how that sounds but please hear me out. i am the third out of five children, i have always worked for what i have. i barely let this man buy me anything. he complains that i should let him buy me things because he wants to. but he wants to buy me things that he wants to buy me, never things i want. for example, i will pick up one make-it-mini ball just to see it, and he will insist on buying it for me. but i could ask for a plush down the aisle and he will throw a fit, insisting that i don't need it and should get the mini toy so he can build it. highlight: he wants to build it. several weeks ago, we came across one of those ""how well do you know your gf"" quizzes and the bet was on a makeup spree. he lost and said that he would do it for me, which obviously excited me. i have asked a couple times when we could go do it, but he keeps brushing it off, saying he wants to wait for his paycheck. not to sound greedy, but it's been two paychecks. so i asked him if he actually wanted to do it or if he is just brushing it off because he doesn't want to spend the money. he kind of got mad and said that he didn't want to spend the money. honest to god, if he had told me that before, i wouldn't have pushed the subject. 

now, i have two jobs and am a full time college student. obviously, i don't make enough to afford a living (i live with my parents), but i do have enough to spend on me and him. i usually buy us food once or twice a week. and we only see each other on the weekend. i went through a period of not making as much money as i usually did, and i relied a little more on him for the usual eating out. he said that this made it seem like i was using him for money. this took me aback because i had never ever relied on him for money. 

so, these past few weeks, he's put the food on me. and i didn't complain. this past weekend, we said we'd split on wingstop. i paid for it, and he told me he'd pay me back. after eating, i asked if he was gonna pay it back with cash or through venmo, but once again, he kinda lashed out on me. he said that i was selfish for always asking for money back and that he wasn't going to pay it.

i really hate the stupid money talk but it's literally what's tearing us apart right now. i understand he may be struggling with money a little, but he donates plasma twice a week, and works overtime a few times a month. 

it's not only money, but this man can only provide physical happiness for me. when it comes to emotionally, he's practically not there. when i am emotionally drained, he thinks i'm dumping him. he offers no support unless i'm crying in front of him, begging him to understand why i can't give him my body, or why i can't tell him right away why i'm so drained. he doesn't listen, he hears. everything he thinks he solely provides for me, i actually have been and can provide for myself. i don't think he realizes this. 

we've had so many conversations about his lacking in listening and change. he still has yet to grow. with this man, i feel like he's always in the ""i hate my girlfriend"" phase. he barely knows what i like and how i like things. when he sets dinner, he puts my fork on the right side, despite knowing i'm left handed. he doesn't know my coffee order despite asking me a multitude of times. all he knows is what i like from the gas station. and he gloats about that. meanwhile, i know what kind of toilet paper he likes, what shaver and shaving cream he uses.

so because of these factors, i've decided that maybe it's best to let him go. AITAH?",2,1746772993.0,AITAH,2,0.76,False
1kic1tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kic1tw/i_19m_confessed_to_a_classmate_18f_and_she_says/,I [19M] confessed to a classmate [18F] and she says she has a boyfriend — but her actions tell me otherwise. What now?,"I’ve been studying in the same group with this girl [18F] at university for about a semester, but only recently did we start talking more — and I quickly developed feelings for her.

I invited her for a casual coffee at our uni canteen, and she surprisingly agreed. We ended up having a deep talk — she even told me about some family issues on that very first meeting. I felt like there was trust or at least comfort, which encouraged me to keep going.

Still, we kept talking in person sometimes, like walking around the hallways, chatting, sharing thoughts. It felt like something was there.

Later, I asked her out several times — just casual stuff like the cinema or a walk. She always found a reason not to come even though she willingly agreed to go out: she wanted to play some videogames with her friends online, then got sick, then recovered, then she said she didn't know why she agreed to walk with me and she's not into walking at all.

Eventually, I confessed to her. I brought a small gift and asked if she’d mind holding my hand — I just wanted to feel more grounded before saying something important. She didn’t reject the gesture. I told her I really liked her and even said I loved her. She said she wouldn’t mind staying in touch and talking more — but she’s not the type to spend time outside — she prefers online communication. And she also told me she has a boyfriend.

The thing is, I honestly don’t believe that’s true. Based on how she acts with me, the level of comfort, the fact she never outright rejected me or set boundaries, I feel like it might have just been a way to deflect the pressure without hurting me. And if she did have a boyfriend, I highly doubt she’d accept these meetups or hold hands with me.

I still love her, but I’m unsure what to do next. I don’t want to be disrespectful or pushy — but I also don’t want to cut things off too early if there’s still something there.

I’m not looking to judge her or accuse her of anything — I just don’t know if I should give her more space and move on, or if there’s a respectful way to continue this connection without crossing boundaries. What would be the healthiest mindset or approach in a situation like this?

Length of relationship: About 6 months as classmates, around 1–2 months of active communication.

TL;DR: I confessed to a girl [18F] in my university group. She opened up to me, met up with me, held hands when I confessed, and seemed emotionally comfortable. But she said she has a boyfriend. I don’t think that’s true. I’m trying to figure out how to handle the next steps.",0,1746772956.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False
1kic1kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1kic1kk/buds3_pro_and_socalled_anc/,Buds3 Pro and so-called ANC,"I just wanted to share my experience and ask if anyone has any recommendations for other brands? I have been a Samsung fan for at least 10 years and have had buds+ for many years. Now I've decided to upgrade to Buds3 Pro. They are nice, comfortable and the ANC stuff sounds interesting. The problem is that I currently have the ANC on maximum. I am waiting for some work to be done on my car and I am in a normal self-service restaurant next to the repair shop. It blocks 95% of the noise, but then it sounds like this:
- Someone slamming the door. It feels like it is next to my head.
- Someone coughing 10 m away feels like they are standing next to me.
- A woman behind the counter slamming her coffee grinder thing feels like she's hitting me in the face.
- Background music, I can hear the voices fine, the music is muted.

What is that? How can this be good and cost 100 Euros? Do you really have to buy Sony in-ear headphones for 300 euros to get a good ANC experience on Android? This experience just makes me more nervous. I've read so many reviews saying that the ANC is very good. If this is good, what is bad ANC?

One buys such thing only in every few years but having few work colleagues with pro Apple in-ear headphones made me want ANC because they are completely off when they have headphones in. ",0,1746772924.0,samsung,9,0.33,False

Lily POV  
  
I used to think I could withstand anything fate threw at me…  
  
I mean – I was hated by my father and my sister, practically a maid in my own house and the invisible daughter of Alpha Stone … but nothing prepared me for the sight that greeted me.  
  
My hands trembled on the doorknob of my sister’s bedroom as a strangled gasp escaped my lips. The door was slightly ajar, and through the narrow gap, I could see Lucas – my boyfriend and mate-to-be of three years cuddled together with my sister, Vanessa on the bed.  
  
Their voices drifted out, hushed but clear in the quiet hallway.  
  
“Just reject her, and it will be over,” Vanessa murmured, running her fingers through Lucas’s hair. “You promised me, Lucas. Don’t chicken out now,”.  
  
Lucas sighed, pulling Vanessa closer. “I know that, but… it’s her birthday today, Nessa. Can’t it wait?”  
  
Vanessa's eyes narrowed as the corner of her lips lifted into a sneer. “And also, mine, in case you’ve forgotten.  So, consider it my birthday gift… it has to be today. Trust me, it’s better this way,”.  
  
The hallways spun under my feet and my vision blurred, my mind reeling as the words I just heard sank in. I stumbled back from the door, my heart shattering into a thousand pieces.  
  
“I’m getting cheated on and rejected on the same day as my birthday,” I whispered to myself as tears rolled down my cheeks “Thank you, moon goddess, a perfect way to start my 18th…,”.  
  
\~\~\~24 Hours Earlier\~\~\~  
  
I was known as the child who killed her mother at birth…  
  
But if you’re kind enough and want to call me by my name, then it’s Lily…Lily Stone.  
  
I was lounging at the small window of my room which was the attic of the Golden Moon Packhouse, gazing out at the lush forest that bordered the pack lands. The evening sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, a beautiful sight that usually uplifts my spirits but today I felt empty.  
  
Tomorrow, was my 18th birthday, a day that should be filled with excitement and celebration. Instead, a familiar sense of dread settled in my stomach.  
  
I turned away from the window, my eyes falling on the small calendar on my desk. Two birthdays were circled in red: mine and my sister Vanessa’s. I was so unfortunate to be born on the same birth date as Vanessa and one would think we would be sharing our special day. When in reality, Vanessa’s birthday always overshadowed mine.  
  
No one even remembers that I was born that day. No gifts, not even a birthday song.  
  
Sighing, I ran my hand through my long, chestnut hair. Wondering what it would be like to have a normal family. One that cared about me. But that was a luxury, I’d never know.  
  
My father, Alpha Gregory Stone had never shown me an ounce of affection; but it was understandable since his mate had died protecting me. And Vanessa?  Well, sisterly love was not in her vocabulary.  
  
To her, I was as good as one of the Omegas that served in the pack house.  
  
A soft chime from my phone pulled me out of my thoughts. My heart pulsated with happiness when I saw it was a message from Lucas my boyfriend. If there was one bright spot in my miserable life, it was him. Lucas had been my rock – he was the son of the Pack’s Gamma but rather than bullying me like every other person did, he was the only one who extended a hand of friendship to me and since then… our love had grown into a deep bond.  
  
My hands flew over my phone as I responded to his greeting.  
  
“Hi, Can’t wait to see you tomorrow. What time are you coming?”  
  
I held my breath, waiting for his response. We had a big fight a few days ago, it was a miracle we were still talking to each other. My heart fluttered with warmth when I noticed that he had read the message immediately and was typing back. Even if I had no one to rely on, even if my family seemed to forget my existence including the entire pack, on days like tomorrow, I rely on Lucas.  
  
“Might run a bit late. I have something to take care of first. But I’ll be there, I promise,” he replied.  
  
A small frown creased my forehead as I stared at his message. “Is everything okay?” I typed back quickly.  
  
“Yeah, don’t worry—just some stuff to take care of. I’ve got plans for us,” he replied again.  
  
A small smile tugged at my lips as I sighed with relief. Lucas always prepared something small and intimate for my birthdays. He was the only person that made me feel seen, who made my birthday feel like it mattered.  
  
“Okay, no problem,” I typed back attaching a lot of emojis. “Looking forward to it!”.  
  
I set my phone down and flopped onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off with Lucas lately. We’ve fought more this month than we had in all the years of our relationship and it was over very insignificant issues.  
  
He was becoming more distant these days. His messages were shorter and less frequent and it took him hours to reply every time I brought it up, he would assure me everything was fine or he would say I was obsessing too much over him.  
  
“Stop it!” I muttered to myself. “You’re just being paranoid,”.  
  
I have to give Lucas a break… as a son of our Pack’s Gamma, the beam was on him now that he was an adult. Naturally, everyone expects that he would take over the reins once his father retires, so, I would cut him some slack.  
  
I decided to go downstairs. I had intentionally avoided going there today since the entire Pack House buzzed with activity. The preparations were for Vanessa’s 18th birthday.  
  
As I crept down the stairs, voices drifted from the living room - the unmistakable voice of my father and Vanessa’s pretty high-pitched laughter.  
  
“Sweetheart, you’re going to love your gift,” he said, his voice warm with affection. “I can’t wait to see your face when you open it,”.  
  
I inched closer, peering from the doorway. My stomach twisted with jealousy and sadness as I saw my father sitting on the couch, his arms draped casually around Vanessa’s shoulders. She was curled against him, staring at him with adoring eyes. On the coffee table, was a large wrapped, gift box tied with an elegant bow.  
  
“Daddy!” her delighted squeal filled the air “You shouldn’t have. You’ve done enough already,”.  
  
“Nonsense, Nessa,” he chuckled pressing a kiss on her forehead. “My little girl only turns 19 once and you deserve to have the best party in the history of Golden Moon Pack. Plus, you deserve to be spoiled. You’re royalty,”.  
  
Tears gathered in my eyes as I stared at Alpha Gregory… Our father… I’ve never heard him speak to me with such tenderness. Swallowing hard, I stepped into the living room. They both looked up as I entered and immediately, their smiles faded.  
  
“Lily,” he said, his voice suddenly cold. “What are you doing down here? Didn’t I tell you to remain in your room today? I don’t want you to be in the way of the decorators,”.  
  
I fought the urge to roll my eyes. “I was just getting some water,”.  
  
“Well, hurry up and get back to your room. I don’t want you touching anything or ruining something. By the way, I was just telling Vanessa about her birthday party tomorrow, here at the pack house,”.  
  
Vanessa smirked, tossing her perfect hair over her shoulder. “It’s going to be amazing. Everyone who’s anyone will be there,”.  
  
I stood frozen, suddenly feeling like an intruder. “Oh,” I managed to say. “That sounds … nice,”.  
  
I watched as the Alpha’s expression hardened. Fixing me a cold stare, he said: “I want to make something clear, Lily. Tomorrow’s party is for Vanessa. I don’t want you showing up and causing any … disturbances,”.  
  
The words hit me like a physical blow. I knew my father didn’t care much for me, but to be explicitly uninvited to a party on my birthday? That was a new low.  
  
Vanessa’s eyes glittered with mockery. “Oh, don’t be so hard on her, Daddy. I’m sure Lily understands. After all, she wouldn’t want to ruin my special day, would she?”  
  
“But…” I started; my voice small. “It’s my birthday too,”.  
  
He waved his hand dismissively. “You know what I mean. This is Vanessa’s special day. You’ll only upset her if you’re there,”.  
  
Vanessa nodded, a mocking sympathetic look on her face. “It’s just… you know how you are, Lily. Always so awkward. It would ruin the mood,”.  
  
The patronizing tone made my blood boil. I wanted to retort and remind them that they made me this way. They made it impossible for me to belong to this pack. From working like a slave in the pack house to Vanessa constantly picking on me with her friends.  
  
So, if I was awkward, it was because of them.  
  
I felt tears pricking at my eyes but I refused to let them fall. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction. Instead, I lifted my chin, meeting my father’s cold gaze.  
  
“Fine!” I said my voice steadier than I had expected. “I’ll stay in my room and make sure I won’t be in your way. So, happy birthday dearest sister, in advance of course, since I will be making extra effort not to ruin your day. And just so you know, I have plans with Lucas… so, I’ll be busy too,”.  
  
“Don’t be like that, Lily,” she snickered “I would have wished you a happy birthday but, you shouldn’t have been born in the first place and on my birthday of all days. I wish you were never born,”.  
  
Vanessa always looks for new ways to make me feel less of myself but thankfully, I’ve grown a thick skin.  
  
So, I didn’t say anything in reply, I simply flashed her a defiant smile and murmured under my breath as I left.  
  
“I don’t care about your stupid party anyway! I have Lucas!”  
  


# Chapter 2

Lily POV  
  
I trudged back to my room, my father’s cold words and Vanessa’s smirk still echoing in my mind. I was used to their ill-treatment. I should be used to it, but every time they spoke to me like this, the sting of their words would pierce through my heart, leaving me miserable.  
  
Collapsing onto my bed, I closed my eyes, allowing myself to drift into fantasies of having the best birthday ever tomorrow – one where Lucas would make me feel special and loved.  
  
I had barely settled into the dream when the annoying buzz of my alarm clock rang, jolting me awake. Stretching like a lazy cat, I stared at the wall opposite me for a few minutes, I couldn’t believe I was 18 today. Instead of excitement, a familiar weight settled in my chest.  
  
No one cared that I was 18 today…  
  
Also, I had to make breakfast for my father and Vanessa and do other chores… it didn’t matter that today was my birthday.  
  
Dragging myself out of bed, I made my way to the kitchen. Since no one was up, I had the pack house to myself for a few minutes.  
  
About time,” Vanessa sneered as she sauntered into the kitchen, shattering my peaceful moment and my daydreaming. She looked dressed up. “I’m starving,”.  
  
A second later, Alpha Gregory came down too, and walked straight to Vanessa ignoring my ‘Good morning Dad,”.  
  
“Happy birthday princess!” he exclaimed, placing a glittering tiara on Vanessa’s perfectly styled hair. “We party hard tonight,”.  
  
Vanessa squealed with delight as she ran to the mirror in the hallway to check the tiara, then came back panting. “Oh, Daddy, it’s beautiful. You’re the best,”.  
  
Alpha Gregory barely spared me a glance as he settled onto his side of the table and picked up the morning paper. After reading for a while, he looked up at me. The first glance he was giving me since he came downstairs.  
  
“Don’t forget to clean up before you leave,” He said, his tone leaving no room for argument.  
  
“Yes, Dad,” I nodded silently watching as they ate their breakfast. I would eat later after they finish.  
  
After eating they both left the house. Finally, alone, I cleared the table and ate one hard, boiled egg before going back to my room. I retrieved the dress I’d been saving up for months to buy.  
  
Since I didn’t have an allowance like Vanessa, I had to save up the little pennies I scraped from going to the market and running errands around the pack for me. The dress was a beautiful emerald green that brought out the gold flecks in my hazel eyes. Slipping it on, I stood before the mirror, admiring how it hugged my curves.  
  
For a brief moment, I imagined myself as beautiful as Vanessa. My sister was the belle of the pack. She was tall… without being too tall and slender with the right amount of cheekbones, colour of eyes and beautiful hair. She always drew eyes wherever she went. Me on the other hand, my chestnut curly hair was hard to tame, despite everything I had done, my hazel eyes and freckled face made me look like I had existed in the dragon age and it didn’t help that I was fat.  
  
I had bigger boobs, bigger butts and wider hips that I have to always hide with big clothes. I looked like a boar compared to Vanessa who was as beautiful as a gazelle and carried herself well. People often told me I looked like my mother – my father’s mate who had died shortly after giving birth to me. The very reason why my dad – Alpha Gregory hates me. To him, I killed his mate.  
  
Studying my reflection, I felt a pang of longing. I wished I had known my mother, maybe I could have experienced the love and acceptance I’d always craved and maybe my father would hate me less.  
  
I styled my stubborn hair and applied light makeup from the products Vanessa had thrown away last month because another Alpha’s daughter from school told her they didn’t match her skin tone. Satisfied with my little touchup, I headed downstairs.  
  
The house was already bustling with activity. Decorators rushed in and out, shouting instructions to each other, hanging streamers and arranging flowers. The party was supposed to start in the evening and it was only noon, I wondered why they were all freaking out.  
  
The delicious aroma of freshly baked cake wafted from the kitchen to my nose and for a moment, I allowed myself to imagine it was all for me.  
  
Exhaling, I started for me Lucas’s secret spot – a small clearing in the woods near the border of the pack lands. It was when Lucas first asked me to be his girlfriend when we’d shared our first kiss. Surely, he would make this birthday special.  
  
My stomach fluttered with excitement when I arrived at the clearing expecting to see some decorations but nothing was there and there was no sign of Lucas too. Maybe he got caught up with something besides, it’s the thoughts that matter and not decoration. I told myself.  
  
Minutes ticked into hours… and the initial excitement turned to worry. Lucas was never late, not for our meetings. Four hours passed and there was no sign of him. By now, I know the pack house will be filled to the brim with people for the party.  
  
One more hour later, it was dark already and I couldn’t bear waiting any longer. With a heavy heart, I left the secret spot and started heading home. Lucas must have been so busy. As I approached the pack house, the sounds of music and laughter grew louder, a stark reminder of the celebration I wasn’t part of.  
  
“I’ll just go to my room, change into something casual and go check up on Lucas,” I murmured to myself.  
  
“Isn’t that the other ‘weird sister’ – Lily Stone,” someone announced with a microphone, making me freeze. When I turned, it was Vanessa’s group of friends. They came towards me immediately, flanking me on all sides, making it difficult for me to continue to my room.  
  
The others laughed, their eyes roving over my dress with disdain. Since I’d been caught, there was no need to hide now. “I know you all are dumb but I didn’t know you’d be dumb enough not to figure that I live here too…and that means I can come and go as I please. If your alcohol bedazzled minds had allowed you to think, you’d have noticed that I was heading upstairs, to my room,”.  
  
“Wow!” the girls exclaimed in unison, clapping, still laughing “What’s making you so brazen today? Is it the new age?” one of them asked.  
  
“It should be the dress,” one of them pointed out.  
  
“I wonder what charity home she had to go pick this up from. You should swing by my house later, I have lots of clothes that are ten times better than what you’re wearing. Consider it, a gesture to help a destitute like you,”.  
  
“Wouldn’t that make me as dumb as you, Aria?” I recognized her. She was the Beta’s daughter. “I heard you’d need to retake sophomore year for the third time in a row. “That’s too bad dear… all your friends would have graduated and left before you ever caught up,” I retorted with a smile.  
  
Aria scoffed with annoyance. I could see that my words had gone right through her. The other girls snickered, each one of them looking away. Aria scoffed and folded her hands, looking at me with mockery.  
  
“At least my boyfriend didn’t desert me to attend my sister’s birthday party instead,” she said  
  
My heart pricked with fear at her words. It could only mean one thing… Lucas had come to the party just like I suspected. Ignoring the taunts, I pushed past them. I had more important things to worry about now – finding Lucas.  
  
I searched the crowded living room, the kitchen, and even the backyard but Lucas was nowhere to be seen. With each passing minute, the knot in my stomach tightened. Where could he be? Why didn’t he just tell me he was at Vanessa’s party? It was probably his father that forced him to attend.  
  
As a last resort, I headed upstairs. The second floor was off-limits for the party, but I thought Lucas might have gone up to escape the noise. He hated parties just like me. But as I passed by Vanessa’s room, my ears caught muffled voices from within.  
  
I paused for a while, hoping I wasn’t hearing things. There was no way the celebrant of the party would be in her room when the party was just starting. But it wouldn’t hurt to check.  
  
My hand hovered over the doorknob, hesitating. Then I heard it – Lucas’s laugh, followed by Vanessa’s sultry giggle. My blood ran cold. I pressed my ears against the door.  
  
“You should just reject her, Lucas,” Vanessa’s voice came through now. “She’s no good for you. We’d be so much stronger together. My wolf is more powerful unlike her who has no wolf and to the best of my knowledge, she didn’t get any today and you know what it means when someone doesn’t get their wolf on their 18th birthday. Think about it, Lucas, you could be the next Alpha if we mate,”.  
  
My heart pounded in my chest, as my ears strained to hear Lucas’s response.  
  
“I know, I know!” he replied, his voice low and husky. “But I’ve been with Lily for three years. I can’t just dump her, especially on her birthday of all days. It’ll break her. So, we need to take this slow and easy… be smart about it. I wasn’t planning on ending up with her anyways,”.  
  
A gasp escaped my lips before I could stop it. I stumbled backwards, bumping into a small table in the hallway. The vase on top wobbled and crashed to the floor, shattering into a thousand pieces.  
  
The voices in the room went silent. Moments later, the door flew open and Vanessa stood there, her perfect hair slightly mussed, wearing nothing but a silky robe. Behind her, Lucas scrambled to pull on his shirt, his face pale with shock.  
  
“Well, well,” Vanessa drawled, clapping as a cruel smile spread across her face. “Look what we have here. Lily, the little spy,”.  
  
I stood frozen, my eyes darting between Vanessa and Lucas. “How…how could you?” I whispered to him, my voice breaking.  
  
He stepped forwards raising his hands placatingly. “Willow, I can explain -,”.  
  
“Oh, stop it, Lucas,” Vanessa cut him off, rolling her eyes. “No more pretending please. Let’s just put her out of her misery… she deserves to know the truth,”.  
  
Then she turned to me “Did you think he could ever truly want you? Look at you – no wolf, no power, nothing to offer. You’re pathetic, Lily. Always have been, always will be,”.  
  
“Lucas, please,” I pleaded, tears streaming down my face. “Tell me it’s not true. We love each other, don’t we?”  
  
But Lucas couldn’t meet my eyes. “I’m sorry, Lily. I never meant for you to find out like this,”.  
  
Vanessa laughed, “Oh, this is rich. Did you believe he loves you? Wake up little sister. You were just a placeholder until something better came along,”.  
  
The room spun but I refused to believe this was happening. Perhaps, he was under duress, Vanessa had a way to make anyone do what she wanted.  
  
Vanessa then turned to Lucas. “You know what you need to do now, don’t you? It’s time to end this charade once and for all,”.  
  
I saw him hesitate his eyes darting between me and Vanessa. Suddenly, I saw the moment his resolve hardened, and my heart shattered.  
  
“Do it!” Vanessa urged. “Reject her, right now!”  
  
Time slowed as he stepped towards me. I wanted to run, to hide… anything to delay the blow I was about to receive but my feet felt rooted to the spot. I watched, as if from a great distance as Lucas’s lips moved…  
  
“I, Lucas Steele, reject you, Lily Stone as my mate,”.  
  
The pain was immediate and overwhelming, I felt like my soul was being torn apart. I gasped, clutching at my chest as the agony of his rejection coursed through my body. I stumbled to the ground, fighting the darkness that slowly enclosed me.  
  
The last thing I saw before the darkness claimed me was Vanessa’s triumphant smile.

SYDNEY'S POV  
  
I received a pornographic video.""Do you like this?""  
  
The man speaking in the video is my mate and husband,Alexander Torres, the Alpha of the Nightscar Pack, whom I haven't seen for several months. He is naked, his shirt and pants scattered on the ground, thrusting forcefully on a woman whose face I can't see, her plump and round breasts bouncing vigorously. I can clearly hear the slapping sounds in the video, mixed with lustful moans and grunts.  
  
""Yes, yes, f\*\*k me hard, Alpha,"" the woman screams ecstatically in response.  
  
""You naughty she-wolf!"" Alexander growls, his voice low and predatory. He stands up and flips her over, slapping her buttocks as he speaks. ""Stick your ass up!""  
  
The woman giggles, turns around, sways her buttocks, and kneels on the bed.  
  
I feel like someone has poured a bucket of ice water on my head. It's bad enough that my mate is having an affair, but what's worse is that the other woman is my own sister, Bella.  
  
I let the video play, watching and listening to the two of them having s\*x, my disgust being provoked time and time again. Every time I hear their moans, my heart feels like it's being stabbed.  
  
My wolf, Aria, growls inside my mind, her voice sharp and furious. 'How dare he betray you like this? He’s your mate!'  
  
I suppress Aria’s rage, forcing myself to stay calm.  
  
The cheating continues. After a few more slaps, he grabs her buttocks, thrusts his c\*\*k deep into her, and starts pounding vigorously.  
  
After a few more thrusts, Alexander and Bella moan together as they climax. They collapse on the bed, kissing .  
  
""Do you treat my sister like this in bed too?"" Bella's coquettish voice rings out, her tone dripping with mockery.   
  
""Don't mention her,"" Alexander's ruthless voice echoes through the video, his Alpha authority making his words cut deeper. ""I haven't even kissed her, she can't compare to you at all.""  
  
""I knew you only loved me!"" Bella smiles satisfied, hooking Alexander's neck, leans in to kiss him, and says, ""I want to do it again!""  
  
Seeing them rolling together again, I feel a wave of nausea and can't watch anymore. I angrily press the pause button, swallowing hard.  
  
I am very clear, this video must have been sent by Bella. She wants to tell me that she still holds  Alexander in her grip, and I am powerless against it. Apart from a mating bond and title,  Alexander and I don't resemble a mated pair at all. Bella indeed knows how to twist the knife further.  
  
Three years ago, My father, Michael, the Alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack, had made a disastrous investment that left our pack’s company bankrupt. The funding chain was broken, and he owed a massive debt to the pack. To salvage the situation, he had no choice but to arrange a marriage alliance with the Nightscar Pack. Alexander’s wealth and influence were the only lifeline left for our pack.  
  
On that fateful day I never imagined was going to begin the worst turning point of my life, all was made ready to celebrate the union of Bella and Alexander. It was only mere minutes to the mating ceremony when Bella disappeared (or at least found out she was gone). Bella was nowhere to be found.  
  
My parents, who were desperate to salvage the embarrassment and save face in front of the pack or whatever it was they were trying to protect that day, turned to me. They told me to put on my sister's ceremonial dress, to take Bella's place at the altar.  
  
There was no room for argument, neither was I given the choice to say no. I was to be the figurehead, the stand-in mate who'd fulfill the ceremony in Bella's absence. There were no words of blessing and no well-wishes for a happy future. Instead, all I received were instructions to “be a good Luna.”  
  
This was how it all started.  
  
I was left numb, standing there in the borrowed ceremonial dress to exchange vows with a man I barely knew. It felt as though my dreams and aspirations were suddenly overshadowed by the harsh reality of my circumstances. Like my life had been snatched away from me in an instant, and I barely recalled what happiness felt like after that day. I was constrained in every sense of the word.  
  
Did I say this was how it all started?  
  
No, I think it actually dated way back to when I was three and had unfortunately gone missing. For eighteen long years, I lived away from my pack and family. Growing older. As I grew older, from being a pup, to a young wolf, I kept searching for my roots again. And when my long-awaited dream of reuniting with my pack became reality, it was nothing like I'd expected.  
  
There was no joyous reunion, no tears of happiness.  
  
Instead, I was met with something close to indifference.  
  
As if I were a stranger who had wandered into their lives. My parents seemed to have moved on from me after all those years I was gone. All the love they had was for Bella; barely any left for me.  
  
I guess there was nothing left, in fact, because if there was, I would at least be pitied enough to have been told that Bella had returned from abroad and had somehow found her way into my mate's arms.  
  
Almost immediately, my phone buzzed with an incoming video call from Bella. I didn't want to answer it at first, but ended up swiping green. Bella's face popped up on the screen, sitting in the same room from the video with a towel wrapped around her body.  
  
""Hi, hope you're having a happy day over there,"" Bella chirped with a smug smile.  
  
She moved the phone's camera around to show more of the room, and in the background, I caught a faint glimpse of Alexander walking into the bathroom.  
  
""Guess who's going to die a pathetic old virgin? Not me!"" She laughed callously.  
  
I silently clenched my teeth. I was reeling with annoyance from the insult.  
  
""He doesn't deserve you,"" she added. ""He deserves better. And I'm what's perfect for him, darling.""  
  
There was no way I was going to listen to any more of that. I angrily ended the call and flung the phone to the bed, then burying my head in my hands.  
  
I'd had enough. I wasn't going to sit still and let myself be dragged to the ground like a piece of rag any longer.  
  
By the time Alexander would return to the house, it was already well into the night. I sat on the cold tiles of the living room, hanging my chin on my palm and nearly dozing off when I heard the sound of the front door clicking.That familiar musky scent of his filled the air, but beneath it, I could swear I caught the faint trace of Bella’s perfume.  
  
My eyes blinked open, and I raised my head, locking a blank gaze with his face. There was that brick-hard look on his face which he always had when I was around. To think of how he was grinning from ear-to-ear earlier with Bella.  
  
After our mating ceremony, everything I'd been told by my parents to do, I did. Both taking care of his pack,his daily life, and several other things that couldn't be counted, all for three years. It started happening frequently, that it became a ritual, like a dance of habit ingrained in my daily routine.  Alexander also accepted it without question. But not for one day did Alexander spare me as much as a second glance.  
  
My wolf, Aria, growled low in my mind, her voice sharp with resentment.   
  
""Three years, Sydney. Three years of giving everything, and for what? A title? You are Luna in name only, and even that title feels like a chain.""  
  
""I know, Aria,I'm tired—tired of living up to everyone else's expectations. I just want to be free.""  
  
Alexander shut the door behind him and began walking into his room. Treating me as usual like I was invisible, and for the first time, I spoke.  
  
""I want to break the mating bond.""  
  
He turned to face me, an incredulous look on his face.  
  
""What are you talking about?""  
  
""I don't want this title of Luna anymore,” I answered without mincing words.  
  
That day three years ago, when I stood in that white dress, and him in his tuxedo, a congregation of pack members behind us and the pack elder in front of us, I saw that calm look of restrained anger in his eyes when he saw that it was not Bella behind the veil, but me.  
  
I remember my chest tightening behind the ceremonial necklace I was wearing. The way his stare burned. How stupid and helpless I felt in that dress. How my parents smiled like they'd not just pushed me out there against my will and the pack cheered with probably no idea of what was going on.  
  
“You may now seal the bond,” the pack elder announced.  
  
Alexander leaned closer towards me, but not for a mark, he merely brushed his face past my cheek and spoke into my ear, “The only thing you can get is the title of Luna.""  
  
And that title is what I was giving back to him. I didn't want it anymore. I wished I'd never let myself take it in the first place. I'd let go of too much of myself and endured more than I needed to. It was the height of it already.  
  
“I want to break the mating bond, Alexander,” I repeated myself in case he didn't hear me the first time—even though I knew he'd heard me clearly.  
  
He stared at me with a frown before answering coldly, ""It's not up to you! I'm the Alpha, and I don't have time for this nonsense. Don't waste my time with such boring topics, or try to attract my attention!""  
  
How typical of him to believe that I was trying to get his attention. I hadn't attracted that so-called attention of his for over three years, and it's when I mention ""breaking the bond"" that he remembers it.  
  
The last thing I was going to do was argue or bicker with him.  
  
""I will have Beta Johnson send the mating bond dissolution papers to the The Elders council,"" was all I said, as calmly as I could muster.  
  
He didn't even say another word after that and just went through the door he'd been standing in front of, slamming it harshly behind him. My eyes lingered on the knob of the door a bit absentmindedly before I pulled the wedding ring off my finger and placed it on the table. Don't even ask why I had it on in the first place.  
  
I grabbed my suitcase, which I'd already had my things packed in, and headed out of the house.  
  
As I walked toward the gate, Beta Johnson suddenly appeared in front of me. He was strong and loyal to Alpha Alexander, but he never respected me.  
  
Johnson blocked my way, looking down at me with a cold smile. ""Luna Sydney,"" he said, his tone mocking. ""Where are you going? The Alpha Alexander didn’t mention you leaving.""  
  
I try to keep my voice calm. ""I’m leaving for a while.""  
  
""Leaving?"" Johnson laughed. ""Trying to get the Alpha’s attention? Don’t waste your time. He doesn’t care about you.""  
  
His words hurt. For years, Alexander had ignored me, and the pack followed his lead.   
  
""Let me pass,"" I said.  
  
Johnson didn’t move. ""You’re still the Luna. Without the Alpha’s permission, you can’t leave.""  
  
My heart ached, but I stood tall. ""Even if he ignores me, I’m still your Luna. You should listen to me.""  
  
For a moment, Johnson hesitated—then moved with a shrug, as if I wasn’t worth the effort.  
  
As I walked away, I heard him mutter: ""Pathetic. A Luna forgotten by her Alpha is worse than an omega.""  
  
I acted like I didn’t hear him. I didn’t care—not anymore.  
  
The wind outside felt different afterward, like a heavy burden was being lifted off my shoulders for the first time in a very long while. The feeling of the night breeze blowing through the strands of my hair was immaculate.  
  
Grabbing my phone from my purse and swiping my fingers quickly across the screen, I put the phone to my ear, hearing it ring.  
  
""I am done with Alexander, come pick me up.”  
  


# Chapter 2

SYDNEY'S POV  
  
The soft wind of the night continued to whip my hair to and fro while I stood outside with my suitcase next to me. I was already out of that house, finally.   
  
The flamboyant red sports car pulled over right in front of where I stood, and an even more flamboyant woman was in the driver's seat twiddling her fingers at me as she wound down the windows.  
  
It was Grace.  
  
Grace was not only my best friend, she was also my business partner and the daughter of the Alpha of the Nightbloom Pack, a small but fiercely independent pack on the borderlands. We've been inseparable since our college days. And because we both shared a passion for fashion, we both decided to turn our dreams into reality by co-founding Luxe Vogue, a fashion-forward online shopping website that quickly became a favorite among young trendsetters.  
  
Grace had a keen eye for design, so she was in charge of designing stunning clothing collections, while I focused on designing jewelry at our equally jointly-owned studio, Atelier. Atelier was a high-end fashion studio catering to elite clientele. Our business acumen and creative vision catapulted us into the world of high-ranking millionaires.  
  
I stepped into the passenger's seat of Grace's car, sighing and immediately clicking my seatbelt in.  
  
""Finally willing to leave that bastard and return to work?"" Grace quipped with a mischievous grin.  
  
""I really don't understand why you would waste three years of your life to take care of an asshole who doesn't love you at all.""  
  
I rolled my eyes, ""Because I was blind, but now I can see. ”  
  
Grace chuckled, starting the car. ""Well, I'm glad your eyes are wide open now. We've got a whole lot to run, we can't have you distracted by some guy who doesn't appreciate you.""  
  
I chuckled, resting my elbow tiredly on the car door. From the onset, Grace had always hated my marriage to Alexander. She had tried, in her way, to convey her disapproval, both indirectly and directly.I was glad we could finally freely talk and make jests about it.  
  
""So, where are we headed now?""  
  
""To the airport, of course. I've got a sudden urge for a short trip.""  
  
Grace leaned back in her seat, resting a hand on the car door while the other stayed on the steering wheel. ""Well, needed anyway.""  
  
""That reminds me,"" Grace said, ""A company is interested in buying the website. And I kid you not, it's an insane offer. I'm tempted.""  
  
""I'm really not in the mood for work right now. We'll talk about that when I return,"" I said, glancing at Grace. Grace nodded understandingly. ""Totally get it.”  
  
I really needed this trip, to get my mind out for a bit, to revel in my freedom from Alexander and the suffocating routine I had fallen into.   
  
Grace pulled into the airport. As the car came to a stop, I dialed a number.  
  
""I'm here now, where are you?"" I spoke first.   
  
Grace looked at me curiously. ""Who was that?"" she asked.  
  
""You'll see,"" I grinned cryptically.   
  
While we waited in the car, a man in a sharp suit approached the car. He was Asher, my trusted lawyer from the Shadowmoon Pack, who had helped me draft the formal request to dissolve the mate bond with Alexander.  
  
Asher opened his briefcase and took out an envelope containing the documents. “Here,” he handed me the papers. I glanced through them one after the other, feeling an overwhelming feeling of finality wash down on me.  
  
""Do you need some more time to go through them?"" Asher asked. I shook my head, determined. ""No, where do I sign?""  
  
He pointed to various areas on the pages, ""Here, here,"" flipping through them, ""over here and here,"" he directed. Then, he handed me a pen.  
  
I signed each page and spot that required my signature.  
  
""I'll have Alpha Alexander receive a copy as well and will send yours too,” he said as he placed the papers back in his briefcase.  
  
“You can have them sent to my mail.”  
  
“Will do,” he said.“Once the papers are signed, your mate bond dissolution request will be submitted to The Elders council. Provided there are no asset disputes, your mate bond will be officially severed within thirty business days”  
  
I nodded, “Thanks,” shaking his hand.  
  
""It's my duty,"" he replied, smiling.  
  
Grace looked at me, ""So, are you going to kill my curiosity now?""  
  
I looked at her and replied, ""That was Asher from the Shadowmoon Pack. I signed the formal request to dissolve the mate bond with Alexander.Everything will be easier if I give up my share of the pack's wealth""  
  
Grace let out a dramatic scream, ""Are you crazy? You're actually giving up on asking him for compensation? He's the Alpha of the Nightscar Pack, you could get a hundred million in assets!""  
  
I chuckled bitterly, ""It doesn't matter. I just want to dissolve this bond as soon as possible! I'm a successful businesswoman by myself,I don't need him to raise my value.""  
  
Grace shook her head, ""But still, a hundred million…” she looked so pained, so much so I nearly chuckled.  
  
I shrugged, ""Let him keep his wealth to himself, I just want to move on with my life.""  
  
“Aww, girl. I totally get it.” Grace reached out and squeezed my hand, ""I'm here for you, no matter what.""  
  
""And that's all that matters to me,"" I smiled and squeezed her hand in return.   
  
""Alright, let's get your things,"" she said, getting out of the car to help me pull my suitcase from the backseat and raising the handle tall.  
  
""Tell all the eligible Alphas, the Queen is back!"" I announced loudly into the wind.  
  
""Woo-hoo! The Queen is back, everyone!"" Grace hooted after me.  
  
Alexander’s POV  
  
I pulled into the driveway of the house, exhausted. Another long day of managing both the pack and the GT Group had left me drained, and all I wanted was to unwind and relax. I stepped out of the car and loosened the collar of my shirt, eager to get inside and finally relax. When I entered the house, I saw Sydney sitting there, staring at me with her usual blank look. I barely spared her a glance while heading straight for my study.  
  
""I want to break the mating bond,"" Sydney said before I could even reach the sanctuary of my study.  
  
Breaking the mating bond?After I returned home from a long day of exhausting work, I heard my Luna wants to break our mate bond? Ridiculous was the first word that came to my mind, and ridiculous it was indeed. The Shadowmoon Pack, Sydney's pack, had formed an alliance with the Nightscar Pack through our mating bond. As part of the agreement, Sydney's family's company merged with the GT Group, which I owned. This was a contract that benefited both parties in every sense of the word. Sydney was only a woman I'd married, who depended on her parents and me for survival.  
  
Breaking the mating bond, huh? It was obviously her new way of crying for attention, like she was fond of doing. It used to be the pitiful demeanor she carried around her, which was enough to convince an outsider that she was being treated wrongly, even though that had never been the case. We'd been keeping up the mated couple facade for three years already.  
  
Now she was pulling a new stunt, which I wasn't going to fall for.  
  
The next morning, I entered the dining room to have breakfast before leaving, but all I was met with was an empty table.   
  
Every morning Sydney would be here preparing breakfast, but now no steaming coffee, no fresh pastries.  
  
she was nowhere to be seen.",1,1746772091.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

The length of the cable is also critically important; too short, and it might potentially be tough to secure your laptop to a stable object.

The lock head should also be low-profile to minimize the risk of it being snapped off.

High-quality combination locks with multiple dials and anti-pick features can be just as secure as keyed locks.Though, keyed locks may offer a higher level of security in certain specific cases, especially if they use advanced key designs or restricted keyways.

**Can a steadfast thief bypass a laptop lock?**

So we went. And to our surprise, we loved every second of it. The laughter, the stories, the break from our daily worries it was beautiful. Now that it’s over, there’s this odd ache. We keep replaying the moments in our minds, wishing we could go back, or at least pause that joy a little longer.

And it makes me think maybe my neighbor has it all figured out. She didn’t go, didn’t make memories, and now she doesn’t have to miss anything either. Maybe there’s a kind of peace in that.",1,1746771856.0,u_writerfromolympus,0,1.0,False

The colour is quite light as you can see on my skin swatch, with subtle glitter. It’s not as obvious in real life. I do like how it’s easy to apply with the creaminess of the eyeshadow but the packaging doesn’t make it easy to carry around. 

I love the liquid lipstick. It actually look dark when apply on forearm but it comes out almost mauve-pink/purple when applied on my lips. The shade I bought was Dawn Rose. I love the smell of the subtle rose, I knowr how people don’t like fragrance in their makeup but if I’m putting it on - I want a nicer fragrance rather than chemical smell.
