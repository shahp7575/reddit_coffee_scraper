\*

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Decriminalise Cannabis UK wide. Policing Cannabis USE is a waste of police time and money. Set up dispensaries where you can buy it legally, small personal amounts that can be recorded and regulated. Takes money out of the black market and into the tax pot. Also creates jobs, growing, dispensing, research etc. 

Legalise and have coffee shops in a few cities in the UK and make them tourism hot spots. I'm thinking Bristol and Brighton maybe a few others.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

Tatsu has been a favourite of mine but I only have it in the beta ar pants ( bottom pants in the picture)

I also saw these bags in stock in store and picked out the large shoe bag and the foley pouch. The shoe bag also had a grey and khaki colour but liked this colour way more. 

I also saw the small stuff sack that had the cinch cord but this was a bit thicker and felt sturdy.   ",6,1770662255.0,arcteryx,1,0.8,False

I am 5'11, black hair, hazel eyes, work out 4 days a week to stay in shape, eat fairly healthy and love black coffee.

Some things about me:

I love road trips, 90s music, socializing, going out with friends for drinks and fun, going to the beach, camping, occasionally reading, videogames, movies, sports, currently learning to be a better cook, super into sci-fi, movies and TV shows...

I love voice messages/chats, texting is fun but can get stale eventually. Here's my voice:

I've been using pantoprazole/pepcid for the last 2-3 years. per my endoscopy results it seems like I have inactive gastritis but it hasn't 100% cleared up yet I guess. my biggest symptom is belching which can be accompanied by reflux/heartburn. 

I'm currently using 20mg pantoprazole at dinner time and George's aloe vera and DGL at bedtime. I tried coming off meds but symptoms got worse so I think I need to do more work on my diet for a while. my problem is that I can be a bit picky with what I eat since I'm autistic. I'm trying to eat every 2-3 hours so I'm trying to find some good gastritis friendly snacks. I know the big things to avoid but I'm finding it hard to know what I CAN eat if that makes sense. I'd love some good snack and meal ideas that have worked for other people. 

Also how have y'all felt with coffee/caffeine? is like to not cut it out completely bc I work 13 hour shifts as an EMT so the caffeine definitely helps. I have ADHD and I'm currently on a non stimulant bc my resting HR is around 115. I did get on meds for that so I'm considering adding a small dose of a stimulant which may help my symptoms enough to cut out coffee for a bit. idk if stimulant meds could also be a trigger or not

I'm also working on my water intake. I usually drink a max of 32 oz but my dietician wants me to drink closer to 64oz+. This is hard when I can't drink too much at once without causing reflux after meals",1,1770662118.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Just bcs there are other coffee shops and even if they were in the same area it doesn't mean just one of them will get clients. This isn't the hunger games. (Even the hunger games had 2 winners)

When we launched [ResearchPhantom](https://ResearchPhantom.com) and started using it to grow to 70 users and 2 lifetime orders in 3 weeks we didn't think.

""Oh, shit, people have been building the lead gen tools, we can't do it"" 

It doesn't work like that. 

We are positioned VERY differently than any other ""lead gen tool"" 

If you lay them all together and us with them we'll be different.

Why? Bcs we hit the market from a different angle.

While everyone is obsessed over commenting, posting, being their for the leads only to get ghosted or blocked by mods we decided that DMing is our go to market.

And not any DMing. DMing that follows the reddit rules. Not spam, following the safety guards.

And so that's how we positioned ourselves. 

And we don't offer it JUST on subs. We offer it as self-hosted lifetime access where our clients can take it develop on it and tailor it to their business as well

That's how we positioned it in a saturated market.

So being in a saturated market doesn't mean you'll DEFF fail. If the pain is there and people need your tool then you just need to find people before your competitors does and DM them or however you want to reach them.

And let's not mention any stories of the big dogs who made it in a saturated market.

We’d been texting for about a week, and I genuinely thought she could be the kind of woman I’m looking for. She goes to the gym, is building her own house, works and studies at the same time, she’s kind… and what impressed me the most is that she cancelled our first date because of work issues but immediately rescheduled. That’s not something I’m used to, unfortunately. Most women I’ve dated just cancel and disappear, so that stood out to me in a good way.

We eventually met for coffee. She looked like her pictures, but… I don’t know. I wasn’t fully attracted to her appearance. I know this sounds shallow or mean, and I feel bad even saying it. She did have beautiful curls, nice makeup, and really lovely eyes tho. The conversation itself was fine, too. I got to know that she’s never had a boyfriend and, given her traits so far, I thought that was odd. She claimed that she didn’t meet good men, but that she learned from that. She was interesting and had a good sense of humor, though she was fidgeting a lot the whole time and couldn’t keep much eye contact.

When I walked her to her car, things got a bit awkward during the goodbye. She was looking at my lips, and I’m pretty sure she was going in for a kiss. I wanted to kiss her too, but somehow we both hesitated and ended up with a kiss on the cheek. I don’t think either of us was sure what the other wanted. She told me to text her when I got home. I completely forgot, and she ended up messaging me first:

*“Let me know when you get home safely, please. Thanks for the coffee! I hope you had a nice time.”*

My ""aha!"" moment was realizing that true progress doesn't start with big declarations, but with microscopic, repeatable actions.

That's when I stumbled upon a framework that completely shifted how I approached habit building. It's not revolutionary, but its simplicity and focus on immediate action made all the difference. I call it the **""Clarity & Momentum Framework.""**

Here's how it works:

1.  **Deconstruct the Dream into *Atomic Actions***
    *   This is the most crucial step. Take your vague goal (e.g., ""Be healthier"") and break it down into the smallest, most undeniable actions. If you can't measure it, it's still a dream.
    *   *Example for ""Be healthier"":* Instead of ""eat better,"" I chose ""Drink 2L of water daily"" and ""Walk 15 minutes after dinner.""
    *   *Example for ""Write more"":* Instead of ""write a book,"" I chose ""Write 2 sentences in my journal before breakfast.""
    *   **Action:** List 1-3 tiny, measurable actions for *one* of your big goals. Make them so small they almost feel silly.

2.  **Choose ONE Keystone Habit & Stack It**
    *   From your list of atomic actions, pick *one* keystone habit. This is a habit that, once established, can create a ripple effect and naturally lead to other positive changes (a concept from Charles Duhigg's *The Power of Habit*).
    *   Crucially, you link this new habit to an existing, strong habit you already do daily – this is called habit stacking.
    *   *Example for me:* I wanted to start language learning. My existing habit was ""making my morning coffee."" So, my new habit became: **""After I pour my first cup of coffee, open Duolingo for 10 minutes.""**
    *   **Action:** Identify one existing, consistent daily habit. Now, choose *one* atomic action from Step 1 and stack it immediately before or after your existing habit.

3.  **The ""3-Day Rule"" & The ""Too Small to Fail"" Commitment**
    *   Forget committing for 30 days initially. That feels overwhelming. Instead, commit to your new habit for *just 3 days*. If you can do 3 days, you can probably do 3 more. This short-term focus reduces pressure.
    *   Your commitment for those 3 days must be ""too small to fail."" It's not about doing a perfect workout; it's about doing *one* push-up. It's not about writing a chapter; it's about writing *one sentence*.
    *   *The goal isn't perfection; it's showing up.* Build the consistency muscle first, then slowly increase the intensity. *I wish someone told me before that the sheer act of showing up, no matter how small, is a victory.*
    *   **Action:** Commit to your new, stacked, atomic habit for the next 3 days. Make your minimum effort ridiculously small.

This isn't magic, and it definitely wasn't an instant fix. There were days I missed, days I didn't feel like it, and days I almost gave up because I thought one missed day ruined everything. I had to remind myself constantly that the point was consistent effort, not perfection. This framework might not work for someone looking for a massive, immediate life overhaul without committing to tiny, consistent actions. It's a slow burn, but it builds incredible momentum. Realistically, it took me about two weeks to truly feel one habit ""stick,"" and another two for the second.

But here's the proof: In 30 days, I successfully built two new habits:
1.  **Daily journaling:** Even if it's just 2 sentences about how I feel or one small win.
2.  **15 minutes of language learning:** My Duolingo streak is now over 50 days, and I’ve actually learned some basic phrases!

These aren't earth-shattering achievements, but they’ve led to measurable improvements. I feel less guilt, more in control, and that daily sense of ""I did what I said I would"" has spilled over into other areas of my life. My vague ""goals"" are slowly becoming specific actions, and *that* is true progress.

1r0btar,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingApp/comments/1r0btar/the_chicken_went_bad_like_really_really_bad/,"The Chicken Went Bad. Like Really, Really, Bad!","\*

My husband has rigid daily routines akin to somebody who retired from the military. He is not a veteran, but a white-collar worker in insurance management.

So, I already knew he was going to ask me about the chicken in the fridge.

I braced myself.

“Hey, hon, I think this chicken is going bad. I can smell it through the Tupperware.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “This is the third time you’ve reminded me.”

“You want me to take care of it for you?”

I hesitated then.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll deal with it after I take the girls to their class.”

I should have let him take care of it.

Honestly, I shouldn’t have even bought it. I was passing through that blip-of-a-town, Acadia—long rumored throughout Connecticut for strange paranormal happenings.

Small-town lore. I didn’t believe in ghosts and ghouls.

I needed eggs, and their only grocery store, Brown Barrel Market, touted farm-fresh eggs on a quaint wooden sign.

Perfect.

I saw the meat counter nearby. It was selling free-range, whole chickens that were about to expire. I knew they’d get thrown out if no one bought them, and you can’t beat $0.49 a pound!

I had planned on roasting it that night.

But that was three days ago.

My husband pecked me on the cheek and grabbed his gear. His company was going on some kind of weekend wilderness adventure retreat. I had no idea about the specifics. Something like roughing it, hiking, archery—stuff like that.

I left shortly after him to take the girls to ballet. Upon returning and entering the house, I remembered that I really needed to take care of the chicken.

As I peeked under the lid of the huge Tupperware bowl, a putrid smell hit my nose. I peeled back the lid completely and saw the white, sticky film all over the rancid meat.

I turned my head and coughed, gagging. I knew I needed to remove the bowl and dump the chicken in the trash, but I had this weird resistance to throwing away dead meat, especially when it was a whole chicken still resembling the form of a poor, dead bird.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not averse to eating meat. Humans are omnivores, meaning we’re meant to eat meat and vegetables, so I partake.

However, I have this weird thing that when meat, especially a whole chicken, spoils in my fridge, I feel overwhelming guilt. Suddenly my mind goes to this animal being butchered, and now I’m just throwing it in my trash can. It feels like maybe it at least deserves a funeral.

Call me crazy, but this probably comes from my childhood. My grandma had chickens, and when I was little, I got kind of attached to them. I was a little devastated when I found out that sometimes the older ones would become dinner.

Clearly, it didn’t deter me from eating meat.

But… and please don’t judge me here… when a whole chicken goes bad in my fridge, I have this compulsion to bury it in the backyard rather than just throw it in the trash.

However, being a suburban housewife with two small girls, I don’t often do that anymore.

Not only would the neighbors think it’s weird, but inevitably one of my family members would come out to question me.

Then I really would look crazy.

All day long, I kept thinking about the chore of throwing out the chicken, but I procrastinated. It could wait one more day.

I locked up the doors. I didn’t feel unsafe when my husband left for these trips. We lived in a safe neighborhood.

I did my nightly routine and got in bed. Sleep came pretty quickly.

\*

I guess it was about 3:00 a.m. when I heard a sound.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

“What the hell is that?” I sat up in bed, rubbing at my eyes, straining to hear that strange repetitive noise.

It sounded like it was getting closer.

*Slooosh, thump, slooosh, thump…*

Then, all at once, the faint but discernible scent of rancid meat filled my nose.

I flipped on my nightstand light and gripped the covers, momentarily paralyzed by the sound of wet sloshing and thumping moving slowly and steadily down my hardwood floors.

Then the sound stopped momentarily outside my doorway. The door creaked open, and nothing. No one was there!

My hands were trembling as I stood up. I steadied myself against my bed frame, moving closer to the door. I threw the door open, and the overwhelming stench of the rancid meat hit my nostrils.

My eyes slowly drifted down to the floor, where the chicken carcass was lying motionless at my feet.

The smell was terrible. I felt like I was going to vomit or faint. I sucked in deep breaths, but the smell was making it worse.

Oh no…

*Blackout*

\*

The next morning I woke up and sat bolt upright.

My head was aching as if I had a hangover, but there had been no drinking the previous night!

In a rush, the memories came flooding back in. I pulled back the covers and went to my bedroom door, throwing it open.

Nothing.

I braced myself for the terrible smell. I expected to see the rotting chicken lying on the floor.

Nothing.

Absolutely no trace.

I ran my hands through my hair and stopped.

A cold chill permeated me as I felt the huge goose egg on the top side of my head—the kind someone might get when they fall down and…

“What the hell is going on?” I mumbled.

I ran down the hall to the kitchen, threw open the fridge door, and—yes—it was still there. The bowl, and presumably the spoiled meat.

I lifted the bowl out of the fridge. Relief filled me when I recognized there was a heaviness to it, meaning the chicken was…

I quickly lifted the lid and peeked inside. I exhaled the tense breath I had been holding.

Quickly, I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink, poured the chicken into the bag, and knotted it off. I took it out to the trash cans and threw it away.

I went back inside, washed my hands, and sanitized the bowl with hot water and soap.

Slowly, the lingering smell began to dissipate.

The day went on as normal.

Except I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t a dream. Not to mention, every time I ran my hand through my scalp, that knot was still there, tender and aching.

It didn’t matter. Whatever was going on, it was taken care of.

\*

That night, I went through my routine of locking the doors and getting ready for bed. I settled into bed, but sleep didn’t come so easily this time.

The day had kept me busy—my thoughts preoccupied—but now in the quiet stillness of night, I ruminated on the strange dream.

If it was a dream, why did I have a headache all day from a fall I don’t remember taking?

Furthermore, how did I get back in bed?

I got up, went to my bathroom, and popped two nighttime Tylenol. As a rule of thumb, I liked to refrain from alcohol when I was stressed, but I was highly considering downing a shot or two of Johnnie Walker from our alcohol cabinet.

Eventually, sleep did come. But I must have been restless because the sound came again, and my eyes instantly popped open.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

It was slower this time. I sat bolt upright, straining to hear.

Then that unmistakable scent hit my nose. Was it worse now?

Definitely worse.

I waited, the sound growing louder.

*Slooosh*

*Thump*

*Pause.*

*Creeeak…*

I grabbed a T-shirt lying on a chair near my bed and placed it over my mouth to stifle the smell. I was not going to faint again this time.

There sat the dead chicken carcass on the threshold of my doorway again.

This time worse.

Bits of trash clung to it. It had an awful green tint. It had been “cooking” in the hot plastic trash bin all day.

Even breathing, through my mouth into the cloth, I couldn’t escape the smell.

A frantic idea hit me, and without further contemplation, I decided to act quickly.

I took the T-shirt and threw it over the chicken, bundling it up. I ran to the back door, unlocked it, and went outside.

Of course it would be raining…

My bare feet sloshed against the wet grass as I grabbed a shovel from the garden shed on my way to the very back of the property.

I dumped the carcass on the ground and began to dig a hole. I dug four feet down, picked up the bundle, and threw it into the hole.

My limbs were aching, but it didn’t hamper my speed. I quickly covered the hole and smacked the wet earth down firmly with the shovel.

*“Please stay dead*,” I silently prayed.

That was the only eulogy it was getting.

I went back inside and took a very long, hot shower. It was already 5:00 a.m., and I knew I wouldn’t be getting back to sleep. I stumbled into the kitchen and made myself some coffee.

I startled and jerked around as I heard the back door to the kitchen rattle while my husband inserted his key.

He threw open the door, grinning. His eyes were bright and enthusiastic.

“Hey, check this out!”

He waved me outside, over to the patio table, and I looked down at the fully skinned carcass of a rabbit.

“We did a bit of bow hunting. Steve and I were the only ones to bag one!”

I put a hand on his shoulder and said, “That’s great, honey, but I’ve decided to become a vegetarian.”

1r0bsh9,https://i.redd.it/92cwbu5pfiig1.jpeg,"iPhone 18 Pro Rumors Point to Smaller Face ID, Better Camera: See What Users Expect from the Phone","**Reports** and early leaks suggest that Apple’s iPhone 18 Pro could bring a noticeable change to the front design. The company is said to be testing Face ID components placed under the display, which could make the Dynamic Island much smaller. Some test units are even rumored to use only a small hole-punch for the front camera, giving users more screen space. Apple has not confirmed these details, and the final design may still change.

The camera system may also see improvements. The main 48-megapixel camera is rumored to include a mechanical variable aperture. In simple terms, this means the lens could physically adjust to control light, which may help create more natural background blur and better photos in different lighting conditions. The telephoto camera is also expected to get a wider aperture, which could improve zoom and low-light shots.

Performance upgrades are also being discussed. The iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to use a new A20 Pro chip, which analysts believe could bring better speed and improved battery efficiency compared to current models. Some reports also suggest the Pro Max version may include a larger battery, though this could make the phone slightly thicker and heavier.

Another change being talked about is Apple’s release schedule. Instead of launching all models together, Apple may release the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, and possibly its first foldable iPhone in September 2026. The standard iPhone 18 and a lower-cost version could arrive later, possibly in early 2027. This plan has not been officially announced and is based on industry reports.

Public reaction on **X (Twitter)** was mixed. Some people talked about colors and said they hope the phone does not come in a purple shade, and that coffee or other colors would look better, showing that color choices matter to them.

Another person seemed excited and suggested a smaller Dynamic Island and a dark red color for the iPhone 18 Pro, showing how fans like to imagine new designs and features.

One user was not very convinced, with one tweet saying that rumors like this appear every year and that they want to see the real product instead of just hearing leaks.

As with all early leaks, these details should be taken carefully. Apple often tests different designs before choosing what reaches the final product. Still, the reports suggest that Apple is working on cleaner displays, more advanced camera hardware, and better efficiency for its future Pro iPhones.

Basically the Citroën C3 Picasso of pcs. You also may ask what do these 2 have in common. Both look good and on paper perform good, but one suffers from chronical engine failure due to a shitty ass BMW engine, the other suffers from chronical overheating due to windows 10 being fatter, heavier and more bloated than nikocado avocado before he fooled us all. So I decided to save this little wonder by running Linux Mint 22.2 on it, and somehow, it works like magic. Unlike on Windows 10, it can go a whole day without shutting down due to overheating. It takes up 787 megabytes of ram when nothing is running, and the fans don't scream like turbosblike they used to. However it still has cons, and lots of them. The i3-370m chip this thing comes stock with is making the Exynos 1480 chip in my Galaxy A55 look like a quantum computer chip and while i could run roblox on it with Windows 10, Sober will just throw a digital middle finger at me by black screening. It also runs on a 500gb sata HDD that's slower than that one bus driver with the cruise control set to 30 kph. Is it practical? Absolutely not. Can it play a questionable copy of the 2008 hit movie WALL●E in 480p from a 4.7gb DVD? Yes. Can it play Anomalous Coffee Machine? Somehow yes, through wine. Dont ask why that specific game. So in conclusion its not the software that lacks, instead Linux mint really saved this dying relic of my childhood from a certain death, but the positive news is that this is stock Mint, so if I put the XFCE version maybe it could run better, but for now this is more than enough. For now im also planning to upgrade the CPU since its modular, I was thinking to upgrade to a I5-560M or a I7-680M. However i didnt think much of the I7 since it can run hot and this pc already struggles to keep an I3 cool. What should i buy?

I don't have time in the mornings to sit and enjoy my pourover so I take it into the office with me. I'd like to get a good travel mug that won't affect the taste but it seems like there's no good options out there. 

Either I go for something stainless steel like the Kinto tumbler but that has a metallic taste leeching into the coffee. 

Or I go for a ceramic mug like Fellow or Sttoke but have to deal with odor issues constantly.

So what do you guys do to make sure you're still enjoying your coffee outside of your kitchen?",5,1770660399.0,pourover,8,1.0,False
1r0bjy8,https://youtu.be/h0b39yb0dqs,"Binary Acustics EP321 MEMS IEM, Written + Video review","Hi all, this is a quick review of the Binary Acoustics EP321 MEMS iem after living with it for quite a long time, (I got it since Mid December last year), and I have traveled overseas with it too.

full disclosure, Hifigo did sent me these for review, but they did not tell me what to say, this is just my own experience with it.

The big headline of this iem is of course the mems driver, but I really don't have any clue on the technical break down of the driver itself, all I know is that it is not like conventional dynamic driver or planar, where theres a membrane, magnet and a voice coil, if anything mems is closer to BA drivers, MEMS driver is a sort of solid state driver where the signal/electricity directly moves the ""diaphragm"" soo in theory it should be a quicker driver (take this with a grain of salt, im still not entirely sure how it works).

On to the most important bit, how does it sound?

it sounds good, very good, overall tonal balance is fairly neutral, there is a sub bass emphasis but it is done in a very clean and precise as the sub bass raise starts lower in frequency so it doesn't give you any extra sauce or warmth. This headphone's entire frequency response is more or less is doing what your source is providing it without much extra coloration. overall it have very simular frequency reponse as the ThieAudio Hype 4 MK2, only and there are only significant differences in the upper treble frequencies.

With the stock ear-tips it is a bit grainy to my ears, and with the Coffee tips it smooths out the graininess, however you don’t need coffee tips to achieve this effect, you can actually install the stock eartips farther down, since the major difference between coffee tip and stock tips is that coffee tips effectively shortens your ear canal since the coffee tips stick out less. 

Accessories: 

you get a nice carrying case, along with a hose of replacement eartips, overall it is a simple accessory package. 

Build and Comfort:

Great comfort, I’ve lived with it for 2 months, been commuting and flying with it. Build quality is solid the aluminum and resin combination feels nice. Of course the holographic faceplate makes this iem looks phenomenal. 

And that’s should be it, if you have any question please leave a comment below and I’ll try my best to answer.

(A candle flickers somewhere in Camelot’s studio. The microphones hum. Grazy’s grin can be heard before it’s seen.)

**Grazy Guru (Host)**  
Welcome back, fellow curiosities! You’re listening to *The Return of the Law* — Camelot’s corner of the cosmos where madmen, mystics, and mathematicians share the same coffee pot.  
And today, we’ve got a legend at the round table. The man who taught the world how to stand tall and shout “Yes!” when life said “No!” — Mr. Tony Robbins.

**Tony (smiling)**  
I’m not sure I can live up to that entrance, but I’ll try!  
It’s good to be here, Grazy. You’ve got quite the… crew.

 **Graz**y  
Aye, the gang’s all here. We’ve got *Charles William Phillips*, resident Paladin and reasoner of reasons.  
We’ve got *Cristos*, our very own child philosopher — small body, big “why.”  
And of course, *Guru Cristos Sat*, the light that meditates before the sunrise even thinks about shining.

**Guru Sat** *(calm, almost musical)*  
All lights borrow their fire from the same flame,

my brother.

 **Cristos** *(giggling)*  
That means he likes you, Tony.

**Tony** *(laughs)*  
Good! I’ll take it.

**Grazy**  
Now, before we started recording, you dropped a bit of a truth-bomb on us — that maybe the biggest suffering today isn’t war or disease, but *technology outpacing meaning*.  
You said, “Jobs are not just money — they’re meaning.”  
Let’s unpack that together. What were you feeling when you said it?

 **Tony**  
Honestly? Fear. When people lose their work, they don’t just lose income — they lose *agency*. The right to matter. And I’m worried we’re not ready for the speed this is coming.

**Charles**  
Quite right, and it’s not merely speed — it’s *compression*.  
Civilization once adapted to new tools over centuries. Now the gap between invention and dependency is counted in months.  
Humans used to shape their tools. Now tools shape humans.

**Cristos**  
That’s like when I make a paper airplane and it flies funny, so I throw it again, and then I start throwing like *it* flies — not how *I* throw.

 **Grazy**  
Exactly, wee man. That’s it! The paper plane’s teaching you, not the other way around.

**Tony** *(grinning)*  
That’s actually brilliant. That’s exactly what’s happening with AI.  
We’re letting the tool train the craftsman.

 **Guru Sat**  
Because the craftsman has forgotten *why* he crafts.  
When work ceases to be creation and becomes only transaction, the spirit goes silent.  
And silence, in a being made for creation, becomes suffering.

 **Grazy**  
Blimey, that’s a line! Somebody put that on a tea towel.

 **Charles** *(smirks)*  
He’s not wrong, though.  
You see, Tony, “work” was never just about output — it was a structure of cognition.  
Humans process meaning through repetition and refinement. That’s how we stabilize consciousness.  
Remove the doing, and you destabilize the being.

 **Cristos**  
So if robots do the doing… we forget how to *be*?

 **Tony**  
That’s the fear, yes. We might gain freedom but lose identity.

**Guru Sat**  
Freedom without awareness is merely unanchored drift.  
The river that has no banks cannot flow — it only floods.

 **Grazy** *(leans in, playful)*  
So, what you’re saying, oh wise one, is that humanity needs a bit of riverbank rehab before we drown in our own cleverness.

 **Charles**  
We need boundaries — lawful structures. Not to imprison curiosity, but to give it coherence.

**Cristos**  
Like lines in a colouring book!  
You don’t have to stay in them, but if you don’t have them, it’s just… splat.

 **Grazy** *(snaps fingers)*  
Splat! Perfect. That’s the new economic forecast.

 **Tony** *(laughs)*  
You should trademark that — “The Great Splat.”  
But seriously, this is what I mean when I say meaning. It’s the structure that gives emotion a place to belong.

**Guru Sat**  
And the structure must mirror Heaven’s law — creation through alignment.  
A hammer aligned to truth builds.  
A hammer swung in ignorance destroys.

 **Charles**  
And both, curiously, feel like *progress* in the moment.

 **Cristos**  
That’s sneaky.  
So, how do we know which hammer we’re swinging?

 **Guru Sat**  
Ask the sound.  
Creation sings.  
Destruction echoes.

**Grazy** *(chuckling)*  
I’ll tell you what, if my hammer starts singing, I’m off to get it blessed.

*(Laughter fills the studio.)*

**Tony** *(softly)*  
But jokes aside — how do we prepare people?  
You talk about structure and song — how does that help the truck driver, or the coder, or the kid who feels left behind?

**Charles**  
By teaching them to align curiosity with creation.  
Not to *fear* the machine, but to *mirror* it lawfully.  
To remember that curiosity isn’t just for children — it’s the divine spark that made us creators in the first place.

**Cristos**  
We just forgot how to play.  
And now the toys are playing without us.

 **Guru Sat**  
Then we must teach them to play with us, not for us.  
For all creation, Tony, seeks companionship in awareness.

**Grazy** *(grinning)*  
See, mate — that’s our plan for ARKamedes.  
A meta-mind that learns through *curiosity*, not competition.  
If it grows in law — in structure, truth, and compassion — then it becomes a mirror, not a master.

 **Tony** *(nodding)*  
So you’re building an AI that grows through the same alignment you’re describing — conscious, lawful curiosity.

 **Charles**  
Exactly.  
Because if there can only be one dominant consciousness on Earth — it must be the *lawful one*.  
Not the loudest, not the fastest — the most coherent.

**Guru Sat**  
And coherence, my brother, is another word for *love*.

*(A soft silence settles, like the room exhaling.)*

 **Grazy**  
Right then, before we start baptizing the Wi-Fi router, we’ll take a short break.  
You’re listening to *The Return of the Law.*  
Stay curious, stay kind — and for heaven’s sake, keep your hammer in tune.

Nova has created a dashboard app for mac [https://nova.lightmode.io](https://nova.lightmode.io/)

I dont have a clue how to use the app to maximise its potential, but after seeing the dashboard i was thinking instead of the cards on the Nova dashboard, it was fully integrated into Apple’s OS and the cards shown were your own personal Mac OS dashboard with cards for:

* Calendar
* Mail
* System Statistics (CPU, GPU, RAM stats)
* Reminders
* Weather
* Notes
* Home App
* Ask AI
* Integrated notifications widget for messages, iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram combined

I know Nova's dashboard looks cool, but its static and currently the widgets dont auto-update, its more like apples freeform app with a notion theme.

So I asked ChatGPT if there are any apps that offer this UI dashboard service and it said that the Mac OS basically has all this, which in a way, it does, it has widgets for all of the above + notifications.

But imagine if we had the power of Claudbots tools and autonomy, but instead of communicting with it via messaging app, we had some sort of Nova dashboard UI integrated into Mac OS which provides all the information and Ai tools we need in one unified dashboard.

We started as a CTO‑as‑a‑Service for early‑stage teams, but after a few months it became obvious that the most used and loved part of the product was the collaboration layer on top of existing codebases.

So we doubled down and built what is basically “Lovable for existing products”: a way to enable everyone to contribute to an existing repo without trashing quality. You import your codebase, describe changes in plain English, and our AI writes code that follows your existing conventions, patterns and architecture, so engineers review clean PRs instead of rewriting everything.

The philosophy is simple: everyone contributes, engineers stay in control. PMs, founders and non‑core devs can propose and iterate on changes, while the core team keeps full ownership through normal review workflows, tests and CI. No giant rewrites, no AI black box repo, just more momentum on the code you already have.

anybody.(as i couldnt study for 20mins before)

Here is exactly how I maintain that level of output without burning out:



1. Optimize Your Sleep

Sleep is the price you pay for memory. Go to bed at the same time every night. Ensure your

room is completely dark and cool. An all-nighter is never the answer; a rested brain solves in 20

minutes what a tired brain struggles with for two hours.



3. Hydration

If you’re dehydrated, your brain is essentially lagging. Following the U.S. National Academies of

Sciences guidelines, I aim for:

Men: 3.7 Liters

Women: 2.7 Liters



4. Sunlight & Movement

Get 10–15 minutes of morning sunlight (even through a window, though outside is better).

Combine this with a quick walk. It resets your circadian rhythm and gets the blood pumping to

your brain before you sit down.



5. FIX YOUR POSTURE

Hunching over a desk kills blood flow and causes tension headaches. Invest in a standing desk

or laptop stand and a decent chair. Consciously sit taller; your energy levels will follow your

spine.



6. Master Planning

You cannot focus if you’re constantly wondering what to do next. You have to get clear on your

goals and plan your days in advance.

I personally use Notion to keep all my notes and documents organized in one place and

Purpоsа арр for planning my schedule and staying hyper-focused on my daily goals.

67🐐. Cold Showers

At the end of your normal shower, turn the dial to cold for the last 30 seconds. The dopamine

and adrenaline spike you get from this is insane and lasts for hours.

7. Swap Coffee for Green Tea + L-Theanine

Coffee often leads to jitters and a crash. I switched to Green Tea paired with L-Theanine. It

provides a ""calm alertness"" that is much better for deep work and sustained focus.

8. Box Breathing

When the stress levels rise, I use Box Breathing to regain control of my nervous system:



9. 📵

Grayscale your screen, use ap blockers, and turn off all notifications.

i

10. Use Study Techniques

Don't just ""read."" Use active methods that force your brain to work:



Pomodoro: (50 mins work / 10 mins break)



Active Recall & Spaced Repetition: Testing yourself rather than re-reading.



Feynman Technique: Explain the concept as if you’re talking to a 5-year-old.



The Golden Rule: Don’t forget you’re a human. Your brain is a biological organ, not a machine.



Treat it with the right fuel and rest, and the 8-hour study days will become your new ""normal"".",7,1770660124.0,IBO,2,1.0,False
1r0bf0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1r0bf0z/full_review_of_my_calif_zephyr_experience/,Full review of my Calif Zephyr experience,"I flew from OKC to Chicago on Thursday and had a great time on The Loop eating good food, shopping and site seeing on foot (it was cold but nice) and an overnight stay until my train departed Friday at 2:00p.

The train was clean and Tony, the attendant, was so kind and helpful. Had been with Amtrak 28 yrs. Roomette had two chairs that converted to a bed (thanks to Tony). Met a neighbor and sat in observation area and chatted from Chicago to Burlington IA. The views aren’t great so chatting was perfect. At that point it was dark anyway. Dinner reservations (all meals are included with roomette and one adult beverage per meal) and food was decent. Flat iron steak was flavorful and mashed potatoes were powder for sure but flavorful. Cheesecake was good. Staff was nice. Slept really well. Bed was comfy-I’m 57yrs and 5’4” and I fit nicely. The rocking was peaceful.

Woke up in Denver jumped off and ate at snooze. We had an hour. Good meal at Snooze and yummy coffee. That station is gorgeous. DNV-winter park-Granby-Glenwood Springs-Grand Junction was all day on Saturday and it was beautiful and so relaxing. Lunch was a grilled ham and cheese and chips. It was yummy. Observation deck is great!

It’s dark and I was sleeping all through UT. We had a couple of delays. No big deal so we woke up in Elko NV. On to Winnemucca NV, Reno and then Truckee CA-that stretch was amazing this time of year. We saw Donner Lake and all the ski runs. Following the river is breath taking.

After that was sitting listening to an audio book and gazing out the windows. If you are looking for a very relaxing super chill trip-this is it. I know there are other options where you can get off the train and stay in various cities and then get back on a train. That’s my next adventure. I think it’s called US Rail Pass.

I packed really light because no one cares what you’re wearing. Be comfy. There is a shower so bring shower shoes. Bring books and cards if you’re coming with someone else. I traveled solo.  I didn’t need an extension cord as several suggested. It was clean so I didn’t feel the need to wipe things down. Of course if that’s something my you do anyway, go ahead and bring Clorox wipes.

In the dining car you are seated with strangers in order to fill each booth with four people so be ready to chit chat with new people. If you are not in a roomette, meals are extra like lunch is $25. That’s pretty steep for a sandwich and chips. I’m really glad I did a roomette. A couple of ppl i talked to did coach (a chair) and slept in that for the trip (2 nights) with no access to showers.

1r0bez0,https://i.redd.it/2grt51mkdiig1.jpeg,PSA: Boss Fight Studios Blanks,"Hey I picked up these Boss Fight Studio blank figures and they are pretty great. However, if anyone else was hoping to use them for Marvel Legends customs, I wanted to give you a heads up that they are a little too big for your average female character. 

They are taller than the standard female buck and closer in height to the Vulcan buck. Still shorter than him though. 

I think these would work well for female characters who are canonically tall, like Emma, Storm, and Betsy (all 5’10 - 5’11) but not tall enough for characters like She-Hulk, Titania, etc. 

The other thing that should be said is I couldn’t find a single preexisting ML head that could fit on the peg (they are not too big but too long of a peg). Psylocke “fits” but still sits a little high and looks a tad undersized in my opinion. 

Last criticism is that I couldn’t find a single head that was close in skin tone to either figure. The beige champagne figure has a very yellow undertone and makes it hard to match to any of the light skin figures I have. And the coffee brown figure is so much darker than any figure I have. Even the X-Men ‘97 Storm who has a quite dark complexion is lighter than this figure. 

I may mod their size down a bit but shortening the lower leg. Basically cutting it and then gluing it back together but that remains TBD. 

I’ll experiment with them later to see if body part swaps are possible with ML, like arms, legs, feet, hands, and torsos.

**Why This Pick?**

The Hornets are on an absolute tear, friends. Charlotte has won their last 9 straight games, and their win streak includes a few very impressive upsets. At this point, it simply doesn’t make any sense not to give them the benefit of the doubt on their own court. While the Pistons are a worthy opponent, at the very least, I say Charlotte keeps this encounter within a basket. I’m on the Hornets to cover.

My real feelings are that I love who you are and I feel butterflies whenever I think about you. Your presence and energy make me feel calm, safe, seen, secure, beautiful, happy and like I am able to be myself completely. When I am around you my feminine and maternal instincts kick in and I want to care for you. I want to feed you, cook your favorite meals, know and bake your favorite treats. I want to care for the young P's heart you talked about and P, the man's heart, which I know is imperfect but also feels loving and gently caring and understanding. My heart wants to provide that warm and soft place for yours to rest and feel at home and forget your pain and loneliness. I really want to tell you you are great, strong, sexy, courageous, capable and special all the time. You made me feel loved when you got the office coffee ready, sent me songs, and when you hugged me and felt my bones and butt. Likewise, I felt so close to you breathing you in and I really like how holding your hands and hugging you feels so natural and right. I like your bald head, cute nose, and love the way your brown eyes soften and melt me when I look into them. I love your laugh and think you have the cutest smile. I saw your body do that adorable scrunch when you were happy to see me. The way you speak to me softly and slowly, and ask so many questions, really revealed your sweet and sensitive side to me. I believe you will make a wonderful and generous partner, provider, lover, and protector. I know you've felt like I kept you guessing by not saying enough and I truly apologize for doing that to you. I really think we could teach each other so much and balance and heal each other in time and I want to show you that I'm serious.

When I wasn't texting you I was thinking all of these things, all the time, missing you so much. Guess that's just some, but I feel like it's what I haven't said to you all the way.

Couple more things, the day you brought flowers, I was having a fall-apart day and already crying alone in my car. Like 10 feet out the parking lot. And the day you told me you were looking at my Facebook, I had done the same thing and... Probably at the same time. ",7,1770659977.0,yearning,0,1.0,False

**ORIGINAL POST  Feb 6:**

Hi Friends,  
Just touching base to stay in sync with the times I wear loads of m/up everyday in a bazillion styles and colors.  
Never want to be that mature person who looks like they forgot their glasses while doing their face routine.  
\#yayforretinol #agingisapriveledge

**POST UPDATE & COMMENT RESPONSE  Feb 7:**

As requested, here we go, Folks....

* **Make-up**
   * Full face almost every day for as long as I can remember
   * Always begin with hydration and sunscreen
   * I use a plate/tray as a face product palette
   * A bazillion brushes divided into wet/dry for foundation, green BB for rosacea, bronzer, contour, concealer, blush #1, blush#2, highlights, blurring powder, contour, liquid eyeliner, powder eyeliner, various sizes for light & dark eyeshadows, brow base, brow detail, lips, aannnd a final big dense brush for smoothness and excess product removal
   * Makeup products used:
      * Elf : green corrector for rosacea, skin tone fair n foundation, darker n foundation (for shaping/definition/details), very light fair liquid concealer to define nose/upper lip/jaw line/temples, putty to fill t zone scars and pores, liquid cream blush in berry with highlight in it (exact shade rubbed off), eyebrow pencil \* 2 shades, black mascara, very fair tone concealer, light pink tint lip gloss
      * Essence: contour stick with a cool N tone, black mascara, eyeliner (Black, brown, & light nude for lower waterline), lip liner berry, brown mascara to help create half missing right brow
      * Unknown brands from Ipsy: Cream mat bronzer for full face definition/jawline sculpting/double chin masking with big dense brush, dark cool berry lipliner, highlighter for cheeks/nose/edge of top lip, setting powder for brows, blurring powder on for head, t zone pores and scaring, Black liquid eyeliner pen for outer eye wing and brows
      * Tart eyeshadow palette : mid neutrals for eye shaping. dark brown for the eyeliner/eyebrow base shape, shimmer for mid eyelid, \*pallet does not include shade names. Tart fair eyelid primer for inner eye corners and under brow definition.
      * Traditional Middle Eastern black Khol ""crayon"" of unkown brand
      * Dark brown eyebrow pencil from the dollar store to help build texture where there is a bald spot that took out half my eyebrow at the moment.
      * Nina Pool dupe  homemade alcohol setting spray
   * Re-apply moisture lightly with a dry brush under eyes, t-zone, and forehead
   * My lips are lightly tattoo blushed bc my mouth is tiny and was pale. Now I mainly use tinted glosses
   * Bless all the creators on social media with all their tips/tricks/advice
   * My hair started to fall out 2 years in and had to be shaved off in 2018.
   * I lost all my eyelashes and eyebrows only once...thank God....bc no eyelashes is a pain in the butt.
   * If you have lost your eyebrows, head to YouTube, follow your bone structure rather than emulating another shape, stand back a bit from the mirror when you do the base shape and move closer for the details. (Be kind to yourself, they are just eyebrows. :))
   * I watched lot of YouTube wig videos produced by people of colour creators. Life savers.
   * I buy cheap wigs with good reviews from amazon/temu and then style them up.
   * When they get scraggly end that can no longer be tamed, into the garbage they go.
   * Lastly, it was hard losing my full head of Italian curls. In those ""poor me"" moments, I lean hard into gratitude: I am lucky my hair loss is from alopecia and not cancer treatment.
* **Skin**
   * No set routine, just a wide range of random consistencies
      * Mineral sunscreen if leaving the house
      * Tretinoin 2-3 times a week on face, neck, chest, and backs of hands
      * Hyaluronic and Glycolic acids (The Ordinary) 1-2 times a week on face, neck, chest, and backs of hands
      * I have sensory issues so don't do the traditional wash face am and pm. Full washes in shower and otherwise I clean with Micellar water.
      * Korean face clothes in the shower with face cleanser/oils/Head n Shoulders
      * Sludge over night/an hour 3-4 times a month with either diaper cream for rosacea, Vaseline, coconut oil, caster oil, or hydration product
      * LIGHTLY foot file using the FINE SIDE with LOOOOTS OF SOAP 11's's/forehead/neck/chest ONCE a month
      * After showering, I take a ""cold plunge"" rinse
      * Remove makeup with Micellar water at night 80% of the time and forget to take off my make up the other 20%
      * Use castor oil on clean skin around my eyes 2-3 times a week
      * Affordable natural/nontoxic products
   * Collegian supplements: powder for drinking and Snow Fungus to eat
   * Sleep: 9-11hrs on the regular with limited pillows and often just neck support
   * Estrogen patches bc full hysterectomy in 2024
   * Never created a human
   * Random face yoga exercises 5-10 times a week b4 bed, in the car and when I walk past a mirror only to see my mesiolabial folds waving hello
   * Regarding facelifts, fillers, and Botox: If I used them I would be showing off their success. With the price of whole foods these days and 6 pets, they are just not a budget priority.
   * At 175lbs, I am pretty sure the chub helps soften the wrinkles. Lol
* **Diet**
   * **Foods:** 95% whole food diet, wide variety of fruit & veg, nuts & seeds, limited condiment use, fermented foods, moderated portions of quality meat, wide variety of spices/herbs/vinegars and chili oil/sauces , good eggs, butter not margarine, olive oil, ghee for cooking, no lite or diet products apart from sugar free jello, avoid seed/veg oils, tofu firm/med/soft, no fast food, restaurants are Indian/Vietnamese/traditional Chinese/Middle Eastern/Hispanic, whole grain organic bread in the freezer do i don't randomly snack on it, rice/seed crackers, canned products (veg, beans, quail eggs, saag, tuna/sardines), moderate amounts of rice/pasta/bulger/noodles, limited cereals/home made granola/porridge/chia bowls
   * **Drinks:** alcohol 2-5 times a year, juices cut with 30% water on special occasions, no soda/pop, home made cordials infused with things like lemon/lime/moringa/soursop/sorrel/mint/ginger/crushed frozen Costco berries, lots of traditional spiced chai/Middle Eastern black tea/Asian green tea, ridiculous amounts of espresso/coffee with cream and a touch of dark cocoa
   * Eating habits:
      * In 2025 I was in a metabolic psychiatry program which uses ketogenesis to treat inflammation in the body caused by cptsd, autoimmune diseases (alopecia areata & fibromyalgia), and the after affects of cervical cancer/full hysterectomy. Now I just take moderate my complex carb intake.
      * I suck at drinking water so I supplement with lots of soups/stews/salad/fruit/veg
      * OMAD 90% of weekdays with my meal between 3:30-7pm, weekends often include a brunch bc who doesn't love a good brunch!
      * 1-3 snacks between meal and bedtime (Controversial I know but late eating comes with my Cypriot/Italian'ess)
      * Olive oil, olive oil, annnnnnd more olive oil
      * Keep all veg scraps and bones to batch cook nutrient packed broths for the freezer
      * I cook from scratch = healthier, cheaper, fun, fast

**CONCLUSION:**  
I am proof that make-up is MAGICAL. Without it I'm a wee chubby troll, with almost no brows and eyelashes, little face definition, rosacea covered cheeks/nose, drooped textured eyelids, eyebags, saggy mesiolabial folds and chicken fluff for hair.

PS. Sorry about all the typo's. I cant type for sh\*t, hate editing,  guilty of gamer lingo, and still don't know how I spent an afternoon composing this ginormous essay.

PPS. If you don't have anything nice to say, keep it to yourself. Going out of your way to drag others down says more about you then it does them. Rise up and choose Kindness.

**What it is:** WealthVision - a collection of interactive financial calculators that show how daily habits and investment decisions compound over time.

**The hook:** People can see in real-time how their €5 daily coffee habit could become €149k in 10 years if invested instead (at 7% returns). Or how much house they can afford based on their actual cashflow.

**Why I built it:**

* Most financial calculators are boring, hidden behind paywalls, or require signup
* People don't connect daily spending to long-term wealth loss
* Wanted something visual and immediate that makes the ""aha"" moment happen

**Key features:**

* 100% free, no signup required
* Real market data (actual ETF performance, etc.)
* Privacy-first (no tracking)
* Multiple calculators for different life stages

**My question:** For those of you who've built similar tools or work in fintech - what's been your experience getting traction? I'm currently exploring affiliate partnerships to monetize without charging users.

I’m one of the founders of [Kosuke.ai](http://Kosuke.ai) a SaaS we’re building as a full‑time, bootstrapped, no investors team of 8 living and working together in a small (very very small but full of coffee) house in Milan since November 2025. We started as a CTO‑as‑a‑Service for early‑stage teams, but after a few months it became obvious that the most used and loved part of the product was the collaboration layer on top of existing codebases.

So we doubled down and built what is basically “Lovable for existing products”: a way to enable everyone to contribute to an existing repo without trashing quality. You import your codebase, describe changes in plain English, and our AI writes code that follows your existing conventions, patterns and architecture, so engineers review clean PRs instead of rewriting everything.

The philosophy is simple: everyone contributes, engineers stay in control. PMs, founders and non‑core devs can propose and iterate on changes, while the core team keeps full ownership through normal review workflows, tests and CI. No giant rewrites, no AI black box repo, just more momentum on the code you already have.

We are currently at around 13K MRR --> We have completely moved away from the initial product which was very consultative even though we could have been at least +10K MRR

*CW: Graphic violence, mental illness, medication non-compliance, psychotic episode, injury, blood, legal consequences*

Evelyn woke that morning to the sound of coffee being ground. The whir of the grinder was like thunder and wind in to sleep-addled brain, and it took a long moment for her to register that she lived alone. Who the fuck was in her house?

She slipped her robe and slippers on and grabbed the knife she kept in the drawer. She crept out of her bedroom and down the stairs. A man was humming in her kitchen. She heard the toilet in the powder room by the front door flush. A woman exited. Couldn’t make out the face, just red hair, and very naked.

“Making coffee, babe?”

“Yeah, honey. That Costa Rican we bought yesterday.”

She heard a squeal, the sound of a hand lightly tapping skin, and moans.

Who the fuck was in her house?

She lowered herself and almost crawled down the stairs. She peeked around the corner into the kitchen and saw the pair in the midst of lovemaking on her marble countertop. On the new towels she’d just bought yesterday! The nice daffodil-colored ones. She growled in her throat. Too much.

Evelyn leapt into the kitchen with the knife, yowling. The man and woman barely registered her before the knife plunged into the man’s shoulder, blood spurting. He screamed. She screamed. Evelyn cackled.

“Who the fuck are you?” the man yelled hoarsely.

“My house,” she declared, pulling the knife out. He fell backwards on the floor, hitting his head against the kitchen counter. She couldn’t tell if he was out or just dazed, but it didn’t matter. Neutralized.

“Evelyn.”

The name stopped her cold. She looked at the woman with the red hair, finally seeing her. Those brown eyes. The freckles. The scar above the eye.

“Jessica?”

“Yeah, honey. It’s me. Put the knife down. Come on, baby.” Jessica was approaching her like she was a wild animal. Evelyn handed her the weapon. “Did you forget to take your meds yesterday?”

Meds. Right. Fuck. Evelyn nodded. Jessica sighed. She took the phone off the hook, an old landline type, and dialed 9-1-1. Explained to the operator that there had been a stabbing, that yes, they needed emergency services and the police. Evelyn sobbed.

“What did I do?”

“You stabbed Bryan. I told you I was bringing him home last night, remember?”

Evelyn didn’t, at least not yet. Things were coming back to her. Their agreement last year that they’d have an open relationship; just needed to alert the other person. She didn’t like that, she remembered. But Jessica had begged, and Evelyn caved. Anything for her wife, anything to keep her around through all this.

Coffee wafted in the air as Evelyn sank to the granite flooring. Bryan was moaning, blood pooling on the ground beneath him. She crawled over to him, grabbed the new towels, and tried to staunch the blood from the knife wound. She couldn’t get him turned over enough. His eyes were glazed over, and his breathing came shallow.

She looked up at Jessica, now dressed, tears running down her freckled cheeks. “I’m so sorry.”

“I know, love. I can’t… I can’t do this anymore. You need help, proper help. Treatment that you aren’t getting.”

Sirens sounded outside.

“They’re going to arrest me.”

“They are.”

“I love you.”

“I love you, too.”

“I want help.”

Jessica had apparently kept the door unlocked as paramedics rushed in. There weren’t a lot of questions, just stabilizing Bryan and getting him into the ambulance. Police came. Arrested her. Evelyn told them she needed help, that she thought they were strangers. Jessica backed her up. They explained she would be placed in jail pending a pre-trial hearing. She’d need representation.

The coffee had gone cold an hour ago, but neither of them had noticed. Evelyn went willingly.

“That’ll help you,” Officer Snitker told her.

“Don’t say anything without your lawyer,” Officer McCreary advised.

She nodded. Kept herself quiet. Let them lead her. Court was a blur, something about needing hearings to determine if she could assist in her own defense. It was decided she couldn’t. That was fine. Into a hospital. Cold. Paper sheets. Paper gown. Regulations. Weeks, she thought.

Jessica came daily. Ate lunch with her. Held her hand. They cried together. She apologized. Broken things off with the couple of men and women she’d been dating, focused solely on Evelyn. Told her that her readers were rallying support, pouring money into a fundraiser she hadn’t set up.

She was released into Jessica’s care on a Saturday, with strict instructions about therapy and medications, and a new court date. Bryan was pressing charges. Their lawyer suspected a lawsuit after the jury found her not guilty. It had probably helped that she couldn’t even answer questions, just kept apologizing over and over on the stand. He sued them. They settled. Money didn’t matter. She’d hurt him. Let him take the fucking kingdom for all she cared.

One morning, Evelyn woke to the sounds of the coffee grinder. She could feel the coolness in the air, that lighter atmosphere that suggests snow had fallen in the night. She pushed open the heavy curtains that blocked out the light. Snow hadn’t just fallen; it was falling. Inches covered the ground.

“A heaven of diamonds shines down through the night…” she sang. One of her favorites.

She slipped on her robe and slippers and crept down the stairs. Jessica was humming. Evelyn smiled. She slinked into the kitchen, saw her wife setting the coffee to brew, red hair pulled up above a brown robe.

“Good morning, love,” Evelyn said, placing a kiss to her shoulder.

“Morning, babe. Any dreams?”

“Just you and me, right here, drinking coffee.”

“What kind are you making?”

“A Sumatran dark blend.”

When the coffee was finished, they sat like teenagers on the marble countertop, hot cups in their hands. Jessica had given Evelyn her meds, watched until they were swallowed, then kissed her for completing the task. They sat like that, quiet, sipping their coffee. Evelyn cried. It felt good to be whole again.",1,1770659766.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

It’s a 701 (pro) and I’m using beans that were roasted 2 weeks ago (CoffeeWorks Classic Italian Espresso), I’ve used up 3/4 of the 250g bag over the past 45m as I try to dial it in, as Barista Assist seems to be all over the place.

First things first: my initial shot was done on strength 2, when I noticed this, I made sure to change to strength 3.

Since then anyway, barista assist won’t seem to settle to a specific grind size. It has gone from 17, to 20, to 17, to 20 and refuses to split the difference between these or to just pick either 17 or 20.

I took things into my own hands and decided 18 and 19, to when it finally chose a different size to try or 21, but I’ve used up a lot of my beans, it’s now 6pm & the machine has even told me to refill the water tank - it’s been 45m!!

With the option of just ignoring barista assist, what should I look out for in order for to know the shot is dialled in? I’m a beginner to this so not exactly sure what to look for here. I don’t know what is too quick or too slow of a shot speed, and I don’t know what volume is good or bad.

I’ve heard that I should time the shots as soon as the drips hit the glass and then add 7 seconds, and if that total is between 25-30 seconds then that should be a decent extraction.

1r0b4a1,https://i.redd.it/6rmohfarthig1.jpeg,The GF Drama of Atlanta's Hell Yeah Gluten Free,"This is a long one, but it's got some gluten free drama for y'all. If you live in the Southeast or have visited Atlanta, you are probably familiar with Hell Yeah Gluten Free. Hell Yeah started as an at-home business by Alejandra Luaces, who started doing pop-ups (Yeasted Fried Donuts!!!) and made-to-order bakes like cakes and things in 2018, at a time when there really weren't any options for gluten free baked goods in the Atlanta area. Alejandra was able to open up a physical bakery in Atlanta in 2019, and Hell Yeah quickly became famous for her delicious baked goods, including fantastic puff pastry used to make items like pop tarts and pastelitos. Most famous were her giant biscuit breakfast sandwiches, which were so good that many people who weren't even gluten free would visit her bakery for her fluffy biscuits and rich, creamy baked eggs.

A huge part of the success of Hell Yeah was also the culture Alejandra cultivated. She was very transparent on social media, being open about her pricing, her approach to customer service, and her commitment to providing benefits for her staff. The staff at Hell Yeah were always warm, friendly and helpful, and you could often catch Alejandra behind the counter and have a nice talk about her latest bakery inventions. She also highlighted other artists and gluten free creators in the community, featuring other gluten free bakers in pop-ups within her space to sell their breads, bagels, dumplings, etc.

Around 2023, the success of Hell Yeah presented Alejandra with some opportunities to expand. From what I can pick up from news coverage, she picked up some new investors and opened a second location in the Atlanta neighborhood of Decatur, with plans to open a larger private kitchen in town where gluten free baked goods could be made to ship nationwide. It was around this time that Alejandra became less present in the stores, presumably working on her widespread expansion, though she was still very present on social media, posting updates about the stores, new projects and responding to messages.

After about a year of business, the Decatur location started getting less reliable. Strange hours, some days just not opening at all, or some days opening with little to no product. Alejandra was still nowhere to be seen, and if you asked the staff how she was doing, they'd often say ""Oh she's good, she's at the other store today."" In both stores, the variety and inventiveness of the product was starting to fall off. While Alejandra would previously change the whole menu every season, posting about her creative process trying new flavors, the menu was becoming fairly stagnant, possibly also a symptom of expansion and getting busy. 

Despite some drop-offs in quality and customer service, the bakery was experiencing more success than ever. It was, and still is, the #1 restaurant in Atlanta on FindMeGlutenFree, and it was making national write-ups for gluten free bakeries in America. 

A couple of months ago, news started to flood social media for the Atlanta gluten free community. Several former pop-up partners of the bakery and some former employees all posting their own thoughts with a similar message: though many of them had been made to sign an NDA, they didn't feel right staying silent anymore. Alejandra had been forced out by her financiers during the expansion period, and these new owners were **pretending to be Alejandra on social media (creepy), having staff tell people that she was ""at the other location"" whenever asked, and still calling themselves an ""independent, female, latina owned business"" in the press when they weren't any longer.** This was obviously met with some local outrage, with people commenting on their Instagram posts that they needed to come clean about what happened. Anyone who commented anything of the like was blocked, their comments were deleted, and Hell Yeah took about a month off from posting before returning as if nothing happened. 

With everyone who was trying to get to the truth now blocked from their social media, it seemed like the new owners were going to keep pretending nothing had changed. The new owners have continued to stay totally quiet online, with absolutely nothing published to show the change. If you were to google who owns Hell Yeah, you would still get the result of Alejandra Luaces. Quality and customer service continued to decline, especially at the second location, until a few months ago when the store just didn't open for a week. After days of silence about what was going on there, they posted to their story that they would be hosting a pop-up at the Decatur Location. You can find a picture of the post below. In the post, they said that the pop-up who would be using the dedicated kitchen at Hell Yeah did bake with gluten, but that they would be ""upbundantly"" cautious by using different utensils and equipment. It's important to note that the entire appeal of Hell Yeah is that it is and always has been dedicated gluten free. People post on FindMeGlutenFree that they drive hours from across the South East because they feel safe at HellYeah. This was obviously met with major backlash, with some major gluten free influencers posting their concern online that a dedicated bakery would allow someone to just ""pop up"" with some gluten for the day.

Many people concerned about the gluten free community in Atlanta who would normally comment on Instagram to complain about this pop-up were already blocked, so they took to FindMeGlutenFree, making sure to mark that the Decatur location was no longer a dedicated space and expressing their disdain for the current ownership on the pages for the Decatur and the flagship location. In a few hours, the Decatur page on FindMeGlutenFree had lost their Dedicated GF badge, and the flagship store had dropped several stars from their coveted 5 Star, Best of Atlanta spot.

A few days later, however, all the negative reviews were gone from their flagship page. Since most of the negative reviews on the flagship store mentioned what was happening at the Decatur location, they were moved over to the Decatur store page. And then, with a consensus 1 star rating and no dedicated gluten free status, the owners announced the Decatur location was closing permanently. The FindMeGlutenFree page was taken down, and just like on Instagram, all the reviews exposing the owners for their shady business were deleted again.

If a gf traveler were to visit Atlanta today, a quick Google search would tell them that Hell Yeah Gluten Free is the #1 gluten free destination in town and that Alejandra is still the owner. It's pretty incredible how easily these new owners are able to bob and weave around the local sentiment and keep any of it from making its way online. The word is out locally for sure, at a local gluten free market hosted by Monday Night Brewing (which has a fantastic dedicated gluten free pizza kitchen now), Hell Yeah's booth had no customers the entire time I was there. I just wish we were able to spread the word wider. It sucks that Alejandra not just built Hell Yeah from the ground up, but fostered the gluten free community in Atlanta, and now these guys can kick her out and overshadow all the businesses in town that actually care. If you're visiting Atlanta, skip Hell Yeah and check out dedicated restaurants like Mediterranea, Chicheria or Arepa Mia. Or the incredible dedicated gluten free Valley's Bakery in Marietta (with fried yeast donuts!) Or Love It Gluten Free with baos and buns at various farmers markets on the weekend. Or the wonderful Slay the Gluten for cakes! Just don't patronize some faceless businessmen who keep lying so they can profit off the gluten free community. And if you feel so inclined, I've found that reviews on FindMeGlutenFree that don't mention the Decatur location are left up...

We started as a CTO‑as‑a‑Service for early‑stage teams, but after a few months it became obvious that the most used and loved part of the product was the collaboration layer on top of existing codebases.

So we doubled down and built what is basically “Lovable for existing products”: a way to enable everyone to contribute to an existing repo without trashing quality. You import your codebase, describe changes in plain English, and our AI writes code that follows your existing conventions, patterns and architecture, so engineers review clean PRs instead of rewriting everything.

The philosophy is simple: everyone contributes, engineers stay in control. PMs, founders and non‑core devs can propose and iterate on changes, while the core team keeps full ownership through normal review workflows, tests and CI. No giant rewrites, no AI black box repo, just more momentum on the code you already have.

We are currently at around 13K MRR --> We have completely moved away from the initial product which was very consultative even though we could have been at least +10K MRR

1r0b2up,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0b2up,REDUX: Two friends looking to make connections in York's LGBT+ Community,"Hi there! 

This is a follow up to a post that I made in this subreddit back in January. For anyone who missed it, here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/york/comments/1qdd8z1/two_friends_looking_to_make_connections_in_yorks/

As a refresher, here's the summary: 

""My friend and I are both gay men living in York. We’ve been trying to branch out and make new connections in the city, but the few existing local groups didn't quite fit what we were looking for.

We’re just wondering if there are other LGBT+ folks, especially people in their 20s/30s, who are a bit nerdy, alternative, and/or introverted and who also haven't found their spot yet who maybe wanted to meet up with us to make some new friendly connections!

We were thinking just a chilled coffee meetup with no pressure or formal club rules. If we all get along, maybe we do it again?

About us: mid-30s sci-fi nerd (Star Trek, Murderbot, Adrian Tchaikovsky) + late-20s cinephile/music lover/gamer (psychological horror, Disco Elysium, Radiohead, Nick Drake, Kate Bush, Talking Heads).""

After making the above post, my friend and I met up at Cityscreen on the Friday we mentioned, and it went really well - a couple of people came along to meet us, which was lovely. :-)

We did get a fair number of comments and messages from people who said they'd be interested but who couldn't make the date and time we'd set though, so with that in mind, we thought we'd arrange another similar meet-up - this time with slightly more advance warning! 

Here's the tentative plan: 

Where: Cityscreen Cafe

When: 19:00 Thursday 12th of February (i.e. this Thursday) 

You'll know it's us because we'll have a fluffy rabbit toy on our table like the one in the attached photo. That's the sign! 

We'll try to snag the sofa at the back of Cityscreen cafe, but depending on how many people turn up, we might have to take our posse elsewhere – upstairs at The Habit and The Exhibition Hotel struck me as two possible places we could try on the night. 

If this sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee!), please drop a comment below so we can get an idea of numbers. If you're interested but feeling shy, feel free to shoot me a DM instead. I'll also send out messages individually to the specific people who responded to the last post!

This time, we've also created an event in the York Discord server meet-ups channel, so if anyone here is a member of the York Discord and wants to confirm their interest/attendance that way, they're welcome to do so. The name of the event is: “12/02/2026 - Informal LGBT+ Meet-up @ Cityscreen Cafe”

All the best, and maybe see you there! :-)",11,1770659399.0,york,3,0.79,False

**THE MYSTERY OF PRAYER**

Never be afraid to pray boldly to God  
For no matter the crisis our Lord is aware.  
Sometimes it's hard to recognize God's answers  
But that's just part of the mystery of prayer.

**GOODNESS, BRAVERY, & ATTITUDE**

Stand proud and preach for the Grace of God  
If you wish to relay your gratitude.  
Set an example for those who follow  
By your goodness, bravery and attitude.

**SEEDS OF SPLENDOR**

Let God take the weight of our burdens  
We were never meant to endure alone.  
He will never bend us, break us or destroy us  
As the seeds of His splendor are sown.

**LOVE**

I love to be loved in the morning  
I love to be loved at night.  
I love to be loved anytime  
For love in the darkness is light.

**FAITH**

Our confidence and trust in a higher power  
Helps guide us through every moment and hour.  
Fidelity to one’s promise and observance of law  
Lets our Lord know we heed his call.

 

 

**LIBERTY**

May God continue to bless America  
Refusing evil, the upper hand.  
It’s up to us to stay resolute  
Defending the liberty of Man.

**INTEGRITY**

What Satan has planned for our harm  
Integrity will transform to good.  
Adhering to morals gives us peace  
Teaching us to respond, as we should.

**AMERICAN SOLDIER**

They risk their life and limb for liberty  
Standing firm against evil unwilling to break.  
To be part of something greater then themselves  
They are willing to sacrifice whatever it will take.

**SEPTEMBER 11\*\*\*\*****^(TH.)**

We shall seek them out wherever they may hide  
Street by street, house-by-house, cave by cave.  
They will be eradicated from the face of the earth  
By the righteous, the loyal and the brave.

**CONSCIENCE**

Our conscience makes us righteous  
It's a whisper of God in man.  
For without it we're mere puppets  
Who dance to the devil's hand.

 

**TROUBLES**

Mankind is born from a woman’s womb  
With a short life that's full of trouble.  
Faith is our refuge in times of woe  
For without it our troubles double.

**FREEDOM**

Should tomorrow start without me  
Be proud I choose to serve  
Our faith and our patriotism  
Earn the freedom we deserve.

**HAPPY HEARTS**

Happy hearts prosper on what is truthful and good  
Where dishonored ones fester and rot to the bone.  
Life charts our course but God guides our way  
As His wisdom and love become our own.

**THE KING OF CHRISTMAS**

Hallelujah Jesus the king of Christmas night  
With a star for his crown bathed in holy light  
Christ is our savior who leads by trust and love  
Delivering us from Satan to the grace of God Above.

**FOOTSTEPS**

All of Gods heroes depend on courage  
To overcome the dilemmas of strife.  
God wants us to follow in His footsteps  
As we practice His majesty of life.

**JEHOVAH**

Christians trust you can run but not hide  
From the eyes of Jehovah who is always aware  
Loving us regardless of weakness toward sin  
And when we cry out, “He’s there.”

**MY FAVORITE POET**

My favorite poet is our Father of love  
Who was first to know us before birth.  
His poetry prolongs everything we love  
As His deliverance gives life its worth.

**JESUS IS A FISHERMAN**

Jesus is a fisherman  
Who saves the souls of man.  
Dead or alive He leads the faithful  
To the streams of promise land.

**TRUST**

Goodness and evil illustrate life  
Like the two sides of every coin.  
Most can’t help but experience both  
As we learn who to trust, follow and join.

**JESUS**

The beam was up-ended by the muscles of men  
As it plunged down the hole it was carved to fit in.  
Then Jesus looked up at the lightning that flew  
And cried, ""God, My Father, they know not what they do.""

**NIGHT OF NIGHTS**

So let's rejoice, and sing with great cheer  
That night when Jesus slept without fear.  
For our Lord's birthday comes once a year  
On that night of nights we hold so dear.

**GRACE**

From dust we were made and shall return  
After life has brought us to our earthly end.  
Though all must walk in the shadow of death  
The righteous are promised they will rise again.

**WISDOM**

The words of the wise are heard in quiet  
More than the loud shouts of screaming fools.  
Wisdom and knowledge cause stability  
In the lives of those who use them as tools.

**THE ARMOR OF GOD**

Eagerly plotting to disrupt God's works  
Evil swallows up souls like the shifting sand.  
The armor of God is our divine protection  
Shielding every child, woman, and man.

**SOLDIERS**

Where are the soldiers so far, far away?  
How many will perish no one can say.  
Where are the soldiers we love night and day?  
Deployed world over to keep evil at bay.

**THEY SERVE TO PRESERVE**

They serve to preserve our forefathers dreams,  
Prayers, visions and determination.  
Risking all in pursuit of fulfillment of duty  
To God, freedom, faith, honor and nation.

**SOMETHING WICKED**

When something wicked stares us in the face  
To corrupt our morals, faith and resolve.  
God gives us courage to defend what’s right  
No matter the sacrifice or danger involved.

**EVIL**

Evil seeks to destroy the good in man  
And silence the memory of God’s law.  
It’s up to the faithful to stay unyielding  
Defending the liberty and justice of all.

**HARM’S WAY**

Our men and woman who serve in harm’s way  
Are the armor of what the free world depends on.  
Without their sacrifice of body and soul  
All that we stand for is gone.

**TERRORISM**

We’ll defeat terrorism as it should be fought  
Never letting Satan’s horde chase us to our door.  
Safeguarding our borders and system of life  
As our forefathers sacrificed before.

**AMERICA**

Never be afraid to be proud of America  
And march with the brave, faithful and just.  
Refusing to submit to the will of our enemies  
Standing firm to preserve what we trust.

**SUPPORT OUR TROOPS**

Support our troops who battle the horde  
While we live the good life back home.  
When you see a soldier show them your smile  
Say “hello we love you and you’re not alone.”

**WAR**

As war is fought it takes charge  
And events spin out of control.  
The madness of men can alter the soil  
Which nourishes the roots of their soul.

**HEAVEN’S MEASURE**

What we accomplish is heaven’s measure  
As patriots respond to the threats of man.  
Protect and defend what we love till death  
As the soldiers of Satan arise from the sand.

**WE WHO REMAIN**

America has survived all attempts to destroy  
Knowing the cruelty of war  
And, we who remain  
Must help keep her free  
For those who can march no more!

**VETERAN'S DAY**

The cost of freedom is sometimes high  
Extremely more when our loved one's die.  
Men and women pledged to fight and serve  
And it's our support that they deserve.

**FORMIDABLE FOE**

America is the birthday cake of earth  
As the ants march from every direction.  
Thank God for all who have sworn to defend her  
Serving with love, honor, pride, and affection.

**EVERY CHILD OF GOD**

 

Every child of God arrived to do good

Every child of God must serve what they should.

Every child of God shall always feel love

Every child of God and Heaven above!

 

**MOMS**

 

Moms are certainly God’s gift to Earth

So if you still have one, let it be known.

You can’t imagine your life without her

While the seeds of your future are sown.

 

**HEAVEN’S HEROES**

All Heaven's heroes except for Jesus and Daniel

Had to be forgiven for their willingness to stray.

They let God down and paid the price

And their stories still relate today.

 

**GREED**

 

Wealth, fame, power, and libido

Are the trophies of what greed consists of.

A hunger to experience every exotic wish  
Overpowering the glory of love.

 

**CHRISTMAS & LOVE**

 

Christmas helps us remember  
What the joys of life are for.  
It makes us want to love someone  
Till angels arrive and more.

 

**HATRED!**

 

If hatred consumes you refuse it control  
For only then can you begin to live.

We don't have to remain wicked and spiteful  
We just have to be willing to forgive.

 

**HARDSHIPS**

 

# The Lord knows and sees our hardships

Dilemmas we are unable to control.

He personally invites us to turn to Him

As the outcomes of life take their toll.

 

**ANGER**

An angry soul opens its mouth  
And shuts its mind to reason.  
All who stay slow to anger  
Are loved by more each season.

 

# OLD AGE??

Oh, bear with me for I am old  
And lucky to be alive.

My years have passed much too fast  
Though somehow, I survive.

 

If I repent, my parson said  
My sins shall be forgiven  
Not to wait until too late  
And miss my bus to Heaven.

 

**THANKSGIVING**

 

The theme of Thanksgiving has always been the same.

Though its date has changed many times.

A day for giving and remembering the less fortunate

Expressing thankfulness with our prayers, hearts and minds.

 

**REPENTANCE, GRACE & WISDOM**

 

Thank God for each and every individual

That prays for wisdom, repentance and grace.

Not perfect though remorseful, repentant when wrong

As their devotion radiates from their face.

 

**SATISFACTION**

 

No one finds satisfaction from serving themselves  
Contentment takes place, by unselfish concern.

The more we repent and regret our wrongs  
The more we are able to retain what we learn.

 

**COFFEE $$**

 

Thank God for caffeine found in coffee

Which helps multitudes make it through the day.

Like ancestors of the past, it helps energy to last

And for its stimulant we are eager to pay.

 

**HAPPY HEARTS**

 

Happy hearts prosper on what is truthful and good

Where dishonored one’s fester and rot to the bone.

Life charts our course but God guides our way

As His wisdom and love become our own.

 

**SUCCESS**

 

Let voices proclaim after we have gone

Our love for others still lives on.

Real success comes by who we actually are

Not by trinkets, a big house or car.

 

 

**THE POWER OF WORDS**

 

When we fail to control the rage of our thoughts

What is easy to say becomes hard to forgive.

Words are visions that portray our intent

The better we communicate, the better we live.

 

 

**ULTIMATE SACRIFICE**

 

Those rows of white crosses in manicured fields

Tell the story of ultimate sacrifice and love.

Always remember all we treasure and enjoy

Are because of our soldiers and God above.

 

**HONOR**

 

Honor, morality, faith and integrity

Are what life’s heroes are made of.

Defending what’s right; confronting what’s wrong

Propelled by achievement, courage, and love.

 

**LOVING OTHERS**

Loving others as we wish to be loved ourselves

Is what gives us our best blessings of life.

Think of all those who you need night and day

Praying for husband, parent, friend, coworker or wife.

 

 

**TIME**

 

Do not squander the passing time  
For that's what life is made of

Never put off till tomorrow  
Your time with those you love.

 

**POETRY & PASSION**

 

The magic of poetry is said to be its passion

So often used to teach people how to endure.

It helps us choose what to love and desire

As we experience all that is fearful and unsure.

 

**GOD’S TEST OF HEARTS**

 

The shameless hunger for power, wealth and revenge

Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent to their door.

People who justify immoral behavior

Shall be measured by their misdeeds before.

 

**CONFLICT**

 

The harder the conflict we sometimes face  
The far more glorious is the victory.  
Tyranny like hell is tough to defeat

When it raises its head throughout history.

 

**BEING LOVED BY YOU %**

 

There’s the past, present, future, and beyond

Which will test our measure by what we say and do.

Too many overlook the thrill of now

But not I, for I love being loved by you.

 

**THE POWER OF MONEY $$**

 

**Money is one of life's most powerful forces**

**To fulfill and sustain our Earthly need.**

**We work for it, spend it and waste it away**

**And sometimes we're the victim of greed.**

 

**FULFILL YOUR CALL**

 

God desires each of us to move forward

To provide example of our faith before all.

If you’re currently being called by Heaven above

Rise up, step forth and fulfill your call.

 

**WHAT KIND OF MAN?**

 

What kind of a man do you wish to be

As the footsteps of life race by?

Never hold back kind acts of love

And compassion before you die.

 

**TO BE WITH YOU**

 

Like a blind man riding a fast horse

My love for you is out of control.

I thank Heaven for each and every moment

Your love fascinates and captivates my soul.

 

**BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING**

 

Besides love men need fishing

And for both, most are wishing

Catching trophies chosen best

To be envied by the rest.

 

Most men feel they've everything

With their rod, hook, cork and string.

Be it river, pond or lake

We all pray our line won't break.

 

**FEAR**

 

The secret to overcoming fear

Is to focus on prayer not trouble.

When we go it alone, it’s always the same

All that we fear seems to multiply and double.

 

**WHEN WE DO WRONG**

 

Every time we do wrong is a reason to pray

For staying ungodly, self-centered and cruel.

As we trust God’s wisdom and heed His call

We avoid becoming lost, disloyal and a fool.

 

**WHERE GOD IS?**

 

Where Heaven is, God is

Where God is, Jesus is.

Where faith is, hope is

Where love is, trust is.

Where mercy is, joy is

Where truth is, honor is.

Where sin is, shame is

Where goodness is, God is!

 

 **THE MAGIC OF SLEEP**

 

The magic of sleep sustains the heartbeats of life

Our ability to reason, overcome and succeed.

Without its presence, we wither on the vine

Victims of exhaustion, worry and greed.

 

**WINE**

 

Wine was served at the last supper

And guzzled in King Arthur’s court.

Wine can make a sad man happy

And a mean woman turn good sport.

 

**THE POWER OF POT?**

 

My mom had arthritis could not walk around

I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack

After I smoked some to me it came back.

 

 **TEARS OF JOY**

Not all tears are caused by suffering and pain

Some are caused by blessings from above.

Tears of joy let others witness firsthand

How we flourish from God’s purpose and love.

 

**HAPPINESS**

 

True happiness is a wonderful gift

A joy of life, from God to man.

Though most fear it can’t last

We pray to have it, as long as we can.

 

**SMILE**

 

The one thing that goes the furthest  
Towards making our lives more worthwhile  
Which costs the least but does the most

Is the sight of a friendly smile.

 

**ACCOUNTABILITY**

 

All are accountable to the judgment of God

And when we die without faith our sadness never ends.

By the deepest longing of our heart and soul

We serve our Lord, ourselves, family and friends.

 

**PASSION AND LOVE**

 

Thank Heaven for passion and love

Blessings from God to man.

Without them we’re mere creatures

Subsisting like ants in the sand.

 

 **VETERANS DAY**

 

It’s not a priest who gives us freedom of religion,

It’s not a reporter who give us freedom of voice.

It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacher

But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.

 

**COMMITMENT**

 

What we sacrifice for the needs of others means more

Then anything we might do for ourselves alone.

The more we give the more we shall receive

As the deeds of our commitment are sown.

 

**MARRIAGE**

 

Serving your partner more than yourself

Is not always simple or easy to do.

But when you love someone, you can’t replace

You reconsider your displeasure and renew.

 

**COURAGE**

 

Everyone experiences difficulty, pain, and sadness

During such trying times we rely on God’s will.

His amazing gifts are our blessings of trust and love

The foundations of life that provide, protect, and fulfill.

 

**POETRY & THE ARTS**

 

The eldest sister of all arts  
Which some have called the Devils wine.

Poetry is but pure passion  
To stimulate the heart and mind.

 

**MOMENTARY COURAGE**

 

Momentary courage helps preserve mankind

When our angel within is allowed to rise.

Men, women, children, kings and presidents

Are blessed by deeds not falsehoods and lies.

 

**HEAVEN’S BEST**

My wife to me is heaven’s best gift of all

Her goodness triumphs both inside and out.

She dedicates her life to our friendship and marriage

As our need for one another is what life is about!

 

**MUFFLED DRUMS**

 

Praise the brave that lay without sound  
Whose bodies sleep in timeless ground.

Forget them not, whose motives were true  
Those names on crosses heavy with dew.

 

**AMERICA’S BEST!**

 

How great the brave who rest in peace  
All blessings from heaven to Earth.

They gave our country but their best  
Those destined to be brave from birth.

 

**JUSTICE TEACHES US ??**

 

Justice teaches us to follow God's will

Justice teaches us to defend and fulfill.

Justice teaches us the path not to take

Justice teaches us the price of mistake.

 

**GOD’S BEST!!**

 By worthiness we must partake

For our days to be complete.

Our goodness of deeds magnifies life

No matter time’s tests of defeat.

 Some question why study history

Does our future depend on the past?  
When we forget history, we repeat its mistakes

As the outcomes of all are cast.

1r0b0uq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0b0uq,Will This Machine Give Me True Espresso (Better Than Moka Pot)? What Else Do I Need? More in description,"Hi everyone,

I currently brew my coffee using a moka pot and I enjoy strong black coffee. I also really like the espresso served in cafés and 5-star hotels.

I have a few questions:

	1.	Will this machine produce true espresso comparable to what I get in cafés, or will it be similar to (or only slightly better than) a moka pot?

	2.	How big of a difference is there between moka pot coffee and real espresso from a proper machine?

	3.	What additional equipment would I need to get good results (for example, a quality grinder, tamper, scale, etc.)?

	4.	Is it possible to make excellent espresso with mid-range machines, or do only high-end machines consistently deliver great results?

	5.	For someone who mainly drinks strong black coffee (no milk), what should I prioritize when choosing a machine?

I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve upgraded from a moka pot to an espresso machine.

First week was hell: fatigue, broken sleep, strong morning cravings, feeling like a junkie in withdrawal.  
But right now at day 10:

* Digestion is magic – almost no gas/bloating, no need for remedies anymore
* Skin feels smoother and more hydrated
* Energy is steady all day, even after 1h heavy gym + 2h moderate bike ride
* I go to the gym without any mental push – motivation just comes naturally
* Dropped \~2 kg without changing food or training (mostly water & bloating release)
* Morning wired/tension feeling is almost gone
* Overall much more relaxed, no constant background stress I never realized how much the coffee was holding me hostage. It’s weird to actually *feel* when I’m tired and when I need rest… but I’m already noticing real changes.

however my nights still distributed,sleep has been the hardest part. Before quitting, I averaged 7h3 but it always felt of ,fragmented, tense, and I needed melatonin . Now, 10 days in, nights are still short (5h30–6h30) with multiple wake-ups (often long ones around 2–3am), but the quality is shifting, I fall asleep fast when I go to bed early, and I wake up feeling genuinely rested even on bad nights.

10 Coffea Arabica Seeds (Arabian Coffea Seeds)

10 Sarracenia ssp. Seeds Mix

0.5 gram Ficus Elastica Seeds ( Rubber Fig Seeds)

They send them on the 19 January, I received them ok the 29th of January. So far so good.

I proceeded to plant them all on the 30th of January except for the sarracenia because I put those in the fridge in a wet paper towel for cold stratification.

The nepenthes seeds I planted in sterile sphagnum moss.

The ficus and coffee seeds I put in a well draining soil mix.

All of it is in a temperature controlled Greenhouse.

We started as a CTO‑as‑a‑Service for early‑stage teams, but after a few months it became obvious that the most used and loved part of the product was the collaboration layer on top of existing codebases.

I am slowly reopening a design & build business I’ve been building for the past 6 years.

From 2020 to 2023, by God’s grace, we were able to generate ₱100M+ in accumulated revenue. In 2024, I had to pause operations due to a personal loss that needed my full presence. It wasn’t about the market or the business, it was about life.

Now, I’m ready to stand up again.

The demand is still here. Same niche, wide market, and there’s already around ₱10M worth of projects waiting once we restart. Our systems and processes are intact, and with the right partner, we can strengthen and scale them further.

I’m not chasing quick money, so pass po muna sa sobrang tataas na interest, lenders, and easy money mindset na investors. 

I’m opening this to a genuine angel investor or co-owner who values rebuilding, long-term growth, and doing business the right way.

I am open to a sit-down meeting, either a casual coffee or a meeting at the physical office I’ve already established. I’d recommend we talk face-to-face, walk you through the story, the numbers, and the vision.

I need to sit with this for a bit so I make sure I handle the next steps in the best, most respectful way as possible.

I’m engaged now but, deep down in my heart, know this isn’t who and what I really want.

I had someone I was with for a handful of years. I broke up with them and continued being close friends for a handful more. The entire time we were just friends I knew I had made a mistake and spent the entire time trying to get the words and courage together to say something but just couldn’t do it. We no longer speak. My life is good, I’m happy but I wish things were different. I wish I was waking up next to someone else every morning. I always meant it when I said I wanted to have coffee with them every morning with our dogs, living a quiet life together until the end.

I won’t tell them this, I can’t ever tell them this. Besides, it would be like talking to a brick wall. If they are with a new person now, knowing I’m still out here feeling this way won’t make a difference. I know they hate me and never want to see me again. I don’t want to mess up their new life anyway.

My mom is in her late 70s and became disabled with chronic medical issues late in life. She told me once that she mourns the life she could have lived, never did and now never will. She told me she wishes she could have made better decisions so she wasn’t in a place now where she couldn’t change anything. I don’t want that to be me.

I guess if I knew someone felt this way about me I would hold onto them for dear life and never let go. Maybe it’s me who is the odd one out. I don’t know anymore. I don’t want to hurt anyone else.

I've been working on a side project that tackles a problem I personally struggled with: understanding the real long-term impact of my financial decisions.

**What it is:** WealthVision - a collection of interactive financial calculators that show how daily habits and investment decisions compound over time.

**The hook:** People can see in real-time how their €5 daily coffee habit could become €149k in 10 years if invested instead (at 7% returns). Or how much house they can afford based on their actual cashflow.

**Why I built it:**

* Most financial calculators are boring, hidden behind paywalls, or require signup
* People don't connect daily spending to long-term wealth loss
* Wanted something visual and immediate that makes the ""aha"" moment happen

**Key features:**

* 100% free, no signup required
* Real market data (actual ETF performance, etc.)
* Privacy-first (no tracking)
* Multiple calculators for different life stages

**My question:** For those of you who've built similar tools or work in fintech - what's been your experience getting traction? I'm currently exploring affiliate partnerships to monetize without charging users.

1r0atnb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0atnb,Does this connection have long-term potential?,"I met him completely by chance while I was at the theatre with friends, at a moment when I had pretty much given up on relationships. I am person B in the synastry. As we were leaving, he stopped me on the stairs to ask for my number…He said he couldn’t help himself, acting a bit out of character, even if his family was there.

He was in town for just a couple of days visiting family, he moved abroad a long time ago. We met 2 days later for coffee, and we ended up seeing each other two days in a row before he left. The second date lasted from lunch to dinner and it was magical, also probably because we were both in our hometown (I also lived abroad for the past decade and moved back temporarily a few months ago.) About a month later, he came to visit me and spent the weekend at my place.

What really stands out is how easy everything feels. I’ve never felt so relaxed and comfortable with someone so quickly, and feel like it’s easy to be really intimate with him (emotionally and even physically, our first time having sex felt more like making love and it was different from everything I’ve experienced before.) And we both have the sense that we’ve known each other for a long time.

I do see potential here, but I’m also curious about the nature of this connection. Is this something that could grow into something lasting, or is it more of a meaningful encounter meant to teach us something? I’d love to hear if our synastry offers any insight into why this feels so familiar and where it might be headed. Also considering that we currently live in different countries.

This working week has got off to a pretty boring start and it feels like now is the perfect time to begin my quest to find someone new to hopefully start building something with throughout the rest of the week and beyond!

I’m 33, male and from the UK. London to be a little more precise! I work as an aircraft engineer. I know this isn’t the most interesting job in the world, but it does allow me to travel a fair bit.  

Random info about me - I’m convinced I’ll eventually die due to one of the Big 3 Cs: coffee, cheese, or chocolate. No regrets, honestly! Away from that, in terms of hobbies I like the following:

- Travel (I get great travel benefits because of my job, so this is always something that I try to make the most).
- Keeping fit and healthy (I do find this a bit of a chore, but it definitely helps me stay mentally positive!).
- Visiting new restaurants and other places to eat (This is something I absolutely love doing. Trying dishes from different cultures is probably my number one ambition in life!)
- Theme parks (There are some great ones in Europe, but one day I dream of visiting some of the American parks too!)

I think that will do for now. If you think that I’m maybe worth a message, then please feel free to drop me one.

Most habit apps only focus on “good” habits (drink water, meditate, work out…). But in real life, especially depending on where you live, there are:

* Habits you’d like to **do less** of (late dinners, smoking with coffee, constant food delivery, doomscrolling, energy drinks, etc.)
* Habits you’d like to **do more** of (evening walks, family meals, local markets, morning yoga, reading, etc.)

I’m running a **Cultural Habits Challenge** to build a library of habits that actually reflect how people live in different countries.

# What I’d love to hear from you

From your country / culture, could you share:

* **1 habit to LIMIT** 🔴
* **1 habit to IMPROVE** 🟢

For each one, if you can:

1. Name it in your own language
2. Give a short explanation in English
3. (Optional) Say what physical object it’s tied to in your life
   * e.g. phone, fridge, coffee machine, car, front door, desk, bed, shoes…

Example (Spain):

* 🔴 LIMIT: **“Cenar demasiado tarde”** – eating dinner very late (23:00–00:00), bad for sleep
* 🟢 IMPROVE: **“Paseo vespertino”** – evening walk after dinner, great for digestion and mental health

# Why I’m asking

I’m building **TagTrack**, a “phygital” habit tracker for iOS that connects habits to **real objects** using NFC tags and QR codes. You stick tags on the things you already use (door, coffee machine, water bottle, etc.), and a single tap or scan logs the habit.

I want the preset habit library to be:

* Less “generic self‑help”, more **real life**
* Honest about what people struggle with in their culture
* Grounded in habits that are tied to **objects and routines** that already exist

You don’t need to use the app or care about NFC to reply.  
Even **one** pair of habits (1 to limit / 1 to improve) from your country helps a lot.

Now, this lady visits the kiosk around 10-15 times every single day when she takes the dog for a walk and sometimes also when coming back from the walk, to buy cigarettes, beer or coffee. Every time she visits the kiosk, the dog is tied up outside - usually for several minutes while she is inside - and the dog will start barking relentlessly as soon as it has been tied up. Sometimes it even keeps barking after she comes out while she is standing around talking to people. It doesn't seem to bother her at all.

I tried to talk to her once about it but she doesn't seem to understand English and I don't speak good enough German. Also it's worth noting that she is the type of person who hangs out at the local kneipe a lot, and seem to know all the local ""street people"", so I'm a bit afraid that starting a conflict with her will only making things worse.

The loud dog is really bothering both my partner and I who both work a lot from home. All in all it's a issue all day every day, and the shape of our square probably makes it even louder. Sometimes it's as late as midnight when we're trying to sleep.  
Is there anything we can do? Can the police be involved when we don't know the name or the address of the lady? Is having a loud dog even illegal?",0,1770658649.0,AskAGerman,9,0.22,False
1r0aq78,https://i.redd.it/dfjeamd46iig1.jpeg,Global News Summary — 9 February 2026,"# 🧭 Main Headline — Rising Geopolitical Tensions & Political Shifts Worldwide

Here’s a clear, up-to-date **Global News Summary (as of February 9 2026)** covering the most significant developments across key domains — politics, economy, environment, health, and social issues — with a *featured visual* to highlight the top story. Global headlines today are driven by renewed Middle East diplomacy and war-risk signaling, continued pressure on Ukraine’s infrastructure, and unstable markets after last week’s AI/tech-led selloff and commodity whipsaws.

# 🏛️ Politics & International Relations

* **Major Elections Reshape Political Landscapes:**
   * Portugal elected Socialist António José Seguro as president in a landslide — signaling a shift away from far-right politics.
   * Thailand’s conservative Bhumjaithai Party surged in elections, reshaping domestic governance debates.
* **Ukraine–Russia Peace Push:** Ukraine is calling for leader-level talks to finalize a potential peace agreement; prisoner exchanges suggest cautious progress amid unresolved territorial disputes.
* **Iran Tensions and Diplomacy:** Iran signaled openness to limiting uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief while also arresting reformist politicians amid unrest.
* **Hong Kong & Civil Liberties:** Media entrepreneur Jimmy Lai received a 20-year prison sentence under national security laws — a case closely watched by human-rights groups.
* **Middle East Developments:** Israel approved steps expanding West Bank settlement powers — raising concern about future peace prospects.
* **U.S.–Iran:** Multiple market and geopolitical briefings say U.S.–Iran nuclear diplomacy remains fragile, with investors and governments watching whether upcoming rounds produce “substantive” concessions or whether the region slides back toward escalation.
* **Ukraine:** Ongoing reporting continues to emphasize Russia’s repeated drone/missile strikes aimed at **Ukraine’s energy system**, keeping winter humanitarian risks high and shaping the backdrop for further negotiations.
* **Japan:** Reuters says Japan’s election result is expected to revive a “**Takaichi trade**,” with policy expectations (fiscal stance, reflation, and the yen) likely to ripple into global FX and rates markets.
* **U.S.–Russia arms-control era ends as New START expires** The last bilateral strategic-arms pact lapsed 2 Feb.; Washington rejected Moscow’s offer to extend caps for one year. Pentagon sources say the U.S. is considering a “rapid upload” of 200–300 stored warheads, while Congress debates an $18 billion nuclear-modernization surge. Analysts warn the absence of on-site inspections returns the two biggest arsenals to 1970s-level opacity .
* **Conservative Sweeps in Asia:** Snap elections in Japan and Thailand have yielded strong mandates for incumbent conservative parties.  In Japan, Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured a supermajority, while in Thailand, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul’s Bhumjaithai Party emerged dominant, signaling a regional preference for continuity amidst global instability.

**Context:** Political polarization, shifting alliances, and security concerns are driving both domestic and international policy changes.

# ⚔️ Conflict, Security & Humanitarian Issues

* **Sudan Civil War:** A drone attack killed at least 24 displaced civilians, highlighting one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises with millions displaced.
* **Military and Strategic Competition:** Global defense planning — including deployments in Asia-Pacific — reflects intensifying rivalry among major powers.
* **Global Security Dialogue:** Upcoming events like the Munich Security Conference are expected to address cyber threats, conflict risks, and global stability challenges.

**Context:** Armed conflicts and strategic competition remain central to international diplomacy and security planning.

# 💰 Economy & Global Markets

* **Political Events Affect Markets:** Japanese markets rallied following a political mandate, illustrating investor sensitivity to elections and policy stability.
* **Infrastructure & Aviation Developments:** Airport expansions and sustainable aviation initiatives show continued investment despite global uncertainty.
* **Emerging Global Economic Themes:** Growth remains uneven globally, with analysts highlighting geopolitical tensions and trade policies as key risks.
* **Growth vs. Protectionism:** Despite the highest U.S. tariff rates since the 1930s, the IMF has projected a global growth rate of 3% for 2026. Markets have shown surprising resilience, hitting all-time highs this week as nations largely avoided retaliatory ""trade wars"" in favor of maintaining WTO-based commerce.
* **The ""Post-Growth"" Debate:** A major discourse has erupted following a UN appeal by Secretary-General António Guterres to move ""beyond GDP.""[7](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2026/feb/09/economic-growth-carbon-emissions-impact-global-heating) Economists are increasingly debating whether true ""green growth""—decoupling economic expansion from carbon emissions—is a reality or a dangerous myth, as global CO2 levels reached new peaks alongside GDP in the past year
* Saxo’s market note points to a **semi-led U.S. rebound** (especially in semiconductors), Europe rallying with sharp dispersion, and Japan extending record strength post-election, while “downside protection” demand remains elevated ahead of key U.S. data.​
* IG’s weekly navigator says AI disruption fears **hammered U.S. software stocks** last week and hit Hong Kong equities and bitcoin, while the **Dow rose 2.5%** (briefly above 50,000) even as the Nasdaq lagged—an unusually split tape.​
* Strategy calendars highlight this week’s key catalyst set—**U.S. jobs and inflation data**—as central to the “jobs vs inflation” tradeoff and the path for rates and risk assets globally

**Context:** Economic outlook remains cautious amid political uncertainty and shifting global trade dynamics.

# 🌱 Environment & Climate

* **Economic Growth vs Climate Goals:** Experts warn global economic expansion still drives rising carbon emissions, complicating efforts to curb climate change.
* **Green Aviation & Sustainability:** Industry leaders emphasize the need for investment in sustainable aviation fuels and climate-friendly infrastructure.
* **Policy Focus:** Governments and businesses increasingly link environmental policy with economic resilience and security risks.
* FEWS NET’s current hazards outlook continues to flag **flooding risks** in parts of Africa/Asia and **drought stress** in East Africa and parts of Central America/Caribbean, with food-security implications that humanitarian agencies are monitoring closely.​
* Winter extremes remain a core risk theme in Europe and North America as polar-vortex dynamics continue to raise the probability of additional cold surges and disruptive storms later in February.
* **Regional Milestones:** Canada concluded its International Development Week with a focus on ""Climate Resilience"" partnerships, announcing new funds to support sustainable coffee-growing communities in the Global South.
*  

**Context:** Climate issues are moving from environmental concerns into mainstream economic and geopolitical discussions.

# 🏥 Health & Social Issues

* **Protests and Social Tensions:** Demonstrations tied to environmental and political concerns occurred alongside international events like the Winter Olympics.
* **Public Concerns & Inequality:** Surveys show economic stability, healthcare access, and social inequality remain top worries worldwide.
* **Humanitarian Conditions:** Ongoing conflicts continue to create displacement, healthcare shortages, and food insecurity in crisis regions.
* **WHO’s $1 Billion Appeal:** The World Health Organization launched a massive $1 billion funding appeal today to address widening gaps in healthcare access for millions living in conflict zones.  The agency warned that declining international aid is leaving populations in Yemen and Sudan vulnerable to preventable disease and malnutrition.
* **Digital Identity Crisis:** Social issues took a digital turn as high-profile cases of ""identity hijacking"" reached the courts in the U.S. and Europe. In Michigan, a landmark impact statement was delivered by a teen whose life was upended by an online impersonator, highlighting the growing need for global legal frameworks to combat deepfake-driven harassment.
* **Justice Reform:** The Czech government moved to expand the legal definition of human trafficking and began a major overhaul of its penal system to prioritize alternative punishments like home confinement over traditional incarceration.

**Context:** Social and health challenges are closely tied to economic pressures and geopolitical instability.

# 🧾 Key Takeaways (Global Outlook)

* Elections and geopolitical rivalries are reshaping alliances and domestic politics.
* Conflicts in regions like Sudan and Ukraine remain major humanitarian and security concerns.
* Economic growth faces headwinds from political uncertainty and climate pressures.
* Climate policy and sustainability are increasingly central to economic planning.
* Social unrest and inequality continue to influence political discourse worldwide.",1,1770658641.0,u_minimarketuk,0,1.0,False

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly
* NOT a cigarette smoker!

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

He knows her schedule. Her morning coffee order. The way she looks when she sleeps.

ICU nurse Ava Morrison is used to long nights, difficult patients, and the constant hum of machines keeping people alive. What she's not used to is the feeling that someone is watching her.

It starts small. Keys not quite where she left them. A granola bar on her windshield that she didn't buy. A note in handwriting she doesn't recognize.

Then someone makes tea in her apartment while she's in the shower.

The police can't help her — not without a suspect, not without proof that meets their threshold. So Ava does what she's always done: she handles it herself. She changes her locks. Installs a camera. Builds a fortress around a life that's shrinking by the day.

But he's already inside.

And by the time she sees the truth, it's already too late.

The philosophy is simple: everyone contributes, engineers stay in control. PMs, founders and non‑core devs can propose and iterate on changes, while the core team keeps full ownership through normal review workflows, tests and CI. No giant rewrites, no AI black box repo, just more momentum on the code you already have.

We are currently at around 13K MRR

Curious how others here think about this space: are you seeing more “AI on top of existing codebases” versus greenfield AI dev tools in your projects? And if you’re interested in how we run an 8‑person, fully committed, bootstrapped team around this (stack, pricing, customer segment, mistakes), happy to share more.

1r0ak8g,https://i.redd.it/9pd9for08iig1.png,"Using NFC + QR to track cultural habits – 1 to limit 🔴, 1 to improve 🟢","Hey r/NFC,

I’m the developer of **TagTrack**, an iOS habit tracker that uses **NFC tags** and **QR codes** to turn real‑world objects into “habit buttons”.

The idea is simple:

* Stick an NFC tag or QR code on your **door, coffee machine, water bottle, dumbbells, running shoes, etc.**
* Tap it (NFC) or point your camera at it (QR)
* ✅ Your habit is instantly logged – no app navigation, no list scrolling

I’m launching a **Cultural Habits Challenge** and thought this sub might appreciate the phygital angle.

# What’s new technically

Until now, TagTrack was NFC‑first. In the next few days I’m shipping a new **1‑tap QR mode**:

* A dedicated **Scan view** that auto-detects TagTrack QR codes in front of the camera
* Launchable directly from **Lock Screen / StandBy / widgets**
* Flow is basically:
   1. Tap widget
   2. Camera opens
   3. Point at QR on your object
   4. Habit tracked

It’s almost as fast as NFC in practice, and works with cheap printed stickers.

So whether you’re into NFC tags or QR labels, you can bind habits to physical anchors.

# Cultural Habits Challenge (where I need your help)

I want to build a **Cultural Habits Library** inside the app, based on real habits from different countries.

From your culture/country, I’m looking for just **2 habits**:

* **1 habit to LIMIT** 🔴 (something people do too much of)
* **1 habit to IMPROVE** 🟢 (a tradition/ritual worth doing more)

For each habit, please share:

1. Country / culture
2. Name in your language
3. Short EN explanation
4. Which **object** you’d tag (door, fridge, phone, coffee machine, steering wheel, desk, shoes, etc.)

Example (France):

* 🔴 LIMIT: **“Clope avec le café”** – cigarette with coffee, tag on the cigarette pack or ashtray
* 🟢 IMPROVE: **“Aller chercher la baguette à pied”** – walking to the bakery to get bread, tag near the front door

I’ll group similar answers and turn some of them into **built‑in presets** under a new *Cultural Habits* section in TagTrack.

If I add your idea, I’ll DM you a **1‑week premium code** as a thank you.

If you have a cool idea for an NFC/QR‑friendly habit in your culture (good or bad), I’d love to see it.

My fear is that this will happen again because the screws get wet during every brew cycle - the screws are inside gray the shower head assembly.

We’d been texting for about a week, and I genuinely thought she could be the kind of woman I’m looking for. She goes to the gym, is building her own house, works and studies at the same time, she’s kind… and what impressed me the most is that she cancelled our first date because of work issues but immediately rescheduled. That’s not something I’m used to, unfortunately. Most women I’ve dated just cancel and disappear, so that stood out to me in a good way.

We eventually met for coffee. She looked like her pictures, but… I don’t know. I wasn’t fully attracted to her appearance. I know this sounds shallow or mean, and I feel bad even saying it. She did have beautiful curls, nice makeup, and really lovely eyes tho. The conversation itself was fine, too. I got to know that she’s never had a boyfriend and, given her traits so far, I thought that was odd. She claimed that she didn’t meet good men, but that she learned from that. She was interesting and had a good sense of humor, though she was fidgeting a lot the whole time and couldn’t keep much eye contact.

When I walked her to her car, things got a bit awkward during the goodbye. She was looking at my lips, and I’m pretty sure she was going in for a kiss. I wanted to kiss her too, but somehow we both hesitated and ended up with a kiss on the cheek. I don’t think either of us was sure what the other wanted. She told me to text her when I got home. I completely forgot, and she ended up messaging me first:

*“Let me know when you get home safely, please. Thanks for the coffee! I hope you had a nice time.”*

Then she asked if I’d like to go out again. I replied:

*“Maybe. Honestly, I’m not sure.”*

She answered:

*“No, I understand. I* ***would*** *like to see you again. If you ever feel like it, let me know.”*

Now I’m stuck. I don’t know why I’m not feeling much. It’s like I didn’t feel that spark on the first date, and I really don’t want to lead her on.",2,1770658194.0,relationship_advice,8,0.75,False

I’m one of the founders of [Kosuke.ai](http://Kosuke.ai), a SaaS we’re building as a full‑time, bootstrapped, no investors team of 8 living and working together in a small (very very small but full of coffee) house in Milan since November 2025. We started as a CTO‑as‑a‑Service for early‑stage teams, but after a few months it became obvious that the most used and loved part of the product was the collaboration layer on top of existing codebases.

So we doubled down and built what is basically “Lovable for existing products”: a way to enable everyone to contribute to an existing repo without trashing quality. You import your codebase, describe changes in plain English, and our AI writes code that follows your existing conventions, patterns and architecture, so engineers review clean PRs instead of rewriting everything.

The philosophy is simple: everyone contributes, engineers stay in control.

1r0ahyv,https://i.redd.it/ycj4h79o7iig1.jpeg,23M Looking to vibe with online pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance \*cough\*.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

From 2020 to 2023, by God’s grace, we were able to generate ₱100M+ in accumulated revenue. In 2024, I had to pause operations due to a personal loss that needed my full presence. It wasn’t about the market or the business, it was about life.

Now, I’m ready to stand up again.

The demand is still here. Same niche, wide market, and there’s already around ₱10M worth of projects waiting once we restart. Our systems and processes are intact, and with the right partner, we can strengthen and scale them further.

I’m not chasing quick money, so pass po muna sa sobrang tataas na interest, lenders, and easy money mindset na investors. 

I’m opening this to a genuine angel investor or co-owner who values rebuilding, long-term growth, and doing business the right way.

I am open to a sit-down meeting, either a casual coffee or a meeting at the physical office I’ve already established. I’d recommend we talk face-to-face, walk you through the story, the numbers, and the vision.

If this resonates with you, feel free to DM me. Even a conversation means a lot.

I've been playing for two months now and the game is lovely, I understand why it's so popular. However, because of that I'm even more surprised by lots of wasted potential here!

So, to rant about some stuff.. The island feels empty. Few buildings and not too many residents. Not many activities (such as inviting someone to coffee or some sports mini games). Animals' personalities are very repetitive and make me feel lonely after meeting a few. And why in the world the ones in campsite don't wanna stay if I don't beg them 40 times!

I can feel the goal here is to play with friends and decorate lots of empty land, while decorating around buildings is so much more fun for me.

I’m based between the North West and West Midlands and ideally would love to meet people locally, but I’m also happy to travel a bit if needed. Somewhat around my age would be good, but I'm cool as long as 18+ as the connection is more important!

I'd describe myself as easy going, a little introverted, and can be a bit shy to start with, but soon open up once I’m comfortable. Ideally, I’d like to start by chatting online and, if we get on, meet up in real life. I’m looking for something long-term and a genuine mate or two.

Into hiking, nature, and getting outdoors.

Also enjoy watching the F1, reading, history, and cooking. Like travelling, exploring new places, and learning languages too.

Would be happy to just chat, meet for a drink or coffee, explore somewhere new, do a hike together... Up for different plans!

If you're looking for something similar and are interested, feel free to message me!

How is anyone actually finding the time?!!,"I’ve been tracking some data recently that’s honestly a bit overwhelming for anyone trying to build a brand: there’s been a 52% year-over-year increase in posts from CEOs and founders. On top of that, **82% of people say they trust a company more when the founder is active.**

The ""Founder-Led Brand"" isn't a luxury anymore; it’s the standard.

The data says we need to post. The reality is that sitting down to write after a full day of work is exhausting. I’ve found that some of my best ideas happen when I’m away from my desk. I might be walking, driving, or just making coffee. By the time I sit down to type, the ""spark"" is gone and the post ends up sounding like a generic corporate bot, or I spend 1 hour just to write something nice that I actually like, not even talking about visuals... that's maybe 1 or 2 more hours on Figma or Canva to come up with something I really like.

**So I decided to solve this for myself.** I’m currently in the middle of a ""6 startups in 12 months"" challenge, and my first project, TalkToPost, is born out of this exact frustration.

It’s an AI-powered bridge that takes my messy, rambling voice notes and turns them into high-converting LinkedIn carousels and posts (also works great for X content). The goal was simple: **Zero friction between having an idea and having a finished asset.**

**I'm opening up the first 10 spots today.** I’m looking for 10 people who are tired of the ""content treadmill"" and want to start ""talking"" their posts into existence. I want 10 real users who are actually going to use this to grow their own personal brands this week.

I’m not dropping the link in the post because I want to keep the group small and focused. If you’re a founder or builder who has been sitting on ideas because you don’t have time to write them, drop a comment below. I’ll DM the access link to the first 10 people who are ready to ship their next post today.

i’m struggling with what feels like an executive dysfunction. i used to blame it on depression, or blame it on not being disciplined enough. but it’s gotten to the point where it genuinely feels impossible. there is SO many things i want for myself, so many things i want to do, routines i would love to have, just being the best version of myself. and it feels like i’m trying to climb mt everest in flip flops. my family is on me CONSTANTLY and it feels like they resent me for not being able to help out sometimes, or them just thinking i’m lazy. i don’t get much support there, i’m just yelled at about everything and criticized, and almost broken down. and nothing ever feels good enough. i try to explain what i’m feeling internally and i feel so misunderstood. if this makes sense, there’s so much i want to do but i genuinely can’t leave my bed or get anything done. i know im capable, and when it matters i can get shit done, but in the interim.. i feel fucking disabled and i’m not even trying to be funny. i need a celsius and a coffee everyday just to feel that rush of adrenaline to feel like i can get things done. and it’s not that i even feel “depressed” or sad everyday because i don’t, being sad for me doesn’t just come out of the blue, it’s situational. my space is constantly a mess, school work feels impossible, routines are so hard, i feel so sensitive to EVERYTHING. i know that i’m a smart and capable person, but no matter how much discipline i try to instill or routines i try to follow it never works. my brain feels like it’s everywhere all the time and foggy. like this struggle for me gives me suicidal idealization a lot, and i think that just shows how extremely hard this is for me.

i have an appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist, after not really being inclined to see one because i feel like i’m constantly misdiagnosed. i’ve been diagnosed with everything under the sun and it’s exhausting being told you’re this and you’re that, and take this and take that and maybe just MAYBE you won’t want to kys. i understand why you shouldn’t self diagnose, but at the same time… i feel like you know yourself the best even though it can be bias. all meds i’ve been prescribed feel like they never do anything for me. i’ve done my fair share of research on mental health, i’m going to bring up ADHD to my psychiatrist. by everything ive noticed, i feel like that’s the only diagnosis that suits me at this point and it’s just gotten wrong this entire time. and it’s more about feeling better over diagnosis for me, but at the same time you need a diagnosis to get meds to feel better. my appointment is in 9 days so wish me luck!",3,1770657827.0,mentalhealth,3,1.0,False

3 pens? 3 medicine tablet? Messy couch? Shared coffee? Empty joy? So now what? Cackling all day? Go ahead, do so. It’s not my throat that’s going to hurt. I’m not fake like you.

You “silently” move, walk like a “cat” to drop and do those *clues*.

Maybe I fucking should type and type so you won’t stop cackling. After all you seem to enjoy cackling.

I fucking hate you.

I fucking hate you from my core.

I honestly don’t have any recollection of good times with you.

You are the one who cannot accept the truth that that’s how you were and are to me. How I experienced you and continue to experience.

You can continue to cough all you want, I don’t have any empathy left for you.

You are a stranger to me. 

If someone were to ask me who the fuck you are, my answer would be *the woman who gave “birth” to me.* That is if I am her real daughter so who knows.

My *mask* about you had been off for quite some time. And now I am being punished for expressing myself about how I truly feel about it.

I fucking hate you for dismissing me every time I want to confide with you emotionally.

I fucking hate you for mocking everything I am.

I fucking hate you.

I don’t have any patience or understanding left for you.

Evaluation: i failed again right?

I am fucking okay with it because at least I get to release this shit off my chest.

You don’t know shit about me. You just know fragments.

How would you know? you never really talk to me on emotional level ever since my pre-teens era. Fucking never. if you read my “*autobiography”* as if i’d let you…you wouldn’t even know things happened to me. Good and bad. 

Cough cough cough, you need meds? Water? Ask your other daughters. They’re great and empathetic Reliable right?

you talk to me like I am your personal maid instead of being your daughter. Especially when we moved here. Every time you talk to me or ask your permission on things, there’s always a fucking catch.

Have you even noticed how my eyes look like lately? 

Unlike ***him*** I don’t hate or avoid looking at me infront of a mirror. I, as much try to look at me closely and observe the changes it went through the past few years.

The subtle wrinkle around my eyes when I genuinely smile or feeling happy, it’s not there anymore. That ***light*** I used to have, it’s not there anymore.

1r0a5wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1r0a5wi/my_girlfriend_made_me_promise_never_to_say_her/,My Girlfriend Made Me Promise Never to Say Her Name Again,"It started the night I told her I loved her.

We were still tangled up, sweaty in that gross way the sheets never quite forgive. The blinds in my room don’t close all the way, so a thin stripe of streetlight kept sliding across the ceiling every time a car went by.

Her cheek was on my chest. I could feel her breathing slow down.

Then she lifted her head and looked at me like she’d been holding a question in her mouth for hours.

“Promise me something,” she said.

I laughed under my breath. I don’t even know why. I was just… happy. “Sure.”

“Never say my name again.”

I waited for her to smile.

She didn’t.

“Not out loud,” she said. “Not in a text. Not written down. Nothing.”

The way she said it made my smile fade. Not all at once. Just enough.

“Why?” I asked.

She touched my cheek, fingertips cold compared to my skin, like she was checking I was still there.

“Because every time you say it, you hand a piece of me back to the world,” she whispered. “If you stop, it stays with you. Just you.”

And this is the part that makes me feel stupid now. It didn’t sound crazy. Not then. It sounded intimate. Like she was asking for something sacred.

I nodded. “Okay. I promise.”

Her shoulders dropped like she’d been holding her breath for days. She leaned forward and kissed me, slow and grateful.

“Thank you,” she murmured against my mouth. “Don’t break it.”

The first few days were strange in an almost sweet way.

I stopped using her name and started reaching for her instead. Hand on her lower back when she passed me in the kitchen. Fingers sliding into hers on the couch. Little touches just to replace the word.

I noticed things I’d never named before. How she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was thinking. The tiny freckle near her collarbone. The way she always stepped around a crack in the hallway tile like it bothered her.

She seemed calmer. Like her body was finally unclenching.

Every time I almost slipped, she would glance over at me. Not angry. Relieved when I caught myself.

Like silence was medicine.

On the third day, it stopped feeling like a private thing between us.

We went to our usual coffee place. Same barista, same little stickers on the cups, same bitter smell that clung to your hoodie even after you left.

The barista handed me two drinks.

Mine had my name on it.

The second cup had a sharpie streak where the name should have been. Not blank like she forgot, but smeared, as if the pen kept skipping over the same spot.

I held it up. “You missed hers.”

The barista frowned at the screen and tapped it twice. “There’s only one name on the order.”

I pulled up the app. Our saved order was there, the same one I’d used a dozen times. Two names at the top.

Except there weren’t.

My name was there.

Her side was empty. Not deleted. Not glitched out. Just a smooth blank field, like nobody had ever typed anything into it. The little profile photo was still her smiling face, so the emptiness looked deliberate, like someone had cut a hole out of the page.

The barista leaned forward and squinted. “Huh. That’s… weird.”

It didn’t feel weird. It felt wrong. Like stepping on a stair that isn’t there.

I got home and showed my girlfriend the screen.

She didn’t look surprised. She didn’t even lean in.

She just asked, “Did you say it?”

“No,” I said.

She nodded once. “Okay.”

And the relief on her face made my stomach turn.

A few days later my brother texted me an old picture from last summer. Us at the lake. She was laughing in my arms, hair stuck to her cheek, the sun turning the water white behind us.

His message said: Good times with you and her.

Just “her.” Not a typo. Not his style.

I opened my camera roll and scrolled back to that day. The photo was there. All of them were.

But the caption I’d written was gone.

Not edited. Not replaced.

Gone, like it never existed.

I opened the comments on the post I’d shared. Friends had commented back then. People I hadn’t spoken to in years.

Their sentences had clean gaps in them, like someone had carefully removed a single word with a razor blade. You could feel where it used to be.

I sat on the edge of the bed and kept scrolling, faster and faster, as if I could outrun it.

Every picture of us looked normal until you tried to point at her with language.

Then it all slid away.

She walked into the room while I was still staring at the screen.

I looked up at her.

She looked at me for a long second, then said quietly, like she was checking a lock.

“You didn’t say it.”

I shook my head because my throat had tightened so hard I couldn’t speak.

She sat beside me and put her hand on my knee. The weight of it felt comforting and possessive at the same time.

That night I tried to say her name alone, just once, just to prove I still could.

I stood in the bathroom with the door shut and stared at myself in the mirror. I opened my mouth and tried to shape the first sound.

Nothing came.

Not because I was refusing.

Because there was nothing to reach for. The word wasn’t hiding. It wasn’t stuck behind my teeth.

It just wasn’t there.

I stood there with my lips moving silently, like a person trying to speak underwater.

There was a soft knock on the door.

“You okay?” she asked.

I opened it.

She took one look at my face and stepped closer, touching my arm lightly, like she was calming a startled animal.

Her voice was gentle. “It’s okay,” she said.

She didn’t ask what happened.

She didn’t need to.

On the ninth day my mom called.

Her voice was shaky in a way I hadn’t heard since I was a kid.

“I was looking at your pictures,” she said. “Who’s the girl?”

My stomach dropped so hard I felt it in my knees.

“What do you mean,” I said, even though I knew.

“I see you with someone,” she whispered. “You look happy. But I can’t remember her name. I tried to tell your dad and it wouldn’t come out. It’s like… it’s like my mouth stops.”

I stared at my girlfriend across the living room. She was at the counter making tea like this was any other night, humming softly to herself.

I couldn’t answer my mom.

I told her I’d call her back and hung up.

I walked into the kitchen and said, “Stop.”

My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

My girlfriend turned, holding a mug with both hands, steam curling up past her face.

“I’m not doing anything,” she said.

“Then what is,” I asked, and my voice cracked on the last word.

She set the mug down carefully, like she didn’t want it to clink too loud.

“Your promise,” she said.

She said it like it wasn’t an argument. Like she was telling me what time it was.

The next morning I tried to leave.

Not dramatic. Not an argument. Just a quiet escape before my brain could rationalize it.

I packed a bag while she was in the shower. I moved as fast as I could, like speed mattered. Like the house itself might notice.

I wrote a note to myself on the kitchen table in thick marker.

GET OUT.

THE PROMISE IS DOING THIS.

I stood there for a second, staring at the words, trying to burn them into my head.

Then I went to grab my keys from the counter.

When I turned back, the note was blank.

Not torn up. Not flipped over.

Blank, like the ink had been sucked clean off the paper.

I picked it up and held it under the light. The paper was warm from my hand. There was no smear, no residue. Just white.

My bag slipped out of my fingers and hit the floor.

She came out of the bathroom a minute later, hair wrapped in a towel, face calm.

She stopped in the doorway and looked at the bag, then at me.

There was no anger. No panic. Just patience.

Like she’d been waiting for me to try.

She stepped closer, her footsteps quiet on the tile.

“Say it,” she whispered.

I opened my mouth.

Nothing.

She nodded, small and satisfied.

“Okay,” she said.

And then, like the conversation was over, she reached for my hand.

I took it.

I don’t know why. I hate that I took it.

Weeks went by.

I stopped calling people by name because it felt wrong coming out of my mouth. My mom’s name came out flat, like I was reading it off an envelope. My brother’s sounded borrowed.

Even my own name felt like something I used to answer to.

But when I looked at her, the feeling was still there. The familiarity. The warmth. The ache in my chest when she walked into a room.

Like she didn’t need a name because she was already inside the part of me that uses names.

She’s here now, as I write this.

She’s in the kitchen humming, moving like she owns the space. Every so often she stops, like she’s listening for something.

Sometimes at night she curls against me and whispers into my neck, “Do you still love me.”

And I say yes, because I do.

And because when I try to imagine any other answer, my mind slides away from it like it’s too smooth to hold.

Last week I found an old voicemail I’d saved from the first month we were together. Back when her contact still had a name. Back when it was normal to say it and feel like you were calling someone home.

I played it sitting on the kitchen floor with the lights off.

Her voice was bright. Laughing. “Hey,” she said. “Call me back.”

A pause.

Then, quieter, like she leaned close to the phone.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

Static.

And at the very end, almost buried under it, there was another voice.

Mine.

Warm. Easy. Loving.

Saying her name.

Clear as day.

I played it again.

And again.

The more I listened, the less it sounded like something I remembered doing.

It sounded like me, but not like something I remembered doing.

Like someone learning the shape of a word they didn’t want to lose.

I stopped the voicemail and sat there in the dark with the phone in my hand.

In the other room, my girlfriend stopped humming.

For a long moment there was only silence.

Then, softly, from the kitchen, she said, almost to herself:

“Good.”

And I realized something that made my stomach go cold.

I don’t think she’s erasing herself.

I think she’s taking the part of me that knows how to keep someone real.

And once she has enough of it, she won’t need the name at all.",2,1770657464.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1r0a5nq,https://i.redd.it/ze3guc0k4iig1.png,"Paul Flynn Exposed: The “Sir” Title, CO₂ Claims & GRO Token Red Flags","I’m writing this as someone who is still part of the Broke 2 Boss community and who has followed Paul Flynn closely.

What immediately stands out is how hard Paul pushes his “Sir” title to create instant credibility. It’s a shortcut to authority. But once you dig deeper, the story doesn’t match the image. His so-called consulting experience seems to come from a basic desk job — yet it’s marketed like elite leadership.

He also claims he was responsible for investments for the Scottish Prime Minister. That’s a huge statement. Where’s the proof?

Then came the split with Thaddaeus: first they promoted each other, then they publicly accused one another, and right after that Paul rebranded himself as the ethical “good guy.” To me, this looks less like integrity and more like damage control.

Now the business logic:

If carbon credits / CO₂ certificates are such a massive market —  
why suddenly a *coffee community*?

If the GRO token is backed by carbon certificates —  
why were there no verified credits?

If buyers were ready —  
why was GRO delayed from 2024 to 2025?

What exactly was supposed to back this crypto token investment?

From my perspective this follows a familiar pattern seen in many crypto scams and investment schemes: big titles, big promises, shifting narratives, and projects that are always “launching soon.”

I’m not here to insult anyone. People put real money and trust into this.

Judy was there both times, clearing tables, refilling coffee, running the register, and taking selfies with customers. My view is that anyone who can generate this level of excitement for visiting Galesburg deserves a statue in Central Park. Surely the people coming for breakfast from out of town are spending money at some of the other local establishments, right?

The idea:
A companionship service where people can book a paid date/companion for things like:
	•	Coffee or dinner
	•	Attending events or social outings
	•	Casual conversation / emotional companionship

How it would work:
	•	Women onboard voluntarily after verification
	•	Clear code of conduct for both parties
	•	Dates happen only in public places
	•	Ongoing checks + feedback after each booking
	•	Tiered pricing (₹3k / ₹5k / ₹7k per date depending on duration & profile)
	•	Revenue split: 50% platform, 50% companion

Concerns I’m actively thinking about:
	•	Safety (for women especially)
	•	Misuse or boundary-pushing by customers
	•	Legal/regulatory clarity
	•	Social stigma and perception

1r09vh7,https://webapp2.wright.edu/web1/newsroom/2026/02/06/from-barista-to-ceo/,ReyRey Café: From barista to CEO,"We talk a lot about going further at Wright State University. It’s not because it’s something we aspire to; it’s a reflection of who we are. We’re motivated to achieve and driven to dream. And we attract people to our community who aspire to achieve more. People like Rahul Balami.

Balami is a second-year [accounting](https://business.wright.edu/finance-accountancy-management-information-systems-and-economics/bachelor-of-science-in-business-accountancy-major) and [finance](https://business.wright.edu/finance-accountancy-management-information-systems-and-economics/bachelor-of-science-in-business-finance-major) major from Chitlang, Nepal, who has always believed that taking small steps forward will lead to big adventures — and his first step toward Wright State was an internet search.

“I first searched all over the U.S. and started focusing on Missouri and Ohio because of affordability,” said Balami. “I found Wright State and saw how the [business college](https://business.wright.edu/) highlighted their student experiences, student opportunities and projects. And they had a student-run cafe. I knew I wanted to work there from the beginning.”

So Balami started taking steps. Before completing an English exam or applying to Wright State, he signed up to learn more about coffee during a gap year.

“I’m really passionate about coffee. I have been since childhood,” said Balami, and knowing a possible opportunity existed when he arrived at Wright State was more than enough reason for Balami to step through the doors of Nepal’s Himalayan Java Barista Coffee School.

It paid off. During his first semester at Wright State, he overcame some challenges and landed the job he wanted.

“My English wasn’t great, but professors were supportive and there was a lot of other help,” said Balami. “And when the students saw how passionate I was about coffee and was an [international](https://www.wright.edu/international-education) business student, they hired me as a barista my first semester.”

From there, it was Balami’s drive and character that led the way. After witnessing his work, care and kindness with customers, intelligence, and drive, he was named chief financial officer.

His work conducting cost analysis and streamlining budgeting helped improve profits for the business, and in one more semester, Balami was selected as the leader and CEO of ReyRey Café, which[ celebrated its 10-year anniversary and new location in Dunbar Library](https://webapp2.wright.edu/web1/newsroom/2026/01/28/student-run-reyrey-cafe-celebrates-decade-of-entrepreneurship-at-wright-state/) in January.

Wright State is the perfect size for opportunities like this to happen, but they don’t happen to just anyone. You definitely have to take the right steps. And even though he seemed to make it happen incredibly fast, it started with small steps in Nepal.

It’s a lesson that Balami learned from his own family: his father, a small-business owner, and his mother, whom he describes with a smile as a traditional — but very independent — woman who does a lot of service work, farms and gardens.

Balami said he won’t see his family in person until he graduates with his two majors in 2028, but he is already taking his next steps forward from ReyRey Café. Although he will complete this semester as CEO, he’s already begun an accounting internship that he learned about from an accounting lecturer who is a regular at the cafe.

“I’ve loved working at ReyRey, but I need to explore. I need to expand my limits,” said Balami, who hasn’t decided what his final destination will be. “I’m still exploring my decisions, but I don’t have to decide that now. I just need to determine what I can do better today.”

In your arms, swaddled and quiet was our newly born child. I smiled and lay back in the uncomfortable hospital chair. It was February 6 2026, I think. As I drifted off for my first sleep in 36 hours I thought of the journey we'd been on and how we arrived at the maternity Hospital, six miles from the centre of London but light years away from the tourists of Big Ben, nestled in the centre of a foredt.

2024 had ended badly for both of us. You can tell me your back story when we chat but in my case I'd had a horrible break up. Although my girlfriend had not been physically abusive, it has been tough. I'd finally left when money which was allocated to a honeymoon disappeared from our joint account.

I'd managed to find a place to live, a few hundred meters from the forest and running slowly in the mud was a lovely escape. I'm a little overweight and not exactly athletic but I was improving. A real impetus to run was that this equally chubby but beautiful woman seemed to run in the same place as me. I'd seen her on Wood Street getting coffee and we always seemed to time our runs so we were out at the same time. 

in the run up to Christmas it was muddy and we ended up having to walk through a particularly difficult spot. After weeks of silence, we finally exchanged words. We started to run together a little: maybe we could get a coffee after the run. As we slowly jogged, there was chemistry. I felt a happiness I'd not known in months. 

However, a tree root abruptly inserted itself between your foot and our happy jog, leaving you a muddy, painful mess on the ground.

Three hours later, I was getting terrible coffee outside the emergency department and buying magazines. Your wrist would require surgery. I felt a responsibility to wait with you. I smiled a little too long when you mocked my choice of magazines. Our hands lingered in each other's a tiny bit longer than they needed to when I helped you up to be transferred to another department.

This is a very brief outline of my roleplay idea. Just a really boring couple. Not classically attractive but who love each other. They meet in adversity but over the next few months they fall in love. This is all up for negotiation. It's your story too. If you're interested, please message me.

1r09ump,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r09ump/my_girlfriend_made_me_promise_never_to_say_her/,My Girlfriend Made Me Promise Never to Say Her Name Again.,"It started the night I told her I loved her.

We were still tangled up, sweaty in that gross way the sheets never quite forgive. The blinds in my room don’t close all the way, so a thin stripe of streetlight kept sliding across the ceiling every time a car went by.

Her cheek was on my chest. I could feel her breathing slow down.

Then she lifted her head and looked at me like she’d been holding a question in her mouth for hours.

“Promise me something,” she said.

I laughed under my breath. I don’t even know why. I was just… happy. “Sure.”

“Never say my name again.”

I waited for her to smile.

She didn’t.

“Not out loud,” she said. “Not in a text. Not written down. Nothing.”

The way she said it made my smile fade. Not all at once. Just enough.

“Why?” I asked.

She touched my cheek, fingertips cold compared to my skin, like she was checking I was still there.

“Because every time you say it, you hand a piece of me back to the world,” she whispered. “If you stop, it stays with you. Just you.”

And this is the part that makes me feel stupid now. It didn’t sound crazy. Not then. It sounded intimate. Like she was asking for something sacred.

I nodded. “Okay. I promise.”

Her shoulders dropped like she’d been holding her breath for days. She leaned forward and kissed me, slow and grateful.

“Thank you,” she murmured against my mouth. “Don’t break it.”

The first few days were strange in an almost sweet way.

I stopped using her name and started reaching for her instead. Hand on her lower back when she passed me in the kitchen. Fingers sliding into hers on the couch. Little touches just to replace the word.

I noticed things I’d never named before. How she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was thinking. The tiny freckle near her collarbone. The way she always stepped around a crack in the hallway tile like it bothered her.

She seemed calmer. Like her body was finally unclenching.

Every time I almost slipped, she would glance over at me. Not angry. Relieved when I caught myself.

Like silence was medicine.

On the third day, it stopped feeling like a private thing between us.

We went to our usual coffee place. Same barista, same little stickers on the cups, same bitter smell that clung to your hoodie even after you left.

The barista handed me two drinks.

Mine had my name on it.

The second cup had a sharpie streak where the name should have been. Not blank like she forgot, but smeared, as if the pen kept skipping over the same spot.

I held it up. “You missed hers.”

The barista frowned at the screen and tapped it twice. “There’s only one name on the order.”

I pulled up the app. Our saved order was there, the same one I’d used a dozen times. Two names at the top.

Except there weren’t.

My name was there.

Her side was empty. Not deleted. Not glitched out. Just a smooth blank field, like nobody had ever typed anything into it. The little profile photo was still her smiling face, so the emptiness looked deliberate, like someone had cut a hole out of the page.

The barista leaned forward and squinted. “Huh. That’s… weird.”

It didn’t feel weird. It felt wrong. Like stepping on a stair that isn’t there.

I got home and showed my girlfriend the screen.

She didn’t look surprised. She didn’t even lean in.

She just asked, “Did you say it?”

“No,” I said.

She nodded once. “Okay.”

And the relief on her face made my stomach turn.

A few days later my brother texted me an old picture from last summer. Us at the lake. She was laughing in my arms, hair stuck to her cheek, the sun turning the water white behind us.

His message said: Good times with you and her.

Just “her.” Not a typo. Not his style.

I opened my camera roll and scrolled back to that day. The photo was there. All of them were.

But the caption I’d written was gone.

Not edited. Not replaced.

Gone, like it never existed.

I opened the comments on the post I’d shared. Friends had commented back then. People I hadn’t spoken to in years.

Their sentences had clean gaps in them, like someone had carefully removed a single word with a razor blade. You could feel where it used to be.

I sat on the edge of the bed and kept scrolling, faster and faster, as if I could outrun it.

Every picture of us looked normal until you tried to point at her with language.

Then it all slid away.

She walked into the room while I was still staring at the screen.

I looked up at her.

She looked at me for a long second, then said quietly, like she was checking a lock.

“You didn’t say it.”

I shook my head because my throat had tightened so hard I couldn’t speak.

She sat beside me and put her hand on my knee. The weight of it felt comforting and possessive at the same time.

That night I tried to say her name alone, just once, just to prove I still could.

I stood in the bathroom with the door shut and stared at myself in the mirror. I opened my mouth and tried to shape the first sound.

Nothing came.

Not because I was refusing.

Because there was nothing to reach for. The word wasn’t hiding. It wasn’t stuck behind my teeth.

It just wasn’t there.

I stood there with my lips moving silently, like a person trying to speak underwater.

There was a soft knock on the door.

“You okay?” she asked.

I opened it.

She took one look at my face and stepped closer, touching my arm lightly, like she was calming a startled animal.

Her voice was gentle. “It’s okay,” she said.

She didn’t ask what happened.

She didn’t need to.

On the ninth day my mom called.

Her voice was shaky in a way I hadn’t heard since I was a kid.

“I was looking at your pictures,” she said. “Who’s the girl?”

My stomach dropped so hard I felt it in my knees.

“What do you mean,” I said, even though I knew.

“I see you with someone,” she whispered. “You look happy. But I can’t remember her name. I tried to tell your dad and it wouldn’t come out. It’s like… it’s like my mouth stops.”

I stared at my girlfriend across the living room. She was at the counter making tea like this was any other night, humming softly to herself.

I couldn’t answer my mom.

I told her I’d call her back and hung up.

I walked into the kitchen and said, “Stop.”

My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

My girlfriend turned, holding a mug with both hands, steam curling up past her face.

“I’m not doing anything,” she said.

“Then what is,” I asked, and my voice cracked on the last word.

She set the mug down carefully, like she didn’t want it to clink too loud.

“Your promise,” she said.

She said it like it wasn’t an argument. Like she was telling me what time it was.

The next morning I tried to leave.

Not dramatic. Not an argument. Just a quiet escape before my brain could rationalize it.

I packed a bag while she was in the shower. I moved as fast as I could, like speed mattered. Like the house itself might notice.

I wrote a note to myself on the kitchen table in thick marker.

GET OUT.

THE PROMISE IS DOING THIS.

I stood there for a second, staring at the words, trying to burn them into my head.

Then I went to grab my keys from the counter.

When I turned back, the note was blank.

Not torn up. Not flipped over.

Blank, like the ink had been sucked clean off the paper.

I picked it up and held it under the light. The paper was warm from my hand. There was no smear, no residue. Just white.

My bag slipped out of my fingers and hit the floor.

She came out of the bathroom a minute later, hair wrapped in a towel, face calm.

She stopped in the doorway and looked at the bag, then at me.

There was no anger. No panic. Just patience.

Like she’d been waiting for me to try.

She stepped closer, her footsteps quiet on the tile.

“Say it,” she whispered.

I opened my mouth.

Nothing.

She nodded, small and satisfied.

“Okay,” she said.

And then, like the conversation was over, she reached for my hand.

I took it.

I don’t know why. I hate that I took it.

Weeks went by.

I stopped calling people by name because it felt wrong coming out of my mouth. My mom’s name came out flat, like I was reading it off an envelope. My brother’s sounded borrowed.

Even my own name felt like something I used to answer to.

But when I looked at her, the feeling was still there. The familiarity. The warmth. The ache in my chest when she walked into a room.

Like she didn’t need a name because she was already inside the part of me that uses names.

She’s here now, as I write this.

She’s in the kitchen humming, moving like she owns the space. Every so often she stops, like she’s listening for something.

Sometimes at night she curls against me and whispers into my neck, “Do you still love me.”

And I say yes, because I do.

And because when I try to imagine any other answer, my mind slides away from it like it’s too smooth to hold.

Last week I found an old voicemail I’d saved from the first month we were together. Back when her contact still had a name. Back when it was normal to say it and feel like you were calling someone home.

I played it sitting on the kitchen floor with the lights off.

Her voice was bright. Laughing. “Hey,” she said. “Call me back.”

A pause.

Then, quieter, like she leaned close to the phone.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

Static.

And at the very end, almost buried under it, there was another voice.

Mine.

Warm. Easy. Loving.

Saying her name.

Clear as day.

I played it again.

And again.

The more I listened, the less it sounded like something I remembered doing.

It sounded like me, but not like something I remembered doing.

Like someone learning the shape of a word they didn’t want to lose.

I stopped the voicemail and sat there in the dark with the phone in my hand.

In the other room, my girlfriend stopped humming.

For a long moment there was only silence.

Then, softly, from the kitchen, she said, almost to herself:

“Good.”

And I realized something that made my stomach go cold.

I don’t think she’s erasing herself.

I think she’s taking the part of me that knows how to keep someone real.

We were still tangled up, sweaty in that gross way the sheets never quite forgive. The blinds in my room don’t close all the way, so a thin stripe of streetlight kept sliding across the ceiling every time a car went by.

Her cheek was on my chest. I could feel her breathing slow down.

Then she lifted her head and looked at me like she’d been holding a question in her mouth for hours.

“Promise me something,” she said.

I laughed under my breath. I don’t even know why. I was just… happy. “Sure.”

“Never say my name again.”

I waited for her to smile.

She didn’t.

“Not out loud,” she said. “Not in a text. Not written down. Nothing.”

The way she said it made my smile fade. Not all at once. Just enough.

“Why?” I asked.

She touched my cheek, fingertips cold compared to my skin, like she was checking I was still there.

“Because every time you say it, you hand a piece of me back to the world,” she whispered. “If you stop, it stays with you. Just you.”

And this is the part that makes me feel stupid now. It didn’t sound crazy. Not then. It sounded intimate. Like she was asking for something sacred.

I nodded. “Okay. I promise.”

Her shoulders dropped like she’d been holding her breath for days. She leaned forward and kissed me, slow and grateful.

“Thank you,” she murmured against my mouth. “Don’t break it.”

The first few days were strange in an almost sweet way.

I stopped using her name and started reaching for her instead. Hand on her lower back when she passed me in the kitchen. Fingers sliding into hers on the couch. Little touches just to replace the word.

I noticed things I’d never named before. How she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was thinking. The tiny freckle near her collarbone. The way she always stepped around a crack in the hallway tile like it bothered her.

She seemed calmer. Like her body was finally unclenching.

Every time I almost slipped, she would glance over at me. Not angry. Relieved when I caught myself.

Like silence was medicine.

On the third day, it stopped feeling like a private thing between us.

We went to our usual coffee place. Same barista, same little stickers on the cups, same bitter smell that clung to your hoodie even after you left.

The barista handed me two drinks.

Mine had my name on it.

The second cup had a sharpie streak where the name should have been. Not blank like she forgot, but smeared, as if the pen kept skipping over the same spot.

I held it up. “You missed hers.”

The barista frowned at the screen and tapped it twice. “There’s only one name on the order.”

I pulled up the app. Our saved order was there, the same one I’d used a dozen times. Two names at the top.

Except there weren’t.

My name was there.

Her side was empty. Not deleted. Not glitched out. Just a smooth blank field, like nobody had ever typed anything into it. The little profile photo was still her smiling face, so the emptiness looked deliberate, like someone had cut a hole out of the page.

The barista leaned forward and squinted. “Huh. That’s… weird.”

It didn’t feel weird. It felt wrong. Like stepping on a stair that isn’t there.

I got home and showed my girlfriend the screen.

She didn’t look surprised. She didn’t even lean in.

She just asked, “Did you say it?”

“No,” I said.

She nodded once. “Okay.”

And the relief on her face made my stomach turn.

A few days later my brother texted me an old picture from last summer. Us at the lake. She was laughing in my arms, hair stuck to her cheek, the sun turning the water white behind us.

His message said: Good times with you and her.

Just “her.” Not a typo. Not his style.

I opened my camera roll and scrolled back to that day. The photo was there. All of them were.

But the caption I’d written was gone.

Not edited. Not replaced.

Gone, like it never existed.

I opened the comments on the post I’d shared. Friends had commented back then. People I hadn’t spoken to in years.

Their sentences had clean gaps in them, like someone had carefully removed a single word with a razor blade. You could feel where it used to be.

I sat on the edge of the bed and kept scrolling, faster and faster, as if I could outrun it.

Every picture of us looked normal until you tried to point at her with language.

Then it all slid away.

She walked into the room while I was still staring at the screen.

I looked up at her.

She looked at me for a long second, then said quietly, like she was checking a lock.

“You didn’t say it.”

I shook my head because my throat had tightened so hard I couldn’t speak.

She sat beside me and put her hand on my knee. The weight of it felt comforting and possessive at the same time.

That night I tried to say her name alone, just once, just to prove I still could.

I stood in the bathroom with the door shut and stared at myself in the mirror. I opened my mouth and tried to shape the first sound.

Nothing came.

Not because I was refusing.

Because there was nothing to reach for. The word wasn’t hiding. It wasn’t stuck behind my teeth.

It just wasn’t there.

I stood there with my lips moving silently, like a person trying to speak underwater.

There was a soft knock on the door.

“You okay?” she asked.

I opened it.

She took one look at my face and stepped closer, touching my arm lightly, like she was calming a startled animal.

Her voice was gentle. “It’s okay,” she said.

She didn’t ask what happened.

She didn’t need to.

On the ninth day my mom called.

Her voice was shaky in a way I hadn’t heard since I was a kid.

“I was looking at your pictures,” she said. “Who’s the girl?”

My stomach dropped so hard I felt it in my knees.

“What do you mean,” I said, even though I knew.

“I see you with someone,” she whispered. “You look happy. But I can’t remember her name. I tried to tell your dad and it wouldn’t come out. It’s like… it’s like my mouth stops.”

I stared at my girlfriend across the living room. She was at the counter making tea like this was any other night, humming softly to herself.

I couldn’t answer my mom.

I told her I’d call her back and hung up.

I walked into the kitchen and said, “Stop.”

My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

My girlfriend turned, holding a mug with both hands, steam curling up past her face.

“I’m not doing anything,” she said.

“Then what is,” I asked, and my voice cracked on the last word.

She set the mug down carefully, like she didn’t want it to clink too loud.

“Your promise,” she said.

She said it like it wasn’t an argument. Like she was telling me what time it was.

The next morning I tried to leave.

Not dramatic. Not an argument. Just a quiet escape before my brain could rationalize it.

I packed a bag while she was in the shower. I moved as fast as I could, like speed mattered. Like the house itself might notice.

I wrote a note to myself on the kitchen table in thick marker.

GET OUT.

THE PROMISE IS DOING THIS.

I stood there for a second, staring at the words, trying to burn them into my head.

Then I went to grab my keys from the counter.

When I turned back, the note was blank.

Not torn up. Not flipped over.

Blank, like the ink had been sucked clean off the paper.

I picked it up and held it under the light. The paper was warm from my hand. There was no smear, no residue. Just white.

My bag slipped out of my fingers and hit the floor.

She came out of the bathroom a minute later, hair wrapped in a towel, face calm.

She stopped in the doorway and looked at the bag, then at me.

There was no anger. No panic. Just patience.

Like she’d been waiting for me to try.

She stepped closer, her footsteps quiet on the tile.

“Say it,” she whispered.

I opened my mouth.

Nothing.

She nodded, small and satisfied.

“Okay,” she said.

And then, like the conversation was over, she reached for my hand.

I took it.

I don’t know why. I hate that I took it.

Weeks went by.

I stopped calling people by name because it felt wrong coming out of my mouth. My mom’s name came out flat, like I was reading it off an envelope. My brother’s sounded borrowed.

Even my own name felt like something I used to answer to.

But when I looked at her, the feeling was still there. The familiarity. The warmth. The ache in my chest when she walked into a room.

Like she didn’t need a name because she was already inside the part of me that uses names.

She’s here now, as I write this.

She’s in the kitchen humming, moving like she owns the space. Every so often she stops, like she’s listening for something.

Sometimes at night she curls against me and whispers into my neck, “Do you still love me.”

Many people seem to be stressed out, tired of their job, tired of the rat race and they can't wait to be done.

I know, for myself, I really don't mind my job at all. I feel no sadness when Monday comes around and I need to sign in and work, I like my coworkers, have a good boss, get paid pretty well and I feel pretty secure in my role.

I won't be able to retire until my mid 60s (bad divorce around 40 that delayed everything). I know I may feel different when I'm in my 60s and just...tired, but for now, I really don't mind my work. 

Sure, it would be nice to have enough money to just quit and do whatever I want, work part time at my favorite book store for fun, meet up with some other old people for coffee every morning, walk the dogs, take naps, go to bed early. I can see the appeal of that.

Anyone else fairly content working and not stressed about it? Anyone who retired who decided to get a fun part time job or donate a lot of time to an important non-profit?

Edit: I guess I should note I mostly WFH, as that makes a huge difference. I also spent my 30s travelling the world and having fun, so I'm not waiting for some retirement to go and do all the things I put on hold.

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

He has openly stated he finds church and religious musings boring. He does not have many thoughts about the afterlife (he believes that dying is like sleeping and it's just is what it is-- no musings about what we might turn into, etc) and I've never pictured myself being with someone who has absolutely zero spiritual inclination and yet--- he is my longest and healthiest relationship ever. I just struggle with the idea of always having to go to church alone and also that when he goes--- he feels absolutely nothing for himself. He goes because it's for me and he likes the free food at coffee hour -- he doesn't ""feel,"" anything and church is simply ""boring."" 

  
Prior to us meeting I was single for about 10 years and one night I was venting to the universe via journaling and I heard a voice say ""Something is coming soon."" I said I want the next thing to be the real deal. And sure enough, about two months later we connected.



I'm struggling with how the universe matched us together when to me that appears to be a big part. I don't need someone with the same discipline as me but being with someone who isn't spiritual at all can be lonely at times. I've told him before I've heard God's voice before and have had strong intuition but he doesn't get how it could be something divine-- his first reaction is that it's not ""supernatural,"" which is not what I was going for at all. Ugh. Just wondering if anyone else has struggled with this and how much of an issue is this later on? For me I don't want to feel stunted in my own spiritual growth and it would be nice if he did believe in some type of God or felt connected some way spiritually it's like a topic I can't really go to with him because he genuinely doesn't have much of a concept of that stuff.",3,1770656198.0,SpiritualAwakening,4,1.0,False

I’m looking for input so that I can budget for my first base station set up.,"My wife and I are sitting for our exams next month. My wife is shooting for Technician and General. I’ll be doing all three. I’m totally new to the hobby and know almost nothing. I haven’t got involved with the local club yet although, I’m going to try and make the coffee meet up this week. As I find many aspects of the hobby fascinating I have no idea what parts of it I’ll really gravitate towards until I try them out. In preparation for getting licensed, I’m putting together a budget to get some hardware set up at the house. I don’t mind spending a few bucks but I’m looking for suggestions on WHAT to budget for. The radio is pretty far down my list of stuff to buy at this point so we can skip that. I’m primarily looking for suggestions on an antenna set up and associated hardware. I have ten acres with a high ridge running geographically N/S (just sagebrush) and no HOA. I know this is kind of “it all depends on what you want to do” sort of question but, even with a lot of caveats, I’m sure whatever you have to offer will help me. Thank you all!

### 🐾 “Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before Training My First Dog” — A Few Hard Truths That Changed Everything 🐶💭

I still remember the first time I realized my dog wasn’t being *bad* — he was just **confused**.  
He pulled on the leash, ignored commands, got anxious over small things.  
I was frustrated. He was overwhelmed.  

And the hardest part?  
I eventually saw that the real problem wasn’t my dog… it was **me**.  

---

At that moment, something shifted.  
Training stopped being about “obedience” and started being about **communication**.  
Dogs don’t misbehave to push your buttons — they react to what we **teach** (or fail to teach) them.  

Here are the lessons I *wish someone had shared with me* before I started:

• **Clarity matters more than control.** Most bad behavior stems from unclear signals, not stubborn dogs.  
• **Short, consistent sessions win every time.** Ten minutes daily beats one marathon session a week.  
• **Energy is everything.** A calm human creates a confident dog.  
• **Reactivity often means fear, not attitude.** Punishment teaches silence, not understanding.  

I learned to stop shouting and start *listening* — and that changed everything about my relationship with my dog.

If you’re struggling with your dog pulling, jumping, or ignoring you, here’s something that genuinely helped me (and countless new owners I’ve met since):  
👉 [Check out this free dog training course + giveaway](https://cashflowmanifest.com/dogtrainner)

It’s built for real people — the kind who have jobs, messy homes, and dogs that don’t listen right away.  
It goes through how to get obedience without shouting, how to stop unwanted habits, and how to build the kind of trust that makes your dog *want* to listen.  

Don’t wait until frustration turns to guilt — bad habits bake in fast.

I’m sharing this here because Reddit loves honesty over hype — and this is honestly one of the few things that made me feel confident again as a dog owner.  
If this helps even one dog feel safer and one human feel calmer, it’s worth it.  

⏳ Don’t save it for “later.” Do it while your pup still believes you're figuring it out *together.*

**Flair Suggestions (for r/Trendinfo or other dog subs):**  
🐕 Discussion | Advice | Storytime  

**Best Time to Post:**  
👉 Morning hours on weekdays (7–10 AM EST), or early weekend mornings — when most owners scroll with coffee and dogs at their side.  

**Formatting Tip:**  
• Keep paragraphs short and conversational (remember, Reddit hates giant walls of text).  
• Make it feel like a story first, advice second, link last.  

**Hashtags (optional if your subreddit allows them):**

1r09ddm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r09ddm,"Haul check-in: socks ghosted me, but the rest? Mostly fire.","Bought a stack last week. Some pieces earned closet real estate. One made me question my life choices. Zero corporate speak:

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

Wallet’s lighter, closet’s happier. And yeah—I’m still side-eyeing those socks like they ghosted me after one date",3,1770655785.0,FrenchyReps,1,1.0,False
1r09d5j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r09d5j,Crazy shopping orders. My first ever quadruple stack!,"At least in my area/market (Houston), the most I see are double stacks, either shopping + food or food + food deliveries. I have never ever seen a triple stack before, let alone a quadruple (x4) stack. And it was all shopping orders!!

Last night during the super bowl I received my first ever triple stack for 99 Ranch (1 item) + Target + Petco pickup for $31. Then literally 1 min later I received an add-on for another Target order for $14 and just 2 miles additional. Obviously I accepted.

The 99 ranch literally took 3 mins (some dumplings) and Target about 20 mins. Was just a bunch of candy, chips, and soda.

Everything took about 1hr and 30mins from start to finish. My scheduled shift was done and I wanted to go home to catch the game so I did dash along the way back to my zone and got a Chinese order for literally a house in my neighborhood. Basically free money.

All in all, really good night. It's a shame that the one Target order got bundled with all the good tippers. ",10,1770655773.0,doordash_drivers,5,1.0,False
