1gidcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gidcvv/disappointed_by_the_lack_of_care_in_the_kenway/,Disappointed by the Lack of Care in the Kenway Mansion Memory in AC Syndicate,"Let me start by saying I’m an old-school Assassin’s Creed fan. I’m finally on my first run of the newer games, starting with Syndicate. To say I’m disappointed in the way they handled the Kenway mansion in this game is an understatement.

The whole purpose of this memory sequence, as I understand it, is nostalgia—right? A callback to Black Flag, a game we AC veterans hold close to our hearts. I was really hoping this memory would be a fitting tribute, something to make us old-timers shed a tear or two for the Kenways.

Honestly, Syndicate surprised me up to this point—I was enjoying it. But when I got to the Kenway mansion memory, I couldn’t believe how shallow and careless it felt. THE SAME GENERIC PAINTING appears at least twenty times, random portraits of nobodies are plastered everywhere, and the level design feels like any other building in the game. But this isn’t any other building. This is the Kenway mansion.

Would it really have been so hard to add portraits of Edward, Tessa, Haytham, or Jenny? Just a few details to honor the legacy and help us feel the weight of this place in AC lore? And before anyone says, “Well, maybe the building changed ownership”—sure, maybe, but that’s no excuse here. This memory is about the nostalgia trip. If they’d invested a bit of thought, it would’ve made such an emotional impact. Instead, it’s just… frustrating.

And don’t even get me started on the “memorabilia” we’re supposed to find. Edward’s hat casually lying on a coffee table? It feels careless and cheap. It could have been so easy to hit all the right notes here, but they chose the quick route instead, and the result is an experience that’s hollow, almost disrespectful to the Kenways, the manor in particular, and their importance to AC lore.

Syndicate had a real chance to bring the past alive here, but instead, I’m left more angry than nostalgic. Anyone else feel this way?",1,1730602180.0,assassinscreed,0,1.0,False
1gidcd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1gidcd1/i_heard_that_ms_is_gonna_stop_supporting_win_10/,i heard that MS is gonna stop supporting Win 10 & older,"When i saw a news report stating that Microsoft is gonna stop  supporting Window 10 and older within a year and i discovered that my computer isn't compatible with 11, i knew i had to get a new one.

* New build or upgrade?

I want a whole new computer anyway, this one is kinda old and ive already had to replace the motherboard because someone spilled coffee on it and upgrade the hard drive to solid state because it was too slow, but even those are a while back.

* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

My wireless rechargeable mouse, it works via bluetooth, USB-c port, or USB-A port, so as long as i have at least one of those i should be okay. And My headphones, currently I am working on finding some decent affordable bluetooth headphones because i like to walk around with headphones in and the chords tend to catch on everything, because I'm a klutz, but for now all i have is ones with the standard size headphone jack.

* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)

Sims 4, Toontown Rewritten, Big Fish Games, and streaming Netflix, Hulu, etc.

* Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

Northern California, on a mountain just north of San Francisco.

* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

need a laptop, I don't have room for a desktop, (idk what you mean by number, 15""-17"" would be good, HD or UHD prefered, again hu? i understand what that is, but idk whats considered slow or fast, but i want faster). i tend to walk in the room and things just start working, i never had to make an effort to figure out what the vocab and specs. were. is that cuz im a millennial?

* Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

I'm mainly trying to figure out how much i should save, but hoping i can keep it under $400, but idk if that's even possible, so I'm just trying to find out.

* WiFi or wired connection?

WiFi, idk if our router does wired, but i do know i don't want to be chained to my moms dresser if it does.

* Size/noise constraints?

quieter the better, I'm not the only one without my own room and i can keep some pretty weird hours when I have a hard time sleeping. Outside of it needing to be a laptop for space reasons, no restriction on size.

* Color/lighting preferences?

i prefer to have a standard (not backlit) keyboard unless someone knows how to make it easier to read what keys are there with the light off, it helps read them at night with it on, but i need to use a book light anyway, cuz i do a lot of notes for games on flash cards. as for color, not pink, i hate pink, im a girl, im just fine with being a girl, but i hate pink.

* Any other specific needs?

Win 11, lots of USB ports, and high RAM and SSD. i know im trying to get filet mignon on a round steak budget, but apparently if you cut the middle of a tenderloin out, the middle is your filet. Soooo, maybe a little creativity could make this work too? ",1,1730602128.0,buildapcforme,1,1.0,False

I had a table of two, asked what they would like to drink, came back with their coffees and then asked if they’d like a couple of minutes to decide. Routine stuff. I thought it was a middle aged man and his elderly mom.

I started taking their order and she ordered blueberry pancakes, then paused for a second while looking at the menu. She then ordered two pieces of French toast. I take a lot of breakfast orders and this was strange, I looked up from my notepad and noticed that half of her face was sagging down. I looked to the man that was with her and he was looking at his menu so I got his attention, he asked if they could have a minute.

I knew something was wrong and kind of lingered outside of where they were (we have ONE table in separate room that luckily they were at) and eventually the man poked his head out and said we needed an ambulance.

My manager was right there so I told her, she ran to the phone and was talking to dispatch. I kept an eye on her tables while this was happening but felt awful about it, I just wanted to be there for this older lady. 

Turns out she was not his mom but his wife, she was only 67 but looked much older. She has cancer and has been going through treatment for years. 

I held the doors open for the EMTs and they got there very quickly. Being in the separate room they at least had some privacy. 

They emailed the restaurant today and she is doing okay, next time they come in breakfast is on us. 

I’m so happy that she is doing okay but it was a really rough day for me. I spent most of the day crying out back between helping other guests. 

I guess I’m just hoping that I’m not selfish for being affected by this. I think that I was calm in the moment and handled it as best that I could, but I was just so scared. ",1,1730601974.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

They have different expectations and different perspectives on the technical problem solving and scale.

The why behind the question - in search of a star technical co-founder for an idea we have been working on and it can use a strong technical backbone. Open to Ideas & Passionate Tech Innovators!

Throwing this out there to see if there’s anyone who might be interested in building something from the ground up. I’ve been working on an idea that I think has real potential, and I’m looking to connect with someone who’s not only skilled technically but genuinely excited by big-picture thinking and the startup journey.

So here’s the deal: I’m in the early stages of a project that could use a strong technical backbone. The concept involves [mobile applications coupled with AI technologies, e.g., AI, machine learning, blockchain, etc.], and it’s aimed at tackling a huge society problem. The scale is really massive. I don’t want to dive into every detail here. Happy to chat live. If you are located in USA, that would be superb.

What I’m really looking for is someone who feels driven by tech problems worth solving. Are there any fields you’re super excited about right now? Do you love the idea of building a product from scratch? Or maybe you’ve got a side project that aligns with some of this – either way, I’m all ears.

If you’re wondering about the kind of partnership I’m after, here’s the gist: a team where each co-founder is empowered and can lean into their strengths. I’d love to know what you value in a co-founder and what kind of work culture you thrive in. Whether you’re into autonomy or like a more collaborative flow, I’m flexible but also value open communication and a strong vision.

For my part, I’m all about transparency and keeping things real. I’m committed to contributing my own expertise in [Strategy, Building products, scale, Customer Centricity and mass scale adoption], but I really want to build this vision collaboratively, especially with the tech direction you’d bring in. If you’re the type who loves a good challenge, or if you get excited about projects that could actually make a difference, let’s talk!

Let me know if this resonates or if you’re even slightly curious – I’d be happy to grab a virtual coffee or just message back and forth to see if there’s a fit.",1,1730601937.0,startups,0,1.0,False

He admitted to me that he had been seeing her every few weeks for a year, no sex, no kissing, just dinners, coffees, helping her move etc and texting.

He admitted recently to all of this but is begging me to give him a second chance saying that he realised he loves me so much and I am the person he want's to spend the rest of his life with. He said he felt a duty to her / was afraid of her reaction if he ended it.

He said he's cut her off completely, wants to do couples therapy, told all his friends and family what he did, wants to do anything he can to build the trust he severely broke with me. Offered to show me his phone every time he gets a message, tell me where he is at all times and devote himself to me completely.

1gid6mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gid6mg/my_husband_was_falsely_arrested_on_dv_what_now/,My husband was falsely arrested on DV - what now? Ohio,"My husband (26M) and I (25f) got into a loud argument.  

No actual violence took place outside of me, throwing an object at a wall, not at him. I totally understand that it was not okay of me to have done, but I was very emotional at the time as the fight was centered around infidelity. 

My mother, a DV survivor, heard yelling and a loud noise and called the police. 

He went to bed, I went to grab a drink, and my mother let the police into my home. 

I told them point blank, he didn't touch me, my mother is a wheelchair user and felt vulnerable because we were upstairs and she couldn't see me. 

I declined to make a report, and the officer in my kitchen shined a bright light in my eyes and questioned my haggard appearance, I simply repeated I didn't wish to speak to them, my husband didn't touch me and I would like them to leave my house. When he said I needed to explain the crying or he was arresting my husband.
I briefly explained what happened and again asked them to leave. 

They woke my husband up forcefully and while already cuffing him and asked if we'd been fighting. He half asleep said ""yes we had,"" which isn't dishonest, but it wasn't physical. 

He sat in a cell for over 24 hours, and a DV advocate advised me not to attend his pretrial and that he would need an attorney later in the proceedings.  

Fortunately, I did get legal counsel for him and showed up, fully unscathed, and requested no protection order. They didn't place one, and he was released. I was informed after the fact that if I hadn't shown up there, there would have been a default, no contact order. 

His job is threatening to fire him due to the nature of the charge, and the only confession the police have is a groggy ""I dont fucking remember but we were fighting"" as they slammed him face first into a wall after he'd been awake for 26 hours straight. 

I even confessed after the distress of seeing him cuffed that I was the only one that did anything physical, but they told me it civil as they took him. 

What do I do? The more I insist he didn't hit me, the worse they seem to treat him. I told the DA he didn't touch me, and I'm given a DV hotline card. 

I told the advocate he didn't touch me, and I was told sure he didn't and offered coffee. 

How is ""I dknt remember, we were fighting"" a solid confession to proceed to trial with if I'm fully unscathed, and in my own words telling them he didn't touch me?!?! Hell, he wasn't even the one yelling that was me. 

My husband is 6'1, 230 lbs, and in the security field - I'm 5'4, 140 lbs. If he'd touched me, I'd have marks, but nobody is listening.  

I'm angrier than a hen in a KFC over him talking to other women, but that doesn't mean he deserves his life to be ruined. I feel like shit, I may have ruined his life over some texts, but I don't even think his lawyer believes me.

Obviously, everyone who knows things knows that these are completely disreputable and designed to fail.

Forward.

Forward.

Wait three minutes, then hit eject.

It's good pay for what I do, which is sit and press buttons. I have a screen showing me a bird's-eye view of the machines, but I don't see the process.

Unless there's an emergency, I don't see anything.

It's so *loud*, especially during processing.

It's always that same tune, *When you wish upon a star*, on repeat. 

I had a headache, so after pressing the usual buttons (forward, forward, forward, left, forward), I reached for my coffee, taking a scorching sip—

Spilling it all over myself, and the control panel.

“Fuck!”

I grabbed a napkin; my gaze glued to the panel which was toast. Right in the middle of processing product#127890. 

I was about to stab the emergency button under my desk when the music… stopped. That constant tune bleeding into my brain came to an abrupt halt, and something else cut through the uneasy silence. Initially, I thought it was a machine acting up—but no. 

Something ice-cold wriggled down my spine. 

*Screams.* 

I could hear agonizing screams. When the locked screen flashed up, I found myself staring inside Unit 56. 

All I could see was red dripping from the walls, the ceiling, spinning blades slowly descending from every angle, needles and saws inches from a guy. 

Early twenties. I could see where the work had begun on his face, peeling a chunk of flesh from his cheekbones. 

He stood with his arms by his sides, unblinking, and after I stabbed a button with an eye symbol, he jerked suddenly, blinking rapidly, waking up.

His face was *inches* from a frozen saw. 

The boy'a lips parted, a guttural cry rattling my skull. 

“Help me,” he whispered, straining against metal arms restraining him.

“I'm… I’m going to,” I choked. “Calm down. What's your name?”

The boy broke down, and I noticed, my gut twisting, I could see his skull. 

“Sam.” he whispered. “I want to go… home.”

I couldn't respond. 

“Why can't I feel anything?” Sam sobbed. 

“Eleanor?” My manager's voice crackled through my talkie. “If there's a problem, press the overload button.”

I couldn't move.

Couldn't breathe.

“Eleanor?” My manager repeated. “All right, I'll do it from my end.”

No. 

I dived forward. 

I don't remember shrieking or moving. 

I just stood there, watching the machine continue, mercilessly slicing through Sam, splitting his bones apart, and stuffing his remnants, including his brain, into a shiny new Flynn Ryder costume. 

His lips spread into a grin. 

*“J-just can't-get my n-n-nose right!”*

“Eject the product, Eleanor.”

I did, vomit staining my hands.

The brand new Flynn Ryder mascot walked out.

And a girl walked in.

The screen flashed white.

Our relationship has been somewhat solid for the most part. He is a loving, supportive person and is big on acts of service as a love language (he makes me coffee, will massage me, etc). I feel loved by him constantly.

However, one of the biggest issues in our relationship is his lack of communication. Little things and big things. It’s hard to get details out of him when I ask how his day was, he doesn’t really express his feelings when I’ve done something that upsets him, etc. I’ve brought this up and explained that it makes me feel disconnected from him because I feel like he’s never really open to me. He says it’s because there’s nothing really big that happened or if I do something wrong, it’s not worth making a big deal out of him. We’ve talked about this plenty of times and he explains that because of the way he was raised, he’s not used to speaking up and would rather just go with the flow. We’ve talked about how the way he was raised wasn’t healthy and we tried to work on it together on our own but it wasn’t working. He began developing anxiety as he was forced to face things he has always ignored and  because of this, he decided to begin therapy and I’m honestly very proud of him for it. 

For the most part, the therapy helped much more than us trying on our own. His anxiety lessened over time and it seemed we were making progress. The issue is that I feel like we keep going in the same circle where it’ll be great and then I’m shut out or he won’t communicate and it feels like we are back at square one. 

I know he is working hard in therapy and I know he loves me and that’s ultimately why he’s doing this. But I think he forgets that I’m putting in almost as much work as he is. It takes a lot of mental strength to be supportive 24/7 and be the cheerleader when he can’t be. Especially when we hit another bump and I feel hurt and trying to push past it to keep going. 

A few days ago on Halloween, my phone was dying while at his family’s home,  so he went to go charge it for me and gave me his phone to use in the meantime. I 100% trust him and cheating has never been something I was scared of. His Instagram is really boring and full of sports things, so I went into his messages because I am a chismosa. I didn’t really think I’d see anything because it’s usually him texting me or his siblings or work things. I found a text thread with “Maybe: Sofia (fake name)” (the way iPhones do it when it’s guessing who the contact is). I didn’t read much, because I was in shock, but scrolled up enough to realize it wasn’t a few texts messages. They had shared music and shared jokes and stuff like that. I really was in shock because I didn’t know what to make of it. He came into the room and I told him that I was trying to remain calm and asked him who Sofia was. He said it was an old coworker friend from years ago and said it wasn’t anything untoward. I asked him why I didn’t know about her since it wasn’t anything bad and he said he didn’t know why he didn’t tell me, he just didn’t. But that it something from therapy his therapist suggested when they were discussing his problems with non-romantic interpersonal relationships. He has told me about it briefly and said his therapist had suggested working on it by reaching out to a friend he hadn’t spoken with in a long time and had let the friendship die. He never mentioned anything about it after that so I didn’t know he had started on it by doing this. 

I do believe him when he says that it wasn’t anything inappropriate because in the brief texts I saw I didn’t see anything weird like heart emojis or anything. But I am still hurt that he didn’t say anything. I had seen some texts where they were talking about me, but not too many details as I didn’t really read through anything for too long as I scrolled up. 

What really hurts is that there was this whole person he is speaking to that I know nothing about, even when they spoke about me and he didn’t think to mention it to me at all. I’d ask him for updates on whatever he wanted to share with me from his therapy sessions and he didn’t have anything like this to say. I feel like I am putting in work and I’m not getting the same work put in from him. I’m hurt that this person is getting music recommendations and whole ass conversations while I’m trying to beg for any details sometimes. 

If he had mentioned that he was going to do this, I’d like to think that I would have supported and encouraged this and would not have a problem with it. But now I’m just confused and hurt and can’t help but see it as a betrayal even while I can acknowledge that he is working on something I told him I had a problem with (his communication).

TLDR: I'm wondering how people get quality rest during the daytime when they're ""wired but tired.""

Longer Version:

During a crash, I'm utterly exhausted, but I have trouble falling asleep (at night and during the daytime) because my body cranks out adrenaline. I seem to be stuck in that ""tired but wired"" state. 

I have tried meditation, calming music, reading, aromatherapy, Holy Basil, chamomile, audiobooks, therapy, cuddling with my dog, and other things... but it's really hard to get rid of the tension and hyper-arousal. 

Anxiety may be partly to blame (I'm worried about my illness getting worse). And I'm also guilty of having an ""overactive mind."" I seem to crave stimulation (even when I'm exhausted).

ADHD medications can calm down my mind, but they also make it harder to sleep at night (just like coffee).  I would like to spend less time looking at screens, but it's hard when you're stuck in bed and bored. 

Either way, this cycle of ""exertion->crash->adrenaline->inability to sleep"" is driving me crazy. How do you calm down your body so you can fall asleep during crashes? ",4,1730600469.0,cfs,2,1.0,False

Had unprotected sex 6 months ago. The only symptom that i have right after that was urge to pee. Just in case, i made a hiv/syphilis test that went negative and went to an urologist. He told me that since there was no discharge of any type i did not have to worry about it and it was too soon to check for any STD. That most likely was stress. It disappeared 1 week after, so kind that i forgot about it.

Now, this urge to pee came back like 2 weeks ago. The weird thing is that it came back right after i shave my anus which i dont know if its a coincidence or has to do with it.

I felt really stressed this couple of weeks bc of it. Read online that the urge to pee could be prostate inflamation so i quit cigarettes , coffee, and masturbation (im addicted to porn so i beat my meat very often) This last 3 days the urge to pee went way better but a new symptom appeared. I feel incredibly tired from all my body. Like if im about to get sick or something. Is this bc of stress or has to do with STD symptoms?

Oh and i made the Vih/sifilis test again and went negative.

In 2 days i have an appointment with a new urologist.

I of course said Yes I’d be happy to. Days later I meet up with her to grab coffee whenever I walk in I’m wearing casual clothes and she seems to be wearing a Sunday School/Church type of dress (already a bad start) we sat down and the first thing she asked me about was my faith (Both of us are Christian) I was kinda shocked by the answer cause I’ve never been with a girl before who’s ever asked that question until way later on so I skim through my religious views real fast and she tells me hers. Looking back I think that was a trick question to see if she wanted to pursue me and I failed (even though we have the same viewpoints, I just didn’t know what to exactly say at the time) After that though it went great and I got her to laugh and we talked about a bunch of different hobbies/interests. After we leave I get a text a few days later saying “Hey I really enjoyed our time together but I don’t want to pursue this as a relationship although I hope we can still be friends” I feel like cause of me rushing it and understanding the coffee “hangout” wrong I screwed up big time on my end. Thankfully it’s been a few weeks and she’s still going up to talk to me and I’ve been hanging out with her in a group setting the past few weeks. I’m thinking about giving it another month just to give us both enough time and then going up and apologizing for rushing things last time and asking her if she would like to get to know each other (as friends first) and going from there and if she doesn’t want to then I’ll let her know that’s totally fine and something I’m completely comfortable with. What do you all think? Is this the best option?

The trip started everything was going so well till i started having nausea and diarrhea then everything went nuts i was nuts felt like i was in a loop in that washroom trying to do my stuff, then i went back in bed with my friends and his gf and we started talking even tho before i was alone on the bed in the living room and listening to pink floyd it was so good but when i went there and she said like (the gf of my friend) im ur mother or some love stuff like you should love everyone. 
Then i started talking abt my ex situationship who i really had bad time to move on from then everything went even worst and went to the washroom again then barely remember anything, i was jumping off apparently trying to go outside pee everywhere and throwing up in washroom till both of my friends saw me naked and i didn’t know that was actually all real.
Till i actually managed to go outside then the gf of my friend came to me and when she holded my hand to come back i literally grabbed her after i thought she was my ex situationship (i already deeply apologize to her and she understood it as the trip sitter) then the worst part my mom called to get some coffee since the store i work in has a coffee shop and i answered her saying everything (she forgot that i told her im not gonna be home).
Then it even got worst where when she heard my voice she started screaming and asking me where i am till my friends gf took the phone and told her everything then it even got worst where my mom is really a religious person and she doesn’t even know that mushrooms can be psychedelics she thought i was on some drugs or idk and she is really strict abt it like would kick me out so i got even more stressed out and when she came she brought my old coworker with her cz he finished his shift and i was in a such miserable state that i barely recognized him and i thought everything was a dream so i could just do wtv i want but i was in a dream where i will stay there for ever and thought abt death multiple time and just giving up on my body in my friends house.
When i came home my sister helped me and then i started talking abt my situationship and how she left me this and that… and started apologizing to her if i did something bad to her and then my mom came and started talking and i was confessing to her that i did that multiple times and im so sorry and asking her to don’t kick me out and that im always doing my best at school for her…
But i couldn’t sleep bcz they took my phone since i was calling random people but i even got even more worried where i wanted to check to my friend and if everything what happened is real or no. Anyway my mom concluded that i need some therapy help since i told her that psychedelics help with post traumatic events and help you feel better which helped me before but that one idk why it was so different. Now i feel so bad for everyone i tried my best to apologize but i dont think i will ever trip with anyone else since that was my first time doing it with people.
 I just wanted to share this story hope i get some honest opinions thanks.

Since then I only had surface level relationships and nothing deep, people that come and go, people who exclude me from plans, people who always treat me as a backup friend and last to remember.

Its very lonely ! Specially during the weekends when all my siblings out with friends but I'm with no one to ask to hang out. I've been fighting this loneliness for so long but it eating up my soul,,,,I do my best to entertain myself and take myself to coffee dates etc but my heart still breaks when I see others with friends that I don't have.

In search of a genuine connection, so let me share a little bit about myself! I’m 33 years of age, an Aries, from the wonderful Southern California. I work in banking for one of America’s top banks, and have been in the industry for close to 9 years. I’m 5’9”, divorced with zero kids, Hispanic, with a pierced nose and one arm and one leg full of tattoos. In my free time I enjoy resting; nap anyone? I like trying new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, bars, you name it, I love to try it! I enjoy traveling, mostly to city centers or countrysides, not so much beaches. I don’t play many video games or watch anime at all, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to it. I like trivia nights, sporting events, farmers markets, plant stores and antiques.

I guess what I’m looking for is a partner. Someone I can connect with, someone I can have fun with, someone to be lazy with, someone to travel with. Looking for some to make laugh and to make me laugh. I guess someone to do anything and everything with. Not really sold on one relationship type, so I am open for discussion!

Maybe you’re out there in the world, and maybe I’m the one you’re looking for, or maybe I’m not but let’s chat like we’ve been friends for ten years and see where it goes. No pressure, no expectations, just two people connecting. Or maybe you want to be flirty and make out! I’m down for anything.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1gicfts,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gicfts/my_approach_to_the_dating_world_as_a_divorced/,My Approach to the Dating World as a Divorced 31-Year-Male,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 31M, recently back in the dating world after a long-term marriage and relationship. It’s been about a decade since I last dated, and this time, I’m trying a different approach. Instead of using dating apps or actively seeking a partner, I’m focusing on doing things I genuinely enjoy—like yoga, beach bonfires, and spiritual events—and letting connections happen naturally. I hope to meet someone who shares my values and passions, and I’m prioritizing deep, meaningful relationships over casual flings.

I’m not seeking emotionless sex either. I believe sex is sacred—a profound spiritual and energetic exchange. It’s something I only want to share in the context of a real connection.

I’ve met a few amazing women this way, but one in particular stands out: Ava. I discovered Ava on Meetup, where she was hosting her first free yoga class at a local park. Her profile picture caught my eye—she had this peaceful, centered vibe—and it inspired me to attend. Sure, her appearance was a factor, but yoga is something I’m pursuing for myself, to follow my passions. If I meet someone I click with, like Ava, it’s a bonus.

In person, Ava is stunning and radiates an energy I truly admire. At that first class, her dad was there for support, which I found sweet and refreshing. I value family connections like that. Out of respect, I didn’t try to hit on her. Instead, I kept things friendly.

Later, in a twist of synchronicity, I ran into Ava and her family at a coffee shop. They invited me to join them, and we ended up chatting for nearly two hours. The conversation flowed effortlessly—we discussed yoga, art, spirituality, and more. As we vibed over our shared interests, I casually asked if she’d ever been to a sound bath and invited her to one. We texted briefly about it, and she said, “Yeah, that sounds great!” but also added, “I’ll let you know.” Unfortunately, she ghosted me and didn’t follow up.

My Approach and Boundaries:
One of my new boundaries in dating is not to chase someone who doesn’t put in effort. If someone isn’t interested enough to follow up or suggest an alternative plan, I take it as a sign to move on. I assume she’s just not that into me, we’re not a good match, or maybe she’s not looking for anything serious or isn’t over an ex. I want a relationship that feels balanced and mutual. I want a girl who’s genuinely excited about me. If she doesn’t feel that way, that’s fine. 

That said, I decided to attend Ava’s yoga class again. By chance, it was just the two of us, since it’s a new offering and word probably hasn’t gotten around yet. I was actually glad I went because I could tell she was happy I showed up. She’s passionate about this community yoga thing, and she would have been disappointed if no one had come. We had an incredible conversation afterward. I asked thoughtful questions like what inspired her career change and whether her younger self would be surprised by who she is today. She seemed to really enjoy being asked meaningful questions and being heard, talking for long stretches, and I could tell she appreciated the conversation.

Now, I’m debating whether to text her something like, “Hey, I enjoyed our conversation today. I’ll see you next week.” I also know a restaurant that caters to her dietary preferences, and I’m tempted to invite her, but I’m hesitant. I don’t want to come off as overly eager since she didn’t show much interest last time. At the same time, I don’t want to just go to yoga and risk getting friend-zoned because I’m being nice without showing romantic interest.

My Questions for the Community:

	1.	Does my approach make sense? Is it fair to wait for her to show more interest, or should I make another move?
	2.	Women, what kind of things make you think about a guy after a great conversation? Is it confidence, active listening, subtle flirting, or something else?
	3.	How do you balance showing enough interest without coming across as desperate? I’m not desperate by the way and if this doesn’t work out I’m not bothered. 

Dating has definitely changed a lot since I was last single. It’s also different dating in your 30s compared to your 20s, haha. I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice. Thanks for reading!",4,1730599156.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Always the best friend…,"Do you ever feel like you are the best friend to everyone, but no one ever reciprocates that energy? My whole life, with friends and even close family, I have been the one that everyone confides in, I throw showers, I am the gift giver for every occasion, yet no one (other than my husband) returns that same enthusiasm. No one calls to check on me, no one wants to hang out for coffee or lunch unless I plan it.  Currently I am dealing with a chronic health condition, autoimmune, and I don’t have the mental or physical energy to be a friend to anyone or invest in anything where there is no return on that investment. 
My ‘best friend’ for the past 10 years recently moved into a new house. She’s lived there for probably 2 years now, and I have never been invited over. She claims that it’s always too messy or there’s unfinished remodeling and she’s embarrassed, but she has invited other friends over, and she has family over nearly every day. We don’t talk unless I call or text. I know she struggles with mental health, and I’m usually very understanding of that. 
I’m writing all of this because she got pregnant with her fourth baby earlier this year, after having a miscarriage. With my last two babies, she was the first to know I was pregnant, and the first to know I was in labor. She was also the first person at my house to hold the babies. With her baby, I was the last one she told, she told her family and sisters first. She went into labor today, and I didn’t even know until after she had the baby. Her sisters were there the whole time, whom she’s not even close to. She has always had a very strained relationship with them, until pretty recently. And honestly, I am so happy that she is closer to them and they have worked a lot of things out.  She invited me to come see the baby, and I get there and it’s a houseful of family. I was there probably two hours and the baby was passed around, but not to me. I didn’t want to be intrusive and ask to hold the baby, I just wanted to be there for my friend. So I did whatever I could to be helpful. But there really wasn’t anything left to do, so I just kind of sat to the side. I didn’t mean to be a brat, because it’s not about me, but I have to admit I was hurt. I finally left after a few hours, and my friend asked why I was leaving because I hadn’t gotten a chance to hold the baby yet. I just told her I loved her, her baby was beautiful, and I would hold the baby another time. 
I’m just tired. My health is like a cloud over everything in my life right now, but I have nothing left to give. Am I overreacting? Where do I go from here? It’s ultimately her choice who she wanted at her birth, and I respect that. I think my expectations are too high for people and relationships.

I truly believe that decluttering the home helps clear the mind too, so I was eager to dive into it. As soon as I got up, I went straight to my room and started gathering clothes for donation. What started as a small task turned into a two-hour journey of sorting and memories. By the end of it, I had four full bags of clothes ready to be given to someone who might need them more than I do. It felt like shedding layers of the past.

Next, I looked around for other unused items and managed to fill another bag of things to throw away—old, forgotten, but now finally moving on. When I checked the time, it was already 10. Perfect timing for a well-deserved break. I headed to Starbucks, laptop in tow, craving that comforting first sip of coffee.

I’ve also started a new tradition of daily reading and today was day one. I picked up a book by Robin Sharma. (I’ll share a synopsis in another post—stay tuned!) As I sipped my coffee, I began my editing work. Editing videos has become a hobby that brings me joy—capturing little memories, adding the right touch, and seeing it come together. This time, I was working on a potluck video, piecing together moments and laughter. There’s still more to do, but it’s shaping up well.

Once I finished my coffee, I went back home, ready to take the donation bags out. Dropping them off felt amazing, like I was not only lightening my space but maybe brightening someone else’s day too.

With that done, I returned to my room to tackle another round of decluttering—this time, my old emails. Who knew digital clutter could feel so heavy? As I scrolled, deleting, and organizing, I found a bag’s worth of unread messages I never even noticed. But here’s the gem: I discovered two checks from Costco I didn’t even remember I had! Proof that decluttering holds hidden treasures.

Hunger hit me like a wave after all that work. I made some omelets and toast, the simple kind that always tastes the best when you’re starving. I devoured everything, maybe a little too much, and before I knew it, I fell into a blissful nap. When I woke up, I made myself a coffee and got ready for a Diwali meet.

The meet was lovely—great company, warm smiles, and delicious food. I came back home with a full heart and resumed some painting work I’d started earlier. The wall filled with scribbles and memories took more time to touch up, and though there’s still a bit left to finish in the kitchen, the progress felt satisfying.

Now I’m taking a well-deserved break, sitting on the couch, debating whether or not to pour myself a drink to unwind. The day was long, full, and satisfying—and maybe, just maybe, a toast to that is in order. Here’s to decluttering spaces, minds, and finding little joys in between.

guy friendships work too, but first preference is female one. please send me a DM if interested. i will try my best to make you feel comfortable. think of it a genuine shoutout for a friendship.

I have replaced the following:

\- all boiler O-rings

\- steam boiler temperature probes

\- solenoid

\- brew pump

\- OPV bypass valve

I heard some gurgling in the brew boiler so I emptied it to try and get some air out, but no luck.

Even with the new solenoid/pump it's very loud and buzzy... really unsure what the next move is here.

No visible leaks or issues inside. In the video it's running with a blind filter. Same behaviour with regular coffee puck.

If anything, I might take too long to actually take initiative. But the experiences I’ve had lately have left me feeling more than a bit frustrated.

So, there’s this Cuban girl. After a great first date, she seemed interested enough to confirm a second… but then, radio silence. Straight up ghosted. And it’s not like this is new.

Another time, this Bulgarian girl invited me for coffee, which seemed promising. But once we got there, her whole group showed up. Like… was this a date or just a casual hangout? The mixed signals were real.

Then there was this girl I met at a cannabis joint. Things got physical super fast, but she later made it clear she’s mainly into women. I could be wrong, but the whole thing left me confused.

And it’s not just dates—I get mixed signals even in more casual social situations. For example, I’ll catch women glancing at me, or getting visibly nervous when I approach, but the moment I try to connect more, things just go cold. Even with friendships, sometimes it feels like I’m ghosted if I keep things strictly friendly.

I think a lot of people see me as conventionally attractive, and that does seem to get me a lot of attention, but it’s not meaningful attention. Maybe my autism plays a role here; maybe I’m misinterpreting cues or not fully “getting” the social rules at play. All I know is I keep attracting unavailable or “complicated” women.

Just wondering—has anyone else here had similar experiences? And how do you guys handle the frustration of these constant dead-ends?",1,1730597155.0,dating,1,1.0,False

But the ban has been in place for 2 months now, and it was announced over 12 months in advance. Businesses have had over 14 months to work through ordered stock and to replace non-complying containers with ones that comply.

Every fall it's the same story, as soon as the weather changes she spends her days inside and pees and poops all over the house.

When she was younger we had another cat who was very dominant and would sit in wait outside or behind the litter box, sometimes parked by it so she couldn't use it. Even though we gave that cat up for adoption, it traumatized our girl so deep that she refused to use a litter box ever again. We tried everything, and I mean everything, but nothing worked. We spent three years mopping up after her. We rented so we had to pay for the floors to be replaced.

We eventually moved out, got a house and she became an outdoor cat immediately. Never left the garden but she loved it. As long as it was warm outside, then it became problematic. Five years we've tried training her to use the box but nothing seems to work. We love her so much but it's just so tiring. Every floor in every room in the house is now completely destroyed. 

Fall/winter is six months and I would love to not step in a pool of pee and scoop every morning before coffee.

Honestly my greatest achievement in a while. I'm a notoriously bad test taker... i don't remember the last time I passed an exam on the first try. I even failed my driving test on the first try. For this exam, I made it a personal goal to pass on the first try just to prove to myself I can do it! Here are my findings:

1) I never used SH, but I did use prepcast. Prepcast q's were very wordy but extremely helpful in giving me the lay of the land when it came to this exam. I'm sure SH delivers the same effect. I would reccomend using any simulator that works best for you, but practice exams nonetheless, are CRUCIAL for success. I did about 1100 questions over, including 2 full mock exams. My first full mock exam score was 65% AT|BT|BT. 2nd score was 76% AT|T|T. I left it at that and didn't bother with another. I was averaging around low 70's on the simulator practice questions overall.

2) I religiously watched DM and AR videos. Drag & Drops, mindset videos, Agile, you name it! I would pause the video at every question and try to answer it myself. Then I would watch them solve the q! For those videos, I ranged 90% before writing the exam.

3) I made the dumb mistake of reading the PMBOK 7th ED front to back... it's not necessary and HIGHLY boring. The worst read of my life. Equivalent to reading a dictionary.

4) I should've read more of the Rita textbook but instead I skimmed through it. It solidified my knowledge. I religiously played the Rita Process Chart game until i got 100% 3 times in a row.

5) I did take a paid 1 month course for my total education hours needed to apply, and that was awesome. Really helped kickstart my learning. MUCH needed.

6) everyone studies differently. For me, reading a textbook has no effect. I learn better by doing and watching. So the practice exams and the DM/AR vids really helped!

7) MINDSET. Know the PM, Waterfall, AGILE mindset like the back of your hand. 

8) STRATEGY. You are on a time crunch. Doing the mock exams will really help with time blocking and prioritizing certain q's over other. Flag the ones you cant answer within 1.2 mins, and come back to it at the end! 

9) be CONFIDENT. Walk in there with your shoulders back and a smile on your face, ready to crush this exam because YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF!!! You got this. Confidence is key. 

10) Holistic approach to studying. I nourished my body and mind with healthy foods high in Omega-3's (salmon, eggs, almonds) the day before and the morning before the exam. Exercise throughout the week. A nice long walk the day before. Limited screen time the day before. NO STUDYING the day before! Big breakfast, coffee and 8 hours of sleep makes a world of a difference.

I am a 25 year old male. I am having persistent pain in my belly (centered usually a bit lower or a bit above the belly button, extending wide to the sides) for more than two years. I would humbly like to ask for the help of any good willing person who might be able to help me out with this, as it has severely destroyed my life, and is affecting my mental health very heavily. 


I have done the following tests:

Coeliac disease - Negative

Lactose intolerance - Negative

Chromogranin A - Negative

Diabetes was ruled out by a blood screening

Colonoscopy - Negative

Gastroscopy - Antrumgastritis, duodenitis

Abdominal ultrasound - Negative

Parasitology - Blastocystis hominis (tried to eradicate with tinidazol, but according the the infectologist, this is unlikely to be the root cause of the problem)

Lactulose breathing test - Negative

Stool elastase - Negative

Calprotectin - Negative

Hystamine DAO - negative 

Blood tests - Quite normal, very minor differences

There was one weird period when my limbs were hurting as well for two weeks, and I could not move easily around 4 months ago. There was also a period when I had sulphur burps. Otherwise, I only have this pain in the belly. Sometimes I only feel it mildly, even for 1-2 days it can be quite okay, but usually I have this ""gnawing"" kind of pain, on an average day ranging from 5 to 7 on a scale of 10, where 10 is the worst. It is surely not psychosomatic as of now, though it may have started as such, because it occured first after a stressful period of my life, but also it started immediately after a trip to a foreign (Mediterranean) country. I don't have diarrhea usually. When I used to have the sulphur burps (described earlier), then I woke up at night and had diarrhea. This did not happen more frequently than once every two weeks. Stools are not as solid as they used to be, maybe more floaty, more 'cloudy' so to speak, also maybe a bit paler, but still not very far from what I would consider normal. 
I am 168 cm high, and currently 50 kg (my maximum at age 21 was 62 kg, this illness started  at age 23, and then I used to be ~57 kg). 
I started taking probiotics and enzymes two weeks ago, they have no effect practically. 

Please, if anyone might have answers, help me! I am very much saddened and at the end of my energies, and I would appreciate the help of any good willing person who might have some info that can help me out here. I am very thankful to everyone who has read this, and who might give me some useful advice. 


I tried low FODMAP and low carb diet, they didn't work. I don't drink coffee and alcohol and I don't smoke. What I do notice is that sometimes it is way better after diarrhea (presumably when my bowels are emptied).",1,1730596432.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I am then connecting two pieces of wood connected to that base center piece (which will be at the center of the table) at a 30 degree angle in opposite directions. I don’t want the two pieces of wood that serve as the feet for the table top extend beyond the table top’s width or length. How long should those two pieces be?

I am a 25 year old male. I am having persistent pain in my belly (centered usually a bit lower or a bit above the belly button, extending wide to the sides) for more than two years. I would humbly like to ask for the help of any good willing person who might be able to help me out with this, as it has severely destroyed my life, and is affecting my mental health very heavily. 


I have done the following tests:

Coeliac disease - Negative

Lactose intolerance - Negative

Chromogranin A - Negative

Diabetes was ruled out by a blood screening

Colonoscopy - Negative

Gastroscopy - Antrumgastritis, duodenitis

Abdominal ultrasound - Negative

Parasitology - Blastocystis hominis (tried to eradicate with tinidazol, but according the the infectologist, this is unlikely to be the root cause of the problem)

Lactulose breathing test - Negative

Stool elastase - Negative

Calprotectin - Negative

Hystamine DAO - negative 

Blood tests - Quite normal, very minor differences

There was one weird period when my limbs were hurting as well for two weeks, and I could not move easily around 4 months ago. There was also a period when I had sulphur burps. Otherwise, I only have this pain in the belly. Sometimes I only feel it mildly, even for 1-2 days it can be quite okay, but usually I have this ""gnawing"" kind of pain, on an average day ranging from 5 to 7 on a scale of 10, where 10 is the worst. It is surely not psychosomatic as of now, though it may have started as such, because it occured first after a stressful period of my life, but also it started immediately after a trip to a foreign (Mediterranean) country. I don't have diarrhea usually. When I used to have the sulphur burps (described earlier), then I woke up at night and had diarrhea. This did not happen more frequently than once every two weeks. Stools are not as solid as they used to be, maybe more floaty, more 'cloudy' so to speak, also maybe a bit paler, but still not very far from what I would consider normal. 
I am 168 cm high, and currently 50 kg (my maximum at age 21 was 62 kg, this illness started  at age 23, and then I used to be ~57 kg). 
I started taking probiotics and enzymes two weeks ago, they have no effect practically. 

Please, if anyone might have answers, help me! I am very much saddened and at the end of my energies, and I would appreciate the help of any good willing person who might have some info that can help me out here. I am very thankful to everyone who has read this, and who might give me some useful advice.

1gibj06,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gibj06/attachment_problem/,Attachment Problem,"Hi, I'm 26f, been single for my whole life. Throughout my life, I have fallen in love a couple of times, but I wasn't able to confess at all.  
I'm afraid to ruin any friendship that we had to confess, a very typical problem you could see anywhere.   
  
I might have an attachment problem, I was raised by a sitter all the time, and I had many episodes where I would cry and emotionally break whenever my parents changed my sitter. I find it very easy to befriend people but take it very hard whenever they have to leave me (moving out, back to their town, country, etc). I would have very negative thoughts 1-2 days after they left.   
  
Something that sounds like ""Oh the moment we had together was so amazing, I can't stand the thought that I might forget all of those fun times in the future"" and ""With time I'll be changing and they'll also change, and the connections that we had now will disappear"" ""I'm fine and satisfied with what I felt and all of the memories that still last rn, I want everything to end""

I recently moved to Japan, and I've been here for 6 months, living in a share house. I've been to Japan a couple of times to study, I speak I would say fluent Japanese, and I can read between the 'lines' that's how far I'm with my Japanese understanding.

Living here I met him (26m) Japanese man, a free-spirited coffee-lover. He's a super chill person, I've been here for 1.5 years but have never been successful in making any Japanese friends at all, but him, I could tell he's different and we clicked since day one. He just recently broke up with her gf of 3 years and moved here.

We spent a lot of time together, we hung out and chill at the river, park, and house a couple of times a week. Sometimes he would ask me out for lunch, and we would go around the city just to talk and have fun together.  
I don't drink so we never drink together, but the stories we'd talk about are about as deep as they can be. We always wish happiness for each of us, as we have our own relationship problems.  
He said that he's not into relationships, too bothersome, etc, while I am a person who doesn't believe in relationships, I'm too afraid to start one.  
  
We went on a trip together recently, a farewell trip because he's leaving the house and Japan by the end of November. Nothing happened during the trip, we just enjoyed each other company.  Way too comfy, and now I want more, I wish he never left and stayed.

But he left 2 days ago, I was having a breakdown (again) because of it. He's still here in Japan 1 hour away, he told me to go to his town to hang some more before he left. But I'm considering not contacting him anymore, cuz I can't stand being sad anymore, and what I want has turned into something more than a friend.

He'll leave for good in 3 weeks, what should I do?? Should I stay as a friend? should I confess?? should I just let it flow away, let the time heal?  
My heart feels heavy, I can't focus on many things these days.

I have a VertuolLine machine (Vertuo pop+). I am new to Nespresso and their business model; I became aware of them this year, and I received my first machine in October. 

After getting my machine, I did a quick google search to see what selection of Vertuo pods I could get because I’m not the biggest fan of Nespresso coffee. However, I like iced coffee, and I prefer my coffee beverages sweet, so I am able to alter the *strong* taste of the pods and enjoy them. I was disappointed that I only have Nespresso and Starbucks to choose from though. I understand they currently have a patent on the Vertuo pods, and I believe Google said their patent doesn’t expire until 2030. I realize the patent stays closed to competitors until it expires. 

That said, they’ve had a licensing agreement with Starbucks since 2019. Yes, Nespresso **produces the Vertuo pods themselves**, but it’s still Starbucks coffee, isn’t it? I’d like to one day see a variety of Vertuo pods that’s akin to the variety of K-cups (Keurig). Does anyone know why they only have a licensing agreement with Starbucks and no one else?

Do you think Nespresso will ever broker more licensing deals with other coffee brands before the 2030 patent expires? Or do you think their business model for the Vertuo pods will remain as is until the patent expires and they’re forced to allow third-party pods on their Vertuo machines?

Hello guys.

I’m living in Switzerland. 

I had a capsule machine , but I wasn’t happy with this coffee. Now I want to try an espresso machine. I watched some reviews, but I have one specific problem. We are living in old design apartment and my wife want to have a beautiful old designed machine, like Smeg , I have read reviews about the Smeg, Reviews say the price/quality is not great, (but I read only about small one) , so if someone are using Smeg, please share your opinions , naturally I want to buy a good coffee machine, but I also want it to be in this style. It would be nice if the company have other appliances like kettle, toaster in the same style.

So If you know some good espresso machine with similar style, please share. Also I found beautiful coffee machine Ascaso Dream PID. But not sure about the quality of this machine , maybe someone used it or know something about it.

Also It should have a steamer as I preferred latte macchiato and cappuccino.

About me:
I am a 25 year old living and working in Durham region. My job is a technical role and I like to think of myself as a technical person. One life philosophy I like to follow is that consistency almost always wins out over the long term. Cliché I know but I find it to be very true! 

I consider myself to be an ethical vegan and animal rights supporter. Being vegan isn't an expectation of mine but I prefer people who are at least open to the philosophy. I am also a proud mama of a chocolate Labrador retriever and would love to share pictures of her upon request :).

I was raised as a gamer/nerdy type so if you like video games that's a huge plus. I grew up on games like Spyro, crash, cod, halo and WoW. I don't think I have a huge ego but fair warning I can be competitive at times ;). As far as TV goes I am a huge fan of most things Disney so if you have any favorites let me know! Beyond that I am generally into most things comedy and drama. Right now I am rewatching big mouth on Netflix!

A few simple pleasures I enjoy; music, baths, coffee, listening to a rainstorm, a nice glass of wine.

Physically I am of small stature (168cm and 125lbs) with blue eyes, dirty blonde shoulder length hair and fair skin. 

What I'm looking for:
Someone who is first and foremost stable and dependable. Someone who values a monogamous relationship structure. I think mutual interests and beliefs are also very important so I would love to chat about your life philosophies and views. One other note is I'm not looking to ever raise children in case that's important to you.  I prefer someone my age or slightly older but I can be flexible. My physical preferences are varied but generally I like men who are slightly taller and I don't mind a little bit of a dad bod. 

As I don't want this post to go on for too long I will end it off here. Hopefully I've been successful thus far in conveying some of the important bits about myself. If I seem like the type of person you'd enjoy talking with please don't be shy!",1,1730595580.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,0.67,False

My partner took me to the ER and they suspected appendix issues so they ran numerous blood tests, a urine analysis, and a CT. My blood pressure was also slightly elevated, so they put me on a continuous blood pressure monitor that checked me every 10 minutes. It stayed pretty consistently elevated for the duration of my time in the ER
CT came back normal, no appendix inflammation or anything. White blood cell count was fine so no indication of a virus. Urine results where fine too. They didn't know the cause, they sent me home and said to follow up with my primary care doc. I made an appointment for this coming Monday. 

The following days after that, and today, have been rough. 
Can't keep much food down. Not continuously vomiting but my stomach feels very inflamed, bloated, and uncomfortable, i feel hunger but any large amount of food and I feel unbearably sick. Had to leave work early on Thursday from vomiting. 
I have a history of random allergies that seem to come and go, I believe I have MCAS but I'm not formally diagnosed. In the past I've had similar symptoms, but I kept getting turned away from a GI refferal because at the time I smoked cannabis (I'm 2 years sober now). My diet has been pretty typical for someone my age. It's notable I had waffles the night before this started. I'm thinking Im having an allergic reaction to gluten or dairy. I've cut those out, and when I have eaten the last few days it's been mostly polenta, or almond flour crackers, which I seem to keep down fine and settle well.
Today I felt like I was finally feeling better, I ordered a coffee at my favorite coffee place (I know this was a mistake) I asked for non dairy milk just in case since dairy has been a trigger for me before, but they messed my drink up and I just drank it anyways (another mistake)
Now I'm having hives, I'm dizy, and I'm pretty certain my blood pressure is elevated again but I haven't used my at home cuff, but I probably will. 
I'm scheduled to work on Monday before my appointment but I feel absolutely awful. I'm not sure if I should just hang in there and wait, take an antihistamine like benedryl, or go back to the ER. My hives aren't super severe at this point but they're getting worse. 
I just don't really know what this could be since all my ER tests were normal. I'm extremely uncomfortable, which is having an effect on my anxiety. 
My bipolar is extremely well managed at this point in my life but I'm worried it has an effect on how doctors treat me when I go to the ER since it's on my medical records. I also definitely get anxiety when I have health issues so I wouldn't be able to decern if the very light chest discomfort I'm feeling is anxiety or not. I've also been extremely fatigued during this and napping a few times a day which is something I never do.
I guess any kind advice or encouragement is all I'm looking for. I'm just uncomfortable and just want to eat. ",1,1730595300.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1gib7eb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gib7eb,Guys noor here liver related ,"So , from my last test my liver enzymes report have increased ALKALINE PHOSPHATE FROM 494 unit/L to 519 unit /L and I feel pretty normal sometimes nauseous here and there which might be due to drinking black coffee . But my concern is serum albumin which has increased from 44 to 49 g/L and normal range is 35-50 g/L well my rest liver reports are normal and I have not been diagnosed from a liver disease and these levels have risen from trikafta  pre trikafta my levels were serum albumin being 41 g/L and alkaline phosphate being 360-430. Is it concerning I have sent the message to my nurse to rebook blood or start ursodeoxycholic acid to lower enzymes . I don’t have a liver disease my scans were normal which I had less than a year ago . Shall I be super worried. My consultant told me they might Strat ursodeo acid thing to lower enzymes. And it does not mean my liver is damaged. I have texted them I just wanna know if it’s normal and shall I force them to start ursodeoxycholic acid if it’s urgent cause they take my liver chill they don’t stress much as I have seen they just monitor it  which is weird cause my consultant once asked me if I wanna start ursodeoxycholic acid if I am too worried well I don’t even know what that was until i googled it and google was a bad option got more scared . I don’t have itchyness I am just worried and sometimes nauseous. ",3,1730595236.0,CysticFibrosis,1,1.0,False

I wasnt a bad energy drinker, i only made keurig ice coffees and drank the bottled starbucks coffee drinks. Its driving me insane and just trying to see if anyone has any tips to combat this? Ive been drinking nothing but water and stopped any sort of energy drink. i was thinking of maybe trying dark chocolate to bring it down and cut it off when its over?

For context I get up a couple of hours before I have to leave for work because if I'm even the slightest bit stressed in the mornings the rest of the day is liable to be a disaster. Part of my morning routine involves a period of about 20-25 minutes where I sit down, have a cup of coffee, and do something mildly intellectually stimulating. Originally it was a couple of Duolingo lessons, now it's scrolling a few subs on here. I'm beginning to think that starting my day with social media isn't the best idea, so I have (ironically) come to Reddit to ask for advice.

Criteria the activity has to follow:  
\- must be able to be done while stationary and sitting down (my cat usually curls up in my lap for snuggles at this point so it can't be anything that would disturb her)  
\- needs to have a definitive stopping point/ending/time limit, like an episode, lesson, chapter, or other point that would make it easy to switch tasks afterwards  
\- has to involve a visual element so no podcasts, listening to music, etc; ideally should be something I can do on my phone or tablet  
\- should be interesting enough to keep my attention but not so interesting I'll get too engrossed and lose track of time

I'm open to pretty much anything - apps, games, YouTube channels, anything else that would fit with the above. Preferably something free or low cost but I'm flexible as long as it works. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",3,1730595118.0,AutisticWithADHD,4,1.0,False

What I'm looking for:   
I want someone close to me, south central Ohio, who can drive (I can't due to Tourettes but I'd help with gas!). I want to go do fun activities, whether it be look at holiday lights, feed geese, cuddle up and binge a show, or grab coffee and lunches. I just don't want to be alone, I want to cuddle, and feel cared for, I crave the affection and companionship. I'm not much on sex, it's really a take or leave with me as I'm on the ace umbrella of sexuality. I want someone my age or preferably older, think 25-38 ideally, and this sounds weird but due to trauma of abuse, no bald men? I'm sorry that sounds so picky but it's a trauma thing. 

What do you get from dating me?  
You get a number one fan, whether it's you playing games or going to work or just having a day, I'll be there for you! If I'm feeling good, I might bake you something nice and sweet, and I make crafts so you could benefit there. I'm a great listener, funny as all get out (At least my friends say) and I'm plus size so great for cuddling. I'll always be down for cuddles, or a day in, or light activities out and about. I'm absolutely loyal. 

The cons:  
I have mental health issues so I need reassurance a lot? And Tourettes makes me say noises or do movements beyond my control, my knees don't work great but I am mobile, and I mean, I'm just not the best, but maybe I'm perfect for you if we try. 

If you message, tell me your favorite dessert so i know you read this :)",1,1730595105.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.67,False
