We’re still working on fleshing out a plan for a third place style, community focused, used bookstore/coffeeshop that’s open late and serves coffee as well as non alcoholic yummy, functional style beverages. So I’ve got a kick ass business plan all finished and a pretty solid start up budget worked out. Looking around for a good location & still working on potential funding, those obviously are gonna be the biggest hurdles. As it’s a used bookstore, I’m really banking on the idea that we’d be able to procure a good amount of book donations. Everything I’ve heard from other used booksellers makes me feel like that won’t be an issue. They all say that once you start asking you get buried in books. But I’m just afraid it’s a big ask and the community won’t be able to supply what we need & I want to be realistic about planning for that. So my question is: When we get to that stage, which will be after securing a location & a good bit of marketing, would you personally be willing to donate some books? We would give a discount on future purchases, an invite to the soft opening, or something else kind of exclusive to everyone that donates of course. 
Bonus question: How do you feel about something like this (see my previous post if you haven’t seen the original thread about this bookstore idea) having a go fund me or some sort of crowdsourcing from the community? Is that off putting or would you want to be a part of helping us open?

1o9e45r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9e45r,Review #30 - Dettling Cask Strength Single Barrel “It’s all about the family”,"Forethoughts: I am a part of Bourbon Together, we are a national bourbon group on Facebook and do some awesome picks! I didn’t attend the first Dettling pick that happened in 2024 but I was fortunate enough to attend this years pick back in June of 2025. It was a great time getting to meet Seth and Vicky and really be engrossed in what bourbon means to them. I’m no stranger to heat as I’ve grown up in Alabama and Florida my whole life but June in Atmore is no joke! Also, today was Dettling’s big drop for the year and I was lucky enough to snag barrel 470, review whenever it gets in my hands. Now onto the review. 

In the glass: Dettling Cask Strength Single Barrel “It’s all about the Family”, Barrel #488

Distillery: Big Escambia Spirits 

ABV: 57.1%

Proof: 114.2

Age: 5 Years 1 Month

Mashbill: 70% corn, 15% rye, 12% oat, 3% roasted assorted grains (chocolate malted rye, caramel malted barley, malted wheat)

Nose: Quintessential dettling on the nose with chocolate, brownie, dark brown sugar, molasses, rich caramel, tiramisu, and rich oak. Definitely a hint of leather. 

Palate: This bourbon comes through with some nice barrel char, mocha, espresso, a good amount of oak, Ghirardelli dark chocolate, leather bound book, pipe tobacco, almost a bread pudding with chocolate sauce, chocolate Rice Krispies, and just a ton of FLAVOR. Edge of the pan brownie comes to mind, that’s a note we got at the tasting and it’s what drew a lot of people towards picking that barrel. It’s intense and rich, every sip bringing out more flavor than the last. 

Finish: The finish rolls in waves with coffee, oak, more pipe tobacco, and more of those dark brown sugars. There’s a note I always get when a whiskey has spent time in a Kelvin barrel and this one has it, it’s easy to pinpoint and I like it. This one lingers on your tongue for a while and brings a bit of a hug. Truly though, this is a nice sit down pour and enjoy it for an hour. 

Final thoughts: This barrel stands out as one of the better Dettlings I have had. I think there are a few that edge it out for me but not many I can say that confidently. During the pick, I had this as my second choice because barrel 489 stole the show for me that day but that’s neither here nor there. I had a phenomenal time and was able to get my 82 month gold top signed! 

This bottle was a part of a charity involvement for our group for Huntingtons Disease as one of the members has family affected by the disease. We managed to raise $2,420 for donation between money being tacked onto these bottles at checkout and separate raffles. It was great to see that there was a treatment that has emerged for the disease just this year, our group was really pumped about that. 

If you’ve made it this far in the review I appreciate it. If you haven’t found a dettling yet, be patient, he’s working hard to get more out there.

I'm a 21 year old web design graduate, my plan was to secure employment before I graduated and move directly into a new job but 250+ applications, 5 careers events, 70 linkedin posts, and a few coffee meets with recruiters later that still hasn't happened.

I've ran out of savings from my student loans so I've had to go universal credit which is about £300\~ a month for me. I'm living with my parents and have a generally low cost lifestyle but its barely amounting to anything and (crucially) i can't afford a car or driving lessons. Which would be the thing that helps me break the cycle.

About a month before i had to move home i realised i wasn't going to hit my goal and I pivoted to applying for any job i could get near where my parents live (which was only really warehouse and retail work) and I must have applied at every major chain and emailed every pub, resteraunt, and cafe within a 10 mile radius and the only thing i got back from that was an interview at tesco where i was told by the manager i had got the job but got a rejection email a week later.

I'm getting seriously frustrated. my daily routine has basically been reduced to wake up > work on some portfolio projects > apply for jobs > eat > sleep.

This past week though has really tempted me to just quit and worry about finding another job after. I applied for and am currently on a personal LOA to spend the last of my dog's days with her in peace and mourn her afterwards. I have a district manager (DM) that I already didn't like and now after this week I hate them with a fiery passion. To give some context, I've never taken any kind of leave in the over 3 years I've been a barista there. The only time I call out sick is on days where I literally need to go to the hospital, which aren't often (maybe once every couple of months, if that). So then tell me why am I being bothered in the middle of my LOA by management to be told that the DM denied my personal LOA because of understaffing. That's not my problem, and we would've been understaffed anyway even with me there. There are never days where we *aren't* understaffed. This two-faced DM even had the nerve to give me a ""sympathy card"" (not something that was bought, but a small business card-sized card that we always have in the back and wrote on it ""sending you good vibes."" Seriously? Good vibes? Who writes that to somebody who is losing a pet? DM now wants me to change it to medical leave when I wouldn't be able to submit the required forms because they don't exist what they're asking for and it wouldn't apply anyway because medical LOA is supposed to be for the individual and pets don't qualify as family under these kinds of leaves. For pet bereavement you're supposed to use your sick hours, which is still fucked up if you ask me.

TLDR management sucks and has no heart and I want to quit in the middle of my suddenly not-approved personal LOA and worry about finding a job later.",1,1760736880.0,hatemyjob,1,0.67,False

okay so basically there’s this coffee shop really close to my store. we’re talking a 30 second walk. understandably, i go there often for caffeinated drinks and food.

since i’ve been going, ive been chatting more with this particular barista. to me, it seemed like she would go out of her way to take my order or initiate little conversations with me. nothing too crazy or intimate, but possible signs of interest.

now, recently, i’ve been going through the process of transferring to a different store with the same company. i told this to the aforementioned barista, and she seemed a bit disappointed. she asked me how far it was and said that “we’ll miss you.” 

perhaps i read far too much into all of our interactions. regardless, the following week i gave her my phone number. she seemed happy that i did, saying “i’ll miss you” before interrupting herself by saying something along the lines of “now i don’t have to.”

i didn’t get a text that night, which isn’t the end of the world, but the next day i wanted a lil caffeinated drink. the barista was there, and, unprompted by anything i said, she said “sorry i haven’t texted you yet.” and the whole time i was there the vibes seemed a little off. she didn’t look as happy to see me and the convo in general was a bit awkward. 

i’m an avid over thinker and im trying to not worry abt this too much, although i think i screwed up. i feel like i crossed a major boundary by giving her my number. now, i know it isn’t the end of the world that she hasn’t contacted me, but i still feel weird about what i did. i feel like i should give it a couple weeks before going back in to apologize for having given her my number.

1o9dxbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1o9dxbf/deathbird_stories_by_harlan_ellison_partial_review/,Deathbird Stories by Harlan Ellison Partial Review,"I'm reading and reviewing Deathbird Stories by Harlan Ellison. Ellison is one of my favorite writers, and I was able to track down this book to provide a review of each of the stories. Ellison's work warrants an in-depth review. I know he detested his work being sci-fi, but this was the best place to review it (Sorry, Harlan). I won't review every story, as some aren't memorable or not worth discussing.

**Introduction:** Ellison discusses the theme of gods in this book. It's about how the newer gods who rule over humans bestow power upon them, whether consciously or not. This book is quite the downer. He also warns the reader not to read the story in one sitting, as the emotional content is too much to handle.

**The Whimper of Whipped Dogs:** This story is inspired by the real-life murder of Kitty Genovese, who was killed while bystanders witnessed and did nothing. In this fictional story, the narrative follows a woman named Beth, one of the many witnesses to a murder, which is depicted in a visceral, brutal, and unforgiving manner —a style Ellison has consistently employed in the works I've read. While this is happening, the city is in the presence of a death god in the fog that feeds on murder, and there are eyes in the mist.

The next day, Beth meets Ray, a man who also witnessed the murder, and they begin dating, but Ray possesses violent sexual desires and goes on a rant about the true nature of the City. She begins to endure the harshness of the city. Then a man breaks into her apartment to rob her, and then eventually tries to kill her and pushes her on the balcony so everyone can watch, and Beth has to make a choice: Be a victim or a participant.

This is one of Ellison's best stories. This isn't the first time I've read it, but it still holds up. It's visceral and uncompromising. This story tries to rationalize why this murder happened, but the true horror lies in the fact that some people just want to kill others. The real-life murderer wanted to kill a woman. Themes of alienation and violence, as Ellison describes them, are a daimonic necessity for contact. The apathy of the watchers, who succumb to the city's death god, is the story's most horrifying aspect. **Rating 10/10.**

**Along the Scenic Route:** Freeway drivers can soon challenge one another to duels under official supervision. George is out on a drive with his new, upgraded car and wife, Jessica, when he gets cut off by another driver, who then challenges him to a duel.

A story about the Chromed-Plated Killer God: this was a decent read, written in a simple style. What futuristic road rage could look like. A nice break from the previous story. **Rating: 7/10.**

**On the Downhill Side:** This story is about two ghosts, Paul and Lizette, accompanied by Paul's unicorn, who walk the streets of New Orleans, enjoying coffee, visiting the Irish Quarter, the Royal Orleans Hotel, and ultimately ending up at the Saint Louis Cemetery. While they do this, they share stories about their lives, including love, regrets, and the opportunities they have missed. Paul reminds her that soon they will be on the downhill side. At the cemetery, bodies lie in crypts above ground because the water table is only eighteen inches below the surface, and the gods demand a sacrifice.

I enjoyed this story. The characters reflecting on their lives, their regrets, brought the piece to be sentimental, which is rare in the collection (so far). I loved the poetic and atmospheric imagery used to convey the essence of New Orleans. **Rating: 7.5/10.**

**Basilisk:** This follows Vernon Lustig, a soldier imprisoned during the Vietnam War. He was injured by a boobytrap and captured and tortured. During this, he becomes possessed by a creature called a Basilisk and ends up killing his captors. He is rescued by the U.S. but is court-martialed and returns to his hometown in Kansas, where his neighbors, family, and friends must deal with the negative ramifications of his case. He ends up taking revenge against the people of the town.

This was a dark story dealing with the horrors of war and how soldiers return to people who don't or won't understand what happened. Ellison uses imagery to put us into Vernon's Point of View. He's a master at metaphorical imagery. This story features a lot of visceral violence and action. Still, it's the quiet moments with Vernon's ex-girlfriend, Teresa, who is married to an ex-football player, and his sister, Neola, who had to leave town because of what he had done, that make this story hit harder emotionally. **Rating: 9/10.**

**Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes:** This is a story about a lonely gambler named Kostner who ends up in Las Vegas. While gambling at the slot machines, he wins a substantial amount. He keeps winning, only to realize the slot machine is haunted by a woman named Maggie. Maggie is a prostitute seducing men for the money, and ends up at the same slot machine where she dies, and helps Kostner win tons of money.

From the premise, this may seem like a boring story. Still, Ellison's excellent and vivid characterization of Maggie and Kostner, along with the brutal emotions explored in each character, make it a compelling one—another great example of capturing the Vegas setting. The god of gambling addiction was explored in this one. One of Ellison's best stories. **Rating: 10/10.**

**Shattered Like A Glass Goblin:** This follows Veteran Rudy, who comes to L.A. and ends up at a rundown house called The Hill looking for his girlfriend Kristina. There are other drug addicts in the home as well, and Rudy ends up as a manager there. He ends up taking drugs and transforms into a goblin made of glass.

Ellison tackles drug use and how it destroys you and the relationships around you. Kafka has always been an influence on Ellison's work, as seen in stories like ""In Fear of K and Repent, Harlequin,"" and this story is no exception. I would have liked more character development from this before things go off the rails, as the story lacks the intended emotional punch. It's still a good story. **Rating: 7.5/10.**

**Delusion for a Dragon Slayer:** This follows William Glazer Griffin, who is killed by a falling wrecking ball and ends up in an afterlife of his own dreams. He's in a heroic fantasy world where he's a barbarian ship captain, and he embarks on an adventure to fight a dragon and rescue the damsel in distress. Throughout this, we learn of his true nature as a selfish, flawed, and quietly evil individual.

This was another great and interesting story, a meta-commentary on heroes' journeys, showing that stories, and heroic stories in particular, are often based on self-deception and can conceal one's true nature. After Griffin slays the dragon, he rapes the woman and then the dragon is about to devour him, he realizes his true nature. There is a prologue that details four real people who died of cruel chance. I'm not sure how much it contributed to the story, but it shows Ellison knew a great deal. This story was about the God of self-delusion, which we create ourselves. **Rating: 9/10.**

Another coincidence was that this character shares the same name (Griffin) as Griffith from Berserk. My favorite manga of all time features a character named Griffith, who is also a rapist.

**Calibration**

Nobody in their right mind would ever volunteer to become the first human to be cloned, and yet I did. The payment was really good, half a million dollars per clone, upwards to ten iterations before payments ceased, with an initial upfront payment of ten grand. Hey, five million dollars is five million dollars, and I was in enough holes as it was that I figured why not? Why not hand over the very genetic essence that made me me to some soulless monolithic bioegineering corporation for a few million bucks? Everybody has a price and I just so happened to be in the right position to be easily persuaded.

The initial appointment involved nothing more than walking into a sterile clinic ran by the benefactors where I filled out my name (Robert Pullman), sex (M), age (34), marital status (Single), and so on. Extremely basic stuff, they didn’t even ask for my family history, said that there was no need to ask because it was all in the DNA anyways. They didn’t even draw my blood, just swabbed the inside of my mouth, and that was that. Easiest ten grand I’ve ever made. “We’ll contact you when the first clone is successful,” the doctor said. She had introduced herself to me earlier as Doctor Byrgenwerth. She wasn’t much older than me, maybe younger actually, but she carried herself in a way that made her feel like she was much older. She had this stoic detachment about her, like she was not just observing the scene from behind her eyes but she also outside of herself, watching the scene play out the distance as her mind toiled away on some problem far far away. Despite this I found her very attractive, her smooth skin, nice dark hair up in a bun. I wanted to ask her out, but I didn’t. I thanked her and all communications ceased for years, regretting not asking her for at least a coffee date.

Three long years before I ever heard back. Three years of wasting away in a pile of debt that only grew, festering upon itself. I lost myself into fantasies of what I imagined life to be like if I had asked out Doctor Byrgenwerth, if I could have swooned her over and married a pretty lady with much more money and smarts than me. I did my usual research, but she was a ghost, she had no presence online. The mystique only intrigued me more. The ten grand disappeared as fast as it had been deposited in my bank account. Sucked away into the blackhole of loans and leases. I feared that by the time the biocorp got back with me that I would be in such a blackhole that even their payouts, if they ever did happen, wouldn’t even be enough to satisfy this monster who had trapped me. And then one day, somewhere deep in my fifth drink of the afternoon, Doctor Byrgenwerth called me. She spoke with the same detached voice I remembered. Solving problems elsewhere, no time for the present. In that stoic tone she told me that their experiments would soon be over, that they had successfully grown me in a vat in a far off lab north of the Arctic Circle, but it was scheduled to arrive at their regional offices in two days, she told me that in order to properly be paid I would have to come. When I asked why, she simply said “calibration,” followed with “Thank you for your time. We will see you on Tuesday.” And so, I drank myself to sleep, giddy that I would have half a million dollars in just a few days, and more importantly: I would be seeing Doctor Byrgenwerth again.

Doctor Byrgenwerth greeted me in the lobby the moment I arrived, before I even had a chance to talk to the receptionist. She hadn’t looked a day older, still as beautiful as the first day I had seen her. A woman who really cared about her skin and hair care routines, even if she never seemed fully present to really appreciate them, and she had a smile on her face. Something about it weirded me out. She seemed so present, so there, as if for once the problem she was attempting to solve aligned with her physical location in space. I made a mental note to ask her out after this was over.

“Follow me Mister Pullman,” she said, voice relaxed and slightly cheerful, but still with an air of detachment, but only in a professional way. I did so, the receptionist didn’t even once look up from his desk. 

Doctor Byrgenwerth lead to an elevator that took us down, deep down into the roots of the building. I followed her across the labyrinth of pristine white hallways, empty and devoid of any forms of life. Just whiteness everywhere. White walls, white ceilings with blinding white LEDs, and white tiling. Even Doctor Byrgenwerth‘s lab coat seemed to blend into the whiteness like camouflage. I began to feel self conscious for wearing my dark blue t-shirt and jeans. The deeper we went the more I felt like I was being led into the bowels of a sleeping beast. But I reminded myself, half a million dollars, maybe more. I could be beyond debt free soon.

We arrived at the single door I had seen past the elevator. A dull gray door. It’s grayness, or more specifically, it’s non-whiteness, felt like it shouldn’t belong down there. Like it was a blemish, an imperfection within the pristine sterile void of light. She swiped her badge against a dark reader, and opened the door. A dark room that swallowed all light. A rectangular blackhole. I followed her in, and the door clicked shut behind me.

My eyes adjusted to the dull light inside the room. Machines beeped, and somewhere I heard the sputtering of a printer running continuously like an old school seismograph, a nonstop scratching of pens against paper. Inside the room a small handful of other scientists stood at machines, the dull blue light of their screens radiating off of the faces. In the center of the room was a transparent curtain, shimmering in the ambient lighting of the room, a ghostly veil, with a body lying on a table within it. Doctor Byrgenwerth lead me to it. 

All four sides of the table had been contained within the veil. A protective barrier of plastic square. In it, in matching clothes laid me, my body, asleep or dead, I could not tell. The only thing it donned that I did not was a thick black collar around its neck. The uneasiness of seeing oneself asleep in a room like this is something I could never forget. I felt like how I perceived Doctor Byrgenwerth to be: detached and hovering over my body, existing elsewhere.

“How do you feel, seeing yourself?” Doctor Byrgenwerth asked. Her voice slightly detached. Already solving a problem elsewhere.

“It’s trippy,” I said wide a slight chuckle. Although it did not brush off the unease that had begun to colonize within me. Only a mask. “Did you say something about the Arctic Circle on the phone? Do they need to be grown in cold environments?” I realized then that the room we stood in was not cold, perfectly room temp.

“Human cloning is hard, cloning the body is easy, but the soul is hard. We discovered something that can help with that up there. That is all I can legally say.” She said.

Legally say. Her saying that reminded me that this was not some pet project of an eccentric scientist, but of a bureaucratic monolith. She was just an asset to the faceless chimera that drove this research. As disposable as the rest of us. It reminded me that she was at least human, bounded by the arbitrary rules and borders that bounded us all.

“We’re going to begin calibration.” Doctor Byrgenwerth said.

“Calibration of what?” I asked.

“The soul, of course.” She answered. “Start the process,” she said to the room. The scientists looked up from their screens momentarily before returning to them.

The body, my body, began to stir on the table. It’s muscles twitching. Its rib cage rising and falling in a more pronounced manner. Half a million dollars, I reminded myself. Just do this once and all will be wiped free.

“What’s the collar for?” I asked as my body continued to adjust itself.

“Contingency,” she said.

Before I could ask further my body on the table pulled itself up, sitting on the table. It opened its eyes and turned towards me. Not the room, but me. Those eyes, the same eyes I saw in the mirror every morning, usually bleary and hungover, the same eyes that I gazed in wondering why I had thrown so much away, over and over again. The same eyes I had spoken to even though they were nothing more than my own, saying “last night was the last time, we’re going to fix this today,” over and over again, now looked at me but controlled by something else.

“What is your name?” Doctor Byrgenwerth said, addressing the clone.

“Robert Pullman,” it said with my voice. Not breaking eye contact with me. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. I was too amazed, too terrified to look away.

“What’s your age?” Doctor Byrgenwerth.

“Thirty seven,” it said. It spoke with a slight amusement.

“Where is your hometown?”

“Everdeen, Florida. Just an hour and a half north of the happiest place on Earth.”

Doctor Byrgenwerth turned to me. “Is that correct?” She asked. Stunned at the clone’s knowledge I struggled to get the words out, so instead I nodded my head. “I’m going to need you to confirm whether the info is correct or not going forward.” I nodded.

“Who was your first crush?”

“Dawn Brickman, every guy wanted to be with her. I had no shot. Didn’t stop me from trying. I did my research, learned enough about her and tried to impress her with my specific knowledge. She was not amuse.”

I felt my muscles tighten. My clone continued to stare into my eyes, with a relaxed amused smile across his face.

“Is that correct?” Doctor Byrgenwerth asked.

I nodded, as hard as it was.

“What is your biggest success in life?”

“I once won three grand at a casino, my first time ever playing roulette. It’s been downhill ever since. One debt after another.”

I nodded. Not knowing why other than the fact that I did not want to disobey.

“What is your biggest regret in life?”

My clone laughed. A genuine laugh, then spoke. “I have many regrets, too many to count. I could write a whole dissertation on them if I wanted to. But the one I’ve been mulling over the most lately, that’s been eating at me, is not asking you out on a date that day we met three years ago. Which is to say, will you go out with me?” He broke eye contact with me then, and only then, to look at her.

“Who is the original?” Doctor Byrgenwerth said, not remarking on the comment.

“I am of course,” my clone said. “All consciousness stems from my resting body, dreaming your many lives.” He looked at me again. “You’re the copy.” He smiled.

“Disengage,” Doctor Byrgenwerth said. I heard a click from a scientist behind me. Followed by a boom. My head, my clone’s head erupted into a smattering explosion of red. Blood splattered all across the transparent veil. Red, nothing but red. I jumped, shocked at what I had just seen. The causal detached murder of my own body. When the blood settled I saw it, lying on the ground. The black collar no more, and my headless body covered in its own blood.

Doctor Byrgenwerth sighed. “It’s as we feared. The mother psyche is too attached, and too honest. We’ll try again in a few more weeks,” she looked at me. I turned my head to face her. Whatever attraction I had been feeling towards her was gone. Evaporated away along with my clone’s head. I wanted nothing more than to get out of there.

“This could be a good thing,” one of the scientists said. “We can use the honesty of the psyche as leverage. Feasible clones can wait, but this could help us in the short term. It was the plan B.”

“Hmm,” is all she said as she gazed upon my deceased body.

Shortly she guided me back through that maze of corridors until we entered the elevators that deposited us into the lobby. I said nothing during the whole journey.

“Upon exiting the lobby you will be half a million dollars richer,” she said. “See you in a few weeks for another calibration round?”

“I uh, I uh...” I said looking for an excuse.

“No need to respond,” she said, voice returning to that detachment. “The question is merely rhetorical. We will be seeing you in a few weeks for the next calibration.”

I nodded. “Sure,” I said. “I will be seeing you in two weeks.”

I walked as fast as I could out of there, passing the receptionist who still was head down in whatever distraction he was entertaining himself with, when Doctor Byrgenwerth spoke out again. I froze.

“Mister Pullman,” she said. I stopped, heart pounding.

I turned around, but said nothing.

“The answer is no,” she said.

“To what?” I asked, weakly.

“Coffee, I’m too busy at work as you can tell, and frankly you are not my type. Our relationship is to remain strictly professional. Do you understand?”

I nodded. “Yes, I understand.” I said turning towards the door and walking away, feeling the pressure of Doctor Byrgenwerth‘s press upon my back.",1,1760736764.0,QuadrantNine,0,1.0,False

Breakfast - the usual porridge, extra honey today!! with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries. I also forget to mention my coffee with honey lol 10/10

Snack - fresh sourdough, butter, jam, two babybels and almonds (genuinely I eat so many of these throughout the day so good, not weighing everything is so freeing) and tea with sugarrrr 10/10

Lunch - Greggs egg mayo sandwich (I  LOVE EGG MAYO and finally let myself have it, it was a stupid ED rule), quavers (also a big challenge, stupid ED rule and they weren't as good as wotsits imo), apple and strawberries 11/10

Snack - Mikado dipped in tea again with more almonds 9/10

Dinner - Chicken in a new seasoning, tomatoes, broccoli, mixed veg and a cheesy jacket potato 7.5/10

Dessert - Lindt, risen toffee, more almonds and milk bottles with dad - unreal 10/10 (reused photo bc I forgot to take one btw 🤣)

Snack - more sourdough, jam, butter (hyper fixation lol) with yogurt and fruit (banana!! A fear but I love) 10/10 glad I switched this snack up but would love to know other people’s pre bed snacks! 

A mentally challenging day, but I pushed through because I know what I want for my life and my dad has been such a great support, he really doesn't want me to go back. My bloods came back okay, one of my liver enzymes was ever so slight elevated, this is expected tbh from such prolonged starvation (anything over 32 flags up, last time it was 31, today it was 36 - the last time before I was admitted it was 55, the PA said she isn't worried its really only if its over 40). Hopefully the consultant also won't be worried but I didn't hear from the team today so it means I will be home over the weekend, YAY!! I really hope then come Monday I can checked in with the team and say everything is going well and then hopefully Wednesday I will have gained and they won't readmit me!  Dad has assured me on Wednesday at my appointment he will give me all his support and tell them how well I've been doing if I keep going the way I am going!

Also that's my dad telling you all Tesco milk bottles aren't as good as Sainsbury's lol, we still ate them though!

A little rant about today, I feel like I am eating so much but I am panicking that it won't be enough to prove to my team I can do it at home, I don't know if that's the ED telling me that, but I am panicking my weight won't go up/go up enough and they'll put me in anyways! I also struggled a bit with food noise today, for example at afternoon snack I felt I could have/wanted to eat more and for dinner although dad chose my dinner I felt I could have eaten two jackets no problem, the same with dessert, like I didn't want to stop eating milk bottles, but I just ate my portion plus one more. Yet at breakfast I felt soooo full by the end of my porridge, it is really strange. It's very hard to navigate this, any tips are appreciated. I also struggled in Greggs to choose what to have. I am glad I chose the egg mayo sandwich because I've been craving it for agesss but then I argue with myself should I have had this because its more challenging or maybe I would have enjoyed it more, but I then just tell myself I can have it a different time! 

Also had SO many thoughts this afternoon, 'I am eating too many carbs' 'I am not eating enough fruit and veg' 'I am going to be deficient in protein because I am not eating enough' BUT I battled through and am SO SO proud, because seriously FUCK my ED, I have such a beautiful life to live with my dad, doggo and family and I am not letting this illness take anymore of my life - I am regaining my life after TOO long. Regaining my relationship with my sister after these rough few weeks, she has pretty much given up on me and said she doesn't want to spend time with me until I commit and get better because it is too hard for her to see me like this, so this is a massive motivation atm. Also I told my dad about this sub, I read him some of the comments and he cried, he loves it. Once again hope you are all well!!",6,1760736674.0,recoveryplates,0,1.0,False

1o9dumv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pattaya/comments/1o9dumv/farang_simulator_the_board_game/,🎲 Farang Simulator: The Board Game,"# A drunk idea that somehow makes too much sense

I lived in Pattaya for a year. Had my own stories… and heard enough from other farangs to fill a soap opera. Somewhere between hangovers and hookers, this idea was born.

Originally, I wanted to make an **isometric video game** — you’d walk around Pattaya, talk to people, drink, smoke weed, and fuck prostitutes in mini-games.  
Never started it. Shocking, I know.

Then I figured — this could actually work as a **board game**.  
Later, I started building a small **digital version** to test the mechanics.  
And then it hit me: if it’s not physical, I don’t need to limit the map size, the number of decks, or the types of places.

Anyway, here’s how the **original “real-life” board version** worked — before I decided to expand it.



# 🏙️ The Map & Phases

There’s a **city map** with different spots to visit.  
Each day has two phases: **Day** and **Night**.

You’ve got a **drunkenness level** from 0 to 5.  
Go above 5 → you black out, day ends, and you wake up in the next one (hopefully with pants on).



# 🌞 Day Phase

You don’t move around the city during the day. You can:

* **Buy stuff** at the store
* **Drink with another farang** at the hotel

**Examples of items:**

* 🍺 **Beer** — drunkenness +1
* ☕ **Coffee** — drunkenness -1
* 🧴 **Condoms** — used during sex. If you don’t have one (or it breaks), draw a *Disease* card.
* 🌿 **Weed** — from a ganja shop, drunkenness +2

You’ve only got **three inventory slots**, so plan your vices wisely.

**Drinking with a farang** adds +2 drunkenness and gives you a random *“Farang Tip”* card.  
Could be:

* “Keep your money in the safe” — hookers won’t rob you overnight
* “Say *Mai mi tang* (no money)” — scares off beggars and street peddlers
* A hint that unlocks a secret location on the map
* Or sometimes just “You got absolutely wasted with him” — drunkenness +4 instead



# 🌚 Night Phase

Now the fun begins. Roll a die and move 1–4 spaces. You get 3–4 moves per night.

When you land somewhere, draw a card from that location’s deck — that’s your **event**.

Each event has up to **three outcomes**, depending on your **dice roll + drunkenness level**.

Low drunkenness = safer, more boring results.  
High drunkenness = chaos, bad decisions, better stories.

You’ll collect **positive and negative memory cards** with point values (+3, -1, etc.).  
At the end, whoever has the most good memories wins — or at least feels like they did.



# 🏪 Types of Locations

**1. Stores / Ganja Shops**  
Same as daytime — buy items, get drunker, make bad investments.



**2. Random Events**

A few examples:

* 💸 *You find 1000 baht on the street.* (+1000 baht)
* 🇮🇳 *An Indian guy stops you and starts talking nonsense.*
   * 1–3 → You nod politely and walk off, annoyed. *(Negative memory -1)*
   * 4–6 → You end up doing shots together; turns out he’s actually interesting. *(Draw a Farang Tip card)*
   * 7–9 → Next thing you know, you’re in some random hotel room watching your new friend and his buddies tag-team a hooker. You think it’s hilarious. *(Skip a turn, +4 memory)*
* 🚕 *Taxi driver offers you some white powder.*
   * 1–5 → You refuse, but cops stop you anyway. The driver’s clearly working with them. You’re clean though. *(Good memory +3)*
   * 6–9 → You accept, get searched, and boom — busted. Pay 5000 baht. *(Negative memory -7)*
* 💋 *A drunk female figure staggers toward you on a dark street.*
   * Have the “Mai mi tang” card? You shoo her away.
   * Don’t have it? She’s the scariest hooker you’ve ever seen and won’t leave for 5 minutes. *(Negative memory -1)*



**3. Secret Places**  
Unlocked through Farang Tip cards.  
No negative outcomes here — just pure chaos and joy.  
Examples: full-nude go-go bar, gentlemen’s club, ping-pong show, etc.



**4. Prostitutes**

You draw 1–3 **girl cards** (depending on where you are).  
Each has:

* a name
* a photo
* a funny short description
* positive & negative memory values

The “date” has two parts:

* **Part 1:** Street encounter (things like “you grab her crotch and discover a surprise”)
* **Part 2:** Hotel encounter (maybe she leaves early and takes your money)

If you didn’t use a condom — or it broke — draw a *Disease* card.



# 💀 Disease Cards

When you get one, don’t open it yet.  
Reveal them only at the end — because not every risky night leads to disaster.

Roughly 1/3 contain actual STDs with negative memories.  
The other 2/3 just say:

* “Phew, got lucky.”
* “God spared your sorry ass.”



# 🍻 Character Modifiers

At the start, each player can take a modifier card, like:

* **Alcoholic** — max drunkenness +6
* **Ladyboy Enthusiast** — surprise dicks don’t count as negative memories



# 🤝 Player Interactions

Still cooking this one up — maybe if two players land on the same tile, they draw from a special “Interaction Deck” and roll to see what kind of farang nonsense happens next.



# 🧩 Digital Version Additions (coming later)

Planning to expand the mechanics with:

* Taxis
* Fights
* Massage parlors
* Street food, scams, expat side quests



# 🃏 Hooker Cards

The girls’ cards will be styled like **ThaiFriendly profiles** — photo, name, short blurb, and random hilarious details.



# 🎯 The Goal

Officially: score the most *good memories*.  
But realistically: **have fun laughing at the insane situations** you end up in.

If you’ve actually been to Pattaya, you’ll probably relive half of your past nights.  
And for newbies — it’s basically a **survival guide disguised as comedy**, showing the unspoken rules of nightlife, bar bells, and classic scams.

If you’ve got your own **Pattaya horror stories**, drop them below — might turn them into event cards in the next version.

1o9du42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1o9du42/categorize_expense_helps_longterm_saving/,Categorize Expense Helps Long-Term Saving,"This is just a post about long-term saving plans and habits, welcome to discuss and add more ideas.

I've been having ups and downs in my career, the the saving habit I have helps me navigate through the difficult times and manage uncertainties when I was laid off last year--especially when I ran out of unemployment benefit (so normal to take 6+ months to land on a job these days), my savings still enable me to maintain same quality of life for about 15 months (if I chose to be more frugal, probably 2.5 years)

My background (so my saving habit may not be 100% applicable to everyone but can be a reference): male, no kids/house, graduated from college for couple years, do go to gym and drink coffee (monthly expense), based in the East Coast (things are more expensive here)

How I save: 1. categorize my expenses and set spending target each month; 2. use an app to track spendings in a daily basis; 3. have a spending goal and milestone; 4. mindset: invest in something that cost more up front but can last long to decrease cost per usage

1. Categorization: main categories are rent (fixed, including utility & internet), grocery (varies each month), commute (varies: gas, subway, etc.), social/dine out (this is the biggest part we can adjust), gym (fixed), phone plan (fixed), and miscellaneous;
2. Tracking: there are so many apps in the app store. The one I use breaks down spendings into a list and makes a pie chart to show which categories account for larger portion, so I can monitor it (spend less on this in the rest of the month)
3. Spending goal: I break down each month into 3 parts with an estimated total budget. For example, if I spend too much during the 2nd part (10th-20th), I will be more cautious in spending on restaurants during the 3rd part. I feel rewarded when I exceed my goal (spend less) and sometimes reward myself with a small extra spending at the end of the month
4. Long-term investment: some items, such as appliances, do cost more in the beginning but also last long and definitely worth it. For example, I love drinking expresso and a cup of latte costs about $5 on average. I bought a beginner level espresso machine for $250 in a Black Friday, which decreased my cost per latte (make it at home) to just $1 (beans, milk), so $4 savings per cup. I drink about 5 cups per week ($20 savings), so it only took 4-5 months to breakeven. Guess what, the machine still works fine after 2 years.

So reaching my savings goal make me feel so safe in this bad economy. I'd love to hear more ideas about how to manage our income/budgets.

I'm a college student, buy an entry grade machine for myself because I want and enjoy making coffee. Absolute newbie by the way.

So, it's quite long story to explain in detail. The first time I upgraded my portafilter into Bottomless one, it is universal version from another domestic brand which featured 14g basket. I used Medium-Dark beans and 1 grind size (which of course I lab it and it spray most less 2 and 0 is too much) which... came out also too fast like 60ml within 10 seconds (I make iced americano that's why 60ml) It sprays as micro foam to the side just a little.

I recently bought myself a proper 18g basket and changed the beans to medium roast. The result is fascinating, despite the machine lack of temperature and pressure control, the extract is much slower and 36ml around 25-30 seconds as how it should be.  BUT the problem is it's a total disaster like a diarrhea explosion on like first 3 seconds of extraction, even worse than before basket and beans change as its no longer sprayed in foam it's also spray liquid; I tried changing grind size and the answer is probably still the same as in 1 because it's the one that spray less compared to other size I've tried. It just so closes to good extraction. So, I just wanna make sure if it's a good grind size because I don't wanna jump up or down too high in size or maybe it just simply because I don't have a distribution tool like Macaron Tamper? I have WDT tool by the way. All of the stuff was great, aroma flavor color and crema, just the spray stuff that still happening.

Also, additional question. Is it okay the use something like Chopstick to poke and turn extracted puck into crumble and pour it out? Most of time I work on projects for whole night and the sound of hitting my portafilter against the knock box is... let's say not so pleasant to other room at like 3am. I never saw other people removed the extracted puck the other way around so I wonder if it would ruin the basket somehow.

Imagine a creami container that was half height, so that when you ran the “Top only” setting on the Ninja Deluxe, it would blend the 12oz container. It would have a plastic spacer that you would connect to the pint so it would lock properly into the machine. Advantages include;

1.) Being able to prep twice the amount of flavors without having to buy a dedicated freezer for your creami addiction.

2.) Texture comes out significantly better blending a full pint compared to half full, the empty space allows the ice cream to fly around rather than being forced in the mix.

3.) Blending the bottom half of a deluxe pint takes FOREVER.

4.) Faster freezing time, faster thawing time if needed

Major con; if you didn’t have your coffee in the morning and you hit full blend on a half pint without realizing it, that would probably not go well, although I’m sure the machine has some failsafes when trying to blend someone it can’t.

I had a traumatic birth after that milk was not coming in for days. Baby would want to feed constantly but didn’t have enough, I cried 2 weeks straight postpartum, couldn’t shower literally no time for anything. After the switch to formula everything changed. I actually enjoy being a mom. I’m enjoying time with my baby. My house is clean. I’m eating home cooked meals. I also get the chance to do things for myself like go for a coffee alone whilst hubby gives baby a bottle. It’s really great. But the other day whilst I was out my FIL (over the phone) asked my hubby if we EFF. When he said yes he was like: “Oh well if you are able to give baby a bottle then she should think about going back to work. “ For context - I am 2 months PP and also financially stable like even the apartment we live in belongs to me and is in my name. It’s not like I bring nothing to the table? But besides that I was offended. As if being the boob fountain is the only reason women take maternity leave? As if my baby doesn’t need me there for anything else? 

My husband told me, but he was obviously supportive of me and said to go back when I am ready to. But again today on the phone, my FIL actually told me: “You should start thinking about it” And I don’t know if it was a joke (we weren’t laughing neither was he) but when my husband said for him to relax and not put pressure on me he said like: “Well you could work from Feb. Febuary 1st. “

I am kind of obsessively thinking about what he said. I literally am still not healed fully from my birth & just as I’m starting to really enjoy the days with my baby - he has to mention going back to work. But somehow if I was breastfeeding my time off work would be valid? Again - is a boob full of milk all that we offer to our babies? The whole thing feels a bit condescending really.. And combined with what I went through to bring my beautiful baby to this earth and the fact we aren’t short for money.. I feel as if I am being viewed as not as valuable to my child because: “Oh she formula feeds - well she can be gone for hours a day who cares”. I feel a bit upset.

Completely fine when not flaring. Flares can happen for days or weeks, but I can go for months without a flare.

1o9ddic,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o9ddic/the_first_ever_real_persons_parade/,The First Ever Real Persons' Parade,"I wandered down to the ""First Ever Real Persons' Parade!"" today. 

And yes. Yes I learned so... Much. 

And yes, I'm still here, in the bathroom. Still me, still real. I promise.

But, for clarity, let me explain:

I made coffee first thing, as always, and stood at the kitchen window. Like I tend to do. The low bluegray predawn glass, cold and still. A muted saffron skyline. 

And then, immediately, out there over the sawtooth slopes of neighborhood rooftops, simply jogging along, there he was: 

An ordinary man of ordinary build (if not a bit narrow in the shoulders, being completely fair). He wore a red sweater and baby-blue running shorts. And everything was so normal, so unremarkable about him, save for his face.

His face:

Sheet-white and round, perfectly round--like a porcelain dinner plate--and on this flat, perfectly round and sheet-white face were the features, features you might expect on any face, 

Only all wrong. 

It was as though someone had splotched on the eyes--those great striking blue eyes--like a drunken sculptor, smearing the cherry red lips into a perpetual shout. No hint of a recognizeable emotion in the floundering wide O the mouth was making, and the longer I watched, the less it seemed to change. The face was, above all, without depth or shape.

The jogger had a two dimensional face.

I watched him, frozen. Breathless. He was barely out of view when a couple came strolling into view down the same sidewalk, heading the same direction.  To my horror, their faces were just as flat. Missing noses. Giant painted-on eyes of woad, terrible screaming mouths. 

But there was clearly esprit in their gait. Wherever they were going, they were on a mission.

I decided to throw on my coat and head downstairs. 

To follow them.

Out the door. A burst of sweet morning chill, the little glittering songs of chickadees in frostbit hedges. Cloying drafts of diesel fumes off scant early traffic. When I round the corner, there's a small crowd gathered. All their faces flat and round and made of porcelain. They've lined the sidewalks; I had the feeling they were waiting for something to begin. They waited in silence. No one spoke. 

Then came the floats. Or what should have been floats:

Enormous white gloves. Like the gloves of early cartoon animals--all balloony and wrong. They came sulking out of a thick fog suddenly draped like a curtain over the south end of the city. Between two of these hulking giants, lumbering along on their balloony digits, was strung a banner. In huge block letters, it read

THE FIRST ANNUAL REAL PEOPLES' PARADE!

I turned. Glared wildly about for someone who was actually real, real like me.

Finally I located an old man at the bus stop on the corner. A face of browned leather, chiseled, forged over brow and valley. My kind of human. 

I ran to him.

""Do you see this lunacy?"" I cried, waving wildly at the general viscinity of the scene. ""What the hell IS all this?""

He just sort of shrugged and watched. Now there were things, what appeared to be great lumbering corgis made out of something like cottage cheese. The flat-faced people were riding atop their curdled humps, wearing the bold little uniforms and fez caps of the Shriners. The giant corgis left thick white skids in the street as the strode by. 

""I think it's nice,"" said the old man. ""You don't think it's nice?""

""It's the most awful thing,"" I murmured.

""But aren't you one of... Aren't you like... Aren't you with them?"" 

I stared at the old man. That deep concern in his dark hazel gaze...

I rushed immediately back up to my apartment. Stood in front of the medicine cabinet. And I was going to look in the mirror.

I REALLY AM going to look in the mirror. I'm here now, in the sallow linoleum safety of the bathroom, and I'm going to prove to myself any second now that I'm real. That I'm not one of porcelain people, that they're an abomination and I am most definitely real.

Or I can stand here forever. Because there must be a space, a safe and silvered lining between that which we call REAL and FAKE. An interstitial state, homeostatic stillness. 

If I never see, it won't ever be. I'll just... Stand.

Not waiting. Just...

After this amount of time, I start to get the chimney spit, and of course, a meager shot.  
I've had the same setup, coffee, grinder, etc. going on 3+ years with the 9bar, and typically draw one shot almost every day. I typically break it down and clean it, dry, and store *assembled*. 

I am wondering if being stored assembled (screwed on, but not tight at all) might be causing the wear?   
Maybe it's making contact enough to deform the o-ring?   
I am not sure if there is any way to rejuvenate them either (doubtful)?

I decided today to start storing it in pieces after replacing my 3rd ring since May 2025, but wondered if anyone else has this kind of issue, short o-ring lifespan?

I've used spares from 9bar and also bought a 10-pack from [McMaster-Carr,](https://www.mcmaster.com/order-history/order/682b36081f17813d7c311895/) and don't see much difference between them longevity-wise.

Tiff was Autumn’s mother. Autumn was Tiff’s daughter. For years both of them had kept it secret. Not even Randall, who'd been here for both of their employments, had known. The revelation made me gasp, stumble back, sink down in horror against the freight trailer wall.

But first.

Before we get into the details of everything that came next, we need to do something else.

Let’s pause.

There are some things I should tell you about Tiff. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

She was a good mother.

That’s what *she* liked to think, at least. Her husband’s idea of her often came out in slightly varied wording: *lazy, distant, stubborn, selfish.*

Tiff didn’t mind much. She’d known from the start not to trust his opinion. You couldn’t trust somebody dumb enough to get his girlfriend pregnant in high school, after all. He wasn’t Tiff’s first choice of a husband (or even tenth), but that’s just how teen pregnancies worked back then, especially in small towns. You didn’t just get stuck with one child. You got stuck with two.

Marriage, however, was where gender conventions ended. Tiff was never one of those doting wives with dinner steaming on the stove at six and a duster as a permanent extension of her arm. She was the one who worked. Her *husband* was in charge of the baby―but mainly the booze. He took his responsibility very seriously. The second one, that was. 

Tiff was rarely home. She drove most weekdays, most weekends too. Trucking was the easiest job for somebody who’d never finished high school and had an entire family to support.

*She wants you*, her husband would tell her. *Men aren’t meant to care for infants like women are.*

*They aren’t,* she would agree. *They’re meant to work.*

He disliked that answer.

When she caught sight of an advert for a Route 333 position, she applied. The job was close to home. It was no difficult decision to go in for an interview. When she was offered a spot and informed of the pay, it was even *less* difficult of a decision to accept it.

 After two years of struggling to both visit her daughter and make ends meet, Tiff could finally switch to a mainly normal work week. Sure, she was gone most week nights, but on the weekends, she took her daughter to the movies. She pushed her on the swing and tucked her into bed. She wrapped bandages around scrapes and bruises.

There were downsides.

This new route was no normal route, to say the least. It didn’t take long to notice the oddities. She did obey the rules. She stayed away from anything suspicious or dangerous, but even so, sometimes dangerous things found her.

During one such occasion, every window and door in the gas station disappeared into flat smooth wall. Every employee turned on her, with teeth and claws and animal eyes. She killed them all with a crowbar, then smashed her way through the concrete wall with a sledgehammer over the course of hours.

*Leave,* she told her husband the next day. *You’re no longer welcome here.*

What was he compared to the gas station? He was lint flicked from a sleeve.

Years passed. The road lengthened. It populated with sedans and SUVs. When her daughter asked her what she did, Tiff would give her vagaries. Trucking. Hauling. Transportation. Boring work.

 Her daughter was young. She never pressed.

Tiff watched her friends lane-lock. Some gave up and settled, faded away in memory. Others kept driving. Often they were killed. Her time was coming too. Her rate of expansion was quicker than other drivers, and without her husband sucking away money, she no longer needed this job like she once had. 

Tiff noticed the signs. Stars flickering. Sudden expansion. Management tried to persuade her to stay oddly enough, even after she pointed out the clues from the handbook. Perhaps they didn't fully understand her plight?

She quit.

For years after, life was calm. She took a local position at a diner. She used her substantial savings to raise her daughter.

As Autumn grew, she struggled. Tiff never knew how to help. Teachers would say sit and Autumn would jump on her desk. She got into fights in high school. She lashed out at authority figures. 

Autumn had always been a bright girl―all parents believed so about their children, but Tiff knew this for a certainty. For a month, Tiff forced her to stay home and study for the ACTs. They fought. Autumn despised sitting still, but in the end, it was worth it. Her scores overshadowed her grades, and by the final bell of senior year, multiple universities had accepted Autumn.

*She won’t end up like me,* Tiff let herself believe.

And then Autumn did.

She dropped out of college. Tiff argued with her. Their arguments often escalated to screaming matches over the phone. It changed nothing.

*Try trade schools*, Tiff encouraged. People could still make a solid living with trades.

Autumn did. She tried a dozen. She really did try―Tiff believed her―but even so, she left them all within weeks. Eventually, in her search, she found a job at a nearby company doing what her mother had used to do. A position on Route 333.

*Don’t,* Tiff begged.

*It’s my decision.*

And it was.

Tiff gave her tips. She timed each of her daughter's drives. Autumn was new. She shouldn't have to worry about lane-locking yet, but even so, Tiff pestered her for any hint that it might be fast-approaching.

Sometimes, you can do everything right as a parent, and terrible things still happen. 

Something terrible did.

The worst part was the lack of closure. There was no police at Tiff’s doorstep or phone call from the company. How had they handled the disappearances in Tiff’s day? Surely not like this. There was no singular moment in which she realized her daughter wouldn’t be returning. There was only a sickening, dawning realization over the course of days: *she should have arrived home by now, shouldn’t she?* And a few days later: *perhaps she’s still coming.* And eventually: *it’s over.*

Had it been lane-locking? The Faceless Man? Had a gas station gone deadly like it had done to Tiff over a decade ago?

Her ex-husband called. Tiff told him nothing. He was suspicious. He deserved to be.

For one terrible week, even worse than that week in high school when a second line had appeared on a pregnancy test, Tiff did nothing. She didn’t mourn. Her daughter might live to ninety―what right did she have to mourn? For one week, she simply existed.

The next week she went in for an interview.

It wasn’t hard to fool them. They never would have hired her had they known how close she was to lane-locking or her true reason for applying, so she never told them. In the interview, she lied. Said she’d made it to the turnaround point when she hadn't. For someone like her, it was much too far to meet the minimum requirement. When they asked her to describe what the first weigh station looked like, she did. After all, things on Route 333 rarely changed.

Before, Tiff had worked under her married name, Autumn’s last name. Now, she worked under her maiden name. She claimed her daughter had died from cancer. No one knew. No one needed to. When she was young, she’d been taught to tell the truth, to do right. As she grew, it all became so much more confusing what exactly that right thing was, a million strings tangled together in an untangleable clump. The more you tugged, the tighter they knotted.

Not anymore. For once, the correct thing was clear.

It took three months to find her, three months of hauling and gossiping with the other drivers and searching. It was so much more complicated than merely contacting her over radio, but in the end, Tiff found her in person parked on the side of the road and napping on the hood of her truck. Her daughter was alive.

But she was *far.*

Autumn screamed. Her mother could do nothing to help her. She’d only put herself in danger, made everything worse.

*I can drive with you,* Tiff offered. *Spend the years at your side.*

Autumn threw her handheld radio. It exploded against the pavement. The only thing she wanted Tiff to do was leave while she could; the easiest way to make a problem worse was to inflict your same problem on another person. Tiff respected her wishes. She left Route 333 for the final time.

*Tried*.

On the way out, she lane-locked.

For years, Tiff’s daughter refused to speak with her. Autumn had always been one to explode with emotion, but this new grudge was a different thing entirely. Cold, immovable, simmering.

Occasionally, they would speak though, when they were sure no other haulers would be listening. The anger was always there, even justified. *Before*, Autumn had merely ruined her own life. Now, she'd ruined two.

Eventually, Autumn went silent. Tiff settled down. She scavenged a life of sorts. She waited, because one day, perhaps in thirty years, perhaps in forty, she knew her aged daughter would pull up to her diner, smile a wrinkled smile, and order a meal. Tiff would make it for her.

Tiff hadn't wanted her daughter those many years ago, but now that she had her, she shuddered to imagine the cold, empty existence she might have inhabited instead. Their stories had melded and become one, like mother like daughter, separated for a time, but always destined to join back up.

One day.

Eventually.

And then. She’d met a boy, a kind one with hurt behind his eyes. He'd reminded her of Autumn. She’d trusted him.

The boy had ruined everything.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For a long time after Tiff finished her story, Randall and I said nothing.

What did you say to that? A life’s story of love and hope, thrown raw at your feet, ending in a tragedy that was *your* fault. Tiff had only ever cared about one thing, and I’d taken her as far from that one thing as she could get. Not just that but I’d made sure that person lost their one true chance at escaping.

“Where are you going?” Randall asked me.

“Your office.”

“You’re just leaving? After all that?”

“I’m grabbing a set of keys to a truck with a windshield. This isn’t finished.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In case you all haven't noticed, I tend to recklessly hurtle into things headfirst without a great plan. In case you *also* haven't noticed, that course of action doesn't always lead to the most, shall we say, *error free* of results.

You'll be pleased to hear that for the first time in my employment on Route 333, I allowed myself one tiny detour. I popped over to my apartment and grabbed a thing or two. Only *then* did I recklessly hurtle back into things without a great plan.

When I passed through the redwoods, the forest-dwellers clawed at the back of my skull. I pushed them aside. They would never bother me again.

I drove through the blackness, through mist and rain. When I finally reached my destination, the morning sun was gleaming blindingly above the horizon.

Autumn wasn’t difficult to find. She was at her favorite diner, working her way through a plate of sausages and eggs. I’d never considered it before―how much time she spent here. How quickly she’d gravitated to this place in the short span since she’d taken up residence in this town, almost like she'd grown up hanging out in diners just like this one.

She watched as I approached. “So,” she said.

“So.”

“You’re back.”

“Seems so.”

She sighed and gestured at the empty bench across from her. “If we must.”

“Actually, I was hoping, well, maybe we could go on a walk? There’s something I wanted to talk about.”

She shrugged.

“I’ll get us coffee.”

I went to the back and made it in two portable styrofoam cups. The workers eyed me suspiciously. None of them grew fangs or horns though, so we'll take what wins we can. 

The first thing Autumn did when we started walking was spew the caffeinated liquid onto the sidewalk. “I swear this stuff gets worse the longer I'm here. What I wouldn’t give for a decent cup of Joe. It’s all so―” She made a face but chugged down another gulp “―disgusting.”

I snorted and took my own sip. For a bit we were silent.

“Look, Brendon,” Autumn started. “About earlier―”

“You don’t have to apologize. It was my fault.”

“But it wasn’t. I explode. That’s what I do, but that doesn't mean any of this was up to you. Really. You didn’t even have a reason for helping me, but you were trying anyway. The thing with the hitchhiker, well, you couldn’t have known. And it was both of our plans, not just yours.”

We crossed a bridge. I nodded.

“So did you get them out?” she asked.

“Chris and Al, yeah. Tiff wanted to stay, so I left her for now.”

Beside me, she tensed.

“Randall knows the truth too now. He’s good at keeping secrets. If anybody else lane-locks, he can get them out. I’m not needed anymore.”

“Of course, they need you.”

“I’m not saying that in a self-pitying way. The truth is it’s, well, *relieving*. If this was all up to me, nobody would keep helping people after I quit. It’s bigger than us now―that’s the thing I wanted to talk to you about, actually. I’ve decided something.” I took a breath. “I’m going with you.”

Her face opened in blatant surprise. We both paused at the crest of the bridge. Glowing shapes lurked in the water below, pulsing to the beat of the heartbeat in my neck.

“What do you mean?” Autumn prompted.

“I’m going to drive home with you for as many years as it takes. We’ll go in my rig. You don’t have to be alone.”

“Why would you do that?”

I swallowed. “Can we sit down?” I led us to a bench, faced her, reached for her hand, then withdrew. “Autumn―I’m in love with you.”

“Brendon…”

“No. Just listen. I know we barely know each other, but for years, I’ve struggled to connect with anybody, literally *anybody*. Even with my ex. With you, I don’t know. It’s different.” Sweat slid down my back. “You’re the first person I can actually talk with. I know this is out of nowhere, and maybe you don’t feel the same, but I think you might.”

For the flash of a shooting star, I saw it. Her eyes. They flickered with hope. After years of solitude and silence, of fear in the night and constant traveling, always traveling, always alone―she might not have to be. She could have a companion. She could have a *life.*

The light in her eyes dimmed.

“Brendon, I don’t…”

“Come with me. *Please*.”

“You don’t know me. You really don’t. Even if you did, even if you really loved me, I would never make somebody like you stuck with someone like me. That isn’t fair.”

“I *want* to.”

She raised her chin. “But *I* don’t want you to.”

“*Autumn*.” I reached for her hand, but this time she was the one to pull it back.

“Please,” I said. “Come with me. I love you.”

“You don’t.” She looked away. “I won’t.”

“But―”

“No!” She jerked back from me. The familiar anger bubbled up, preparing to erupt. “You can’t make me. I’m staying. I―I―” Her eyes unfocused. Her chin dipped. “I don't want…”

Her head drooped, but she shook herself back alert. “What’s going on? I can barely…”

I waited as her head continued to bob. Three times she jerked herself awake. On the fourth, her eyes slid closed, and her body slumped towards me. I eased her down onto the bench.

“Autumn? You there?”

No response.

I slid my arms under her legs and back, carried her back across the bridge, and settled her on the freight truck sleeper.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With Tiff I’d been confident things would work out: trick her into my trailer, lock her, and drive happily into the sunset. With Autumn, I’d been less sure. 

Would my ruse be enough to make her count as cargo? Did it matter *why* she was unwilling to go with me? How long would the effects last? 

I couldn’t risk merely locking her in the back like the others. She would have realized what I was doing, and accepted it during our drive. Instead, I needed one intense moment of unwillingness and to put her asleep for the rest of it; as long as she wasn’t aware what was going on, she couldn’t change her opinion.

That’s what I was banking on, at least.

I had to go quick. I’d slipped her a double dose of my sleep meds (no, I won’t tell you which. Somebody stupid will try this themselves), but I couldn’t be sure how long they would last. The drive would be at least ten hours, and that was assuming this whole unhinged plan even worked.

It did.

Within half an hour I was passing familiar scenery. The relief I’d expected to feel with Tiff arrived at last. It had worked. Autumn would get to leave. They all would. I hadn't ruined anything at all. I could still fix everything.

The relief was short-lived.

Getting Tiff out had already been impossible. We were so much further now. The chances of survival were infinitely smaller. Who knew what would claw themselves after us?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Apparently nothing.

It was eerie. For hours I waited for the chair to tip, the bucket to spill, the boot to fall…

It never did.

There was no highway patrol. No meat storm. No retaliation whatsoever. I simply drove. When I needed diesel, I filled up. 

I drove some more.

We passed deserted malls and familiar ghost towns. After hours, we passed Tiff’s diner―just a diner now, I suppose. Not even the Faceless Man waved from the parking lot. The entire highway was simply… *empty.* 

Had it given up? It knew it couldn’t stop me from trying unless it killed me and, unwilling to do so, it had simply resigned itself to lose. The thought was a comforting one, a reassurance to my racing mind.

Even if it wasn’t true. 

It couldn’t be. Route 333 wasn’t alive, not exactly. It couldn’t change its personality the way humans could. Something else was going on.

Eventually, I learned what.

Less than an hour from dispatch, I pulled my rig to a stop in the middle of the forest section. Towering trees shivered above me. Sagging clouds rolled across the sun, and the chirp of crickets rose from every direction conceivable as if they were sitting in the trees, watching me. 

I had fuel. We were so close now. The smart thing would be to keep driving, except for the teeny tiny detail that I couldn’t.

There was no road to drive on.

In front of us, the highway I’d learned to recognize from my last few months, disappeared. It cut off in a sheer line, replaced by an unfolding of impenetrable trees.

Route 333 didn't need to kill us to keep us here.

This new route was no normal route, to say the least. It didn’t take long to notice the oddities. She did obey the rules. She stayed away from anything suspicious or dangerous, but even so, sometimes dangerous things found her.

During one such occasion, every window and door in the gas station disappeared into flat smooth wall. Every employee turned on her, with teeth and claws and animal eyes. She killed them all with a crowbar, then smashed her way through the concrete wall with a sledgehammer over the course of hours.

*Leave,* she told her husband the next day. *You’re no longer welcome here.*

What was he compared to the gas station? He was lint flicked from a sleeve.

Years passed. The road lengthened. It populated with sedans and SUVs. When her daughter asked her what she did, Tiff would give her vagaries. Trucking. Hauling. Transportation. Boring work.

 Her daughter was young. She never pressed.

Tiff watched her friends lane-lock. Some gave up and settled, faded away in memory. Others kept driving. Often they were killed. Her time was coming too. Her rate of expansion was quicker than other drivers, and without her husband sucking away money, she no longer needed this job like she once had. 

Tiff noticed the signs. Stars flickering. Sudden expansion. Management tried to persuade her to stay oddly enough, even after she pointed out the clues from the handbook. Perhaps they didn't fully understand her plight?

She quit.

For years after, life was calm. She took a local position at a diner. She used her substantial savings to raise her daughter.

As Autumn grew, she struggled. Tiff never knew how to help. Teachers would say sit and Autumn would jump on her desk. She got into fights in high school. She lashed out at authority figures. 

Autumn had always been a bright girl―all parents believed so about their children, but Tiff knew this for a certainty. For a month, Tiff forced her to stay home and study for the ACTs. They fought. Autumn despised sitting still, but in the end, it was worth it. Her scores overshadowed her grades, and by the final bell of senior year, multiple universities had accepted Autumn.

*She won’t end up like me,* Tiff let herself believe.

And then Autumn did.

She dropped out of college. Tiff argued with her. Their arguments often escalated to screaming matches over the phone. It changed nothing.

*Try trade schools*, Tiff encouraged. People could still make a solid living with trades.

Autumn did. She tried a dozen. She really did try―Tiff believed her―but even so, she left them all within weeks. Eventually, in her search, she found a job at a nearby company doing what her mother had used to do. A position on Route 333.

*Don’t,* Tiff begged.

*It’s my decision.*

And it was.

Tiff gave her tips. She timed each of her daughter's drives. Autumn was new. She shouldn't have to worry about lane-locking yet, but even so, Tiff pestered her for any hint that it might be fast-approaching.

Sometimes, you can do everything right as a parent, and terrible things still happen. 

Something terrible did.

The worst part was the lack of closure. There was no police at Tiff’s doorstep or phone call from the company. How had they handled the disappearances in Tiff’s day? Surely not like this. There was no singular moment in which she realized her daughter wouldn’t be returning. There was only a sickening, dawning realization over the course of days: *she should have arrived home by now, shouldn’t she?* And a few days later: *perhaps she’s still coming.* And eventually: *it’s over.*

Had it been lane-locking? The Faceless Man? Had a gas station gone deadly like it had done to Tiff over a decade ago?

Her ex-husband called. Tiff told him nothing. He was suspicious. He deserved to be.

For one terrible week, even worse than that week in high school when a second line had appeared on a pregnancy test, Tiff did nothing. She didn’t mourn. Her daughter might live to ninety―what right did she have to mourn? For one week, she simply existed.

The next week she went in for an interview.

It wasn’t hard to fool them. They never would have hired her had they known how close she was to lane-locking or her true reason for applying, so she never told them. In the interview, she lied. Said she’d made it to the turnaround point when she hadn't. For someone like her, it was much too far to meet the minimum requirement. When they asked her to describe what the first weigh station looked like, she did. After all, things on Route 333 rarely changed.

Before, Tiff had worked under her married name, Autumn’s last name. Now, she worked under her maiden name. She claimed her daughter had died from cancer. No one knew. No one needed to. When she was young, she’d been taught to tell the truth, to do right. As she grew, it all became so much more confusing what exactly that right thing was, a million strings tangled together in an untangleable clump. The more you tugged, the tighter they knotted.

Not anymore. For once, the correct thing was clear.

It took three months to find her, three months of hauling and gossiping with the other drivers and searching. It was so much more complicated than merely contacting her over radio, but in the end, Tiff found her in person parked on the side of the road and napping on the hood of her truck. Her daughter was alive.

But she was *far.*

Autumn screamed. Her mother could do nothing to help her. She’d only put herself in danger, made everything worse.

*I can drive with you,* Tiff offered. *Spend the years at your side.*

Autumn threw her handheld radio. It exploded against the pavement. The only thing she wanted Tiff to do was leave while she could; the easiest way to make a problem worse was to inflict your same problem on another person. Tiff respected her wishes. She left Route 333 for the final time.

*Tried*.

On the way out, she lane-locked.

For years, Tiff’s daughter refused to speak with her. Autumn had always been one to explode with emotion, but this new grudge was a different thing entirely. Cold, immovable, simmering.

Occasionally, they would speak though, when they were sure no other haulers would be listening. The anger was always there, even justified. *Before*, Autumn had merely ruined her own life. Now, she'd ruined two.

Eventually, Autumn went silent. Tiff settled down. She scavenged a life of sorts. She waited, because one day, perhaps in thirty years, perhaps in forty, she knew her aged daughter would pull up to her diner, smile a wrinkled smile, and order a meal. Tiff would make it for her.

Tiff hadn't wanted her daughter those many years ago, but now that she had her, she shuddered to imagine the cold, empty existence she might have inhabited instead. Their stories had melded and become one, like mother like daughter, separated for a time, but always destined to join back up.

One day.

Eventually.

And then. She’d met a boy, a kind one with hurt behind his eyes. He'd reminded her of Autumn. She’d trusted him.

The boy had ruined everything.

For a long time after Tiff finished her story, Randall and I said nothing.

What did you say to that? A life’s story of love and hope, thrown raw at your feet, ending in a tragedy that was *your* fault. Tiff had only ever cared about one thing, and I’d taken her as far from that one thing as she could get. Not just that but I’d made sure that person lost their one true chance at escaping.

“Where are you going?” Randall asked me.

“Your office.”

“You’re just leaving? After all that?”

“I’m grabbing a set of keys to a truck with a windshield. This isn’t finished.”

In case you all haven't noticed, I tend to recklessly hurtle into things headfirst without a great plan. In case you *also* haven't noticed, that course of action doesn't always lead to the most, shall we say, *error free* of results.

You'll be pleased to hear that for the first time in my employment on Route 333, I allowed myself one tiny detour. I popped over to my apartment and grabbed a thing or two. Only *then* did I recklessly hurtle back into things without a great plan.

When I passed through the redwoods, the forest-dwellers clawed at the back of my skull. I pushed them aside. They would never bother me again.

I drove through the blackness, through mist and rain. When I finally reached my destination, the morning sun was gleaming blindingly above the horizon.

Autumn wasn’t difficult to find. She was at her favorite diner, working her way through a plate of sausages and eggs. I’d never considered it before―how much time she spent here. How quickly she’d gravitated to this place in the short span since she’d taken up residence in this town, almost like she'd grown up hanging out in diners just like this one.

She watched as I approached. “So,” she said.

“So.”

“You’re back.”

“Seems so.”

She sighed and gestured at the empty bench across from her. “If we must.”

“Actually, I was hoping, well, maybe we could go on a walk? There’s something I wanted to talk about.”

She shrugged.

“I’ll get us coffee.”

I went to the back and made it in two portable styrofoam cups. The workers eyed me suspiciously. None of them grew fangs or horns though, so we'll take what wins we can. 

The first thing Autumn did when we started walking was spew the caffeinated liquid onto the sidewalk. “I swear this stuff gets worse the longer I'm here. What I wouldn’t give for a decent cup of Joe. It’s all so―” She made a face but chugged down another gulp “―disgusting.”

I snorted and took my own sip. For a bit we were silent.

“Look, Brendon,” Autumn started. “About earlier―”

“You don’t have to apologize. It was my fault.”

“But it wasn’t. I explode. That’s what I do, but that doesn't mean any of this was up to you. Really. You didn’t even have a reason for helping me, but you were trying anyway. The thing with the hitchhiker, well, you couldn’t have known. And it was both of our plans, not just yours.”

We crossed a bridge. I nodded.

“So did you get them out?” she asked.

“Chris and Al, yeah. Tiff wanted to stay, so I left her for now.”

Beside me, she tensed.

“Randall knows the truth too now. He’s good at keeping secrets. If anybody else lane-locks, he can get them out. I’m not needed anymore.”

“Of course, they need you.”

“I’m not saying that in a self-pitying way. The truth is it’s, well, *relieving*. If this was all up to me, nobody would keep helping people after I quit. It’s bigger than us now―that’s the thing I wanted to talk to you about, actually. I’ve decided something.” I took a breath. “I’m going with you.”

Her face opened in blatant surprise. We both paused at the crest of the bridge. Glowing shapes lurked in the water below, pulsing to the beat of the heartbeat in my neck.

“What do you mean?” Autumn prompted.

“I’m going to drive home with you for as many years as it takes. We’ll go in my rig. You don’t have to be alone.”

“Why would you do that?”

I swallowed. “Can we sit down?” I led us to a bench, faced her, reached for her hand, then withdrew. “Autumn―I’m in love with you.”

“Brendon…”

“No. Just listen. I know we barely know each other, but for years, I’ve struggled to connect with anybody, literally *anybody*. Even with my ex. With you, I don’t know. It’s different.” Sweat slid down my back. “You’re the first person I can actually talk with. I know this is out of nowhere, and maybe you don’t feel the same, but I think you might.”

For the flash of a shooting star, I saw it. Her eyes. They flickered with hope. After years of solitude and silence, of fear in the night and constant traveling, always traveling, always alone―she might not have to be. She could have a companion. She could have a *life.*

The light in her eyes dimmed.

“Brendon, I don’t…”

“Come with me. *Please*.”

“You don’t know me. You really don’t. Even if you did, even if you really loved me, I would never make somebody like you stuck with someone like me. That isn’t fair.”

“I *want* to.”

She raised her chin. “But *I* don’t want you to.”

“*Autumn*.” I reached for her hand, but this time she was the one to pull it back.

“Please,” I said. “Come with me. I love you.”

“You don’t.” She looked away. “I won’t.”

“But―”

“No!” She jerked back from me. The familiar anger bubbled up, preparing to erupt. “You can’t make me. I’m staying. I―I―” Her eyes unfocused. Her chin dipped. “I don't want…”

Her head drooped, but she shook herself back alert. “What’s going on? I can barely…”

I waited as her head continued to bob. Three times she jerked herself awake. On the fourth, her eyes slid closed, and her body slumped towards me. I eased her down onto the bench.

“Autumn? You there?”

No response.

I slid my arms under her legs and back, carried her back across the bridge, and settled her on the freight truck sleeper.

With Tiff I’d been confident things would work out: trick her into my trailer, lock her, and drive happily into the sunset. With Autumn, I’d been less sure. 

Would my ruse be enough to make her count as cargo? Did it matter *why* she was unwilling to go with me? How long would the effects last? 

I couldn’t risk merely locking her in the back like the others. She would have realized what I was doing, and accepted it during our drive. Instead, I needed one intense moment of unwillingness and to put her asleep for the rest of it; as long as she wasn’t aware what was going on, she couldn’t change her opinion.

That’s what I was banking on, at least.

I had to go quick. I’d slipped her a double dose of my sleep meds (no, I won’t tell you which. Somebody stupid will try this themselves), but I couldn’t be sure how long they would last. The drive would be at least ten hours, and that was assuming this whole unhinged plan even worked.

It did.

Within half an hour I was passing familiar scenery. The relief I’d expected to feel with Tiff arrived at last. It had worked. Autumn would get to leave. They all would. I hadn't ruined anything at all. I could still fix everything.

The relief was short-lived.

Getting Tiff out had already been impossible. We were so much further now. The chances of survival were infinitely smaller. Who knew what would claw themselves after us?

Apparently nothing.

It was eerie. For hours I waited for the chair to tip, the bucket to spill, the boot to fall…

It never did.

There was no highway patrol. No meat storm. No retaliation whatsoever. I simply drove. When I needed diesel, I filled up. 

I drove some more.

We passed deserted malls and familiar ghost towns. After hours, we passed Tiff’s diner―just a diner now, I suppose. Not even the Faceless Man waved from the parking lot. The entire highway was simply… *empty.* 

Had it given up? It knew it couldn’t stop me from trying unless it killed me and, unwilling to do so, it had simply resigned itself to lose. The thought was a comforting one, a reassurance to my racing mind.

Even if it wasn’t true. 

It couldn’t be. Route 333 wasn’t alive, not exactly. It couldn’t change its personality the way humans could. Something else was going on.

Eventually, I learned what.

Less than an hour from dispatch, I pulled my rig to a stop in the middle of the forest section. Towering trees shivered above me. Sagging clouds rolled across the sun, and the chirp of crickets rose from every direction conceivable as if they were sitting in the trees, watching me. 

I had fuel. We were so close now. The smart thing would be to keep driving, except for the teeny tiny detail that I couldn’t.

There was no road to drive on.

In front of us, the highway I’d learned to recognize from my last few months, disappeared. It cut off in a sheer line, replaced by an unfolding of impenetrable trees.

Route 333 didn't need to kill us to keep us here.

It could [simply end](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)

It has recently come to my attention from some colleagues that people from the higher ups (whom I've also had the chance to work with a few times) think I give off the impression of a ""slacker with NO desire to work"".

I am aware that I don't really give off the best ""impression"" to people, that really goes for everything I have going on in life and I've made my peace with it long ago. I place the ""blame"" (though there's really nothing wrong with it) on my personality, I'm just built this way and that's the hill I'll die on.  
Moving on.

If I give off the impression of a ""slacker"" then I just don't get what the fuck the world is on about.  
  
First off I'm the first to show up at our workplace in the morning every single day.  
I never use my phone outside of lunch break, not even when we're driving somewhere for an hour and I have to sit there as a passenger.  
I don't smoke and I don't drink coffee so I don't even have these little vices that take up a few minutes every hour for the average worker.  
If it's a busy day and you decide that we can't afford to lunch break, I won't bat an eye and go with your plan.  
If for some reason you decide it's best for us the spend an unplanned amount of extra hours and stay at a construction site until 9pm, I won't bat an eye and go with your plan.  
If you need a tool, you ask me and I'll get it — the next time you happen to do the same task, I'll have it ready without you asking.  
If something's not clear, I'll ask about it. I'm hard-headed so I'll ask you the same thing multiple times — It doesn't mean I don't pay attention, I just CARE that much and I WANT it to stick with me because I think it's important info.  
If there's nothing to do, I'll pick up a broom and swipe the floor.  
If you've got your hands working on something, I'll have my eyes glued onto it because I'm an apprentice and my role is to learn and assist.  
In my years as an apprentice I've never openly complained about a single thing to my colleagues.  
I don't complain when work gets in the way of my personal life plans. I don't complain when a job gets too dirty. I don't complain when we're a team and the work load is uneven because other people spend their time smoking or on their phone at work hours. I don't complain when I walk non-stop for so long I literally can't feel my feet anymore. I don't complain when you put all the heavy lifting onto my back. I don't complain when you scold me for no reason because the day's getting stressing and you need to let that rage out on someone. I don't complain when you send me to do ""special"" tasks that are literally walking 30 mins back and forth just to pick up coffee for everyone instead of actually teaching me meaningful things.  
  
I pour my body and mind into my day job because I care about learning, I've made so many sacrifices from my personal life to accomodate my workplace needs because I CARE about the role and I CARE about learning. I took on an apprenticeship with dogshit pay because I CARE about learning and I WANT to learn the damn job.  
If I'm slow it's because I put health first and I try do things as properly as possible without putting too much strain on my body. I'm young and I care about my later years.

If you think I'm not entertaining enough for your likings just remember that you hired me as an apprentice, not a god damn circus monkey.

I'll never fucking understand how people put the same weight on impression as they do with work and tasks done. The effort is there. The mind is there. My body is there.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.,"I (F27, Brazilian) need to vent. I've been single for a year and I was in a 5-year relationship before that, so I’m still relearning how to date

Nothing clicked until I met this German guy (M34). I wasn’t expecting much, but has been some fun weeks so far. Or so I thought. At some point he mentioned that his last relationship ended partly because his ex was older and wanted kids so he thought dating younger would avoid that pressure.

I told him I wasn’t sure about kids either and that I wasn’t rushing to have a boyfriend. I don’t like dating multiple people at once, but I’m also quite individual and need my own time and space to find out what I wanted. He said he liked that I wasn’t putting pressure on him and that being with me felt effortless.

Last weekend, we had coffee, dinner and talked for hours. He got emotional about his dead mother and even cried a bit at the restaurant. Later, we slept together. It was intimate and tender. He even said *“You can’t get this kind of connection and exploration in a one-night stand.”*

So I thought things were going well. Then he called me this morning saying he’s feeling pressure **from himself**, not from me, but that he’s afraid he’ll hurt me because *“what if in three months I realize I don’t want a relationship.”* I was very sleepy as it was 8h, so I couldn't say much, I just told him I was just enjoying it one day at time. That maybe indeed eventually I'd want a relationship, but on the other hand I don't want one just to have one and that maybe in a month we would figured that there are things that are simply not compatible, but said it’s better to stop now so he doesn’t “waste my future time.”

Then he **blocked me on WhatsApp.** That felt strange because we never really texted much, and there was no fight or anything nor I message him. I didn’t understand why he’d shut the door so abruptly, and I acted from anxiety... I messaged him on Instagram saying I didn't understand if I did something wrong.

He replied saying he blocked me so he wouldn’t reach out again if he got emotional, because I “deserve closure.”

I told him I understood, but that it felt strange for him to assume I wanted a relationship and end things when I was simply leting myself feel. That I was aware I could get hurt, but that's just how live goes. He thanked me, wished me well, and that was it. Very cold, very weird.

Now I’m just… confused. He was kind, sweet, emotionally open — and then shut it all down overnight.

**Was I naive to think we could just enjoy things and see where they went?**  
**Do people really feel “pressure” even when no one’s asking for anything?**  
**And blocking on WhatsApp — why?** I deleted his number to avoid texting if I got emotional, but I wasn’t messaging or chasing him, so I don’t get it.",1,1760734851.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Up to that point, we had been texting very frequently, dating a couple of times a week, having very intimate and intense sex, having deep conversations into the late night, getting up the next day and continuing our deep conversations over coffee. She told me about past relationships, difficulties she had in life and trauma from her past. I thought we had a rapidly deepening emotional connection. I felt intense feelings for her, even possibly love, but was regulating as best I could.

But then I noticed her communication behavior changed. Her language became more vague. Texts were way more infrequent and shorter. I asked about it and she said everything was OK with her. So I moved on. Meanwhile, I had know that she was seeing someone else. She had described it as casual and I believed her. But she also stopped wanting to talk about her at a certain point, around the time the communication changed.

Eventually, during one of our late night deep conversations, I could tell that she was holding something big back. And I had suspected something had changed with the other guy she was dating. She confirmed that they were still together, and then I asked if she was in love with him. She said yes. But she was unhappy that I asked. And she was never really clear why other than vaguely referring to not feeling comfortable talking about that relationship.

From my perspective, I had never had growing feelings for someone, likely love for them, when they were in love with someone else. I also never would have chosen to be in a poly (love between more than one sexual partner) dynamic like that. Not at that time. And I felt/feel like I was sweep into a dynamic I didn't choose for myself. The whole experience has made me weary of poly specifically, although I'm fine with non-monogamy.

In my mind, I had to ask because I should know that kind of info to be properly informed. She claimed she was ""going to tell me"" as saying ""I love you"" to each other had happened within the week. But we had gone on a date, had sex and were deep into the night when I asked. Eventually, she would say that ""I should have known it could happen,"" meaning that I should have someone known that she either was or could be in love with the other guy. When she talked about poly, which she claimed she was still figuring out how she wanted to approach it, it was often in vague terms.

I felt like I did the right thing for myself and generally. I think what she did was wrong, or at least ethically and emotionally irresponsible. But I'm willing to listen if someone can explain why she might be justified, if that argument can even be made.",4,1760734785.0,polyamory,9,1.0,False

I like some metal but I've never really played it much... I threw my shit in drop d, dimed the distortion, dimed my double stack (in an apartment so actually 2.5 on my 15 watt combo), blew a few lines (took a few sips of coffee), and went to town. It's been a blast.

I know I'm decades late to the party here but it's a way more versatile pedal than I was expecting. I'm not sure how much of an ear I have for this stuff but I was able to get some really gritty old Mayhem sounding tones, some cool drone-y stuff, and then tighten things up a bit for a more modern (for lack of a better word) sound. I was 95% sure I'd just resell this but I'm not so sure I will now.

Every conversation made her anxious; every meeting felt like a test. No matter how often she brushed or used mouthwash, the bad breath kept coming back.

At first, she blamed coffee. Then she cut out onions, garlic, even dairy. But nothing worked. Her confidence took a hit — she’d lean away mid-sentence, afraid someone might notice.

Finally, out of sheer frustration, she searched online for a *“dentist near me”* and found[ Burute Dental](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) in PCMC. It wasn’t her first dental visit, but something about their reviews and focus on patient care made her decide to give it one last try.

During her consultation, the team didn’t just check her teeth — they asked questions no one else had before. They examined her gums, took a quick **digital X-ray**, and ran a **periodontal health assessment**. The result? The real culprit wasn’t her diet at all — it was **chronic gum infection** that had been quietly building beneath the surface.

The treatment plan was simple but life-changing: a deep **scaling and polishing**, followed by **gum therapy** to eliminate bacteria. Within days, the sour taste and odor disappeared. Within weeks, her gums looked healthier, her breath fresher, and her confidence finally restored.

She later admitted, “It wasn’t the mints that failed me — it was not knowing the real reason behind the problem.”

At **Burute Dental**, stories like hers are common — where small symptoms reveal deeper issues, and where genuine care makes all the difference. Because sometimes, the solution isn’t in a mint. It’s in meeting the right **dentist in PCMC** who knows how to find the cause, not just mask the effect.",1,1760734547.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

1o9cvwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o9cvwa/im_scared_that_my_ex_will_get_with_someone_new/,I'm scared that my ex will get with someone new quickly,"I am so sorry for the ridiculously long post! I don't know why I went into so much detail. Thank you in advance if you manage to read it all 💛.

So, I (39f) should preface this post by saying I broke up with him (38m). Not because I don't love him but because I had to finally admit that our lifestyle together was not working for anyone. 

He has his son (12) full time and, naturally, a lot of our decisions had to revolve around his son. For example, where he had to live due to his son's school meant that I had to leave my place and move in with him but that meant I had to live far away from my family (far away in UK standards - a 40 minute drive). Whilst I don't have bio children, I am a big influence in my nephews life (13) life and he relies on me a lot due to an unstable environment at his mothers. Before we moved in together, my ex committed to picking up and dropping my nephew every weekend until we could move a little closer to a bigger town that still ticked his boxes but was in a place with better public transport as I can't drive. I was hugely appreciative of him doing that but we never ended up moving (his son gets deeply affected by change and my ex was not the most proactive person or would agree to stuff immediately without fully thinking through stuff like his son probably not wanting to move but then realise it later when I start to make plans) and the weekly/fornightly drives were starting to become tiring on him.

One of the biggest issue for me was how his parents would come every week day to drop his son home after school. They'd regularly stay sometimes until my ex got home. I'm a huge introvert and struggle with social anxiety so every day it was like this looming thing hanging over my entire day. I also work from home so my home is also my place of work, it meant that my working day was always interrupted. What I found most frustrating about this is that his son wasn't being dropped off from school, he would get the bus to the bus stop next to his old house even though there is a bus stop that the school serves right opposite our house so it could have been something we changed to make my life happier but it never happened. He admitted that he felt guilty about basically telling his parents 'they weren't needed anymore' which I get to an extent but it's not like I was saying I didn't want them to ever come round. Infact, I pushed for swapping these daily drop offs for quality time with his parents like going for coffees or having them over for a film night but just less frequently and not during my work day. I came into this accepting that my needs would come behind his son, but I often felt like the last rung on the ladder, even behind his parents. For example, if I suggested something he could be dismissive but if his mother suggested the same thing he's be all for it. He definitely struggles with needing his mother's stamp of approval but I wasn't comfortable with another person having so much control over my life.

There were other issues too. He was adamant that he still wanted to be with me but we hadn't slept together for months and months. We were affectionate in other ways, but sexually, it was non existent. I felt like it was because he wasn't into me and that then affected my libido and so we were then both not initiating sex. He was so affectionate and loving in other ways though, regularly telling me how much he loved me. Kissing me. Holding me. And we get on very well, made each other laugh often etc. but things started to get tense the more unhappy I became. He also had a habit of getting super defensive whenever I'd bring something up then end up becoming incredibly self deprecating and apologetic. In the beginning, we'd been great at communicating and having raw, difficult conversations that brought us closer together. The last time we had a huge argument, it was the only time that he ever really shouted at me. I talked about breaking up and he was crying saying he didn't want us to end, etc. we decided to keep going but nothing really changed.

The last couple of months, his sons behaviour started getting worse. His son has some issues, although not diagnosed, (see previous statement about ex not being proactive) it's like OCD and a lot of anxiety. Amongst other things, he began having huge anxiety attacks and meltdowns about going to a weekend club that he used to happily go to. Then, he started saying he didn't want my nephew to come anymore. He said my nephew was unhygienic and messy, didn't wash his hands etc and it was disgusting him. He had the biggest meltdown I've ever heard when the weekend came around -hyperventilating, screaming, wailing, gritting his teeth, so we didn't end up going to get my nephew because I didn't want my ex to leave him with me in that state, I felt he needed his dad. 

Anyway, during a conversation we were having about how to manage this as my nephew stopping coming was not an option for either of us I just ended up being honest about how unhappy I was and that I thought it might be best that I moved out. He was very receptive to it (I think because it meant he didn't have to deal with this new issue his son was having) at first, he said well we don't need to break up if you move out, but I kinda gave the reality check that I don't know how it could work when we're struggling to make it work when we live together. And he seemed pretty much ok with it. Now, not that I wanted someone I love to be devastated or to try and convince me to stay as I know deep down this is the right decision but I was left kind of like oh...what changed in you? Now, I'm ok to lose but a couple months ago I wasn't. 

Basically, it stung my self esteem. 

At one point, he was telling me how stressed he was and listed stuff out, and then I said and we're going through a separation and in response he said 'well actually that's one of the more positive things,' and I was just like......ooookie doke then. 

I know I just need to concentrate on getting my life back, being close to my family again, etc but I, admittedly, have always struggled with low self esteem and I just can't shake this feeling that he'll get with someone new quite quickly. He has rarely been single, getting with someone new quickly after past relationships. He told me that he wasn't interested in anyone else and just wanted to focus on his son (which tbh he really needs to) and that our relationship was so good that he wouldn't be able to top it. But I'm not naive and that sounds like bullshit to me.

Anyway, I don't know why I'm saying all this or what I'm hoping to achieve. I guess just looking for support in some way. ",1,1760734332.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1o9ct2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1o9ct2d/the_flannel_phenomenon/,The Flannel Phenomenon,"For the past two years, I’ve worn the same work uniform every weekday, five days a week, without fail. Polo shirt, chino pants, and my black oxfords. It’s not flashy but it works. I show up, get it done, move on. I try not to keep my wardrobe too complicated because like the Steve Jobs, I believe in ego depletion, and if I spend my mornings deciding what to wear, that’s brainpower I’m not using where it really counts. Plus, it saves time. No standing around wondering what matches with what I just get dressed and go.

My wife says my style is a little too dull for my workplace, but I’ve read the employee manual and it clearly states that all employees must dress in accordance with their role. I’m not sure if that was meant to be taken literally, but as far as I can tell, my attire fits the guidelines just dully fine.

But this morning, I stepped out of bed and the air hit different. It wasn’t just “cool,” it was that first real taste of fall. The kind that makes your windows fog up and your coffee feel like a survival tool. You know the type where the morning sky’s still a little grey out, wind’s got a bite of frost to it, and suddenly your closet feels more like a toolbox than a runway.

So I reached past the usual polos and grabbed the red-and-black flannel hanging in the back of my closet. Buttoned it up, looked in the mirror, and thought, “That's warm and comfy.""

No game plan, no outfit inspirations, just sleeves and a bit of lumberjack energy.

Just as I was packing up for my commute, my wife, half-awake in the hallway, paused, did a double take, and asked, “That’s what you’re wearing today!?” I chuckled on my way out the door, explaining to her that it’s been colder than usual.

I arrived to work with time to spare but before I could even get to the coffee machine the comments started rolling in:

“You look nice today!”

“Hey, I really like your shirt.”

“What's with the shirt? You having lunch with someone today?”

Apparently, all it takes to become office famous is sleeves and a fresh new pattern. Before I knew it, everyone was asking for my opinion on reports, seeking my guidance on future projects. Somehow, the world flipped upside down and suddenly, I was on top.

I've now come to call this ""The Flannel Phenomenon."" Slip it on and boom, you’re not just cozy, you’re the one calling the shots. It's like one part Kevin Nguyen meme, one part executive vibes and somehow it works!

The craziest part is, I’m not reinventing myself here. I still believe in the Steve Job ideology of save the brainpower for bigger decisions. That's why my polo rotation still exists. Uniform over chaos. Function over flair.

But adding the flannel every now and then? It’s almost like a a cheat code. It’s the one time the outfit ""does"" the work for you. Cozy warm, 100% brain juice, and enough fall swagger for your manager to approve your PTO request.",1,1760734150.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

This story is about a day when I felt like a baby again—when my 5-year-old self finally said, “Yes, you are seen by someone.”

It was the 2nd of October. I took the day off from my main job because I was exhausted. I slept the whole day until I woke up at 4:57 PM.

Then, I felt sad—like I was drowning in myself, like I was just a worthless pile of nothing. Self-hatred weighed heavier on me than my own body. So, I took the day off from my other job too. No notifications to reply to. I wasn’t even in the mood to talk to myself.

Every heartbeat felt like a thousand-pound hammer pounding on my chest. Out of pure muscle memory, I opened the Reddit chats and replied to a message. Just the usual chit-chat, and then a question: “Why didn’t you go to the office?”

I wanted to open up, but I didn’t want to be a burden to someone who was already tired from their own day.

My reply was: “I just want to vanish from this face of the earth.”

I wanted to drown in my own blood, to feel my breath choke me. If you’ve read my other post about how my friend left me without any explanation, just because so much was going on in her life, you’d understand the weight of it. She just sent me one text and left, instead of telling me what was happening.

Then, she asked me to go out. I told her I couldn’t, that I was too broke to sit at a coffee shop. She offered to pay for my coffee, and I refused, but for the first time in my life, a stranger offered to pay for me. My heart sank, like a 5-year-old being offered chocolate while sitting alone on a patch of green grass.

“1000 rupees hain. Kya hi ho jayega. Number bhejo,” she said. I didn’t want to be seen as a “hungry guy,” which I am, deep down, when treated like a child by someone older than me.

Sharam khaatay huay or dheet ban k , I sent her my number. She transferred the money and asked me to tell her my ETA when I got home.

I put on my best outfit with tears in my eyes, washed my unwashed face, and headed to CBTL Johar Town. I got my double chocolate latte over ice.

I drank it with tears again—like someone had finally offered to play with me, when no one had ever wanted to see me standing on the sidelines, just because I wasn’t “good enough.”

Anyway, I went back home, and she sent me a huge box of fried rice. Being so far from home, it felt like home again—like someone was waiting for me.

The rider called and said, “Payment kar di hai bhejne walay ne.”

Tears were  in my eyes, pure happiness. It felt like someone was finally watching me, smiling from a distance while I played with toys.

I ate that entire box of fried rice with ketchup, my tears mixing with the salty taste of the food.

And then, I put on my earphone and played spotify , bangers over bangers and yeah after just being there in confusion I slept.

Mind you, she’s much older than me, and I always thought I was the one trying to make others comfortable. But that night, I realized,some saying me  “You deserve love too. Don’t be sad if they see you as an outcast.”

Lady, if you’re reading this, please ignore it. Pretend you never read it.

I use the steam wand just to add some hot water to my coffee to make it a little bit longer, I very rarely use it to froth milk (maybe once every 1-2 months).

So what is the best way to prevent clogging from the valve:

* Stop using steam wand (for water and/or steam)?
* Descale more often (with a follow-up)?
   * Descale only through the steam wand?
   * Descale both through steam wand and group head?
* Use some sort of anti scale filter directly in the water tank?
* A combination of some/all of the above?
* Throw machine in the thrash and buy something else?

Also, this is going to be really long, and I'm not including a TL;DR just because there is so much being said here that I don't think I can summarize it cohesively. 

I have worked at my TJ Maxx for almost five years now, mostly in sales floor recovery. I am trained in nearly every single area of the store, excluding backroom unboxing. I have seen hundreds of people come and go from this place, and have mostly stayed because I like my coworkers and the managers are extremely flexible with my schedule. However, this semi-good working environment has declined rapidly within the past year, and it's only going to get worse now that Christmas is starting. 

For most of the year we have had no wiggle room with payroll. We've essentially been operating on skeleton crews since January, and even though we are literally about to be in the holiday season, it's like there's just no payroll to be found. Just the other day we had to quickly leave after closing because they ran out of hours. Literally how are we running out of hours in OCTOBER? My store is a highly shopped, as well, which usually requires us to have at least one person in every department on the sales floor for closing shift. Is there ever enough people? No. Maybe half the days I work there are enough people on the floor to actually have a proper recovery.

On Fridays and Saturdays, which are our busiest days, we may have one closing cashier (or no one at all) and maybe three people (four if we're lucky) on the sales floor. But are we able to get anything done? Again, no, because all of us spend 90% of our shifts ringing out these ungrateful, rude, and verbally abusive customers who will genuinely spend almost my ENTIRE SHIFT shopping. But regardless of what they say to me, I just have to take it with a smile because that's customer service apparently. And even after us sales floor people not only recover our departments, but cover breaks in the fitting room and jewelry, help ring, AND help the floor coordinators with projects or stocking they didn't finish during the day, we're still bitched at because none of us have at least a 1% credit rate.

Mind you, we are in a small town where the only ""competitor"" is Walmart, if you can even consider TJ Maxx and Walmart comparable. So we see repeat customers all the time who have no interest in applying for a credit card that literally has an interest rate of 34.99% with little benefits unless you're suffering from a retail addiction. At the very least, we used to be able to get a candy bar for getting credits, but now we're not even allowed to do that. We basically have to sell these credit cards without any fair compensation, often times to customers who don't even understand how they work. I cannot tell you the amount of times I've had 18 and 19 year old kids apply for these credit cards without even having a credit history or knowing ANYTHING about how credit works. 

But the worst right now is the abysmally shitty training and the ""blitz,"" specifically on the sales floor. I come in every evening to close with a department that has barely even been touched all day, new items stocked in the wrong places entirely, and my go-backs having sat and stacked up all day long. And God forbid you suggest to someone working day shift that maybe they could help by taking five minutes to run some go-backs, because then you'll be stuck hearing an entire oral dissertation about how they have to stock, and do projects, and ring, as if we literally do not have to do the same shit in the evening with less time. Oh, and let's not forget the myriad of messes they leave everywhere with this silent expectation that I'm going to take care of it. And to be honest, during my first few years there, I probably would have just rolled my eyes and cleaned it up. I don't do that anymore.

For example, last Friday the markdown team went through the towel aisle and proceeded to turn all the towels to the side to scan them (which I understand is necessary) and then just DIDN'T put them back. So I let them sit for days to see if anyone would every address it considering it's a mess that they made, and guess what? No one did, so I was stuck having to finally fix it after waiting four fucking days. They have also stocked handsoaps in my department (like an entire endcap full) even though they go on the opposite side of the store. Instead of placing gift bags on the pegs (even when there are literally empty pegs right there), they sit them on the baseboards and leave them. They won't even dare try to move something to make room for more stock, they just sit the new stock on top of the old stock, which makes my recovery 10x harder because now I'm recovering a mess the customers made, which has had a bunch of notebooks stacked on top of it. And there is literally no attempt to even try and uphold the flow anymore. Every aisle is completely disorganized, and it makes me wonder how customers can even shop them, because I can't. 

Every single time I have tried to use the open door policy and speak up about this, I'm met with ""well, we can't control the blitz"" or ""we're trying to train these people."" This has been going on since January, and I'm sick of it. I have taken every suggested avenue, done everything I can, and nothing changes because all this company cares about is making an extra buck. They will take every single resource from their workers and force us to operate on skeleton crews if it means that Susan will buy some shitty coffee syrup for $7.99. I'm genuinely disgusted by the direction this company has taken over the past year, especially since my first few years with this company were pretty okay. And honestly, I have no hope that it's going to change. ",2,1760733279.0,TjMaxx,3,0.67,False

Figured I’d give this a shot. I’m just looking to meet some chill people to talk to and maybe build some genuine connections. I’m into movies (always down for random recommendations or deep dives), cars, and I play a bit of piano when I need to clear my head and I've recently started learning guitar, which is a fun little challenge(tbh piano is way easier to learn).

I love trying out different cuisines and finding hidden cafes or small spots with good coffee and atmosphere, especially when I’m traveling. There’s something about exploring new places that just never gets old.

If you’re someone who enjoys good convos, or just sharing random thoughts about life, hit me up. Always nice meeting people who get it.",1,1760733275.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

His betrayal dealt a heavy blow to their mating bond, weakening and tormenting Olivia's wolf. She tried to put an end to this drama, to win him back. Yet Marsh believed it was perfectly normal for an Alpha to have both a Luna and a side piece. After an emotional struggle, Olivia decided to reject Marsh, but he didn't agree. Just then, the legendary, rich, and powerful Alpha Zander Wells showed up. To Olivia's surprise, she found herself drawn to Zander as if he was her mate. But how could she have two mates?!Chapter 1  
  
  
Olivia's POV  
  
  
""Thank the Moon Goddess, you finally came back to me, my love,"" my mate cooed to Emily Brown.  
  
  
Today, my mate Marsh Walton was officially crowned the Alpha of the Dawn Pack.  
  
  
Right after he swore to make the pack thrive before all shifters in the pack square, he took Emily's hand, confessing his love for her.  
  
  
Everyone was stealing glances at me, talking in whispers. The awkward tension was almost palpable.  
  
  
I froze on the spot, staring at the ""love birds"" in disbelief.  
  
  
Because I was Marsh's mate and Luna! I should've been the one sharing the moment of glory with him!  
  
  
""You okay, Luna Olivia?"" Marsh's Beta, Jeffrey Sanders, shot me a concerned look.  
  
  
I forced a smile, telling him I was fine.  
  
  
Only the Moon Goddess knew I was bleeding inside.  
  
  
Of course I wasn't okay! My mate was acting all lovey-dovey with another she-wolf at his accession ceremony!  
  
  
I walked over to the table and grabbed a glass of red wine, trying to drown my sorrows.  
  
  
The bitter taste of alcohol spread in my mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pang in my heart.  
  
  
Just as I turned my head, I saw Emily chatting with Marsh, all smiles.  
  
  
After he said something that made her chuckle, she pecked him on the cheek.  
  
  
I clenched my fists, biting my lip to hold back my tears.  
  
  
The shifters of the Dawn Pack were watching the two, gossiping among themselves.  
  
  
Since we werewolves had keen hearing, I could hear their chatter loud and clear.  
  
  
One old she-wolf exclaimed, ""Can't believe little Emily's all grown up now.""  
  
  
Another middle-aged he-wolf chimed in, sounding confused, ""I remember her mate's Darcy, Alpha Darcy, I mean, from the Moonshadow Pack. What is she doing here?""  
  
  
""Who knows? But I heard she was Alpha Marsh's first love. If it weren't for Marsh's grandfather's disapproval, she would've been our Luna. But Marsh never stopped pining for her,"" the old she-wolf replied.  
  
  
""Poor Luna Olivia,"" sighed the he-wolf while shaking his head.  
  
  
My wolf Elara let out a soft whine in my mind, showing her dissatisfaction.  
  
  
Just like these two were saying, Emily was my mate's first love. And she came to the Dawn Pack out of the blue about a month ago.  
  
  
Since then, Marsh seemed to have turned into a whole different person. I couldn't find any trace of the man who loved me unconditionally.  
  
  
Back when his private business was tanking, I merged my company with his just to stop it from going bust. And I even helped him run it using my business talents.  
  
  
While his corporation was thriving now, he started to give me the cold shoulder, like all my sacrifices meant nothing.  
  
  
Noticing my stare, Emily snuggled against Marsh's chest, a glint of mockery in her eyes.  
  
  
I turned away, feeling disgusted.  
  
  
Spinning around, I decided to make my way to the other side of the pack square, where there was a two-story viewing platform.  
  
  
After climbing the stairs, I took a deep breath, hoping it would calm myself.  
  
  
""Why are you standing all lonely over here, my dear Luna? Aren't you gonna join the celebration?"" An annoying female voice sounded behind me.  
  
  
I turned around, only to find Emily smirking at me.  
  
  
""If I were you, I would get the hell outta here. Marsh's my mate. I'm sure the shifters in this pack wouldn't welcome a whore who tries to seduce their Alpha.""  
  
  
""The only reason Marsh mated with you was that he needed a Luna to inherit the Dawn Pack. I'm the one he loves. Just you wait. I'll make him reject you in no time,"" she scoffed.  
  
  
I knitted my brows, wondering what scheme she was brewing.  
  
  
But soon, I realized what she wanted to do.  
  
  
She strutted over to the stairs and yelled, ""Olivia! What are you doing?!""  
  
  
With that, she stepped right off the edge.  
  
  
Caught off guard, I instinctively reached out to grab her.  
  
  
Yet, she grasped my hand and pulled me down with her.  
  
  
After a piercing pain, we both tumbled down to the landing.  
  
  
I lay on the ground, grimacing, while my wolf growled and started healing me.  
  
  
Soon, I heard footsteps approaching.  
  
  
""Emily!"" Marsh shouted, panicking as he rushed to her side.  
  
  
Without hesitation, he scooped her up into his arms.  
  
  
I lifted my head, an injured look in my eyes, but he didn't even glance my way.  
  
  
I shifted my gaze to Emily, who was sobbing in Marsh's arms, ""Please don't blame Olivia. She didn't mean to hurt me.""  
  
  
""Shhh. I'm taking you to the pack doctor,"" Marsh said gently.  
  
  
With that, he carried her off, and the on-looking shifters left, too.  
  
  
After a long while, I finally managed to struggle to my feet.  
  
  
""That despicable bitch! Let me take over. I'll end her!"" Elara growled in my mind.  
  
  
""Chill, girl. Don't act on impulse,"" I tried to calm her down.  
  
  
When I was finally heading to my room to take a shower, Marsh stopped me.  
  
  
""You snake! How dare you push Emily down the stairs!"" he spat.  
  
  
""I didn't,"" I shot back, trying to defend myself.  
  
  
""She told me so before she passed out! She would never lie to me,"" he snapped, fuming.  
  
  
""You trust her over me?! I'm your mate!"" I yelled.  
  
  
Marsh just glared at me in silence.  
  
  
Then, he brought his pillow and blanket and walked to the guest room where Emily was staying, leaving me dumbfounded.  
  
  
""Marsh!"" I chased after him, trying to grab his arm, yet he spun around and snarled at me.  
  
  
Feeling intimidated, I stopped in my tracks.  
  
  
Marsh then rushed towards Emily's room.  
  
  
Heartbroken, I returned to our room and took a shower.  
  
  
In the shower, I checked the scratches on my body.  
  
  
Suddenly, a sharp pain I'd never experienced before shot through my heart.  
  
  
I clutched my chest and fell onto the floor.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Olivia's POV  
  
  
Lying on the floor, I felt utterly helpless. Luckily, the pain soon subsided.  
  
  
Tears started to cloud my eyes as a deep sense of betrayal washed over me.  
  
  
Despite it being my first time feeling the pain, I knew what caused it—my mate had been staying by Emily's side, probably acting intimately.  
  
  
Just like how Emily kissed Marsh earlier today.  
  
  
In the werewolf world, when your mate snogged someone else after marking and claiming you, you'd experience such intense pain.  
  
  
It was like an alarm from the Moon Goddess.  
  
  
If they got physical, I could be in for even worse torture.  
  
  
I'd heard cases of werewolves who got weak and ended up losing their wolves because their mates had cheated on them.  
  
  
If I kept turning a blind eye, it was only a matter of time before that tragedy befell me.  
  
  
Making up my mind, I made my way to the bathroom and freshened up.  
  
  
When I stepped out, Beta Jeffrey approached me, saying, ""Luna Olivia, Alpha Justin wants you to meet him in the reception room.""  
  
  
""Where's Marsh? I wanna talk to him,"" I asked.  
  
  
""Alpha Marsh's in the reception room with Emily,"" he told me, a sympathetic look on his face.  
  
  
Quelling my distress, I walked to the reception room.  
  
  
Alpha Justin, Marsh's grandfather, was sitting on the right, while Marsh and Emily were on the left.  
  
  
A wave of sadness surged within me as I noticed how their fingers intertwined.  
  
  
I was so madly in love with him, going all out just so he could reach the apex of his career. And now, he was cheating on me in my face.  
  
  
""You fool!"" Alpha Justin exclaimed, snapping me back to reality.  
  
  
He then hurled his coffee cup at me, hot coffee splattering all over my body.  
  
  
I couldn't help but cry out in pain.  
  
  
""What kind of Luna are you?"" he hissed while glaring at me.  
  
  
""Why are you doing this to me? I didn't do anything wrong,"" I calmly shot back. ""The one you were supposed to punish is Marsh. He flirted with Emily in public!""  
  
  
Alpha Justin shot a furious look at Marsh. ""Are you waiting for me to tell her what she's done wrong?!""  
  
  
Marsh immediately snapped, ""We've got other packs' Alphas and Lunas here for the ceremony, and you just disgraced our pack by pushing Emily!""  
  
  
""I didn't push her! And what right have you got to accuse me? You're the one shaming our pack, Mr. Adulterer!""  
  
  
""Enough!"" Alpha Justin slapped the table and stood up. ""Marsh, I want this mess sorted out.""  
  
  
With that, he stormed out.  
  
  
Marsh turned and roared at me, ""You think pulling this stunt's gonna make me leave Emily? Nice try!""

Brewing Zombie Dust clone, intention was single stage fermentation in a plastic Fermonster for 14 days, dropping 3oz Citra that would have been in a hop bag secured by Sous vide magnets, to avoid opening the fermenter 7 days before kegging.

Is there a DIY alternative that would do the trick?  I don’t have pantyhose or cheesecloth at home.  My next thought was maybe using a plastic flip top sandwich bag, which would suspend the hops and then sink with marbles & sous vide magnet, setting them loose as free range hops.  I’d prefer not to go free range if possible, but given the situation, I’m willing to accept it this time.
Any ideas?

Από την μία λίγα άτομα που νοιάζονται για τον συνάνθρωπο που βρίσκεται σε μία τόσο δύσκολη θέση και εκτός από την πείνα και το κρύο έχει να αντιμετωπίσει και το κοινωνικό στίγμα-προκατάληψη, από την άλλη πολλά άτομα (η πλειοψηφία) που προτιμάει να δώσει 4€ για έναν φραπέ από κανένα Μικέλ/Γρηγόρη/Coffee Island παρά να πιει με 2€ και να δώσει τα υπόλοιπα σε αυτούς που κυριολεκτικά δεν έχουν τίποτα.

Έχω μιλήσει με πολλούς αστέγους στον δρόμο. 

Οι ΜΚΟ τους πηγαίνουν φαγητά και τίποτα μεταχειρισμένα ρούχα (που σχεδόν πάντα δεν είναι στα μέτρα τους αλλά τέλος πάντων, κάτι είναι και αυτό)  , τρώνε και στα συσσίτια στις εκκλησίες, κοιμούνται και στους ξενώνες του Δήμου και αυτό.

Πως αυτοί οι άνθρωποι θα ενσωματωθούν στην κοινωνία όταν η ίδια η κοινωνία (όλοι εμείς δηλαδή) τους γυρνάμε την πλάτη και απλά λέμε ""έλα μωρέ, όλο και κάποιος θα τους δώσει κάτι, γιατί να το κάνω εγώ,"" ; 

Υπάρχουν αυτοί που θέλουν να βοηθήσουν αλλά δεν μπορούν, υπάρχουν και αυτοί που μπορούν αλλά δεν θέλουν, δεν απευθύνομαι στους πρώτους.

Το να ζεις στο δρόμο είναι ίσως το χειρότερο πράμα που μπορεί να συμβεί σε κάποιον, ακόμα και στη φυλακή να είσαι έχεις εξασφαλισμένα 3 γεύματα την ημέρα και δεν κινδυνεύεις από το κρύο και τις αρρώστιες (επειδή σε περίπτωση που δεν το ξέρετε, οι περισσότεροι άστεγοι αποφεύγουν τα νοσοκομεία εκτός αν είναι κάτι εξαιρετικά επείγον, αφού στα νοσοκομεία αν πάνε τους θεωρούν ναρκομανείς ή επικίνδυνους και συνέχεια γίνονται φασαρίες εκεί πέρα).

Αναρωτηθείτε λίγο το εξής: αν περιτριγυρίζεσαι από ανομία (επειδή αν είσαι άστεγος θα είσαι άστεγος και το μεσημεροαπόγευμα που βγαίνουν οι φοιτητές για βόλτα αλλά **και** στις 3 και 4 το πρωί, με ό,τι αυτό συνεπάγεται) από αρρώστιες, από έλλειψη κατανόησης-ενσυναίσθησης-αλληλεγγυής-στήριξης, αν δεν έχεις παρά τα απολύτως απαραίτητα για να επιβιώσεις, αν δεν μπορείς καν να μιλήσεις σε κάποιον ψυχολόγο (επειδή προφανώς και δεν θα είσαι τέλεια με όλα όσα περνάς σε καθημερινή βάση)  **πως** θα βγεις από όλο αυτό το χάος και θα σταθείς στα πόδια σου; 

Υπάρχουν πάνω από 400 άστεγοι στην Θεσσαλονίκη σύμφωνα με μετρήσεις όμως αυτή είναι η ""επίσημη"" πληροφορία, δεν επισκέφτηκαν οι κοινωνικοί λειτουργοί κάθε εγκαταλελειμμένο σπίτι ή εργοστάσιο να δουν αν εκεί μέσα βρήκε κάποιος άστεγος καταφύγιο, απλά έκαναν μία εικασία ότι ίσως να είναι τόσοι.

Και άντε να βρουν δουλειά μερικής απασχόλησης με ελάχιστα χρήματα ως διανομείς φυλλαδίων ή κάτι τέτοιο, πως θα φτάσουν να έχουν σπίτι (να νοικιάσουν δηλαδή έστω και με λίγα τετραγωνικά) όταν οι τιμές των ενοικίων είναι στον θεό; 

Είναι καταδικασμένοι αυτοί οι άνθρωποι, όχι επειδή είναι άστεγοι αλλά επειδή εμείς (η πλειοψηφία) τους αντιμετωπίζει ως παρίες.

Όλοι μπορούμε να βρεθούμε ανά πάσα στιγμή στην θέση τους, δεν είναι ότι γεννήθηκαν σε κατάσταση αστεγίας, όλοι είμαστε εν δυνάμει άστεγοι.

Όλοι έχουμε δει έστω έναν άστεγο/μία οικογένεια αστέγων, κάπου στην πόλη, και (θέλω να πιστεύω) όλοι έχουμε κάτι που δεν χρειαζόμαστε καν, κάποιο παλιό μεταχειρισμένο ρούχο που δεν μας χωράει ή φαγητά τα οποία πλησιάζουν την ημερομηνία λήξης όμως δεν πρόκειται να τα καταναλώσουμε, 2-3-4 ευρώ που σκοπεύουμε να τα πετάξουμε κυριολεκτικά στο ΠΡΟΠΟ (δεν θα γίνεις εκατομμυριούχος/α από αυτά φίλε/η αναγνώστη/ρια, στημένα είναι και κερδίζει πάντα η ""μάνα"" όπως στα καζίνο) ή στο οτιδήποτε.

Πράματα τα οποία εμείς θεωρούμε ασήμαντα και δεδομένα και όμως για αυτούς είναι ζήτημα ζωής και θανάτου.

1, κάτι εκατομμύρια πολίτες που μένουν σε σπίτια (μικρά, μεγάλα ή τεράστια, δεν έχει σημασία) και 400-600 άστεγοι.

***ΥΣ - πριν γράψεις ότι είναι ""κλισέ"" και ""έχει ξανα συζητηθεί άπειρες φορές στο παρελθόν"" , η απάντησή μου είναι: ε και; τι επειδή ξανασυζητήθηκε ή είναι ""κλισέ"" ; Από πότε ο αλτρουισμός είναι ""κλισέ"" ;  Ακόμα υπάρχουν οι 400-600 άστεγοι, προφανώς και δεν αρκούν οι ΜΚΟ εθελοντικές ομάδες ή τα συσσίτια των εκκλησιών ή ο Δήμος, αφού ακόμα υπάρχουν, αλλιώς δεν θα τους έβλεπες καν να ζητιανεύουν τα απολύτως απαραίτητα.***

Our first stop will be in Tokyo, before eventually going to Hakone for a ryokan and then on to Kyoto. I am specifically looking for feedback/input on the Tokyo portion of our itinerary.

For reference, we are both late 20s and active, so we're fine with lots of walking/standing. We will be staying in a hotel in Shinjuku, very close to Shinjuku Station.

We love food, shopping, culture and history, nature/parks, and electronics + gaming (neither of us is very into anime though).

  
**Day 1 - Thursday, December 4th**

* 6 pm - Land at HND and use the hotel shuttle service to arrive at the hotel 
* 7/8 pm - Explore Shinjuku. Grab Dinner. Early bed

Not expecting to do much this day, so it's really Day 0.

  
**Day 2 - Friday, December 5th**

* Wake up, grab coffee/matcha, walk to Meiji Jingu Shrine 
* Wander Harajuku and Takeshita 
   * Window shopping
   * Visit a cafe
* Walk to/through Omotesando
   * Check out the architecture
   * More shopping
* Lunch
* We have an izakaya tour booked at 5pm from Shinjuku Station, so at this point, we would head back towards Shinjuku:
   * Either go straight back to Shinjuku and spend time exploring within Shinjuku **OR**
   * walk through Yoyogi park and train back to Shinjuku Station
* Izakaya Tour at 5pm
* Golden Gai/Piss Alley/Drinks afterwards

Activities in this day feel very vague as I was trying to leave us flexibility to wander around and check out anything (donki/ 7/11 /shops/cafes/etc) we see that looks interesting. Please let us know if there are specific things we should seek out/avoid in these areas (I'm aware Takeshita is mostly a tourist trap, but we figured it would be worth a walk-through).

**Day 3 - Saturday, December 6th**

* Early morning Senso-ji Temple
* Nakamise Dori
* Kappabashi for kitchen/knife shopping
* Head back towards Ueno and grab an early lunch on the way
* Tokyo National Museum
* Ueno Park on the way to Akihibara
* Akihibara **AND/OR** Tokyo Skytree + Christmas Market(?)
* Dinner

This day feels very packed so far. I am a big gamer, and we both love to check out modern tech, but neither of us is very into anime. I'm thinking Akihibara may not take up too much of our time in that case? We are also considering doing Shibuya Sky at the beginning/end of Day 3, so we would skip Tokyo Skytree in that case (unless it's recommended over Shibuya Sky)

**Day 4 - Sunday, December 7th**

We would ideally like to do some actual shopping for souvenirs/selvedge denim/vintage clothes/sneakers. We don't want to spend a whole day shopping, so any recommendations on activities/sites/restaurants in the areas below would be a big help.

* Not sure what to do this morning since it seems most stores open around 10-12
* Shimokitazawa and/or Daikanyama for shopping and lunch (store recommendations or preferences would be greatly appreciated here)
* Ginza for Chuo Dori, maybe?
* Back to Shibuya for the afternoon/evening
   * crossing and Shibuya Sky at sunset
* Dinner
* Roppongi for drinks

**Day 5 -**  **Monday, December 8th**

We leave for Hakone this day, so we would likely only have the morning. Likely staying close to Shinjuku

**Things sounded interesting, but we haven't included:**

* teamLabs Planets/Borderless
   * We weren't planning on visiting either of the teamLabs installations, but would reconsider if they really are entertaining and worth visiting. Our concern with planets was getting our clothing wet before heading back out into the cold December weather.
* Edo Open Air Museum
* Ghibli Musem
   * As much as I love Spirited Away, I am not very familiar with the other works enough to try and get tickets (heard it's near impossible for people not in Japan) and dedicate a day to visiting
* DisneySea
   * Sounds really cool, but it felt like a waste to lose a day of exploring for a theme park
* Imperial Palace
   * We assumed the gardens would be mostly dead in December
* Odaiba
* Ebisu
* Tea Ceremony
   * Likely going to do this in Kyoto
* Watch Sumo Wrestling
   * Sounds great, but didn't feel like we had time to book an experience and I didn't see any active tournaments going on while we are in town. If any of our itinerary is redundant, we would be open to booking a tour to watch a practice session or match.

1o9c7w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1o9c7w2/think_i_may_have_just_had_a_mc/,Think I May Have Just Had A MC?,"Hello, I am in desperate need of some support, questions answered & not sure how to feel. I am 29 and had my tubes tied and burned around 5 years ago. I became super overweight after and just recently lost around 60+lb this year. I have not had any missed periods, late periods, pregnancy symptoms or anything in the 5 years of my tubes being tired until recently. I ask these questions because 1 I don’t have insurance and 2 the places I have called have not been helpful and thought maybe there is someone out there with a similar experience. 

On 9/28/25 I went to the ER due to some symptoms I was having and found out I had a tampon left in for a week and lucky to have not had TSS. They removed it did blood work and everything was fine. 

Fast forward to 10/10/25 I randomly became extremely tired that night to the point I laid down and was out like a light. 

On 10/11/25 i woke up and did not feel that great almost like I was sick with a cold or flu (this is common for me from previous pregnancies) but my boyfriend had been sick so figured I might have caught his germs. I go grab a coffee and move on about my day it wasn’t terrible but became super moody and by the end of the day I just felt down right bad. 

10/12/25 I wake up and just am so sick and feel like I have the flu. Take my weightloss shot anyways and regular flu and cold medicine. Go to bed.

10/13/25 I wake up and am so sick I couldn’t even work (I work remote from home) to the point I slept literally the entire day, my boyfriend had to come pick me up, take me to his house and take care of me. 

10/14/25 I wake up & work but still drained & feel like I just can’t stand the world and everything was irritating me and just wanted to get everything around the house done and be done with the day. 

10/15/25 I get up, I feel the best I’ve felt in days. Great mood! I was sunshine and rainbows like I had never been before.  (Was supposed to start my period this day) go to bed it’s a great night. 

10/16/25 wake up still in a good mood but no period. Sexually active that morning & when I start work I started to cramp really bad and my stomach hurt and went to the bathroom to see I’m bleeding some. Think nothing of it because I think or thought it was my period. Oddly the blood never gets heavy like it normally does on my first day like not even enough to wear a tampon. End of the day comes I go to my boyfriends and before I left I put a tampon in just in case I did start heavy next thing I know I am bleeding through the tampon and it’s so bad I had to get in the shower (not usual for my first day of my period) so I shower change the tampon. The only bad issue I had this day was cramping and no matter what I did my stomach hurt so bad like it felt like no matter what I did the cramps wouldn’t stop and hurt so bad I had to nap on my lunch. 

Today 10/17/25 wake up in a good mood & still bleeding pretty bad which is still not unusual for me but the cramps were so bad driving home was even rough. When I got home didn’t let it stop me and did my morning routine. I sat down and started work and it got worse and kept feeling like I needed to poop. Also all of a sudden got an odd headache, light ringing in my ears and felt so tired I physically thought I was going to fall asleep at my desk. So I go to try to poop thinking maybe if I did that I’d feel better and that’s why I felt bad because my stomach still hurt and usually my cramps make me to need to do that. I sit down and push and cramp so bad I feel like I’m dying but no poop. I feel like something fall out of me (usually blood clots) didn’t think anything of it. Finally I get up and look in the toilet and what I see is something I have never seen before during my period that I’ve passed before. It was big and there was what looks like some tissue to it and very bloody. I almost wanted to pick it up out of the toilet but instead took some pictures to send my mom and aunts because thought I could be over reacting. I send the pictures and they all say it looks like I miscarried. The cramps have now subsided substantially, the bleeding and lightened substantially, no more headache or ringing in my ears & the fatigue isn’t as bad. 

If I was pregnant and what is in my picture is a miscarriage I would have only been no more than 2 weeks if that from my calculations because on 9/28 my blood HCG came back negative for pregnancy and they did an internal and external pelvic ultrasound and never mentioned seeing anything. 

I wish I could post the pictures but I don’t think that is permitted but maybe describing the circumstances & timing and stuff has anyone ever had a miscarriage happen like this or these symptoms? I know most people are different but it’s mentally taxing me a little not knowing how I should feel. 

Family keeps saying to move on and leave it be and just take it as a sign to act like I never had my tubes tied or burned but me and my boyfriend both are still not bothered by it but we can’t just let it leave our minds or thoughts because we don’t know & if i truly did have a miscarriage that is very sad to both of us. 

I hope everything I’ve said is okay. Thoughts, opinions? ",1,1760732779.0,Miscarriage,4,1.0,False

I know the last part is kinda undeveloped but I'm still looking to grow out whatever I can in this concept.

Writing:

...for a life in my own hands.

Spiraling awake, something like steam hit me. Suddenly, there was a strong, bitter taste in my mouth.

Although I was alone in my dark room, a voice from somewhere inside me called out, scratching all my senses with a single, desperate wish—coffee.

The word rang in my head, letter by letter, piercing every inch of my half-asleep mind. I needed to calm my urges.

My room starting to warp and twist, leading me out of my apartment and into the endlessly winding, clean, marble spiral stairwell. I hadn’t noticed its beauty up to then, it almost hypnotized me. But the only source of light snapped me out of it: a big, glossy window illuminated by a single streetlamp.

My eyes stung, blinded by the warm light. The lamp shone down on the street on a café that I could swear wasn’t there before.

Choking the anomaly up to my tiredness, I kept tracking down the almost infinite spiral. My hair stood up when I looked to my right and saw the same view I had seen from a few flights up.

An uneasy feeling started growing in me—but before it could blossom, I got distracted by my first clear thought in what felt like days:

“I need caffeine.”

Three simple words, echoing the same way the voice from earlier had called out—but this time, it was my very own thought. Not something out of a feverish nightmare.

It was real. The first thing that night I knew to be real.

Reaching the first floor, I looked to where there should have been a big ground-to-ceiling sliding door with one tall marble column on each side. It was opening up to a whole new world where this was the one and only dark passage.

I don’t remember seeing any kind of door, only the darkness where it should have been. Somehow, my reality was being twisted like I was in a terrible dream.

My unease turned to dread when I saw the same window—but this time, a black figure was staring back. Its skin, like black velvet, consuming all the light that reached it.

The figure moved into the café, not walking, but shifting—bit by bit, like static. It disappeared into the darkness, almost like mist, leading the way. Its disappearance troubling me more than calming me.

I followed, out of instinct, as if my brain had turned off and I was being moved by my body—forced by a mindless parasite.

This parasite—or urge, or whatever it was—spread through me, and I kept losing more of myself along the way, the hunger consuming me ever more.

I felt like a passenger, endlessly moving with the goal of relieving myself of this unsettling feeling. A black box keeping me caged in my own consciousness, disallowing my connection with reality.

“Where am I?” Was this my will, or something other?

I walked around this dark place, my hands unable to move—when I realized a tingling, numbing sensation: fear, mixed with the great need for something. Something that had already spread through every part of myself that I could still feel.

“Come,” a voice called.

A familiar voice—yet I could swear I had never heard it before.

It gently called again—this time, it felt like I was being disassembled and reassambled , the voices sound echoing strangely around where my eardrums should have been, dropping into me as cold as a droplet of water in a still pond.

Everything felt uneasy. My hands felt wrong. The sifting darkness below reminding of translucent obsidian, with the single light above still present reflecting off the mirror-like ground. Existence in that moment was blissfully haunting. 

tick... tick... tick... tick...

The drops pierced me like a metronom with every next drop, fading more and more, echoing in a ever so calming manner until I was finally in myself again. As if someone called me back to truth and had closed Pandora’s box, saving me.

Now I stood in the café with no memory of walking here, I found myself under that same persistent, warm light. Under it a small, round table, meant for one—and it worried me that the one was me.

But even though it was set for me only I felt the attendance of the voice, but now it was more intense, a pressure slowly rising. The voices sat around me as if waiting for something to happen.

On the table sat a small, white mug, which seemed to give off a bitter smell that lingered in the air, luring me toward it.

The aroma in the air was talking to me “The usual?” it whispered in at least a hundred distinct voices. It knew me like nothing else. It sounded like it enjoyed toying with me. In the back of my mind, like crawling bugs you know are there but can only hear. They exchanged words, mocking me planning what to do next.

Looking at the mug from above it was almost entirely coloured dark like a black hole—the only thing visible in it being the strikingly comforting white spiral moving round and round.

I slowly felt myself float away into my mind. I sat there staring for what felt like forever, staring at the mug. But nothing changed. The quiet, empty café was the same.

The only difference was me.

I was the same in every way—except for the holding the pressure of an existing looming presence. Beyond me. Independent of me. Yet, living inside of me, connecting me to everything else around—and still pointing me to the lonely table.

“I need it.”

With hunger urging me to consume, I uncontrollably sprang toward the white mug, and with one fell swoop, the mug was free of its dark-matter contents.

But nothing changed. Not the urge. Not the need for something more. And definitely not the fear of this thing stringing me around. But I didn’t try to separate from it. It's easier this way.

Those sickly echoes, mirroring my weak will, did not stop.

Looking around, wondering what to do next, I decided this strange, surreal night should finally end.

I retraced my steps. With each step, the voices on my back grew louder. I walked back to my block. Up the spiral stairs—unending, like the voices in my head mocking me.

I went into my pitch-black room. I never thought I would be so happy to see my ugly, half-detached, yellowish room number thinking this would all stop, but it wasn’t going to. By what I could tell, it was only the start.

I floated onto my bed and fading into the surrounding nothingness. The last thing I remember before drifting away was the sharp, hot, steamy smell of the same coffee that had been the culprit of all this.

I was so tired that I thought I heard a whisper from behind my walls

“Thank you, come again.”

But before I could realize where the bitterness in the air was coming from—I had disappeared, like the white helix’s pearly, thinning tail, endlessly spiraling…

“Even in my dreams, they persist. I cannot tell reality from the darkness of my nightmares. They mock me for my dependencies. I want to stop, but I cannot. They disallow me. I need them. I cannot continue without them.“

I wish…

1o9bydv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askberliners/comments/1o9bydv/she_said_shes_not_physically_attracted_after_3/,She said she’s not physically attracted after 3 beautiful dates — I’m heartbroken and trying to understand just why,"Long post alert 🚨

Hi everyone,

I (male, mid-30s) reconnected with a friend from university about a month ago after several years without contact though we're following each other on social media. This time, the connection felt completely different — deeper and more emotional. We clicked right away through long conversations, shared interests, mental chemistry, and a calm, respectful energy. In total, we met three times.

On our third meeting she came to my place. I cooked dinner and set up an instant and surprised small candle-light table. The evening felt warm and natural and so peaceful, we talked deeply, laughed, and she even asked to hug me during middle of the dinner. It was a long, quiet hug that felt special. We didn’t kiss or do anything more intimate, mostly because I wanted to go slowly, just as she preferred, and make sure she felt comfortable, safe, and not pressured.

After that meeting, she told me she needed to “process her feelings” before coming to a final decision whether we go further.

Two days later, upon her instant request, we met again at the exact same spot as our first date and she told me that even though she felt emotionally and mentally close to me, she wasn’t physically attracted and couldn’t continue the relationship.

She offered friendship instead and said she wouldn’t contact me unless I wrote first. I decided not to take the friendship offer because I knew it would hurt too much in the future.

Since then, I haven’t written her or checked her stories. It’s been only a week, but it feels INCREDIBLY HEAVY. I can’t stop replaying everything, wondering if she used “no physical attraction” as an excuse, or if she truly felt that way. We never even kissed, so it’s hard for me to believe she could know for sure. I keep thinking about that hug, the dinner, all our beautiful moments, how peaceful it felt, and how quickly everything ended.

In all our four meetings, I tried to show her small gestures of care and love like bringing her flowers, remembering the little things she liked, doing everything I could to make her feel special, almost treated her like my princess. Since our first date, every morning afterwards, she would post her first coffee photo with those same flowers, and honestly, that melted my heart.

It had only been a month, which sounds too fast to fall for someone, but love doesn’t really follow rules or timing. I don’t even know how it happened so quickly or why it affected me so deeply, but it did.

Part of me still hopes she’ll realise what we had and reach out someday. Another part of me knows I should stay silent and focus on healing. I’ve even booked a therapy appointment to help me cope, but right now I just feel lost.

I’d really appreciate hearing other perspectives, even the harsh truth:

- Have any of you had someone end things this suddenly with the same reason?
- How did you stop analysing what they were thinking and start moving on? Or even if they had any feelings?
- Does “not physically attracted” really mean there’s no chance, or can feelings like that ever change?

Thanks for reading — I know this was long, but it helps just to write it out.

Have a nice weekend! 😊",0,1760732178.0,askberliners,5,0.14,False

Heyy Sasha(not her real name)
I met you on 5th June 2024, the day I watched you walk with the receptionist introducing you to the people working there, I watched you walk with him clueless, your introverted mind freaking it but u watched you get introduced to everyone and you stood strong. We spoke two days later and the moment my eyes met yours, I was sure that they were the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen, the moon will complain to the angels about how beautiful your eyes were, the sunset on the shore would be jealous on how stunning your eyes are, a peacock wouldn't dare stand next to you.

Every breath you took, every move you did, every step you took, I adored, I admired, everytime you ranted to me I admired the way you expressed yourself, everytime we walked from the interns room to our departments I enjoyed those small conversations, the small friendship group we had and the number of times you bullyed me I watched you smile happier, the number of times I accepted that it's my fault even though it wasn't and your smerk was just so beautiful (that smile that got me head over heels for you).

This letter was supposed to be dipped in black coffee and put in an envelope, sealed tight with reddish black mark.

I wish I got to know you better before I asked you out, ik I ruined everything. It's been over a year and you have been on my mind forever, I wish I could redo everything, be the guy you would fall for, I became a vegetarian for you, learnt to cook amazing food that you like, I promise to share all my tiramisu for you and yes coffee with medium sugar and little extra strong, dbc from corner house surely fills you up but I am here to complete it knowing it's hard for you to finish.

Hope you are happy, hope you are living the way you want, hope things are better on your end. Hope the US treats you well, be safe and happy, also I changed my phone, got a better one (not the broken one)",5,1760732140.0,LoveLetters,3,1.0,False

Used SSRI for a short period, 2 weeks (I know..), didn't like it.  
5 months later, I'm thinking about getting on NDRI since coffee addiction produces some bad effects in me.  
I'm always in between of depression / low energy mood and hyper / ADHD / anxious mood after drinking my coffee. I quitted coffee for 35 days max but the low energy and depression pushed me back othin coffee addiction. For me, it's like a mini dose of amphetamine, and I don't like to see the life this way. 

I had two sessions with psych and they initially approved Wellbutirin for me but then changed their decision and send me SSRI prescription. Finally I convinced them to prescribe me NDRI.

What is your experience in this and what signs convinced you this is the medication you need to take ?",1,1760732082.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

This story deals with themes of sexual violence and trauma. Reader discretion advised. (I wanted to write a narrative about overcoming these traumas, I hope I succeeded)


A squishing sound rang out in the night as I laid there in the dark. My heart jumped, a tingling sensation radiated from my chest and down my arms. My body went numb and my breath drew quiet. Like a rock I sat there, unblinking, listening to nothing, waiting for the attack to come.

“So where are you from?” Alex asked while he was working on my bike.

“Originally? Or recently?” I asked

“I dunno, both.” His head ducked from my view to look at a part more closely.

“I grew up here, but I was born in Fresno. I moved away when I was 18 to go to college in New York though, I spent about six years out there before coming back.” 

“Wow, the big city!” He exclaimed in amusement, “I bet that was crazy” 

“It was” I answered, “I had a lot of fun, but it's also really intense out there, it was a good place to find myself at the very least.” 

“Why did you come back?” he asked, and I hesitated, after a few seconds he looked up quizzically, I contemplated how honest I should be.

“My sister, she had an… accident recently. I came back to help out” I finally stammered, at a loss for anything else to say.

“Oh, is she alright?” Alex asked.

“Yeah she’s fine, I mean she’s at a hospital, but physically she’s mostly fine, I think…” I trailed off, mumbling the rest of the sentence. I left that beat dangling there, not feeling up to alleviating the tension.

After another long silence, he finally piped up, asking “Why did your family move here when you were a kid?”

“Oh yeah, my dad had cancer” As soon as the words came out I think a piece of my soul shriveled up and died, I had to save this conversation somehow, “He’s better now! He went to the retreat over on Cabrillo road, he’s been in remission ever since. Now he works on pharmaceuticals.”

“You mean Clemente Cove?” Alex asked,

“Yeah I think so, why?”

“That place is weird” he said so matter-of-factly that I was caught off-guard. 

“What are you talking about? It's just a medical retreat.” 

“Yeah but is it though?” He scrunched up his face at me, causing me to smile involuntarily.

“Explain yourself” I stated, forcing the muscles in my cheeks back to neutral. 

“I don't know, I just heard some stuff, like people go there and have weird orgies and do cult worship or whatever.” 

I let out a cackle, “You’re ridiculous, who could possibly believe that? My dad went there because he was sick and they gave him radiation treatment. I mean, yeah they have group therapy and nice facilities, but-”

“Facilities? It's a beach mansion!” Alex interrupted, “All sorts of weirdos live in those places!”

I just stared at him for a second, wondering if he could hear himself, “So?” I declared.

“I’m just saying, people around town talk, nobody knows what really goes on in there and all the while people are magically getting cured of cancer? It's pretty weird”

I folded my arms and huffed, this was getting on my nerves, “Nobody can cure cancer, you can just send it into remission, so that there’s so little cancer left it can’t grow. It's not magic, it's medicine, and if you really wanted to know what goes on in there, why don’t you just ask my dad!”

“No thanks, I don’t feel like talking to a cultist right now” 

I swatted at his head.

“Anywho, your bike’s done!” he declared, gesturing at it with a wrench, “Care to give it a ride?”

We decided to go get some snacks and hang out at his place to watch TV. As we walked, I asked him about his life, “I grew up here too, with my brother, but we went to different high schools.” 

“Where did you go?” I asked.

“I was uh… I was homeschooled” Alex responded, rubbing his neck. “I didn’t really get along with the other kids.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” I said, a bit confused.

“It's fine, it was years ago, and besides, I learned all the same shit anybody else did.”

“What do you do now?” I asked.

“I’m a landscaper” He responded, “I mow lawns and trim hedges, pick up dog shit. It’s not very glamorous, but I could afford the bike” 

“It's a nice looking bike!” I said, struggling to think of a response.

“Oh that piece of shit? No no no, I got her second hand, I’m saving up for a real bike. I’ve got my eye on a Ducati-” 

He then started rambling on and on about horsepower and engine jargon I couldn’t understand in the slightest. I must have looked like a fish bobbing my head in agreement and muttering “Uh-huh” and “Oh yeah for sure” every now and then, just to make it sound like I could understand him. After way too long, I finally interjected, “Listen I don’t understand half of what you’re saying! I’m not a bike guy!” 

“That's alright!” Alex answered cheerfully, “Hey if we keep hanging out maybe I can teach you a thing or two.” And I agreed, knowing I wouldn’t be able to truly get it, at least we could hang out at his place when I didn’t want to be home.
“Did you hear what I said Jack?” Alex asked. 

I hadn’t, looking up from a text conversation with Damien, he wanted to meet me, but I wasn’t sure how to respond. “I’m sorry, I’ve been distracted.”

“Your ‘tism is showing” He mocked, from where he lounged, splayed out on his couch. Empty cans of Monster littered the floor of the basement he lived in. A tiny waste-basket sat in the corner that should have been emptied weeks ago, and a cheap motorcycle-patterned blanket covered in dog fur clung to the edge of the sofa. 

“You’re one to talk” I reported, absently.

“Whats up with you?” he asked, “I know you’re a depressed fuck but what’s up with your attention span?” 

I sighed, reluctant to share the whole story all at once. Nevertheless that’s what I did, if he gets to be this blunt then why can’t I? “My sister got kidnapped, and now she’s in a psych ward dealing with her trauma.”

“Oh shit! I didn’t know she was kidnapped” he responded, “Do you know who did it?”

“No, that’s what I’m thinking about. They found her on the beach, like ten days after it happened. She won't tell us anything.”

“I mean, it’s not common for crazies in the ward to speak coherently” he replied, crassly, “Aren’t the police working on it?”

“Yeah, but we haven’t heard anything yet. I know my Dad harasses them for information all the time, but I don’t think it's been helping.”

Alex thought for a moment, “Who found her?”

“Some photographer couple, they thought she was homeless for a few days, until they saw her poster.” 

“Did the cops talk to them?”

“I would assume so. Would be pretty dumb not to.”

“I mean, cops aren’t really known for their intelligence Jack, you would know that considering your… status.” I threw a sharpie at him from the coffee table.

“Do you know where they are? Maybe we can go and talk to them.”

“Why? I think if they knew anything we would have heard by now.” I asserted with exasperation.

“Because I’m bored and I want to go for a ride.” He got up and headed towards the stairs, “you gonna ride bitch or stay here?” But I was already lacing up my boots.

We flew up the freeway on that cold morning, I clung to his slender body as I tried to forget how close I was to the asphalt. The sky was a steel gray, threatening to rain as we crested the last scrubby hill of that neighborhood I had never seen before. We slowed down and parked at the address of a suburban home that had seen better days, and my feet thudded up the path of overgrown slate footstones to rap on a peeling wooden door. There was silence. Inside the house was nothing but darkness, and shadow. 

I rapped again, a shadow moved.

The door opened a crack and a woman's face peered out from under the chain lock, “Who is it?”

“Are you Ms. Song?” I pleaded.

“Yes I am” She held her head high.

“Please, I’m Cat’s brother, I need your help.”

“We don’t want any more involvement with this!” she snapped. I quickly rammed my foot in the door so she couldn’t close it.

“Please” I begged, not knowing what to do, when Alex took over.

“We’re sorry to bother you ma’am.” He spoke kindly, something I wasn’t used to coming from him, “We just want to know what happened, the police aren’t helping.”

She looked at him for a moment, a gentle smile holding still upon his face, before opening the door and reluctantly welcoming us in.

“Did she say anything to you?” I asked her

“She told me she didn’t want her mom and dad to know,” Ms. Song said from across her barren coffee table. Her house was dark, but her walls were adorned with beautiful photographs of whales and fish.

“I’m her brother, she used to tell me everything”

“Then why hasn’t she told you what happened to her?” Her eyes pierced me coldly.

“She suffered- she has brain damage” I responded, “It’s not clear she’s fully aware… of what she went through, and we don’t want to force her to relive it.” 

Ms Song sat back, her elbow resting on the arm of her chair, considering the sliding glass door. Considering the ocean that was visible just beyond it. 

“You’re a marine photographer?” I finally said, gesturing at the photos on the wall.

“Ever since I met my Eric” She replied. “We took all the photos you see here”

“You must have seen some impressive things, like the ruins off the coast?” 

“Ha! Of course not” A sarcastic smile spread across her face. 

There was a long pause, tension filling the living room like poisonous gas.

“I understand, it may be considered… disrespectful.” I carefully answered, confusion coloring my words in that foreign silence.

“Yes, and dangerous,” she scoffed, “Too dangerous, some areas are best left alone.”

“Please,” I begged again, “I just want to protect my family, please can you just tell me what you know?”

After another long moment, she regarded me with her sharp, piercing eyes “You truly want to protect her? She made me promise to tell nobody, and with this… I want to keep my word”

“Yes” I whispered

Her voice trembled, “She just said… She just asked me to get her a plan B.” 

Alex couldn’t hear my sobs over the roaring wind on our ride back home.

I was numb as we returned down those stairs into the cool dark basement he lived in. I sank heavily into his sofa, already feeling the twitch emerging in my right hand. I pushed my forehead into my palms, trying to steady them, only for my shoulders to suddenly tense involuntarily. 

“You want a drink?” Alex asked from across the room by his mini-fridge. 

“Yeah, actually I need a cigarette” I announced. 

“Fresh out” 

I stood up woodenly, “Let’s go to the gas station, I could use a walk” just as I finished, my head jerked to the side, once, twice, again.

“Are you sure?” Alex asked, worry crossing his eyes as he watched.

“Yeah man lets just fucking go”

I took a long drag as I leaned against the railing of a wheelchair ramp, fumbling the dart with my trembling fingers. The bell rang jarringly as Alex emerged from the store with a family sized bag of hot cheetos. “You want some?”

I shook my head, “Never liked those” 

“Your loss” he answered, ripping it open. 

He didn’t ask me any questions as we made our way back to his place. I didn’t really want to talk about it, he knew why I was upset anyway. The cigarette helped, just by forcing me to breathe intentionally, and the walk soothed my spasms. The fit had settled by the time we returned to that dimly lit room, but Alex handed me an ice pack anyway, saying, “It used to help me”.
