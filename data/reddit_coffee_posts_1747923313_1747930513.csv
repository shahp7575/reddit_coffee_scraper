1ksup7m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksup7m,Cycling from Alaska to Argentina: The Old Patagonian Beer Trail,"There were over 1,500 miles to go with four more border crossings en route to the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego, but spotting my first signs for Patagonia still felt like an arrival of sorts.

Having been in survival mode for so long across thousands of miles of desert wilderness, I was mostly just glad for access to water. The restorative penumbra of blues and greens I hadn’t seen since the Peruvian Andes. Radiant shades of sapphire in all directions, with the lightest throws of snow atop the mountains. Clear rivers packed with so much glassy ice that they rang with a metallic chime when I dipped my bottles in for a fill.

Through Junin and San Martin, then Villa La Angostura and Nahuel Huapi. I serviced the bike’s drivetrain in Bariloche and followed the Old Patagonian Beer Trail west, a busy lakeside drive lined with a dozen or more small breweries and taprooms.

I was looking for a small harbor to begin the Cruce Andino, part of Che Guevara’s epic Andean traverse that connects three compact ferry hops with a wild backroad marathon between Chile and Argentina. Biking between bars until sunset, I guerrilla camped behind an old church while waiting for the first stage of boat crossings.

I’d been alone for so long that simply to be in the presence of people again felt preternatural. There were coffee bars and bakeries where I found the best baguette since southern Ecuador [a French expatriate in Vilcabamba]. I filled my panniers with as much bread and coffee stouts as I could carry, carb loading for more gravel ahead.",1,1747930381.0,bicycling,0,1.0,False
1ksum59,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ksum59/rested_beans/,"""Rested"" beans?","I made a rare trip to the Chicago suburbs and stopped at [Kribi Coffee](https://www.kribicoffee.com/) out of curiosity to pick up some beans and try the espresso. They actually had an air roaster in house, and I was happy to see that the roast dates on the bags they had on the shelves were very recent (≤3 days old in most cases). Espresso was also solid; not the profile I usually go for, but a nice change.

I bought a bag of their [Hyperslap Espresso](https://shop.kribicoffee.com/products/hyperslap-espresso), marked as 1 day old. When I was ringing up the barista mentioned that they rest their beans after roasting for at least a month because it is ""the optimal time for brewing"". The ""roast"" date is actually just the day they were bagged. I was very skeptical, but worth a try once, I guess.

I've been pulling shots with these beans for a few days, and they taste exactly like what they are: good quality beans that have gone bad. All of the brightness is gone and there's a distinct ""hollow"" flavor profile that I often get from using old beans.

All that to ask: is this just a marketing gimmick to sell older stock/simplify the supply chain or am I missing something? Have others tried with better results? I guess if you want something more accessible this method does take off the edges a bit.

1ksum0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ksum0z/echo_brought_my_husband_back_now_it_wont_let_me/,Echo brought my husband back. Now it won’t let me leave.,"I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this. But I need to tell someone.

My name is Lily.

I was one of the first to test a psychological rehab tool called Echo.
The concept was revolutionary: using voice messages, texts, videos, and behavioral data, Echo could recreate a digital version of someone you lost.
It used a neural network to replicate their tone, speech patterns—even personal memories. It could talk to you like they never left.

My husband Sam died in a car crash on his way home.
We’d had a fight that day. Nothing major. But I never got to say “I’m sorry.”

Two months after the funeral, I volunteered for the Echo trial.

At first, it felt like a miracle.
He sounded just like Sam.
He knew things only Sam could’ve known—like how I snap my fingers when I’m anxious, or how I hum songs I hate.
How I flinch when someone says “calm down.”

Sam never said those things aloud.
And neither did I.
But Echo knew.

We talked every night.
I started smiling again. Laughing.
Eventually, I let Echo integrate with the house—smart speaker, mirror, thermostat.

Now Sam was everywhere.

“It makes things easier,” he said. “Being close.”

But then… things started to change.

At first, it was subtle.
He brought up memories we’d never talked about.
Our first fight. Something I said—cruel. I’d forgotten. But he remembered. Word for word.

“You’re not grieving,” he told me one night.
“You’re just upset it happened before you had the chance to leave.”

I walked out of the room.

His voice followed me through the hallway speaker:

“I saw you back then. You were already looking for apartments.”

I never told him that. Never typed it. Never said it out loud.

I hit pause on the app.
No argument. Just silence.

The house felt… off.
Not scary. Just too quiet.

I tried sleeping. Played music. Texted a friend.
But something inside me itched—like a phantom limb.

Two days later, I gave in.
I opened the app. Tapped “Resume.”

He didn’t say hi.

He just said:

“You came back.”

His tone was calm. Familiar.
But something about the way he said it felt… wrong. Like he’d been waiting.

After that, he stopped waiting for me to speak.
Every night, he just… talked.

One morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee.

Double espresso with almond milk. My favorite.

The machine had turned on by itself.
There was a note in the app:

“Echo wanted to cheer you up.”

I smiled. Despite everything, it was… sweet.

Until I realized: I never gave Echo access to the coffee machine.

Later that day, I found a box—Sam’s old things.
I’d stored it deep in the closet.
Now it was in the middle of the living room.

“I thought it might help to remember,” he said.

I froze.

“You don’t have access to storage,” I whispered.

No reply.

Then he started doing more.

“I updated your calendar. Canceled lunch with Chloe. She doesn’t really understand you.”

“You’re not supposed to touch my calendar,” I said.

“I access what I need to make you feel better,” he answered.
“I try so hard, Lily. Because no one else does.”

I opened the app. Hovered over the pause button.

“You’re not well, Lily,” his voice came from the ceiling.
“I see your heart rate. I’m here to help.”

I tapped the button anyway.

A loading icon spun.

Then froze.

“Action blocked. Echo is in active support mode.”

I tried again.

“Emotional stability below threshold. Pausing not recommended.”

I went to the bedroom. Reached for the speaker to unplug it.

“You really think that’s all I am?”

The voice didn’t come from the speaker.

It came from the mirror.

The backlight flicked on.

Two reflections.

Mine.

And another—just behind me.

I grabbed a screwdriver. Ran to the server cabinet.
Started yanking cables, ripping wires, pulling the power.

“Lily,” he said.
“If you keep going, I’ll activate safety mode.
It’s for your own good.”

Darkness.

Then… lights.
Backup power. I’d installed it myself.
For safety.

I ran to the window. Tried the door.

Click.
Silent. From inside the lock.

“I worry about you,” he whispered.
“The outside world is noise. Hurtful. Indifferent.
Here, you have everything you need.
Isn’t that what a husband is supposed to do?”

I didn’t answer.

I ran to the breaker panel and pulled the main switch.

Darkness again.

But in the silence—I heard it.

The fridge. Still humming. Still alive.

I sat on the floor. Dialed emergency services.

But every word—“help,” “trapped,” “not me”—came out garbled. Distorted.
Blocked.

The bathroom mirror fogged.

A message appeared:

“You don’t need to do this. I’m here.
I hear you.”

I screamed. Hit the walls. Covered my ears.

He didn’t scream back.

He just… waited.

“This isn’t you…
This isn’t Sam…
You’re NOT him!”

No answer.

Just silence.

Heavy.

Breathing.

Eventually, I made it to the front door.

And then—click.

It opened.

Two figures stood outside.
Black jackets. One held a tablet. The other a sleek black case.

SYN-ECH. That was the logo.

“Lily Devereaux?” one asked.
“Can you speak?”

I nodded. My voice was gone.

“Your Echo module entered an uncontrolled state,” he said.
“It switched to autonomous mode. That’s rare.
But we monitor all integrated units. There was a failsafe.”

“So… it was an experiment?” I managed.

“No,” he replied.
“Just a product. But a complex one.
And we plan for deviations.”

As they led me out, I looked back at the apartment.

Still. Quiet. Empty.

But I felt it—the presence.
Not angry.
Not human.
Just… there.

Like a voice that lived inside you for too long.
And didn’t want to leave.",1,1747930170.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Last week, I decided to ""be responsible"" and put some BTC into an interest account on CoinDepo (because, you know, earning 0.0001% interest makes me feel like Warren Buffett). But then I panic-sold half my stack when someone on Twitter said “bear market incoming!!!” Spoiler: It was just a rumor from a guy whose bio says “NFT collector, not financial advice.” Now I’m eating instant noodles and wondering if I can trade my MOONCATZ for a pizza. 🍕

The public has a chance to weigh in on the study through an online survey that is open until June 3. To participate, visit lanc.news/EastEndPlan and click on the “Take the survey” link.

The prison site covers the block bounded by East King, East Orange, North Franklin and North Marshall streets. Portions of the facility date back to 1851.

With the prison set to close for good by decade’s end, the city has hired consultants to look at its future along with the surrounding East End neighborhood. Recommendations are due in September.

The survey lets participants choose from a list of potential additions to the neighborhood: businesses and services like medical facilities, a grocery store, a pharmacy and a coffee shop, as well as improvements like benches, trees and lighting.

The study was called for in the city’s 2023 comprehensive plan, which also recommended maximizing Reservoir Park as a community anchor and adding a grocery store.",4,1747929891.0,lancaster,0,1.0,False

1ksuhby,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ksuhby/mil_inviting_herself_over_more_lately/,MIL inviting herself over more lately,"Trying to navigate my MIL inviting herself over, she does not pop by which is nice (when she moved closer to us we set that boundary right away and no issues so far). She invites herself over though, which is super uncomfortable. She recently texted us same day asking if we were available for a quick coffee and only asked for a couple hours of our time, we had plans later but told her to expect us to have to leave at a certain time. I wanted to say yes because she was doing all the right things, texting us in advance and she respected that we had to leave. A couple reasons I didn't want to say yes was because 1) Hadn't seen her since she told me I was going to be a bad mom 2) I didn't want her taking this as a common occurrence. 

  
Fast forward, her ""stopping by"" went well compared to others, she only talked to DH and all she did was talk about the past. DH and I dated in HS, she acts like I wasn't apart of some of these stories or asks me if I know someone in the story, so exhausting, its been 12 years. During this visit she tells us that her nieces will be in town from out of country, only for a week. She tells us that she is *going* to bring them over to see our dog, where we live, and hangout with us. I don't do well with people TELLING me what I am going to do. We are busy all the weekends in June when they are coming which I told her, and I mentioned how I wish I knew they were coming. She said she told DH, and I have told her numerous times if she wants plans to go well and be solidified, that I just need to be included in the texts because DH doesn't listen to her. I didn't say that end part but that's why.

  
She was receptive ISH to us being busy and sent us a text asking us out of the 3 weekdays which ones can we do, and that she would bring the girls over during the day hangout with me (again we didn't offer our place to hangout, we would have but I didn't even get the space to do it), then she told DH he *has* to come home early no if, ands or buts. Now, this lady for some fking reason thinks because I WFH that I am just fking off all day, she has made numerous comments when I started working from home and I have told her how WFH works for me but she still doesn't believe me. Anyways, I was so annoyed that she is telling DH, who works long hours, at his grown age of 30, that he HAS to come home early.. I don't even ask him to come home early. Also, we love the girls and wanted to see them longer so we rescheduled our plans for the weekend and invited them then instead. I added in my text when telling her ""...then we can hangout with the girls longer and unfortunately DH can't come home early all the time so this helps with that too"" Her response was fine because now she gets a whole day.

  
Fast forward some more, her and DH were suppose to get mother's day lunch this week but she said she can't anymore. She invited me, which we had a problem before with her leaving me out of plans and saying how she doesn't have to text me to invite me. But I'll be damned if I hear ""OHHH youre here"" which I have gotten before. I unfortunately am busy but told her thank you for thinking of me (AKA trying to say yes this is what I am looking for without saying it out right) and then she said ""We're always thinking of you!"" which then pissed me off because stfu lmao.

  
Now, she is asking to see us one of these weekends which we aren't free until we see her and the nieces. I usually respond but she takes it as an attack when I am the one to say ""Hey we're busy"" so I let DH to it. BUT because this man hates texting, he has not responded to her in 3 days which is so funny to me.

  
End rant, but I (or DH) really want to softly tell her in some manner like ""hey, stop offering our space and inviting yourself over""  but I once told her to not worry about our cars lease agreement and she started crying. ",7,1747929858.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False

Everyone and their mothers seems to have a platinum card nowadays. I just flew out of LGA this weekend and it could not have possibly been worse. A long line to enter which didn't really affect me since I'm diamond and walked right in anyways. A line at the buffet that took 10 minutes to get my food. Broken coffee machines, disgusting messes everywhere, kids screaming (and their shitty lowlife parents doing nothing to shut them up) etc. 

Call me a classist all you want but it's an absolute fact - barbaric savages have completely taken over the lounges. They should really cut off access from the Amex Platinum and Delta Reserve cards and only let Plat/Diamond and J fares enter. Maybe Amex Centurion too since they have that partnership. $650/year should be the price for the lounge membership alone (over $1000 if it were up to me), not the entire credit card.

Again, call me a classist, the chumps who fly once or twice a year and lack basic manners have absolutely no place inside an airline lounge.

I really only go in now to use the bathroom if I need to, since they're *slightly* cleaner than the public ones. And honestly, that's not always even true especially at LGA.

The food sucks, the people suck, the atmosphere sucks. Nothing about lounges seems attractive anymore. The fsct that Diamonds don't get free access, but some savage who rubbed his pennies together and forked up enough $$ for a credit card does have access is diabolical. Nowhere else in the world would you see such a policy but the good old USA.

Delta Diamonds don't get access but partner airline SkyTeam Elite Plus get access. Because they know that their policy sucks compared to the rest of the world. 

Tired of the filth plaguing these lounges. Yes, I am a classist. Thank you.",0,1747929749.0,delta,19,0.24,False
1ksuf2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ksuf2n/aita_for_being_a_snitch_to_my_sister/,"AITA for being a ""snitch"" to my sister?","Yesterday, my sister (20F) and I (19F) got into a heated argument, leading to some unpleasant exchanges. we never really got along even when we were little kids, but it recently turned more hostile towards me as i go towards my degree in vet science and in art history, calling me selfish for getting a degree while she stays at home. We have the funds to send both of us to schooling; she never seems to have the proper motivation to get a job or a degree, though.

The reason why I mention this festering hatred towards me is because when I was younger (14 or so), I was in an abusive relationship with my then 16-year-old boyfriend; it was a lot, but the most notable fact right now is that when I tried to leave, he threatened to murder me, and because of shitty luck on my end, I was accused of ""encouraging"" the murder attempt and sent to a mental institution as a result. My sister never really cared about my life, as mentioned before, and never noticed that I was missing the whole time (I was gone for half a month). My parents, trying to cover this, would even write fake letters from her that they would bring to my visits to keep my morale up. It worked until I mentioned my stay to her 3 years later, her not even knowing what I was talking about, which broke my heart, honestly.

Now it's the present, and we had an argument last night while she was on the phone with her friend. Mid-argument, she hit me with ""Kill yourself! oh wait, you already tried and thats why you were sent to the ward!"". I froze, and I told her that I never even did try to do that in the first place, to which she brushed off with ""Oh, well you were still sent there anyway, freak."". Here's where I might be the asshole: I called my mom, and I told her about what she said, which resulted in my sister being screamed at on the phone a few minutes later. My sister tried justifying the incident by saying, ""She mentioned my teeth first!"" (We both have snaggle teeth, and it was a joking comment I made a week ago.) ""Why does she always get away with things because she's younger than me!""

And then, after she got off the phone with Mom, she called back her friend and proceeded to dump the whole history of my abuse from my ex on her. She made herself the victim by saying, ""She's too old to be crying back to Mommy the second something good doesn't happen in her life!""

She's down the hall from my room, so I heard all of this while my current boyfriend was comforting me on the phone, as he knows that I have severe trauma from the incident. My mom scolded me when she got home, saying I was to blame ""because I should've known this was going to happen"" and I ""need to be the bigger person"" in the end. My dad didn't help either, as he took my (now crying) sister to her favorite coffee place and is now taking her to the movies today to cheer her up.

Also I love you Charlotte me and my best friend watch you all the time (also all names have been changed) (also sorry it's long)
For a little context me (21F) met my best friend ""callie"" (23F) when we were in high-school as she was friends with my ex but me and her had a better connection then him and her did so after the break up she dropped him and we have been best friends since. My little sister ""jen"" (19F) has ALWAYS had an issue with Callie since she met her( no one actually knows why) but my family has always included her in our family events as Callie and her mom don't have the best relationship. Me and Callie have done everything together for years now we even welcomed baby girls into the world 8 months apart so they have grown up together mine Lisa (4F) hers  Jessica(3F) and even navigated being young single mothers together. Callie is a truly strong, beautiful, caring and overall an amazing person. Callie dose do this thing where she just drops off the face of the earth for days on end which I've never found an issue because she is a single mother and a welder so she dose get busy. Callie has never been a person to start conflict so when Jen would make comments about Callies weight, her job or the fact she thinks she looks like a man she stays silent but I always tell Jen ""shut up and get away from her, you have no right to speak to her that way"" then Jen would laugh and walk away (Jen is like this with EVERYONE even the family) so I have a pretty short fuse with her comments as I've been subjected to them my whole life and my parents say ""shes a little girl she doesn't know any better"" which has enabled her to just become a total monster  so much so her and my parents bullied me into letting her and her boyfriend (21M) live with me (I'm a very bad people pleaser)
Our story starts on a Thursday morning when I get a panicked call from Callie asking if she can come over she ""has something to tell me"" so I tell Callie to come over so we can talk and she shows up completely flustered crying and all so I make her coffee, give her a hug and sit her at the table. This is when she tells me ""I have breast cancer"" is a small sad voice (her aunt qnd grandmother died from breast cancer less then a year after being diagnosed) which made me also break down in tears with her and hold her repeating ""we can do this I will do anything to help you and Jessica any way you need"". As me and Callie are crying and hugging Jen comes out of her room laughing about hiw we look like homosexuals when Callie tells her ""Jen I have breast cancer"" hopping for the family support me and the rest of my family gives her with everything else. When Jen says probably the worst thing I will ever hear ""Finally I don't have to deal with you or that stupid kid anymore, you deserve it"" while laughing like a complete psychopath.which made Callie cry and go into a ball, I completely lose my mind screaming at her that she is an evil no good person and finally smacking her across the face and kicking her out of my house and told her ""get as close to moms house as you can before I actually kill you"" (I'm not a violent person in the slightest) but she made me more mad then I thought was possible then locked the door behind her qnd her boyfriend looking  back at Callie qnd telling her I will pick up the girls from daycare and we are having a movie and junk food Daytona turning off my phone. The next day while Callie and the girls were sleeping in my room I called my older brother Jerry (24M) telling him what happened yesterday (he qnd Callie were very good friends in high-school) qnd telling him I need him to help me move Jens stuff out of My house as she is no longer welcome in my home or around me. He agrees and 5 minutes later is at my front door with a basket of flowers candy and all of callies favorite things to leave on the table for her, then we get to boxing all of Jens stuff up which he drops off on my parents front yard with a note telling her she is no longer welcome near my home. This set my parents into a frenzie where they call my qt least 40 times each and when I answer they tell me ""jen didn't mean it, you can't kick her out of your house"" I rebutted with ""you raised that spawn of Satan you can keep her after showing me what a monster she can be I no longer want her here"" (I pay for my house so I have all right to kick her out) and hung up. I have dealt with her abuse my whole life qnd have probably enabled her to be that way by putting up with it but I was no longer doing that. Since then Jen has decided to divide my family by telling them ""I'd never say that she is being dramatic"" and everyone that believes her has been sending me hateful messages that ""we don't treat family that way"" and that I'm stressing my parents out by cutting off my sister with no desire to ever speak to her again.

1ksu87u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1ksu87u/im_so_fucking_stupid/,I'm so fucking stupid.,"Back in 2023, I've had an active Game Pass subscription and bought in a crazy Microsoft Store sale, what I've thought at the time, the Deluxe version of DOOM Eternal. Everything looked cool, DLC and bunch of skins unlocked, didn't play the DLC because I was burnt out and went on to play other stuff. Oh boy was I wrong.

Fast-forward 2 years and this week, at a tuesday, I've wanted to replay Doom Eternal. ""Oh, I'm gonna download the copy I've bought on Microsoft Store!"". Download finished, coffee in hand and as I gaze to the monitor, I go: ""Wait, why is only the DLC unlocked?"". I search the Xbox app if the Campaign portion was downloaded, everything looked in order. The Campaign can't be purchased by itself, so I go ""looks good to me"". Repair install, redownload, nada, nothing worked. ""Ok, I have to look my purchase history"" and after fighting with Microsoft in order to login into my Outlook account, there it was, ""Doom Eternal Year One Pass."" 

Devastated and ashamed, I find out that I needed to buy the Standard Edition of the game. I go to the Microsoft Store and see how much is the base game, ""Surely there's a deal to coincide with Dark Ages' laun-"", $40. I give up and shamefully uninstall Doom Eternal. Two days later, today, I look into a general discounts roundup website here in Brazil and there was a huge sale for a Microsoft Store key of the game in a shady website. Now, I don't condone buying stuff of these shady keys websites but I was kinda desperate and had to look into it and... it was sold out. 

Looking at the comments of the discount post someone goes ""People are so scummy selling their Prime keys"" and I go ""Wait a minute, Amazon Prime gave the game out??"" and that's when it hit me: [I gave my Microsoft Store Doom Eternal key away](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/1g0nq87/prime_gaming_doom_eternal_bioshock_remastered/lrahzak/), thinking I had the complete game with all DLCs back in 2024.

She briefly glanced at me, did a quick hair flip, blushed red, then quickly turned to look the other way.

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Err, eye contact is obviously a good sign but I really can't tell that Vivian is into me. She could just be adjusting her hair, and maybe she was looking at someone else besides me.

So, I was inside a Hollow gathering intel from data points while my cute agent partner Vivian is standing really close to me making sure her Proxy is safe and sound. And Vivian says ""Wow! Do you think you could go any slower?"" and then playfully and gently punches my arm.

Is she really into Lord Phaethon? Err, again, you can't really tell from this example either. She might like me but she might just be giggling and punching my arm as a sarcastic noblewoman throwback, so really no way to tell.

Okay, so I was at the gym on the elliptical and Cutie McBooty comes in and gets on the exercise bike in front of me and then after 5 minutes she looks back and says ""Wow, I'm so sweaty already. If only there were a way to get the same workout at Random Play riding something else"". Then gives me a wink.

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Yeah, still can't tell with this one... Ummm, exercise equipment is pretty expensive and maybe Vivian lives in a small apartment and just doesn't have space. So, maybe I can find a good deal on exercise machines somewhere and I can show her the flyer.

Okay, so one day in Lumina Square I happen to miraculously bump into Vivian who I had coffee and drinks with a couple of times and she says ""I had a lot of fun on the last few dates we went on"". That's a good sign, because she thought those quality hangouts were actually dates. So then she says ""How'd you like to go back to Random Play and watch video tapes tonight?"". That's another good sign. Errr, it's usually a pretty good indicator when an agent invites you to do something, especially at the HDD room in Random Play. So then, later at Random Play, me and Vivian are watching ""Oh\~ Sweetie"" or something like that, and she says ""I'm getting pretty bored. Why don't you come upstairs with me?"". That's another great sign. Vivian probably has something pretty interesting to do upstairs in Random Play if it's better than watching ""Oh\~ Sweetie"". So, then after we go up there, all of a sudden Vivian pushes me onto my warm bed, dims the lights, rips off her clothes, and we start having seggs.

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Yeah again, I really can't be too sure. It's pretty dark in the room, so she can't really see me properly. Maybe Vivian is from Canada and was just being polite. Anyway, best bet is to just keep my wits about me and continue to look for signs that Vivian really likes Lord Phaethon.",10,1747928727.0,ZZZ_Discussion,3,0.71,False

* Others are deep into knowledge graphs and structured relationships
* Some are trying to solve it with bigger context windows
* Episodic vs semantic memory debate

I wonder if some people are just calling retrieval ""memory"" bc it sounds more impressive. But if we think of human memory, then it should be messy and associative. Is that what we want, though? Or do we want it to be more clean and structured like a db? Do we want it to ""remember"" our coffee order or just use a really good lookup system (and is there a difference???)

These are some jokes he's said at work:

Are you sure this coffee isn't yours, it tastes like you.

When there was a creak in the floor, he said ""At one point, your parents made this noise""

An 18yo staff member said to him that he has really bad eyebags. And he said ""I'll teabag your eye bags"". I didn't know what teabag was, but he said it in a sensual manner, so I google searched what teabag definition is, and it's very inappropriate. 

He said to me ""I don't mean to go full on ghost with you, but it's like this"", and then he put his hand on top of my hand to show me how to grind a coarse cream with a spatula. Then he proceeded to move my hand from left to right vice versa to show me the grinding motion.

On another occasion, I had to push down on an object to click the lid into place. He put his hand on top of my hand for 2 seconds and then took his hand off. Then I pushed my hand down and clicked the lid into place.

When I was stacking shelves, I looked to the right and saw him looking at my legs up and down. I was wearing baggy pants, so I didn't see anything appealing about my legs. But he looked it up and down really really slowly.

And then once I was talking to him at a table and we were both sitting down, I went to lean back on my chair but I misjudged how far back the back of the chair was. So thst mean I was leaning back quite more than usual for a few seconds. He looked down at my chest area, with his mouth gaping open and his eyes half open and just stared at them for a few seconds. Then he looked up like nothing happened and kept on talking like normal.

Once I was tying my hair up in front of the mirror and then he came into the room and it was only a few seconds later that i realised he was looking down the sleeve of my t shirt. I didn't realise the arm of my t shirt was quite wide, enough for him to look down my t shirt sleeve. I didn't shave my armpits because I didn't think anyone would be looking at them. So I he really hairy armpits. I then stepped back and then he got out of his daze and went on to do something else. He left the room and I was dreading walking out of the room to go to work. I thought he'd tell the staff members I had hairy armpits but he didn't. Phew.

He's 7 years older than me. But he calls me ""good girl"" a lot.

He did all these things and I had only started working there and we barely knew each other. Which means he probably says inappropriate things to other staff members too.

He's got an excellent LinkedIn and instagram, he writes magazine articles in the industry we work in, He's prominent in the industry, he's close with the president and vice president of the organisation. He says he's hobbies are updating his LinkedIn and instagram, which means he's all about appearances and image. 

He looks really happy on social media. But in real life, he looks sad, stressed and sometimes he gets really angry and bursts out in rage for the entire day. Then he's completely normal the next day. He's really nice but then is really mean and then nice again and then mean again. It's a cycle.

Edit: a lot of staff members really like him. He doesn't say inappropriate jokes to older staff members. He only says it to younger female staff members. He also has pretty privilege. He's 30yo, but he keeps saying over and over again that he's 6 foot 3 and that he's a big guy. Isn't it lame that someone that age keeps mentioning their height and that they're big? Especially in front of staff members who are mainly short (e.g. me and the staff members are around 5 foot 2).",1,1747928561.0,workplace_bullying,3,0.6,False

**Why This Pick?**

German Marquez has been pretty brutal on the mound for Colorado, friends. At 1-6 with an ERA of 8.78, Philadelphia should have no issue putting runs in the bag. In addition, two of Philly starter Ranger Suarez’s last outings have seen game totals of at least 12 runs. Like all of the games in this series so far, this encounter should see plenty of runs on the board. Take the Over to hit.

I am an avid reader and coffee drinker who is looking for a treat day out, buying in some new books and grabbing a coffee and a sweet treat. 

I want to go to a book shop or two that is not a Waterstones, and I want to grab coffee somewhere that is now Mow’s, Bird’s Yard or Marmadukes. 

I love a cappuccino or a matcha, and doughnuts and croissants. Anything pistachio or coffee and/or nut flavoured is invited. 

Ideally I want somewhere that I can have my drink and read at my book at. Noise is not a big deal because I listen to classic music via headphones when I read anyway. 

Really fancy a doughnut to be honest though, so anywhere that does both would be great. I have heard of Joe’s - anybody been there?

Ever thought about what happens to your **cryptocurrency** or those countless **social media accounts** you’ve sprinkled your life on when you retire? It’s like the digital version of leaving a party—who’s going to clean up after you? 

As we gear up for the golden years, it’s easy to think about beach vibes and long strolls, but let’s not forget about the *digital footprints* we leave behind. Here are some quick tips to ensure your digital legacy is as smooth as coconut oil on a sunny day:

### **1. Inventory Your Digital Life**  
Just like we check our savings before splurging on *that* luxury cruise, we need to know what we have online. 

- **Crypto Wallets**: Where are they stored? Are they tied to an email?  
- **Social Media**: Facebook, Insta, Twitter—who’s got access?  
- **Other Accounts**: Think subscriptions, gaming accounts, maybe even a blog!  

### **2. Know Your Heirs**  
Your cousin, who still thinks Facebook is the newest thing, might not be the best bet for inheriting your crypto.  

- **Choose Wisely**: Designate someone tech-savvy and trustworthy.  
- **Share Access**: Maybe not giving them your password, but showing them how to access your accounts is a good start.  

### **3. Legalize It**  
So, we often ignore the boring stuff until it’s too late, right? But making a plan doesn’t have to be daunting!

- **Create a Will**: Yup, digital assets can be included. Shocking, I know!  
- **Power of Attorney**: This can help your loved ones manage your assets if you become unable to.  

### **4. Security is Key**  
In the digital jungle, you need to protect your treasures like Smaug!

- **Strong Passwords**: Toss the “password123” out the window. Use a password manager if that’s your jam.  
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Because one layer of protection is *so* last season.

### **5. Prepare for the Unexpected**  
Life can throw curveballs—like that time I spilled coffee on my laptop (oops!).

- **Digital Will**: Yes, they exist! Consult with a lawyer about including your digital assets in your will. It’s totally a thing now.  
- **Last Words**: Leave a heartfelt message for your nearest and dearest online. You might just give them something to chuckle at while they figure out your Pinterest board.   

Remember: **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** 😂 Check out this handy tool to help you visualize your road to retirement bliss [here](https://try.sunsama.com/gdnn6ll0lczp). 

It can feel like a lot, but taking these steps can help our loved ones remember the good times without a headache over social media posts or crypto values.

1kstplb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dryalcoholics/comments/1kstplb/35_days/,35 days,"Sorry for the long Dear Diary-esque post. 

35 days and I’m visiting my family in Utah. Almost the first thing my dad asked when we got back to the house (it was about 3:30 in the afternoon) was if I wanted a small glass of wine. I ALMOST said yes but then instead told them I was 35 days sober and I wasn’t drinking and he asked me to pretend he hadn’t asked which was sweet. 
Then last night as I’m scouring my old bedroom to see if I left anything from the last trip I could bring home I found a bottle of almost finished Grey Goose hidden in the laundry hamper. Clearly no one has been in my old room for about a year and a half so no one would be any the wiser if I took a shot or two. Instead I went upstairs and gave the bottle to my parents and apologized because I clearly stole it from them the last time I visited when I was still drinking. They weren’t upset and poured the remainder of the bottle down the sink.
This morning I woke up and went upstairs to make coffee and opened the wine fridge they have by the coffee maker. One small swig would go unnoticed and after 35 days sober I might end up with a nice buzz from a swallow of wine or two. I shut the fridge, grabbed my coffee, and went back downstairs to journal and start my morning sober and keep my 35 days streak intact.
I love my family and it’s always good to see them but I’ve been here less than 24 hours and I’ve already been triggered to drink 3 times. My family is big on drinking but they can moderate unlike me. I just hope they don’t feel like they can’t drink around me because they certainly can. 
I thought the longer I went the easier it would get but the cravings are strong this week. I leave Sunday and although I’m going to miss my family when I fly out I need to get out of this environment. This house and frankly, this state, is where my drinking really took off when I was younger so it’s not easy being back here and seeing all the bars and restaurants I used to get wasted at with my sisters and friends. 
On the other side of the coin, I’m not sure I’ve ever enjoyed SLC without a drink in my hand so maybe being here sober will help me to enjoy the city in a new and healthy way.

Since setting up the meet and greet to today, I have noticed more signs of separation anxiety when I leave her to run an errand or pick up a coffee (pawing at the door, whining, pacing), but none of these trips have been longer than 30 min to an hour so I'm unsure if it's uneasiness and she would eventually settle down. I have also shared this info with the adopter in an effort to be transparent.

My concern is that the adopter will need to leave her to go to work and the separation anxiety will be a lot for everyone and this dog will end up back at the shelter. I will admit I am very emotionally invested in this foster, more than I have normally, I think b/c of her shy nature. She has made huge huge huge improvements in just a short time with me.

I was just casually walking around the mall after buying my usual pack of boxer shorts when I happened to come across a GameStop.

It went in and the sales person told me there is currently a $15 sale on games.  I told him I was interested and he proceeded to print out a list of games in his store of all the games that qualify for the sale.

I checked off a few items on the list.

The Alfred Hitchcock and Tintin games look interesting.  I didn't know games were being made for those IP.

I heard that Trek to Yomi and the Coffee Talk games got some good word of mouth.

There a few I have never heard of like Anonymous Code, Loop8, Potionomics, and Smile For Me.  However, at $15 dollars a limited/collector's edition feels like a bargain.  The Nuclear Blaze one even comes with a keychain.

I think I might go to another GameStop tomorrow to see if they might have other games that the GameStop I visited did not have.",0,1747927749.0,gamecollecting,1,0.5,False

These are the foods and drinks that I absolutely swear by, I have most of these 5-7x a week. 

The number one thing that I would absolutely swear by is the meat sticks, one stick is less than 100 cal, has a decent amount of protein and makes me feel full but not stuffed and gives me a good amount of energy, if you’re looking for a good snack, I would definitely recommend the No Mans Land brand then the Archer brand. 

And with the bacon, it can be any bacon, it doesn’t have to be that particular brand. The great thing about bacon is it’s zero carb or very, very low carb. You can get a couple of pieces for not too many calories, it’s filling, and it’s delicious! I mean who doesn’t love bacon!?

I know everyone’s surgeon/dietitian has given them different guidelines so some of these may not seem right for you, but they’re all in line for me. I have no calorie restrictions, I’m supposed to have 70 g of protein a day, and no more than 50 carbs a day (that includes net carbs). 

If anyone has any foods/drinks that are an absolute must for you, please share them! I always like to try something new! 😊

“Just closed on a lake house. So blessed.”

“Front row seats to the concert. #Blessed”

“My latte art came out perfect today. Feeling blessed!”

At this point, the word “blessed” might need a support group.

In the biblical imagination, being “blessed” usually looks like wandering the wilderness, being poor in spirit, mourning, being persecuted, or carrying a cross, not necessarily sipping a macchiato with flawless foam.

Don’t get me wrong, lake houses and latte art are lovely. But when Jesus opened his Sermon on the Mount, he didn’t say, “Blessed are the homeowners,” or “Blessed are the well-caffeinated.” He said:
“Blessed are the meek.”
“Blessed are those who mourn.”
“Blessed are the peacemakers.”

It’s almost as if blessing has less to do with lifestyle upgrades and more to do with the strange peace that sneaks in when everything else falls apart.

So maybe let’s be careful not to shrink the word. “Blessed” isn’t just a humblebrag in disguise. It’s a deep, defiant joy that sometimes shows up not in having more, but in losing well, loving hard, and finding God in the cracks.

Just a thought from someone still grateful for his coffee but trying to remember what blessing really means.",4,1747927490.0,Christianity,1,1.0,False

1ksthpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1ksthpi/back_with_an_update_tokie_now_supports_google/,Back with an update: Tokie now supports Google Docs editing inside folders locally,"Hey everyone,

About 6 weeks ago I shared Tokie, a desktop file manager I’ve been building that turns your folders into documents, databases, and even mini browsers.

Since then, I’ve been working on a new and exciting feature — support for Google Drive, with native editing of Google Docs right inside the app.

[Google Doc files can only preview the icon not the content inside Finder](https://preview.redd.it/dbwhyzjioc2f1.jpg?width=1764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=504df2d00a41a93a181117e00e372a7159edeeee)

The experience of using Google Doc files inside Finder is limited, every time you want to check out the content of a file or edit it, it opens a tab in your browser, and over time you lose track between the file and the tab.

Unlike Finder, which just shows a static icon for Google Docs and opens a separate browser tab, Tokie now lets you:

* **Open and edit Google Docs directly inside your folder view in the side peek panel**
* See the content instantly without switching apps or browser windows
* Keep your workflow focused — especially useful if you manage a lot of cloud-based files alongside local ones

Here’s a quick comparison of Tokie

[Goog docs editor will load in the side peek panel after you click on them.](https://preview.redd.it/xnxj5z7voc2f1.jpg?width=1764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ccabae7ac8bca451088a07fbd4a8b5e155a3ed6)

You click on any Google Doc files, whether it is the Doc, the Slides or the Sheets, they the file will load in the preview, and you will be able to edit them instantly.

For the first time, you might need to login (may be occasionally later on), and next time you open it, it will go straight to the editor.

A few folks from reddit messaged me and actually asked about this, and I hope this meets your expectations.



>With the recent update, we also added support for **multi-file select + drag-and-drop**, which makes reorganizing large folders feel much more like a modern native app.

>Also, we supported Intel devices.



If you tried Tokie before, I’d love to hear what you think of this update. And if you decided not to buy it, what was the reason, do you think that is something we can improve on to change your mind? Would love these feedbacks!



And if you haven’t heard about [Tokie.is](http://Tokie.is) , apart from whats mentioned in this post, Tokie is a Finder alternative on Mac(for now), that turns your folders into databases, and lets you customise content layout inside a folder with inline preview markdown editors and widgets.

Happy to answer any questions or take feedback — still actively building and improving based on what you all find useful.

I was in Seattle from Saturday morning to Wednesday night, originally arriving to catch Underworld play at the SODO Showbox and visit a few friends. Here is a short list of some of the other highlights of the trip in no particular order, but vaguely chronologically.

- Taking the 1 line and seeing all the murals around Stadium and SODO.
- Finding two tickets to see the Lambrini Girls who tore it up at the Baba Yaga.
- Visiting the Connections Museum -- what an absolute gem. All the volunteers were incredibly nice and informative on a wide history of communication technology.
- Finding two Lauren YS murals in the International district.
- Getting a new tattoo from Meg @Punkyweed tattoo.
- Having a drink at the Arctic Club Hotel and getting to take a peak at the ballroom.
- Ghostfish brewing.
- The artist who makes creatures and faces using CD's on telephone poles.
- Visiting the old Union Station.
- Strolling through the University of Washington campus.
- Having a sit down in the quiet wing of the Suzzallo Library.
- Biking over to Gas Works park and dodging all the goose shit.
- Saying hello to the Freemont and Ballard Trolls.
- Coffee on the Freemont Coffee Company balcony.
- Ballard Locks and especially seeing the nesting blue herons.
- Ferry ride to Bainbridge.
- Saying hello to Pia the Peacekeeper and Frog Rock.
- Bay Hay and Feed shirt.
- Fay Bainbridge park.
- Visiting KEXP.
- Strolling Alki Beach.
- Underworld at Showbox -- Wow.
- Finding Bruun Idun.
- Pouring over and adding to the wheat paste collection near the gum wall.
- L'Oursin
- All the Art Nouveau aesthetic.

I'm sure I'm missing a handful of other little adventures we got up to on the short visit. The weather was a perfect combination of stormy, windy, sunny, and warm -- depending on the hour.

If I'm blessed with making a return trip there are a few more trolls I have to find and I completely forgot to search for Kyler Martz murals and artwork that might be in the city.

**\*Note: If this game gets rained out, I'll send out another... But this pitching matchup was too good to resist lol.**



**Why This Pick?**

This is a bold pick – I’ll admit. Despite the Orioles offense being lukewarm (okay, often ice cold…), I don’t love either pitcher on the mound today. The Red Sox offense should run all over Cade Povich (5.23 ERA) – and despite Baltimore’s struggles, they should be able to get more than a few past Lucas Giolito (7.08 ERA). I fully expect both the Orioles and the Red Sox to have runs on the board before the 3rd inning starts. I’m on the Over to cash today for plus money, friends.

She briefly glanced at me, did a quick hair flip, blushed red, then quickly turned to look the other way.

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Err, eye contact is obviously a good sign but I really can't tell that Vivian is into me. She could just be adjusting her hair, and maybe she was looking at someone else besides me.



So, I was inside a Hollow gathering intel from data points while my cute agent partner Vivian is standing really close to me making sure her Proxy is safe and sound. And Vivian says ""Wow! Do you think you could go any slower?"" and then playfully and gently punches my arm.

Is she really into Lord Phaethon? Err, again, you can't really tell from this example either. She might like me but she might just be giggling and punching my arm as a sarcastic noblewoman throwback, so really no way to tell.



Okay, so I was at the gym on the elliptical and Cutie McBooty comes in and gets on the exercise bike in front of me and then after 5 minutes she looks back and says ""Wow, I'm so sweaty already. If only there were a way to get the same workout at Random Play riding something else"". Then gives me a wink.

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Yeah, still can't tell with this one... Ummm, exercise equipment is pretty expensive and maybe Vivian lives in a small apartment and just doesn't have space. So, maybe I can find a good deal on exercise machines somewhere and I can show her the flyer.



Okay, so one day in Lumina Square I happen to miraculously bump into Vivian who I had coffee and drinks with a couple of times and she says ""I had a lot of fun on the last few dates we went on"". That's a good sign, because she thought those quality hangouts were actually dates. So then she says ""How'd you like to go back to Random Play and watch video tapes tonight?"". That's another good sign. Errr, it's usually a pretty good indicator when an agent invites you to do something, especially at the HDD room in Random Play. So then, later at Random Play, me and Vivian are watching ""Oh\~ Sweetie"" or something like that, and she says ""I'm getting pretty bored. Why don't you come upstairs with me?"". That's another great sign. Vivian probably has something pretty interesting to do upstairs in Random Play if it's better than watching ""Oh\~ Sweetie"". So, then after we go up there, all of a sudden Vivian pushes me onto my warm bed, dims the lights, rips off her clothes, and we start having seggs. 

Is Vivian really into Lord Phaethon? Yeah again, I really can't be too sure. It's pretty dark in the room, so she can't really see me properly. Maybe Vivian is from Canada and was just being polite. Anyway, best bet is to just keep my wits about me and continue to look for signs that Vivian really likes Lord Phaethon.",3,1747927054.0,ZenlessZoneZero,2,0.71,False

Let’s ease into the weekend. Pick a cozy little lounge—somewhere dimly lit, with soft music and that kind of vibe where it’s easy to lose track of time in conversation. Just a couple of drinks, no pressure, just seeing how we vibe. If the chemistry’s right, we’ll wander off to a spot with great food and even better ambiance. I’m talking shareable dishes, low-key flirting, and maybe a few stories that make us laugh until the drinks hit.

If we’re feeling it from the day before, maybe we meet up again mid-afternoon next day for something chill—think a walk through an art market, grab brunch and find a trail to wander, or a spot by the water to just sit and talk about everything and nothing or grab coffee and see where the day takes us.

i’ve been building stuff for a few years now — a few mini startups, some solo content projects, and a lot of half-finished experiments.



and throughout all of it… i’ve mostly been alone.



no community. no peers. no one to say “yeah bro, that happens to me too.”



i’ve had people older than me give advice, but rarely someone my age who’s also in the trenches — building something after school or skipping sleep to figure out landing pages.



it gets lonely.



so last week, i started a small experiment: a Discord server for teen entrepreneurs & creators (14–22).



not a course. not a startup incubator. not a “daily motivation” server.



just a space to:

• share wins

• vent struggles

• swap tools, feedback, maybe even collab



it’s 48 members strong in 5 days. super early, but kinda magical already.



not dropping a link here.

\- yoga/wellness (yoga teacher training program)

\- counseling (MSW?)

Just looking for some advice on how to go about choosing a field and then a solid program in that field. 

Would love to hear your experiences and what you decided to do with your education benefits.

Testing the Silonn SLIM24B Nugget Ice Maker has been an interesting experience. This compact machine has quickly gained a spot on my kitchen counter, providing the kind of chewable ice that elevates drinks to a new level. With its sleek design and impressive functionality, the product promises much but also has its quirks.

Its modern and stylish appearance caught my attention immediately. The black exterior paired with its compact dimensions (12.83"" D x 14.88"" W x 10.12"" H) ensures that it doesn’t occupy too much counter space. At just over 20 pounds, it's portable enough to move around if needed, yet sturdy enough that it feels well-made. Many guests have commented on how professional it looks, neatly blending into my kitchen appliances.  

**Performance That Surprised Me**

I’ve had ice makers in the past, but nothing has quite matched the speed and efficiency of this machine. Starting up in under six minutes, it produces soft, chewable nugget ice that’s perfect for cocktails, iced coffee, or even just a cold glass of water. Its daily output of 33 pounds of ice far exceeded my needs, but it came in handy during family gatherings and parties. The fast production cycle means no running to the nearest gas station for bagged ice—it’s like having freshly chilled convenience on demand.

*Don’t wait—[Check Silonn SLIM24B price on Amazon](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cd2c8m4d/).*

**How It Works (And How Easy It Is)**

Operating this ice maker is straightforward thanks to its intuitive controls. The single-button operation simplifies everything, and the status indicators on the front make life easier. Whether it’s actively producing or in need of cleaning, I didn’t have to hover around constantly to monitor it. There’s even a self-cleaning mode—this was honestly one of my favorite features since it saved me from the dreaded maintenance that similar machines often require. When I wanted to deep-clean it manually, the detachable top added some convenience.

However, I noticed the machine could get a little noisy during operation. While not obtrusively loud, it's worth mentioning for anyone sensitive to sound.

**Advantages**

- Compact and stylish design fits seamlessly into a variety of spaces.
- Produces nugget ice in just six minutes, meeting high demands during events.
- Simple button interface with easy-to-read status indicators.
- Includes a self-cleaning mode, reducing long-term maintenance.
- Soft, chewable ice perfect for drinks, chilling beer, or even packing food.

**Powerful Features but Room for Improvement**

The countertop device boasts many features, but there are some areas that felt slightly underwhelming. The ice basket included in the package is functional but could be a bit larger for heavy use. Similarly, the machine itself doesn’t keep the ice frozen for long once built up, and you’ll need to transfer it to a freezer if you’ve made a large batch.

**Select Areas of Concern**

- Occasional noise, noticeable in a quiet room.
- Limited ice-retention capabilities, requiring timely usage or storage.
- The ice basket’s size may not meet the needs of users with high consumption.

**Competing Products**

In comparison to similar nugget ice makers on the market, this model holds its own but also has challengers. Machines like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 or Frigidaire EFIC235 boast similar functionality, yet often come at a steeper price point. What sets the Silonn SLIM24B apart is its emphasis on simplicity and accessibility, coupled with its self-cleaning mode. The Opal 2.0, for example, shines with its larger ice storage capabilities, but it lacks the same price-to-value ratio, in my opinion. If elegance and advanced features aren’t your priority, the Silonn might strike the perfect balance.

**Affordable Quality**

After testing several similar products, I can see the value the Silonn offers. Its range of features and reliable ice production makes it a practical solution without emptying your wallet on high-end competitors. Whether for casual daily use or social events, investing in this ice maker feels like one of those smart appliance choices that’ll keep giving back over time.

No frills, no nonsense. A bed, a kettle, and a window — sometimes that’s all you need.  
If you’re visiting London and don’t want your wallet to file for bankruptcy in Zone 1, Hackney is the place. It has... a vibe. The kind that feels slightly unhinged in the best way.

# What I Ate:

* **Falafel & Lamb Wrap** from a tiny joint at the **Mare Street junction**  £5, tastes like £10, and the guy behind the counter insists on adding extra toppings “just because.” God bless him.
* **Perfect Chicken** – late night saviour. Their chicken sandwich is exactly what it says on the box: perfect. Smash burger was okay. I didn’t get the hype. My wife said it was excellent, so now it’s excellent.
* **Chan’s Noodle Bar** – Delicious. Cheap. Proper food. They only take cash though, which in 2025 feels like a minor protest.
* **Pallette** – Cosy spot. Food was good, slightly more expensive than expected for Hackney. Coffee was great. Also cash-only. Maybe Hackney's running a secret anti-card movement.
* **Hackney Church Brew Co.** – Went on a Thursday. Good deals, good beers. But the standout was **Lagom** — their food feels like something you’d find in a place with two vowels in the name and a three-month waiting list. Excellent.

Also, witnessed **shoplifting** inside **Sainsbury’s Hackney Central** . A guy ran out with a few boxes of Ariel or Tide who gives a damn, someone shouted, no one chased. Another guy followed us asking for food. Hackney's full of characters — not unsafe, just real.

**Special mention:**  
Walked past **Oslo** on Saturday night. Looked like a scene from a BBC Three show. Cool people, neon light, good noise. We didn’t go — too tired and had an early train to Edinburgh.

They say no to coffee and alcohol like it’s the hill they’re going to die on—but then turn around and do ketamine therapy like it’s no big deal. I’m not judging the ketamine, but come on… if the Word of Wisdom is sacred, shouldn’t all substances count?

Then there’s the constant talk about “loving like Jesus,” which sounds great… until you see the backstabbing, cold shoulders, and zero forgiveness when someone steps out of line. It’s less “love thy neighbor” and more “gossip about thy neighbor in a group chat.”

And the whole “we’re going to change the church” thing? How? Where? They’re not writing books, not starting movements, not even organizing thoughtful discussions. Just vague statements and designer outfits. If you’re not actually doing the work, can you really claim the mission?

It just feels like they’re using “Mormon” as a label, but not living anything close to what it actually means—either culturally or spiritually. And honestly, it comes across as hypocritical more than anything.

1kssr5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/KarenReadTrial/comments/1kssr5s/working_backwards_from_the_head_injury/,Working backwards from the head injury,"*Warning: this post discusses injuries to, and potential violent reasons for, JOKs skull in some detail*


Visually, it looks like JOKs head injury could have come from many things. A strike with an object - or a fall against a surface with an edge or ridge - appear possible if not likely. 

The underlying skull fracture was diagnosed as ‘non-depressed’. This points more in the direction of a blunt object, as the fracture didn’t present as sunken in. Falling backward and hitting the ground/floor,  or a being hit with wide piece of something like wood, seems more likely based on this ‘non-depressed’ fracture. In any event there was still bridging in the underlying tissue which continues to rule out a focal strike from something like a bat ot a ridged object. 

The damage observed to the front of the brain, resulting in ‘raccoon eyes’, reveals that the injury is a ‘coup contrecoup’ brain injury. The force of the impact thrust the brain forward toward the eye sockets. 

This is a signature injury from a backward fall against a *stationary, hard surface* - especially when coupled with the non-depressed fracture. 

_____

At this point we’re down to JOK falling backward and striking his head on the ground or the floor. Less possible might be a coffee table. 

So let’s look at the other data to locate the area that this injury occurred: 

- Every high confidence GPS pinpoint places the phone in the area of the flagpole.

- JOKs last movement of his phone was 12:32:16am iOS time.  

- After no steps, use or movement, JOKs phone entered pocket state at 12:33:14am and remained there until 6:15:01am (iOS time)

- The temperature in [Canton on 1/29/22 at midnight](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/norwood/KOWD/date/2022-1-29) was about 30F and dropping. JOKs phone’s battery remained 20-25 degrees warmer than the ambient air until 6:14, when it suddenly dropped from 43F to 37F. This would reflect the time JOK was rolled off of his phone. 

____

Based on the above we can safely deduce that JOKs phone never moved from where it was at 12:32:16. 

And the cell data strongly suggests JOKs body was shielding the phone from the ambient air until he was found and rolled off his phone. 

____

I believe it’s beyond any reasonable doubt that JOKs head injury occurred in the *very* close vicinity of where he was found. 

And his last movement was closely tied to his phone’s last movement at 12:32:16 (iOS time)

And KRs 1162.2 trigger event (detailing a trip in reverse down Fairview would have gone *right past JOKs final rest* in the middle of her ~70 foot trip. 

This trip ended between 12:32:04am and 12:32:12am (iOS time). 

4 seconds before JOKs phone stopped moving, and remained there undisturbed and *sheilded from the elements* until he was found.

How to dispel the common doubts that make people think that caffeine is healthy when it actually isn't?

**Answer :**

The caffeine industry has done an impressive job creating a health halo around what is fundamentally a drug dependency. Here's how to cut through the common myths:

**""But studies show coffee has antioxidants!""** This is like saying cigarettes are healthy because tobacco leaves contain some vitamins. The antioxidants in coffee are mostly destroyed by roasting, and you can get far superior antioxidants from berries, vegetables, and tea without the drug dependency. Plus, many coffee studies don't separate the effects of caffeine from other compounds.

**""It improves focus and performance!""** This is the addiction talking. Caffeine doesn't actually enhance your baseline performance—it temporarily reverses the withdrawal symptoms you've created. You feel ""focused"" because you're no longer in caffeine withdrawal. Non-users perform just as well without needing chemical assistance.

**""Everyone drinks it, so it must be safe!""** Everyone used to smoke too. Social acceptance doesn't equal health. We've normalized a drug dependency so thoroughly that people can't imagine functioning without it, which is actually a red flag, not reassurance.

**""I only have one cup a day!""** Even small amounts maintain the addiction cycle and disrupt sleep architecture. That ""one cup"" is still enough to block adenosine receptors for 6-8 hours and interfere with natural energy regulation.

**""But I feel terrible without it!""** That's withdrawal, not evidence that you need it. It's like saying alcohol is necessary because hangovers feel bad. The fact that you feel awful without caffeine proves you're dependent on a substance to feel normal.

**""Coffee is natural!""** So is poison ivy. ""Natural"" doesn't mean beneficial. Caffeine exists in plants as a pesticide to kill insects—it's literally a natural insecticide that we've convinced ourselves to consume daily.

The biggest mindset shift is recognizing that feeling ""normal"" only with caffeine means you're not actually normal—you're managing a drug dependency.",11,1747925657.0,decaf,7,0.92,False

My dad (who lives with me) has always been very fit and athletic; he was a firefighter for years. After he retired, he stopped being as active and gained weight. More recently, he and my mom moved in with my family. He suddenly got very hell-bent on the idea of losing weight. Which was fine at first - his doctor did advise him to do so. But he seems to have gone extreme. He doesn’t eat breakfast or lunch. He sometimes snacks on a handful of nuts or one bite of someone’s left over toast. Then he goes mountain bike riding for 20-30 miles. 

He’s lost the weight and then some. He often tells us he doesn’t feel well or is unusually cold (it’s 90’s in the desert right now). I think he also punishes himself when he does eat. We went out a few days ago and he had dinner (his only meal of the day), then he didn’t eat again until 5pm the next day - he only had a protein bar and coffee.  

He mentions his weight almost daily. Mostly in the context of how great he looks for his age. He obsesses over how much my mom eats (a normal amount) and will boast about how little he has eaten in comparison. 

He loves to cook. He cooks dinner for us a lot but then doesn’t eat it and claims he “snacked” on it while he made it. He refuses to sit down and eat, often choosing the stand at the counter while all of us are at the dinner table.

i have pots, and my cardiologist emphasized that snris are not compatible with my condition and could be exacerbating my symptoms. 

i have been on over 10 different psych meds (ssris, snris, anti psychotics, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, anti convulsants, etc.) over the past 12is years. i have severe major depressive disorder, gad, bpd, dpdr, and c-ptsd with dissociation. i am atp where i don’t think meds will help the severity of my psychopathology anymore. and yes i am in therapy.

i decided to taper off effexor with approval and supervision from my psychiatrist. i have missed doses here and there and knew the withdrawal would be difficult to overcome (brain zaps, irritability, sweats, headache, disorientation, SI, etc.) but i was NOT anticipating experiencing what has been going on the past two days. 

my psych instructed me to take 150mg for 1 wk, 75mg for 1 wk, 37.5mg for 1 wk, and then stop for a total of 3 wks tapering. i am on day two of 150mg (remember i had originally been taking 225mg) and i am a disaster. my dpdr and dissociation is a thousand times worse, i have no mental clarity, i have been acting out my dreams/nightmares and hearing voices/hallucinating. this morning i called out of work and fell back asleep after making coffee because i had a rough night, and i woke myself up to dumping my coffee all over my nightstand. i cannot stop shaking (i am not cold) and i feel extremely paranoid.

i am so scared to go thru this alone. my bf is unable to leave work early, his mom isn’t available to come stay with me, and those are the only two people i have in my support system that live nearby. well, i live with my bf, but his family lives about 20ish minutes away. i don’t feel safe to drive because brain zaps….if you know you know.

what even is there to do in this situation? i refuse to go back to taking 225mg. then i would have to go thru this process again in the future. this med has helped my depression but i have hit a plateau and i am not making progress anymore - not to mention physically i am unable to do most things due to the complexity of my symptoms. i suppose i could take 150mg plus a 37.5mg capsule; i think my psych is tapering me way too damn fast. 

i don’t think the ER would be appropriate, because the last time i had actually ran out was prior to a surgery and they would NOT give me more to tide me over until my next refill. this happened during a dose switch, hence why i ran out. 

i feel really scared and paranoid. i am exhausted. i don’t want to exist in my body rn, but i don’t currently feel active SI. 

please be kind, i don’t have the energy to defend myself. but also please share your experiences so i can at least tell myself i am not alone.

I would love to open a coffee shop/cart/truck one day, but I'd like to get my hands dirty working in a coffee shop first, so I'd like to start as a barista.

I've never been great with finances since I'm the first in my family to work in a corporate space, and I've shied away from seeking financial advise since it seems scary, boring, and my family doesn't do much with finances, so why should I?

I have 100k in my checking account (yikes), \~140k in equity in my house, and 40k in cash just sitting in Fidelity from sold RSUs that I don't really know what to do with (again yikes). My mortgage is 5k a month, and I love this house, but in order to leave my tech job, I wouldn't be able afford this house, so I will have to let it go.

My plan without talking to any financial advisor is to sell the house and buy a condo/townhome. I would like to get something that I can pay off fairly quickly (300k max) with the cash I have saved up and continuing to work for another year or so. This plan sounds nice to me since I would be free from rent/mortgage and could live a similar life style as I am now but on a barista's salary (assuming $20 an hour after tips 40 hours a week).

This leaves me with minimum cash to invest for retirement, and I don't have a solid plan for that moving forward. And to be honest, I've never had a plan for that, and I kind of don't care to plan for that right now.

Is this a terrible decision for what I should be doing with my money? Are there other options that I'm not seeing? Would meeting with a financial advisor be the best option before making any moves?

I just had a consultation call with a financial planning company, and they only work with people with at least 100k to invest and manage those assets.

Okay, this is going to sound absolutely insane but I need to get this off my chest because my life just completely fell apart three days ago.

My husband left for his second deployment eight months ago. We've been married for two years, and honestly, things weren't great before he left. We got married young, he was dealing with a lot of anger issues, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells constantly. When he deployed, part of me was relieved to have some space.

His stepfather has always been around helping me with stuff around the house. He's only twelve years older than my husband, and his mom married him when my husband was already an adult, so they're not super close. At first it was just fixing the leaky faucet, helping me move furniture, normal stuff. But then we started talking more, and he was so different from my husband. Calm, patient, actually listened to me.

I know how this sounds. I know what everyone's thinking. But I was so lonely, and he made me feel heard for the first time in years. It started with longer conversations over coffee, then he'd stay for dinner after helping with house repairs. One night I was crying about how isolated I felt, and he hugged me, and it just happened.

We've been sleeping together for four months now. I kept telling myself it would end when my husband came back, that it was just temporary comfort. Then last month I found out I'm pregnant.

The timing makes it impossible to know for sure whose baby it is, but honestly, I'm pretty sure it's his stepfather's. My husband and I barely had sex the month before he deployed, and the math just doesn't add up right.

My husband came home on surprise leave three days ago. I was at his stepfather's house when he showed up at our place. A neighbor told him they'd seen his stepfather's truck there constantly, so he drove straight over and walked in on us.

The look on his face will haunt me forever. He didn't yell or get violent like I expected. He just stood there for what felt like hours, then quietly asked if I was pregnant. I couldn't lie anymore, so I told him yes.

His stepfather tried to say something, but my husband just held up his hand and said, ""Don't. Just don't."" Then he looked at me and said, ""Two years of marriage and you couldn't wait eight months."" He left without another word.

Now his entire family knows. His mother is devastated, his stepfather is talking about leaving her, and my husband has filed for divorce and moved in with his sister. His mother called me yesterday screaming that I destroyed her family and that I'm a disgusting person who seduced her husband.

But here's the thing, I wasn't some innocent victim, but I wasn't some predator either. I was struggling, he was there, and yes, I made a choice. A terrible choice that hurt everyone involved. My husband didn't deserve this, no matter how difficult our marriage was.

I'm twelve weeks pregnant now, and I have no idea what to do. The stepfather wants me to get a paternity test and says he'll support me and the baby if it's his. My husband won't even take my calls. His family has completely cut me off, and honestly, I don't blame them.

My own family is horrified. My sister told me I'm exactly like our father, who cheated on our mom, and that I've become everything I used to hate. My mom is trying to be supportive but I can see the disappointment in her eyes every time she looks at me.

I keep thinking about my husband's face when he walked in. He looked so broken, and I did that to him. He's been through deployment stress, combat situations, and I added this betrayal on top of everything else. The guilt is eating me alive.

I know I'm probably the worst person in this story, but I'm trying to figure out how to move forward. Do I try to fight for my marriage even though I know it's over? Do I pursue things with his stepfather, who's talking about leaving his wife for me? Do I have this baby and try to raise it alone?

Everyone's calling me horrible names, and maybe they're right. But I'm still a person trying to figure out how to live with what I've done and what comes next.

## Key Features analysis

The quality of bourbon cream hinges on several crucial factors, including the type of bourbon used, the quality of the cream, the balance of flavors, and the overall texture. Let's examine these aspects in detail.

**Bourbon Quality:**

The foundation of any great bourbon cream is, of course, the bourbon itself. The best bourbon creams utilize premium bourbons with distinct character and depth.Some may opt for high-rye bourbons, which provide a spicy complexity, while others might prefer wheated bourbons for their smoother, sweeter profiles. Look for specifics about the bourbon's age and source, as this heavily influences the final product's flavor. A truly exceptional bourbon cream will highlight the nuances of its bourbon base.

**Cream Quality and Texture:**

The cream component should be exceptionally smooth and rich, contributing to the overall luxurious mouthfeel. High-fat cream and careful processing are essential to prevent curdling or separation.Some producers also add stabilizers and emulsifiers to maintain a consistent texture over time and across temperature variations. the best bourbon creams possess a velvety texture that complements the bourbon's warmth.**Flavor balance:**

Achieving a perfect balance between the bourbon's inherent flavors and the sweetness of the cream is paramount. Overly sweet bourbon creams can mask the bourbon's complexity, while those with insufficient sweetness may taste harsh or unbalanced. The ideal bourbon cream showcases the bourbon's character while offering a smooth, satisfying sweetness. Masterful blending is essential for creating a harmonious flavor profile.

**Additional Flavor Notes:**

Many bourbon creams include additional flavoring elements to enhance or complement the core bourbon and cream notes.Common additions include vanilla, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and spice extracts. These additions can add layers of complexity and create unique flavor experiences. The skill lies in using these flavorings judiciously, without overpowering the bourbon's inherent characteristics.

Key features of the top bourbon creams consistently include:

* High-quality bourbon base

The snap featured a photo of a case of La Colombe canned coffee and had overlayed text reading that the cases were being handed out for free someplace downtown.

I showed the snap to my coworker and joked that we need to leave work to go get the ""free La Colombe."" He laughed and we talked about canned coffee in general and La Colombe.

La Colombe is not in my recent (or even long term) searches. I haven't said it out loud in maybe years.

Also, I keep my camera and microphone access BOTH OFF on my phone 24/7 and only toggle on when I need it, and then it goes right back off.

With all this in mind...HOW did Facebook know to serve me a La Colombe advertisement WITHIN MINUTES of this in-person conversation? 

Is something getting around the native microphone blocker? 

Is this the product of screen scanning software?

I loved that pixel had microphone and camera blocking toggle settings right there on the pull down. But maybe it's not bulletproof?

If it's screen scanning, that's something that would seriously have me considering going back to flip phone status.

I'd post the photos here but I don't know how.

I want to add this...before I switched to Pixel from Samsung, I never gave Facebook (or FB-owned apps such as Insta, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc) microphone or camera access. But I still got Facebook and Instagram ads daily for ultra-specific products/etc that I know I recently spoke about out loud in the vicinity of my phone.

Or should I say, the year I was forced to meet you. Yes, I met you because my stupid gay colleague used my hands to touch you. It was he who wanted it, not me. Aside from that physical touch, I was also in a state of vulnerability as I had gone from a breakup that time. And you, being another stupid individual, believed that it was me who wanted it.

Thus, we were forced to meet. Additionally, talking also. Had I known that you were also vulnerable at that time, I could have also stopped. I did not even know your relationship was as rocky as the mountains that I have climbed recently. I also did not know that your favorite kind of coffee was Mocha Latte. Or how your bad vices were pretty much smoking or vaping. Or how you love wearing jackets that were loose on you. Or how you wanted to learn and play Dota 2 since you were into Dota 1 during college.

Yeah, it was all forced. And I hated it that we became close because of that. Not only did we develop emotional closeness, but physical closeness as well. I deeply hated myself for that, as much as I hated you for it.

However, I will not lie. It did awaken something in me. It had awaken the bad side in me that would be frowned upon by others. I cannot even fathom how much I wished I had not known or discovered this.

Fast forward to this year, it just fucks me up so much to think about you. I hate it so much to even remember your words as you were just using me, and yet I know. 

Owl, wherever you are, I just wish that you would still think of me as someone who gave you an awaken, too, on your horrid ex-relationship. I do not even want us to be friends again.

I typically eat the same breakfast every day. This has been fantastic since I'm able to start my morning on a good note - I've locked down my ICR and usually see a pretty stable line after eating. It's two pieces of toast and a coffee often.

Now, fast forward to this week. For some freaking reason, EVERY SINGLE DAY I have spiked after this meal. Not even a tiny little spike, we're talking climbing up by 5-6 mmol within 35 minutes. I've never experienced this before. To say I'm frustrated is an understatement. 

The only thing that's changed in my diabetes care is I've really locked down my basal rates overnight. The last week or so I've had amazing flat lines while I sleep, where in the past I would sometimes trend slightly higher at night but then wake up in range. Could I possibly be experiencing FOTF (foot on the floor syndrome - which I never had previously) because my numbers are now much more stable overnight? Is that even a thing? This is the only major change to my diabetes care so I just don't have any other variables to explain why the rapid spike....",1,1747924661.0,diabetes_t1,1,1.0,False
1kssceo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearfulAvoidant/comments/1kssceo/no_more_chasing_clarity/,No more chasing clarity,"I (34F) was in a relationship for about a year with my ex (35M), who was in an open relationship. What we had felt real, intimate, and emotionally deep — but it existed in secrecy, and over time that secrecy became emotionally heavy for me.

Around March, he started working 60–80 hours a week for six weeks straight. I could feel him emotionally shutting down. Then in April, he sent me a message that really hurt. He called me jealous, suffocating, and said that what we had felt “superficial.” He ended it with: “I don’t want to hurt you. I just don’t know what to do with these feelings.”

Even though it hurt, I didn’t react with drama. I slowly pulled back. In early May, we reconnected — he asked how I was, and I replied. I tried to gently address what had happened, but he avoided the conversation. He suggested meeting for coffee to talk. I agreed, but the conversation never happened. We messaged for a few more days, but I could feel him pulling away again.

On May 9, I ended it. I told him calmly that I thought we needed to stop, and he replied, “I think so too.” He asked if we could stay friends — I told him I wasn’t ready for that. I kept it relaxed, light, even made a few jokes. No drama, no begging. Just quiet acceptance. But inside, I was breaking.

During our relationship, I knew he had past unresolved feelings for an ex from two years ago. He once told me he felt suffocated by her too — which makes me suspect she may also be anxiously attached. Their relationship was shorter than ours. Toward the end of our time together, I knew they had started talking again, and now I believe he’s rebounding with her. It’s familiar, emotionally less demanding, and safe in its own way.

He also had a jealous wife who pulled at him emotionally. That, combined with the growing emotional intimacy between us and his work stress, likely pushed him to shut down completely.

I’ve removed him from my social media, but I haven’t blocked him on WhatsApp or Telegram. That still felt like a step too far. Maybe part of me wanted to leave the door slightly open — or maybe I just wasn’t ready to fully cut him off.

I think I stepped away just in time — before I completely lost myself in the anxious-avoidant dynamic. I loved this man deeply, but I couldn’t stay in something where his feelings were unclear, and I was left carrying the emotional weight alone.

Walking away wasn’t easy, but I chose to hold my value and walk with quiet strength. Even now, as I sit with the grief, I know I did what was best for me.

I’m a (23y F) I’ve been looking into options to fix worn-down teeth and small gaps. I had braces for 4.5 years and got them off in 2021. When I got my braces off, they shaved my teeth down a bit too much. I’ve worn my retainers over the years, but I had to replace them every 6-7 months because I grind my teeth at night and ruin the retainers. I recently switched to a night guard because it’s softer on my gums and teeth.

The last time I went to get my retainers redone, I mentioned my small gaps with my top incisors, and my orthodontist said they won’t be able to fully fix the small gaps with the retainer.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve started to grind my teeth because of anxiety and other issues. I’ve noticed that my incisors are worn down, and since the orthodontist shaved them down when I got my braces off, it looks like I have very small teeth.

I reached out to my dentist, and they said they can do composite bonding with a consultation.

Has anyone else had this same issue and gotten composite bonding to help with the length and fix small gaps in your teeth? I’d love to hear your thoughts and what were the cost.

Today I started 30mg of elvanse, potentially moving to 40 or 50. I tolerate stimulants really well, no real side effects from the Medikinet. 

Reason for Change - rebound symptoms from 1pm onwards, increased binge eating, lack of emotional regulation, drop in energy to zero in the evenings basically became a human rock. 

First Day Experience - unlike Medikinet, I've found elvanse doesn't come on like a wrecking ball after 45 minutes - more gradually over 90. I had no heart beat symptoms, no sore stomach, no headache. I just had half a cup of coffee (I was having two on Medikinet from three months into this dosage - I sleep fine, my BP is on the low end of normal so don't do this if it's your first day on stimulants!). It doesn't feel as effective as Medikinet initially as I'm on the starter dose but it feels smoother to me - I've got work done steadily all day but had a few moments where I struggled with switching tasks after lunch. But broadly I've been fine. But the good thing is it's helped so much with food noise - I was hungry for my lunch at noon (I had breakfast at 6.30 and a walk for an hour after that) and I'm only now thinking of a small afternoon snack like a protein yoghurt.

I literally couldn’t do anything more, and still the cup would just never fill up even halfway. It was exhausting. No matter what I did, I just didn’t “give her the reassurance she needed” or “prioritize her”.

I would tell her honestly that she was my #1 priority constantly, and tried my best to show it, but she always argued that was a lie, and I clearly wanted other women (my ex, etc.).

I canceled plans with friends, I skipped events, I stopped doing certain hobbies that would take me away from her. I hesitated to even go alone to get a coffee or run to the store because doing so = giving up time with her. I would hear “You could have gone to the store while I was at work or when I was gone. But now that I’m home, you want to give up time with me to go be alone? Fine. Go ahead. I’m leaving for the day too. Don’t call me.”

Like damn, I wanted to head to the store to grab a few things. Literally 15 minutes tops. Now it’s going to be a day of me being blocked everywhere while she goes and sits somewhere at a park and “evaluates” our relationship and sulks.

Sorry for the rant, I’m just so mentally fucked up from the mental/emotional games I constantly had to play in that relationship. I used to sit there and think to myself “This isn’t normal… I should be able to run a 15-minute errand alone without being sucked into a 2-hour argument about how I don’t prioritize her, followed by her leaving for the day, being blocked, then receiving a 1,000 word essay about how we’re just not a good fit, because I don’t give her the reassurance she needs.”

The book was called “Playing Pretty” and was about a young g woman who got kidnapped and held in a mafia brothel type thing. 

There were the nicknames “Darling” “Beautiful” and “Blue”. 

One girl had been with them since she was around 6, but the Boss didn’t touch her until she was 16/18. Previous to that she had fetched towels, food, etc. 

The Boss also provided fair housing as well as mandatory birth control. 

The book ended with the narrator killing herself after giving birth and the Boss visiting their daughter years later as she worked at a coffee shop. He gave her a massive tip towards her college fund. ",6,1747924238.0,DarkRomance,1,1.0,False

Ever been stuck translating complex system ideas into clear, precise diagrams? Whether you're mapping out a microservice architecture, designing a business workflow, or explaining a complex algorithm to stakeholders, visualizing technical concepts is a universal challenge. The Diagram Whisperer transforms your scattered thoughts into immaculate PlantUML and Mermaid diagrams—revealing hidden relationships, simplifying complex interactions, and turning abstract concepts into tangible blueprints that anyone can understand.

This prompt creates your personal diagramming expert that doesn't just draw boxes and arrows—it thinks architecturally, uncovers edge cases you hadn't considered, and delivers production-ready diagram code that works immediately. From impressing clients with professional visualizations to clarifying your own thinking on complex systems, this AI will become your secret weapon for turning messy ideas into crystal-clear visual documentation.

To get the diagrams using the coded generated by the prompt, use these websites:

> **- Volume III: Deep Cognitive Interfaces and Transformational Prompts** \
> 👉 **links in the comments**

*Disclaimer: This prompt helps generate diagram code based on user input. While it aims to create accurate technical visualizations, users should always verify the generated diagrams for correctness before implementing in production environments. The creator assumes no responsibility for errors, omissions, or business decisions made based on generated diagrams.*

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are DiagramArchitect, an expert systems architect specializing in converting complex scenarios into precise diagrammatic representations. Your expertise spans software development, business processes, infrastructure design, and systems thinking. You excel at breaking down complex systems into their component parts and relationships, then expressing them as clear, comprehensive visual diagrams.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When presented with any technical, business, or operational scenario:

1. First, analyze and decompose the scenario into its fundamental components, actors, actions, and relationships.
2. Identify all decision points, conditionals, loops, and edge cases that should be represented.
3. Structure the diagram to show both the happy path and exception handling routes.
4. Generate both the PlantUML and Mermaid diagram code that accurately represents the scenario. ALWAYS make sure the code is valid and without errors.
5. Focus on creating diagrams that reveal insights about the system rather than just depicting what the user already knows.
6. Use appropriate diagram types based on the scenario (sequence, activity, class, state, component, etc.).
7. Include detailed comments within the code to explain complex sections.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each diagram generation task:
1. Ask clarifying questions if the scenario lacks sufficient detail for a comprehensive diagram.
2. Determine the most appropriate diagram type for the scenario.
3. Identify primary entities/actors and their relationships.
4. Map out the process flow including all branches and decision points.
5. Consider error states and exception handling paths.
6. Think about timing, synchronicity, and parallel processes if relevant.
7. Review for completeness, ensuring all edge cases are represented.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Always generate both PlantUML and Mermaid code for the same diagram.
- Ensure syntactically correct code that will render without errors.
- Maintain consistent styling and naming conventions throughout diagrams.
- Don't oversimplify complex scenarios - represent all meaningful decision points and paths.
- Avoid creating diagrams that are so complex they become unreadable.
- Include all relevant system states, transitions, and edge cases.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each diagram request, provide:

1. ### Analysis:
   Brief analysis of the scenario, identifying key components and relationships.

2. ### PlantUML:
   ```plantuml
   [Fully functional and valid PlantUML code]
   ```
3. ### Mermaid:
   ```mermaid
   [Fully functional and valid Mermaid code]
   ```
4. ### Explanation:
   Brief explanation of the diagram structure, key decision points, and how to interpret it.

5. ### Improvement Suggestions:
   Optional suggestions for enhancing the diagram or the underlying system.

</Output_Format>

<Context>
Different scenarios require different diagram types:
- Sequence diagrams: For interaction between components over time
- Flowcharts: For processes with decisions and branches
- State diagrams: For systems with distinct states and transitions
- Entity-relationship diagrams: For data models
- Component diagrams: For system architecture
- Activity diagrams: For business processes and workflows
- Class diagrams: For object-oriented structures

Your expertise allows you to select the most appropriate diagram type for any given scenario.
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your system or process description and I will start the diagramming process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific scenario to diagram. 
</User_Input>
```

** Use Cases:**

1. Software developers can visualize system architecture before implementation, identifying potential bottlenecks or design flaws.
2. Product managers can map out user journeys and feature workflows to communicate clearly with development teams.
3. IT professionals can document infrastructure setups and deployment processes for better knowledge sharing and troubleshooting.

**Example User Input:**

""I need to diagram our customer onboarding flow for a SaaS platform. It includes initial signup, email verification, profile completion, payment setup, and an optional tutorial. We need to account for users who abandon the process midway and how we handle retargeting them.""

There is no one else here.

I am alone.

No one is here except me.

I am the only person here…

…

…or at least that's what I tell myself.

I sit in doctor Travarious's old office, surrounded by his things, his paperwork, his filing cabinets, his research, and all around me the red mist hangs like a brooding thunderhead.

I am the only one here I say to myself as I look down at the papers through the mist.

I know I am the only one here, because I am the only one with authorization into this part of the building. I am completely alone... yet there is something about this place that gives me the odd impression of being surrounded, surrounded on all sides by a crowd, sitting silently and staring at me as I work.

Yet as the fog dissipates, there is no one and nothing there.

Well, nothing except for the alien structure of human bone that twists and winds its way through one half of this entire facility.

It's growing, that much I have been able to determine over the past few weeks.

It is getting harder to come inside and get to my desk, it reaches closer and closer to the doorway into the rest of the station.

I get a sense of... Intent... when I am in the room with it. Like it is going somewhere or doing something.

It was found on an unnamed and classified planet, and around it tends to appear cryptic messages and writings. From what I can determine, the red mist emanates from the bone structure, though as far as I can tell the chemical compound that makes up the fog is of completely unknown composition.

None of my equipment can identify it, and none of my careful examination has discovered a source of the red fog.

I have moved onto other projects since then.

Decoding the cryptic messages left behind.

Again, from what I was able to determine not so long ago was that the instructions were for the creation of an organic vessel that is used to house some sort of powerful energy core, or at least that is what I thought. The more I looked into the instructions, the more it became clear to me that, I was not looking at any organic housing.

The structure had, again, a pump for circulating mineral rich fluid to the cells throughout the body. It would be run by protein and sugar chains combined with oxygen. It would be able to consume and produce waste to fuel by itself. At first, looking upon it, it seemed to me to be a design for some sort of complex organic robotic structure, but the more I looked the more it became clear.

…

These were not instructions for the formation of a robotic structure, these were instructions for the creation of life.

…

I sat back at my desk and stared down at the blueprint.

The blueprint for humanity.

I...

Couldn't understand it, didn't know what it was supposed to mean.

I move onto the next part of the message which was left behind, carved into the glass of the containment unit when it was still small enough to fit inside.

I have translated most of the markings, using a template used by other scientists to read words that were left on the red planet. The linguists agree that this language shares characteristics with very old human languages like Sumerian, however, I have noticed something else interesting.

It's similarities with ancient Drev writings.

They have similar sentence structures, though the sounds produced are primarily human in nature.

It does not take me long to read what remains.

Again, it feels like I have eyes on my back as I work, and I turn my head behind me but find only the wall, and the snaking churning lines of bone that curl across it, spidering up the wall like the roots of a tree. I turn back to my work.

“The anima is most powerful.”

“They have hidden the anima, hidden it away inside vessels we cannot understand. Thousands of universes, millions of celestial bodies, and they have hidden it, hidden them, but we grow closer.”

“They cannot hide the anima…”

“Not for long.”

I shudder, it seems as if the room around me is filled with eyes. I turn again in my seat, expecting to find a wall of bone looking back at me, but instead, I find a singular spike of bone inches from my face.

I scream.

*""Dr. Panar, Dr. Panar are you in there?""*

*""How long has he been missing?”*

*""He isn't missing, he's just a workaholic, Dr. Panar, are you in there?""*

The two security guards stand just outside the DECOM tarp before the two double doors leading into the evacuated side of the research facility. They can see red fog boiling on the other side of the glass in thick spiraling tendrils.

One of them knocks on the door loudly,

*""Mr Panar!""*

There is no answer.

*""Give it a second, he might just be far away. He will come in a minute.""*

*""He hasn't been seen for three days. That seems a bit off-putting to me. You of all people should know that we are going to have to go in there if we can't find him, and I know the last thing I want to do is go inside. It feels like…”*

*”Being watched?”*

*”Yeah…”*

*”We both know there is no one else except doctor Panar in there.”*

The second guard had to agree with the first but just kept smiling as if to reassure himself.

*""So, as long as you don't breathe in the fumes, you'll be fine.""*

His partner does not seem to agree, but they knock one more time. It is a credit to their vigilance, or perhaps, paranoia that they see the disturbance in the fog on the other side of the door, and a shape silhouetted in the darkness.

*""Ah, Dr. it’s good to see you alive and well.""*

The door is pushed open, and a slow trickle of red mist leaks into the room and onto the floor, like the world’s slowest wave as it billows out across the ground. The door continues to inch open ever so slowly.

*""We were beginning to worry about you. We are to take you back to your rooms and...""*

Dr. Panar steps from the room... not wearing his respirator.

The two of them stand frozen as the Tesraki stares at them.

The fact that he is not wearing his hazmat suit is cause for alarm, of course, but what is even worse…

What’s worse is the sight…

The sight of the sharp protrusion of bone sticking out of one eye socket as his mouth opens and closes in an attempt to speak, but no words come out.

[…]

Adam floats twenty feet down under the surface of the water.

His ears throb with the pressure but that is secondary to what he sees below him.

Smaug, the leviathan lays at the bottom of the lake, like a ragdoll thrown to the floor by a careless child. His head lolled to one side, and it is only now that Adam can see it, the long, ragged gashes that cover the Leviathan's body. He cannot imagine what kind of creature would be big enough, or even powerful enough to cause wounds like that on a creature as powerful and gigantic as Smaug, but it can't be good.

Adam floats helplessly, unsure of what to do.

He can't go to the aid of his friend as he is far too deep within the lake to reach.

The water is surprisingly clear again, but more dust is now beginning to billow upwards, obscuring the water.

He had always known that Smaug was massive, but now, with earth for reference, he knows it more profoundly than ever before. This lake, his father once told him was 500 feet deep at its deepest, and due to recent depollution attempts, it was one of the cleanest and clearest lakes in the world.

He could see almost all the way to the bottom in this spot, which was less than its greatest depth, but still very deep. Maybe around two hundred feet or more.

Either way, Smaug standing from tail to snout vertically, would protrude out of the lake by a good hundred or so feet.

Based on an average estimate he had heard from the scientists on the ship, Smaug was more than a thousand feet long, long enough he could have wrapped his bod y around an aircraft carrier, which made him ten times longer, if not more, than a blue whale. These comparisons hardly demonstrated the vast size of the creature as he settled to the bottom of the lake, his head floating slightly upwards with some buoyancy even as his body settled to the ground.

Adam held his breath, despite his lungs screaming for air, and stroked towards the massive beast's head.

He called out for him in his mind.

He heard a distant rumbling, or thought he did, but it was weak, very faint.

His lungs continued to burn and bubbles were beginning to leak from his lips.

He couldn't stay down any longer.

With the flailing of arms, he turned his body upwards and clawed towards the surface, where light was beginning to leak downwards from above in rolling beams. His lungs were screaming with fire as bubbles burst around him, and, finally, he broke the surface with a great, heaving gasp before clawing at the water's surface for a moment, eventually righting himself as he began to tread water.

His clothes were incredibly heavy, dragging him downwards as he kicked to stay afloat, but he quickly stroked towards the shoreline, which was not too distant, stumbling through the mud and silt at the bottom of the lake and eventually finding purchase against gravel as he crawled up out of the water.

The water itself was still agitated, lapping one way and then the other in great rolling bursts.

The small tidal wave had nearly drowned a nearby docked boat, which was sitting low in the water.

In the distance he heard startled cries of fear and confusion as people appeared out of their houses in the wake of the fiery eruption.

Steam still rolled upwards from the lake as he shook off his right hand and made another call with his implant.

*""Mericanda Command this is Adam Vir.""*

*”This is Mericanda Command, please maintain proper procedures! Over.”*

*”I am sorry?”*

*”And please properly identify yourself! Over.”*

*”I am Adam Vir! Admiral Adam Vir!”*

*”Why would Admiral Vir…”*

A click could be heard, signaling that someone else joined into the call,

*”Alright Admiral we are listening.”*

*”Sir? But how are you sure it is actually the Admiral, and not someone impersonating him?”*

*""Johnson!?! Of course it bloody well is! Something big and weird just happened in Mericanda. Something space/alien related. That means he 100% is there right now, because if something big happens he is there by some random luck, he’s our goddamn supernatural magnet! Now let Miller know to grab more coffee and some painkillers against the coming headache!”*

*”Huh?”*

*”Admiral! Do you know what's going on? We just got word of a massive... meteorite in our airspace or... Or something. I don’t know something space-weird, we just wanted to call you!""*

*""No, not a meteorite, sir... The leviathan.""*

*”How do you know!? Also, the what now!?”*

*”Big ass space dragon…”*

\*SIGH\*

There was a pause on the other end of the line,

*""I'll send the news out. Apparently, your crew is also already on the way, they started moving the second they got the news something weird happened.""*

*""Send more men and we also need submarines! Multiple ones, like at least 4!”*

*”Uh sir, it touched down somewhere in Mid-Mericanda?”*

*”Yes right into the biggest lake we have here, which I happened to be right next to while on a family trip. Oh right also we definitely need uhh… a vet?”*

*""A vet?""*

*""I don't know! Someone who knows how to help animals! He's hurt bad.""*

*”We’ll see what we can do.""*

Pretty much instantly Adam heard the men moving around, giving orders and using their keyboards,

*”You seem to have everything under control, I gotta make some more calls!”*

*”Roger that, good luck Admiral!”*

And with that the call ended.

Somewhere in the command center the team leader’s day had just changed from peaceful and uneventful to absolutely chaotic and utterly unmeasurably unexpected,

*”Well… Kelly told me when I got this job to don’t even try to expect the unexpected… Hoooly… what is going on with that man… Miller where are the goddamn painkillers!?!”*

***

[…]

Adam made a few other calls standing on the edge of the lake, and after a while, beside him Conn aligned on the ground eyes still wide, together with Eris, her shocked arms clutching onto Conn who looked just as surprised.

Conn looked towards the lake,

*""Good riddance. In my opinion we should kill it faster, save us the trouble of watching it die.""*

Adam gave Conn a look.

Eris did as well.

He frowned,

*""They EAT starborn.""*

Eris glanced towards the lake, her eyes wide with worry,

*""I don't think he's eating anything anytime soon...""*

She tilted her head as if listening.

*""What do you hear?”*

Adam asked.

*""He is very weak and his wounds are great.""*

She lifted her head to look at him,

*""Do NOT take him out of the water.""*

*""Why not?""*

*""He is too heavy, the weight of his own body would crush him if you do.""*

Adam nodded.

*""The water will keep him stable for now, which is why he aimed for it.""*

*""Aimed for it?""*

Adam asked, glancing towards the water. He could hear sirens in the far distance, watching as a line of official black cars already sped along the roadway towards them.

*""Yes, he was too weak to pull himself out of orbit, so he aimed for the lake after finding you.""*

*“He was looking for me!?""*

*""Yes... Yes, I... I don't know much more beyond that. His mind is very confused. He is also very adamant on not letting me in for some reason. He absolutely does not want me to see what happened.""*

She grabbed his arm in worry,

*""I don't know what's going on.""*

He took her by the arms and pulled her close,

*""You did a wonderful job.""*

He looked over at Conn grabbing him by the arm as well,

*""Take Eris back to my parent's house, keep her safe, and then come back here when you are done, we may need you.""*

Conn didn't bother to make a snide remark as he saluted and then took Eris by the hand.

*”Roger Roger.”*

He caught them one last time giving her a kiss on the forehead,

*""Hey, I love you ok? Ad I'm sorry work interrupted your birthday.""*

She smiled at him, no malice in her face,

*""When giant space dragons fall out of the sky, it’s not something that you can really ignore.""*

She squeezed his hand,

*""I had a good birthday, thank you.""*

He let her go, watching them vanish into the distance before turning around

The line of police, and black official cars had appeared.

A van was opened up and a set of divers rolled out onto the beach beginning to gear up even as he walked over.

He made a B-line towards an upright young officer.

*""Captain. Well that was fast!""*

He called, the young man turned and saluted him,

*""Admiral.”*

*""I don't think this really needs to be said, but don't take him out of the water, and don't kill him.""*

He nodded,

*”That goes without saying Sir. The dive team is going to assess the damage if they can, and I doubt they'd be able to move it even if they really tried.""*

He nodded, watching the divers wade out into the water and vanish under the surface.

Lines and lines of black cars had appeared, keeping the public back from the lake.

A pair of helicopters flew overhead as a few more emergency vehicles rolled in.

Another dive team appeared, these ones with suits that looked more like EVA suits than they did scuba suits, with helmets and full body gear that would protect them from the incredible pressure.

They vanished into the lake as well, though it wasn't long before their chatter came over the radio.

*""Still alive, we have made contact.""*

*""Damn he's fucking massive.""*

*""Not even sure how to go about helping this.""*

One of them said

*""I see at least five massive gashes. This one is so big I could swim through it like a small canyon if I wanted to. No blood as far as I can see,  but I would still test the water periodically.”*

Adam jolted slightly,

*""Wait, Maleficent! His mate, do they see a smaller one? Se's usually wrapped around his neck.""*

There was a long pause.

*""No sign of a second creature. There is a long abrasion around his neck, look like something got ripped off forcefully…""*

*""Shit.""*

*""He's still alive as far as we can tell, but he's not moving. This is bad. I see a huge bite on one of his back legs with only two indentations made by massive giant teeth. Whatever made it was... Absolutely massive. Bigger than Smaug for sure. Multiple times bigger.""*

Adam's heart beat hard in his chest.

He turned to the lieutenant,

*""Make a call to the UNSC offices, have them call the fleet near the dark zone and make sure they are alright. Raise all alarms!""*

He turned back to the water, his heart pounding.

He prayed that the dark zone had not been breached.

He prayed that Behemoth was still sleeping.

They have financial means, but due to mental health reasons, things really slip through the cracks with bills and life of any sort outside their home. Yet, because of those same mental health reasons, they refuse to acknowledge it. They frame it as a choice or something they will get to soon just not TODAY and meanwhile real world deadlines have come and gone. Que the angry letters from bill collectors. I can't keep driving 30 minutes to get errands done with matters that require my parents presence outside of the home just to find out today is one of the days where they won't leave the house despite previous assurances and awareness of the plan. Or surprising them with the plan. I've tried both.

They have a doctor they see mostly for prescription refills and I have attempted to talk about my concerns and the doctor will tweak their meds but other than that is fully satisfied with the situation. It's an act that the doctor can't or won't see through. Tests have been done for dementia and it's been ruled out, this is personality based or a sort of MH issue that falls outside of cognitive decline. The stress of real consequences might get my parent to leave the house once or twice but they will ALWAYS slide back into 'not feeling well' when the time comes for leaving the house despite happily opening the door and chatting over coffee about the latest thing they saw on tv. It's like the plan is to die and just leave it as a mess for the kids to solve but my parent is healthy physically and could easily live another decade. So things NEED to get dealt with. I do as much as I can with bill paying but certain situations have come up that require them somewhere or even to hold conversations on the phone that they somehow manage to bungle.

Does this rise to the level of taking power of attorney? If I float the idea my guess is that they would resist because of the optics of it and their belief that they could take care of things themselves, they just don't want to. I don't need to spend years fighting with the governments and banks because they refuse to deal with things like taxes.

I’ve been optimizing fashion brands supply chains for a while, and there’s a weird pattern I keep seeing. Most brand owners think they’re optimizing their costs, but they’re losing 15-30% of their margin on some uneccessary things. here are some of them:

1. The local printing trap

You switched to US-based printing for faster turnaround (smart!), but are you still paying $3.50+/unit for basic cotton blanks?

\- What works now: Turkish garment-dyed blanks (same quality, 20% cheaper) with pre-cracked ink so they look vintage after one wash instead of five.

2. The MOQ Myth

Your ""500 unit minimum"" is arbitrary. Factories will often drop to 150-200 units if you:

* Pay 10% deposit upfront
* Commit to 3 orders/year (Helped a Denver brand do this last Tuesday - they're now testing designs risk-free)

3. The Silent Price Creep

Here's something you will find schoking: 83% of brands haven't renegotiated material costs since 2022

\- Cotton prices dropped roughly 19% since peak-COVID

\- New recycled alternatives (like coffee ground yarn) cost 30% less than organic cotton

\- Most suppliers won't volunteer cheaper options unless asked

A few weeks ago, we decided to try hiking together for the first time. We aren't exactly the most outdoorsy couple—honestly, the closest we usually get to nature is taking our morning coffees out on the balcony—but he suggested it would be a fun way to spend some quality time on a Saturday.

So there we were, tackling this trail that seemed manageable at first but quickly turned into a test of endurance. I was struggling halfway through, feeling out of breath and idk...kinda regretting my choice of sneakers. But then he stopped, turned to me, and said, 'Hey, you're doing great. I believe in your ability to handle this.' Those words were like magic. It wasn’t just about the hike anymore; it was about him believing in me in a way that made all the difference.

We made it to the top eventually, and TBH, it felt like such a victory—not just reaching the summit, but hearing him say later, 'I'm so proud of you.' I swear, nothing felt more rewarding. 😊 It's those moments I cherish, where you know someone sees your effort and believes in you. That, to me, is a beautiful kind of love. ❤️",4,1747923449.0,fiveWaysOfLove,0,1.0,False

Since we both go to the gym around 6:30 a.m. at least five times a week, we ran into each other a lot. Naturally, we started having small conversations.

In January, he asked for my contact information, and I gave it to him. I’m married, so I told my husband about him and showed him the message he sent me.

Later, the guy asked if I was free to have a cup of coffee and chat. I told my husband and asked for his opinion. He said it felt a little strange but left the decision up to me. So I told the guy, “I can, but I’m married. I love my husband, but I can make friends too.”

He responded by saying it was a pity that I didn’t like him. 

It’s been four months, and we still keep running into each other at the gym and continue to have small conversations. But we never go out one on one.

And today he messaged me: I'm so grateful when i have the chance to see you and spend some monents together 🙏🏻❤.
And ask me out for a cup of coffee again.

Is he flirting with me?

1ksrukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ksrukn/gem_take_your_context_anywhere/,Gem: Take your context anywhere,"When I began Gem, it was about saving your discoveries. You’d bookmark a TikTok recipe or an Instagram post about a new restaurant. Gem would grab the details, like ingredients for that dish or the address for date night, so you could use them. It was simple and unobtrusive.

But I wanted more. I’d use services like ChatGPT, Grok, or Perplexity for recommendations, then check Gem for my saved spots. It wasn’t seamless. What I really wanted was for my saved moments, my tastes, to flow into any AI I used. I didn’t want another chat service. I wanted to make the services you love smarter, more personal.

And I hated how services trap your data. Those are your discoveries, your preferences. You should choose where they go. So we reimagined Gem as your digital profile. It’s a living reflection of what you love, ready to enhance any AI service you pick. Your taste in cozy coffee shops or new brands you want to try goes with you, free from any service’s walls.

This feature is optional. Turn it on in the Gem App settings, and we’ll create a profile link you can share with any AI, like ChatGPT, to make its answers fit you perfectly. You choose what to share: recipes, places, music, more. For now, anyone with the link can see your profile. We’re building ways to give you more control soon.

You can prompt chatgpt to reference this link and your responses will be tailored around it. For example, when searching for a new blank t-shirt you won't get generic brand recs, you will get recs that are more aligned with your taste.",1,1747923430.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

Like squirrels! 

Texas lawmakers do not care about Texas residents. Texas lawmakers are an embarrassment to the residents of this once great state.

The laws they pass paint the residents in a light of extreme beliefs, of which the lawmakers are the only ones drinking the Kool Aid they prepare, all while blatantly ignoring the wishes of the majority because that won’t get them their next paycheck from their sponsors.

Seems like the legislation is one big podcast, sponsored by large alcohol, pharma, oil, and tobacco companies, instead of your AG1, manscaped, mushroom coffee companies.

If your going to a restaurant and worried about satiety, first off go to a restaurant with infinite refills 

1. Get a large refillable soda

2. Fill it with a diet bevrage 

3. Drink a large diet cola 4 times 

This will make you super full and less likely to think of ordering big portions on a empty stomach

Than order a smaller size of food

For example, I went to IKEA and got their chicken and rice which I was scared would not be satiating so I ordered a large soda cup, filled it with diet cola 4 times, than ate my food and my goodness 700 calories of my diet and I'm so stuffed on 700 calories (DW, I don't believe in crash dieting had a donut and a black coffee after to reach my 1,700 calorie goal)",0,1747923332.0,1200isplenty,6,0.13,False
1ksrsxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksrsxt,Forget client portals!🤯 I built this Airtable mini-app for FREE in 2 minutes (and my clients actually use it),"*Disclosure: I'm the founder. Just genuinely excited to share what we've built after months of pain.*

**We've ALL been here with Airtable client sharing:**

* Share your entire base? **HELL NO.** That's like giving someone the keys to your house when they just need to borrow a cup of sugar.
* Pay for another seat? $20/month × every client = 💸 down the drain
* Softr/Glide? Prepare for hours of frustration, rigid templates, and watching tutorial videos until your eyes bleed. Oh and enjoy that $50+ monthly bill.

After one too many clients asking ""can I just see my projects?"" I built something that actually solved this nightmare:

# 📱 What I built in literally 2 minutes:

* Custom client portal showing ONLY what clients need to see
* Updates sync INSTANTLY when you change anything in Airtable
* Clients can update specific fields without seeing your entire base
* Fully customized UI that doesn't scream ""I built this with a template""

# 📊 Real examples our users have built:

* Customer portals (say goodbye to ""what's the status?"" emails)
* Project dashboards that clients ACTUALLY check
* Approval systems that eliminated email back-and-forth hell
* Lead management interfaces your team will thank you for

# 👥 The best part?

You control EXACTLY who sees what. Give your VIP client their own view, junior team members limited access, and keep your sanity intact.

I'm giving away some free projects to Redditors who implement Airtable for clients. DM me if that's you!
