Prudence was five minutes late to her doctor’s appointment. It was Saturday morning, and she hadn’t wanted to go to the doctor anyway – and she didn’t want to leave her house. She wasn’t a fan of doctors, and didn’t like appointments. But, her prescription for her thyroid medication would not be filled, the nurse had told her, unless she came in for a yearly physical (it had been two years, but they were not going to be lenient any longer). Prudence knew she needed it; her brain fog was coming back, and she was getting forgetful. She felt sluggish, and her clothes weren’t really fitting. Thyroid, menopause – whatever it was. It sucked. But, so is life, she thought, as she walked to her car. Her moment of reflection was jarred by the incessant barking of the neighbor’s dog, Kip. Kip liked to yip, they said home. Kip barked constantly, and was always outside. She knew her neighbors were at home, but she imagined they had soundproof glass – so Kip stayed outside for the world to hear, while they got respite in their home.

Also, Prudence had been up late last night at “book club.” Air quotes intentional – they did talk about books, for about 15 minutes. Usually, right before they dispersed for the night. Most of the evening was spent lamenting the day to day of a bunch of middle aged ladies. While there were always laughs, and always some good gossip, these evenings didn’t make Prudence as recharged as they used to. Instead, she began to fret about what they would do to her sleep cycle, and how she’d tackle her ever growing to-do list the next morning. 

Prudence made her way to the clinic, and checked in with Tera, the receptionist. She noticed Tera looked different – thinner maybe? Tan? She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but she quickly made her way to an exam room – the benefits of being a bit late. The nurse began her usual line of questioning, took her blood pressure, and then checked her current prescriptions. 

“This will just be a prick,” she said, looking up, smiling, as she took a quick blood sample from Prudence’s finger. 

Next was the doctor. Dr. Lucky was the best doctor in town, of which there were many. He was a good listener, patient, and just a good guy. 

When Prudence’s middle son, Tony, was struggling two years ago with anxiety, he developed a nervous tic; it became a verbal one, and Prudence would watch in horror as he appeared to talk in tongues at times. His actions became reckless, and he’d try to touch the hot stove or run into the street. Prudence brought him to Dr. Lucky in tears, and he calmly reassured both of them. He offered a variety of treatments – therapy, medicine, wait and see. In the end, Tony, began taking some medication and within three days, all the issues were gone. It was like a miracle.

One of her friend’s son’s had been diagnosed with an advanced case of MS. It was a shock, and it was tragic really. Dr. Lucky researched a salve he could use, and after using it for a few months, Shane made a really drastic recovery. No one could explain it, but no one cared. He was saved. 

“I hope you’re not going to ask for ozempic,” he said as he listened to her breathing. 

“Of course not,” Prudence laughed.

“Or an antidepressant. Asking for adderall? That’s the new one. That or hormone therapy. Hormone therapy isn’t really even a thing – that and vitamin cycling”

“Nope – I am perfectly content with being slightly overweight and slightly depressed. I think that is what is normal.”

“You’re just too reasonable, Prudence. I should’ve known better,” he said smiling. 

They talked about her children, his children, busy schedules, too. Everyone was doing fine. Everything was fine. Work was work, and home was busy. The middle age mantra.

“You’re all set. I’ll see you back in a year – for real this time. Don’t make my nurse keep hounding you, okay?”

“I know, I know. I just get busy, and I just don’t really feel like coming each year. I have an apple a day, I am fine with aches and pains. There are so many things – with work, with the kids. Around the house. Things suck – but that’s life. It’s not a highlight reel, you know? But, I will try. I will make the appointment before I leave so I can held to it. I don’t cancel things that are on my calendar.”

“If you do really want to avoid things like this, I do have another option. It is something new. My pharm rep just brought it last week. She says it is completely harmless, has remarkable results, and should be completely approved and vetted within the next 6 months,” he said, not looking away from his computer as he completed Prudence’s chart.

Prudence paused. Where was this coming from, she thought. They had just been discussing the normal aspect of growing older and growing less enthusiastic. Embracing the suck. She had been declared reasonable, for Christsake. 

“No thank you,” she said. “I’m good. Well, fine. You know.”

“Well, if you change your mind, call the nurse. Since I just saw you, it would be easy to set it up. Only thing is, since it’s not totally approved, you wouldn’t pick it up at the pharmacy. I have it here. So, you know, you’d have to come in, but I’d just leave at the desk with Tera,” he said, finally looking at her and smiling. 

“Just stay reasonable. No one likes someone who doesn’t do as they’re told,” he said, as he walked out.

What an odd statement, Prudence thought. He had never spoken to her that way. Maybe she hadn’t noticed it before, but Prudence thought Dr. Lucky’s eyes seemed different, as he said this. She had never paid attention to his eyes before, so maybe they were always that unusual shade of gray, almost silver. Maybe it was the lights. Prudence shook the thought from her mind.

They exchanged their goodbyes, and Prudence left the room, setting her appointment for the next year as she passed by the receptionist’s desk. 

“So, are you going to take it?” Tera asked as she handed her the prescription card. 

“Take what?”

“Oh, didn’t he mention it? The new meds we got. I started this week, and let me  tell you. Everything doesn’t suck anymore! Isn’t that amazing? Like, I feel better, lost ten pounds. I don’t yell at my husband, I don’t mind making lunches or doing laundry. Everything is just easy. And, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel good.” Tera looked up expectantly. 

“Yeah, medicine isn’t really my thing. And, you know I don’t like doctor visits. I’m good.”



\*\*\*

Prudence quickly walked out to her car. She ran a few errands. There were groceries to pick up, a quick trip to the post office. She got a text indicating her prescription was ready, so she headed to the pharmacy. As she waited in line, she thought about the conversations she had had. It was just so strange.  

When it was her turn, the pharmacist let her know her prescription was out of stock.

“This has been happening a lot, unfortunately. Good news though; we checked with Dr. Lucky, and he has a substitute you can use until we get more inventory. It’s the exact same as the thyroid medicine you were taking before, but it just looks a bit different and has a different name. He did say take two today – right away, though, because you haven’t been taking it for a while. We put you on autofill, too. I know things get crazy,” she smiled. 

“Well, thank you for taking care of all that. And, will do,” Prudence replied, sticking the bottle in her purse. 

“Hey, they did that to me, too,” an older man standing behind her said. “And, I love it. Best change. My arthritis is gone!” he said smiling.

“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Prudence said. “But, I don’t have arthritis.”

“Don’t matter. It just makes everything better.”

She got to her car, and took two of the small, gray pills, as she had been instructed. Though she had never taken two pills before, aside when she probably overdosed herself if she forgot she took it, she did as she was told. She trusted Dr. Lucky, even if he and Tera were a bit off today. Plus, she had to do something about this crabbiness and shortness she was feeling. Prudence didn’t like feeling this way, but she knew it was normal. Washing it down with some water, she made two more quick stops, and headed home, mentally planning out the rest of the day, which included chores, practice, food prep, and catching up on some work. 

As Prudence pulled into her driveway, she noticed something strange: Kip, usually a blur of energy, sat perfectly still in their yard, staring at her car. Its eyes seemed off—dull and glassy, like it wasn’t entirely there. Shrugging it off, she hurried into the house, the sense of unease lifting as she busied herself with unpacking groceries, starting laundry, and getting lunch fixed for the boys..

Her phone buzzed. It was a text from an unknown number:**“Change your mind yet?”**

Prudence frowned and blocked the number. It had to be some kind of sales spam.

Another text. This one from the book club girls:

**“My head is killing me. Haven’t left bed. Who’s going to do all my laundry today?”**

Not me, thought Prudence. Embrace the suck, she typed back, and got a few “haha’s” – they were all in the same boat.

\*\*\*

That night, as she lay in bed, she dreamed of Dr. Lucky. In the dream, he wasn’t in his office but standing at the foot of her bed, smiling kindly. ""Everything could be easier,"" he whispered, his voice calm but insistent. ""You wouldn’t even notice the change. No more aches, no more pains. Just... *better*.""

She woke with a start, heart pounding. The room was silent except for the faint sound of her phone buzzing. Bleary-eyed, she picked it up. Another text from a different number:**“It’s not too late.”**

Prudence deleted the message and tossed the phone onto her nightstand. This was getting weird. She decided to call the clinic in the morning and find out more about whatever was happening.

But by morning, something else had changed.

The neighbor’s dog’s incessant morning barking was gone. In fact, as she looked out her window, she saw Kip sitting directly next to their fence, staring intently at her. Silently. Maybe they got one of those shock collars or bark collars. A holiday miracle, she thought, as she walked into the kitchen. Her usual morning sluggishness was also gone. Prudence noticed it as soon as she stepped out of bed—her body felt lighter, her head clearer. It was unsettling. She didn’t feel like herself, though she couldn’t put her finger on why. And, it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Maybe it was that dose she took yesterday; maybe this new medication was just better. She took her gray pill, washing it down with some coffee.

Her phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with another unknown number:**“You’re welcome.”**

That’s when Prudence remembered Tera’s words. *“Everything doesn’t suck anymore.”*

She stopped in her place. A chill ran over her body. Had they done something to her? Was it a trick, or worse—an experiment? She tried to call the clinic, but the line was busy. She called again. No answer.

Hours passed, and Prudence couldn’t shake the feeling of calm, even though she was never calm on a Sunday. Sunday Scaries were real for her – she’d had them ever since she was a little girl. The strange lightness in her body turned into an eerie detachment, like she was floating through the day. Her kids noticed her distraction and were louder and more rambunctious than normal, but she let it pass. Her husband mentioned her blank stare. Prudence brushed them off. She was just relaxed, she told them. But, she couldn’t put her finger on it. She wasn’t panicked by all this. She was actually being way more productive than she normally was. The entire thing was just strange. 

When she finally drove back to the clinic to talk to Dr. Lucky on Monday morning, the building was dark, the doors locked. A sign on the door read:

**“Closed for reorganization. Thank you for your patience.”**

Her phone buzzed one last time:**“Don’t fight it, Prudence. It’s easier this way.”**

Prudence’s breath caught in her throat as she stared at the sign on the clinic door.

Her phone buzzed again in her hand. She didn’t want to look but couldn’t resist.

**“Make an Appointment. We’ll explain everything. xxx-xxx-xxxx.”**

She backed away from the clinic, clutching her phone tightly, the screen still glowing with the message. Her mind raced. How could they know she was here? Was she being watched? And, why her? She was just a regular person – a reasonable one, she reminded herself. Her body still felt lighter, more energized than usual, but that sensation left her feeling as though her own limbs were not entirely under her control. “As if driven by a motor,” she thought to herself. 

This evening, she couldn’t sleep. Her husband had no trouble, and while she was usually annoyed by his snoring and snorting, she found comfort in knowing she wasn’t alone. The sound of the wind outside resembled whispers. When she finally drifted off, the dreams returned—this time more vivid. Dr. Lucky was there again, his warm, confident smile now an unsettling mask. He stood next to her bed, holding a small vial of shimmering liquid.

“Why fight it, Prudence?” he said. His voice echoed in the dream, soft yet commanding. “You don’t have to struggle anymore. No one does. Be reasonable.”

She woke in a cold sweat, her throat dry, her heart hammering against her ribs. Stumbling to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake the lingering unease. When she looked up into the mirror, she froze.

Her reflection stared back at her, but something was wrong. Her eyes, usually warm and brown, were now faintly tinted with silver, the irises shimmering in the dim light. Her hands trembled as she reached up to touch her face, as if to confirm she was still herself.

\*\*\*

The next day, Prudence called the number she was instructed to on her phone. Tera answered, cheerful as usual. 

“Hey, girl! Did you change your mind?” Tera asked.

“No, not at all. Look, I need to make an appointment. And, I saw you guys moved. Why didn’t anyone mention that when I was there?”

“Oh, yes. I must have forgot. It’s been busy, you know. And, we’re busy. We’re about two weeks out. Everyone is trying to get this new medication. We’re actually having to work from an old office while we fix things up at the clinic. But, it’s right downtown. xxx Main. Will that work?”

Prudence paused. She wanted to talk to Dr. Lucky now. But, she wasn’t sick. And, maybe this eye things was just an old age thing. She’d look that up when she got home. 

“No, two weeks works. See you then.”

“Sounds good. I have you down. And remember, if you do change your mind, you don’t need an appointment. You can just call me, and I’ll open up for you.”

“No. Thank you.” Prudence ended the call. 

\*\*\*

**“How are we going to make it? Bonus book club? My house? Bring wine?”**

The next two weeks went quickly, and were filled with texts like this from Prudence’s group. Luckily, there were no more texts from the unknown numbers. Prudence had blocked each and everyone of them – someone got her number and was having some fun, she thought – the only reasonable explanation.  It was the last two weeks of school before winter break. Prudence’s days were full of work, then activities. Concerts for the boys, sports practices. Potluck prep for her husband. Not to mention gift buying, and wrapping. Along with holiday cards. These weeks were always the worst. There was so much to do, and one couldn’t even enjoy it.

But, this year was different. It was busy. It was so busy. But, Prudence just sailed through. People at work complimented on how fresh she looked. Her clothes were fitting better, but she associated this with just running all over the place and actually taking her meds. The staff at her school raved about the ham and beans she brought, and everyone even got seconds during their own luncheon. Her children didn’t complain about going non stop. Her husband complimented her and showed his appreciation through words and his actions. He even began doing laundry and making dinner a few nights during the week.

The only thing that was off – other than “things not sucking” as Tera had said, was the dreams. Prudence began to dream of Dr. Lucky every night. They didn’t feel like dreams. It felt like he was right there beside her bed. He wasn’t, obviously, because it would wake up her husband. But, it felt like he came to her each night, asking her questions, as he did in the office. Requesting she give this new medication a try. By the end of the two weeks, these talks had taken a turn. Dr. Lucky became angry, foreceful. One time, he had shaken her. 

“You’re just not being reasonable. Prudence, you need this. Your family needs you to take this. Look how much better this break was. Just take it.”

In another, he smiled and put his hands around her throat. 

“If you won’t be cooperative, then I am going to have to call someone else in. Just be reasonable, or else I won’t be able to help you.”

She awoke each time before she succumbed to the doctor, catching her breath. She reached over to her husband, who snorted and rolled over. They were always just a dream. 

One would think these nights of restless sleep would start to wear on a person. But, Prudence kept on keeping on, as she had started to say. They weren’t pleasant, but they weren’t hurting anyone. And, they weren’t holding her back. They were dreams. Dreams come and go. There is always a reasonable explanation for strange dreams. Just like her eyes, which continued to shimmer with a silver glow. She could explain this away, as well. It was the reflection from the new lights in the sconce her husband had installed. Same in her car – the silver was probably from the snow that blanketed the ground as the endured the first cold snap of the season. Everything was able to be explained. 

\*\*\*

Her appointment had finally arrived. As she approached the building, the sky looked – different. It was almost as if the sun and sky were washed out. Flat, almost. That happens sometimes when the sun is low, she thought. As she crossed the parking lot, she stopped. The building, this new one, seemed to be glowing or shimmering – metallic almost – though made of the same old brick as many other buildings in town. This stark contrast to the watercolor sky and surroundings was unsettling. It’s the position of the sun, she told herself. This time, the building was unlocked, though the waiting room was empty, its lights flickering faintly. A low hum filled the air, like machinery working behind the walls.

“Dr. Lucky?” she called out, her voice trembling.

A figure emerged from one of the exam rooms. It wasn’t Dr. Lucky. It was Tera, the receptionist, but her appearance was different. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes shone with the same silvery hue Prudence had noticed in herself.

“We’ve been expecting you,” Tera said, smiling too wide, her teeth unnervingly perfect. “You’re going to feel so much better, Prudence. You probably already do. We thought you needed a little push. You’re just so reasonable. But, you’ve only gotten the tiny dose. Today, you get it all. Then, you’re going to feel so much better. Just like the rest of us.”

Behind Tera, shadows moved, taking the shape of figures—patients, nurses, all with the same silvery eyes and too-perfect smiles. 

She saw the man from the pharmacy, smiling as he received an infusion of a silvery liquid, which shimmered and glowed in its bag, and appeared to illuminate through the man’s veins in his thin, thin arms. There was her neighbor, Suzanne, who was waiting, smiling, on an exam table, as a nurse Prudence had never seen prepped a syringe of the same silver liquid, and smiling, shut the door in Prudence’s face. It appeared each of the 10 exam rooms were full, and in each, someone Prudence knew was ready to be seen. 

Tera came closer, trying to take Prudence by the arm. Prudence started to back up, but was stopped by a tall man dressed in scrubs, who towered over her smiling. She turned to run to the exit, which was only feet away, her pulse roaring in her ears. She realized too late that the clinic door had closed behind her with a soft, deliberate click.

\*\*\*

When Prudence got home from Dr. Lucky’s, she began dinner and a load of laundry. There were moments when she felt as if she were just going through the motions, like there was some silent scream ready to leave her lips. But, she helped her kids with their homework, rubbed her husband’s feet, and read two chapters in her book club book. The laundry was done and loaded, and the boys and her husband complimented her on the dinner. There were no fights over the video games, and no eye rolls when she said it was time for bed. The feeling she had, the terror and the dread, were wrapped, tucked deep, as if enveloped in a heavy, wool blanket. 

As she lay in bed, she grabbed her phone, and texted her book club group chat.

**“Hey there, girlies! It’s been a while. Just checking in. I’ve been reflecting a lot lately—about how hectic life gets, especially now. But something's... shifted for me. It’s like this quiet clarity settled in. Everything feels lighter, easier, like a fog lifting. It’s strange to explain, but I feel** ***aligned*****, you know? Things just... fit now. No struggle, no noise. I can finally breathe without feeling the weight of it all. There’s this place—Dr. Lucky’s new space. It’s serene, almost surreal. No waiting, no fuss. Feels like stepping into something** ***right*****. Be reasonable. Treat yourself. You deserve it.”**

Henry Prince and his wife Rosie have just moved to Blue Tower, a city full of life and adventure. Rosie lived with her family in Havana until she met Henry. He and his family were on vacation, and it was love at first sight. Both Henry and Rosie are in their early thirties. The two moved to Blue Tower for Henry's new job at the power plant. While her husband is at work Rosie decides to unpack their belongings. The apartment is a duplex with a neighbor above them. While Henry is at work Rosie decides to walk around town and do some sightseeing. The city of Blue Tower is covered in smoke and fog and as she walks around the city Rosie cannot help but notice all the people with their faces covered up.

 

Rosie sees a fast-food restaurant called Frog Chicken and she goes inside to get something to eat. The girl behind the counter wears an orange and brown button-up shirt with a paper hat and asks if Rosie would like some chicken. The girl is a greenish pale with boils all over her face and as Rosie looks at the girl she loses her appetite. Rosie, who is a bit on the plump side orders a four-piece chicken breasts and wings with three sides. Rosie digs into her food and is disgusted by the taste of the chicken. ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE ANY CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD!"" She said. ""That's because it isn't chicken it's frog miss."" Said the girl behind the counter her face unchanged by the shocking news she just delivered.

 

Rosie throws the rest of her chicken out and demands a refund. The manager denies her a refund as the sign outside says Frog Chicken making it clear what they are selling. Rosie goes home and makes something sweet for her husband to enjoy for dinner. Henry comes home tired from a long day on the job, he offers his wife some frog chicken which she refuses, and he sits and eats alone in the kitchen. Henry, who is stressed from a long day at work, decides to unwind in front of the TV. Rosie tries to tell him about the strange encounter she had at Frog Chicken, but he brushes her off telling her that it is called Frog Chicken, what else could it be? The couple becomes disconnected over the next three months as Henry becomes grounded down by his job.

 

Rosie continues leaving the house every morning to explore the city. After her first month in the city, she discovers little Tokyo. Little Tokyo is a Japanese neighborhood in Blue Tower with a lot of delicious Japanese food and traditions. The people of Little Tokyo are kind and generous. Rosie loves spending her morning at the little Tokyo fish market. Today Rosie is picking up some fresh red snapper for her and Henry. The two haven't had dinner together in months as Henry chooses to spend most of his time either eating Frog Chicken in front of the TV or out with friends. As she is preparing the table for dinner Henry walks in with some friends from work. The two men have a greenish-pale complexion and thick bulging eyes.

 

Rosie asks Henry if his friends will be staying for dinner, and he responds with a comment about her weight. ""Listen here woman if I want my friends to stay for dinner it's none of your business."" Said Henry a vulgar tone in his voice. Sitting at the table by herself Rosie begins to cry. As she is crying alone in the kitchen one of Henry's friends comes into the kitchen and asks her what she made for dinner. Pointing to the fish Rosie explains that it is her husband's favorite meal. The man removes his thick black gloves, and Rosie can see his webbed fingers as he tears into the fish with his bare hands. The big man shoves pieces of fish into his mouth not accounting for any bones as he swallows the large chunks of fish whole. The man offers some of the fish to Rosie who politely refuses before he leaves and returns to the living room.

 

At midnight once Henry's friends have left Rosie and Henry go to bed the two sleep for about an hour before Henry gets a call and is forced to return to work. The next morning Rosie sits in bed eating chips when she gets a visit from her little brother Theo. Twenty-five-year-old Theo is a slacker who still lives with his mother and grandmother in Havana until now. ""I can't believe you're here."" She said holding her little brother tightly. ""Hola, big sister how has you been I've missed you."" He said. Theo asks his sister if he can stay for a while until he gets on his feet, and she asks him about their mother and grandmother. ""Momma remarried and grandma died almost a year ago, Momma's new husband doesn't want me around, so I need a place to stay."" He finished.

 

Rosie is excited to show her brother around Blue Tower. The two take the train to Little Tokyo to get some tempura and udon noodles. Theo is glad to try something new, but he does wish they knew how to make rice and beans like his grandmother. As he tries the tempura Theo loves the flavor and the more, he tries the less he misses his rice and beans. As they are leaving Rosie tells him that one of the servers is looking him up and down and her brother laughs and tells her that all women like him it is his curse. After eating and exploring the city a little Rosie and her brother return home to find Henry sleeping on the couch a bucket of Frog Chicken at his feet and a bottle of rum in his lap. ""Is everything alright with you two?"" Asked Theo. Rosie tells him everything is fine, and Henry has just had a long day at work and likes to unwind with a drink.

 

Rosie and Theo go to bed and sleep for the night. In the morning Theo fellows Henry to work as his brother-in-law and has made it clear that he cannot stay in his house without a job. The power plant is a massive structure with twin cooling towers on either side of a huge reactor. The men guarding the entrance are short, green-skinned men dressed like security guards. The bumpy-skinned men wave Henry and Theo into the power plant and order Henry to park his car in the auxiliary lot. After parking Henry and Theo head inside the two head to the HR department to speak with the head of HR and get Theo a job. The human resources department is full of crazy people men and women bouncing off the walls with energy as they drink gallons of an energy drink called Frog Sweat.

 

Henry leaves Theo to speak with the head of HR, Rick Ross and the big, Black, bald man with his gold chains and dark shades calls Theo into his office. ""So, you're the new hire huh?"" Asked Mr. Ross. Theo tells him that he's never worked in a power plant before, and he has no idea what he's doing. Mr. Ross lets Theo finish before telling him to report to the fifth floor and meet Hans the janitor. Hans is an older man with a salt-and-pepper mustache and a fading hairline. The old man tells Theo to grab a mop and help him clean the floors. ""So, this your first day, well I need you to remember one thing."" Said Hans taking a deep breath. ""What is it you want me to remember?"" Asked Theo. Hans lets out the breath he's holding and expels a massive fart before laughing at the top of his lungs.

 

Hans tells Theo to start on the first floor and work his way up. ""We'll meet in the middle somewhere on the third floor."" Said Hans. Theo spends hours cleaning the floor before he stops in to visit Henry. His brother-in-law is sitting in a cubicle masturbating to porn he drew himself. As he walks around the cubicle's all he sees are people slacking off and having sex instead of working. Hans catches up with Theo and laughs telling him that this is where the big bucks are. ""What do these people do anyway?"" Asked Theo. Hans explains that the third floor is where the call center is. It is the heart of the power plant, and it brings in all the money. ""These dicks just cold call people asking them if they want to switch to Froggy Power.

 

The entire power plant appears to be some insane asylum as no one is working and nothing is getting done. Theo asks Hans why they have to clean if no one else is working. ""Because we don't have high school diplomas."" He said. Hans tells Theo not to worry because they won't be working there for too long. Theo questions what his mentor is talking about, and Hans sends him back to work. For the next three weeks, Theo and Hans spend most of their days cleaning up around the power plant, until one day when Theo is called to the HR department. ""Maya this is Theo he's the head janitor and he'll be showing you the ropes for the next three weeks,"" said Mr. Ross. ""Can I ask what happened to Hans?"" Asks Theo.

 

 Mr. Ross explains that Hans is no longer with the company he handed in his resignation and is spending his time down south. Theo doesn’t understand but Mr. Ross appears to be done with the conversation, and he orders the two janitors away. Maya Lemon has a sweet-looking face with her caramel skin and light brown curly hair. She asks Theo how long he's been working at Froggy Power, and he tells her just three weeks. ""You've only worked here for three weeks and you're the head janitor?"" Asked Maya. ""I wasn't yesterday."" He replied. Maya is confused as to how Theo came to be in charge, but she tells him that she'll follow his orders as he is in charge. ""I want you to come with me while I clean someone's office."" He said leading her back to the HR department.

 

Theo and Maya wait until Mr. Ross goes to lunch before they enter his office. Walking past the deranged-looking employees that make up the HR department Theo and Maya walk into Mr. Ross's office and begin searching through his files. They search until they find Hans's file, Maya watches the door while Theo reads about Chapter 5. Chapter 5 a secret location somewhere within the power plant Theo grabs the file and the two leave. By the time Mr. Ross returns from lunch Theo and Maya have already left the HR department and are in the men's room together searching through Hans's files. Theo is shocked to learn that Hans only started working for the power plant one month before he started at the company.

 

Theo and Maya decide that they need to speak to someone about what is going on at the power plant and they decide to speak with Henry after work. Theo calls Rosie to ask if she's doing well and his sister tells him that she isn't feeling very well today, and she hasn't been able to get out of bed all day. Theo wants to tell his sister what is going on with her husband, but he isn't sure she can handle the news. Theo decides to question Henry before he tells his sister anything about what's going on. After work, Theo invites Maya to grab a drink with him and Henry at the frog bar.

 

Henry is drinking a green frothy liquor with his friends when Theo and Maya walk into the bar. The two sit at a table right next to the door and wait for Henry's friends to leave. Henry and his friends drink shot after shot of the green liquid until he passes out. Once Henry is unconscious his friends pick him up and drag him to his car. Theo asks Maya to follow them and the two head back to the power plant, where Henry's friends are pulling him out of his car. The two men then drag him into the power plant and to the fifth floor. Maya and Theo follow the two men keeping to the shadows as they don't want to be seen. ""Where are they taking him?"" Asked Maya, confused. The two men drag Henry over to a large garbage chute.

 

Back at home, Rosie is feeling sick, she begins to vomit and cry as if she needs a doctor. Lifting her shirt a small hand presses against her stomach and Rosie screams in horror. Passing out from fear Rosie wakes up in the hospital with a doctor she's never seen before telling her that she is pregnant. ""Doctor that's not possible I can't have children."" She explains to the doctor that she was born with only one ovary and was told she would never be able to have a child. The doctor, confused, tells Rosie that he is going to order some x-rays and blood work to verify her story and if everything checks out, he'll let her know what they can do next. As she sits in her bed crying at the thought of carrying a baby Rosie begins to wonder if this is why Henry agreed to move to Blue Tower.

 

Theo and Maya wait until the two men leave, once Henry's friends are gone, they see what happened to Henry. Theo calls out Henry's name and the unconscious man doesn't respond. Theo tells Maya to find some kind of rope and he heads down into the trash chute. The bottom of the garbage chute is a watery synthetic lake with stones and six feet of water. The underground lake appears to be at the lowest level of the power plant. Theo grabs Henry and pulls him up onto one of the rocks as the water begins to bubble. Poking its head out of the water a giant human-sized frog leaps onto a rock right by Theo and Henry and croaks loudly. The beast is a dark green with boils all over its skin. Theo looks at the monster and calls for help.

 

Henry opens his eyes to see dozens of frogmen holding spears and bows coming out of the water. One of the frogmen has a seashell horn which he blows into to play music. As the rhythmic music begins to fill the air Henry calls out to Theo telling him that he shouldn't have come to help him. ""THEY'RE GOING TO FUCKING EAT US!!"" He said crying. Theo asks Henry why he would move to this crazy city. Henry tells him that he moved here so he and Rosie could have a baby together. Theo is in shock to hear this as his sister has spent years seeing fertility specialists, all of whom told her she can't have children. Theo doesn't have time to wrap his head around what Henry just said as the frog people are moving closer to them every moment their spears in hand.

 

Henry gets up and tells Theo that they need to find a way out of the dump site. The two men argue about what they should do until a rope made of jackets and bed sheets comes down the garbage chute. The two men grab the rope and yell for Maya to pull them up. As the two men are lifted off the ground the frogmen rush toward them firing arrows made of gold and silver. Henry is hit with an Arrow in his side and almost lets go of the rope. Theo grabs his wrist and holds onto him while they are pulled to safety. Maya for her part is forced to pull for twenty minutes before she pulls Theo and Henry out of the Trash chute. Once reunited with her friends Maya and Theo carry Henry into one of the conference rooms to treat his wounds.

 

As they pull the arrows out of his side Maya can't help but notice that they are made of gold and silver. Maya goes to find a first-aid kit to patch up Henry. ""Listen to me, these monsters want to take over the world they need people like us for breeding."" Said Henry blood gushing from his mouth. Henry tells Theo to be careful because he saw how Maya looked at the gold arrow and that is how they convince people to join them. ""Don't worry about Maya she'll be fine we just need to get you somewhere safe for right now."" Said Theo. He waits for Maya to bring the first-aid kit and once she does, they begin patching him up.

 

Theo and Maya who are parked in the auxiliary lot, cover up Henry before driving away from the power plant. The two drive to Maya's house in a part of the city called Throgs Neck. The streets of Throgs Neck are deserted at 4 am. Maya and Theo carry Henry into Maya's house and lay him down on the couch. The two discuss what happened while Theo was down in the garbage chute, and he tells her about the frogmen. ""That's insane who the hell would believe that story?"" Asked Maya trying to figure out who might believe them. Theo tells Maya they must be careful who they trust as they don't know who is working with the frog people.

 

The next morning after falling asleep in Maya's bed with her Theo checks his massages and sees that his sister is in the hospital. Leaving Henry in the care of Maya, Theo tells her not to go to work today. He tells her that the two of them will call in sick and get ready to quit. Henry, still in pain, warns Theo and Maya not to quit. ""They'll feed you to the frogmen if you quit, they never leave loose ends."" Said Henry. Theo tells Maya and Henry not to worry because they will produce a plan once they have enough time to think straight. Theo leaves to see his sister, leaving Henry and Maya together for the next few hours. Maya changes Henry's bandages before going to make him something to eat.

 

Theo visits his sister in the hospital to discover that she has somehow become nine months pregnant. ""Big sister, what is happening to you?"" Asked Theo crying as he held his sister's hand. Rosie’s doctor Neal Patrick Harris tells Theo that his sister is experiencing a hysterical pregnancy and will need to remain in the hospital for a while. ""ARE YOU CRAZY LOOK AT HER STOMACH THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN THERE!!"" Said Theo grabbing the doctor by his collar and shaking him. Doctor Harris tells Theo to calm down unless he wants to be thrown out of the hospital and arrested for assault. Theo breaks down crying as he begs the doctor to help his sister. ""Listen if your sister is in pain I might be able to sedate her,"" said Doctor Harris.

 

Theo gets up off the floor and whips his eyes Rosie who is gaunt everywhere but her stomach smiles and tells Theo that she wants him to help raise the baby. ""THIS BABY IS KILLING YOU!!"" He said. Rosie, who has always wanted to be a mother, tells Theo that if he loves her, he will take care of her child and make sure the baby wants for nothing. As tears roll down his face Theo watches the life drain from his sister as she screams and doctors come rushing to her side. The doctor orders Theo out of the room and he returns to Maya's house to discover that Maya isn't home. Henry is sitting up on the couch eating a sandwich when Theo arrives. The two discuss Rosie's condition and Henry asks Theo to help him take care of his son or daughter.

 

Theo has so much to unpack with all that's happened to him in the past few days. Henry asks Theo to drive him to the hospital saying that he needs to be with his wife in her time of need. ""Alright I'll drive you we can take your car."" Said Theo. As he opens the door to Maya's house fifteen green-skinned men with pipes and chains bust through the back door and grab hold of Henry. Theo quickly grabs one of the green frog-like men and cracks his skull with an ashtray sitting on Maya's coffee table. The fifteen croakers are able to overwhelm Henry and Theo just as Maya enters the room. Maya is dressed in a golden dress with a bow strapped to her back. The girl smiles down at Theo and Henry who are being held down by the croakers.

 

Maya holds a gold nugget the size of her fist in one hand, and she slams it down on the coffee table before saying to Theo. ""This isn't how I wanted this to happen I'm sorry, but these frog people are going to take over the world anyway why not help them?"" Maya tries twice to convince Theo to join the dark side before giving up and ordering the croakers to remove the two from her house. Theo and Henry are dragged into a paddy wagon and driven to the power plant. Once they arrive at the plant Henry's wounds are treated properly and he is given time to rest. Theo meanwhile is dragged before Rick Ross and forced to answer for his betrayal. ""So, I understand that you aren't enjoying your employment here at Froggy Power."" Said Mr. Ross.

 

The big man gets up his belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly and he kicks Theo in the chest. ""Consider this your exit interview."" He finished. Mr. Ross grabs Theo and drags him to the garbage chute before tossing him down the chute. Down in the manmade lake, Theo is being dragged to his feet by a group of Frogmen. The pimply frog people drag Theo down into a tunnel where they command him to dig. All around him in the tunnel people are frightened and disheveled as they are forced to dig into the earth for some unknown reason. The tunnel is being dug into sections and levels with the highest-level being level 1 and the lowest being level 10. Theo is at the lowest level and as water begins to spill into the tunnel from the lake many others around him begin to drown. More than once one of the other people down in the pit with him tries to drown him so they can stay afloat.

 

Henry meanwhile is taken to the hospital where he is allowed to meet his daughter Ivy. The girl has green skin and boils all over her body and Henry cries as he looks at her. ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY WIFE?"" Asked Henry throttling one of the doctors. Mr. Ross, sitting in a chair next to his dead wife's body laughs and tells Henry that he's been eating too much frog chicken. The man orders the doctors to sedate Henry and take him to the breeding floor where he will be used as a stud. ""YOU SON OF A BITCH, I'LL KILL YOU!!"" Henry yelled as he was being dragged away.

 

Henry is taken to the hospital's mental ward and locked up with other men and women who will be used for breeding. A voice in Henry's head tells him that he is going to die so he might as well kill himself. Searching his pockets for anything he could use to kill himself Henry finds a pocketknife and some pills. Using the knife, he grounds up the pills to a fine powder and before he can take the powder up the nose the image of his wife comes to him, and she tells him that he needs to be there for Ivy. ""I CAN'T, I CAN'T PLEASE JUST LET ME GO!"" He said crying into his sleeves.

 

Maya Lemon is now working on the executive floor where she is surrounded by sycophants and lick spittles. Maya is second in command to the chancellor who commands the armies of the underwater kingdom. According to the chancellor, when the time comes for the frogs to rise, he will lead their armies to victory against the human scum. The chancellor is a man in his fifties with thick blonde hair and light green skin he like most of the croakers worships the god Dagon. As she surveys the power plant wondering if selling out the human race was worth becoming a servant to a race of frog people, Maya begins to think about Theo. Tonight Maya is meeting with Mr. Ross to discuss some new hires that the chancellor wants fast-tracked.

 

Mr. Ross is the only one working in the HR department as the rest of his team has been downsized. Maya tells Mr. Ross to fast-track the twelve hires that the chancellor wants hired but she also asks him for a favor. It takes a few days for Mr. Ross to get back to her but once he does, he explains that he can in fact get her the thing she is asking for. ""Good have it delivered to my mansion by 6 pm and be careful not to disturb my swans."" Said Maya. After talking with Mr. Ross, Maya returns to the fifth floor to receive her next assignment. For the rest of the day, Maya is allowed to sit at her desk and watch TV on her phone as the chancellor has no need of her. The chancellor goes to church to pray to the sea god Dagon that all will go as expected before going home for the day.

 

With the chancellor gone Maya takes her chance and goes to the lake she orders one of the frogmen to bring her Theo so they can speak. The spiky-eyed frogman does as he is told and goes to fetch Theo. Finding a beaten down and dirty Theo gaunt from a lack of food and fresh water the frogman drags him before Maya and leaves the two to speak in private. Theo who is weak from hunger can barely stand up on his own when Maya makes her offer. ""How would you like to walk out of this place and see your niece for the first time since she's been born?"" she asked. Theo breaks down crying at the thought of seeing his niece, but he refuses to owe Maya a favor, so he tells her to fuck off. ""I understand if you think I'm lying but I can assure you that Ivy is in my care."" She finished showing Theo a picture of the baby.

 

Henry wakes up after being forced to breed over one hundred times in less than a month. Most of the women are croakers who have green skin and pimples all over their bodies a handful are young women that range from 21-14. Henry is disgusted with himself and what these frogs have turned him into, he and the rest of the breeders are kept confined for 23 hours a day only being allowed out of their cells to shower and eat. Today Henry is sitting in the shower crying when one of the croakers tells him to hurry up so that someone else can shower. After waiting for twenty minutes for him to get out of the shower a couple of croakers with Billy clubs enter the shower and order Henry on his feet. Henry, who has a blank stare on his face ignores the two croakers and continues sitting under the water.

 

One of the croakers a blueish-green man with a wispy mustache pulls Henry to his feet and is rewarded for his trouble with an elbow to the face. As green blood flows from his nose the frogman's partner raises his club to attack Henry. But before he can Henry tackles him to the ground and pries the Billy club from his hand before bringing it down on the croaker's head. The croaker with the broken nose begs for his life and pleads with Henry not to kill him before he too is beaten to death. Escaping the showers naked Henry runs past almost a dozen men and women who beg him to take them with him. ""I don’t even know where I'm going."" Said Henry trying to convince the rest of the breeders not to follow him. With even more croakers coming Henry decides he might need some help escaping so he orders the rest of the breeders to arm themselves with weapons from the armory.",1,1736297096.0,shortstorywriting,0,1.0,False

I (31M) and partner (28F) - How Do I Reclaim My Relationship After My Girlfriend's 'Best Friend' Took Over or make this poly relationship ago with some rules?

My name is Alex. I’m 31 (Bi), and my wife Evie, who’s 28 (Bi), and I have been married for nearly four years, together for seven. We met on Bumble in 2017, and from the moment I met her, I knew she was someone special. Evie’s the kind of person who naturally draws people in, funny, sharp, and effortlessly cool. I fell for her hard and fast.

Early in our relationship, Evie confided in me that she’s bisexual. I was the first person she told, and I stood by her side when she came out to her parents. Thankfully, they were accepting, and it brought us even closer. Our relationship was built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect, and I always felt secure in the life we were building together.

Over the years, we would joke about her attraction to women. We would sit in coffee shops, pointing out women we thought were cute. Occasionally, the topic of a threesome would come up, but it was always light-hearted. We weren’t actively pursuing anything like that; it was more of a “what if” fantasy. I never felt like it was something we would actually explore.

But everything started to shift in mid-2023, when Keira, one of Evie’s new co-workers, entered our lives. Keira initially came across as friendly and confident, a typical new colleague. I didn’t think much of it when Evie started spending more time with her, grabbing drinks after work, texting more often, and occasionally inviting her over. Evie had been feeling a bit isolated since we moved in 2022, so I was glad to see her making a new friend.

When I first met Keira in person, I could tell she wasn’t just some casual friend. She was charismatic, with a natural charm that made people feel at ease. She identifies as queer (anything but straight). One evening, when we were all having drinks at home, the conversation turned playful, and we touched on the idea of a threesome. It was more of a joke at first, but there was an energy in the room that made it clear we weren’t just talking hypotheticals anymore.

A few days later, Keira approached me privately. She admitted that she had feelings for Evie but didn’t want to disrupt our marriage. She respected our boundaries and asked if it was okay to share those feelings with Evie. I appreciated her honesty. It felt like a rare kind of openness. After thinking it over, I gave her my blessing, under the condition that everything stayed above-board and Evie and I maintained open communication.

At first, things felt manageable. Evie was transparent about her feelings, and Keira made an effort to include me, making sure I never felt left out or sidelined. They started exploring their connection, which led to us having a threesome at one point. It was meant to be a shared experience, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Evie and Keira were more focused on each other than on me. Still, I tried to see it as part of our journey, something we were navigating together.

Over the next few months, Keira became a constant presence in our lives. She would come over for dinner, spend nights on our couch, and even join us for outings. By October 2024, her lease was ending, and Evie asked if she could move in temporarily. I hesitated at first, unsure of how this would affect our dynamic. But after several honest conversations, I agreed.

Once Keira moved in, our lives became more intertwined. The boundaries we had initially set became blurrier. Evie and I still had our moments together, whether it was date nights or quiet evenings spent talking about the future. But Keira was always there, an ever-present part of our household. It wasn’t long before her clothes started showing up in the laundry, her favourite snacks appeared in our pantry, and her toothbrush found a permanent spot in our bathroom.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t struggle with it at times. There were nights when I came home from work trips and found Evie and Keira curled up on the couch, or worse, sharing our bed. They assured me it wasn’t meant to push me out, and I tried my best to believe them. I knew Evie loved me, and I didn’t want my insecurities to cloud our relationship.

Things came to a head in December 2024, when we got news that should have been the happiest moment of our lives. Evie was pregnant. After months of trying, we were finally going to be parents. For a brief moment, it felt like everything would fall into place. Evie was radiant, her excitement infectious as we talked about baby names and started planning for the nursery.

But the joy was short-lived. One evening, Evie and Keira sat me down for a serious talk. Evie, with tears in her eyes, admitted that her feelings for Keira had deepened. She was in love with her, but she also insisted that her love for me hadn’t changed. She wanted to find a way for the three of us to coexist as a family. Keira stayed quiet, but her presence alone made the weight of the moment unbearable.

It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me. I was hurt, confused, and unsure of where I stood in all of this. But I could see how much Evie was struggling, torn between her love for me and her feelings for Keira. She begged me to understand, to give her time to figure things out. Despite my heartbreak, I told her I was willing to try, or her, for us, and for the baby.

We agreed to keep the lines of communication open and to set boundaries that worked for all of us. Over the next few months, we tried to navigate this new reality. Some days were easier than others. I could see how happy Evie was with Keira, but I couldn’t help feeling like a bystander in my own marriage.

By the time Keira fully integrated into our lives, it was clear that this wasn’t just a phase or a temporary arrangement. Evie’s love for Keira was real, and so was her commitment to me. We even revisited the idea of a threesome, not as a solution to our problems, but as a way to deepen the connection between all of us. It wasn’t perfect, but it helped us feel more united, even if only briefly.

We’ve had a lot of conversations about how this dynamic would work when it comes to parenting. Keira has expressed that she wants to take an active role in raising our child, not just as Evie’s girlfriend but as someone deeply invested in the family we’re building. She wants to contribute emotionally, financially, and practically—essentially co-parenting alongside us.

It’s a lot to wrap my head around. I see how much Evie and Keira care for each other, and I can tell Keira is genuine about wanting to be a part of our child’s life. Will I still feel like an equal partner? Will we be able to maintain healthy boundaries while raising a child in such an unconventional setup?

These are questions we’re still working through, but I want to give this a fair shot. At the end of the day, the most important thing is creating a stable, loving environment for our child. If we can figure out a way to make this work, with clear communication and mutual respect, maybe this can be a version of family that works for all of us.

It’s not what I imagined when Evie and I started our journey together, but life rarely plays out the way you expect. I’m learning to embrace the unexpected and focus on what truly matters: love, support, and the commitment to making this family as strong as it can be.",1,1736297092.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He said it feels too intense and we should slow down. I thought we were fwb or something similar and I’ve been sleeping with my housemate (26F),"So we met at a social gathering for postgrads before Xmas, he knew my friend really well and asked for my number. Some context; I haven’t dated men for 5 years, and for the last 2 years I had been calling myself a lesbian. We talked a little, but he didn’t seem like a big texter, and he immediately asked me out for drinks. I said yes, we go out a couple days later, it seemed supppper casual (we went to Wetherspoons, which brits will know as a shitty cheap chain pub, but he had suggested a nicer hipster place, which we went to after). We talked for ages, made out, I propositioned him, he said he hadn’t been expecting it, but we went back to his and I stayed the night. It did not feel like one night stand vibes, and we talked about me not dating men for ages, and being in a place where I’d like to explore, and he also said he was seeing other people. I took this as us agreeing to be casually seeing each other. 
A couple days later, my housemate (26F) confessed to having a crush on me while we were drunk, I had a big crush on her a couple months ago, and I was down to see what would happen.
It’s been like three weeks, he and I have hung out like 3 times and spent the night each time, and I told him about my flatmate, he seemed chill with it. I finally slept with her a couple days ago, then hung out with him the same day, told him about it, he still stayed over.
Cut to this weekend. He asked if it would be weird if he came into the cafe I work at and I said no, I’d sneak him a free coffee. Admittedly I am a really touchy person and I did kiss him when he came into, but I asked first! Maybe that felt too much?
So I went on a hike with some friends, and I asked him if he’d be down to hang out after, he seemed super excited and was texting back more than usual but when I got to his he said he didn’t have the energy to be social after we kissed on the sofa a little and I went home. He text me after and apologised and asked to meet today, since it was sooner, when I told him I was free. He made dinner, we played video games and watched a movie, and I am a really touchy person so I was kissing him a fair amount, I thought this was going down the same track as every other time we hang out? He says he wants to be open and communicate and that he wants to spend the night alone. I’m so glad he feels comfortable enough to tell me, and that he’s so upfront with me. I text him when I get home to say thanks for dinner, and I get a message asking to slow down because it had been feeling too intense and coupley too quickly. I had been finding it kind of intense and I didn’t know how i felt about it, so I’m glad he said something. We have a coffee date next Sunday and I don’t know how to act. Do I kiss him hello? Do I ask about the line? Or do I forget that it ever happened and treat it like a new first date?
I find him so interesting and I would be down to just be friends, but i said that and he said he wasn’t rejecting me romantically, he just wants to slow down. Does that mean he’s looking for something more serious than I am?",0,1736296893.0,relationship_advice,2,0.33,False

However, over time, carpets endure heavy foot traffic, stains, and dirt buildup that can leave them looking dull and lifeless. [Professional carpet cleaning in Vancouver](https://www.nmfloorcare.com/post/how-professional-carpet-cleaning-extends-the-life-of-your-carpets)  can breathe new life into your carpets and, in turn, refresh the entire look of your home. Here’s how:

# 1. Restoring Your Carpet’s Original Appearance

Dirt, dust, and grime often settle deep into carpet fibers, making them appear faded and worn. Professional carpet cleaning services use advanced techniques like hot water extraction or steam cleaning to remove stubborn debris, restoring your carpet’s original colors and texture.

Regular professional cleaning prevents wear and tear caused by dirt and debris. By keeping your carpets clean and well-maintained, you can significantly extend their lifespan, saving you money on replacements in the long run.

UC = Ulcerative colitis 

Hello all. I've been following keto for a week now. Drank my last champange 1 minute before midnight on the 31 of Dec.
My new year resolution is to be keto for a year and then if my UC showed no symtoms I would continue.

I've had UC since i was 14. I probably received it from bad eating habits. I almost never ate the food in school. I would go to the store to buy a plain white baguette and some candy instead. Today my understanding of food is probably close to dietitian level. 

For about a year now my UC has been in aloot of ups and downs, never really healing fully and it showed on my colonoscopy. It wasn't bad though, but not good enough. Sometimes I have diarreah and sometimes I do not, but never a solid regular stool.
I am on 6 tablets of asacol 800mg a day, max dosage.

Day 1. I went fasting almost the whole day. Ate some stew in the evening. Somewhat loose stool x1.
Day 2. I think this was the day my water got drained. Diarreah x2
Day 3. Somewhat solid stool
Day 4-7. Solid stool. As in regular person stool. First time in a year.

I only drink coffee in the morning and I have my first meal at 11 am. No restriction yet on when i stop eating for the day. So I cant say I'm practicing any intermittent fasting.

Favourite foods so far:
*Chocolate balls: coconut flakes, butter, cacao, unflavoured whey protein, sunflower seeds, coffe.
*Carnitas - almond flower tortillas: Almond flower, baking soda, psyllium husk, salt, water, egg.
*Dumplings: cabbage and filling.

Supplements: zink, omega 3, d vitamin, c vitamin.

I'm not taking out any victory yet.

**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 107 brings us to ""Red in Tooth and Claw,"" which starts with Lisbon at her poker game. Judge Manchester schools Bertram, which puts him in a foul mood. Lisbon gets a call about a body at the Museum of Natural History at NorCal University, the second time they've worked a case here. The dean of the Natural Sciences department leads Lisbon and Jane to a lab, where they look at a disgusting body being fed upon by flesh-eating bugs. Lisbon is so grossed out she faints, and Jane attempts to catch her.

Title relevance: The phrase ""red in tooth and claw"" means to behave savagely in competition with one another.

Notable guest stars: Dakin Matthews (from True Grit and The Gilded Age), Samantha Quan (from Elementary), John Rubenstein (from The Young and the Restless), Zuleikha Robinson (from LOST and Homeland)


Location: NorCal University


Notable scenes: 
- A missing persons report was filed for the victim by a professor at the university, and Lisbon and Jane go to talk to her. She tells them about her program, which is fiercely competitive. The team begins questioning each of them.
- They learn the victim Linda reportedly had a boyfriend who was a cop.
- Lisbon requests funds to send Grace to a White Hat training program for a month in LA (which is the story they use for actress Amanda Righetti to have her baby), but he rejects it, still in a bad move over poker.
- Jane returns from the museum bearing gifts, giving Cho a triceratops toy and leaving a T-rex for Rigsby. On their way to talk to Linda's cop boyfriend, they walk in on the cops investigating a robbery at a convenience store. Jane catches the clerk in a lie, figuring out the clerk was stealing from his boss, thus freeing up the boyfriend. He tells them that they broke up when he thought he was cheating on him.
- Grace does some digging and figures out that someone pretended to be Linda and broke up Linda and her boyfriend. Jane reads the fake profile and enlists Cho and Rigsby to go play bingo with the students. (Fun fact: this scene in the rose garden is the same place that was used for the exterior of the Jeffersonian Institute in Bones.) Jane wins bingo with one of the female students.
- Jane goes to see Bertram and offers to help him improve in poker. He studies him for a bit and then tells him Manchester is reading a tell within his fake tell.
- Jane puts on a memory seminar for Professor Kidd's class. He requests a lot of dead-animal props. He calls Cho and Rigsby, who are at the office arguing about which of their dinosaurs is superior. Cho tells Rigsby Jane needs them for a museum heist.
- Jane nicks a specimen from the museum floor and uses it and a memory recall performance (with Lisbon as his ""magician's assistant"") to catch the killer: Paul, one of the male students. 
- Sonia Kidd comes to the CBI to lament what happened to Linda and her program. She expresses interest in Jane, but she notices his wedding ring and says, ""All the good ones are taken.""
- At the next poker game, Bertram is able to win with Jane's information, and this puts him in such a good mood that he approves Grace's training stipend.
- The next day, Rigsby shows up with a wealth of facts to show why the T-rex is better than the triceratops. He puts a coffee on Grace's desk, not realizing she's left for a month. Cho tells Rigsby he's a coward and that he's still in love with Van Pelt.
- Jane waits in Lisbon's office, and he says that since he's helped Bertram improve, he has to help her improve, and they play with his dinosaur gummies from the museum gift shop.

When COVID happened, I returned home and left China. I kept in touch with that guy online, and we got along really well. I even fell in love with him.

Now, he’s not considering a relationship at all. I’m struggling with severe depression due to losing my job, mobbing, and my parents' constant complaints.

Maybe someone can learn from my (somewhat embarrassing) experience...

First off, I severely underestimated how much water I'd need on a sunny day. Sure, I was surrounded by water, but unless you're a fan of the salty variety, that doesn't help much. My 1L bottle was basically empty and I still had half the journey to go.

But the real crisis? I had to pee. BAD. Like, really bad. And let me tell you, those calm waters from the morning had picked up into a decent chop, making any attempt at the ""kayaker's shuffle"" (you know what I mean) pretty much impossible without taking a swim.

To make matters worse, the next viable landing spot was a good hour away, and the cliffs along this section offered zero options for emergency stops. Started seriously reconsidering all my life choices that led to this moment... (Note to self: coffee before a long paddle is NOT your friend)

The silver lining? This experience taught me some valuable lessons about coastal kayaking that I now religiously follow:

* Always pack more water than you think you need (I now do 1L per 2 hours minimum)
* Scout landing spots BEFORE your trip
* Practice self-rescue in choppy conditions (because when nature calls, you'll be grateful for the skills)
* Consider a ""plan B"" route with more exit points

Happy paddling, folks! And remember, we all learn the hard way sometimes...

Most recently she ghosted me for about 9 days, from our most recent date until the other day. She told me she’d been ghosting me because of some mental health issues and because trauma related to an ex had caused her difficulty to date. I responded saying that I understood, that it’s awful what she’s going through, and that I also had a trauma related to an ex years ago which took a while to overcome, wanted to communicate that there’s no pressure or judgement from me. I also offered to grab a coffee sometime. When she replied she said she’d like to see me again.

Obviously not an ideal situation if she’s ghosted me twice before. But given this new information I’d be willing to just see where a friendship or casual thing led. I’m not in a rush to settle down or anything, and frankly the sex was extremely good haha.

If you're new here, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hlkxut/mass_review_16/) is a link to my first review.

Without further ado, get reading! Let me know your thoughts, I'm always happy to hear your feedback!

Thanks, everyone. I appreciate y'all :)

**BOIS 1920**

*Classic 1920:* Intrigued by the notes of apricot and basil, I was excited to try *Classic 1920.* The opening is bright, showcasing the juniper and bergamot, a slight bitter, but aromatic profile of basil, and a nice dash of spicy sweetness from the nutmeg. As time passes, the fragrance fades into a nice, classic, slightly barbershop fragrance. The florals in the middle keep it sweet, but not too powdery, in my opinion. It remained fresh. On the base, the fragrance grounds itself with some woodiness, though not overwhelmingly. On my skin, it stayed pretty fresh and sweet throughout its lifespan. Speaking of which, the longevity and projection are not great, maybe 4-6 hours best? Not abysmal, but not particularly substantial, unless you don’t mind reapplication. Overall, this fragrance does have a classically posh, gentleman-like feel to it. **(6/10)**

**HOUSE OF BŌ**

*Infinitoud:* Truthfully, I got my nose on this because I needed a filler for the month of December on my ScentBird subscription. Now, I have made my fair share of mistakes in life, but this, ladies and gentleman… this was not one of them. I was completely taken aback by how much I enjoyed this fragrance. It was simply, *incredible*. The opening is beautiful. Based on the described notes, one could assume this is a very woody, earthy, natural fragrance from start to finish, and while those aromas may reveal themselves later, that is not the case in the opening. The peyote and myrrh, in unison, create such a unique, fresh, aromatic, herbaceous, sweetness to the top of this stunning fragrance. Later, as expected, the fragrance melds into a woody, seductive, oriental scent that exudes sophistication and discretion. The longevity is good and the projection is not beastly, which I prefer. Overall, I am over the moon to have found this, though I cannot say the same about the price… **(10/10)**

**ARAMIS**

*Havana:* I am still hoping, one day, I will be able to own a bottle of *Tobacco Reserve.* However, until then, I was satisfied to try *Havana.* Inspired by the Cuban city itself, I expected certain things: a classically masculine aroma, prevalent tobacco, and a timeless feel. While the tobacco is understated, taking a back seat to other prominent players, the timelessness and masculinity made themselves known. The mandarin, basil, and spiciness on the opening is pleasant and fresh. The carnation is a key note in this fragrance, giving it a classic, floral, sweetness, almost reminiscent of a fougère. Overall, *Havana* is a fresh, classic, masculine, and timeless fragrance. Its longevity is good. The projection is beastly at the beginning, but clams down over time. **(7.5/10)**

**LORENZO VILLORESI**

*Atman Xaman:* I will start with what I know: The longevity is great and the projection, though not beastly, is noticeable, and becomes intimate over time. I will admit, I had a hard time pinning this fragrance. I was eager to try it, as it’s noted to be tobacco heavy, but it was not what I expected. *Atman Xaman* had an old-world, dusty, forgotten, slightly pungent smell to it. I reminded me of an ancient library, but with a warm, sandy, desert, mysterious undertone. It was not deterring, however, like I’ve noticed from Lorenzo Villoresi, he takes you on a different ride than you expected. I wish I could pin more of the notes and profiles for reviewing purposes, but I don’t want to be dishonest or lead you astray. My description above is the best I can do. I will say, the mate did com through for me, not overwhelmingly, but it was the only note I felt I could actually identify among the mysterious aroma. Overall, I enjoyed this. It felt masculine and sensual, due to its mysterious disposition. I wonder how many times I can say “mysterious” in a review lol **(7/10)**

*Spezie: Spezie* was like nothing I had smelled before; it really pushed me. Based on its description, I expected a heavily spicy aroma. And that is what I got... well, in one way or another. Let me break this down for you. You see, I break “spicy” down into three categories: 1. Spicy: food that hurts the tongue and makes your eyes water. 2. Spice-filled: tasting/smelling various spices, without the hurt of the heat. Think: cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, turmeric, etc. 3. Spicy (fragrance): spice, in association to fragrance, is usually more crowd-pleasing, aiding other prominent notes in the scent. These could also include cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., but it is less risk-taking. *Spezie* fell into the second category. The first spray knocked me back, not because it was bad, but because it was truly a new experience. I thought I was transported to an eastern spice bazaar. It was spicy, salty, herby, aromatic, and transportive. It is definitely not for the weak of heart, or the conventional “spicy-fragrance” lover. I cannot emphasize enough how real the spices smelled. You could have been holding a bowl of bay leaves under my nose an I would’ve believed you. After the heavy spices died down, you are left with a lighter, spicy, aromatic, sweet/fresh, intimate, scent. The longevity is pretty good. I am rating this off of my preference, but I really learned a lot from *Spezie* and it felt artistic and creative. **(5/10)**

*Theseus:* The opening is fresh and citrusy. It fades into a woody, soapy, lightly floral, and SLIGHTLY spice-filled fragrance. The woodiness isn’t strong, nor are the other notes, in fact, it’s quite a light fragrance, and didn’t seem to last too long. I couldn’t make out many of the listed notes. Mr. Villoresi’s creations seem to each have a unique spice-filled quality, leading me to believe it’s part of the house DNA. That would make sense, considering he uses his travels to the East for inspiration. I’ve already spoken on what kind of spiciness is utilized within his perfumes, you can see *Spezie* above. The longevity was very mild, so was the projection. Not my favorite from Villoresi **(3/10)**

**TUMI**

*Kinetic:* This fragrance falls into the same category as *Eros Flame* by Versace, which I have already reviewed. It has that strong, mass-appealing aroma, one that can make your throat dry if you breathe it in too much. Strangely, my nose got a cola scent upon its first spray. The associations we make with fragrances can be questionable sometimes, but I must be honest. Anyways, after I got the cola idea out of my head, difficult as it was, I tried to smell *Kinetic* for what it was. Truthfully, it’s nothing special. If you have *Sauvage* or those alike, you don’t need this. Comparatively, this one leans a bit sweeter, fruitier. My biggest issue with these types of fragrances is that that they are terribly synthetic smelling. It can feel like you’re inhaling straight chemicals. It has strong projection for about an hour. The longevity is pretty good. I want to note: this is *not* bad smelling by any means, however it is just not for me. **(2/10)**

**DAVIDOFF**

*Cool Water:* The current formulation of *Cool Water* seems very different from what it ought to smell like based on its described notes. It felt a lot more linear than what I am, seemingly, supposed to smell. Let me start off by saying, it is not bad. It has a cool feeling to it (no pun intended). I also commend its contribution to the progression of fragrance, being one of the first aquatics introduced to the world. I think I would’ve liked for it to be softer. It seemed to lean a bit “axe body spray,” which feels sacrilegious to say knowing its spot among the greats. Which is why I must also say, I would love to have given this a true chance by testing its original formulation. Can’t win them all I guess. Overall, the projection is good and the longevity seemed alright. I think (and hope) that the version I am smelling is a victim to reformulation and high demand, causing it to be a lesser version of its original. However, I will be basing this off of what I smelled. **(3/10)**

**4160 TUESDAYS**

*Maxed Out:* At first, I did not care for this fragrance whatsoever. It opened terribly boozy, which was disconcerting, jading my idea of what this fragrance could become. However, after spending more time with it, I fell in love, y’all. In. Love. Here is what I gathered about the smell: The opening is definitely rum-filled, backed up with lime and a hint of coconut. After that, the lime lingers, and the booziness leaves quickly (thankfully). It dries into an extremely sensual scent, in my opinion. The musk in the base is what makes this fragrance a standout. With the lime, coconut, rum, and tobacco, you may assume this fragrance to be gourmand-like. But I promise you, it is not. It does have a slight sweetness, but with the nuances of woods, cannabis, and spices, grounded by the musk, you get a smooth, masculine, and seductive scent. It reminds me of, and seems most appropriate for, a warm summer night, maybe at a classy beach front resort. Warm, dim lights are strung from linen canopies, the moon shines on the ocean, and you can hear the fresh, salty waves just across the sandy beach. A tall, dark stranger walks by, barefoot in the sand, wearing a linen shirt exposing his chest. The light breeze flows through his dark hair as he walks by, leaving a discreetly intoxicating and sensual trail behind him. Phew, is it getting hot in here? I hope that’s enough imagery for you, because that was getting awkward, though I would give my left arm to be him. Because, he is, in fact: *him.* Projection and longevity are good! **(8.5/10)**

**ANDY TAUER**

*Sundowner:* This one took me for a *bumpy* ride. Upon hearing about how tobacco-heavy this fragrance was, I knew I had to get my hands on it. Christmas came, and with it, so did a 5ml sample of *Sundowner.* Whoop Whoop! I open the vial, take a whiff, and… well, I was unsure. It was not bad, but I wasn’t elated like I hoped I would be. So, as one does, I spent some time with it, wore it out. Luckily, it grew on me. I thought my nose was broken because I had difficulty getting a lot of the nuances described in this fragrance. I could, however, get a very heavy, dry tobacco scent. Then I stopped liking it. Again. It felt very one dimensional. I was getting frustrated. But, wait! There’s more! Today, on my fourth round of wearing it, I am enjoying it! I didn’t realize Mr. Tauer’s approach to fragrance was very heavy on natural, ethical ingredients, a lot of which are oils, essential oils, and absolutes. That helped me understand what I was smelling and appreciate its composition. Overall, I approve of this (not that anyone is looking for my approval). I really enjoy the classic, dry tobacco. The sparkling orange on the opening, for as long as it lasts, adds a nice touch, and I have now begun to identify some underlying notes, such as cocoa. Longevity is good. The projection is not crazy, which I enjoy. **(7.4/10)**

**FRANCESCA BIANCHI** 

*The Dark Side:*  2erf2This fragrance opens *very* honey-heavy. If you’ve read my reviews before, you know that honey and I don’t jive. Lucky, the honey doesn’t remain too forward for very long. It was a dark honey, not a light honey, I thought I should mention that. Anyways, this fragrance has a dark, slightly dirty, sweetness to it. The spices are aromatic and fragrant, giving some nice depth and support to the obvious sweetness. Once the strength of the honey subsides, the florals continue the sweetness throughout, though the honey still lingers. The blend from honey to the florals is very well done, it’s hard to notice a distinct change. The incense is noticeable, adding some darkness to the composition. Woods can be detected later, though they aren’t prevalent. The projection isn’t too strong, but the longevity is good. This fragrance reminds me of a night out in a sleazy, underground club, getting drunk, walking home in a damp fog, getting grimy from it. Overall, I enjoyed spending time with this fragrance, but it isn’t to my particular taste. **(4.7/10)**

*Sticky Fingers:* If *The Dark Side* and *Sticky Fingers* are sisters, the former is the dark one (shocker), and the later is the good sister. Both open with, what I am coming to find, may be Miss Bianchi’s signature. I don’t quite know how to describe it, but they do have similar DNA. Bear with me, but it reminds me of eating spiced baklava. Don’t think “sickly sweet pastry,” but try to envision what it smells like to eat each texture and taste each flavor. Riveting, I know. Anyways, while *The Dark Side* is more dirty and deep, *Sticky Fingers* is lighter. It is still sweet, though instead of deep sweetness, it felt brighter. The florals may help with this, and there is no honey, which can add a heaviness to fragrances. I found this fragrance to be *very* well blended. I enjoyed it more than the former. The projection is intimate and the longevity is great. Overall, not my go-to but a solid fragrance. **(6.1/10)**

**EIGHT & BOB**

*Nuit de Megève:* I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. This**GEORGE** is a moment that I must remind myself: fragrance is subjective. With that being said, *Nuit de Megève* smelled very heavily of menthol/eucalyptus. That may seem mundane for my introduction, though I implore you to research how it’s marketed, specifically the listed notes. You will notice that the desired effect is quite opposite of my experience. For me, *Nuit de Megève* opened with citrus on the top, though it was a bit screechy. However, what followed was strange. A strong cooling blast of eucalyptus/menthol came through. I cannot explain it another way. Fortunately, I didn’t mind. I thought it was a clean smell. I was able to pick up on some vetiver later, though the cooling sensation was prevent throughout. The projection was fine and the longevity was about six hours long. Though unexpected, I wasn’t devastated. **(5/10)**

*Cap d’Antibes:* Ironically, this fragrance is actually meant to display cooling properties, not the former. The mint is a very nice opening to this fragrance, well-blended with violet and birch. It creates a cooling, aquatic greenery effect, one reminiscent of a coastal shores. There is a nice, classic maritime feel to this fragrance. Whites and blues flash through my mind. On this particular day you may find yourself sailing, or captaining a ship, though the temps aren’t particularly high this morning, in fact, they seem slightly chilling in the wind. The vanilla and incense on the base are comforting, smoothing the rest of the fragrance out, though still not losing the mint and fresh woodiness entirely. I liked how I was able to create a story upon spraying this fragrance; those are my favorite kind. Longevity was fine and the projection was actually pretty good. **(7.2/10)**

*Egypt:* The lavender and moss in the opening were quite beautiful. It’s funny how two simple notes that can be found in hundreds of other fragrances suddenly become something special if composed well. The lemon follows after about a minute, adding some bitter citrus to the mix. The spices creep their way in, creating a warm and spicy aroma. Later, on the dry down, you are able to smell some leather. It remains spicy, though I was still thinking about the opening. In my opinion, it wasn’t very reminiscent of Egypt. It felt pretty standard, apart from the opening. Projection is not crazy, and the longevity is solid. **(4/10)**

**ZOOLOGIST**

*Rhinoceros:* The opening threw me off, it was very pungent. If I wore it out, I am sure it could be off putting for others, though after about ten minutes it becomes something *beautiful.* Before I get there, though, let me explain the opening in more detail. It was definitely boozy, but very dry and bitter. I actually enjoyed the uniqueness of not being a sweet booziness. I think the perfumer leaned into the bitter, dark side of coffee. The basil is a nice touch, and the leather was raw and rough. Okay, now for the exciting part. I must preface by stating: I still have difficulty identifying the nuanced notes in fragrances, so if what I’m explaining is incorrect, please let me know. Through the bitter, rough, dry, “hide” of *Rhinoceros*, there came this faint sweetness. It grew as the fragrance settled. I believe it was the ylang ylang, maybe the sweet grass, though I don’t have a solid understanding of that profile yet. The tobacco is a nice addition. Together, the composition is incredibly smooth. I enjoyed this experience immensely. The longevity was well over eight hours and the projection was good. **(8.7/10)**

*Musk Deer:* Considering Zoologist’s unabashed, continued creation of funky, boundary-pushing, realistic fragrances, *Musk Deer* is quite tame. I, like many, hold Zoologist in high regard for their ability to give us realistic takes on the concept of creatures roaming this planet, not swayed by the opinions of what’s, “nice”. Historically, musk deer glands have been used as an ingredient in perfumery, leading me to believe *Musk Deer* would be something very similar: animalic, musk-y, and not particularly crowd pleasing. That is not what I experienced. The opening was very nice; cardamom and calamus oil created a unique, green opening. Minutes later, rose creeps its way in, remaining quite prominent for a long period of time. The powdery note from the rose was off putting and, frankly, unwanted. Once the powder subsides, the sweetness of the rose is bearable, especially in unison with the newly found woods that have entered. The fragrance ends on a very well-blended, woody, sweet, sensual note. Still, not very “musk deer,” if you ask me, but a nice fragrance overall. Longevity is great and projection is mild. **(7.2/10)**",3,1736294988.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1hw69h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hw69h5/i_faked_breaking_my_hand_instead_of_quitting_a_job/,I faked breaking my hand instead of quitting a job,"So, when I was 19 I worked part time at a pizza place washing dishes, roughly 39 hours a week-- just enough that they didn't have to give me full time benefits. Because life is expensive and I still needed more money,I decided that I would try to find another additional job. I was hired at a local coffee shop working about 20 hours; also washing dishes. Fast forward a month and I'm working 7 days a week, exhausted, my feet never stopped hurting, and I hadn't had a day off since I started the second job. 

Now, I'm a very quiet, shy person and have sometimes quite severe anxiety issues. One day I was working at the coffee shop and I just broke. I stood there in front of the sink, cranky and exhausted and I just started crying. Crying that my feet hurt so bad, how tired I was, basically hating my life choices up to that point. I wanted to quit the coffee shop. I was too socially anxious and afraid to actually quit. It sounds stupid, but for those that suffer with anxiety, you may understand how petrified I was to go up to my boss and talk to her or tell her I quit. 

I then came up with this stupid idea. If I have a broken hand, I can no longer wash dishes and by default I wouldn't be able to do my job at the coffee shop anymore. When I got home, I started the dirty work. I hit things, slapped things, and dropped heavy objects onto my hand to try and actually break it. My hand ended up extremely bruised, hurt to move, and honestly looked like it was broken. 

I went to my pizza dishwashing job the next day, everyone in shock about my hand. I made up a story that I fell down the stairs holding a dish tub at my coffee shop job and landed on my hand wrong. I attempted doing my job normally, which actually proved to be difficult with my hand actually hurting. My boss came up to me halfway through my shift and said I should really get my hand checked out and said he was sending me home because I was struggling so much trying to wash dishes. 

My boss gave me the next three days off and to keep him posted. I did end up going to the doctor to see if it was actually broken. With the verdict of not broken, I still had an idea— the finishing touch. I looked up, found, and ordered a ""cast kit"" from Amazon (because, y'know apparently they have shit like that). The kit came two days later and I looked up how to wrap a hand, and went to town. Voila, I now had an actual cast on my hand, which actually was still quite bruised and hurting. 

I called my boss at the coffee shop job and informed them my hand was broken and what to do about it with the job since I couldn't work. She (my boss) gave me an indefinite leave of absence until I was better. I called my pizza job boss, said the same thing. We made arrangements that I would work out front instead if in back and would put me on the schedule. I never went back to the coffee shop job. I kept the cast on for two months, and coincidentally and luckily, my dad had one if those saws that could cut through my cast, yet couldn't cut skin. I borrowed his tool and cut the cast off myself. I've never told anyone what I really did and I honestly feel really bad and stupid about it. ",7,1736294982.0,confession,8,0.89,False

1hw67qb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hw67qb,Battery Powered Toothbrush,"I have been using a battery-powered toothbrush for over 10 years, and when finished brushing, I’ve always put it back on its charging stand. It recently occurred to me that since the device charges the batteries inductively, it must draw current constantly. Touching the charging post and feeling it to be slightly warm confirmed my suspicion. Now I felt it my duty to ascertain exactly how much all this electricity had cost me over the years.
I found our utility’s rate chart online and realized that my task would be more daunting than first imagined. They have two schedules: one for June - September and another for October - May. Embedded in each schedule is the rate for peak usage (3 PM - 7 PM) and a lesser rate for the remainder of the day. Of course, each of these rates from each schedule is different. Still, I was undeterred. I used my power meter to determine the exact power draw, which I discovered is the same whether the batteries are being charged or not. I won’t share the details of my computations, because I’m afraid they’ll be far too dull even for this group.
After double-checking my math, I concluded that constantly leaving the charging stand plugged in costs me 2.23 cents per month. Totally unacceptable! In my ongoing effort to not overpay for anything, I now plug the charger in every two weeks just long enough to top off the batteries. I won't live long enough to enjoy a nice dinner (or much of anything else) with my savings. I think I’ll take a nap now.

There were nine bodies spread around me, including a boy, a *lump* attached to me, curled into a ball. Our real identities were lost, though I could recall small things, tiny splinters still holding on. 

I saw a dark room filled with twinkling fairy lights, a bookshelf decorated with titles I never read, boxes of prescribed medication sticking from an overflowing trash can. The walls were covered in sticky notes and calendars, a chalkboard bearing a countdown to a date that had long since passed. 

*“I thought you were going to try this time? Why do you make it so hard?”*

The voice was a ghost in my head. She didn't have a name, barely an identity, but my heart knew her. She existed as a shadow right in the back of my mind, suppressed deep down. With her, I remembered the rain soaking my face, and my pounding footsteps through dirt.

When I tried to dive deeper inside these splinters, I hit a wall. 

It should have confused me, angered me, but I couldn't feel anger. 

There was only a sense of melancholy that I had lost someone close to me. 

With no proper memories, though, I didn't feel sad.

I wasn't the first one awake. There were others, but neither of us spoke, trapped inside our own minds. Drawing my knees to my chest, I wondered what the others were feeling and thinking. 

Did they have loved ones they couldn't fully remember? 

I did know one thing. There was something wrong with my body, the bones in my knees cracking when I moved them. Everything felt stiff and wrong, my neck giving a satisfying popping noise when I tipped my head left to right. The room was made of glass. 

Four glass walls casting four different versions of me. 

It was like looking into a fun mirror, each variant of me growing progressively more contorted, a monster blinking back. 

There was a metal thing wrapped around my wrist, and when I tugged it, the lump next to me groaned. I noticed the handcuff (and the lump) when I was half awake. But I thought I was hallucinating. The lump had breath that smelled of garlic coffee, and he snored.

*Adam*, my mind told me. 

The lump’s name was *Adam*. 

Everything about me felt…new. 

Like a blank slate. I had no real thoughts or memories. The boy attached to me was different from the others. 

Adam was dressed in the same bland clothes, but his had colour, a single streak of bright red stained his shirt. 

I found myself poking it, and he leaned back, his eyes widening. 

The red was dry, ingrained into the material. 

Which meant at some point, Adam had been bleeding. Not a lot, and he didn't look like he had any wounds. I studied him. Or, I guess, we studied each other. 

He was a wiry brunette with freckles and zero flaws, like his face had been airbrushed. 

This wasn't the *natural* kind of airbrush. I could see where someone or something had attempted to scrape away his freckles too, the skin of his left cheek a raw pinkish colour. I wasn't a stranger to this thing either. 

I could see where several spots on my face had been surgically removed. 

The boy glued to my side was an enigma in a room drowned of color. 

The red on him made him stand out in a sea of white, a mystery I immediately wanted to solve. 

I couldn't help it, prodding the guy’s face, running my finger down his cheek and stabbing my nail under his nose for signs of bleeding. I was curious, and curiosity didn't belong in the white room full of blank slates. I wondered if the old me looked for that kind of thing. 

Her bookshelf *was* full of horror and crime thriller, an entire box-set of a detective series my mind wasn't allowed to remember. There was that wall again, this time slamming down firmly on the room with the fairy lights. 

There was too much of *me* in my fragmented memory, the girl who wasn't Eve.

I wasn't fully aware that I was violently prodding Adam, until he wafted my hand away. The boy opened his mouth to speak, his eyes narrowing with irritation, before his mind reminded him that irritation did not exist in the white room. 

I watched the anger in his eyes fizzle out, and he frowned at me, adapting the expression of a baby deer. 

I think he was trying to be angry, trying to yell at me. When I realized he couldn't swear, or didn't know *how* to swear, he distanced himself from me, turning his back and folding his arms. 

I got the hint, shuffling away, only for the handcuffs to violently snap us back together.

“This is a recorded message stated by the United States Government on eight, twenty seven, two thousand and twenty three regarding The Adam And Eve Project. Please listen carefully. This message will not be repeated.” 

A text to speech voice drew my attention to the ceiling, and next to me, Adam let out a quiet hiss. 

“You have been unconscious for thirty five days and sixteen hours, following awakening. It is recommended that you remain where you are.” The voice was pre-recorded, but it definitely sounded aimed toward the Adam who was crawling towards a door that *looked* like a wall, but I could see the subtle glint of a handle. 

“Two hundred years ago, on April 5th 2023, NASA announced the discovery of DarkSky, a potentially hazardous NEO (Near Earth Object) was estimated to miss our planet, flying by at just 19,000 miles (32,000 kilometers).” 

*Two hundred years ago.*

The robot’s voice wasn't fully registering in my brain. 

The text to speech voice paused, and a screen lit up in front of us displaying DarkSky, and then flickering to several news screens. CBS, NBC, Fox News and BBC all with red banners and panicked looking presenters. “However. During its passing, the DarkSky asteroid’s collision course changed, striking our planet on April 13th, 2023, causing global destruction and a mass extinction event.”

A screen showed us the entirety of the West Coast underwater.

New York, London, Seoul, Tokyo, all of them. 

Either wiped from the map, or uninhabitable. 

“Wait.” I wasn't expecting Adam to speak, his voice more of a croak.

His eyes widened, like he was remembering who he was before Adam. 

“That's Apophis.” He scratched the back of his head. “2029.”

Adam’s random declaration of words and numbers intrigued me. 

I inclined my head, motioning for him to continue, but he just shot me a look.

Adam was a lot better at emotions than me. “What?”

“You… said something.” My own voice was a static whisper. 

He blinked, narrowing his eyes. “No, I didn't.”

Turning away from the boy, I decided to ignore him, and all of his future declarations. I should have been terrified, mourning the loss of not just my loved ones, but my entire planet. 

But I didn't have any memories of the world  except the rain, and a dark bedroom filled with fairy lights. I could have been a traveller, visiting every country and documenting each one. 

All of that had been taken away, and yet I couldn't feel sad or betrayed. 

Why would I mourn a planet I didn't remember? 

“Please listen carefully.” The voice continued. “You have been carefully selected in a choosing process for the Adam and Eve program. Humanity's last chance of survival. Two hundred years ago, you were cryogenically frozen in an attempt to restart in a new world."" 

I nodded, drinking the words in. 

""Presently for you, the earth is estimated to be habitable.” When the lights flickered off, the screen lit up, displaying exactly what the voice said. 

A new world, and the bluest sky stretching out across a never ending horizon. I found myself transfixed, smiling dazedly at brand new oceans and newly formed continents. 

“We ask this,” the message crackled. “On behalf of the President of the United States, will you do what we couldn't? Will you make the new world a better place? Will you fix the mistakes of your predecessors and restart our sick world?”

I heard my reply before I was aware of the word in my mouth. 

*Yes.*

The screen was brighter, that beautiful blue sky so hard to look away from. 

“Will *you* create humans you are proud of?”

*Yes.*

“Yes.” Adam’s murmur followed mine, the others echoing. 

“Will *you* be our future hope? Will you destroy every human being who goes against the new earth and spill blood in the name of Adam and Eve?”

*”Yes.”*

The room flooded with light, and I blinked rapidly, drool seeping down my chin. 

It was the voice's next words that tore away my mind. 

“It is with great displeasure, however, that we must inform you there are limited resources in our stockpile.” The ceiling opened up, a large ratty bag dropping onto the ground. It was a brand new color, but this time, a mouldy green. Something snapped in two inside my mind. It didn't belong in the new world. It was… poison from our predecessors. 

I backed away with the others, yanking Adam with me. At first, he didn't move, cross legged, a smile stretched across his lips. I don't think he noticed the bag. 

He was starry eyed, unblinking at the screen still filled with the new world. 

*Our* new world.

That was ours to mould into our own. 

“There is no need for panic,” the voice said. “Consider this bag an artefact of the lost world. There is nothing to fear.” 

Fear.

I wasn't sure I knew what that was. 

Did my old self feel *fear* running through the rain? 

Did I feel *fear* witnessing my planet burn right in front of me? 

“There can only be *one* Adam, and *One* Eve in the new world.” The voice continued. “Please choose among yourselves. You have two minutes.”

I didn't experience fear when the tranquillity in the white room dissolved. 

Adam violently pulled me to my feet when an Eve with a blonde bob dove inside the bag and pulled out a gun. She shouldn't have been able to use it. 

Our memories were gone, our old selves footprints in the sand. 

But it was the way her fingers expertly wrapped around the butt, that made me think otherwise. The Eve didn't hesitate, and with perfect aim, blew the heads off of two Adam’s, and then another Eve. I watched more colour splatter and pool and stain the white room, bodies falling like dominoes. 

When an Eve stepped toward me, my Adam pulled me across the room, dipped into the bag, his fingers wrapped around a machete. He threw me a gun, and another Adam dived for it. 

Still no fear. 

I ducked and grabbed it, my hands working for me, shooting the Adam between the eyes. I realized what we needed to do to survive. But it wasn't fear that made me kill. It was necessary for the new earth. The words were in my head, suffocating my thoughts. We had limited resources. There was no screaming, no crying, or begging. 

An Eve knocked me onto my face, but there was no pain. 

She kicked me in the head, plunging her knife into the back of my leg. 

Still no pain. 

Blood stained me, running down my chin. 

No pain. 

I didn't think, I just acted. One Adam and Eve left, and they were hardest to take down. The Eve circled me, eyes narrowed, calculating my every move. 

Adam and I communicated through nods and head gestures. Adam told me to go for the sandy haired Adam, while he would take a swipe at an Eve. 

I was taken off guard when the Adam surrendered, only to kick me onto my back, knocking Adam off balance too. 

I thought we were going to die. But my Adam had been following and predicting their every move. 

Back to back, I reached for my gun. Two bullets left. 

I managed to get Eve straight through her left eye.

I didn't notice we were the only ones left until the walls were stained red, my hands coated with Adam’s and Eve’s, and the final Adam was lying in a stemming pool of blood. I had pieces of skull stuck in my hair, and I was out of breath, but I felt a sense of triumph.

There was so much blood, but it was the blood of the *old* world. Both of us knew that. Adam turned to me, his eyes filled with stars, his skin stained red. 

I thought he was going to hug me, but his gaze found the screen where our new world awaited us. The two of us were breathless, awaiting the next instructions. But none came. I counted hours, and then a full day. 

Adam had gotten progressively less appealing the longer I stayed isolated with him. He sat against the wall with his knees to his chest, head of matted curls against the glass, the two of us suffocating in the stink from the slow decomposition around us. 

The other Adam’s and Eve’s were in their first stage. 

Bloating. 

How did I know that? 

“2029.” Adam kept muttering to himself, over and over again. 

It was the same number, repeatedly. 

I couldn't feel anger or irritable, but I was confused *why* he was saying it. 

Another day went by, and I was starting to feel deeply suppressed hunger start to bleed through. I watched Adam counting to himself, his eyes closed, feet tapping on the floor, and wondered if the new world would accept cannibalism. 

Adam stared at himself in the fun-mirror a lot, making noises with his mouth. I wasn't fully concentrating when he turned to me, blurting, “How big was Apophis again?”

To me, his words were alien, and I ignored him. 

But then he started talking again, spewing random words. 

“Huntley Diving Centre. Med school. Cheese sandwich. Man with a bald head.”

When I told him to stop, he continued. “Van. Cheese sandwich. Pretty Little Liars.” He knocked his head against the wall. “Professor Jacobs told me to go but I didn't want to go. I told him I'd call the cops, and then I'm seeing silver.”

“Adam.” I said. “Stop.”

“Bad news,” he whispered. “Very bad news I'm not allowed to tell anyone.”

“Adam.”

I think I was irritated. 

""You're talking too."" He grumbled. 

Was he feeling *anger*? 

I didn't realize I was angry, until my blood was boiling, my teeth gritted together. 

""Yes, because you keep singing and talking, and making mouth noises-- and you're driving me insane!"" 

His grin told me one thing. 

No matter what happened, and what toxic and tainted parts of humans we wanted to leave behind, we were those last remnants. 

""Don't look at me like that."" I snapped. 

He rolled his eyes. ""Like *what*?"" 

""Like that!"" I turned towards the wall, folding my arms. 

""Immature."" he muttered. 

""*I'm* the immature one?!"" 

Adam sighed. When I turned my head, his eyes flickered shut. “United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru,” his gaze tracked the screen in front of us. “Republic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too--"" 

I don't know what possessed me to whip around, lunging at him like an animal. 

I got close. So close, shuffling over to him, his breath tickled my chin. 

Adam's eyes were still closed, but he was smiling, and my stomach fluttered. I leaned forward, suddenly remembering that as Adam and Eve, we had a job to do. I think he knew that too, because the second I moved closer, he jolted away. 

""I'd rather reproduce with a plant."" Adam muttered. 

I was suddenly consumed with fear. I *had* to continue the human race. 

But did it have to be with *him*? 

*“We’ve found them!” an Adam’s voice, a *human* voice ripped me from strange, foggy-like thoughts. 

I shuffled back, swiping at my eyes. 

Was I... *crying*?

“Over here!”

Thundering footsteps followed and something in my gut twisted. 

I stood up, swaying. Adam followed, half lidded eyes barely finding mine. 

His expression was new. I think mine was too. 

Fear. 

*Humans.*

Before I knew what was happening, I was being grabbed by masked men, who were surprisingly gentle. 

Humans. I didn't know what to say. I asked them how they survived the asteroid impact, and they told me to stay calm. Adam was behind me, his arms pinned behind his back. 

He was being told to stay calm, but Adam *was* calm. He may have been nodding along to the human’s words, but he was thinking exactly what I was. 

When an Eve cupped my cheeks and asked if I was okay, my gaze flicked to my discarded gun. 

“Oliva!” She was yelling in my face. “Sweetie, you're in shock. Can you tell me how many fingers I’m holding up?”

I nodded dizzily, unable to tear my gaze from my weapon. “Five.”

**There could only be ONE Adam and ONE Eve.**

I felt fear for the first time when Adam and I were led through large silver doors and into blinding sunlight. When it faded and my eyes found clarity, I wasn't seeing breathtaking views of mountains and newly formed oceans. 

Across the road, a woman was walking her dog.

A school bus flew past, then an ambulance, a long line of traffic snaking down the road. I could smell Chinese food, my mouth watering.

When Adam started screaming, my fear came back, and it was enough to unravel me completely, sending me to my knees. I was still stained in blood, wrapped in a blanket I could barely feel. My mind that had been ripped apart, that had splintered for the good of our humanity, was starting to crumble. 

Humanity didn't *need* fucking saving. 

It only truly hit me when I was sitting in the back of a cop car, Adam in the front seat, his knees pressed to his chest, that I *wasn't* a last savior of our species. 

The earth was still spinning, still alive in modern day 2023, and I was just *Eve*. 

The Eve who sat next to me in the back of the car, gently rubbing my hands, told me my name was Olivia. 

I was a twenty four year old student, and I had been missing for three years. 

Adam’s name was *Kai.*

He was twenty three, and a med student. 

No, we were *Adam* and *Eve.* 

I spent a while in another white room, but this time I wasn't forced to kill people. 

I was told I had been through  brutal torture I could not remember. I told her that was impossible, and then she calmly showed me my legs and arms. 

I was covered in burns, old and new bruises, my body sliced open and stitched up. With this abuse, my kidnappers had successfully turned me into a shell of myself. I was asked if I wanted therapy to revisit those memories, but I declined. I was happy being Eve, even if it was just for a while. 

I saw Adam several times, but he was never fully conscious, either strapped to a bed, muttering to himself, or cross legged on the floor, head tipped back. 

I was two months into my treatment when he barged into my room, a hospital gown only just clinging onto his ass. 

""Eve."" He looked *drunk*, stumbling over to my bed. Adam grabbed my glass of water, drained half it, and spitting it out. 

""Or whatever your real name is."" He bit into my half-eaten stale cupcake. 

Again, Adam spat it out. ""This tastes like shit, Eve.""

""Olivia."" I said.

""Sounds fake.""

""That's one week old cupcake you're eating.""

He spat the rest out, and against all odds, I couldn't resist a smile.

""*You* look like shit."" He said, trying to lean against the wall. ""Love the hospital dress. He raised a brow. It's very *I just got out of the psych ward*.""

With his memories back, Adam was even more insufferable. 

I ignored that. ""Are you bleeding?"" 

I was referring to the smear of red dripping down his arm. 

Adam shrugged. ""It's a scratch."" He saluted me with cupcake wrapper. ""I ripped out my IV.""

I reached for my panic button, but he got there first. 

“2029.” Adam said, his words slurring. “Ihhhhs when Apophis is going to hit us.”

I nodded slowly. My re-education was going well. I was getting my emotions back in full. Which, of course, included annoyance. “It's going to *miss* us.”

“Think!” Adam hissed, pressing his finger to his lips. “Gotta be quiet! Shhhhh!” 

Shutting the door *painfully* slowly like he was in a cartoon skit, Adam stumbled over to my bed prodding at his neck. 

“They stabbed me,” he said in a manic giggle, “But I'm not stupid! I'm smart! I'm like sooo smart and it's been driving me crazy, but now I see it! This is why they took me away and played with my head! I was dumb at first! So, so dumb. But I remembered 2029. And it came back to me piece by *piece*, Eve.""

Adam leaned forward. “Apophis. 2029,” he said, his breath tickling my cheek. “Is why we were taken.”

He burst out laughing, and I stabbed the panic button. 

“Can't you see? April? 2029? 19,000 miles! A biiiiig lump of space rock going zooooooom!” he stopped laughing, slamming his fist into his palm. 

Impact. 

“BANG!""

Adam’s eyes widened, his expression crumpling. 

""That's what's going to happen! We lose all of them!"" He took a deep breath, and I braced myself. 

""Do *not* start singing.""

""United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru."" This time, it was with purpose, emphasising every country. 

""Adam."" 

He didn't reply, almost in spite. ""Republic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too.” The guy shook his head. ""Don't you remember the song they taught us? That's where it's going to hit!"" 

 ""Also from a cartoon."" I corrected. 

He surprised me by wrapping his arms around me in a hug. Adam was warm. 

His scent was a mixture of toffee and bleach. 

I tried *really* hard to tell myself the bandage wrapped around his head was a good thing. That he was getting better. 

""You don't know me, and I don't know you,"" he muffled into my shoulder. ""But neither of us can deny what we went though-- and what they want us *for*."" His grip tightened. ""They're trying to take away what I know-- and what I *know* is that that asteroid is not going to miss.""

""Eve."" he straightened up, and he looked so vulnerable. “Help me.” He whispered, before crumpling into a heap. I tried to help him, before my door swung open, several Eve's in white dragging him out.

According to them, he ‘was experiencing mild side effects from treatment.’

Unlike me, Adam chose to get his memories back.

Yeah, that's not a good idea. 

Olivia’s mind was too much, too painful. 

My old life started to seep back in the form of loved ones as I was slowly deconditioned. 

I stopped referring to boys and girls and Adam’s and Eve’s, and was firmly told “The New Earth” was just fantasy, all of the destruction I saw generated with AI. 

I have a girlfriend, who visited me every day. 

She said I didn't have to take the therapy, but I know she wants me to remember Olivia. Her name is Charlie, and when I was released from the white room, she took me back to our shared house. 

I have two roommates. Sam and Matt. Both of them kept their distance for a while, especially when I accidentally referred to them as Adam’s. I'm still getting letters from the facility politely “inviting” me for a therapy session.

I’m ignoring them, but I have started seeing a single black van outside our house. 

I think my kidnappers are back, and I'm terrified. 

The facility told me to call them AS SOON as I see anyone suspicious.

I've told Charlie and the guys to hide upstairs, and right now I'm in our living room. It's pitch black outside, but I can see a figure standing directly outside our house. I've turned off all the lights. 

Every time I blink, I swear they're getting closer. 

And I think... fuck. 

I think it's *Adam.*

His expression is blank, arms by his sides. Robotic.

I don't think he's *my* Adam.

How do I get over it?","Hey guys so a month ago I walked into this coffee shop my friend works at. I did this because the coffee shop was close to the library I was going to study at and I was a bit anxious and in a hurry to get started on my work. I had no intention of seeing my friend and was hoping to just go in and out of the coffee shop asap. This was because I was already slightly uncomfortable with her anyway, she takes subtle jags at me by jokingly calling me lame or stupid and I've been asking her if she wants to go to the beach with me, she says yes and goes with her other friends anyway. And I bet you're all like hey why do you continue to be friends with this girl. Well first of all we're not that close and I end up not texting her for months because I can tell she's avoiding me but then she starts up a conversation again to ask me how I'm doing and telling me we should hangout. So the mixed signals are a bit confusing and make me think that she does in fact consider me a friend? Also she has ADHD so I assumed that she just forgot that I asked her to go to the beach with me. Nonetheless, I was still pretty uncomfortable with seeing her so when it turned out she was working there I ended up talking super fast and wanting to get out of there asap. 

During our conversation she blurted out ""omg stop being so awkward"" to which I replied "" yeah im pretty awkward .\_\_\_\_."" which is kind of embarrassing but I was completely caught off guard by her saying that and froze on the spot so...  and the fact that her coworkers heard everything too made me feel super inferior and I wanted to get my coffee and get out of there. When I did get to the library I ended up crying in the bathroom for (not even joking) 2 hours :/ so I did in fact not study that day. I have really thin skin,  I feel broken for letting something like that affect me so much but I can't help it. It really sucks to realise how pretentious she is especially because she knows I struggle with socialising and also because she's this hippie girl who claims she's full of love and wants to heal and experience other people's consciousness.

I'm still so angry at her. She didn't text me afterwards. I keep telling myself to let it go and not be stuck in resentment towards someone who probably does not care about me at all. I think this situation plus starting a new job where I feel like I experience a lot of social rejection has made me start to turn to alcohol and partying in a destructive way. I keep blacking out every time I drink and waking up thinking I've embarassed everyone around me. Been super depressed after new years and I still feel really fragile and sad. I know its good for me to experience rejection because I need to learn to deal with it but I just don't know how right now. If you guys have any tips I would appreciate it.

","Hi everyone, so I started this job about two months ago and from the gecko it’s been a bit weird and quite a few different red flags have appeared. My boss is quite literally insane and suffers from some different attention deficit disorders and other mental illnesses. Which I am very aware is not his fault but he refuses to medicate, and is convinced that he’ll die if he does…I don’t know. I’ve had a lot of very strange experiences so far, but this past week recently has been completely bizarre and really concerning. For context, he was making us work in the office that was being renovated and was literally a construction site like walls being torn down, plaster dust flying everywhere, I insulation being replaced/removed. Just a complete safety hazard. I ended up having an asthma attack, that I haven’t had since I was seven years old. I’m in my mid 20s now. During my first (yes, there were two different occasions I experienced asthma attacks) he basically tried to convince me to go work from a coffee shop instead of going home to use my inhaler which pretty much saved your life during an asthma attack until I begged him to let me go home so I wouldn’t have to go to the emergency room. The second time after that, I was very much over it and it wasn’t as bad and I caught it before it got too bad so I ended up going to the second office where I let him know that that was not a safe work environment and I no longer felt comfortable working in that office and if that would continue, we would have to find our own arrangements. Everything went well for a while after that and I thought maybe it’s just a one time fluke or whatever. Anyway, fast forwarding to this week my coworker and I had realized that after we would talk, he would bring up conversations and little bits and pieces about what we had talked about that either the day before or the week before whatever. Well today, he asked my coworker while we were working from home if he was doing a good job as a manager, the night before as in last night, we had been texting on our own personal phones about how he wasn’t doing a good job as a manager. This is how we found out. He has access to our personal messages because he asked us to share our Apple ID with him so we could have access to the office locks. We of course trusted him before all of this and so we gave him our Apple IDs. We also found out that our office has recording devices hidden in vents. A previous employer had told us but neither of us believed him considering he was leaving in bad blood (now I see why lol)… under Kentucky Law is this okay??? Neither of us employees have signed an employee agreement or handbook or anything. This business is VERY VERY undeveloped in the facts that were the only two employees who should have a whole office full of roles. Mom and Pop kind of style place if you will. Also lied on the application and told me my job would be 80% marketing (my degree) and 20% sales, now I’m doing 90% sales and maybe 10% marketing. He’s a constant liar and manipulative to the core. I’m convinced his poor father, the owner of the company, doesn’t even realize his son is driving them into the ground. 

Anyway- any advice would be welcome. Should I take legal action? Can I even take legal action?? Or would I just be better off leaving and taking as little I can from this company with me. I don’t know, but I’m worried for anyone else that would be hired by them after I leave.

However, so many months down the line I felt open to meeting new people. I matched with a man (48) online. The first meeting was a coffee on a weekday which felt fine to me; keep it casual, informal, no pressure. What I didn't like was that I had to organise the location; he seemed unable to just pick somewhere saying he 'didn't really know anywhere' in the suburb we'd agreed to meet in, halfway between both of us. This in itself I found a bit unattractive; dude, you're almost 50, you're a corporate lawyer, surely you know how to use Google? After days of seeming inability to simply choose somewhere, I did the research and made a suggestion, we met there. The meeting was good, conversation flowed easily enough and he seemed very confident. He messaged me after to be clear he enjoyed the meeting, thought I was very attractive and intelligent and wanted to see me again, when was I free next week for... coffee. Again. I was a bit.. put off. A coffee, again, in the middle of the week? And yet again, he seemed completely unable to identify a suitable location. This time, I simply refused to make a suggestion, which meant a few hours before we agreed to meet, he still hadn't organised a place. There would be at least 1,000 cafes in the geographical circle we agreed to meet in, we're in an extremely populated city. He made a suggestion, an hour before the meeting, I agreed, then got a text from him 5 minutes before the time saying the place wasn't open, to meet somewhere else instead. Again, the meeting itself was relatively good and he came across as very confident. He then asked me for a third date - you guessed it - 'When are you free for coffee'. I am really put off now. Am I being unreasonable? It's almost like he doesn't want to have to pay for a date, like dinner, or a gallery, it's the only thing I can think of.

Help!,"I (31M) and partner (28F) - How Do I Reclaim My Relationship After My Girlfriend's 'Best Friend' Took Over or make this poly relationship ago with some rules?

My name is Alex. I’m 31 (Bi), and my wife Evie, who’s 28 (Bi), and I have been married for nearly four years, together for seven. We met on Bumble in 2017, and from the moment I met her, I knew she was someone special. Evie’s the kind of person who naturally draws people in, funny, sharp, and effortlessly cool. I fell for her hard and fast.

Early in our relationship, Evie confided in me that she’s bisexual. I was the first person she told, and I stood by her side when she came out to her parents. Thankfully, they were accepting, and it brought us even closer. Our relationship was built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect, and I always felt secure in the life we were building together.

Over the years, we would joke about her attraction to women. We would sit in coffee shops, pointing out women we thought were cute. Occasionally, the topic of a threesome would come up, but it was always light-hearted. We weren’t actively pursuing anything like that; it was more of a “what if” fantasy. I never felt like it was something we would actually explore.

But everything started to shift in mid-2023, when Keira, one of Evie’s new co-workers, entered our lives. Keira initially came across as friendly and confident, a typical new colleague. I didn’t think much of it when Evie started spending more time with her, grabbing drinks after work, texting more often, and occasionally inviting her over. Evie had been feeling a bit isolated since we moved in 2022, so I was glad to see her making a new friend.

When I first met Keira in person, I could tell she wasn’t just some casual friend. She was charismatic, with a natural charm that made people feel at ease. She identifies as queer (anything but straight). One evening, when we were all having drinks at home, the conversation turned playful, and we touched on the idea of a threesome. It was more of a joke at first, but there was an energy in the room that made it clear we weren’t just talking hypotheticals anymore.

A few days later, Keira approached me privately. She admitted that she had feelings for Evie but didn’t want to disrupt our marriage. She respected our boundaries and asked if it was okay to share those feelings with Evie. I appreciated her honesty. It felt like a rare kind of openness. After thinking it over, I gave her my blessing, under the condition that everything stayed above-board and Evie and I maintained open communication.

At first, things felt manageable. Evie was transparent about her feelings, and Keira made an effort to include me, making sure I never felt left out or sidelined. They started exploring their connection, which led to us having a threesome at one point. It was meant to be a shared experience, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Evie and Keira were more focused on each other than on me. Still, I tried to see it as part of our journey, something we were navigating together.

Over the next few months, Keira became a constant presence in our lives. She would come over for dinner, spend nights on our couch, and even join us for outings. By October 2024, her lease was ending, and Evie asked if she could move in temporarily. I hesitated at first, unsure of how this would affect our dynamic. But after several honest conversations, I agreed.

Once Keira moved in, our lives became more intertwined. The boundaries we had initially set became blurrier. Evie and I still had our moments together, whether it was date nights or quiet evenings spent talking about the future. But Keira was always there, an ever-present part of our household. It wasn’t long before her clothes started showing up in the laundry, her favourite snacks appeared in our pantry, and her toothbrush found a permanent spot in our bathroom.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t struggle with it at times. There were nights when I came home from work trips and found Evie and Keira curled up on the couch, or worse, sharing our bed. They assured me it wasn’t meant to push me out, and I tried my best to believe them. I knew Evie loved me, and I didn’t want my insecurities to cloud our relationship.

Things came to a head in December 2024, when we got news that should have been the happiest moment of our lives. Evie was pregnant. After months of trying, we were finally going to be parents. For a brief moment, it felt like everything would fall into place. Evie was radiant, her excitement infectious as we talked about baby names and started planning for the nursery.

But the joy was short-lived. One evening, Evie and Keira sat me down for a serious talk. Evie, with tears in her eyes, admitted that her feelings for Keira had deepened. She was in love with her, but she also insisted that her love for me hadn’t changed. She wanted to find a way for the three of us to coexist as a family. Keira stayed quiet, but her presence alone made the weight of the moment unbearable.

It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me. I was hurt, confused, and unsure of where I stood in all of this. But I could see how much Evie was struggling, torn between her love for me and her feelings for Keira. She begged me to understand, to give her time to figure things out. Despite my heartbreak, I told her I was willing to try, or her, for us, and for the baby.

We agreed to keep the lines of communication open and to set boundaries that worked for all of us. Over the next few months, we tried to navigate this new reality. Some days were easier than others. I could see how happy Evie was with Keira, but I couldn’t help feeling like a bystander in my own marriage.

By the time Keira fully integrated into our lives, it was clear that this wasn’t just a phase or a temporary arrangement. Evie’s love for Keira was real, and so was her commitment to me. We even revisited the idea of a threesome, not as a solution to our problems, but as a way to deepen the connection between all of us. It wasn’t perfect, but it helped us feel more united, even if only briefly.

We’ve had a lot of conversations about how this dynamic would work when it comes to parenting. Keira has expressed that she wants to take an active role in raising our child, not just as Evie’s girlfriend but as someone deeply invested in the family we’re building. She wants to contribute emotionally, financially, and practically—essentially co-parenting alongside us.  

It’s a lot to wrap my head around. I see how much Evie and Keira care for each other, and I can tell Keira is genuine about wanting to be a part of our child’s life. Will I still feel like an equal partner? Will we be able to maintain healthy boundaries while raising a child in such an unconventional setup?  

These are questions we’re still working through, but I want to give this a fair shot. At the end of the day, the most important thing is creating a stable, loving environment for our child. If we can figure out a way to make this work, with clear communication and mutual respect, maybe this can be a version of family that works for all of us.  

It’s not what I imagined when Evie and I started our journey together, but life rarely plays out the way you expect. I’m learning to embrace the unexpected and focus on what truly matters: love, support, and the commitment to making this family as strong as it can be.",2,1736293646.0,PolyFidelity,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hvebbz/comment/m5yj9ri/?context=3

First let me just address the common suggestion that Amanda's boyfriend is purposely sabotaging their childcare to trap her at home.  They make roughly the same amount of money and definitely can't afford to lose half their income.  I seriously doubt he wants her to stay home.

Second, I would never tell my stepson to find someone else to watch his child because of a simple difference of opinion.  My grandson and I have a very close bond. He's the oldest and it would break my heart and his if he didn't come spend his holidays and summers with me.  Plus he's a huge help with the little ones when I have them all and things get hectic. I would never be so petty as to make him (and all my other grandchildren) suffer because of an adult disagreement.

So I sort of asked around about why they were dropped by their new sitter so quickly.  Apparently they weren't. Amanda picked Cullen up and dropped him off both days he went and everything was lovely.  He did cry a quite a bit, but they expected that to get better as he adjusted to not being held as much.  

My husband and stepson talked to Amanda and she said that they realized that they can't afford daycare.  They already made the 'easy' changes (packing a lunch, giving up fancy coffee, etc) and his dad and her mom are both giving them about $100/month towards childcare and they can barely afford it, but they didn't realize that you have to send everything the baby needs.  

I buy diapers, wipes, formula, bottles, extra clothes etc.  They just hand me the baby.  They didn't realize that daycare didn't cover all that.  

Also, imagine her boyfriend's surprise when he found out what the staffing rates are in this very expensive daycare.  1 adult cares for 5 infants.  I guess he thought that someone would provide one-on-one care, diapers, wipes and formula for $350/week.  

My stepson relayed their almost apology. They felt overwhelmed by an infant and couldn't imagine that someone else could manage that plus other things.  

Cullen is going back to daycare tomorrow.  Cullen's dad is selling his dirt bike and Amanda is selling some designer clothes, handbags and shoes to cover the cost.  It'll get easier for them in 6 months when he transfers to the 1 year old class, which is a little cheaper.

I like to get lattes pretty often, and whenever I say I want a latte without specifying that I want it hot, baristas *always* ask if I want it hot or cold. I am annoyed by this and feel like I shouldn’t have to specify because coffee is brewed hot. Hot coffee is the default. Therefore, I think it makes sense that if you don’t specify, it should be assumed that you want it hot. 

And yes I understand that most likely, the reason baristas ask you to specify is probably because some people will not specify, and then the barista will make the wrong thing and the people who didn’t specify will get mad at them. So basically I’m annoyed that these people made it so that those of us who want the default hot coffee have to specify that lol. ",0,1736293003.0,PetPeeves,13,0.29,False

1hw5i7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1hw5i7o/im_maintaining_recovery/,I’m maintaining recovery,"Just for some backstory this bad breath issue started for me back in 2023. It was persistent for the second half of that year and calmed down beginning of 2024 until June through diet and exercise. I was finally cured by July 2024. I had stopped vaping, drinking coffee, eating as much sugar, and started taking probiotics. It came back this past October worse than ever because I fell off track (in overall life we’ll say). All I’m gonna say is that two weeks ago I started taking a HIGH dosage of probiotics each morning and I’m feeling pretty much recovered. 

I won’t shit on you guys… and what I will say is that yes, this issue sucks… But I can guarantee a good chunk aren’t doing everything you can to help it (I’m speaking for us adults). The only reason mine came back is because I wasn’t taking care of myself and I know that applies to a lot of you here. 

Stay disciplined and educated. Don’t sulk in misery. 

Most of us have gut issues, the probiotics helped me the most. 

I’ve been talking these (available on Amazon/ I found mine at Whole Foods)

The kind of place where cobblestones echo with stories and soft light spills from shuttered windows. There’s no set destination—just us, sharing thoughts, laughter, and half-serious dreams of what we’d do if this moment lasted forever. We stop at a little café, where the coffee is warm and the conversation is even warmer. The world feels infinite, but for now, it’s just the two of us—and that’s more than enough.*

I’m here searching for someone who dreams of moments like these. Could that be you?

# About Me

I’m a quiet soul with a curious mind—a writer, future vinyl collector, and lover of golden hours. My passions range from creating playlists that feel like soundtracks to discovering hidden hiking trails and catching fleeting beauty with my camera.

I thrive on deep conversations, small joys, and moments that linger in your memory long after they’ve passed. While I enjoy solo pursuits like gaming or reading, my greatest happiness comes from shared experiences and meaningful connections.

I’m looking to start with friendship—something genuine and unforced, like the first chapter of a great story. Maybe it evolves into something more, but for now, I’d love to connect and see where the pages lead us.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who is kind, thoughtful, and curious—a woman who dreams big, appreciates life’s quirks, and values honesty. You don’t need to have it all figured out (who does?), but you should have a desire to share your world while exploring a new one together.

Whether it’s collaborating on a project, swapping music recommendations, or planning spontaneous adventures, I’m looking for a partner who is ready to dream, build, and laugh along the way.

# What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things—the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love or how the world feels quieter under a blanket of stars. Loyalty is my foundation. I show up for the big moments and the small ones, believing that consistency and care are the cornerstones of a great connection.

I’m also a romantic in the best way: someone who leaves sweet notes, remembers your favorite things, and turns ordinary days into something a little magical.

If this resonates, let’s swap stories, playlists, or dreams. Whether it’s the start of a friendship or something more, let’s see where our chapter together takes us.",1,1736292888.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

And I feel like the crazy one.

For starters: we share a 2 bedroom apartment and I take the living room as my “bedroom”. I have asked many times for them to not wear their shoes inside, because the outside is filthy and I don’t want it tracked inside the living space. They still do, walk right through the living room and take off their shoes at their own doorsteps.

They leave their dishes out on my desk or the coffee table, or socks and clothes out wherever they please. I’m not a very confrontational person, so I’ve resorted to leaving their stuff in piles outside their doors and I know it annoys them.

The worst is the kitchen. I used to do their dishes for them thinking they left a couple out, and I guess they got used to it. Now there’s a constant mountain of dishes in the sink, crumbs all over the counter. I now refuse to use the kitchen just out of disgust, because I hate cleaning up other people’s messes. But the smell has started to drive me up the wall, we had ants infest at one point. 

And recently, a friend told me that in conversation with one of them, apparently they seem to think I have an “OCD problem” and need to get it checked out. I really wonder if I just have a higher standard of living than them? Or am I just the asshole here??? Even I’m not perfect, sometimes I leave my laundry out on a chair or am too lazy to sweep up my dog’s hairballs. But I recently heard one of them make a comment about picking something up before I “throw a fit.” I’ve never gotten mad at either of them directly, I have only ever sent pics to our group chat and politely asked them to clean up, or pics of a clean kitchen saying to try and keep it that way. They say they work too much and they’re too stressed out to clean right away.

This turned much more into a rant than a question. But I’m sorry, I had to get this off my chest somewhere. ",3,1736292670.0,badroommates,6,1.0,False

They stalled my feedback until the first week of January. They rejected me. 

My recruiter sent a personalized rejection email to me telling me all these good things about myself, even offering a follow-up feedback meeting. I was too heartbroken to even respond and I woke up today to a follow up message from him on a different platform once again emphasizing how much he enjoyed recruiting me and how he will always keep me in the back of his head for future roles.

So I want to know what your ways to make your coffee feel special on a budget. Is it a specific creamer or coffee? A morning ritual? 

For me, I was able to score an older but working Keurig machine on my local Buy Nothing group. I purchased bulk pods for a while (about $0.50 per cup of coffee, not terrible) and they were ok, did the trick. But I felt bad about using disposable pods so I asked my friend to gift me a couple of reusable k-cup filters for the holidays and OH MY GOODNESS. The amount of coffee they use per cup is so little and the coffee is so much better! I'm a 2 cup per day drinker and I can now make a regular 12 oz package of coffee last 75% longer than I could when I was doing a pour over or a small drip coffee maker. Even if I purchased a Keurig new, with the coffee savings, it would probably pay for itself over two months.

WILLIAM GE had a solid performance. Another competitor who played an unusual piece for these competitions: Waltz in A-flat major, Op. 69 No. 1. I liked his left hand and the mesmerizing details of his touch. If I had to define his playing, I would describe it as confident and studied. Not many risks, and you can expect an excellent performance under his hands.

Regarding PAUL JI... I disagree with his classification because his ballade in the preliminaries was dirty, and the scales weren't clear enough. Nevertheless, his preludes were incredible. I couldn't stop listening to his inner voices. His ""Andante spianato and Grand Polonaise brillante"" was powerful. Definitely deserves the next stage!

I had a cup of coffee while listening to the interview during the break; it was interesting.

Later, TIMOTHY JONES. He had a brilliant performance, but his slips on Preludes Op. 28 Nos. 5, 8, and 12 could disqualify him. His energetic playing transported me to another world. A great Scherzo Op. 39, the highlight of his performance.

ANTONI KLECZEK closed the recital masterfully. I was working, and when the Fourth Ballade was beginning, my work took a backseat. What delicacy, what a gentle touch! I clapped alone in my bedroom. My eyes filled with tears, as few performances have ever done. Thanks, ANTONI.

I worked for years working on Film sets, as coffee mechanic, dish washer, uber driver, pet store clerk…years of being burnt, bruised, concussed, cut, diseased and stolen from. I was never making more than 85 cents for ever $1.00 I needed to live. Miserable. 

I finally was able to break through and secure a job selling insurance, I loved the work but I moved onto a job in tech. I finally begged my way into not one, but two tech companies working at the very bottom fielding calls with angry customers, navigating impossibly complicated glitches in the software and some morale hazards of what our software was designed to do. 

After years of demoralizing, soul crushing, injury inducing jobs, my day finally came!

Christmas of last year my mother died of liver and kidney failure and left each of her four children about $2.5 million. Completely untaxed. We didn’t grow up rich so this was a huge shock to us all. 

In my life, my hard work never ever, not once ever paid me enough to live on. Not only that, the rate I was saving in 401k and IRAs would need me to save money for over 700 years to achieve the same amount. 
MY MONEY MAKES THREE TIMES AS MUCH IN INTEREST AS EVEN MY HIGHEST PAYING JOB IN MY LIFE. 

I feel extremely fortunate and have taken some time to myself to relax, but the more I think about this the more I feel insulted for my fellow human beings who only ever work hard and get nothing for it. I live in a neighborhood of struggling workers who work harder than I ever did, their government and their community has just decided that whatever you do for work is never going to be enough.

1hw51ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1hw51ot/de_spoilers_anyone_else_really_annoyed_by_how/,"[DE] [Spoilers] Anyone else really annoyed by how unnatural and stupid a lot of the characters' actions are, like how Max is laughably indiscreet in her ""snooping""?","Just finished the game. I see people criticizing the overarching plot for how contrived and nonsensical it is (such as the whole Lucas plagiarism thing), and I can agree. But something that broke my immersion a lot *during* the playthrough is how a lot of the screenwriting feels awkward and illogical. The characters actions are nonsensical and overly reckless. I was screaming in my head about this so much and it was quite annoying.

Max is the primary offender. She is **SO INDISCREET** in her snooping and actions. Strolling around an abandoned bowling alley with no one around is one thing. But bruh, why are you:

* Picking a library's lock in plain sight when other students are there?

* Messing with Olga the projector when Reggie was *right there* and could've turned his head at any moment?

* Vandalizing the Lucas standee, and opening his suitcase, both in the middle of the cafeteria when he was just a few feet away and also could've noticed you at any moment?

* And for fuck's sake, **POCKET THE GODDAMN PHOTO BEFORE ALDERMAN SEES IT**. Just lean on it with your forearms or put your coffee cup on it or whatever; he turned his head away multiple times during that scene where he visits Max's house.

Beyond just Max being the worst snooper, the stiltedness shows in other ways. Why did Max have to listen to Moses using the pulse power to figure out how to mess with Olga? Why couldn't she just write the instructions down on paper?

And probably the worst offender for me: **YOU FUCKING DUMBASS LUCAS, WHY ARE YOU LEAVING A GUN IN YOUR UNATTENDED COAT**. That is just *asking* for trouble, like leave it in your car or office. It's especially illogical given how Safi was apparently able to conceal the gun on her person when she wasn't wearing a coat; so why couldn't Lucas do the same? (And I just realized: how would Safi have kept the gun on her person concealed since she didn't have a holster?)

Really, the highly stilted moment-to-moment screenwriting and the characters contrived actions are quite an issue with the game. It's not solely the overarching story and its plot holes.",3,1736291675.0,lifeisstrange,2,0.72,False

This is acceptable, IF NOT consider the fact that I just showed the same lady at the counter my order number on the app to get my coffee but was told my wrap isn't ready yet FIVE mins ago so I had to ask again later. That's when that lady for some reason started treating me as if I were a total different person, and even I did the above due to I'm rush on time and don't want to argue with her, she still refuses to just turn around and check the paper bags in the basket. She simply said ""It's not ready yet, if ready I'll know, go wait in line"". Until I had to told her again and again it's not coffee it's the wrap in the paper bag just check and you will find my order, she then reluctantly check the paper bags one by one and goes ""I TOLD YOU IT'S NOT REA--oh wait, here it is.""(I swear she really said this) And finally tossed me the bag and back to asking others their order number. 

I know all this sounds like I'm a super petty person, buy GOSH that 30 mins felt offensive. I don't want to go to that Tim Hortons at campus ever again. ",12,1736291599.0,UTSC,7,0.93,False

A buddy of mine was paying rent on 2 units on a building that has about 5 or 6 storefronts.  It's a new renovated building, in a high end neighborhood. Big parking lot in the back.  In one unit he runs a brazilian jiu jitsu academy and it's his 3rd one so he has the process down and just that revenue ""covers"" the rent for the 2nd space next door (They share a wall).   What would you put in there?  We don't want to put the cliche things like ice bath, recovery room, or sport related stuff.  There is a traditional gym close by, a Crossfit gym down the street, and spa/cold plunge/cryo also down the street.

I know it's a very vague question without knowing demographic, location, etc. We were thinking a coffee shop. Another friend of ours successfully started 2 in 2 different towns.  He has it down to a science.  Packed out all the time. Open late.  It's got the living room/couch vibe.  Pastries, Gelato, live music some nights, dim cozy lighting.

But all I hear is that coffee shops are nightmares and really don't make much money.

1hw4z8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1hw4z8c/pmdd_relationship_rules/,PMDD Relationship Rules,"Hello everyone! I posted a response to a comment mentioning the relationship rules my husband and I have and someone asked me to share the full rules, so here goes! Keep in mind that this is just what works for us; feel free to use whatever rules work for your situation. Also, please excuse my use of pronouns and feel free to change them to suit you and your partner's preferences. 



**PMDD Relationship Rules:**

1. If one person wants to talk, both parties MUST sit down facing each other and talk until both parties feel comfortable ending the conversation. 
2. No swearing at the other person. Example: “You’re so fucking mean” - not allowed. “I’m so fucking tired” - allowed.
3. Inside voices only. No shouting our getting too loud. Both parties are allowed to gently remind the other to lower their volume. 
4. Listen first and try not to interrupt. Some interjecting is allowed but must remain brief and limited. 
5. PMDD person is allowed to ask for a 10-minute break if she is feeling overwhelmed, angry, or emotional to compose and reflect before re-joining the conversation. PMDD is not allowed to interrupt her partner to request this, needs to be requested after the other person has finished their thoughts. Breaks must be allowed if requested. PMDD must not over-use breaks as a way to avoid conversation, and breaks must be limited to 10 mins. 
6. Absolutely no getting physical. This includes the obvious of throwing things, hitting, and/or breaking objects. 
7. No distractions. Fidgeting and fidget toys are okay, but no phones, internet surfing, or distractions while the other person is speaking. This is especially hard for individuals with ADHD and avoidant coping mechanisms. 
8. No running away. Ask for your 10-minute break if you need a few minutes away from the conversation. Also, no slamming doors. 
9. No crocodile tears. Crying is okay, but no ugly crying for emotional manipulation. Focus on the goal of mutual understanding. 

These rules apply to both the individual with PMDD and the partner. Below are additional recommendations that I find helpful as a PMDD sufferer. 



**Relationship Recommendations:**

1. Re-state your understanding of your partner’s thoughts immediately before responding with your own rebuttal. This helps to ease tension and conflict and promote mutual understanding.
2. Ask lots of questions to clarify the other person’s perspective and intent. I find myself making lots of negative assumptions during luteal and have successfully avoided conflict by asking his intentions first. 
3. State your emotions clearly when responding to your partner. Can also use the format of “when you do/say \_\_\_\_, it makes me feel \_\_\_\_.”
4. Try to be self-aware and vocalize your observations. Example: “I’m feeling really afraid of you right now. I realize I’m in luteal and might not be responding the most rationally, but I want to feel safe with you.”
5. Lead every conversation or disagreement with the goal of mutual understanding. Be okay with agreeing to disagree on some things and be open to compromise on others. For things that are non-negotiable, I found it best to discuss those triggers in follicular, NOT luteal. 
6. Plan ahead during follicular. Do the hard work of setting the ground rules and communicating your boundaries when you’re feeling your best. 
7. Learn your partner's emotional triggers during disagreements. Avoid triggering your partner if possible. 

There is a LOT of nuance to these rules, which can further complicate things. We built these rules up over time and try to follow them the best we can, but like everyone, we're human and don't always interact perfectly. Talking things through is HARD WORK. It's not going to be easy and it may take time to get used to the new flow of conversation during disagreements. Using these rules, my husband and I have managed to go 6 months without a major fight. Now we only occasionally have a major fight, usually when I don't follow my other rules for PMDD like no coffee, no alcohol, etc. ",23,1736291489.0,PMDD,9,0.97,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1hw4q68,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1hw4q68/employee_resigned_then_wanting_to_come_back_after/,"Employee resigned, then wanting to come back after a replacement was hired","Hello Managers, I have a tricky situation with a previous employee, and have received mixed feedback on how to proceed.

As a background, I had a great previous employee, middle-manager level, in my team, she was pretty senior in the company (she had been there more than I am), and has always done excellent work, a great employee altogether. She resigned not for compensation issues or anything that had to do with the team, but because she wanted to pursue a completely different position in a different department that was not available at our company. 
The replacement just started a couple weeks ago, he’s really good but still training and transitioning into the team.

Apparently the company where previous employee was hired went through a hiring freeze so her offer was rescinded / the position was eliminated basically as soon as she started. I have heard through team members that she was inquiring about her old position in the company. Obviously, while I would love to have her back, a replacement was already hired to fill her position. She hasn’t formally spoken to me about her position but she has asked for a coffee chat (which is not weird in our company, we keep in touch with people who are no longer with us pretty often). 

Now, I don’t want to get too ahead of myself, however I believe she might ask to have her job back because of this. The team obviously would love to have her back as well. I spoke to my boss (President) and her opinion is to just let go of the replacement, take her back, save resources on training, we know her work is excellent. 

This however doesn’t sit right with me, firstly the new hire is doing great so far, he has less experience but I don’t think he will be underperforming in the position at all. Also, he had a job and resigned for this position, so it would put him in the predicament my previous employee is in right now. Moreover, while I don’t think it’s fair to classify her as a “flight risk”, because she did leave because she wants to work in a different sphere, I think even if I considered hiring her back, she would potentially resign as soon as another opportunity comes up, which is absolutely fair, but if that happens in a few months, that would mean going through the recruitment process all over again.

I’m overall mostly concerned about the dynamics of the team towards the new replacement, since everyone is friends and they obviously really like the previous employee, and maybe slightly concerned about him not working out in the end and getting a “told you so” from my boss.

Am I justified in my position to not consider hiring her again? Is there something I didn’t consider? 

-----
Update: thank you everyone for their advice and perspective on this. I wasn't looking for a right or wrong answer, just different perspectives and considerations. I appreciate everyone's comments, I'm comfortable in my position moving forward.

**Prologue**

**ANGEL GROVE, 2001**

Tommy Oliver stood with his arms crossed, frustration evident in his furrowed brows. He watched his best friend, Jason Lee Scott, pack up his belongings, clearly uncomfortable with the situation.

""I don’t get it, Jase. You don’t have to leave just because there’s a new villain in town,"" Tommy said, his voice tinged with concern.

Jason stopped and turned to face Tommy, a determined look in his eyes. ""Tommy, I have to do this. I can’t let anyone find him. If someone discovers his lineage, he’ll become a target, and I can’t allow that to happen.""

""I understand that, but—""

""Tommy, I was the original Red Ranger. I know the dangers. After what the Rangers from the future told us about my son, I will do everything in my power to prevent that future,"" Jason said, his voice rising with emotion.

Tommy sighed, letting his arms fall to his sides. He glanced over at a young boy playing with a video game nearby, oblivious to the serious conversation. The boy wore a black t-shirt with a Red T-Rex and green pants with a Saber Tooth emblem. At least, Tommy thought, the kid wasn’t paying attention to his father’s heated words.

""Look, the future can change,"" Tommy said, turning back to Jason. ""Jen told us about it for a reason. By warning us, she might have already altered the course of events.""

""Zordon always believed we were destined to get our powers, including you,"" Jason replied. ""Jen said the same. If my son is destined to become a Ranger, I want him to have a normal childhood first.""

""And you think leaving is the answer? Where are you even going?"" Tommy asked.

""Harwood County. My investor has been pushing me to open a new martial arts school there. It’s a good opportunity, and it means I don’t have to separate Jacob from his mother too much,"" Jason explained.

Tommy nodded, placing a supportive hand on Jason’s shoulder. Losing Jacob’s mother had been tough on everyone, especially Jason and Kimberly. They had pulled through, largely thanks to Jacob’s resilience. The boy had his mother’s gentle nature and his father’s fierce determination.

""Jase, if this is what you need to do for Jacob, then I support you. But promise me you'll visit from time to time and let us know when you move into your new place. We all care about him, and if he ever becomes a Ranger, we’ll be here to guide him,"" Tommy said.

""You think we can really prepare him?"" Jason asked, his voice wavering with emotion.

""Absolutely. He'll never be alone, Ranger or not. Look at all the gifts he has from other generations. Andros and Karone’s DECA replica, the necklace from Mirinoi, and Carter and Dana’s mini-lightspeed rescue badge. They all care about him,"" Tommy reassured.

""Yeah... Jen even left a way to communicate with her if things get complicated,"" Jason admitted.

""See? We’re all here for him. Changing your name to stay under the radar won’t change that,"" Tommy said firmly.

Jason nodded, hugging Tommy tightly, trying to hold back his tears. No matter what the future held, they were a family. And the family always stood together, no matter what.

**REEFSIDE, 2007**

Tommy greeted his godson, Jacob, with a warm hug and led him inside. Jacob, now ten but tall for his age, had been waiting for this visit for a long time. It wasn’t until Mesogog was defeated that Jason had allowed Jacob to visit Reefside for the summer.

""Conner! Let me introduce you to Jacob Thomas Scott Kwan, son of Jason Lee Scott and Trini Kwan, the original Red and Yellow Rangers,"" Tommy announced proudly. ""And my godson. Jacob, this is Conner McKnight, the Red Dino Ranger.""

""Wow! Like my dad!? That’s amazing!"" Jacob exclaimed, his eyes wide with admiration.

""Awesome is the word you’re looking for,"" Conner said with a grin. ""It’s an honor to meet you.""

Conner looked Jacob up and down, sizing him up. Tommy noticed the familiar look in Conner’s eyes—he was already thinking about Jacob’s potential.

""Why are you looking at me like that?"" Jacob asked, puzzled.

""You could be good at soccer. How old are you again?"" Conner inquired.

""I turned ten last month,"" Jacob replied, still confused. ""What’s soccer?""

Conner’s jaw dropped while Tommy chuckled. Jacob’s upbringing had been so focused on training and study that he had missed out on many normal childhood experiences.

""Soccer is a sport, Jacob,"" Tommy explained. ""This is why I asked your father to let you stay here this summer. You need to learn how to have a normal life before high school.""

Jacob nodded, though Conner still looked stunned when the rest of the Dino-Rangers—Ethan James, Kira Ford, Trent Fernandez-Mercer, and Hayley—walked in.

""Oh look, your boyfriend is broken,"" Trent teased Kira, pointing at Conner.

""What happened?"" Kira asked, approaching Conner. ""Hey, jock boy, wake up.""

""Did he see another front-page magazine with you in it, Kira?"" Ethan joked.

Kira tried to snap Conner out of his daze while Jacob, worried, gently grabbed Conner’s arm. Kira smiled at the boy.

""You must be Jacob, right?""

""Yes, and he broke Conner because Jacob doesn’t know about soccer,"" Tommy explained, amused.

""For real!? Even I know the basics of soccer,"" Ethan said, laughing.

""No wonder he’s broken,"" Trent said. ""You probably broke his heart too, poor McKnight.""

""Stop teasing Conner,"" Kira said, amused. ""Babe, come on, wake up. Jacob, don’t worry about them. Conner will be fine.""

""And he’ll want to teach you all about soccer when he wakes up,"" Hayley added, handing Tommy a coffee.

Conner finally snapped out of it, kissed Kira, and turned to Jacob with a smile.

""I have a soccer ball that’s special to me, but if you want, I can share it with you and teach you a few tricks. I believe you have potential,"" Conner said.

Jacob nodded, determined to learn this new sport. He had his father’s spirit animal, so it couldn’t be that bad, right?

""Basics first, coach,"" Kira said with a smile.

""Of course, babe. I’ll make sure he loves this sport by the end of the day,"" Conner replied.

Jacob looked at Tommy for confirmation. Tommy nodded, knowing his Dino team would have a positive influence on Jacob and help him open up to the world.

""Kick his ass, kid!"" Trent encouraged.

""And don’t call me babe, McKnight!"" Kira shouted.

Tommy chuckled. Jacob was going to love them.

**HARWOOD COUNTY, 2012**

""Jake!""

Now 15, Jake turned to see his mentor Mike approaching him with Emily. He smiled brightly. It was summer, and with his best friend Noah away, he had been feeling bored. Seeing Mike and Emily was a pleasant surprise, signaling that the Samurai Rangers had won their battle.

Jake ran to them, nearly knocking them over with enthusiasm. They hugged him back with equal excitement.

""It's over? For real?"" Jake asked.

""For real,"" Mike confirmed. ""We won, and we can have our lives back. Kevin is training for the Olympics, Antonio is taking it easy, and Mia got into a cooking school.""

""Oh, thank God,"" Jake sighed in relief.

""Yeah,"" Mike laughed. ""Lauren is enjoying her free time, and Jayden is staying with Mentor Ji at the Shiba house.""

""I see... what about you two?"" Jake asked, noticing their joined hands. He laughed when Mike looked away and Emily blushed. He was thrilled that Mike had found someone to ground him, and there was no one better than Emily.

""Oh... so congratulations are in order?"" Jake asked.

""Yeah, thank you, buddy,"" Mike said. ""We're heading to Emily’s place. Hopefully, I’ll make it back.""

""My dad won’t hurt you,"" Emily chuckled. ""My sister, on the other hand, might be a different story.""

Mike looked momentarily worried but relaxed when Emily kissed his cheek. Then he turned to Jake, pulling something from his pocket and placing it in the young boy's hands.

""A Samuraizer?"" Jake asked, surprised.

""Antonio adapted it for you,"" Mike said seriously. ""The whole team agreed you should have one. If you're ever in trouble, don't hesitate to use it. We'll be by your side in seconds.""

Jake looked at the Samuraizer, then back at Mike and Emily, and nodded solemnly. He knew enough about Jen’s warnings to understand the gravity of the situation. He also knew he wouldn’t fight alone.

Taking a deep breath, Jake hoped his future team would be as strong as the previous ones. If they were chosen, they had to be.

""It also allows us to stay in touch,"" Emily said, hugging Jake. ""No matter what, we are family, and we will always be there for you.""

Jake nodded, hugging the Yellow Ranger. He did the same with Mike and watched as they left for the train station. Holding the Samuraizer, Jake thought about his legacy.

Safe to say we’re very open and playful with each other, constantly making sex jokes.

Yesterday we had work staff party with a free bar, we were finishing work at it started to she ordered to let me come back to her hotel for a shower since I lived too far away.

We went back, she was totally relaxed getting changed in front of me and we went to the party.

She got absolutely hammered and eventually started getting hands on with my, literally grabbing my throat to kiss me.

I could obviously see she was in a bad state so I didn’t act on it but I wanted to reciprocate.

Night ended by me taking her passed out back to the place she was staying and then leaving for the bus home.

Next morning she calls me asking where I was and I asked if she wanted to meet to talk about it.

Meet for a coffee, end up staying there hours, she invites me back her place and we smoke a bit.

Sat and talked for hours again but when I bring up what happened and tell her how I feel she essentially said “I want to be with you but I’m not ready for a relationship”

Things got awkward and I left.

https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/s/v0ZHcEYiDg

But most said she was flirting. I'd say she was trying to belittle me. 

It's Tuesday, and I still feel still quite embarrassed. Even though I told her I had anxiety, and that not everyone is built the same way.

She said I should practice. She expressed through her body language that i should sound more assertive.

I seen her again today, she smiled and said hi, I proceeded to wave.

(I usually don't verbally say hi to people unless I know them) 

I got my usual coffee (she made strong eye contact, to a point where it made me fumbled over my words, guess it got me nervous), she asked me how my day was, and I told her it was OK, I asked about hers she gives a bit more of a descriptive response.

Which I replied cool, ok, or dang. Lol 😆 

I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, but just trying to figure out how to best redeem myself after a woman disrespected my manhood.

It just feels that I have prove myself that what she said is bullshit. I feel deeply rejected, and despite having a clean diet, consistent gym routine, her words broke me. 

Maybe, it hurts more cause I recently got out of a relationship.

1hw4npj,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1hw4npj/will_this_write_up_screw_my_promotion_over/,Will this write up screw my promotion over?,"Hey all - been a barista for just over a year. I lost my last corporate job over 2 years ago, was on unemployment, had a contract job with my old company and have another part time job, applied to thousands of jobs, been through two or more rounds with dozens of companies, and started a coding boot camp that turned out to be a disaster, all before I took a barista job last year to help make ends meet.

I expected it to just be something I did until I got another desk job, but over the last year (and I promise I’m really not a corporate dickrider when I say this), it’s really changed my life. My crew is awesome here, nearly all of us are friends and have deep connections to each other. I used my health insurance to pursue a depression treatment that very likely saved my life. I’ve become a barista trainer and have trained 4 people, and am three seasonal blends away from becoming a coffee master. Being on my feet and talking to people, rather than working remotely, has led me to consider a big career change to becoming a nurse. While I go back to school for that, I want to be able to stay on and have been on the track since the summer to become a shift supervisor. My current store manager is leaving to open a new store, and our manager trainee who’s likely taking our store over and our DM had set up a timeline before Christmas that would have me in the shift role by mid to late February.

Here’s where I have trouble - I had a write up in May that fell off in November; my phone died the night before a morning shift and didn’t turn back on when I plugged it in to charge, so I slept in a few hours from when I was due to go in. Before then, I’d had a write up for tardiness in early March, but in between March and May, and May until recently, nothing has happened.

A few weeks ago, I got in under 5 minutes late and my shift had said to “write the real time in the book or else I can’t cover you to HR,” which seemed strange since he’s been guilty of writing the original start time in the book when he’s come in late too. All of us have. So, I originally wrote the late time in the book and talked to my manager trainee, who said as long as no one said anything, he’d take care of it. So, I went back and wrote it to be a 0.

One girl on that shift, who’s had an axe to grind with me for months for reasons I still don’t fully know, took a photo of the book and reported me to HR. She’s a more tenured barista and used to be super revered and liked, but has turned into a relentlessly miserable person and has drained any potential empathy people on the team would have for her away from them. She constantly complains about missing the old crew, and we’ve tried to invite her to do things with us, but she never wants to be involved. She calls off all the time, usually after shifts start, and also had a scheduling mixup with someone where neither of them ended up coming in and my shift friend and I had to two man an open.

My manager trainee said it was going in as a write up and will very likely delay my shift movement until July. I found this out on NYE, spent 20 hours in bed before working a double because I was too panicked and anxious to want to be awake. I cancelled a party I was gonna have with my work friends and they were scared of how dark of a place I was in.

My manager trainee said he still believes in me and if he gets our DM’s blessing to look past this, we’ll move forward with my shift training. She’s fairly by the book, but has also been a barista, knows my work ethic, and has said she fully endorses the idea of me being a shift. I’ve talked to the union and have some ideas on how to challenge this, and I’ve seen on here people have said they’ve moved up with write ups on their record.

So tell me, Reddit - is my promotion doomed? I really need it to go through so I can be more stable and less reliant on familial help. And also I really love my store and (almost) all of my team there and don’t want to leave them.

1hw4joz,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hw4joz/is_this_malpractice/,Is this Malpractice? ,"I, 45m, recently lost my wife, 35. Obviously, this is a crushing, devastating and horrible event that honestly, I still am not handling well. I've come here to see if there is something legally wrong with how she was treated. 

First, let me say that around Thanksgiving, my wife started not feeling well. Nothing alarming, overall, but she had some coughing, weakness and a bit of a lack of an appetite and an upset stomach. We figured it was just a bug or something along those lines. After a few days of not getting any better, we started to become a bit concerned. She was experiencing what she called brain fog and wanting to sleep every couple of hours butgthe started having labored breathing.

I am in a wheelchair and unable to drive so we decided to call 911. The paramedics showed up and took her in to the hospital. While at the hospital, they put her in the waiting room where she continued to have trouble breathing and at one point, as she was going outside to cool off, she tripped over a wheelchair that was in the waiting room. After about an hour, they took her back and started to examine her. The doctor said, ""Oh, I can smell the infection on your breath. You have Strep throat."" With that, the examination stopped and they administered an antibiotic shot and discharged her with prescriptions for antibiotics and ibuprofen.

Over the next 2 days, she was taking the meds as prescribed but she was still getting worse. As the night came, she had suddenly forgot how to open a door and she kept saying I was 36 years old. I called 911 again. This was too scary. So the paramedics show up again. Check her vitals and then say, ""You're fine. All you need is rest. If you're still worried in the morning, go to an urgent care"" and with that, she came back inside yet struggled to breathe and sleep throughout the night.

The next day, it was more of the same but now she had forgotten how to make a pot of coffee and later, how to dress herself. So instead of having an uber take her to an urgent care with her brain acting this way, we call 911 again. Again they came out and again checked her vitals and yes, again, say all she needs is rest and to go back inside. So she does. The rest of the day and in to next, we are scared. She is telling me that she doesn't want to die but then puts faith in what the ER and subsequent interactions with the paramedics have told her, That she's fine.

Come the nighttime, she has now forgotten how to open and close water bottles properly, she's not eating, nor is she urinating. I start to call 911 and she collapses. I help her up the best I can, and she collapses again. I get back on with 911 and get the paramedics back who this time show up with a supervisor and immediately, she is put on a gurney and taken to the ER. 

over the next 3 hours at the ER, her hands and feet turned purple and she was intubated, as they said, to control her breathing. 24 hours later she was put in the ICU. Her organs were shutting down and They found she had Sepsis but could not tell why. After I told them that she had a problem with a tooth in mid-november, they checked the heart and found endocarditis and her Aortic valve was deteriorating. 

They attempted dialysis to get her kidneys working while administering antibiotics. Their goal was to stabilize her blood pressure so they could replace her valve. They were never able to raise it enough. 6 days later, while in a coma, they performed an MRI which showed a countless number of strokes had occurred while she had been intubated. She died in the early morning hours the next day. 

Are the ER and/or the Paramedics at fault here? Her organs were still working up until the last day. ",5,1736290370.0,legaladvice,5,0.86,False

long story short, I might have Crohn's. it runs in my family. my main symptom is frequent nausea and vomiting, and by frequent I mean every day, sometimes multiple times a day. no specific food/drink (except coffee and alcohol) triggers it. tested negative for celiac. main triggers I've found are:
1. if i'm exercising, even a light amount for a prolonged period of time
2. if i'm stressed or very excited
3. i wake up early in the morning

as you can imagine this leads to me throwing up a lot as all 3 triggers are naturally a part of life. 
i also have diarrhea and frequent bowel movements, but not so much that it is affecting my ability to live and work comfortably. my mom thinks Crohn's is out of the question as ""it's not that bad"". 
so I guess I just wanna ask, how did your Crohn's first show up? does anyone else vomit as much as I do? anything is appreciated, I just want some more knowledge on this. thank you all!!",2,1736290332.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

It’s hard to explain, but when I’m at home, I do a lot of nothing for myself. I’ll sometimes at the very least wash my face x2 a day, throw in a shower, or maybe brush my teeth.

But I’m unemployed and when I do go out, I’m in sweatpants / maybe I showered / maybe my teeth are brushed - who knows. 

Before my diagnoses I got up an extra hour or two early for work just to shower, do my hair, and put on my make up. Now it’s going on 4 years later this summer and I feel gross and not like myself.

I mean i had friends over for the weekend and one of my friends got up and put jeans on then left to go home. Jeans. I can’t even tell you the last time I wore jeans out, but I know I feel better when I do sometimes. 

I don’t like to shower, because I hate waiting for my hair to dry or drying it myself.

I hate wearing normal clothes, because I hate my body and am ashamed I gained so much because of lithium / seroquel (mentally I’m fine though, so there’s no getting rid of those two) plus sweats are just easier and don’t look TOO weird on me. 

I don’t actually hate brushing my teeth, but I’m not a fan, since if I do it before coffee: coffee tastes weird. If I do it after: I lost the coffee taste. 

Where do I start, because I really need help feeling better.

Do I drink hot lemon water every day? Is it meditation? Is it a chapter a day?
