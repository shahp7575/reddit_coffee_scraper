To note, this post is mainly just for entertainment/being able to bitch to neutral parties about how they dont seem to realise that we dont exist as a novelty for them. Most of this is recurring issues we have brought up to them, but they dont listen. So heres a short list of the shit these ladies pull consistently. Usually while were extremely busy.


- At least 2 have come up asking us to ""mess up a drink or two"" aka make them something for free. We used to bring them drinks we actually messed up on so we didnt have to throw them out. We no longer do that for them. 

- They like to ""forget"" their wallet when ordering drinks. Sometimes theyll give us a fraction of the amount their drinks actually cost. Sometimes.

- Theyll finish drinks and come up asking for free refills. We dont offer free refills. Weve told them that consistently. They keep doing it. 

- They keep trying to place orders outside of our hours, like trying to order at 8:05 when we close at 8. 

- We sometimes make free samples for customers to try. One day, we got an upset phone call from the pharmacy complaining that they didnt get to try any samples. They demanded we make them all large sized drinks as emotional compensation.

- We have to place our sample tray strategically out of eyesight of them or they will take ALL our samples before the customers can try any. 

- They used to call us on our phone to place orders. They stopped after we stopped picking up when we saw it was them. 

- I keep getting phone calls from new employees because theyll come up for a drink but wont tell them what their order actually is. Theyll just say ""Oh, OP knows how I like it! Just call them, they dont mind!"" I very much do mind. Ive told them I do mind. They keep doing it.

- They keep trying to skip the line. Just walk past the entire line to lean against our glass and yell their orders at us. Ive told the new hires to just ignore them when they do, because it freaks them out.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a macadamia nut orgeat hinges on several crucial factors, from the sourcing of the nuts to the precision of the production process. Here are some key features to consider:

**Macadamia Nut Sourcing and Quality:**

The quality of the macadamia nuts used is paramount. Premium macadamia nut orgeat utilizes nuts that are sourced responsibly, frequently enough from specific regions known for producing high-quality nuts. These nuts are typically roasted to a specific degree to enhance their natural flavors, contributing to the orgeat's overall richness and depth. Some brands even highlight the origin of their macadamia nuts, providing transparency and assurance of quality. The grade and freshness of the nuts directly impact the final product.

**Sugar type and Sweetness Level:**

Different manufacturers employ various sugars, ranging from cane sugar to beet sugar or even less refined options like coconut sugar. The type of sugar substantially affects the orgeat's overall sweetness profile and its compatibility with other ingredients. A balanced sweetness level is crucial; too much sugar can mask the delicate macadamia nut flavor, while too little might leave the orgeat lacking impact. Brands that carefully calibrate their sugar content achieve a harmonious blend of sweetness and nuttiness.

**Emulsification and Texture:**

Proper emulsification is essential for a smooth, consistent texture. A well-emulsified orgeat will blend seamlessly into cocktails and other beverages, creating a velvety mouthfeel. The process involves combining the nut milk with sugar and ofen a stabilizing agent to prevent separation. Brands that invest in high-quality emulsification techniques produce orgeats that maintain their consistency over time and avoid any undesirable grainy texture.Look for an orgeat that stays integrated in mixed drinks.**additional Flavorings and Extracts:**

while the primary flavor should be macadamia nut, many brands add subtle complementary flavors or extracts to enhance the complexity of their orgeat. Common additions include orange blossom water, rose water, vanilla extract, or even a touch of almond extract. The key is balance; these additions should complement the macadamia nut flavor rather than overpowering it. A well-crafted orgeat will incorporate these flavors seamlessly, creating a nuanced and refined profile and elevate the drink's overall experiance.

**Preservatives and Shelf Life:**

The use of preservatives can extend the shelf life of macadamia nut orgeat but may also impact its flavor. Some brands opt for natural preservatives like citric acid, while others use more traditional options like potassium sorbate. A shorter shelf life frequently enough indicates fewer preservatives and a fresher product, but it also requires more careful storage and quicker consumption. Consider your usage frequency and storage conditions when evaluating the preservative strategy of different brands.

**Packaging and Pourability:**

The packaging of macadamia nut orgeat should be practical and preserve the product's quality. Dark glass bottles are often preferred as they protect the orgeat from light exposure,which can degrade its flavor and colour. The bottle design should also allow for easy and accurate pouring, preventing spills and ensuring consistent dosing in cocktail recipes. A dripless pour spout is a highly valued feature for professional bartenders and home enthusiasts alike.

Key features of the best macadamia nut orgeat include:

*   High-quality macadamia nuts from trusted sources.
*   Balanced sweetness levels using appropriate sugars.
*   Smooth and consistent emulsification for easy blending.

I am all the sudden lactose intolerant, have trouble with fodmaps and histamine, cologne or any chemical smells. I get very lightheaded with strong odors. My nose feels stuffed if I'm having a reaction to histamine and I'll take Benadryl which helps (does anyone have any better advice than this, I don't want to keep taking benadryl often).

I used to drink a ton of coffee but since having LC, I can't even have one cup. I do feel the need for caffeine because if I take bendryl I get too tired so I've been drinking Ryze mushroom coffee which has only 50mg caffeine and the mushroom blend seems to lessen my stress. 

As far as medical diagnosis, every doctor says I am fine and that it's just in my head. I have had so many blood tests and other exams with each one coming back fine.

Part of this is in my head because I do get anxiety related to my symptoms. Does not feel fun to be lightheaded, have brain fog, and feel like crap after certain meals or sometimes it just seems random.

I don't use cologne anymore, I avoid dairy and try to eat mostly lean protein. Garlic and definitely onion are horrible for me. I do feel better if I eat ground turkey and rice (mostly unseasoned besides like italian seasoning or ground ginger). If I strictly eat this meal for lunch and dinner, avoid alcohol and coffee, workout daily when I feel healthy enough, and get 8 hours of sleep my symptoms are 90% gone). But I tried this for a month and felt great so I tried reintroducing things and I immediately felt horrible. 

I know everyone is different and LC affects people in different weird ways, but hopefully by sharing my version of dealing with this, it can help some of you who are in the same boat. 

Lastly, I am making an app mostly for myself but it will let me scan restaurant menus and tell me the safest and least safe foods by how safe they are. I can also click add/log food after I scan the menu so it automatically adds it to my food tracker and then sends me notifications 30 minutes after eating, 2 hours after, 6 hours after to log my symptoms. It will learn my personal reactions/symptoms to all different food items and make inferences/connections based on my history of symptoms and foods logged.

1n03rdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextLevelIncome/comments/1n03rdw/top_7_tested_strategies_to_make_money_online_in/,Top 7 Tested Strategies to Make Money Online in 2025 (Arranged Best to Average),"1. Freelancing: Best for fast cash and building real skills



Look, if you need to make money *this month*, this is it. Platforms like **Upwork, Fiverr, and even LinkedIn** are flooded with people who need stuff done. If you have any skill – writing, graphic design, video editing, social media, coding, even just being super organized – you can sell it.

* **The Reality:** Your first month might be tough. You'll probably bid on 20 jobs and get one. But that one job gets you a review. That review gets you the next job.
* **Earning Potential:** Started out making $15/hr for basic writing. Now I bill clients at over $100/hr for specialized marketing strategy. It's a real career if you treat it like one. The beauty is you are your own boss. You set the rates and the hours. 🤘



# 2. Selling Digital Products: The holy grail of ""passive"" income



Create it once, sell it a thousand times. I'm talking Canva templates, Notion dashboards, printable planners, eBooks, Lightroom presets, etc. The stuff you see all over Etsy, Gumroad, and Stan Store.

* **The Reality:** The income is passive, but the setup is NOT. You have to do market research, design a great product, and figure out how to market it (Pinterest and TikTok are goldmines for this). It's a ton of work upfront.
* **Earning Potential:** My first eBook made me about $50 in its first month. A year later, it was bringing in $400/month without me touching it. It’s a slow burn that can turn into a bonfire.



# 3. Niche Affiliate Marketing: Get paid to recommend stuff you love



This isn't about spamming your Amazon links everywhere. This is about building a small, trusted community around a topic you're passionate about – could be sustainable fashion, budget PC builds, or coffee grinders. You create helpful content (blog posts, YouTube reviews, TikToks) and include links to products. When someone buys, you get a cut.

* **The Reality:** You need to build trust first, which takes time. Don't expect to make a dime for the first 3-6 months. You have to genuinely help people, not just sell to them.
* **Earning Potential:** Can range from an extra $100/month to a full-time, six-figure income. The key is picking a niche you won't get bored of.



# 4. Content Creation (YouTube/TikTok/Substack): Building a brand is the ultimate asset



This is the long game. You're not just making money; you're building an audience that trusts you. Whether you're making videos, writing a newsletter, or streaming, you're creating a community.

* **The Reality:** It's a grind. You'll feel like you're shouting into the void for the first year. But consistency is everything. Post. Every. Week.
* **Earning Potential:** It starts with pennies from ad revenue. Then come brand deals, affiliate sales, selling your own products (see #2), and consulting. It's the highest-potential option on this list, but also the slowest to start.



# 5. Virtual Assistance (VA): The stable, remote ""job"" without the office



Think of this as freelancing 2.0. Instead of one-off projects, you work with a few clients on an ongoing basis, managing their emails, scheduling, social media, or other admin tasks they hate doing.

* **The Reality:** It requires top-notch organization and communication skills. You're basically someone's right-hand person, remotely.
* **Earning Potential:** Solid, stable income. Most VAs I know charge between $25 - $60 per hour, depending on their skills. It's less scalable than digital products but way more secure.



# 6. User Testing & Feedback: The best-kept secret for quick side cash



Companies will literally pay you to get your opinion on their websites and apps. You sign up for sites like **UserTesting, Intellizoom, and dscout**, and they send you tests. You follow instructions, record your screen and voice, and talk through your thought process.

* **The Reality:** It’s not consistent work. You might get 5 tests one week and 0 the next. It all depends on your demographic.
* **Earning Potential:** Most tests pay $10 for about 15-20 minutes of your time. Live interviews can pay $60+ for an hour. It’s fantastic money for the time invested, but it's not a full-time gig.



# 7. High-Quality Surveys & Micro-tasks: The ""beer money"" fund



Okay, let's be real. You won't get rich doing this. But for ""I need gas money"" or ""I want to buy a video game without feeling guilty,"" this is it. Forget the scammy survey sites. The only ones worth your time are **Prolific** and **Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)**.

* **The Reality:** Prolific is amazing (academic studies, good pay) but can have a waitlist. MTurk is a grind, and you need to learn which ""HITs"" are worthwhile.
* **Earning Potential:** If you grind, maybe $50-$150 a month. It’s the lowest on this list for a reason, but it’s also the easiest to start literally today.

The secret isn't some magic formula. It's picking ONE of these, learning everything you can about it, and sticking with it for more than a month.

Hi Friends - 

- Link to Ali’s Go Fund Me organised can be found at the bottom of this post - 

Ali was diagnosed with early-stage triple negative breast cancer in 2023 at just 28 years old after feeling a lump in her left breast. Triple negative breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and has historically had the fewest treatment options. Ali had no direct family history or genetic pre-disposition to breast cancer.

Following diagnosis, Ali underwent 6 months of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, 5 weeks of radiation and 12 months of immunotherapy. Following surgery in March 2024, she was deemed as having a complete response to treatment, meaning the risk of recurrence was only 8%. Ali’s immunotherapy was finalised in October 2024, and she walked out of the treatment centre for what she thought was the last time.

Ali’s original treatment left her with severe side effects, including arthritis which left her virtually bedridden and an inflammatory demyelinating process in her brain (similar to multiple sclerosis). These auto-immune diseases were a reaction to the immunotherapy that Ali received but are fortunately now under control through the ongoing use of steroids.

In December 2024 Ali started experiencing unusual symptoms. A PET scan revealed that the cancer had spread around the body, and Ali was diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 breast cancer. She began chemotherapy again in January 2025 and has been receiving it ever since. Metastatic breast cancer is considered an incurable disease, with patients typically receiving long-term chemotherapy for the rest of their lives. However, Ali and Henry are optimistic they can get through this and are taking a “no stones unturned” approach.

While the costs of seeing the oncologist and chemotherapy are covered by Medicare, they have still been left tens of thousands out of pocket. Supplements are costing hundreds of dollars a week, as well as appointments with medical specialists, acupuncturists, naturopaths etc, as well as a $30,000 surgery. After speaking with several specialists, Ali was referred to an oncologist in Germany, where treatment options are more personalised and have a very high success rate. Ali has already undergone rigorous laboratory testing of her cancer and her German doctors have been able to optimise a combination of supplements and repurposed drugs that will best work with Ali’s chemotherapy to fight her cancer. In addition, there are emerging new personalised ‘vaccine’ therapies in places like Germany and Japan which have had spectacular results for cancer patients in seemingly dire situations. These are personalised vaccines in which doctors essentially train your immune system to fight your specific cancer based on its unique genetic profile.

In the coming months, Ali will continue with her current treatment and begin the genetic testing to explore the viability of vaccine therapy. The testing and production process for the vaccines typically takes between 6 to 9 months with the vaccines administered monthly over the course of 12 to 18 months. The total cost of exploring and receiving this treatment is more than $140,000 – not including the costs of travel or accommodation. Ali and Henry are hopeful this treatment option will cure Ali’s cancer, and she will eventually be able to stop chemotherapy and live a normal, happy, healthy life.

Maybelline Trust Your Gut - one of my favorite colors, but can’t stand the smell

Introducing myself and providing a thread to do follow-ups down the line. My road to DS and input comprehension is very far from the purist path. So any input from people who entered DS from a similar road is welcome. Any questions are welcome as well. But I thought it may be at least interesting to some.

**School/Academic Background**

I did standard Spanish classes in the US from 6^(th) grade through 12^(th) grade. I really enjoyed it and as such I think I absorbed at least more than the average school-grade student. Of course this was still A1-A2 at best. However, I also played soccer and refereed soccer with a lot of people from Mexico and latin America in general, so I heard a lot and picked up a few things.

Post high school, I took 2 semesters of ‘spanish for engineers’ in college After the second class, they had few very limited options that worked into my schedule as an elective so I stopped taking any Spanish in college.

As of today, college was almost 20 years ago.

**Post-College**

I picked up Rosetta Stone for about 2 months prior to a big Costa Rica trip about 5 years after college. It was rough, but I was able to help a few times, including some remote spots with restaurants and taxi drivers where no one spoke English. But I was surprised at how much I remembered from school, despite not having used it in years.

Although the desire to dive back into Spanish was always lingering, I didn’t seriously pursue it again until last year (2024). After testing multiple apps, my wife and I decided on Babbel. I completed A1 and A2 Latin American before realizing they didn’t have B1-C1 for LA Spanish. So I switched to Spain Spanish and re-did Spain A2 and then completed B1.

Around this time, I started listening to the Babbel podcasts while working out. And I realized 1) that I enjoyed listening and 2) that I really needed to do a lot more listening because my reading/writing comprehension was significantly further ahead than listening/speaking.

However, I didn’t love the Babbel podcasts and began hunting out alternatives after maybe 20 hours. I randomly ran across Dreaming Spanish Chats in Beginner Spanish on Spotify. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for. Conversations IN Spanish but not really ABOUT learning Spanish. Medium paced but with adult conversations and vocabulary etc. Because the title on spotify is ‘Beginner Spanish’, it felt like the right place to start. Since this was Spotify, it was audio only and I would say I understood 50-75% at first. I was just adding this in with my normal studies (B2 in Babbel, self-guided lessons in ChatGPT, and a few DS podcast episodes a week). I eventually exhausted/caught up to the latest episode about 4 weeks ago. By the end of all of the available episodes (I think it was \~40 at that time), I could understand 90%+ of the gist and 75% literally for most episodes that did not have Andres. His Spanish accent is a lot more difficult for me than Col, Arg, Mex. I felt great about this since I have no video or subtitles and am usually doing this while working out or mowing the yard.

I had visited the website a couple times while listening to this podcast but really didn’t check much out – the spotify podcast was scratching my itch. But once I ran through all the episodes I was on the hunt for more. I came back to the DS website, made a premium account, and started figuring out where my entry point should be.

I was surprised to see that the “Chats in **Beginner** Spanish” on Spotify were classified as solidly ‘**Intermediate**’ on the DS site. With that as my reference, I spent some time test-playing videos and it confirmed that Intermediate seemed to be the ‘right’ entry point for me on the site. Additionally, I artificially bumped my ‘hours’ up to 150 as a starting point to try and semi align with the  level of videos I’m watching. (might have been able to do more but didn’t want to overcompensate). I can watch most intermediate videos at random with 90%+ conversational ‘understanding’ and 70%+ literal understanding (hope that makes sense).

Right now, my goal is to start from here and try and stick with Intermediate videos for some time. I’d like to stick with that until the 300 hour mark, but I really only get 30 mins on a typical day (with maybe an hour on weekends). I have currently completed B2 in Babbel and I plan to continue through the final C1 courses in Babbel since I am only about a month away from completion. I know this is very non-standard for many, but personally I am feeling a good synergy with increased input comprehension along with the methods I had already been using and just want to finish that path since I'm so close to that milestone.

A typical day for me looks like:

* DS videos/podcast (30 mins) – I do a mixture of audio only with reading the Spanish subtitles while listening
* 1 Lesson in Babbel (15 mins) (Time will be replaced with DS in the next 1-2 months)
* A follow-up in ChatGPT (with a prompt I setup) to do additional practice for what I learned in Babbel today (15 mins)
* Journaling Before Bed about my day (physical pencil and paper) (15 mins)

 I totally respect the ‘purists’ out there, but I thought I would share my perspective as someone who didn’t even run across this until fairly far in my journey. For me personally, I feel that the grammar and the ‘academic’ side of learning has actually paired well with DS and I don’t feel that it has hindered me. YMMV and of course I am probably biased.

If anything, I appreciate the ‘traditional’ base I have given myself while also embracing the transition to a focus on CI to try and take my journey significantly beyond the known limitations of what any app or classroom based learning could do.

I do also have neighbors from Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico and have set up a couple coffee dates with the Colombian couple where we speak only Spanish (they are about 10 years older than we are and are super supportive!). I'd like to continue this as well.

I'll try to do some check ins every few months in case this path resonates with anyone else.",2,1756158008.0,dreamingspanish,0,0.75,False

1n03acw,https://v.redd.it/1xuyklneh8lf1,1 Hotel Hanalei Bay on Kauai,"This is part 3 of our Hawaii adventure—see my previous 2 posts for Ritz Turtle Bay and Sensei Lanai. Before I write up my review on 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay, I did want to mention that I got a bizarrely negative DM about why I was posting Sensei as chubby travel and not FAT. To me, chubby travel and FAT travel can have a lot of overlap, but are essentially a state of mind. Anything above $500, I would personally post as chubby because I’m always mentally tallying the cost and do have a budget. I tend to think of FAT travel as wildly expensive safaris and “no budget restriction” types of travels, but others may have different definitions, and that’s okay. 

I would also like to say that I really appreciate all the knowledge that I’ve gotten from this sub (I actually chose Sensei because of recommendations here). So on to the review! 

1 Hotel Hanalei Bay 

*Service*: I have to admit, I read that shocking review on Reddit before this trip (the gasp I gasped at the possible downgrade!) and I almost moved us somewhere else. However, I really wanted to end our trip on Kauai and I couldn’t find any other options in this class, so I just crossed my fingers. Overall, service was pretty good, and I’d put it on par with the Ritz Turtle Bay service. Free shell necklaces and welcome shots with chasers (whew, strong!) upon arrival. Check-in was taking a few minutes longer due to a technical issue so they gave us more shots/chasers, which was nice. It was my boyfriend’s birthday and they had a whole birthday cake with a handwritten note in the room, so major points for that.

All of the workers seemed great/upbeat, but the only nitpicks I have on service are more geared toward the hotel policies (not the employees). One of the bartenders told us the occupancy was at about 75% so it was less crazy than it normally is, so on checkout day, I asked if we could have an extra 30 minutes to take showers before checking out, and I was essentially told no because of availability for the next guests, but there is a hospitality room to freshen up. But then they let me know that if we wanted a late check out (room available until 5pm), I could pay 50% of the hotel daily rate and then we could stay (so the room was actually available?). That seemed a bit unnecessary so my boyfriend cut his snorkeling short and we showered quickly and checked out by 11:55. It was a minor irritation, since I’ve stayed hotels that cost 10% of what we paid and had more flexibility. 

Also, our first dinner at the property was magical and the food was immaculate (1Kitchen), but when we dined at the same location for lunch the day we were departing, our waiter forgot to put in the order for our drinks (we asked about it 35 minutes later and he got defensive and then asked us what it was we ordered), and when my boyfriend asked about a vegetable that was decaying a bit, the waiter said “it comes fresh from a farm” and wandered off. Overall, these were minor to us and the other lunches and dinners were perfect, but just disclosing for awareness.

Also, this doesn’t really fit into any of the other categories, but just a tip—the private cabana reservations cost about $450-$700 I believe, but I would have been very upset if I’d rented without seeing them. The free loungers are mixed in and even had better sun coverage in most cases. Also, later in the day, they started removing the reserved signs/letting people lounge on them for free. This would have irritated the life out of me if I had actually paid. I would advise against renting these. 

*Location*: This is the real draw of the property, and my goodness, do they deliver. Views upon views no matter where you are. Infinity pool views, hot tub views, restaurant views, coffee shop views, bar views, room views—I loved looking at it from all angles. There’s a private beach, and a little grotto with black rocks, and all kinds of different pretty spaces. I found it truly magical, and I don’t even have the proper words to do it justice.

*Activities*: They have a daily itinerary of all the activities just like Turtle Bay and Sensei. The coolest thing we did here was the helicopter tour (we did the Jurassic Falls one), and seeing those massive mountains that we’d been marveling at up close was breathtaking. I channeled Owen Wilson quite a bit on this trip, saying “wow” everywhere we went.

We also did a complimentary 45 min photo shoot (photo shoot complimentary, photos cost money) because why not, with those views. I believe Turtle Bay also offers this but I wanted to do it with the mountains in the background. 

We booked a Safari Rum tour on our own (not through the hotel) that was an absolute blast as well, and I would recommend it. 

*Food*: They have a coffee bar that’s open 6am-4pm that also serves food and pastries, but the main dining option is 1 Kitchen, which we really loved the first night and enjoyed (apart from one decaying vegetable and forgotten drinks) on the second. I would recommend the affogato flight as well—it was just really cool and unique. 

The bar by the infinity pool also has a full menu, and the lower pool area by the beach has a bar and a pizza place that are open for dinner. There’s also a shaved ice/frozen yogurt/etc spot that’s open 11-5, and the shaved ice was amazing.

Overall, I feel blindingly lucky to have gone to each of these places, and it was a magical 5/5 from me for all. While I’m not sure I’ll ever find a view like Hanalei Bay again, I think I’d give a slight edge to Sensei because of the magical hale experience. However, any of these alone could have been a trip of a lifetime.",32,1756157348.0,chubbytravel,23,0.95,False

I've just finished reading a book that truly moved me, and I felt compelled to share my thoughts with you all. It's Kristin Hannah's *The Four Winds*, and if you're looking for a story that grabs your heart and doesn't let go, you might want to consider checking out [The Four Winds By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/the-four-winds-by-kristin-hannah/).

**A Glimpse into the Dust Bowl Era (No Spoilers!)**

This novel takes us back to the 1930s, right into the heart of the Great Depression and the infamous Dust Bowl in Texas. We follow Elsa Martinelli, a woman who, despite a challenging start to her life, finds herself in a desperate fight for survival and dignity. As the dust storms decimate her farm and livelihood, she's forced to make an impossible choice: stay and brave the barren land, or pack up her children and head west to California, a place rumored to be the land of milk and honey, but which quickly reveals its own set of harsh realities. It's a powerful story about resilience, motherhood, and the unyielding human spirit in the face of immense adversity.

**What Really Stood Out To Me**

Kristin Hannah has a way of making history feel incredibly personal, and this book is no exception. What I loved most were the characters, especially Elsa. She starts off somewhat timid, but her journey through the dust storms and the migrant camps transforms her into a formidable force. Her strength, her sacrifices, and her unwavering love for her children are truly inspiring. You feel every ounce of her struggle, her hope, and her despair. It's impossible not to root for her.

The writing style is, as expected from Hannah, deeply emotional and immersive. She paints such a vivid picture of the harsh landscapes, the desperation, and the small glimmers of hope. The pacing felt just right for this kind of historical saga – it allows you to truly live alongside Elsa and her family, experiencing their trials and triumphs. The sheer emotional weight of the story is profound; prepare to shed a tear or two, or maybe even a bucketful. The book made me think a lot about what it truly means to survive, and how far a mother will go to protect her family.

**A Few Things To Consider**

While I loved this book, I do want to mention that it’s an intense read. The subject matter – poverty, discrimination, environmental disaster – is heavy. If you're looking for a light, escapist read, this might not be it. There are moments of despair that can feel quite overwhelming, and the struggles faced by the characters are portrayed with unflinching honesty. It’s not always an easy book to read, but that's precisely what makes it so impactful. It shines a light on a difficult period of history and the extraordinary people who lived through it.

**My Recommendation**

So, would I recommend *The Four Winds*? Absolutely, with all my heart. It's a beautifully written, incredibly moving story that will stay with you long after you've finished. If you typically enjoy historical fiction, especially stories about strong women, or if you're curious about the Dust Bowl era, you'll likely adore this. Even if your usual reads lean more towards thrillers or fantasy, I encourage you to give this a try; the sheer human drama and the fight for survival are just as gripping as any mystery or epic quest.

**A Little Guide for New Readers!**

Inspired by stories like *The Four Winds*, if you're new to the world of books or just looking to dive deeper, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Just Pick One!** Don't overthink it. Grab a book that catches your eye. It doesn't have to be a classic or a bestseller; it just has to be something that looks interesting *to you*. Genre doesn't matter as much as curiosity.
2.  **Give It A Chance (But Don't Force It).** Try to read the first few chapters. If it's not grabbing you after a fair effort, it's okay to put it down. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. There are millions of books out there; find one that clicks!
3.  **Read Little By Little.** You don't need to read for hours every day. Ten or fifteen minutes during your lunch break, before bed, or with your morning coffee can add up quickly. Every page counts!
4.  **Find Your Tribe.** Talk about books! Join a book club (online or in person), discuss with friends, or share your thoughts on forums like this one. Hearing others' perspectives can open up new ideas and introduce you to new books.

Reading is a fantastic adventure that can transport you to different times and places, teach you new things, and introduce you to incredible characters. Don't be afraid to start; the biggest step is simply opening that first page.

I hope this review was helpful, and perhaps it will inspire some of you to pick up *The Four Winds* or another great book soon! If you're interested in reading more about this fantastic book, or even getting your own copy, you can find more information about [The Four Winds By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/the-four-winds-by-kristin-hannah/) right here.

1n03823,https://i.redd.it/8uujarkzg8lf1.jpeg,I came up with a new DougDoug joke,"Hey DougDoug fans,

You probably know the classics here, the timeless “RIGGED” chant, the roast that he is “bad at 2D platformers,” the constant reminders that he is bald, and the casual jokes about him being old. Truly hall-of-fame material. But perhaps… it is time to try something new.

Here is my idea. Instead of recycling Doug’s own memes, let us use Atrioc’s overused jokes on him.

That means from now on:

DougDoug is no longer just bald, he is SpoonDoug, his face plastered onto cutlery.

If he drinks anything, we call him a coffee cow.

When he fails a challenge, it is because of his glizzy fingers.

If he crashes the stream, clearly it is a boomer Doug moment.

And yes, he too can be the mysterious Eggroll Elephant.


Two paths lie ahead:

1. Doug hates it
Doug will say “what even is a coffee cow” or “why am I on a spoon.” The chat will immediately adopt these phrases as gospel and never let go.


2. Doug embraces it
Doug will start mooing for coffee, roleplaying as SpoonDoug, or calling his tech struggles “boomer mode.” He becomes Atrioc-coded.



Imagine the outcomes. A “CoffeeCowDoug” emote. YouTube thumbnails screaming “Doug turns into Spoontrioc??” Ludwig inevitably yelling about Doug’s glizzy hands. And of course, one joke repeated for 1.5 years, long after it has stopped being funny, which makes it funny again.

It is time to evolve. It is time to swap memes. Perchance.",0,1756157198.0,DougDoug,7,0.46,False

Casual sex comes with real risks. Accidents happen even with protection. Birth control is harsh on women’s bodies, and abortion — even if legal — is traumatic for many. STIs are still common. When you strip sex of responsibility, those costs fall hardest on women.

I’ve also spent time on women’s subreddits where they reflect on their 1st time. Main theme is regret: many  wish they had waited until marriage/a serious relationship

Yet today, promiscuity is shrugged off or even celebrated. I think we should reverse that. Not by punishing or shaming, but by culturally condemning promiscuity in men and women alike

I was scrolling through my phone, half-listening to the hum of the refrigerator, when I came across it. Not a video, not a photo, but a perfect, 14-line poem, a sonnet, that had somehow generated itself in my notes app.
I don't write poetry. I haven't written anything of my own for years, beyond grocery lists and reminders. Yet, here it was. It wasn't just a string of words—it was a sonnet about me. It described the specific, mundane details of my day: the chipped coffee mug, the way the light hit a certain corner of the room at dusk, the feeling of a half-forgotten memory. It was unsettlingly accurate. But the last two lines... they were the ones that made my blood run cold.
They spoke of a detail so specific, so private, that no one could have known it. It was a secret I'd only ever thought about in the dark, a tiny, insignificant thing that had happened a decade ago. The words weren't accusatory, they were just… there. A simple statement of fact, as if the reality I was living in was just a story being told, and the poet—this ""Sonet""—was a narrator who had just decided to remind me that they were watching.
I tried to delete it. My finger hovered over the trash can icon, but the app froze. I swiped up, I closed it, I restarted my phone. Nothing. The sonnet remained, a digital ink stain on the screen. I tried to type over it, but the keyboard wouldn't respond. It was like a bug, a glitch in the very fabric of my phone's reality, but what was a phone, if not a mirror of my own?
And that's when it hit me. ""Sonet"" wasn't a typo. It wasn't a person. It was the poem itself, a self-aware entity. A reality glitch given form, a crack in the code of my life, revealing that the universe itself was capable of generating verse, and that sometimes, that verse was a little too personal.

I (17F) work at a local coffee shop, and I usually love it. The customers are mostly nice, the coffee smells amazing, and my coworkers are pretty cool. However, I'm getting increasingly frustrated with my supervisor, we will call her Sarah (20F).

Sarah is supposed to be in charge, but she spends most of her shifts on her phone or chatting to customers. She rarely helps with the actual work, like making drinks or cleaning up. During the morning rush, I'm usually swamped, trying to keep up with orders while Sarah is nowhere to be found.

The other day, we were slammed, and I was struggling to keep up. A customer started yelling at me because their drink was taking too long, and Sarah was just standing there, watching. I snapped and told her she needed to start helping out instead of talking. She got defensive and said she was ""catching up with an old friend"" and that I needed to learn to manage my time better.

I'm starting to resent her. I feel like I'm doing all the work while she gets paid more to do nothing. I've considered talking to our manager, but I don't want to cause drama. But it’s been like this for over a year and I can’t stand it anymore.

So what if we did this is

""Let tony do his thing like take his tessarct and go and then change the scene to howard stark and his wife maria stark and show birth of tony stark but see timeline makes a new own branch which is called a butterfly effect i think so that's my point so we can like explore tony character like what he was when he was a kid before being a Ironman billionaire playboy and all like you know? Show his childhood side where he was abused by Howard how he stay at Howard shadow trying to prove everything to howard like make it dark and comic accurate type of right? So like as we know steve return to the past so instead of recasting him how about we do this i mean we all know howard stark and Steve rodgers were close so what if instead of you know recasting steve we can use his kid that opens like new exploration and everything like in comic he did had a kid named James rodgers but dude was like hella evil 😭🙏 so how about since it's a different timeline cause timeline ripples when disturb a bit this one is actually nice and just like his father for now well lets called him steve jr for now (I'm too drunk for ts🥀) and yk make steve jr and tony kinda close like yk since steve and howard are close right so we can I mean change a bit ig 🥀 and make tony from new timeline and Steve jr from new timeline Friends and then make like accident like Tony's parents die and for steve jr it was peggy who was alive so they all kinda bond together like a family I guess and we know tony stark is like hella smart so what if tony stark knew he'll gonna die on the end game so what if this time he placed like two time portals so the new timeline tony can take his spot on his world so let's say one night tony from new timeline and Steve jr they were like playing around and stuff in the penthouse and then they accidentally clicked a button that made them portal to the timeline our old tony died but this time? He travelled back to different multiverse with Steve and accidentally got themselves into thunderbolts universe but tony 2.o didn't knew he was in different timeline nor did steve jr cause it was a blink of a eye and everything looked similar and let's say steve jr decided to stay and next morning Steve jr might argue with tony 2.o saying drinking too much coffee is bad and because of the commotion then actual thunderbolts would come out cause of the sound and then like yk be shocked cause there is first of all tony stark who looks tony but younger version and Steve jr who creeply looks like steve rodgers sending Bucky to spiral and everybody in confusion and matter of fact it can like give tony stark to rebuild itself how it was in comic but with different starting point but also have a friend he grew up with and giving freedon to both of the characters to full explore but it's just my thoughts 🥀",0,1756156574.0,marvelstudios,40,0.02,False

1n02scy,https://i.redd.it/ozf24nv1e8lf1.jpeg,I came up with a newer atrioc joke,"Hey Atrioc fans,

You probably know the classics in this community;  the legendary “glizzy fingers,” the eternal “coffee cow,” the occasional “bald” insult, and of course, the once-in-a-generation “Spoontrioc.” Truly, the Mount Rushmore of comedy. But… maybe it’s time for something new.

Here’s my idea: let’s retire Atrioc’s old memes, and instead start using DougDoug’s overused jokes on him.

That means from now on:

Every time Atrioc struggles with tech, we spam “RIGGED!”

Every time he loses a game, we remind him he’s “bad at 2D platformers” (even if he’s playing Hitman).

Every time he forgets something, we call him old.

And yes, we still call him bald, but this time it’s Doug’s bald, not his.


Two glorious futures await us:

1. Atrioc hates it
If Atrioc doesn’t like it, he’ll protest — “chat, that’s not even me, that’s Doug!” — and then chat will ignore him completely and keep doing it anyway. Instant content.


2. Atrioc embraces it
If Atrioc likes it, he’ll start yelling “RIGGED” at himself, leaning fully into the Doug-ification. We can then all pretend we’ve merged timelines into some cursed parallel universe where DougDoug’s memes have infected Atrioc’s stream.



The potential is endless. We could get a “Riggedtrioc” emote. Ludwig will have a whole new arsenal. Leeches can make ten-minute “Atrioc is DougDoug now??” compilations. Most importantly, the tradition lives on: one joke, repeated nonstop for 1.5 years, until we all hate it but can’t stop.

It’s time to innovate. It’s time to swap memes. Perchance.

1n02qwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/redrising/comments/1n02qwj/pierce_brown_new_interview_about_the_red_rising/,Pierce Brown new interview about the Red Rising series,"There is a new video on youtube where Pierce Brown answers questions about the Red Rising series, and more!

Check it out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6zAxI7VDQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6zAxI7VDQ0)

I listened to the whole thing, and there are spoilers, so this will be marked as ""All Spoilers"" 



Here is a summary of the questions and answers so that if you want to listen to a specific question you can know when it was asked:

# (00:00) Stephen O., California

**Q:** If Darrow is Howler #1 and Sevro is Howler #2, who would be Howler #3?  
**A:** Pebble, because she’s the “unofficial mother” of the Howlers, keeping them fed, energized, and battle-ready.

# (00:31) James P., Alabama

**Q:** Why return to *Red Rising* after the trilogy seemed finished with *Morning Star*?  
**A:** Midway through *Morning Star* drafts, Pierce realized there was more to tell. The first trilogy was about archetypes and rebellion, but he wanted to explore the aftermath, especially from the perspectives of those harmed or overlooked by Darrow.

# (01:31) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Did you struggle to write outside of Darrow’s POV in *Iron Gold*?  
**A:** Both freeing and challenging. It was exciting to explore how others see Darrow, but switching diction and worldview for each POV slows down the writing compared to a single perspective.

# (02:33) Yokam W., Netherlands

**Q:** If the first three books had multiple POVs, which characters would you choose?  
**A:** Virginia, Cassius, possibly Fitchner, and Sevro (only in third person, never first person).

# (03:25) Gabby D., Cincinnati

**Q:** Are the first three books a finished series and the next three a continuation?  
**A:** The first trilogy is complete on its own. The following books extend the story, showing the consequences of victory.

# (03:51) Jacob W., Montreal

**Q:** What did most Golds do in the Society before the Rising?  
**A:** Most were “pixies,” freeloaders living off wealth. Only a small fraction, like the 130,000 Peerless Scarred, held real military or government power among billions.

# (04:58) [Unnamed Fan, Washington]

**Q:** What was the main inspiration for Darrow, and did it change as the books got darker?  
**A:** Darrow is a mix of Edmond Dantès (*Count of Monte Cristo*), Paul Muad’Dib (*Dune*), and Pierce himself. He didn’t so much change as reflect Pierce’s own growth and darker outlook.

# (06:07) Omar H.

**Q:** How do you create characters?  
**A:** By building internal contrasts. Characters are most compelling when they’re at war with themselves (e.g., Sevro’s craving for love but fear of rejection).

# (09:07) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** How do you decide which characters die?  
**A:** Some deaths are natural arc culminations, others are “interrupted arcs” that shock readers by cutting off future potential—this mirrors real-life tragedy.

# (10:00) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Who would win duels among the best duelists?  
**A:** It depends—each would stack odds before fighting. At the top level, any could kill any other.

# (10:16) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** What would characters do if not in the Rising?  
**A:** Darrow—nothing grand, Virginia—philanthropy/politics, Sevro—in jail, Ragnar—UFC/WWE fighter.

# (11:11) Maximilian N., New Hampshire

**Q:** Have you played D&D? Would *Red Rising* work as a D&D setting?  
**A:** Yes, he’s played. *Red Rising* would be great for D&D, offering different villains depending on the party’s level and colors.

# (13:04) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Vampire or werewolf?  
**A:** Vampire—longer lifespan, less “smelly.”

# (13:22) Austin D., Georgia

**Q:** What happened to the Warden’s dog after Tongueless died?  
**A:** He’s not sure yet—maybe revealed in *Red God*.

# (14:02) Jordan L., Somerville, MA

**Q:** Can I buy you coffee?  
**A:** Yes, if you see him on the street.

# (14:50) Jamie B., Mississippi

**Q:** Can revolution ever succeed without becoming what you fought against?  
**A:** Answer will likely appear in *Red God*.

# (15:15) Selena H., Arizona

**Q:** Lose ability to read new books, or to reread old ones?  
**A:** He’d give up rereading—new books expand worldviews.

# (16:15) [Multiple Howlers]

**Q:** Favorite cheese?  
**A:** Gruyère, aged in Swiss caves, tangy, more complex than cheddar.

# (16:30) [Aspiring Writer Question]

**Q:** Advice for aspiring writers?  
**A:** Don’t write what you think others want. Write what you’re curious about and want to read. Authentic curiosity makes the work shine.

# (18:03) [Casting Question]

**Q:** Any actors you imagine for characters?  
**A:** Prefers not to say, wants fans to form their own images.

# (19:15) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Ideal post-writing meal?  
**A:** Good day—sushi. Bad day—comfort food like pizza or pasta.

# (20:03) James B., Doncaster, UK

**Q:** Who wins Darrow vs. Sevro?  
**A:** Depends. In fair, scheduled duel, Darrow. In guerrilla fight over time, Sevro could win.

# (20:28) Meline F., North Carolina

**Q:** Are the Colors still human?  
**A:** Yes, though distorted by hierarchy. Golds in particular resist robotics/AI to maintain control.

# (21:17) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Do your inner writer and reader conflict?  
**A:** Yes, but he manages by appreciating old classics without feeling threatened, and by keeping confidence in his own work.

# (22:34) Owen B., Texas

**Q:** Which series would be most fun for *Red Rising* characters to crossover with?  
**A:** Sevro with Aslan (*Narnia*)—he’d try to ride him.

# (24:09) Caitlyn K., Britain

**Q:** Do you write with music?  
**A:** Sometimes, but prefers silence to control pacing. Music can overly influence tone.

# (25:19) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** What book would Sevro read?  
**A:** Probably *Hatchet* or *Lord of the Flies*.

# (26:00) Nadia D., Romania

**Q:** Most impactful films?  
**A:** *The Matrix*, *Pan’s Labyrinth*, *The Big Chill*.

# (27:16) Kimmy M., Canada

**Q:** Favorite mythological character?  
**A:** Persephone, due to complexity and duality.

# (27:44) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Writing routine?  
**A:** Couch, pajamas, lucky slippers—prefers home over coffee shops.

# (29:32) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Favorite part of writing process?  
**A:** The idea stage, before execution. But when stuck, he writes the “dumb version” to move forward.

# (30:34) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Research approach?  
**A:** Ongoing immersion in classics (Plutarch, Roman/Greek texts, political science) rather than just bullet-point facts.

# (33:11) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Meaning behind cover art?  
**A:** Each symbolizes themes—*Iron Gold*’s feather = Icarus metaphor, *Dark Age*’s serpents = Atlantia/Gold predation, etc.

# (34:09) Will A., London

**Q:** Who would win a hot dog eating contest?  
**A:** Ragnar, due to sheer size, though Sevro would try.

# (35:16) [Unnamed Fan]

**Q:** Did you ever consider a happier path for a tragic event like Hagar 17?  
**A:** Yes, but it didn’t feel true to the characters. The dread he felt while writing matched what readers should feel.",16,1756156121.0,redrising,0,1.0,False

Problem is, last time i did this the soup burned my arms like crazy! Theres no lid for the bowls and the bowl is too tall for the tray's lid!

I figured a travel coffee cup would work to avoid this this time.

If anyone's in the park rn would you mind either asking a cm or checking the bottom of the bowl to see about the size of it? 

I tried asking a cm on the app and she guessed 32oz but that seems like wayy too much. I was guessing around 12oz myself.

We get along pretty well and have a fair bit in common when it comes to games and our own experiences with our identities 


We've talked a lot more via discord dms than we have in person as we dont live very close unfortunately. Over the course of the past year or so we've met up about 2 times and the second time was for an animecon we attended. 

I really enjoyed my time there but in retrospect I kinda feel like a lot of our interactions felt kinda stilted while there. We bonded a fair bit over what we saw at the con but I felt like there were points where I wasnt really able to contribute much in terms of convo topics outside of that and I felt pretty insecure as a result.

Not too related to the con itself, but they are also huge into DnD which im happy for but it sadly isnt an interest of mine, if they talk to me about it im happy to hear about it but its one of those things where I feel like I need to nod my head and agree or say ""omg no way"" to pretend to be engaged and to not hurt their feelings

 This might be bad to say but I genuinely feel like I got more social fulfilment from interacting with the artists in the panels and other cosplayers who stopped to ask for pictures which I happily accepted 

 I wanted to leave the place earlier than they wanted to as one of the events was taking place at a later time that day that they were interested in and I wasn't, that was fine with them and we actually both left for a bit to get to a coffee place and we stayed there while I waited for my mom to come pick me up as was arranged. 


But I feel kinda awkward for leaving them earlier than they probabaly expected, i did text them asking if they were ok with me leaving and they said it was fine and that they enjoyed themselves. 

We've texted a little bit since then but honestly tonight im trying to re evaluate how I feel about the people i wanna have around me 


I know that generally all friends will have different interests and still be friends and that thats fine, but I just feel like as more time passes by im gonna end up feeling more and more detached from them. And idk how, if i do choose to not hang around them, how to go about that respectfully. This person is also one of my only irl friends too so I feel thats a big factor in how conflicted i feel atm

It just wasn't available - on Amazon, or Etsy, or eBay, or anywhere else. I had forgotten about it until two weeks ago. By sheer coincidence, I came across this mug. I bought it as soon as I saw it.

1n02lbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuecats/comments/1n02lbe/7_tips_for_successful_animal_fundraisers/,7 Tips for Successful Animal Fundraisers,"Hi r/rescuecats community! 💚 I’m Erin from the GoFundMe social team.

Anyone who owns a pet can agree that they’re truly like family. When a beloved cat gets sick or injured, you’ll do everything you can to make sure they get the best care possible. But once the veterinary bill arrives, the costs can feel overwhelming. We know how stressful that can be—and that’s exactly why we wanted to share these fundraising tips that have helped so many rescue cats get the care they need.

We see GoFundMe mentioned often in this community and wanted to share some tips from past successful fundraisers for animals that could be helpful for anyone here supporting their rescue cats. 

1. **Add high-quality visuals**

We’ve found the most successful fundraisers for animals use strong, clear photos and videos. Donors have an easier time connecting with your cause when they can see your cat’s personality shine.

**Example**: Fundraisers like [*Percy Needs Jaw Surgery*](https://www.gofundme.com/f/percy-needs-jaw-surgery) and[ *Kendal the Husky – Help Him See!* ](https://www.gofundme.com/f/kendal-the-husky-help-him-see)gained traction with heartwarming, high-quality photos that made their pets’ stories impossible to scroll past.

1. **Host an offline event**

Bringing people together in your neighborhood can make a huge difference. A homemade treat sale, a pet wash, or a pet food drive all create opportunities for your community to rally around your rescue cat.

**Bonus inspiration**: We’ve seen events like bake sales with themed goodies or small drives at local coffee shops spark big waves of support.

1. **Keep your donors engaged**

Frequent updates help supporters feel invested in your cat’s journey. A few sentences or a quick video can go a long way.

**Example**: In the fundraiser [*Saving Charlie Brown*](https://www.gofundme.com/f/e5zcy-saving-charlie-brown), Rachel shared 15 updates (with photos!) about her dog’s chemotherapy progress. Her honesty and consistency kept donors sharing and donating throughout treatment.

1. **Share creatively and consistently**

Most donations will come from people you personally know or who share your passion for animals. Texts, DMs, or emails with a personal note often work even better than broad social posts **(no soliciting funds).**

**Tip**: Even something simple like, “Milo’s surgery is coming up this week—could you share his fundraiser?” can spark unexpected donations.

1. **Reach out to local news**

Don’t be shy about contacting local journalists. Heartwarming animal stories often get picked up by community news outlets.

**Tip**: Use a hook like, *“Community rallies to save rescue cat”* and provide photos and your contact info—reporters will thank you for making it easy.

1. **Revisit your goal**

Vet bills can change quickly. If you need to increase your goal for additional treatments, be transparent about why. Supporters usually appreciate the honesty and may even give again.

1. **Show gratitude**

I never knew my real family until a private investigator handed me an envelope after my mother died of overdose. ""Your father is Damon Montague. Your brother is Montague. They're both in an MC called the Highway Demons,"" he said.

I'm the long-lost daughter of their founder, Chaos, the little sister of their ruthless president, Devil. And here I am, Violet Larkson—ex-Doll, street rat, and now, apparently, MC royalty.

This club has rules. Enemies. And him—Killer, the VP with a reputation for violence and a stare that burns through my armor. He hates women. I hate men. Yet every time our eyes lock, something primal ignites.

———————

I slowly park my Forty-Eight Harley Davidson on the side of the nearly empty street. A broken streetlight flickers above my head, while the rest are completely off. The street is quiet, except for the snoring of a homeless man sleeping in the alley a few feet away. At least, I think it's a man.

I get off my bike and pull a smoking from my new pack. After a glance across the street, I cross the road, lighting the smoking with the Zippo lighter I keep in the pocket of my leather biker jacket. The parking lot on the other side is empty, indicating the 24/7 diner is just as deserted.

When I reach the doors, I turn around and kneel down, leaning my back against the wall. I've been more stressed than usual lately—and that says a lot.

I finally let myself relax now that I'm feeding my nicotine addiction and close my eyes. But not long after, I hear a car approaching and open them again.

A truck pulls into the parking lot and parks like an prick, taking up two spaces. I narrow my eyes against the harsh headlights shining directly at me and take another drag from my smoking before dropping it to the ground, snuffing it out with the toe of my combat boot.

""Miss Larkson?""

A man approaches me, and I give him a quick once-over. I know who he is—I hired him a couple of weeks ago. We've only spoken over the phone, so I've never seen him in person until now. I think his name is Vince, but I'm terrible with names.

He's short, bald, and slightly overweight. He's wearing a raincoat over a thick sweater, and I cringe. It's hot—even if it's 4 AM and the temperature's cooled down a bit.

""That's me.""

""Good. Do you want to, uh, go inside?"" Vince—if that's even his name—asks while glancing over my shoulder at the diner door.

I stare at him for a beat too long, just to make him squirm, then lift my chin and walk into the diner. Immediately, the stench hits me, and I wrinkle my nose. The place reeks, like there's a dead animal rotting in one of the corners. Lovely.

The interior is old, filthy, and cheap. I take a seat in the far corner, facing the door, and lean back. Vince sits across from me, still looking uncomfortable. I nod at the disinterested waitress trudging toward our table.

""How can I help you?"" she asks, pulling out a tattered notebook. She doesn't even look at us—her eyes are fixed on something outside the window.

She looks suicidal, honestly. But I would be too if I had to work in a place that smelled like decomposing rats. Her hair is greasy, her makeup looks two days old, and her non-existent eyebrows are drawn on in crooked lines like she used a ruler while drunk. Her uniform needs to be washed—badly. God only knows what it's stained with.

""Coffee and blueberry pancakes,"" Vince says.

I glance at him and grimace. He ignores me and smiles at the waitress. She nods, scribbles down the order, and walks away.

""I didn't come all the way here for a dinner date,"" I say sharply. ""Tell me what you found so I can get going."" I tap my heel irritably against the floor and meet his eyes. I don't have time for this—I need to keep moving.

Vince nods and pulls a large envelope from his jacket.

""Right, uh, I found something you might be interested in,"" he begins.

I let out a heavy sigh.

""After opening your adoption file, I found out it was a closed adoption. But I managed to connect the time of your birth and your age to your birth mother. You were given away when you were about a year old. Since you came from a small town, it wasn't hard to figure out who your mother was.""

I glance up at him, then at the waitress who practically throws the plate of pancakes and coffee onto the table. This bimbo is seriously getting on my nerves. If she keeps this up, I might smash her face into the table.

I force myself to ignore the violent urge and look back at Vince.

""Right. Uh, your mother died five years ago of a dope overdose. But you have an older brother and a father. Your mother's name wa—""

""I don't care about her.""

Vince swallows hard, a bead of sweat rolling down his face.

""Right. Your father is fifty years old. His name is Damon Montague. Your brother is thirty—Steven Montague. They're both in an MC called the Highway Demons. Your brother is currently the president. Your father was president before him and the original founder of the club. All the information I found is in this file.""

He pushes the envelope toward me and waits for a reaction.

I stare out the window, taking in the quiet street and drawing a deep breath. Of course my family isn't normal. A biker club? Seriously?

I look back at Vince, the private investigator. After a moment, I reach inside my jacket and pull out another envelope—this one with $400 in cash. I set it on the table, and Vince immediately grabs it and starts counting, ignoring the nasty-looking pancakes in front of him.

I stand up, take the envelope with the files, and walk out.

The cement floor I'm lying on is cold. I shiver and try to ignore the black spots forming in my vision. My whole body hurts, and I let out a small whimper. The welts on my legs are infected, and pus is dripping from them. I know I need a doctor, but Sir only calls one when the wounds are life-threatening.

I hate Sir—my master, my torturer. The middle-aged man who brought me to this huge house when I was only five years old. Took me out of the overpopulated orphanage that was more than happy to let him take a child off their hands. He stole everything from me—my life, my freedom, my innocence—the moment I stepped foot into this house.

A child screams in the distance, and I try to detach myself from the sound. I know what's happening. I know it'll be my turn again soon, once I've healed a bit more. The screaming gets closer, the voice growing weaker until it turns into soft sobs. This girl must be new—she sounds young. I feel pity, but a darker part of me is relieved. Another person means more time for me to heal. More time alone. More time away from Sir.

The door opens, and I look up. The comforting darkness around me is disrupted by the faint light spilling in from the hallway. It stings my eyes, making me squint and groan. A guard enters, carrying a plate of the usual: cold, watered-down soup, hard bread, and a small cup of lukewarm water. He also sets down a bucket—for relieving myself.

I try to push myself up to reach the food, but I'm too weak. Another whimper rises in my throat, but I force it back down. I can't show weakness. I have to be hard. Detached. Cold.

The guard leans against the wall, arms folded over his bulky chest, smirking. He enjoys my pain. I can see it. I'm glad Sir makes it clear that no one else can touch his Dolls. Because I know that look in the guard's eyes. Lust. He wants me like Sir has me.

I cringe and crawl toward the plate. It takes forever, and by the time I reach it, I start eating straight from the bowl. I no longer feel ashamed to eat like an animal. I know what I am—nothing. Just a toy for Sir. I learned that quickly.

I've lost track of how long I've been here. I don't even know how old I am. I look down at my thin, broken body. Bruises, welts, and old scars cover my once porcelain skin. My bones press through my skin, and I barely have any breasts. But there's hair growing in places there wasn't before, so I must be a teenager by now—if what the older girls said in the orphanage was right.

I haven't seen the sky since I left the orphanage. Haven't felt the wind in my hair or the sun warming my skin since that day. I don't even remember what it feels like.

After I finish eating and drinking, the guard roughly shoves me aside and takes the plate. He leaves the bucket and shuts the door behind him. The sound of the lock clicking still breaks my heart. I want to cry, but I've already cried a lifetime's worth of tears. I'm completely empty.

––––––––––––

I open my eyes and throw the dirty blanket off my body. I'm sweating and breathing hard. Getting up, I glance at the cracked mirror hanging on the wall near the door. I look terrible. Sweat drips down my skin, my eyes are wide, and my shirt is ripped, my breasts fully exposed. Must've torn it while thrashing in my nightmare.

I rip the shirt off, toss it into the trash, and head into the dingy bathroom. A cockroach scuttles across the sink like it owns the place. maybe it does. Who knows anymore?

I step into the sorry excuse of a shower and scrub the terror of the dream off my skin. It's funny—how numb I am to everything now, yet still haunted by the past. Pathetic.

After the quick shower, I pull on a black string thong, my black leather pants, a gray tank top, my leather biker jacket, and combat boots. I've got a small B cup, so I don't wear a bra. They just make me uncomfortable.

I tie my dreadlocks into a low ponytail and look for my phone. 6:00 AM. Good. I've still got a three-hour drive ahead of me.

I pack my s\*\*t into my black leather backpack and grab my hunter knife and Glock. I don't go anywhere without them.

I tuck the knife into the hidden pocket I stitched inside my boot, pulling my jeans over it so it stays concealed. The Glock goes in the back of my pants. Then I walk outside.

I hate motels like this, but they're cheap—and no one asks questions.

I walk to my bike, load my gear into the duffel bags, and straddle the seat. With a smooth motion, I start it up and ride out, heading into the rising light. Three more hours to go.

Toward a small town in the middle of the Nevada desert.

Hard music fills the overcrowded, dimly lit clubhouse. My brothers are screwed up, like always—banging women on tables, getting blowjobs, having threesomes on the floor, and doing lines of coke. I sit at the bar, watching the chaos from a distance.

My Prez, Devil, sees me and takes the seat next to mine.

""Not joining again?"" he asks while nodding toward Linch, one of the Soul-Eaters, who's currently choking on David's manhood.

""no,"" I say, taking a huge gulp of my lukewarm beer.

""Another,"" I tell the bartender, Whiskey. The huge man lifts his chin and slides me a new bottle.

""You need to get over that nonsense, man. Nothing's better than the sweet feel of wet, tight vulva,"" Devil grins, wiggling his eyebrows.

""Don't concern yourself with my manhood,"" I reply. I'm tired of people telling me what to do. I hate women. I don't want them to touch me. I nearly killed one once when she tried to rub herself on me—and I really don't feel like doing that again. I don't hurt women unless they've harmed the club. I just don't want them near me. I don't want anyone touching me. I can barely handle my brothers, let alone some bimbo who's just hunting for a patched-in manhood.

""Whatever you say, man."" Devil gets up from his seat and grabs Linch by the hair. She likes being dominated, so she enjoys Devil dragging her toward a chair. It's obvious from her face—lust shines in her eyes, and she licks her thick, fake lips. I turn away just before Devil shoves his manhood into her still c\*m-filled mouth and finish my beer.

""Uh... hey.""

I turn and see a young woman. She must be new, because everyone in here knows not to come on to me. If I ever needed release, I'd grab a bimbo, put her on her knees, and get off right then and there. And even that doesn't happen often.

I'm a sick, aggressive piece of s\*\*t, and I know it. Apparently, this chick doesn't. She bites her bottom lip, trying to be seductive, and looks up at my six-foot-five frame. She steps closer, slowly. I let out a low growl.

""The heck do you want?""

Her eyes widen, but there's still lust in them. Crazy bimbo. She likes the danger I give off.

""You were sitting here alone, and I thought you could use some company,"" she says, trying her luck.

I know this type. She sees an opportunity because the others are too scared to get near me. She wants to be an old lady and thinks I'm a good candidate.

""I'll give you ten seconds,"" I say, looking down on her.

She smiles, stupidly thinking it's a good sign.

""Ten seconds to disappear before I break that little neck of yours.""

I'm only half bluffing. Devil would kill me if I hurt new blood. Well... he could try. I get blackouts. And when I do, I really don't care whether you're a woman or not.

The girl stumbles back, trips over her own foot, and lands hard on her hip. A few people around us snicker, laugh, or look a little worried. She scrambles up and half-walks, half-runs out of the clubhouse.

""AW, GIRL, YOU CAN COME TO ME—I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME!""

Rios, one of my brothers, shouts after her. The girl on his lap glares and pushes her fake boobs into his face, trying to win his attention back. Rios just laughs and smacks her hip.

I get up, fed up with this nonsense, and head for the stairs. The world spins, and I only now realize I'm more drunk than I thought. With a lot of effort, I make it to my room and stumble inside. I slam the door shut behind me, strip off my clothes, and toss them to the floor. Only my cut is neatly folded and placed on the closet.

My room is my safe haven, though it's small—just a bed, a tiny bathroom, and a closet. There are holes in the walls, stained with blood from one of my blackouts. I never bothered to clean that up. It's a warning to anyone who thinks about entering.

Nobody's allowed in here but Devil. I trust my brothers with my life, but I don't want them in my space. I sit on the bed with my back against the wall and close my eyes. I fall into a dark, dreamless sleep.

–––––––––––

As always, I wake up on the ground, facing the door. My back hurts, and I grunt as I get up. Stretching my arms over my head, I walk into the bathroom and take a cold shower.

Still undressed, I walk back into the room and dig around for some jeans and a shirt. Eventually, I find some that look clean and get dressed. Lastly, I throw on my cut and walk out the door.

The bar's already clean, and most of the Soul-Eaters are gone. The kitchen's filled with hungover brothers—and a grinning Rios. Prick never gets hangovers for some reason. I sit next to Devil and jerk my chin up at the others.

""Morning, VP,"" or ""Morning, Killer,"" they mumble. I grunt in response.

The kitchen is one of the biggest rooms in the clubhouse, with a long table that can seat around fifty people. Most of the brothers live here, so a big kitchen is necessary. It's the only room that's always clean since the Soul-Eaters basically live in here during the day. It's their job to clean up after our messes. We pay them with a small weekly allowance, a roof over their heads, and protection.

Bee Tessa, the club's promoted Soul-Eater, smiles at me and sets down a plate of toast and coffee before walking off. She knows which brothers like what when it comes to food—hence her promotion. She pays attention and keeps the others in line.

""We're having Church in two hours,"" Devil says, and we all nod. We've been having problems with some of the dope runs, so this was inevitable. Three runs raided in a short period—if we don't fix this, we're gonna have problems with a dope lord. None of us want that.

""HELLO!"" someone screams.

My brothers go quiet and turn toward the door. We abandon our food and rise, moving in that direction. Some of the guys look curious, others pissed that someone just walked into our clubhouse. One by one we move through the open doorway, until I nearly run into Rios, who stops abruptly.

""Fuuuuuuuck me,"" he mutters.

I look over his shoulder and have to agree. Yeah. F-k me sounds about right.

The chick standing in the middle of the bar is hot as sin. Too bad I don't want anything to do with her gender—because she would've been my type. Young, slender body, small boobs, nice little hip. Black and grey tattoos peek out from under her leather jacket. Her dark green and black dreads are tied in a high ponytail. She's tiny too—probably around five foot two. If I wanted to, I could snap her in two with one hand.

She looks around, completely unfazed by the thirty or so huge, jacked bikers surrounding her.

""I'm looking for a... Damon Montague,"" she says, checking a small slip of paper.

My eyebrows shoot up, and I glance at Devil, who's now glaring at the girl.

""What the heck you want with him?"" he growls.

His voice is threatening, but the girl couldn't care less.

""None of your business,"" she says, matching his tone.

Girl's got balls. Devil has a nasty rep—almost as bad as mine. His name wasn't given to him for fun. The methods he uses for killing or 'talking' aren't jokes.

""Trust me. It's my business,"" Devil says, stepping closer. Now they're nose to nose—well, as close as they can be. The girl barely reaches his shoulders.

""And how is that?"" she dares him, eyes cool.

""He's my old man,"" Devil says.

In the corner of my eye, I see Chaos—Devil's father. As usual, his face gives nothing away.

""Ah, that's fine then,"" she says. ""I'm Violet. Apparently... you're my older brother. Steven Montague?""

Problem is, last time i did this the soup burned my arms like crazy! Theres no lid for the bowls and the bowl is too tall for the tray's lid!

I figured a travel coffee cup would work to avoid this this time.

If anyone's in the park rn would you mind either asking a cm or checking the bottom of the bowl to see about the size of it? 

I tried asking a cm on the app and she guessed 32oz but that seems like wayy too much. I was guessing around 12oz myself.

1n02hl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jadegreen88/comments/1n02hl5/the_emporium/,The Emporium,"**MONDAY:** This was supposed to be my one day off. But when you have a skeleton crew, and someone doesn't show up, you get called to come in. Not by the manager or a coworker. You sort of just *know*. I can't explain it, like a lot of things around here. But somehow, you find yourself driving to work. So, here I am on the first day of what I just know is going to be a grueling seven-day stretch. 

I work at a small grocery store called The Emporium, located smack dab in the middle of town. Being centrally located, we see it all: the good, the bad, and everything in between. Anyone who works retail in any capacity will understand when I say, you experience the full spectrum of humanity here. 

The word '*emporium*' belongs to a dead language. And, you know, they *do* say Latin is often used in things like magic and witchcraft. But I don't know if that means anything. It'd make sense, though. I just honestly try not to question things around here too much. Doesn't do a lot of good, most of the time, anyway. 

I mainly stock shelves. But I can, and often do, pretty much everything around here. A lot of us have to be cross-trained just because of the high turnover rate. Usually, as soon as we hire a new person, they quit. Sometimes they don't even show up for the first shift after the interview. Probably what I should've done. Oh, well. Lucky them, I guess. 

Tonight, I'm closing with Paul. He's a pretty chill guy most of the time. Long-timer like me. He does have a few '*quirks*', but I'm used to it. Everyone here has at least one. Shit, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit weird, too—you kinda have to be to work here.

One of Paul's little quirks is his regularly scheduled freak-outs. Usually, right when it was time for him to have a smoke, a customer would ask him a question, and he'd lose it. Could be as simple and polite as '*Sir, which aisle is the bread on?*' Didn't matter. To Paul, it was infuriating. 

Sometimes he shows up already in a foul mood, and the very first customer of the night sets him off. Sure as shit, tonight just so happens to be one of his short fuse nights. Before I could even start loading my cart, Paul came slamming through the warehouse doors, dragging a limp body behind him. 

""God dammit, Paul. *Already?* I just clocked in!""

""Hey, man—don't fucking worry about it, alright? I got it."" 

""Whatever. Just make sure you shrink-wrap it good enough this time. The bailer still fucking stinks.""

I grabbed a mop and bucket, then went out onto the sales floor to see if there were any '*spills*' needing to be taken care of. Space Goth was shopping. We don't know her real name, so that's just what we call her. Honestly, the dark eye-makeup and shiny, black astronaut suit she made from trash bags are the least weird things about her. She had on a pair of fuzzy, leopard print earmuffs over her helmet this time and was singing '*Jingle Bells*' off-key at the top of her lungs. (It's the middle of June.) But hey, I only had to ask her to pull her suit back on just once, so that's progress.

Thankfully, Paul had been careful not to make a mess this time. So I rolled the mop bucket back to the janitor's closet and started loading my cart with backstock to fill. I counted out fifteen cases of bottled water that I needed for the shelf and stacked them up. Then, I walked over to the supply shelf to grab a pricing gun. (Yes, we have to price every single item in this damn store manually.) When I looked back at my cart, the water had turned into boxes of toilet paper. I could already tell it was going to be a long night.

At about 6:30 PM, The Hum began. It always starts coming through the intercom system around that time. No one can hear it except me. Drives me fucking nuts, so I take it as my nightly cue to go on break. 

That's what I'm doing right now as I write this on my phone. I forgot to bring dinner, and of course, there's no cell reception anywhere in this store, so I honestly don't have anything better to do. Might as well start documenting all the weird shit that goes on around here in my Notes app—could come in handy if I ever get deposed. 

At least when you work the night shift, one thing you don't have to deal with is The Earlybirds. You know the type. They show up about an hour before the store even opens. A whole fucking crowd of 'em, desperately clawing at the front doors, faces smashed up against the glass, just begging to be the first ones let in. 

That's why you *cannot* get caught outside before we open. The morning crew learned that the hard way. The Earlybirds got hold of one of them once. Pecked 'em clean down to the bone, too. Now the rest of the openers know to sneak in from the loading dock out back. I could've told them that if they had bothered to ask. Funny thing is, though, once 8 AM rolls around, you're safe. Fuckers just *poof*, up and disappear as soon as the damn door unlocks. 

The only cashier on duty tonight is Tilly. Which means I know I'm gonna be called up there to help out at some point. Tilly is slow as shit, but she can't really help it; she's super old. Also, it takes her forever to get through a sale because she's too worried about picking up all the rotting pieces of flesh that keep falling off of her. I keep telling her to just pick them all up at the end of the night, but she insists on keeping her register tidy, she says.

Lenny just walked into the break room, humming what sounds like some obscure hymn and holding his can of sardines. I don't even know why I bother coming in here—can't get a moment's worth of peace. Lenny's one of the many barnacles on the ass of this store. He's supposed to be in charge of cleaning and maintenance, but he does more of making a mess around here than anything else. The man is always dripping. It's like this black, rotten fish-smelling goop the fucker seems to sweat out constantly. 

Suddenly, Tilly's voice comes blaring out of the intercom speaker.

""Tom, you're needed at the registers!""

Here we go. At least it gives me an excuse to get up and leave without seeming rude. Not that Lenny even has the capacity for that level of social awareness. 

Tilly is swamped. Eight customers in her line, and she's literally falling apart. I hop on Register 2 and clear them all out within ten minutes. Then, I flip the register light off, look over, and see that Tilly's gone outside for a smoke. I swear, sometimes I think she's tearing extra pieces of her flesh off on purpose just to get out of working. 

I finish all the stocking I need to do by the time 9 PM arrives. Takes me three tries, but the water cases finally get filled. We're overstocked on toilet paper now, but that's not my problem. I walk over to the time clock and punch my number in, only to face the harsh words of:

*Employee Number 0164 is not currently clocked in. Would you like to clock in now?*

**TUESDAY:** I woke up early today, even though I didn't have to. My shift didn't start until 2 PM, but I wanted to enjoy whatever moments of freedom I had before returning to this place. I tell you, The Emporium will drain the life right outta ya, if you let it.

But I'm here now. Definitely clocked in this time, too. No one believes me when I tell them that time clock is a fucking thief. It's been deleting hours off of my time lately. Sometimes, it takes the whole damn shift. Guess I'm the only one it does that to, of course. Bastard.

Chris is here working with me tonight. He's a fairly normal guy, I'd say. Except, the motherfucker does have more fingers than usual. A whole extra hand, in fact, and it's not where you'd expect it to be. Always gets him in trouble. 

The Turd Slug is back again. It's fucking disgusting, but we can't really do anything about it. The more we chase it around, the more shit it smears everywhere. And Lenny does a God-awful job of cleaning it up, of course. It's honestly better to just pretend like you don't even see it.

I'm expecting it to be a pretty slow night, the kind that just drags on forever. I don't have a lot of backstock to do, so I decide to go and try to clean up The Spill That Never Dries. I know it's a huge waste of time, and tonight, that's my goal. I call it '*do nothing Tuesdays*' because it's supposed to be my first day back. But since I didn't get my day off yesterday, I'll have to work extra hard to do more nothing than usual tonight.  

I go over to the janitor's closet, and, of course, Lenny's in there, dripping. *Ugh*, I hate it when he stands in my way; it's really hard to get all the goop off the bottom of my shoes. Shit has the consistency of tar and smells even worse. I reach past him and grab the mop and bucket, then head over to aisle 13. 

When I get there, Blind Richard is flailing around on the ground, covered in green slime and holding onto a box of saltines. *Christ*, must've slipped on The Spill. Now I have to fill out a God damned accident report. And let me just say for the record: that motherfucker is *not* really blind—he's faking it. I just know. 

I bend over to help him up, and suddenly, a finger slides into a place I was not expecting. 

""God damnit! Chris!!""

""Oh, jeez—I'm sorry, man! I was just trying to help."" 

""Just... back up, okay? I got it. If you want to help, go and grab an accident form from the office for me,"" I say, trying not to lose my cool. 

""Okay! Where's the office?""

Chris has worked here for at least five years. He's been in that office many, many times. I explain to him *again* how to get there, then turn around to help Blind Richard. Only, he's gone. That shithead got up and walked away on his own, smearing The Spill all over the place with his stick. At least now I don't have to fill out the form—corporate mandates that you sign it in blood and I've already given them enough.  

I decide to give up on The Spill and head back to the warehouse. Maybe I'll just hide out there until I hear The Hum. Adam is the one running the register tonight. That means I won't have to go up there and help unless he has one of his '*episodes*.' 

Every so often, Adam gets these little fits where it's like something suddenly comes over him. His eyes turn black, his head spins around, and he starts projectile vomiting all over the customers. I think the fucker needs to be on medicine or something. But he doesn't think anything's wrong with him, because he never remembers it happening. Real convenient if you ask me.

I walk through the warehouse doors and I can already smell it. The Fart Cloud. It must be somewhere around back here. And I know it isn't the Turd Slug because I just saw the little shit over by the milk coolers and it's not that fast. The Fart Cloud is, of course, invisible. And it never dissipates, it just moves. You pretty much never know where it's going to be until you crop-dust yourself with it. 

Usually I have protection, but I forgot to bring my jacket with me tonight. Which also means I'm freezing my ass off. *God*, it's always so fucking cold in here. I used to go around setting all the thermostats to 72 degrees, but someone kept going behind me and turning them down to 65, so I don't even bother with it anymore. Besides, the cold air probably keeps the smells from festering too much. At least I remembered to bring my food. 

The Hum just started up, so I'm making my way to the break room. *Fuck*. Yogurt Lady's here, over by the coolers. She hasn't started slathering herself yet, but I know she'll still growl if she sees me. I have to pass by her to get to my food, and I don't feel like being attacked tonight. Guess I'm not eating. 

After that, things were pretty uneventful, for a while at least. I'm currently spending the rest of my shift trying to fill cans of soup. They keep changing into mice every time I put one of them on the shelf. I'm not even going to bother with trying to catch any of them. Maybe they'll eat The Turd Slug.

It's a quarter to 9, and Chris comes running up to me, holding a piece of paper and screaming, 

""I got it!"" 

It's the accident form. I forgot I even sent him on that mission. 

""Thanks, Chris. Now go put it back in the office for me.""

""Okay! Where's the office?"" 

I head up to the front of the store, and apparently, Adam had an episode that no one alerted me to. The openers will be pissed, but I don't care. I am *not* cleaning up all this. Besides, they'll just blame it on Lenny. 

As I approach the time clock, eager to get home and be done with this night, I hear a squish. I lift my foot, and it's the fucking Turd Slug feasting on a half-eaten mouse. I kick it across the floor and punch my numbers in. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

**WEDNESDAY:** Today is the day our manager, Gerold, comes in to check on us all. He's supposed to be here every day during the week, but I don't think his sleep cycle allows for that. Instead, on Wednesdays, he gets here first thing in the morning and stays until closing time. Oh, and he watches us the whole time. Seriously, the man doesn't blink. Ever. 

I made sure to get here on time and start loading my cart up right away. No fucking around today. You know, it really pisses me off that Gerold even pretends to care. We all know he's too worried about fucking Ruby behind corporate's back. And she's the one in charge of the bookkeeping around here—imagine that. Shady as shit, if you ask me. If I knew the number, I'd call corporate myself and give them an earful. Though I get the feeling they're always listening anyway. 

Gerold and Ruby aren't exactly good at hiding their little affair, either. The whole store found out about it right away. A few months back, Adam walked in on them during one of their '*meetings*' in the office. When he ran and got me, he was having a complete meltdown, crying about how he saw the two of them become '*one flesh*'. 

I thought that was just his weird way of saying it, and hurried over to take a peek. Turned out the dude wasn't joking. Their skin had literally fused together from the hips all the way up to their heads. Took forever to get them apart with just my box cutter. Come to think of it, that's right around the time Adam's '*episodes*' started. Hmm.

I begin the task of chasing around the loaves of bread and trying desperately to get them back into their boxes, when suddenly, I feel a pair of eyes on me. I turn around and, of course, it's Gerold, peeking at me from behind a pallet of paper towels. 

""I see you, Gerold. I'm trying my best, but they keep running off.""

He leans his head back, hisses at me, and a few cockroaches take their chance to escape from his mouth before his jaws slam back shut, crunching the last one in the process. I give him the thumbs up and get back to it—no use trying to argue with him. 

I finally make it out to the sales floor with my cart, and the first customer I encounter is Crazy Mary. She's got a half-eaten sandwich knotted up in her hair, a tire track across her face, and she's being followed by a raccoon that looks pissed. I swear, whoever keeps summoning her by saying her name in the mirror three times needs to cut that shit out. 

""How are you doing tonight, Mary?"" 

""Wonderful!""

""Finding everything you need?"" 

""Oh, yes... just found it.

A huge toothless grin creeps across her face as she extends an empty specimen cup out toward me. *Fucking great*. Now she's gonna follow me around until I give her some of my pee. Might as well get it over with. 

Paul was scheduled to work tonight, but he called the store and said he couldn't make it in. Honestly, thank God. I don't need any extra bullshit to worry about. The dude had a stupid reason, though. Something about being trapped in a time loop, and that he couldn't get out. *Shit*, aren't we all?

Emma showed up instead; must've got the call. She's one of the newer ones here, but she's catching on quickly. Sweet girl. Strange taste in men, though. Started dating Chris a week after she was hired. *Loves* the hand—maybe a little too much. That's why we can't schedule them working the same shift alone. Also, I'm not trying to place any blame here, but I did notice the hand had one less finger on it last night. Do with that what you will. 

I get to the front of the store to stock the bread that hadn't gotten away yet and notice Ruby lingering near the registers. Of course, she's '*working late*' today. She looks over at me and tries to wink, but one of her fake eyelashes falls off, along with the eyeball it's attached to. I pull out my box cutter and show it to her. She flips me off, then gets on the intercom and says,

""Gerold, you're needed in the office!""

*Fucking gross*. Whatever, at least I don't have to deal with the Turd Slug tonight. It somehow knows when Gerold's here and stays hidden. And, maybe if I offer to buy Lenny his can of sardines, he'll help me separate the '*one flesh*' later. Besides, I know he's been looking for a reason to use that new machete—he won't shut up about it. 

Emma wants to learn everything she can around here, which is great, but she can be a little intense sometimes. She's watching me stock the bread very closely, even though it's a fairly intuitive process. You just slap a price sticker on a loaf and plop it onto the shelf before it runs off. Easy peasy. What it does after you stock it, well, that's not your problem. 

I'm starting to think she's actually staring at my fingers, though, because now she's drooling. I tell her I don't have any extras to spare, but she wipes her mouth and says she has no idea what I'm talking about. *Right.*

On the way back to the bailer, I pass The Man Who Walks In Circles. I'm feeling a little frisky tonight, so I look around to make sure Gerold isn't watching, then throw an empty box in his path to see if I can make him stop this time. He doesn't. Just keeps on walking in that circle, eyes fixed on me, wearing a smile on his face, and the box as a shoe. Nothing ever changes around here. 

When I get to the bailer and start throwing my boxes in, I hear an odd thud, then a scratchy-throated groan. I roll my eyes and lean forward to look inside. It's Tilly, spooning with the compacted, shrink-wrapped corpse from Monday. For Christ's sake, I didn't even know she was working tonight—I could've bailed her! She glares up at me and tells me she's just '*having a nap*' and that I was very rude for disturbing her. 

Lucky for me, I dodge The Fart Cloud on the way out of the warehouse. It caught Emma instead. I look over and she's gagging while trying to fill her cart with the cases of soda/lobsters. I grab the one crawling near my foot and throw it into the bailer with Tilly and her new boyfriend, then wait for the scream before I run out. 

I decide to head over to the break room before The Hum even starts up. I packed myself a delicious turkey sandwich for tonight, and I'm fucking starving. I'm pleased to find Lenny isn't in here yet, so my plan is to hurry and scarf down my dinner before he shows up. 

I pull out my sandwich, take a huge bite, and instantly feel it start to squirm around in my mouth. I look down, and instead of turkey, it's maggots. *Fuck*. I spit the bite out onto the floor, and it crawls away. Lenny walks in, steps on it, and then proceeds to tell me how gross I am. 

He and I are spending the rest of the night separating the '*one flesh.*' Gerold tells us that if we aren't more careful about it this time, we'll be fired. We don't care about losing our jobs—a new incinerator got installed last week, so he means that literally. Emma wants to help, too, of course. But, once again, I'm convinced she has ulterior motives. By the end of the whole ordeal, I'm proven right. Ruby is missing the tip of one of her pinkies. 

Finally, it's time to clock out. I slap one of Gerold's mouth roaches out of my hair, wipe the Lenny goo off my shoes, and make my way to the front. Tilly stops me and asks if I could carry the rotting corpse to her car for her, so I do that first just to get rid of it. I'm sure they'll be very happy together; they seem to have a lot in common. 

I come back inside, walk up to the time clock, and then breathe a sigh of relief. It's over—I made it to the end of the night. I reach my arm out toward the keypad, but just before I can punch my number in, I get blasted in the face by The Fart Cloud. *Shit*, can this week get any worse?

**THURSDAY:** Today is truck delivery day at The Emporium. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded, priced, and put out, so all of us night shift stockers are required to be here; no exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work pricing and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. Their official title is morning shift leaders, but the rest of us just call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they couldn't give two shits about what's going on around here. But on truck day? *Sheesh*. They'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Usually, by the time I get here, they're more than halfway through it all. But apparently, today the truck got here late, so it looks like I'll be busy until closing. Fine by me. I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today. Almost *excited* to be at work.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple of hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as possible. We start with the refrigerated and frozen items since they usually '*spoil*' first. Yogurt Lady's already here waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I load Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area and send her off. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy, who's wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday. Old man just can't keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night, though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy,"" I say, kicking his shoulder.

He just starts flailing even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot and pass with my cart. I load up all the milk, Chris takes the eggs, and Paul gets stuck with the frozen items. He's pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the walk-in freezer is so hard to stock is because he was using it as a body storage until it got too full. He made that mess; he can fucking deal with it.

I finish putting away everything on my cart, then look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's dripping in egg juice and fighting his extra hand, trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh—he just glares at me in defeat. I feel bad, so I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey! Thanks, man!!"" 

Usually, I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma, snacking on a yogurt-covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a cleanup. I put the receiver up to my ear, and it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But honestly, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over ten minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By now, the floor is covered with a slurry of raw egg-yogurt soup, and The Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished—we don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh*, maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8 AM, because I notice there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the morning crew gets together and selects one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. They say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think it's really because they're all sadistic. Or just bored. Thank God they're about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just scuttled in. I'm not even going to bother with chasing him this time. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's actually the opposite. The bag's full when he walks in and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter—I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" he says.  

I reach into my bag and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from my non-break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out here. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand, who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen (of course), and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand have been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out an accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, and then go looking for Paul. I find him in the freezer; he must've tripped over one of the dead bodies and knocked himself unconscious. *Fucking idiot*. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. On the way, I pass down aisle 13. The Spill That Never Dries is growing. It's eaten the Wet Floor sign that was next to it, just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though I know it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud: the coast is clear. I punched my number in, and I'm pleased to find the time clock hasn't stolen any of my hours today. I smile triumphantly and turn around. 

There's Paul, shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douchebag. I sigh. *Christ*, I just hope the rest of this week goes by fast. Maybe I'll call in sick tomorrow.

1n02h2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdminAssistant/comments/1n02h2p/only_7_weeks_into_my_first_postgrad_job_and_i/,Only 7 weeks into my first post-grad job and I already feel like the “Office Cinderella”,"So, I just need to vent. I graduated college about three months ago and started my first full-time job as an admin assistant seven weeks ago. I knew it wouldn’t be glamorous, but today just broke me a little.

When I applied, the job description talked about report preparation, clerical work, general admin tasks. I thought it would be a solid entry-level position where I could get some office experience, start from the bottom, and work my way up. I was realistic, I knew I’d be doing “grunt work” at first.

But what I didn’t expect was all the extra stuff that’s been piled on me that was never in the job description. Like restocking the coffee station, creamers, cups. People literally walk up to me to complain that their favorite creamer is out (even though the extras are literally in the drawer right below). I also found out only after I accepted that my desk would be the front desk, meaning I basically function as the receptionist, even though that’s not my title. I wanted to be doing more clerical/analytical work, but instead I’m stuck doing receptionist tasks with the “admin assistant” title slapped on top.

And people keep calling me a receptionist. Usually I’ll politely correct them, like “actually I’m the admin assistant,” but it feels so minimizing. The worst was today when someone from HR (the department I’d love to work in one day, btw) introduced me to a new employee as “just our receptionist.” Like, ouch. That one stung.

On top of that, there are random expectations that were never mentioned. Today I was told it’s on me to deliver everyone’s packages to their rooms, including heavy 50 lb boxes. Sure, I have a cart, but still… that’s a mailroom/delivery job, not what I signed up for. And then last week my manager talked to me because I didn’t empty one of the tiny coffee station trash bins (apparently that’s now my responsibility too?).

It feels degrading. I know I’m young and fresh out of school, and I know I have to start somewhere. I’m not expecting to jump straight into HR or finance at 22. But it’s really hard not to feel like “the receptionist girl who sits at the front to look pretty and deal with coffee and UPS packages.” There was a girl in this role before me who apparently went above and beyond with all this extra stuff, and now they expect me to do the same. But I just feel like Cinderella running around cleaning up after everyone.

I’ve even told my managers that I’d love to help out with HR tasks or projects in other departments, and they always say, “We’ll let you know,” but they’re too busy and never actually follow through. I get that I probably have to “prove myself” first by being amazing at my current role, but honestly, a lot of what I’m being judged on feels like dumb little things, like closing blinds, cleaning counters, stocking coffee, and taking out trash. It’s exhausting when I literally have a degree in business and know I’m capable of more.

This is also a really reputable company, and I’m ambitious, I want to be seen as someone they can trust with more responsibility. But right now, my day-to-day feels like busywork, and I feel underutilized. I know there are people who love being in supportive roles, and I respect that, but it’s not what I expected for myself.

I want to stay at least 1–2 years before moving on, but I honestly don’t know how I’ll last if every day feels like this. Does it get better? Has anyone been in a similar spot? How do I prove myself so people stop seeing me as “just the receptionist” and start seeing me as someone capable of more? I don’t want to be impatient, but I feel stuck and I’m at a loss. I’m trying to see the positives, like how being at the front means most people will know me and I will get to know a lot of people in the company and other departments. And I keep telling myself, if they need a coffee restocker, then I will be the best damn coffee restocker they’ve ever had to help boost my career. But it’s hard when it’s just mundane tasks every day for 8-9 hours.

1n02eyc,https://i.redd.it/z2xptnzib8lf1.jpeg,The Emporium: Based on a True Story (Part One),"*Names of individuals involved have been changed to protect their privacy.*

**MONDAY:** This was supposed to be my one day off. But when you have a skeleton crew, and someone doesn't show up, you get called to come in. Not by the manager or a coworker. You sort of just *know*. I can't explain it, like a lot of things around here. But somehow, you find yourself driving to work. So, here I am on the first day of what I just know is going to be a grueling seven-day stretch. 

I work at a small grocery store called The Emporium, located smack dab in the middle of town. Being centrally located, we see it all: the good, the bad, and everything in between. Anyone who works retail in any capacity will understand when I say, you experience the full spectrum of humanity here. 

The word '*emporium*' belongs to a dead language. And, you know, they *do* say Latin is often used in things like magic and witchcraft. But I don't know if that means anything. It'd make sense, though. I just honestly try not to question things around here too much. Doesn't do a lot of good, most of the time, anyway. 

I mainly stock shelves. But I can, and often do, pretty much everything around here. A lot of us have to be cross-trained just because of the high turnover rate. Usually, as soon as we hire a new person, they quit. Sometimes they don't even show up for the first shift after the interview. Probably what I should've done. Oh, well. Lucky them, I guess. 

Tonight, I'm closing with Paul. He's a pretty chill guy most of the time. Long-timer like me. He does have a few '*quirks*', but I'm used to it. Everyone here has at least one. Shit, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit weird, too—you kinda have to be to work here.

One of Paul's little quirks is his regularly scheduled freak-outs. Usually, right when it was time for him to have a smoke, a customer would ask him a question, and he'd lose it. Could be as simple and polite as '*Sir, which aisle is the bread on?*' Didn't matter. To Paul, it was infuriating. 

Sometimes he shows up already in a foul mood, and the very first customer of the night sets him off. Sure as shit, tonight just so happens to be one of his short fuse nights. Before I could even start loading my cart, Paul came slamming through the warehouse doors, dragging a limp body behind him. 

""God dammit, Paul. *Already?* I just clocked in!""

""Hey, man—don't fucking worry about it, alright? I got it."" 

""Whatever. Just make sure you shrink-wrap it good enough this time. The bailer still fucking stinks.""

I grabbed a mop and bucket, then went out onto the sales floor to see if there were any '*spills*' needing to be taken care of. Space Goth was shopping. We don't know her real name, so that's just what we call her. Honestly, the dark eye-makeup and shiny, black astronaut suit she made from trash bags are the least weird things about her. She had on a pair of fuzzy, leopard print earmuffs over her helmet this time and was singing '*Jingle Bells*' off-key at the top of her lungs. (It's the middle of June.) But hey, I only had to ask her to pull her suit back on just once, so that's progress.

Thankfully, Paul had been careful not to make a mess this time. So I rolled the mop bucket back to the janitor's closet and started loading my cart with backstock to fill. I counted out fifteen cases of bottled water that I needed for the shelf and stacked them up. Then, I walked over to the supply shelf to grab a pricing gun. (Yes, we have to price every single item in this damn store manually.) When I looked back at my cart, the water had turned into boxes of toilet paper. I could already tell it was going to be a long night.

At about 6:30 PM, The Hum began. It always starts coming through the intercom system around that time. No one can hear it except me. Drives me fucking nuts, so I take it as my nightly cue to go on break. 

That's what I'm doing right now as I write this on my phone. I forgot to bring dinner, and of course, there's no cell reception anywhere in this store, so I honestly don't have anything better to do. Might as well start documenting all the weird shit that goes on around here in my Notes app—could come in handy if I ever get deposed. 

At least when you work the night shift, one thing you don't have to deal with is The Earlybirds. You know the type. They show up about an hour before the store even opens. A whole fucking crowd of 'em, desperately clawing at the front doors, faces smashed up against the glass, just begging to be the first ones let in. 

That's why you *cannot* get caught outside before we open. The morning crew learned that the hard way. The Earlybirds got hold of one of them once. Pecked 'em clean down to the bone, too. Now the rest of the openers know to sneak in from the loading dock out back. I could've told them that if they had bothered to ask. Funny thing is, though, once 8 AM rolls around, you're safe. Fuckers just *poof*, up and disappear as soon as the damn door unlocks. 

The only cashier on duty tonight is Tilly. Which means I know I'm gonna be called up there to help out at some point. Tilly is slow as shit, but she can't really help it; she's super old. Also, it takes her forever to get through a sale because she's too worried about picking up all the rotting pieces of flesh that keep falling off of her. I keep telling her to just pick them all up at the end of the night, but she insists on keeping her register tidy, she says.

Lenny just walked into the break room, humming what sounds like some obscure hymn and holding his can of sardines. I don't even know why I bother coming in here—can't get a moment's worth of peace. Lenny's one of the many barnacles on the ass of this store. He's supposed to be in charge of cleaning and maintenance, but he does more of making a mess around here than anything else. The man is always dripping. It's like this black, rotten fish-smelling goop the fucker seems to sweat out constantly. 

Suddenly, Tilly's voice comes blaring out of the intercom speaker.

""Tom, you're needed at the registers!""

Here we go. At least it gives me an excuse to get up and leave without seeming rude. Not that Lenny even has the capacity for that level of social awareness. 

Tilly is swamped. Eight customers in her line, and she's literally falling apart. I hop on Register 2 and clear them all out within ten minutes. Then, I flip the register light off, look over, and see that Tilly's gone outside for a smoke. I swear, sometimes I think she's tearing extra pieces of her flesh off on purpose just to get out of working. 

I finish all the stocking I need to do by the time 9 PM arrives. Takes me three tries, but the water cases finally get filled. We're overstocked on toilet paper now, but that's not my problem. I walk over to the time clock and punch my number in, only to face the harsh words of:

*Employee Number 0164 is not currently clocked in. Would you like to clock in now?*

**TUESDAY:** I woke up early today, even though I didn't have to. My shift didn't start until 2 PM, but I wanted to enjoy whatever moments of freedom I had before returning to this place. I tell you, The Emporium will drain the life right outta ya, if you let it.

But I'm here now. Definitely clocked in this time, too. No one believes me when I tell them that time clock is a fucking thief. It's been deleting hours off of my time lately. Sometimes, it takes the whole damn shift. Guess I'm the only one it does that to, of course. Bastard.

Chris is here working with me tonight. He's a fairly normal guy, I'd say. Except, the motherfucker does have more fingers than usual. A whole extra hand, in fact, and it's not where you'd expect it to be. Always gets him in trouble. 

The Turd Slug is back again. It's fucking disgusting, but we can't really do anything about it. The more we chase it around, the more shit it smears everywhere. And Lenny does a God-awful job of cleaning it up, of course. It's honestly better to just pretend like you don't even see it.

I'm expecting it to be a pretty slow night, the kind that just drags on forever. I don't have a lot of backstock to do, so I decide to go and try to clean up The Spill That Never Dries. I know it's a huge waste of time, and tonight, that's my goal. I call it '*do nothing Tuesdays*' because it's supposed to be my first day back. But since I didn't get my day off yesterday, I'll have to work extra hard to do more nothing than usual tonight.  

I go over to the janitor's closet, and, of course, Lenny's in there, dripping. *Ugh*, I hate it when he stands in my way; it's really hard to get all the goop off the bottom of my shoes. Shit has the consistency of tar and smells even worse. I reach past him and grab the mop and bucket, then head over to aisle 13. 

When I get there, Blind Richard is flailing around on the ground, covered in green slime and holding onto a box of saltines. *Christ*, must've slipped on The Spill. Now I have to fill out a God damned accident report. And let me just say for the record: that motherfucker is *not* really blind—he's faking it. I just know. 

I bend over to help him up, and suddenly, a finger slides into a place I was not expecting. 

""God damnit! Chris!!""

""Oh, jeez—I'm sorry, man! I was just trying to help."" 

""Just... back up, okay? I got it. If you want to help, go and grab an accident form from the office for me,"" I say, trying not to lose my cool. 

""Okay! Where's the office?""

Chris has worked here for at least five years. He's been in that office many, many times. I explain to him *again* how to get there, then turn around to help Blind Richard. Only, he's gone. That shithead got up and walked away on his own, smearing The Spill all over the place with his stick. At least now I don't have to fill out the form—corporate mandates that you sign it in blood and I've already given them enough.  

I decide to give up on The Spill and head back to the warehouse. Maybe I'll just hide out there until I hear The Hum. Adam is the one running the register tonight. That means I won't have to go up there and help unless he has one of his '*episodes*.' 

Every so often, Adam gets these little fits where it's like something suddenly comes over him. His eyes turn black, his head spins around, and he starts projectile vomiting all over the customers. I think the fucker needs to be on medicine or something. But he doesn't think anything's wrong with him, because he never remembers it happening. Real convenient if you ask me.

I walk through the warehouse doors and I can already smell it. The Fart Cloud. It must be somewhere around back here. And I know it isn't the Turd Slug because I just saw the little shit over by the milk coolers and it's not that fast. The Fart Cloud is, of course, invisible. And it never dissipates, it just moves. You pretty much never know where it's going to be until you crop-dust yourself with it. 

Usually I have protection, but I forgot to bring my jacket with me tonight. Which also means I'm freezing my ass off. *God*, it's always so fucking cold in here. I used to go around setting all the thermostats to 72 degrees, but someone kept going behind me and turning them down to 65, so I don't even bother with it anymore. Besides, the cold air probably keeps the smells from festering too much. At least I remembered to bring my food. 

The Hum just started up, so I'm making my way to the break room. *Fuck*. Yogurt Lady's here, over by the coolers. She hasn't started slathering herself yet, but I know she'll still growl if she sees me. I have to pass by her to get to my food, and I don't feel like being attacked tonight. Guess I'm not eating. 

After that, things were pretty uneventful, for a while at least. I'm currently spending the rest of my shift trying to fill cans of soup. They keep changing into mice every time I put one of them on the shelf. I'm not even going to bother with trying to catch any of them. Maybe they'll eat The Turd Slug.

It's a quarter to 9, and Chris comes running up to me, holding a piece of paper and screaming, 

""I got it!"" 

It's the accident form. I forgot I even sent him on that mission. 

""Thanks, Chris. Now go put it back in the office for me.""

""Okay! Where's the office?"" 

I head up to the front of the store, and apparently, Adam had an episode that no one alerted me to. The openers will be pissed, but I don't care. I am *not* cleaning up all this. Besides, they'll just blame it on Lenny. 

As I approach the time clock, eager to get home and be done with this night, I hear a squish. I lift my foot, and it's the fucking Turd Slug feasting on a half-eaten mouse. I kick it across the floor and punch my numbers in. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

**WEDNESDAY:** Today is the day our manager, Gerold, comes in to check on us all. He's supposed to be here every day during the week, but I don't think his sleep cycle allows for that. Instead, on Wednesdays, he gets here first thing in the morning and stays until closing time. Oh, and he watches us the whole time. Seriously, the man doesn't blink. Ever. 

I made sure to get here on time and start loading my cart up right away. No fucking around today. You know, it really pisses me off that Gerold even pretends to care. We all know he's too worried about fucking Ruby behind corporate's back. And she's the one in charge of the bookkeeping around here—imagine that. Shady as shit, if you ask me. If I knew the number, I'd call corporate myself and give them an earful. Though I get the feeling they're always listening anyway. 

Gerold and Ruby aren't exactly good at hiding their little affair, either. The whole store found out about it right away. A few months back, Adam walked in on them during one of their '*meetings*' in the office. When he ran and got me, he was having a complete meltdown, crying about how he saw the two of them become '*one flesh*'. 

I thought that was just his weird way of saying it, and hurried over to take a peek. Turned out the dude wasn't joking. Their skin had literally fused together from the hips all the way up to their heads. Took forever to get them apart with just my box cutter. Come to think of it, that's right around the time Adam's '*episodes*' started. Hmm.

I begin the task of chasing around the loaves of bread and trying desperately to get them back into their boxes, when suddenly, I feel a pair of eyes on me. I turn around and, of course, it's Gerold, peeking at me from behind a pallet of paper towels. 

""I see you, Gerold. I'm trying my best, but they keep running off.""

He leans his head back, hisses at me, and a few cockroaches take their chance to escape from his mouth before his jaws slam back shut, crunching the last one in the process. I give him the thumbs up and get back to it—no use trying to argue with him. 

I finally make it out to the sales floor with my cart, and the first customer I encounter is Crazy Mary. She's got a half-eaten sandwich knotted up in her hair, a tire track across her face, and she's being followed by a raccoon that looks pissed. I swear, whoever keeps summoning her by saying her name in the mirror three times needs to cut that shit out. 

""How are you doing tonight, Mary?"" 

""Wonderful!""

""Finding everything you need?"" 

""Oh, yes... just found it.

A huge toothless grin creeps across her face as she extends an empty specimen cup out toward me. *Fucking great*. Now she's gonna follow me around until I give her some of my pee. Might as well get it over with. 

Paul was scheduled to work tonight, but he called the store and said he couldn't make it in. Honestly, thank God. I don't need any extra bullshit to worry about. The dude had a stupid reason, though. Something about being trapped in a time loop, and that he couldn't get out. *Shit*, aren't we all?

Emma showed up instead; must've got the call. She's one of the newer ones here, but she's catching on quickly. Sweet girl. Strange taste in men, though. Started dating Chris a week after she was hired. *Loves* the hand—maybe a little too much. That's why we can't schedule them working the same shift alone. Also, I'm not trying to place any blame here, but I did notice the hand had one less finger on it last night. Do with that what you will. 

I get to the front of the store to stock the bread that hadn't gotten away yet and notice Ruby lingering near the registers. Of course, she's '*working late*' today. She looks over at me and tries to wink, but one of her fake eyelashes falls off, along with the eyeball it's attached to. I pull out my box cutter and show it to her. She flips me off, then gets on the intercom and says,

""Gerold, you're needed in the office!""

*Fucking gross*. Whatever, at least I don't have to deal with the Turd Slug tonight. It somehow knows when Gerold's here and stays hidden. And, maybe if I offer to buy Lenny his can of sardines, he'll help me separate the '*one flesh*' later. Besides, I know he's been looking for a reason to use that new machete—he won't shut up about it. 

Emma wants to learn everything she can around here, which is great, but she can be a little intense sometimes. She's watching me stock the bread very closely, even though it's a fairly intuitive process. You just slap a price sticker on a loaf and plop it onto the shelf before it runs off. Easy peasy. What it does after you stock it, well, that's not your problem. 

I'm starting to think she's actually staring at my fingers, though, because now she's drooling. I tell her I don't have any extras to spare, but she wipes her mouth and says she has no idea what I'm talking about. *Right.*

On the way back to the bailer, I pass The Man Who Walks In Circles. I'm feeling a little frisky tonight, so I look around to make sure Gerold isn't watching, then throw an empty box in his path to see if I can make him stop this time. He doesn't. Just keeps on walking in that circle, eyes fixed on me, wearing a smile on his face, and the box as a shoe. Nothing ever changes around here. 

When I get to the bailer and start throwing my boxes in, I hear an odd thud, then a scratchy-throated groan. I roll my eyes and lean forward to look inside. It's Tilly, spooning with the compacted, shrink-wrapped corpse from Monday. For Christ's sake, I didn't even know she was working tonight—I could've bailed her! She glares up at me and tells me she's just '*having a nap*' and that I was very rude for disturbing her. 

Lucky for me, I dodge The Fart Cloud on the way out of the warehouse. It caught Emma instead. I look over and she's gagging while trying to fill her cart with the cases of soda/lobsters. I grab the one crawling near my foot and throw it into the bailer with Tilly and her new boyfriend, then wait for the scream before I run out. 

I decide to head over to the break room before The Hum even starts up. I packed myself a delicious turkey sandwich for tonight, and I'm fucking starving. I'm pleased to find Lenny isn't in here yet, so my plan is to hurry and scarf down my dinner before he shows up. 

I pull out my sandwich, take a huge bite, and instantly feel it start to squirm around in my mouth. I look down, and instead of turkey, it's maggots. *Fuck*. I spit the bite out onto the floor, and it crawls away. Lenny walks in, steps on it, and then proceeds to tell me how gross I am. 

He and I are spending the rest of the night separating the '*one flesh.*' Gerold tells us that if we aren't more careful about it this time, we'll be fired. We don't care about losing our jobs—a new incinerator got installed last week, so he means that literally. Emma wants to help, too, of course. But, once again, I'm convinced she has ulterior motives. By the end of the whole ordeal, I'm proven right. Ruby is missing the tip of one of her pinkies. 

Finally, it's time to clock out. I slap one of Gerold's mouth roaches out of my hair, wipe the Lenny goo off my shoes, and make my way to the front. Tilly stops me and asks if I could carry the rotting corpse to her car for her, so I do that first just to get rid of it. I'm sure they'll be very happy together; they seem to have a lot in common. 

I come back inside, walk up to the time clock, and then breathe a sigh of relief. It's over—I made it to the end of the night. I reach my arm out toward the keypad, but just before I can punch my number in, I get blasted in the face by The Fart Cloud. *Shit*, can this week get any worse?

**THURSDAY:** Today is truck delivery day at The Emporium. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded, priced, and put out, so all of us night shift stockers are required to be here; no exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work pricing and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. Their official title is morning shift leaders, but the rest of us just call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they couldn't give two shits about what's going on around here. But on truck day? *Sheesh*. They'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Usually, by the time I get here, they're more than halfway through it all. But apparently, today the truck got here late, so it looks like I'll be busy until closing. Fine by me. I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today. Almost *excited* to be at work.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple of hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as possible. We start with the refrigerated and frozen items since they usually '*spoil*' first. Yogurt Lady's already here waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I load Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area and send her off. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy, who's wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday. Old man just can't keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night, though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy,"" I say, kicking his shoulder.

He just starts flailing even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot and pass with my cart. I load up all the milk, Chris takes the eggs, and Paul gets stuck with the frozen items. He's pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the walk-in freezer is so hard to stock is because he was using it as a body storage until it got too full. He made that mess; he can fucking deal with it.

I finish putting away everything on my cart, then look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's dripping in egg juice and fighting his extra hand, trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh—he just glares at me in defeat. I feel bad, so I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey! Thanks, man!!"" 

Usually, I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma, snacking on a yogurt-covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a cleanup. I put the receiver up to my ear, and it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But honestly, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over ten minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By now, the floor is covered with a slurry of raw egg-yogurt soup, and The Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished—we don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh*, maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8 AM, because I notice there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the morning crew gets together and selects one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. They say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think it's really because they're all sadistic. Or just bored. Thank God they're about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just scuttled in. I'm not even going to bother with chasing him this time. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's actually the opposite. The bag's full when he walks in and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter—I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" he says.  

I reach into my bag and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from my non-break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out here. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand, who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen (of course), and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand have been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out an accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, and then go looking for Paul. I find him in the freezer; he must've tripped over one of the dead bodies and knocked himself unconscious. *Fucking idiot*. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. On the way, I pass down aisle 13. The Spill That Never Dries is growing. It's eaten the Wet Floor sign that was next to it, just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though I know it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud: the coast is clear. I punched my number in, and I'm pleased to find the time clock hasn't stolen any of my hours today. I smile triumphantly and turn around. 

There's Paul, shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douchebag. I sigh. *Christ*, I just hope the rest of this week goes by fast. Maybe I'll call in sick tomorrow.

1n02bxx,https://i.redd.it/7g2i46eea8lf1.png,Pre-Procedure Care vs Post-Procedure Care for Hair Transplant,"A lot of people mix these up, but here’s a clear breakdown of what to do *before* and *after* your hair transplant to maximize healing and graft survival:

# Pre-Procedure Care (Before Surgery)

* Inform your doctor of all medical conditions and supplements.
* Stop blood-thinning meds (Aspirin, Plavix, fish oil, certain vitamins) if advised.
* Quit smoking & alcohol 14 days before surgery.
* Dye gray/light hair to black for better visibility.
* Have a light breakfast, but avoid tea/coffee.
* No gels, sprays, or styling products on surgery day.
* Wear a button-down shirt to avoid disturbing grafts after surgery.

# Post-Procedure Care (After Surgery)

* Don’t pick or scratch scabs (can dislodge grafts).
* Wash gently with room-temperature water.
* Avoid high-pressure water on scalp.
* No heavy sweating (exercise, sauna) for 14 days.
* Protect scalp from direct sunlight for 14 days.
* Wait 2+ months before coloring, perming, or straightening.
* Take all prescribed meds as directed.
* Attend all follow-up appointments.

Following the right **pre-procedure** and **post-procedure** care steps is just as important as the surgery itself. Preparation sets the stage for a safe procedure, while aftercare ensures graft survival and the best possible long-term results. 

# Many failed transplants happen not because of the surgeon, but because patients skip or misunderstand these crucial guidelines. 

# If you’re serious about protecting your investment and achieving natural, lasting results, stick to these steps carefully.",1,1756155171.0,HairTransplantsTruth,0,1.0,False

There is this guy at my class that I ran into at a coffee shop. We chatted and he seemed nice and asked me for my number. We were texting a few days and he then asks me if I want to hang out on the weekend. Before I meet up with anyone I always look them up online and what I found was incredibly disturbing. 

There is a site where women post their dating history/men they are seeing from apps. And what I found on their is distrubing. He sa's women and doesn't stop why they tell him no, he stealths, lied about his name and personal details. He sometimes has a gf and has a lot of side sex and has given multiple women STDs and he's posted across several cities on this site. 

After finding this out I told him I wasn't interested and for him to leave me alone at jiu jitsu and I blocked him. The next week I go to class an my coach partners me with him because he didn't have one. I'm always the only female in class and my regular partner wasn't there. I wanted to tell the coach no but it was really awkward and everyone was staring and i didn't want to cause a scene. I ignored him the whole time and then left immediately after class.

I emailed the gym that night asking them to please not pair me with him because he made me feel uncomfortable. 

It's been a week and I haven't heard from them. I also went to one class after and no one acknowledge my email. 

Is this normal? He didn't do anything to me in class so I understand it's not something they should police, but I thought they would at least acknowledge my email. I was okay to continue going as long as that was understood. Should I have said something in person? Do you think they saw my email and are ignoring it? Any advice is welcome.

I used to physically freeze just trying to say hi to people. The worst part wasn’t the silence,  it was walking away, replaying it in my head, hating myself, promising “next time.”

Last week I tried something different. Not theory, not motivational quotes. Just dumb little missions.

* First day: I forced myself to say good morning to a handful of strangers. 
* Next day: I threw out a couple of harmless compliments to stragers. 
* Day after that: I asked one open question and then bailed.

It felt ridiculous at first, but by day 3 my nervous system wasn’t screaming as loud. These are the little daily challenges the app gives me and my brain is adapting. Hit it at the grocery store, walked over, asked for a coffee recommendation, smiled, left. Nothing cinematic, but I didn’t implode.

By day 5 I was logging “wins” after each micro mission. It looked stupid at first, then kind of addicting. Saturday I even cracked a light joke with a stranger instead of going into interview mode. It landed. Sunday morning my brain didn’t call me an idiot, it asked “what’s today’s rep?”

I didn’t change who I am. I just stopped treating every small interaction like it was life or death. Turns out the trick was reps. The more I logged them, the more normal it felt.

I’ve got a question about dating that’s been on my mind. Why is it so hard to find a solid partner these days?:(

So recently I matched with a guy on a dating app. We texted a bit and he suggested we meet up right away. I figured, why waste weeks messaging if it might not click in person? We went for a walk around my neighborhood, talked for hours and honestly there was a spark.

Second date he invited me over for dinner, which felt too soon, so I told him that. He was totally fine with it and suggested another walk instead. We ended up in his area, stayed out until late just talking again. No intimacy yet, except some looks, but good vibes overall.

Last week he had family visiting, so we didn’t meet up, but he texted me every day with updates and pictures, which I liked. Now his family’s gone and I asked if we want to see ea h other again this week, to which he agreed. He suggested we meet in a couple of days after work (he’s a lawyer working in Court and has a big deadline). around 8pm. He was sorry that he couldn’t make it earlier due to his deadline. I just said that’s fine with me bc I don’t expect anything big and he told me about his deadline early on it’s nothing new and I know since his family stayed for the week, he couldn’t work on it.

Here’s my thing: I don’t just want to be someone he casually fits in between work and life. I’d like us to actually do something and get to know each other more intentionally, not just walk around all the time.

He’s been consistent with sharing about his life, but he doesn’t ask much about me – I usually share something aswell if he does and that keeps the convo going. Not sure if that says anything, or if I’m overthinking.

Was it a mistake to agree to another date this late? Or should I’ve said no and wait until his work is done? It’s due on the 8th of September btw. Especially curious what guys think about this. 
If he suggests to go on a walk again I will ask to go for a coffee instead or to the movies.

 **H. Pylori number was 2.08e3 btw (as of June)**

  
**Background:**  
I think i've had HP in some amount since probably 2015. I think I got it in Jamaica that year. I remember having abnormal stools/GI irritation for about 6 months, and thinking this might be the C word, quitting beer and coffee and going to a Primary Care. I also told them about my heart burn, bloating, and feeling hot in my stomach/chest at night. Of course they gave me antacids, told me welcome to your 30s, and sent me on my way. I managed... I would go on occasional diets, cleanses, feel better for a while and worse again. Stress of work, a lot of alcohol intake over the years, and more travel to other countries + add time in India on business trips - I always eat everything in front of me, everywhere I go - always have.

  
**Recently:**  
Sometime in March I started a full elimination diet. Had no idea at the time I had HP. Things got significantly better.  Then, one weekend I went out to eat and just had a steak with nothing on it, and baked potatoes (in olive oil). I was sick for a week. I thought I was going to be in the ER. Intense pain and gas for a week, thought I had gal bladder issues. I went to see a functional doctor finally in May. She ordered a GI Map and blood work. No gal bladder issues, and blood work was clean. The GI Map showed all kind of messed up balance + H Pylori. 4 weeks ago while i'm waiting for supplements to arrive, I  went back to 100% basic diet: Chicken + Broth, cooked carrots, celery, cooked eggs +green tea in the morning and literally NOTHING else. When I say these are the only ingredients, I mean this is ALL I eat. 2 weeks ago supplements arrived, and I started doing this:  


* **Pepto - 3 times a day, between meals (away from revive and sbi-protect)**
* **Candibactin-AR + Oil of Oregano (ADP) - with meals**
* **Zinc carnosine - with meals**
* **GI Revive - twice a day between meals**
* **SBI Protect - once a day between meals (away from all else)**
* **Potato water / cabbage juice - morning before breakfast, and evening before bed**

I've not had a flair up in 3 weeks. I feel like i'm 20 yrs old again most of the time except for the tired crash in the afternoons. I sleep well. I lost, 25lbs of stubborn belly fat and feel like i've got nothing left to lose. I am stopping the pepto today as it's the 2 week mark since I started that. I don't know if I should change anything else, but i'm tempted to introduce some additional food. Maybe cooked rice, avocado. I need more food! I am REALLY struggling with the tired aspect - I noticed if I don't eat at specific intervals, I will start to get tired, and by the time I think, I need to eat! - it's too late. I will crash for 3-4 hours. I assume it's because i'm in ketosis and my body isn't getting carbs as easily as I'm used to? I also struggle with some brain fog that I have never had at all - was not one of my symptoms. I simply feel like my brain is starved of carbs and I can't think. This diet is pretty tough for me. I work a lot at a day job, and burn a solid 4k-5k calories a day on weekends working on my family owned farm at least a few days a week. It's really tough to do that and keep eating like this. That said, I haven't felt this good or normal in years.

  
How much longer should I take the Potato water/cabbage juice, and the Oregano? I stopped the Pepto just now cause it's been two weeks and I read, don't take it longer than that. Any other tips - am I doing this all as recommended?

I’ve got a question about dating that’s been on my mind. Why is it so hard to find a solid partner these days?:(

So recently I matched with a guy on a dating app. We texted a bit and he suggested we meet up right away. I figured, why waste weeks messaging if it might not click in person? We went for a walk around my neighborhood, talked for hours and honestly there was a spark.

Second date he invited me over for dinner, which felt too soon, so I told him that. He was totally fine with it and suggested another walk instead. We ended up in his area, stayed out until late just talking again. No intimacy yet, except some looks, but good vibes overall.

Last week he had family visiting, so we didn’t meet up, but he texted me every day with updates and pictures, which I liked. Now his family’s gone and I asked if we want to see ea h other again this week, to which he agreed. He suggested we meet in a couple of days after work (he’s a lawyer working in Court and has a big deadline). around 8pm. He was sorry that he couldn’t make it earlier due to his deadline. I just said that’s fine with me bc I don’t expect anything big and he told me about his deadline early on it’s nothing new and I know since his family stayed for the week, he couldn’t work on it. I just want to see him again and spend some time with him.

Here’s my thing: I don’t just want to be someone he casually fits in between work and life. I’d like us to actually do something and get to know each other more intentionally, not just walk around all the time.

sometimes is really good stuff to ponder at, most of the time they lump me who is a male into topics that basically paint me bad or just ""complacent"" due to me not being involved with anything as a activist (i work a full time job usually 12, 15 hrs a day an i usually come home around 2-4am)

not only that im a male and a Hispanic due to that being a added denominator you could perhaps already know what kind of person they paint me due to being only focused on my job and why they paint me as ""complacent""

my partner doesn't see it as a issue when all her friends tell her im not a good person, she states that ""that's there opinion even when its not true"" she doesn't defend me or want to say anything where there wrong about me

and i get it, me being me who works a lot and doesn't put myself in a predicament where i could loose my job or miss out in future jobs or opportunity's for better pay (and mind you im the main bread winner)

What should I do now?,"So I recently left my old job for a new opportunity, and one of my coworkers from my previous job asked if we could exchange numbers to stay in touch. We didn't interact much outside of work, so I never thought much of it and didn't expect him to be interested in me

He started texting me here and there, asking about my new job and just sending random messages. I thought it was just a friendly way to keep in touch. One time, he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee, and I agreed. During the conversation, we talked about food, and he
mentioned that he likes to date girls from my ethnic background. I didn't think anything of it - just laughed and didn't respond.

A few days later, I reached out and told him I was going to try the restaurant he recommended (we haven't met for coffee yet). He responded with more food talk, then said he knows another great place and would love to take me there. I agreed, thinking he was just offering like how other colleagues sometimes ask to meet for lunch
to catch up. I didn't think he was asking me out on a date!

Then, right after I agreed, he asked if I was in a
relationship or seeing someone, saying he wanted to make sure he wasn't overstepping. For some reason, that made me nervous! I flustered and, without thinking, replied, ""No, I'm not seeing anyone, and I don't mind meeting up for food sometime, but this is just a regular hangout, right?"" He said yes, just wanted to check, and then the conversation ended and I haven't received a text from him ever since.

It didn't hit me until he asked me if I was seeing someone that that he was actually asking me out on a date! I got nervous because I didn't realize he was interested in me, and I'm just not good at talking to guys ⁃ I'm super introverted. Also, he hardly spoke to me when we worked together for 2 years, so I still wonder if he really did ask to go on a date. 

 After thinking it over, I realized he seems like a decent guy, and I probably came off as not
interested.

It's been three weeks now, and this has been on my mind. From a guy's perspective, would it be a good idea for me to text him and apologize for how I answered and explain that I flustered because I was surprised? Or is it better to just leave it and move on? 1 don't want to make
him feel uncomfortable.

TL;DR: I accidentally rejected a guy I like. He asked me out, but I didn't realize he was interested and got nervous when he asked if I was in a relationship. I flustered and responded in a way that might've made him think I wasn't
interested. It's been 3 weeks, and I'm wondering if I should apologize and explain I was surprised, or just leave it alone.

The hum of the city filters faintly through the windows. The kitchen is small but lived-in: coffee brewing, sunlight spilling across a cluttered table stacked with newspapers, books, and the faint smell of solder from last night’s tinkering.

 

Gwen, barefoot in one of Peter’s old Midtown Science hoodies, slices strawberries at the counter. Her hair is still damp from a quick shower. Sue Storm sits nearby with a steaming mug, clearly still waking up, her posture loose in the easy comfort of visiting friends.

 

SUE

(gentle, curious)

Mind if I ask you something before the caffeine sets in?

 

GWEN

(smirks without looking up)

Sue, you’ve seen me scrub web-fluid off the ceiling at three in the morning. I think the statute of secrets has expired.

 

(Sue laughs, shaking her head.)

 

SUE

Okay, fair. It’s just—Peter calls you “Gwendy.” It’s… sweet. Where’s that from?

 

(Gwen pauses mid-slice. A smile tugs at her mouth, soft and private. She sets the knife down, leaning against the counter as if the memory deserves her full attention.)

 

GWEN

May.

 

(Sue arches a brow, waiting. Gwen’s smile widens, her voice dropping into something warmer, like she’s unwrapping a gift.)

 

GWEN

When he was a kid, Aunt May used to read him Peter Pan every night. Over and over, sometimes the same chapter until she fell asleep in the chair. He loved the adventure, the flying, the Lost Boys—but what stayed with him was Peter and Wendy.

 

(Her tone gentles further, the words carrying a weight of affection.)

So… Peter and Wendy became Peter and Gwendy. It stuck before he even knew what love was supposed to be.

 

(Sue’s expression softens. She presses a hand to her chest, visibly moved.)

 

SUE

That’s… beautiful.

 

GWEN

(grinning again, deflecting with humor)

Well, it was either that or “Spider-Girl,” and I think we can both agree I dodged a very sticky bullet there.

 

(Sue chuckles, shaking her head. She reaches out, squeezing Gwen’s arm with quiet fondness.)

 

SUE

No wonder he still says it like a prayer.

 

(Gwen’s teasing fades. Her voice drops into something quieter, steady but vulnerable.)

 

GWEN

He never stopped being her little boy. He just grew into a man who remembers how to love like one.

 

(A beat of silence. The coffee machine hisses. Gwen slides the finished bowl of strawberries across the counter. Sue takes one, smiling faintly as if savoring more than just the fruit.)

 

GWEN

Besides… “Gwendy” beats “Pumpkin” any day.

 

(From the hallway, Peter’s voice cuts in—loud, playful, unashamed.)

 

PETER (O.S.)

I heard that!

 

(Both women burst out laughing. Gwen flicks a strawberry slice into her mouth, shaking her head.)

 

SUE

You do realize he’s probably been listening this whole time.

 

GWEN

Of course. He’s Peter. He can’t help himself.

 

(A door creaks. Peter pokes his head in, hair messy, grinning like he’s already in on the joke. Gwen and Sue exchange a look that says this is our life, fond exasperation and love bundled together. The city hums outside, the morning moves on, but

the tenderness of the moment lingers like sunlight through glass.)

1n01tlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/erectiledysfunction/comments/1n01tlb/32_how_i_cured_my_year_long_ed/,32 - How I cured my year long ED,"Hey everyone! I’m not used to making posts on Reddit so I apologize in advanced if my formatting isn’t the best looking. 

For those who just want the TL;DR, it will be at the bottom of my post.

First and foremost, please go see your doctor if you haven’t already to rule out physical vs psychological ED. While I fixed my ED, I’m not a doctor. If anyone has any questions, I’m more than happy to answer to the best of my abilities, but if you haven’t seen your doctor yet while going through this problem, you’re not doing yourself any favors and delaying yourself from either fixing your ED or treating it. There are many causes of ED and my solution may not be the reason for your ED.

Backstory: I’m a 32 year old male, 5’10”, with a wife, and one child as of the time of writing this post (planning on another in the near future). I lift weights 4-5 times a week and do 2-3 mile runs about 3 times a week. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week for work where I wouldn’t consider my job to be very physically demanding. I never had an issue with ED throughout my life up until about a year ago. The only times I could think of having an issue achieving an erection is when I’ve already performed multiple times earlier in the day or if I was mentally unable to perform, but otherwise I had no issues achieving an erection daily. In fact, It was extremely rare when I wouldn’t wake up with an erection. 

One day my wife and I were being intimate and I noticed it was taking a lot longer to achieve an erection and even then, it would get to maybe 70% full hardness. I realized what was happening in the moment and it went downhill from there. I felt defeated, less of a man, and felt that my wife internally must be feeling that I’m not finding her to be attractive anymore (which is false because my wife is stunning). My wife was supportive though and just said that maybe I was stressed out and just trying to push through it because “I’m a man and men would never turn down sex”. Some days were better than others but ultimately it was happening too frequently and I had a lot of performance anxiety because of it.

Like some of you, I started noticing ads for blue chew and thought that was the solution for the time being but I knew that I didn’t want to rely on this for my age. I decided to get a prescription for it and while it did help immensely, there were days it didn’t really do anything, so I thought, maybe it’s psychological, but just in case, I made an appointment with my doctor so check things out and run blood work. My doctor found nothing wrong physically and my bloodwork came back all good other than my cholesterol was barely over the normal limit (family history of high cholesterol), but my doctor said that wouldn’t cause this issue. Just for everyone’s knowledge, my testosterone was at 534 and this was about 6 months after the ED symptoms started. 

I went down the rabbit hole online and tried just about every supplement I could think of. MACA, beetroot powder, horny goat weed, magnesium , ashwaganda, Nitric Oxide Booster (L-Arginine, L-Citrulline), Zinc. None of these did a lick of anything. I’m not saying they don’t work for others and could work for those who currently don’t take them, they just didn’t work for me.

I gave “no fap” and quitting porn a shot as well. I’ve always had watched porn since I was a young teen so I thought maybe this could be it. After a month of this, nothing was helping. Some people were claiming it took 3 months to even a year until improvement, but if I’m being honest, I didn’t want to wait that long nor do I think that was causing my issue as I never had an issue with my porn habits and I refuse to believe that after 20 years of porn, that all the sudden at 32, I’m getting ED from it. I tried no fap and quitting porn on top of taking supplements I mentioned above and improving my diet.

I started working out and taking better care of myself starting in September 2021 after seeing a photo of myself I was disgusted with. I’ve lost over 90 pounds since then and I currently weigh in at 185 pounds and want to lose about 10-15 more pounds. I started eating cleaner, eating out at restaurants and fast food less, maybe once every 2-3 weeks (I live in California and it’s hard to pass up a double double at in n out from time to time). If we did go out, I would track the calories and macros. I did make the mistake of not eating enough fats in my diet and I thought at the time maybe that could be it since fats help with hormones. I took a small break from being in a calorie deficit for about a few weeks where I focused on eating more fats such as avocados, peanut butter, higher fat meats, pumpkin seeds, and ate tuna as often as it’s recommended. Still, this wasn’t helping at all. 

I started to evaluate if I had any stress in my life that could be causing it. I thankfully have a job that’s not stressful at all so I knew work wasn’t causing it. My child can be a lot and demanding physically and emotionally (they are 4 as of this post) but I still didn’t feel that was the issue either. Financially, my wife and I do well enough in life. We have a home and do our best to maintain it. We both have students loans we need to pay off as well. I do wish we were able to save more money but I am comfortable with where we are at. My wife and I are happy together as well other than feeling like we are struggling intimately because physical intimacy is a big love language for the both of us, but with this ED, it’s been making that challenging.

The more time that passed, the more I noticed my libido was slowly tanking. It got to the point where when my wife went topless or naked, it didn’t do anything for me in that department, where normally, I could feel the rush of hormones surging through my body and it would be my goal to motorboat her or get her in bed. I even noticed I had 0 interest in porn or just seeing women naked in general. Even my favorite porn videos were lackluster and I kept getting sidetracked between looking at porn and browsing social media. 
 
At this point, I had a good idea what was causing it. My problems started happening about 6 months of daily using this thing. I didn’t want to believe it because I didn’t want to give it up at the time. That thing was Marijuana. 

I know I’m going to have the stoners and others come in here and say how marijuana actually helps them in the bedroom and it does the complete opposite for them. I was one of you as well. When I first started smoking weed, I was super aroused and had the BEST orgasms of my life when I was high.  Overtime though, the arousal and the orgasms were not as amazing as they once were. 

I solely used marijuana at night only for sleeping. I struggle with falling asleep at night where it takes me anywhere from 1-3 hours to relax enough to fall asleep (I have been diagnosed with ADHD and racing thoughts at night are extremely common for me). Marijuana helped me fall asleep in a matter of minutes, something melatonin and other sleep aids even failed to do. Although I thought marijuana was helping me sleep better, it actually wasn’t.

After researching, I found Marijuana reduces REM sleep. Before I was a daily user, I had lucid dreams almost every night. With marijuana, I never had any lucid dreams and I would wake up feeling so exhausted and restless no matter how much sleep I got. I simply just kept brushing it off thinking nothing of it. 

As much as I didn’t want to at the time, I had to ask myself; is marijuana more important or is having erections and my sex drive more important. The answer was obvious for me. On July 25th, 2025 was the last time I smoked or used any thc products. 

The first 4 days, sleep was a challenge but I started having lucid dreams again on day 2. 

On day 5, I woke up in the morning and had a semi-filled erection with no stimulation but I also noticed that I felt more well rested, which I found crazy because this was a work day and I had to get up at 3am. I even noticed I didn’t need more than one cup of coffee to feel awake where normally I would need at least 2 to even feel like I could tolerate the day.  

On day 7, I started feeling a small surge of hormones when I saw my wife topless or in some outfit I thought was sexy as well as seeing other attractive women. I even started staring at her (my wife) ass more and had some real dirty thoughts about what I wanted to do to that ass.

On day 13, I woke up with a MASSIVE erection that was so full it was slightly hurting and I was HORNY. It was so hard that I could put a hole through my drywall. It was the first time in a while that I woke my wife up with my unit and we had amazing sex that we haven’t had in so long. I was even able perform again later that day. 

On day 18, I woke up with another strong erection, went to work, and started noticing all the gorgeous women I would see in my daily life, it was like they were all glowing that day. All I could think about was getting home and relieving myself, which I did two more times; one with the wife and one time by myself because, well let’s just say my wife had a VIP ticket to poundtown and we were intimate for so long that she was physically too tired and too sore for another round so I just ended up taking care of it myself. Nearly every day since day 18, I have been waking up with solid erections and can usually perform at least twice a day. 

I feel like I am myself again. I am confident and don’t have any anxiety issues with performing now. My sex drive feels back to my normal. I still have the blue chews as a backup just in case and to give me a confidence booster if I’m feeling a little anxious or worried about performing on a particular day. I will in fact be unsubscribing from blue chew here in about a month or so, I just personally want to have it as backup for now and have another month pass by of having my erections and libido back. 

I’m writing this post because I know there are others out there like me; young, smoke weed, and having erection issues. I know we all have/had our reasons for smoking weed but I want to challenge you to ask yourself: is your reason for smoking/using weed more important than your erections and libido? Do you miss taking your girl/guy/partner to poundtown? Do you miss that surge of hormones you felt daily/near daily when you see someone attractive? Do you miss not worrying about maintaining an erection? I challenge you to give up Marijuana to see if this works for you when nothing else did.

Please note: Everyone is going to have different results and different recovery rates with giving up Marijuana. Previous Reddit posts I read showed some people took a month or longer to recover. I’m sure this depends on how often they smoked/used marijuana on the daily and the amount of years they continued to do it at the rate they were doing it at. Don’t be that person that hides their marijuana use not only on these subreddits, but to your doctor as well if you are trying to cure your ED. 

This post is for those who resonate with the same issues I had and tried many things like I did to fix their ED but haven’t made the jump to quit Marijuana yet. If Marijuana works for you, great. Everyone is different and substances affect everyone differently, especially with erections. 

Lastly, I want to also recommend to you to not only see your doctor and be honest about your marijuana use, but to start working out and eating cleaner if you haven’t already while giving up marijuana. Find a weight lifting routine and get some cardio in a few times a week as well to keep your circulation strong. If you’re worried about what other people think of you in the gym, we don’t care what you look like at all. For me, seeing someone who’s obese working out in the gym reminds me where I started and these people continue to motivate me today still. If someone is making fun of you, I guarantee if someone else overhears them,
they will not only be shunned, most gyms will actually kick that person out. If videoing yourself helps you, then I say do it, but don’t video others without their permission and make sure your gym allows you to shoot video or you might risk getting kicked out. You might start noticing a side effect of the gym is guys coming up to you and calling you “big dawg”, complimenting how defined one of your muscles are, asking you what your routine is, and the biggest side effect of all; getting addicted to the “pump”.

My baby is 3.5 months and exclusively breast fed.  I had cut dairy (9) and soy (4) weeks ago and has just been getting back to baseline with some mucous but overall normal stools.  On August 5th we started amoxicillin for an ear infection and all hell broke loose. Green watery mucous stools all day every day.  We have been off the antibiotics 11 days and we are still having mucosy runny stools that will now have blood occasionally which we haven’t seen since we cut soy.  The only change to my diet was an almond milk coffee creamer (which I have since cut in case that is what is causing the issues as of 3 days ago) 

I’m so spent and frustrated- he is a happy baby, no signs of pain and his pediatrician literally said “well maybe he was exposed to milk” which I can promise you he hasn’t been. 

Is it possible that we are still healing from soy? And the amoxicillin ruining his system is elongating this issue?  We meet with our new doctor in a couple weeks but I truly don’t know where to go from here.  ",3,1756153990.0,MSPI,1,1.0,False

1n01qon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n01qon/advice_needed_small_chronic_issues_going/,Advice needed. Small chronic issues going undiagnosed affecting quality of life.,"Hi, Everyone this is my first time posting on Reddit and I'm hoping to ask for some insight in health issues I have been having lately. I have been having a lot of overlapping but seperate small health issues and each of my Drs/specialists is basically diagnosing me with ""I don't know"" reaching out here to see if anyone here has heard of something for any of the issues or if maybe there is something going on big picture wise with all of the issues. I will try to provide length of time for issues, but I feel things have been getting worse overall for several years now so it's hard to know exactly when things started. For context I am a 23year woman 6ft 142lbs and is appearing healthy in pretty much all medical tests and evaluations. While I know none of these are life threatening it's gotten to the point where I am always experiencing some kind of pain or discomfort and my energy and quality of life is decreasing. Anyway here are the list of symptoms.

Digestive Related(the worst category) 
Went through a lot of tests with a gastroligist and just got diagnosed with IBS

- Constipation: prone since young childhood but more frequent and related to period past 2-4 years and a handful of extremely bad cases(4+ days without bathroom visit) past 1.5 years.
-Difficulty pooping, pain/straining/a few drops of blood/sing coffee as laxative regularly as in almost daily past 6months
-Lack of appetite and hunger ques. Some days are normal but overall have limited hunger signs and can easily undereat. Get full easily, easily turned off by foods, a lot of mental energy to make sure I get enough calories in a day. 
-Lack of thirst. Suspect this has been lifelong. First brought to my attention 2ish years ago and can be temporarily cured with electrolytes but after regular or discontinued use of electrolytes thirst fades again. Ik dehydration is really bad for you and is probably causing a lot of these symptoms but it really is difficult for me to drink liquids especially water. (I can go 8+ hours without drinking anything and not notice till I get a headache.) Drinking water when I don't feel thirsty tastes gross and makes me feel bloated and sick. 
-Bloating and Gas. Most prominent the past 1.5 years. Wake up painfully bloated, sometimes trouble sleeping due to pain in abdomen. Bloating in upper abdominal decreases appetite. Most days am belching/passing gas regularly through the day. 

Vaginal
I have paraguard copper IUD. Same monogamous partner of 3 years.

-yeast infections: prone since I hit puberty but 5ish times a year for the past 2-4 years. Currently struggling with something that feels like a yeast infection but Dr swab came back negative.
-pain during intercourse: Past 2 months. Sore raw feeling a few inches inside. Intense pain/burning like when I have a UTI when having something inside me.(I do not currently have a UTI) Pain is extremely intense and results inability to participate in sexual activities at all. 

Other 
-Extreme fatigue: worse during period but I can't remember the last time I felt reasonably energized for more than 2 hours at a time. Especially bad when driving even if I get in the car fully energized in the morning I struggle to not doze a few minutes after starting to drive. I am sleeping 7-9 hours a night with a generally consistent bedtime. 
-hip,low back, shoulder pain: A chiropractor recently told me my spine doesn't have some of its natural curve. I've seen chiropractors before and Drs and nobody's mentioned that before so idk. Hip pain occurs periodically if I don't stretch and exercise daily. Deep in my hips causes intense distracting pain, will take pain meds to sleep if this is occuring. Back pain usually related to standing or period. Standing means standing still more than a few minutes. Shoulder pain usually related to sleeping weird but will persist for several days and can be distracting. I pop all of my joints several times a day to relieve mild discomfort but these are not easily released issues. 

Other notes that might be helpful
-about 2 years ago I was going to be in a medical study as a control and had intensive blood work come back clean. Didn't go through due to a bout of constipation disqualifying me. 
-I lock my knees when I stand. Realized this about a year ago and try to not do it anymore but is still very common. 
-My period happens every month but ranges by about 4 days either way from prediction. Lasts about 8-10 days total and my symptoms are different every month.
-still struggling with acne. Usually have at least 1 deep irritated pimple. I have a good skincare routine. 


Thank you for anyone who read this and all opinions or advice are welcome. I just don't know what to ask my Drs anymore and I'm hoping for some leads in possible causes to bring up to them. ",1,1756153828.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

For a while, I used ""substances"" as life enhancers, and today reminded me of those old days, a boost, maybe, but overall, they're shit.  
  
Most mornings, *I wake up tired yet going to bed late*. My sleep pattern is a freestyle, so I *forget the value of starting small*. Even tiny steps count. Like today, three push-ups, some coffee and a cigarette, and three hours spent on my phone without moving from bed. But honestly, **compared to nothing**, those push-ups feel like progress.  
  
I keep telling myself to take it slow. **Don’t overthink it**. It’s OK to chill out and give yourself the space to relax. It’s often in those slower moments that you notice the little rewards life gives you, the good stuff that seems to show up when you *really care about what you’re doing*.  
  
And then there’s that inner voice. *It’s quiet, but it’s got power*. It’s super easy to ignore it, to look away, to hope the pressure just fades. But if you actually listen, you get a glimpse of *real peace*, a sense you can’t really put into words. If you stop denying its existence a window opens to his *powerful insights and ideas about your purpose.*  
  
It’s like someone reaching out a hand and **all you have to fucking do is to grab it...**  
  
*But then, bam, fear shows up*. Suddenly, you’re anxious and stuck, can’t make a decision. That fear just kind of wraps around you, and it doesn’t have to fight; you’re already feeling **weak and exposed**. When that happens, it’s like your mind gets overloaded. The body keeps going and can fight back fast, but if your spirit is stuck, nothing moves.  
  
So all you can do is try to listen in, take it easy, and let yourself move at your own pace. Progress isn’t always loud or dramatic. Sometimes the best thing is just to answer that quiet voice and keep going, one step at a time.",1,1756153763.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False

After 6 weeks of driving the Ioniq5 I have the following complaints and not sure if there are solutions to the problems, so I’ll just throw it out there.  
 
1).  The front seats are so stiff they are causing lower back pain even when driving short distances.  Didn’t notice this during the test drive.  

2). The wireless phone charger is wasted space.  The charger overheats phones within 10 minutes while not adequately charging the device.  This a huge area that is useless is there a way to disconnect the charger so we can at least set our phone in that spot?  

3). In the front there is nothing to block the space between the driver and passenger side floor of the vehicle.  If a passenger in the front seat dropped something (such as a kid with a ball), it could easily roll over to the drivers side and slide under the break pedal.  

4). The speedometer is in a bad place.  If your left hand is anywhere from 10-12 on the steering wheel, a part or all of the speedometer will be blocked from view.  

5). The volume and song control on the 2019 Ioniq are on the left hand side of the steering wheel.  On the 2025 Ioniq the controls are on the right hand side of the steering wheel.  When driving with a cup of coffee or other beverage it is not ideal as the cup holders are on the right hand side.  It’s much harder to control the volume on the steering wheel in the ioniq5. 

6). The safety mechanisms in the car seem to  make it less safe as the car is always yelling at us and takes away our focus.  Parked in the driveway, it notices a tree 10 feet away and alerts us that we are too close.  

Thankfully it’s just a lease that we are locked into.  At this point we will be letting the car go back in two years. If there were a way out of the lease, we would do it this week.  The 2019 Ioniq electric has been an amazing car, except for the fact it eats tires.  The car goes through a new set of tires for the front once a year, about every 15-20k miles. Driving pretty conservative in eco mode. Never had a car eat tires the way this one does.

Like, am I the only one who slept on this goldmine, or are people secretly stacking their side hustles and not telling us? Because… **I am SHOOK!**

I mean—test an app. Click a few buttons. Get money sent to your PayPal or CashApp? That’s IT?

You’re telling me people haven’t seen **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** yet??

Let me lay down the TOP 7 LEGIT apps that are *paying people* to do what you’re already doing: scrolling, downloading, and literally giving your opinion. I still can’t believe how EASY this is in 2025.

### 🤑 1. **TestApp Pay**
You want EASY $$$? This is it. 
Install, test out new upcoming app features, leave honest feedback—boom. I pocketed fifty bucks in literally an hour last weekend using **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. I keep refreshing my notifications like… did that even happen?? 💸

### ⚡ 2. **Beta Bling**
How does “try first, get paid for bugs” sound? You find glitches, submit tester notes, and your digital wallet gets fatter. They have new gigs every week. You get to feel like a secret app spy.

### 😱 3. **Mystery Features Lab**
This one got me GASPING—chat with real devs about unreleased stuff, share ideas, AND every feedback logs you extra bonus cash. You are actually shaping the apps everyone will use next year. Say what!?

### 🔥 4. **InsightRewards**
I thought this was a scam but NO! This app pays literal cash, not coins, for each step: download, explore features, and just say what makes you confused. Money INSTANTLY shows in your PayPal. I DM’d my friend like “IS THIS LEGAL???”

### 🤯 5. **FeatureFind**
Memes and games, productivity, even AI stuff—you get to be FIRST for beta testing! This feels like cheating. They even paid me when my test crashed?? **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** dropped another invite code here, y’all…

### 😲 6. **EarlyBird Beta**
New-gen products, vote for features, and record voice notes—absolutely wild experience. There’s a scoreboard and the top testers make legit side income. They email you almost every day with surveys.

### 👀 7. **PayForTesting**
Download, use new app tools, and you EARN for every feature you try, with low payout thresholds. The more honest, the more SURPRISE bonuses. Won’t lie, I freaked out seeing money in my account after just turning on dark mode. **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is recommended for all serious testers.

1n01n7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1n01n7h/miraculous_sudden_nervous_system_adaption_after/,miraculous sudden nervous system adaption after 10 years of PVCs,"Almost 10 years ago over the course of 1-2 months I developed PVCs in the range of 200 a day, which would then within weeks escalate to about 10,000 a day at baseline. My lifestyle was poor and lots of stress at the time. In the next 2-5 years I would fix bad lifestyle, quit smoking, coffee, tons of aerobic and non aerobic exercise and such which reduced them to somewhat over 1,000 a day eventually. I tried everything you can possibly imagine, including highly restrictive diets and arrays of supplements. But as soon as I would just touch one cigarette or cup of coffee or eat chocolate, it would cause episodes. In the end there was nothing left to do, and the reduction each year through exercise and just body healing was very low. So I was stuck with about 800 or so until recently when religiously avoiding all triggers that you can imagine, and maybe it was going down 50 each year or something. Nothing notable. When not avoiding triggers, it could be as bad as maybe 4,000 a day again, so and so.

Then last year what happened was unusual. I would get episodes where I first experienced something known as ""interpolated PVCs"". This is when the sinoatrial node does not reset from the PVC, and you don't feel the harder pump that comes after. It feels more like the heart beats twice as fast. Since I sit a lot at my PC with earmuffs on in the quiet, I am very aware of those things most of the time and they don't just go unnoticed. At the time I was concerned about this, and it was actually possible to communicate with my body, and tell it that it is not such a good idea to try this. So then I was back to normal PVCs after a while due to mind-body communication. But then the harder pumps were annoying me, and I thought ""ok, fuck it, let's do it this way instead"". And so I did, and stopped paying attention to it.

Now here is the strangest thing: I have athletic cardiovascular health, and my resting heart rate has always been as low as 45 because of it, but my blood pressure was always 120/80. Now over the course of half a year, my body seems to have switched to resting heart rate 70 and blood pressure 105/60 instead. I can drink coffee now and smoke cigarettes and only my heart rate goes up a little and blood pressure always remains low. And it does not really result in a lot of PVCs anymore! And it is not as if I am having interpolated PVCs all the time. My heart rate is actually constant, as if healthy.

It seems what happened is that due to my body switching to a low blood pressure state (instead of low heart rate, hence resulting in same oxygenation), it basically acts like beta blockers, but it is much more effective, and I am not really triggered that much by stress or food anymore. I am not sure what my burden is now but I would guess around 200-300 perhaps most days. And if I avoided all triggers (which I don't anymore, I drink coffee daily now), perhaps it would be close to zero.

It all started when my body was seemingly trying to adapt to the problem with the interpolated PVCs (which transiently doubled my heart rate from 45 to 90). And then it seemed to have figured out this trick with the heart rate and blood pressure.

So perhaps if you consciously try to lower your blood pressure as well and increase your heart rate in return, you can accomplish the same thing? Also perhaps you can tell your body that it is ok to try out PVC interpolation, rather than suppressing it like I did at first. To some degree you can really mentally influence these things.

You never know, but the strangest things can suddenly happen after 10 years in your favor!",1,1756153609.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False
1n01mtm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n01mtm,"How to charge power stations/batteries at slow 240V AC EV stations while on the road, utilizing both 240v and 120v with a current splitter.","Disclaimer: It does have a sign says EV only, but no EV here using them. Instead of idling, I could utilize it to charge my power stations. Especially I’m paying money like the EV owners, my money is as good as anyone else’s. It’s kind of breaking rules, but for over a year, I haven’t see any charger owners came to tell me I can’t use it because I’m not an EV. I usually park over night at an EV station while I need to charge to full. Electricity is cheaper in the night, less traffic, and cold temperatures in night, and I need a place for the night anyway.

Alright let’s get into the topic.

1, I’m at North America, so my example mainly work in NA. EU, Asia, South America use different voltage, pretty sure the power stations sold at those regions are different from NA version.

I haven’t tried, but you should be able to use a AC to DC charger to charge raw 12v/24v/48v DC batteries. Question, is there any 240V AC to DC charger?

2, this is a Rivian level 2, 240Vac/48A/11.5kW, EV charger. It could work at other brands like charge point, blink.

3, I’m using an Ecoflow Delta Pro to take 240Vac as input, and a Bluetti Apex 300 to take 120Vac as input(I know Apex 300 can take 240Vac with a dedicated cable, I will talk about that later)

4, The cables used, in the order.

A J1772 to Nema 14-50 adapter(rated 50amps, \*neutral line absent\*).

A NEMA 14-50P to 2x C19 splitter, each split rated 20amp

A C20 to C15 cable, which goes into Delta Pro’s AC port(C14 port), it’s 240Vac without step down.

A Stepdown says can do 5000w, but can only do 2500w stably, I keep the load under 2000w to avoid overheating/killing the unit. This stepdown is kind of fragile under heavy load.

I‘m not posting any links I don’t want to look like I’m earning cash back out of this or doing advertisement. I’m sure you can find them with google. After stepdown to 120v, I can basically plug any appliances that take 120Vac. I used a bug zapper as an example, but you can plug in your coffee machine or 120V air conditioner to it, as long as it doesn’t overload the step down.

5, One import thing I do want to point out, look at the Picture 7, both Apex 300 and Delta Pro use C14 port to take AC input.

The BIG DIFFERENCE here is Delta Pro can take 240Vac, while Apex 300 can only take 120Vac.

Apex 300 can take 240Vac as input, if I buy a $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable. Obviously Apex 300 internal structure can handle 240Vac, all they had to do is adding a switch, route the current if 240Vac is plugged in the C14 port. But they didn’t do it, for a product designed in 2025 Bluetti hasn’t thought of that. Delta Pro came out at 2021, yet Ecoflow did it correctly 4 years ago.

If I plug in the 240Vac into Apex 300, it will report a E113 voltage high error.

And for the $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable, it can do 50amp at 240v so 12kW maximum. I’m not sure I would buy it, since most of the time I just charge at a speed <1000w. I’d rather pay less money as for a slimmer cable rated with less amps for cheaper.

I might do a Apex 300 Vs Delta Pro comparison later, not a fair comparison since Delta Pro is from 2021, while Apex 300 is from 2025.

The first week of training my trainer was acting a bit off but still made a welcoming environment for me to learn it, that week consisted of computer training and cs training and that was it. During that time we did coffee tastings and talked and seemingly got along but things were kind of off? The first day I had come in I noticed her talking poorly about myself and our SM without realizing I was right there.

Second week starts and she becomes a completely different person, she made me feel like I don't belong whatsoever when one of Starbucks values is belonging. I come in and she's rude right off the bat, whenever I mess up she gets incredibly irritated (I'd understand if it wasn't my first time on each position but obviously I was brand new) if I needed help I'd tell her ""hey I'm really busy and there's some things I still don't know how to do, do you mind if you come over and help?"" and she would dismiss me and say ""You don't need help."" then leave and help baristas that have been there years longer than I have. Another time I went to look on a tablet for a recipe and she snatched it out of my hand saying she wants me to guess (it was a lunch rush on hot bar). 

I'm aware Starbucks has standards for green beans and wants them to learn without their trainers help if they are on the position and fully trained on it but that wasn't the case for me. Starbucks needs to have higher standards for who they hire as trainers because clearly some people just aren't good with others and just want the pay raise of having a better position.

Should I report her or see if things get better from now on? Last week she created more negative situations for no reason so I feel this won't come to an end. I was very close to quitting during my second week in training because she made my work environment so miserable.",1,1756153581.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False

My mornings are quieter without rushing to make elaborate coffee, I'm reading more books from the library instead of buying them, and I'm cooking simple meals at home that taste better than most of the expensive takeout I was getting.  
  
It's like I was trapped in this cycle where I worked more to buy more to feel better, but the things weren't actually making me happier. Now I'm trying to be more intentional about what I actually need versus what I think I want.

*How redundant*, Martin thought. He was staring at his computer, as he always did in these past four days. A schematic was on the screen, showcasing his newest model for the implant in Viktor's head. He thought he must have the idea down for sure, but couldn't quite get it to do what he wanted. He didn't want to put another soldier through testing, not until he was sure the safety was working well enough. With so little time remaining, he wasn't sure he'd be able to uphold that standard.

According to the reports that he'd seen, Viktor kept up to his work as well, managing the Nanoforge and showing the Decks how to create and program the nano-drug. There were soldiers who wanted to try using it after some more showcasing, but Nataly, thankfully, didn't let anyone do so. And Viktor just looked like he didn't care. Martin wasn't that surprised. Discovering that your family is dead, no matter how, hurts on another level. One that many could not even imagine. Martin knew that very well from first-hand experience. He'd only wished they had more time. Time he could spend talking with Viktor, doing something that could help bandage the wounds. Time he could spend with George, Timothea... Nataly. But time was the one thing Martin did not have, and so he just locked himself into his lab, trying to create new schematics, new machines, each better than the last one. He'd already sent the arm and legs prototypes to the manufactory, and Nataly should have them by now. She looked more human with them, their shapes full, almost like human limbs. Perhaps he'd convince her to not paint them black, but a skin-tone color instead.

*Yeah, like that's gonna work*, he chuckled to himself. Maybe if he got her a paint set so she could 'tattoo' the legs, though. Wiping his eyes, the scratchy spot not leaving, he looked at the screen again. One of the smallest things he'd had to create, yet it was the biggest piece of crap he'd tried creating so far. His head still swam when he tried understanding how the nano-drug worked. Viktor always babbled about how he just programmed them to speed a person up, but that command seemed too simple, too short, and non-defined to produce the effect that it did. There was something more to it, something that he was missing. The implant was supposed to just inject the drug in small quantities that the user could regulate, but the stoppers on it were not working correctly whenever the user had had enough of the drug. Like... as if it reprogrammed itself.

Maybe that's it? But how? The nanobots are to small to do any greater operations. Martin leaned back on his chair, cracking his knuckles. This was too hard, and he needed sleep. He couldn't sleep much, not until Damian and the Flames' boss Jake prepared details for the next op, but he couldn't get anything done like this anyway. He closed the tab with his latest implant schematic and went to... Fuck, did I save? He opened it back up, restored the data, sent a new knife prototype to the manufactory, and turned the damn box off. Unplugging from the charger, his heart now at one hundred percent, he stood and went to his room, where he promptly fell into his bed, not bothering with an Alarm. Hopefully, Nataly would wake him up anyway.

He woke up with a groan, the knocking, or banging rather, on the door waking him up. Putting on his glasses, he opened the door. Nataly and Viktor both stood there, clothed in their normal attire, looking at him expectantly.

After a while of silence, Nataly spoke softly, with an undertone of a person who predicted the situation at hand. ''You forgot, didn't you, Martin?''

The sleepiness clung to martin like wet clothing to a man, and he couldn't even begin to try to think of all the things he'd forgotten about. ''Probably. Forgot what?''

Nataly turned and opened her palm in front of Viktor, who rolled his eyes and then proceeded to give an e-cig to Nataly. ''A bet on whether ya would forget about ours visit to George and Timothea. Miss Nataly said ya definitely would, but I wasn't sure. Seems like I'd better not underestimate Miss Nataly's knowledge about you from now.'' A small smile crept onto Viktor's mouth as he finished his sentence. It seemed fake to Martin, even though he'd known him for only a better part of two weeks. He'd forgotten all about this coffee time he promised, but could hardly back out now. The schematics could wait an hour or two.

Shrugging his shoulders, he put on his boots and followed them out. A coffee would serve him well.

Timothea and George were both as lively as ever, chatting about everything and anything, making fun of one another, and generally being good hosts. He missed the smell of coffee that permeated their room, mixed in with the smell of old books. Their room was super tidy, more than his had ever been. The only room he'd seen that was as clean as this one was Nataly's, and she was a huge cleanliness freak.

George laughed about something Martin had overheard and tapped Viktor's shoulder. ''So that's what you've been doing, boy? You know that you won't get to take Eva out by just working yourself to death, right?''

Viktor became red as a pepper, swallowing whatever he'd been about to say. After a while, he went to retort, his voice raised in visible embarrassment. ''It's not like that with me and Dr. Eva, ya old bastard. She's just a good doc.''

Timothea laughed. ''And that's why you went to visit her almost every day last week? We ain't blind, Viktor. And we know Eva well. We could help you out.''

To Martin's surprise, even Nataly seemed excited about the prospect. How did these women get so excited about love gossip when the stakes were as high as they were? Sure, Timothea wasn't privy to all details, but Nataly was.

*Well, it's not like her own love life is full of intrigue. Not until I finally man up.* How cowardly was he to still deny his feelings towards her? He'd have to come forward clean to her one day soon. If only there wasn't the risk they'd both die in the next few months, or weeks even.

After they finished talking about Viktor's love life, he'd excused himself for a moment and gone out of the room, saying that he needed to clear his head a bit. Finally, a chance to talk came. Martin didn't hesitate. He got on his legs, excused himself, and stepped out as well. Viktor was right outside of the room, leaning on a black wall, his head lowered. He didn't notice Martin until he stood right beside him.

''Hey, Vik. How are you holding up?'' Martin talked calmly, trying to sound as reassuring as possible. He didn't think of himself as the best talker, but he'd do his best. He would want a friend to do the same if the situation were reversed.

Viktor looked up, finally registering who exactly was standing next to him, and exhaled through his teeth. Martin had finally replaced them yesterday, and his face was already looking better, more solid than before. He'd even call Viktor handsome, a different kind of handsome than the elegant way Damian was, but handsome anyway. Or maybe he'd do that after a haircut.

''I'm good, Martin.'' A short pause. ''Thanks though.''

As if he'd let that stop him. He wanted him to understand that he wasn't alone. He wouldn't let him go until he made sure that he was. ''No, you're not. Listen, I understand you. I went through something similar a few years ago. I...''

Anger replaced Viktor's expression, the most rigid emotion Martin had seen on Viktor's face until now. ''Ya don't understand jack-shit, Martin. Ya didn't lose your only family to some robotic fucks, thinking that your fam went somewhere and were livin' their best life somewhere. That they forgot about you. Ya don't know how it is, to hope that they'll return. To hope, just for that hope to be squashed like a bug.''

Martin stopped, feelings of surprise and anger mixing in. He collected himself, though. No point in making this a heated debate. He was trying to help. ''I do know how it feels to lose family to them, Vik. I don't know about the other parts, but...''

Viktor interrupted him again, even angrier now than before. ''I'm not dumb, Martin. Everyone lost family to this city. But ya knew they were in the ground. And ya life? Ya mannerisms? The way ya talk? I know that ya don't know jack about living in the outer city. The life ya had didn't go to shits because of what ya lost.'' He pushed himself off the wall, staring up into Martin's eyes now. ''I know ya want to help me, but right now, ya sound like a hypocraial shit-eater to me.''

''Hippocritical,'' Martin said before even thinking, the correction slipping on his tongue. He was at a loss for words. Was that how he seemed to him?

Viktor deflated, some of the anger leaving him, and then he shook his head. He no longer looked into Martin's eyes. ''Imma be in the lab.''

And with that, he left, leaving Martin standing there, still processing what had just happened.

After a while, the door to George's room opened, and Nataly stepped out, quickly looking around. ''So, he left?''

Martin just put a hand on his head, feeling abashed. How bad did Viktor have it in life? He'd not considered that he would come off as... condescending to him.

''Yeah. Probably for the better. Tried to help but...'' He just shrugged his shoulders.

Nataly stepped closer, the door closing behind her, and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently. ''It's okay, Martin. He'll come around. He knows that you wanted to help, you'll see.''

He put his hand over hers, locking it in place, and thought for a bit. ''Yeah, I hope so. Think he needs more time?''

A nod. ''Yes. Give him some space, and he'll come around, probably apologize. You really do dash into action without thinking sometimes, though. I'll have to hammer out that habit of yours sometime.''

Martin just chuckled at that, and Nataly gave him a playful smile in return, the lights of the hall reflecting off her full lips that were painted with glossy black lipstick.

''Now come, unless you want your coffee to get cold. George will kill you if you ask for a new one.'' And with that, they entered. If only all of Martin's worries could be solved with just a cup of coffee.",1,1756153506.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

 This year’s model is *bigger and better*! And by bigger, I mean smaller, and by better, I actually do mean better. If you think it looks suspiciously like a manual coffee grinder, don’t be fooled! …Well okay, it basically is, but with some key modifications to make it less grindy and more threshy. Functionally, it’s simple: I add basil pods in the top, turn the finger crank, and out the bottom come seeds and husks. There’s some mechanical mumbo jumbo happening in between, but that’s not really important.

The upgrade this year is an adjustment option! I can twist the top section to set the spacing between the inner and outer burrs. Too tight and I get aromatic seed powder, too loose and I’m just moving intact pods from top to bottom. But once I found the right middle ground, the seeds separated cleanly and without damage. This also *should* make it usable for other seed types. In theory… It’s a solid theory…But I’m leaving the experimental confirmation of that to others if they are interested, I already hit my testing motivation limit.

Next on my to do list is a trommel-style cleaner to separate seed from chaff. Last year I tried to combine threshing and cleaning in one tool, but it wasn’t very effective or adjustable. This time I’m making it a dedicated tool. Ideally it will be compact, adjustable for different seeds, and fully 3D printed. After that, I’ll revisit my seed sorter. The one I built last year works, but it’s big, tricky to print, and over complicated to operate.",2,1756153209.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

I’ve got a question about dating that’s been on my mind. Why is it so hard to find a solid partner these days?:(

So recently I matched with a guy on a dating app. We texted a bit and he suggested we meet up right away. I figured, why waste weeks messaging if it might not click in person? We went for a walk around my neighborhood, talked for hours and honestly there was a spark.

Second date he invited me over for dinner, which felt too soon, so I told him that. He was totally fine with it and suggested another walk instead. We ended up in his area, stayed out until late just talking again. No intimacy yet, except some looks, but good vibes overall.

Last week he had family visiting, so we didn’t meet up, but he texted me every day with updates and pictures, which I liked. Now his family’s gone and I asked if we want to see ea h other again this week, to which he agreed. He suggested we meet in a couple of days after work (he’s a lawyer working in Court and has a big deadline). around 8pm. He was sorry that he couldn’t make it earlier due to his deadline. I just said that’s fine with me bc I don’t expect anything big and he told me about his deadline early on it’s nothing new and I know since his family stayed for the week, he couldn’t work on it. I just want to see him again and spend some time with him.

Here’s my thing: I don’t just want to be someone he casually fits in between work and life. I’d like us to actually do something and get to know each other more intentionally, not just walk around all the time.

He’s been consistent with sharing about his life, but he doesn’t ask much about me – I usually share something aswell if he does and that keeps the convo going. Not sure if that says anything, or if I’m overthinking.

Was it a mistake to agree to another date this late? Or should I’ve said no and wait until his work is done? It’s due on the 8th of September btw. Especially curious what guys think about this. 
If he suggests to go on a walk again I will ask to go for a coffee instead or to the movies

1n01eaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1n01eaa/the_great_alone_by_kristin_hannah/,The Great Alone By Kristin Hannah,"Hey everyone! I just finished reading **[The Great Alone By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/the-great-alone-by-kristin-hannah/)**, and wow, it really left an impression on me. If you’re looking for a book that pulls you into a completely different world and doesn't let go, this might be it. I wanted to share my thoughts, as if we were just chatting over coffee, and maybe offer a few tips for those of you new to these kinds of intense reads!

***

### What's It All About (No Spoilers, Promise!)

""The Great Alone"" takes us back to the 1970s and introduces us to the Allbright family: a teenage daughter, Leni; her mother, Cora; and her Vietnam veteran father, Ernt. After Ernt returns from the war deeply changed and struggles with PTSD, he decides to uproot the family to the untamed wilderness of Alaska. They're seeking a fresh start, hoping the isolation will heal him and bring them closer. But as winter closes in, cutting them off from the outside world, the dream of freedom quickly turns into a struggle for survival against both nature's harshness and the growing darkness within their own home. It’s a story about resilience, love, and what it truly means to endure.

***

### What I Really Liked

Honestly, there was so much to appreciate here.

*   **The Characters:** Leni, the young protagonist, is incredibly brave and resourceful. Watching her grow up in such extreme circumstances, facing incredibly difficult choices, was captivating. Her mother, Cora, also undergoes a profound transformation. Even Ernt, despite his flaws, is a complex character you sometimes pity, sometimes fear. Their struggles felt incredibly real.
*   **The Setting:** Alaska itself is practically a character in this book. Hannah's descriptions of the wilderness – its beauty, its brutality, its isolating power – are just stunning. You can almost feel the cold, hear the wind, and smell the pine trees. It made me feel like I was right there with them, trying to build a life in that wild, unforgiving land.
*   **The Emotions:** This book is a rollercoaster of feelings. It's intense, heartbreaking, and at times, hopeful. It tackles really heavy themes like domestic abuse, mental health, and the sheer will to survive. Hannah doesn't shy away from the hard stuff, making you feel every punch, every fear, and every small victory.
*   **The Pacing:** While it's a deep character study, the story also has a great sense of urgency. The short chapters and escalating tension kept me turning pages late into the night.

***

### What I Found Challenging (It's Not for Everyone)

While I truly enjoyed it, I want to be honest: this isn't a light or easy read.

*   **The Intensity:** Because it deals with such difficult topics, there are moments that are genuinely tough to read. If you’re sensitive to themes of abuse and trauma, you should definitely approach this with caution. It’s a powerful story, but it demands emotional investment.
*   **The Predictability (Sometimes):** In some aspects, the story follows certain narrative arcs you might expect from a survival or coming-of-age tale. However, the emotional depth and character work more than make up for any familiar plot points.

***

### Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?

Yes, I absolutely would recommend **[The Great Alone By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/the-great-alone-by-kristin-hannah/)**, but with a clear understanding of what you're getting into. This book is perfect for:

*   Readers who love immersive, atmospheric stories.
*   Anyone who appreciates strong character development and complex family dynamics.
*   Those interested in survival stories and the power of the human spirit.
*   Fans of psychological fiction who don't mind a challenging, emotional journey.

If you're looking for a lighthearted escape, this probably isn't it. But if you're ready to be moved and captivated, dive in!

***

### A Little Guide for New Readers (Especially for Thrillers/Psychological Fiction/Fantasy!)

For those of you just dipping your toes into more intense genres like thrillers, psychological fiction, or even complex fantasy, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start with Something That Hooks You:** Find a book with a premise that genuinely excites you. If the summary (like for ""The Great Alone"") grabs your attention, that's a great sign!
2.  **Embrace the Immersion:** These genres often create rich worlds or deep character psyches. Let yourself get lost in the details and the atmosphere. Don't be afraid to feel what the characters feel.
3.  **Take Breaks if You Need To:** If a book gets too intense or confusing, it's totally okay to put it down for a bit. Read a chapter, then take a walk. Give your mind space to process. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore!
4.  **Don't Be Afraid of the ""Heavy"" Stuff:** Many powerful stories explore difficult themes. These books can often teach us a lot about the human experience, even when it's uncomfortable. Just remember to practice self-care while reading.
5.  **Talk About It!** Once you finish a book, share your thoughts! Discussing it with friends or online communities (like here on Reddit!) can help you process your feelings and discover new insights.

***

So, there you have it. **[The Great Alone By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/the-great-alone-by-kristin-hannah/)** is a powerful read that will stay with you long after you've finished the last page. I truly hope you consider picking it up if it sounds like your cup of tea. Happy reading, everyone!",1,1756153047.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

You go on the Military subs, everyones a lieutenant or captain married to a hot blonde & drives a 2024 F250, nobody’s a PFC or Private that has to walk to chow hall, chain smokes cigarettes and binge drinks Monster’s..

And then dont even get started on romance, everyone’s been married 15+ years on this app to the love of their life that they met inside a coffee shop on the middle of a calm autumn Sunday sipping a pumpkin latte, and oh yeah their alleged wife/husband is almost always a 10/10. The husbands always 6 foot something, 220 solid. The wife is always 5’5, and “thick in all the right places”

Lying on the internet has become sensationalized and I feel like due to the ability to maintain anonymity on this app specifically makes Reddit a hot spot for the unreal stories.",7,1756152771.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,16,0.71,False
