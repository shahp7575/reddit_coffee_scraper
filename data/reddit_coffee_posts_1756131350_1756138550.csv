1mzuq4g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzuq4g,1963 Studebaker Lark Daytona Convertible: The Underdog Muscle-Lite Drop Top You Forgot Existed,"**TL;DR:**  
The *1963 Studebaker Lark Daytona Convertible* is one of the last gasps of an independent American automaker trying to stay relevant. Sporting a 259 V8 and the 2-speed Flight-O-Matic auto, this sporty little convertible aimed at the Big Three's compacts like the Falcon Sprint and Corvair Monza. Today, it‚Äôs an underappreciated gem with serious nostalgic and collectible value.

When most people think about the early ‚Äò60s American compacts, names like the **Ford Falcon**, **Chevy Corvair**, and **Plymouth Valiant** come to mind. But in the middle of all that Detroit dominance, **Studebaker**‚Äîthe oldest surviving American vehicle manufacturer at the time‚Äîwas doing everything it could to keep pace.

And the **1963 Lark Daytona Convertible** was a valiant effort (pun intended) to inject some excitement and flair into the Studebaker lineup.

# üèÅ The ‚ÄúDaytona‚Äù Trim: Studebaker‚Äôs Shot at Sporty Cool

The **Daytona** badge was Studebaker‚Äôs attempt to capture the emerging youth market. Offered as both a hardtop and a convertible, the Daytona was the *sporty* Lark‚Äîcomplete with bucket seats, bold exterior trim, and more powerful engine options.

In this case, the **259ci V8**, paired with the **Flight-O-Matic 2-speed automatic**, gave respectable performance for the compact segment. Horsepower hovered around **180 hp**, and while it wasn‚Äôt a fire-breather, it offered smooth cruising and more punch than the standard inline-6.

# üõ†Ô∏è Design & Production: South Bend's Last Hurrah

* **Manufactured in South Bend, Indiana**, the 1963 Lark Daytona marked a design refresh by *Brooks Stevens*‚Äîthe same industrial designer behind the Jeep Wagoneer and Harley-Davidson styling.
* Studebaker aimed to make the Lark look more modern without spending a fortune. The grille, tail lights, and side moldings were reshaped for a sleeker, more updated look.
* Only **1,809 Lark Daytona Convertibles** were built in 1963, making it a **relatively rare car today**, especially compared to the Falcon Sprint or Corvair Monza convertibles of the same year.

# üèéÔ∏è What It Was Competing Against

The Lark Daytona was squarely targeted at the Big Three‚Äôs sporty compacts:

* **Ford Falcon Sprint** (especially with the 260 V8)
* **Chevy Corvair Monza Spyder**
* **Plymouth Valiant Signet 200**

But unlike those, the Daytona came from an independent automaker with far fewer resources and a smaller dealer network. Still, it held its own with decent power, attractive styling, and a lower purchase price.

# üí´ The Oddball Appeal and Who Loved It

People who bought a Studebaker in 1963 weren‚Äôt going with the flow‚Äîthey were bucking the norm. The Lark Daytona appealed to those who didn‚Äôt want something from Ford or GM. That contrarian streak is part of why these cars are still loved today.

Some pockets of the Studebaker fandom have kept the flame alive‚Äîsmall but mighty clubs, regional shows, and classic car lovers who appreciate the underdogs of automotive history.

# üìà Investment Potential and Future Value

Because of its **low production numbers**, unique place in American automotive history, and the fact that it was part of **Studebaker‚Äôs final few years in the U.S.**, the **1963 Lark Daytona Convertible** is slowly gaining appreciation in the collector market.

They're still **undervalued compared to Mustangs or Falcons**, but that‚Äôs what makes them a potential smart buy. Clean, original or well-restored examples are already bringing decent money at auction, and rarity will only push that trend upward.

This isn't just a quirky classic‚Äîit's a slice of American industrial struggle, innovation, and design savvy on a shoestring budget.

1mzuppg,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mzuppg/should_you_buy_the_greenlife_3in1_breakfast_maker/,Should You Buy the GreenLife 3-in-1 Breakfast Maker Review for Busy Mornings?,"Testing kitchen gadgets is always an adventure for me, and recently I had the pleasure of using the **GreenLife CC006797-001 3-in-1 Breakfast Maker Station**. I‚Äôve tried a ton of small appliances over the years, but this one intrigued me from the start. A breakfast maker that‚Äôs compact, multi-functional, and visually appealing in its cheerful turquoise hue? I couldn‚Äôt resist putting it through its paces. Over the last few weeks, it‚Äôs been my go-to appliance for rushed mornings‚Äîbringing convenience and versatility, though not without some quirks.

**Intuitive Design**

At first glance, the sleek and uncomplicated design caught my attention. The dual griddle compartments and a toast drawer tucked underneath create a streamlined look. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit comfortably on even the smallest of kitchen countertops, making it ideal for tight spaces. Plus, the vibrant turquoise color adds a nice pop of personality to the kitchen. The inclusion of a sturdy base with rubber feet ensures it doesn‚Äôt slide around, even when I‚Äôm busy flipping eggs and bacon on the griddles. While I do appreciate its compact footprint, the height of the appliance does make it slightly challenging to store in my particularly small cabinets‚Äîsomething to keep in mind if space is a concern.

**Versatile Cooking Performance**

This little powerhouse offers a multi-functional cooking experience that I wasn‚Äôt expecting from such a compact gadget. The dual upper griddles allow me to whip up pancakes on one side while frying eggs on the other. It‚Äôs a time-saver, especially on mornings when my family seems to have bottomless appetites. Meanwhile, the toast drawer beneath handles up to two slices of bread effortlessly. I‚Äôve even experimented with slightly larger sandwich bread, and while it doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly, it still toasts quite well. The griddle compartments heat up quickly, which really impressed me, but maintaining even heat across the surface proved to be a minor issue. Pancakes cooked evenly in the center, but the edges tended to lag behind, so I found myself shifting food around for consistency. 

**Cleaning Made Easy**

One of my favorite features has to be the ceramic nonstick coating. I‚Äôm borderline obsessive when it comes to cleanup, and this product passed the test. Eggs, melted cheese, and even pancake batter slid right off with a damp cloth and a splash of dish soap. The nonstick surface is also free of PFAS, PFOA, lead, and cadmium, which eases any health concerns about cooking on harmful coatings. Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt even need to soak the toast drawer after an overly zealous experiment with buttery garlic toast. That said, the lack of removable griddle plates is a bit of a drawback. Cleaning the upper compartments without accidentally splashing the controls requires patience and precision.

**Key Benefits**

- Compact, space-saving design fits well in small kitchens.
- Dual griddle system allows for multitasking while cooking.
- Ceramic nonstick coating ensures effortless cleanup.
- Cheerful turquoise color adds a fun flair to kitchen decor.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Heat distribution on griddle compartments could be more even.
- Non-removable components make thorough cleaning tricky.
- Toast drawer struggles with accommodating certain bread sizes.

**Safety Features and Usability**

Using this breakfast maker daily, I fully appreciated its thoughtful safety features. The cool-touch handles made it easy for me to check on the food without burning my hands, and I bet even kids eager to help in the kitchen could use this safely (with supervision, of course). The glass lid boasts a steam vent, letting me peek at my cooking progress. However, I noticed the lid fogs up more often than expected, which slightly takes away from its ""cook and look"" convenience. Another strong point is the built-in timer that eliminates the guesswork from meal prep, though it is slightly quieter than I‚Äôd prefer‚Äîleading to a couple of near-burnt slices of toast during my early experiments!

**Competitive Options**

With so many multi-functional kitchen appliances on the market, it‚Äôs worth comparing this with some competitors. Products like the **Cuisinart 5-in-1 Griddler** and **Nostalgia Retro 3-in-1 Breakfast Station** come to mind. The Griddler offers a more extensive temperature control system and detachable plates, making it easier to clean, while Nostalgia‚Äôs station has a coffee maker in its setup‚Äîhandy for the caffeine-driven among us. However, the GreenLife breakfast maker sets itself apart through its health-focused ceramic nonstick coating and an even friendlier compact design, which may appeal more to individuals prioritizing simplicity and counter space over additional features.

**Money's Worth**

One of the most important considerations for a small appliance like this is whether it offers strong value for its price. While I refrain from quoting specific figures due to varying discounts and deals, it‚Äôs safe to say this breakfast station delivers decent bang-for-the-buck. Instead of pulling out three or four different kitchen gadgets to handle eggs, toast, and pancakes, this appliance does it all in one go. Pantry-constrained households or those living in apartments with limited space might find it particularly economical. Sure, there are a few nitpicks like uneven heat, but for the convenience and multi-functionality it offers, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to say it‚Äôs a worthy investment.

And what did you do to prep for your FET?,"I‚Äôm waiting for my period so my FET cycle to start and I‚Äôm starting to get overwhelmed with decisions to make. I ovulate regularly on my own and have always had good lining thickness and trilaminar pattern. My RE said that I can do either a natural or modified natural with letrozole and it‚Äôs ultimately up to me. I‚Äôm a little nervous about messing things up with letrozole, the one time I did use it for an IUI was a rescue cycle where I didn‚Äôt ovulate that cycle and my lining was not trilaminar. I don‚Äôt think it was due to letrozole but I also don‚Äôt know for sure. 

If I don‚Äôt have to add extra medication with side effects that would be ideal but if there are actual benefits and increased success rates with letrozole then I will take it. What would you do??

Also what other things can I do now to better prep for my FET? Supplements to take or avoid? Should I cut out my morning cup of coffee? Should I have unprotected sex the day before FET?

And my mental disorder like my mind was not severe at those times and I have stoped cursing, but after many years I am not sure If I am truly saved I do believed in Jesus Christ and His finished work on my behalf, I also have experienced a answered prayer where I want a devotional book to help me and later that night a sister in the faith just chatted me
saying, Hello brother, do you want a devotional a book? I have an extra here,
and her testimony is she was keep thinking of the devotional book that she left in her house.
Many days have past I still have that OCD and is worsening and I was at prayer meeting and it was evening I heard my mind saying satan will enter into you and there I panic and I smelled a phantom smell like a smoke smell,(even until now especially when I am so anxious) and I was panicking and calling to Jesus that time to help me Lord help me and after that service I went back to my home and I was so thirsty and I have drink like 3 bottles of water I still feel the thirst and I was really afraid that time.
I have also experienced backslide because of problems that is in me and my family and I regretted that time, and I became rebellious to God and bitter and being offended of the truth and as I am returning to God I have a dream where I feel like I am possessed by satan and many dreams like my uncle is possessed and that night that gives me a panic and I feel like I am losing myself fearing being possess and I also feel dizzy.
And now it gets worser there is a side to me that wants to share the Gospel and other side doesn‚Äôt want to and it condemns my family and me and doesn‚Äôt want people to hear the Gospel and it is my thought and I feel like I am the one speaking it and I can feel it and I hate that thought, and I wanted to trust in Christ Jesus alone but this feelings of unbelief‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt want to and blasphemous thoughts and I also experienced in my past that saying I cannot be forgiven because of what I have done, even til now I want to repent but I cannot I feel like when I want to repent there is an urge in me to laugh like mocking God, and like in my heart that worships the devil and I hate it, and I have a distorted view of Christ Jesus and God.
I also struggled like I love sin more than God and I hate this feeling of loving sin and I struggled with my conscience toward sin like I feel numb and feel happy and I hate this with pure hatred of feeling happy to sin, I cried and I have prayed this a lot of times and I have fast for just 1hr 20mins giving my cares to God, and this distorted view of Jesus Christ in my past I have believed that He is God and now my mind is like twisting things like Jesus is evil and Jesus is just a man and having I feel like when I read the Bible I feel like I have this other version of Christ and I don‚Äôt want it, I want the Biblical Christ Jesus and I really do wanted to trust Him and He be Lord and my Master I am doubting my salvation til now.

The worst thing is that yesterday I went 20h without sleep, then went to sleep at 3 in the afternoon. Slept for 2h and I'm feeling fine. I do notice slight drop in cognitive function. 

This is going to backfire sooner or later.
I stopped drinking coffee. Melatonin does jack shit. I've tried to fix my sleep schedule. Sunlight exposure in the morning also nothing.

 At night my mind keeps racing and it's getting on my nerves. Which just makes me more anxious.

Two detectives try to uncover the truth of what happened to Sandy cheeks in a dramatic detective story called the sandy files‚Ä¶ Episodes one and two.

Episode one of the sandy files. Title ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù

[INT. NYPD HOMICIDE UNIT ‚Äì LATE NIGHT. A flickering fluorescent bulb hums overhead. Detective JEFF, grizzled, chain-smoking, with coffee stains on his shirt, stares at his computer. His partner JOHN, younger, more rational, sits nearby flipping through real case files.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: (squinting at the screen) ‚Ä¶What the hell is this?

JOHN: Another AI screw-up?

JEFF: No. Bigger. Much bigger. (points at the monitor) Look at this.

JOHN: (leans over) ‚Ä¶You just Googled ‚Äúhow does Sandy die in SpongeBob‚Äù?

JEFF: Exactly. And the AI overview says she died in Johannesburg. Cocaine toxicity, alcohol in her bloodstream, heroin. Cuts on her arms.

JOHN: Jeff. Jeff, buddy. That‚Äôs a cartoon squirrel. With a spacesuit. From Texas.

JEFF: Don‚Äôt you get it?! That‚Äôs exactly what they want you to think. It‚Äôs the perfect cover. Nickelodeon‚Äôs been hiding something.

JOHN: (facepalms) Oh god. Not another conspiracy.

JEFF: Listen, John. You think it‚Äôs a coincidence this ‚Äúautopsy report‚Äù lines up with the Johannesburg Police Department? Sandy‚Äôs been living underwater for years, and now suddenly she‚Äôs found in South Africa with enough heroin to kill an elephant? This is no fan fiction, this is a cover-up.

JOHN: It literally says ‚ÄúSpongeBob Fanon Wiki.‚Äù That‚Äôs like Wikipedia, but for made-up nonsense.

JEFF: Or it‚Äôs where whistleblowers leak the truth when Big Media won‚Äôt print it.

JOHN: You‚Äôve officially lost it.

‚∏ª

[Jeff slams his desk dramatically. Papers fly everywhere.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: Pack your bags. We‚Äôre going to Johannesburg.

JOHN: ‚Ä¶Excuse me?

JEFF: We‚Äôll talk to the police. Pull the autopsy file. Find the toxicology report.

JOHN: Jeff. It‚Äôs a squirrel. From a cartoon.

JEFF: Or it‚Äôs the body double of a squirrel, replaced in Bikini Bottom so the truth never gets out.

JOHN: ‚Ä¶That sentence made me dumber just hearing it.

JEFF: Think about it. SpongeBob‚Äôs been running for decades. How? Characters never age. Never die. Unless‚Äî (leans closer, whispering) ‚Äîthey‚Äôre hiding the bodies in Johannesburg.

JOHN: (sighs, pinches the bridge of his nose) I went to law school for this?

‚∏ª

[Jeff grabs his trench coat, lights another cigarette, and storms toward the door.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: You coming or not, John?

JOHN: ‚Ä¶This is ridiculous.

JEFF: That‚Äôs what they said about Watergate. That‚Äôs what they said about Area 51. And now, Sandy Cheeks.

JOHN: (pauses, defeated) ‚Ä¶Fine. But when we get there, and the cops laugh us out of the precinct, I‚Äôm blaming you.

JEFF: Good man. Grab the passports. Nickelodeon can‚Äôt bury this one.

‚∏ª

[They exit. The camera lingers on the glowing AI overview on Jeff‚Äôs computer screen: ‚ÄúAccording to the SpongeBob Fanon Wiki, Sandy Cheeks died by suicide on July 14‚Ä¶‚Äù Dramatic music swells.]

‚∏ª

NARRATOR (gritty trailer voice):
‚ÄúTwo detectives. One cartoon squirrel. And a conspiracy bigger than Bikini Bottom itself.‚Äù

Episode two of the sandy files. Title ‚Äúthe second autopsy‚Äù

[INT. JOHANNESBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT ‚Äì DAY. The office is bustling. JEFF and JOHN walk in, jetlagged and sweaty. Behind a massive desk sits CHIEF SIYABONGA, a broad-shouldered man in his 50s, sipping tea and reading case files. He looks up as the detectives approach.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: (slamming his badge on the desk) Detective Jeff Donnelly, NYPD Homicide. We‚Äôre here about‚Ä¶ Sandy Cheeks.

JOHN: (groaning, under his breath) Oh my god, Jeff, don‚Äôt just‚Äî

CHIEF SIYABONGA: (puts down his tea slowly, narrows his eyes) ‚Ä¶Follow me.

JOHN: (double-takes) Wait‚Äîwhat? That actually worked?!

JEFF: (smirking, whispering to John) Told you, kid. The truth is never blunt, it‚Äôs just sharp enough to cut.

‚∏ª

[They follow Siyabonga down a dimly lit hallway. The echo of their footsteps bounces off the tiled walls until they enter an AUTOPSY ROOM. A small body lies under a white sheet on a steel table. Siyabonga pulls the sheet back.]

‚∏ª

CHIEF SIYABONGA: This‚Ä¶ is how we found her.

[Under the sheet is a small squirrel, stiff, lifeless, with a furry tail hanging off the edge of the table.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: (gasps, steps back dramatically, covers John‚Äôs eyes) Don‚Äôt look, lad. You‚Äôre too young for this kind of trauma.

JOHN: (rips Jeff‚Äôs hand away, shouting) That‚Äôs a NORMAL squirrel! A regular woodland squirrel!

JEFF: (ignores him, leaning close to Siyabonga) Why Johannesburg, Chief? Why here?

CHIEF SIYABONGA: (gravely, shaking his head) We do not know.

JOHN: Because it‚Äôs just a squirrel! A squirrel that probably fell out of a tree and died like any other squirrel!

JEFF: No. (lights a cigarette in the autopsy room, despite the ‚ÄúNO SMOKING‚Äù sign) She was running from something. Something she saw down in Bikini Bottom. Something that broke her. And when she ran‚Ä¶ she ran here.

CHIEF SIYABONGA: (solemnly nodding) Into the substances.

JEFF: Exactly.

JOHN: Into the‚Äî ARE YOU BOTH HEARING YOURSELVES RIGHT NOW?!

‚∏ª

[Jeff pulls on a pair of latex gloves, dramatically snaps them on, and grabs a scalpel.]

‚∏ª

JOHN: Wait wait wait‚ÄîJeff, no! You can‚Äôt just‚Äî

JEFF: (already hunched over the squirrel) We‚Äôll need to perform a secondary autopsy. Can‚Äôt trust the first one. Nickelodeon‚Äôs fingerprints are all over this.

CHIEF SIYABONGA: (gravely) We suspected as much.

JOHN: Oh my god.

‚∏ª

[Montage of Jeff performing an over-the-top ‚Äúautopsy‚Äù: poking the squirrel with tweezers, holding up a tiny rib bone like it‚Äôs evidence, squinting at fur samples under a magnifying glass he bought from a gift shop. John paces in the background, muttering.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: (writing furiously in his notebook) Cause of death: escape trauma. Catalyst: unresolved Bikini Bottom incident. Final descent: alcohol, cocaine, heroin cocktail.

JOHN: Jeff. You just dissected a squirrel that probably ate bad trash.

JEFF: Don‚Äôt be naive. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúbad trash,‚Äù kid. That‚Äôs the lifestyle of a broken genius.

CHIEF SIYABONGA: (nodding like a wise sage) She was chasing her demons.

JOHN: SHE‚ÄôS A CARTOON!

‚∏ª

[LATER ‚Äì INT. HOTEL ROOM, JOHANNESBURG. Jeff and John sit at a table covered with papers, the squirrel autopsy report, and an empty minibar bottle.]

‚∏ª

JEFF: (chain-smoking, staring at the evidence) It‚Äôs all here. Trauma drove her out. Substances dragged her down. Now the only question is‚Äîwhat happened in Bikini Bottom that made her run?

JOHN: (hands in his hair, pacing) Jeff, we are in South Africa. We flew across the ocean. We did an autopsy on a random squirrel. And now you‚Äôre asking about SpongeBob like he‚Äôs a mob boss.

JEFF: (leans back, blowing smoke toward the ceiling) Kid, SpongeBob‚Äôs been smiling for twenty years straight. Nobody smiles that long without hiding something.

JOHN: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done. I quit. I can‚Äôt do this anymore.

JEFF: No, John. You‚Äôre in this now. We both are. (dramatic pause) Once you look into Sandy‚Äôs eyes‚Ä¶ you never go back.

JOHN: (screaming into a pillow) AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

I have an older(31M) brother who my dad has always preferred. My dad has made it clear by always spending much more time with him, bonding and taking interest in what my brother does. When I was about 15 my dad screamed at me at a family 4th of July party because I told him to stop lighting fireworks so close to cars. He screamed at me so much my aunt had to take me home in the middle of the night. I remember waking up on my dad‚Äôs day off and making coffee/breakfast and cleaning the house. When my dad came out to the kitchen his first words to me were, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs your brother?‚Äù. Fast forward to when I‚Äôm 18. My dad started a meth induced affair. This ended my parents 26 year marriage and left my mom without anything, no house, no car nothing. My mom lived with me, I got her and car and a job. My mom is my best friend. I of course lashed out against my dad. However over the years I gave him chances to reconnect and build the relationship. I had a daughter in 2023. He came to the hospital to see her, but in 2 1/2 years he‚Äôs seen my daughter maybe 5 times. When he‚Äôs in town(he lives about 2 hours away) he texts me saying he‚Äôs at my brothers and would like to visit. I need to mentally prepare for his visits because it drains me talking to him. He ALWAYS calls on Tuesday saying he‚Äôll be in town Sunday and then never hear from him. Or he‚Äôll just randomly show up at my brothers and expect I‚Äôm free/able to visit. I‚Äôve explained to him 1,000 times that I can‚Äôt do last minute visits, that he needs to follow through with plans. I explained that my partner and I have busy schedules and I need to set aside time. He has never respected boundary and blames me for not making an effort. I finally have come to the point where I don‚Äôt want a relationship with him. He brings nothing to my life and I refuse to let him disappoint my daughter the way he has me. We got into a text argument the other day where he told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a shitty thing you‚Äôre doing‚Äù and I was so enraged that I posted a screenshot of it on my story so his family could understand why I don‚Äôt have a relationship with him. My brother messaged me saying that it was ‚Äúcringe‚Äù and that I need to fix our relationship. So I‚Äôm stuck.

It's so euphoric, i can do everything i want, relax after work in my couch listening to music, chill with my girlfriend and connect so nice, eating, watch a movie, go out to take a walk...

I do this 2/3 times a week.

And when i have something social, like a party in a friends house, i take 5mg diazepam, max 10, i add it at the same time as kratom. Just a few times a month.

1: dress: I like colors and patterns, but I‚Äôd say my usual style is pretty basic, tshirt, jeans , flannel or sweaters.

3: anime: haikyu I played volleyball as a kid with my friends and always wanted to be a real player but my parents never let me join a team.

4: study: I was in dental school, but dropped out for health reasons. Now I study mental illness for fun and to help people who struggle.

11 place: the woods/mountains. Especially near water. I like the quiet.

12: Hobbies : see above. Also taking random tests like what pizza am I ?

13: music: these are some of my favorites, but I love anything that has a true meaning behind it, lyrics I can feel. Also, classical music or fantasy music.

14 cartoon: snoopy, it‚Äôs nostalgic.

15 manwha: no idea what that really is, but I think a comic if some sort. Gabriel piccolos books are the closest I‚Äôve gotten to reading comics.

18: Animal: Tigers- they are baby, just big kitties that I want to squish their floofy faces!

And I have PDA.

I learnt to manage autism, i have noise cancelling headphones, stim toys, which help me with my axciety, friends who are neurodivergent, people around me like to talk about my special interests, i have clothes that are comfortable, AC, good soft blankets, weighted plushies, everything i could ask for.
But unfortunately i have PDA and that, i cant deal with. For example today i realized my room was a mess (i live with my parents, i am in uni still). Important info: my room has been a mess for only 1 day. I realized this and decided to start cleaning today. But when i came down to drink coffee, my mom told me to ""get my shit together and clean my room, asap"".

Now i took my mom to my appointments. She knows. I talked to her countless times. After every talk she is okay for a while, and starts doing it again after a week or so. These ""talks"" always end up as arguements.
I cant begin to tell you what it felt like when my mother told to me clean my room. The worst part: she repeated herself 3 times to ""remind me"".

I feel so much rage i thought i was going to destroy my room. I want to cry, and i almost threw up. I want to punch something, scream and idk.

She doesnt get it. She is acting like im dramatic, she rolls her eyes, says ""okay okay"" while doing it, and sighs every single time. It doesnt help. I am not a violent person, ive never hurt anyone but in times like these i could throw the whole table at her.

Does anyone have any tips? Anything to make me less angry or how to do the tasks after this happen? Some trick to make me think the control is mine? I dont know what to do anymore.

Edit: important to know right now i cant work, i struggle with work, but also im in uni and cant afford to move. Im stuck with my parents until i finish uni which can take years",2,1756136847.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1mzu36x,https://www.reddit.com/r/haiti/comments/1mzu36x/answering_the_age_old_question_what_would_you_do/,Answering the age old question: What would you do if you were president? Critique my answer.,"If I were president, I would not try to retake PAP right away. I would contain the gangs there while rebuilding the rest of Haiti, then make the capital irrelevant through economic strangulation.

First, I would bring in foreign forces to contain the gangs in PAP. They do not need to win, only stop them from spreading. Kenya's troops, plus private contractors and whoever else is willing. Their job is containment, not victory. Create a stalemate that buys us time. But simultaneously, I would secure Cap Haitien, Les Cayes, Jacmel, and Gonaives first. These cities are manageable and can prove our approach works. Connect them with safe corridors for commerce while we build capacity elsewhere. (Containing gangs in PAP while proving success elsewhere)

Second, I would hold a national draft targeting 0.5-0.8% of Haitians nationally and worldwide, around 60,000 to 90,000 people. It would be voluntary, but salaries, housing, food, training, and citizenship would be given. About 20,000 would become police and security forces trained by countries that know how to build armies fast, like Rwanda, El Salvador, and Burkina Faso. Some would support foreign forces in PAP. Others would secure borders and clear smaller gangs in rural areas that block transportation and choke the economy. Another 40,000 would join civilian reconstruction teams working on infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing in secured zones. The rest would be administrators, trainers, and technical specialists. We would take on debt to pay for logistics and training, around $500-700 million annually with countries and organizations that see real progress in our secured cities. (Building overwhelming numbers systematically)

Third, I would audit every official in government immediately. Those who do not align with Haiti's interests would be removed, similar to what Bukele did in El Salvador. But I would start with customs, ports, and key ministries where the real money flows, doing this systematically rather than creating administrative chaos. Yes, that would put a target on my back, so I would need loyal bodyguards constantly, similar to Traor√© in Burkina Faso. Anti-corruption investigators would get 10% of recovered funds to make the work profitable. (Securing state from corruption)

Fourth, I would launch the biggest jobs program in Caribbean history. The goal is to put 40,000-60,000 people to work right away and jumpstart agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, and trade. It does not need to be perfect at first, only visible progress. Jobs would include paying people to plant trees and stop the 15,000 acres of topsoil we lose every year, turning agricultural waste into briquettes to break the charcoal mafia, rebuilding roads, irrigation, and terracing, and processing mangoes, coffee, and cacao locally instead of exporting raw. We would expand into light manufacturing like textiles, uniforms, footwear, and basic tools. These are industries Haiti can realistically scale. Tourism projects would secure safe coastal areas, restore beaches, and train guides and hotel workers. Fishing and small-scale shipping would be revived to feed local markets and connect cities by sea. We would also build call centers and digital outsourcing hubs to bring in steady foreign income. This program would extend to the diaspora, offering fast-track citizenship to skilled professionals abroad willing to return and contribute expertise to reconstruction. Education would change. Literacy is taught, but the new mandate from primary to university is training in practical skills: construction, agriculture, textiles, mechanics, plumbing, electrical work, food processing, coding, logistics, customer service, and anti-corruption work. (Creating jobs in all sectors)

Fifth, I would flip our relationship with the Dominican Republic, really just their companies. Instead of pulling all workers at once, I would negotiate better terms. They get continued access to Haitian labor in exchange for preferential rates on construction materials, fuel, and food imports. They need workers and we need supplies. Make it beneficial for both sides rather than creating unnecessary conflict. (Cheaper materials through smart negotiation)

Sixth, I would restructure the financial system. Haiti already has a central bank, but it is corrupt. During reconstruction, the bank's role would be to protect the people's money and fund the state carefully, not recklessly. I would keep consumer lending but regulate it better. Allow productive loans in three tiers: micro for survival, meso for small business growth, macro for infrastructure and exports, all backed by diaspora bonds. The central bank could still support the government through controlled money printing. To enforce discipline, the bank and all ministries would face monthly audits released to the public, so Haitians can see where the money goes. Governors would serve staggered terms so no president could control the bank outright. Offshore banking for Haitians would be banned until the system stabilizes. We would raise $250-350 million through diaspora bonds marketed as saving Haiti, add $400-600 million in international loans and grants tied to measurable progress, pressure France for reparations tied to milestones, and tax remittances lightly on the $3 billion already flowing in. Inflation would likely rise 12-20% at first, but with exports and fiscal discipline, it would stabilize as reconstruction takes hold. (How we would pay for things)

On corruption, I would rotate officials every three years, publish all government salaries online, and make every ministry's bank statements public. Both the government and central bank would face monthly audits released to the public. Offshore banking for Haitians would be banned temporarily until the system stabilizes. Whistleblowers would get 10% of recovered funds. Corruption would become much riskier.

Seventh, each secured city would get solar microgrids so we do not wait for national power, upgraded ports for expanded trade, and new courts, schools, hospitals, and police academies. But we do this sequentially, proving success in one city before expanding to the next. Each victory becomes proof that government control delivers results. (Spreading development to cities systematically)

Eighth, I would strangle gang finances from every angle. Use the diaspora to expose and pressure funders abroad since many have family living in Miami, Montreal, or New York off crime money. Control ports in secured cities and cut off customs revenue. Offer amnesty to low-level members. Early people would get the best deals with jobs, pardons, and protection. Latecomers would face prison or elimination. Create paranoia so they turn on each other. With the United States cracking down on immigrants tied to crime, that pressure could work in our favor since some Haitian gang backers in Miami are moving money and supporting operations. The diaspora would also play an active role in lobbying governments and exposing elites who launder money or send weapons. (Cutting off gang lifelines)

Ninth, we would need hard options for those who keep killing Haitians. Build a maximum-security prison on a secure island for captured gang leaders and corrupt officials. Work with the U.S. to extradite criminals already wanted for drug trafficking. For the worst offenders still massacring villages or kidnapping children, create covert special ops units for targeted captures or eliminations. Some situations require permanent solutions.

Tenth, once at least 60% of Haiti is secure and functioning better than before, I would deal with PAP through strangulation, not direct invasion. By then, we control most ports, roads, and commerce. Gang territories become isolated islands with no supply lines. Many would take amnesty deals rather than starve. Those who refuse would face security forces that outnumber them massively with superior training and equipment. (Final phase from overwhelming strength)

Lastly, I would work to control the narrative from day one. This is democratic reconstruction, not dictatorship. The draft is actually a ""National Reconstruction Corps."" We would stream progress online, showing roads being built, trees planted, gang members surrendering and getting real jobs. When critics demand immediate elections, I would respond that elections will be held on the constitutional schedule once we have basic security and functioning institutions. We work within legal limits while building institutions strong enough to survive political transitions. The goal is proving democratic governance can deliver results, making it harder for future authoritarians to justify takeovers. Once the changes begin and we show sustained progress, the system becomes self-reinforcing because people see government control actually improves their lives.

My 3 month indoor kitten was diagnosed with ear mites at 2 months and her ears were cleaned and a spot on applied. 

Recently I saw the brown coffee grounds type flecks in her ears and thought she got them again or it didn‚Äôt go away the first time. 

So, I searched online and poured some drops of coconut oil in her ears because spot ok can only be applied after a month or so I was told. A lot of gunk came out. A lot. Mostly sticky, skin flakes of brownish red. 

Today, her ears have this weird flaky skin inside- which is normal colored. 

What is it? Should I go to the vet?

Summary:
Thirteen years into her successful career as a global superstar, Lena Luthor's got a lot of explaining to do. Everyone thinks that they know her, or has an opinion on her life, who's she's dating, what she's wearing, who she's singing about, but the truth is, they don't know her at all. 
Following a career of ups and downs, lies and secrecy, and more than her fair share of slanderous comments about her notorious breakup songs about ex-boyfriends, she finally decides to come clean in a tell-all interview with one of the biggest talk show hosts, hoping to clear the air once and for all. 
No more secrets, no more lies, even if it costs her the career she's worked so hard to build. She's finally ready to tell the brutal truth about her glamorous and scandalous life, about the ruthless ambition that thrust her to the top of the charts, the friends and enemies she made along the way, and reveal the truth about the love of her life.

Summary:
When Lena meets Kara, a soldier home on leave as she waits for her next deployment, at a local coffee shop one afternoon, her life is completely tipped upside down in an instant. As they start talking, Lena feels drawn to Kara; there's something about her warmth and openness that fills the gap left by Lena's troubled childhood.
Growing closer over the next few months, falling fast for each other, the two of them find themselves unable to stay away, but Kara's next deployment is inevitable, and with promises that she'll come home, Lena waits for her.

Summary:
All Lena Luthor wants to do in life is fall in love. She has everything she could ever dream of - heiress to a large fortune, the career she's always wanted, and adoring friends - but love is the one area of her life she's always failed at. Falling in love at the drop of a hat, she finds herself always a little bit heartbroken, with a string of one-night stands, flings, and failed relationships in her wake. It's not for lack of trying but they just never seem to stick.
When she meets a stranger in a bar, she's certain this time she's found the one, but Kara Danvers is strangely immune to her charm and so aloof that Lena can't help but fall head over heels with her and the thrill of trying to sweep her off her feet. But love is rarely simple and things are never as easy as they seem.

Somehow she already knows that calling back isn‚Äôt going to work out in her favor, so instead she closes her eyes and clicks on the voicemail.
‚ÄúHi Lena, this is Kara Danvers! I got your messages, all seven of them.

Coastal humidity, salty air, fine dust, pet traffic, and the occasional ‚Äúwine + Netflix‚Äù incident stack up fast. I put together a practical playbook you can use whether you‚Äôre a renter in North Park, a family in Mira Mesa, or managing a short-term rental near the beach.

# When DIY Makes Sense vs. When to Call a Pro

**DIY is reasonable when:**

* Fresh food or drink spills on synthetic fabrics (poly, microfiber).
* Light pet odors without deep saturation.
* Routine refresh on cushions with removable covers.

**Call a pro when:**

* Pet urine reached the foam or decking (wood/webbing under cushions).
* Natural fibers (linen, wool, viscose/rayon, silk, cotton blends).
* Old stains that ‚Äúkeep coming back‚Äù after each cleaning.
* You see browning, yellow rings, or crunchy texture after DIY.
* You need fast dry times before guests arrive.

If you go pro, San Diego rates are typically **$75‚Äì$160+** depending on size, fabric, and odor/stain work. Here‚Äôs a transparent local resource page: [https://clean-vibe.com/san-diego/upholstery-cleaning/](https://clean-vibe.com/san-diego/upholstery-cleaning/). For other cities, use the main site: [https://clean-vibe.com/](https://clean-vibe.com/).

# The 10-Minute Spill Protocol (Save this)

1. **Blot, don‚Äôt rub.** Use white towels. Press firmly to lift, not smear.
2. **Test first.** On a hidden area. Color loss = stop and call a pro.
3. **For wine/coffee:** 1 cup cool water + ¬Ω tsp clear dish soap. Lightly dampen towel, dab from edges inward. Blot dry.
4. **For oil/grease:** Sprinkle cornstarch/baby powder. Let sit 20‚Äì30 min. Vacuum. Then mild soap mix as above.
5. **For dairy/egg:** Cool water only at first. Proteins set with heat. Then mild soap solution and blot.
6. **For mud:** Let it dry. Vacuum. Then mild soap solution.
7. **For pet urine (fresh):** Blot as much as possible. Mix 1 cup cool water + 1 tbsp white vinegar. Lightly dab, then blot dry. If padding is wet or odor is strong, skip DIY and book extraction.
8. **Rinse pass:** Lightly mist plain water to remove residue. Blot again.
9. **Drying:** Fan + cross-ventilation. Avoid direct heat.
10. **Reassess after 24 hrs.** If a yellow ring or odor returns, you‚Äôre dealing with wicking from deeper layers ‚Üí pro extraction.

# San Diego Fabric Quick-Guide

* **Microfiber/Poly:** DIY-friendly. Avoid soaked cushions; they trap moisture.
* **Cotton/Linen:** Beautiful but unforgiving. Swelling and browning are common. Pre-test. Often pro only.
* **Viscose/Rayon/Modal:** Delicate, prone to watermarks. Strongly consider pro.
* **Wool/Blends:** Cool water, neutral pH. Heat shrinks fibers.
* **Leather:** No alcohol, no Magic Eraser. Use leather-safe cleaner and conditioner. Sun exposure + salt air = cracking; condition quarterly.

# Why Stains Reappear After You ‚ÄúCleaned‚Äù Them

* **Wicking:** Stain traveled deep. After you surface-cleaned, remaining moisture pulled it back up while drying.
* **Residue:** Strong chemicals or too much soap left sticky film, so dust sticks and darkens the area.
* **pH Mismatch:** Wrong chemistry sets tannins, browning, or dyes.

**Fix:** Controlled hot-water extraction, correct prespray for the stain type, fiber-safe rinse, and airflow-assisted drying.

# Odors: What Actually Works

* **Masking sprays** = short relief.
* **Oxidizers/enzymes** = correct approach, but you must reach the source.
* **Urine in foam** needs saturation flush and extraction. If it hit the deck or frame, you may need partial replacement.

If odor returns within 48 hours, it‚Äôs in the padding. That‚Äôs the cue for professional flush + targeted odor treatment.

# Drying Fast in Coastal Humidity

* Open windows on the **leeward side** and run a box fan across the surface.
* If outside air is humid, run **A/C (dry mode)** and a fan; airflow beats heat.
* Flip/stand cushions vertically so both faces get airflow.
* Typical pro jobs dry in **2‚Äì6 hours** with proper vacuum and airflow.

# Avoid These Common Mistakes

* **Vinegar + baking soda volcanoes** on fabric. They neutralize each other and often leave residue.
* **Undiluted hydrogen peroxide** on colored textiles. Can bleach or yellow.
* **Heavy scrubbing** that lifts pile or pills delicate weaves.
* **Rental machines** that leave gallons behind. Slow, musty dry = new odors.
* **‚ÄúAll-purpose‚Äù solvents** on leather or linen. Permanent damage risk.

# How Often Should You Clean?

* **Families with kids/pets:** 6‚Äì12 months.
* **Light use:** 12‚Äì18 months.
* **Allergy/asthma:** More often; focus on dust removal and proper rinse.
* **Hosts/STRs:** Between guest cycles or monthly touch-ups on high-use pieces.

# Prep Checklist Before a Pro Visit

* Clear the area and note stains you care about most.
* Vacuum pet hair thoroughly; this speeds up real cleaning.
* Share fabric tags (W/S/WS/DRY CLEAN ONLY) or purchase details if you have them.
* Mention previous products used. It changes chemistry selection.
* Plan airflow: have a fan ready or ask for a turbo-air mover.

# Transparent Pricing and What Affects It

* **Size & complexity:** Sectionals > loveseats > chairs.
* **Fiber type:** Linen/viscose/leather take more time and care.
* **Soil load:** Heavy pet hair, oils, or filtration lines add labor.
* **Odor/stain treatments:** Enzyme/oxidizer work is separate from base cleaning.
* **Protectant:** Consider a fluoropolymer guard for dining chairs and family sofas; it buys time on the next spill.

# AMA-Style FAQ

**Q: Can I safely use a ‚Äúmagic eraser‚Äù on my sofa?**  
A: Not on fabric. It‚Äôs a micro-abrasive. It can fuzz or lighten fibers. On some leathers it will remove finish. Avoid.

**Q: My couch smells fine when dry but stinks when it‚Äôs humid. Why?**  
A: Residual soils and detergents are hygroscopic. They absorb moisture from the air and re-emit odors. You need a rinse that removes residue, not just perfumes it.

**Q: Is steam the same as hot-water extraction?**  
A: Most ‚Äústeam cleaning‚Äù for upholstery is actually hot-water extraction with controlled heat and vacuum. True steam can be risky on many textiles.

**Q: How do I protect a performance linen sofa with kids and a dog?**  
A: Use a fabric guard after cleaning, add washable throws on high-contact zones, and vacuum weekly with a soft brush. Spot-clean spills immediately and keep a fan handy.

As someone who deeply values their morning cup of coffee, this compact machine seemed like the ideal solution for my ever-changing preferences between coffee pods and fresh grounds. While the experience has been largely positive, there are a few quirks worth pointing out.

**Sleek Design That Fits Anywhere**

What initially drew me to this coffee maker was its slim, space-saving design. Measuring less than 5 inches wide, it fits perfectly in my small kitchen, even with limited counter space. I even joked with my spouse that it slips between the toaster and blender like a ninja! It‚Äôs such a relief to have a machine that doesn‚Äôt dominate the counter but still offers versatility. The modern black finish and touch-sensitive controls give it a high-end feel, blending seamlessly with the other kitchen gadgets.

**Straightforward Operation and Brewing Options**

This gadget makes mornings simpler. Its design allows you to brew either with a coffee pod or with grounds, depending on your mood. I find myself alternating between K-Cups and fresh ground coffee, and the experience with both has been consistently smooth. The controls are touch-sensitive, making it a breeze to switch between the regular and bold brew options. On days when I need an extra kick, that bold brew option is my go-to. Brewing an 8-ounce cup with a pod takes just about two minutes, which means I can conquer my morning rush without standing in line at a cafe.

**Convenient Water Reservoir and Brewing Size Options**

One neat feature is the 14-ounce water reservoir that‚Äôs incredibly easy to fill, thanks to its water view window. Whether I‚Äôm just brewing a quick single cup or going for the max size, filling up has never been an issue. This flexibility is especially helpful when I‚Äôm hosting friends, as they get to pick their coffee strength and cup size.

**Positives**

A product's upsides often make or break the purchasing experience, and this coffee maker boasts several.

- Compact size fits effortlessly into small spaces.
- Offers versatility with pod or ground coffee brewing.
- Touch controls provide straightforward customization for regular or bold coffee.
- Quick brewing time is perfect for busy mornings.

**Adverse Aspects**

Though I‚Äôve enjoyed using the machine, there are a couple of quirks worth mentioning. 

- The coffee maker requires manual cleaning of the pod and ground holders after each use.
- Water tends to splash a bit when filling the reservoir up to its maximum capacity.
- It lacks a built-in timer or scheduling feature, which could add more convenience.

**Product Alternatives**

Exploring similar products in the single-serve coffee maker market, the competition is strong. The Keurig K-Mini is often perceived as a rival, offering a similarly slim design and fast brewing. However, it lacks the same level of versatility since there are no options to use coffee grounds without a separate attachment. The Nespresso Pixie, on the other hand, excels with its sleek aluminum build and flavor-rich espresso capabilities, but it‚Äôs strictly a pod-based machine and lacks the regular coffee option. What makes the Hamilton Beach design appealing is its ability to cater to both coffee purists and pod enthusiasts, giving it a unique edge in the market.

**True Value**

Assessing whether this gadget is worth the investment largely depends on your coffee habits. Given its ability to cater to both coffee pods and grounds, and the excellent cup of coffee it brews in such little time, it feels like a worthwhile addition to any kitchen. While some additional features like a timer or a larger reservoir might be nice, they‚Äôre not essential for my needs. It offers the perfect balance of quality, convenience, and flexibility for the price point.

My second turns 9 months old this week and I thought I‚Äôd be over this. I‚Äôm angry all of the time and it makes me mad I‚Äôm so mad!! It‚Äôs so stupid. 

Everything sets me off. The kids crying, the dog licking her paws, my husband asking me mundane questions. It all just pisses me off. Uncontrollably so.

I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm so tired of snapping at my husband and our toddler. I‚Äôm tired of feeling angry all the time then feeling guilty about it. But I also feel like I just want everyone around me to shut the fuck up and give me some god damn space. I‚Äôm a SAHM where my biggest ‚Äúbreak‚Äù is a 20 minute coffee run. My 9 months is EBF and we‚Äôve been desperately trying bottles of formula, I don‚Äôt make enough to pump nor do I want to. Tried normal bottles, open cups, straws. He hates it all and is glued to me.

I've tried putting my best foot forward, masking, being polite, learning the cultural rules of the town via constant interaction thru my job (at a local grocery store) and... most people treat me as if I'm a see-through object that hands them money. They don't treat my coworkers like that at all given they've been here either their whole lives, or a few years. I decided to pick up another job at an indy coffee shop as it's a nice third space with a better client base. After 2 shifts out of the promised 2 weeks I would have to train, my boss, in a sickly sweet tone, tells me it isn't working out and they notice how I ""shut down"" during work. I've a strong memory of processes and events, and the closest thing I could call a ""shut down"" during my 2 shifts at the shop was me asking a customer to repeat their drink order. As anyone would if given a unique-to-the-shop sales interface to work with. Never even got to make drinks. I was upset but masked it in the moment, and went home. I've gotten coffee a few times there in the week since, and the amount of eyes that dart to me, in total silence, when I walk in makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. In my mind, there goes the only social space in town I felt comfortable existing in. I don't know what the hell I did to warrant any of this weirdness. I've just been trying to be a person-of-the-town with kindness and integrity. In other words: I'm new in town, trying to survive with a smile on my face, and I might as well be a cockroach to these townies.

Es geht dort eigentlich immer um Zwecke, die eine klare Gegenleistung haben. [Hier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steuern/comments/1eqochw/buy_me_a_coffee_wie_zu_versteuern/) geht es beispielsweise um ein Team, das gemeinsam ein Computerspiel entwickelt.

Auch ich √ºberlege einen ""buy me a coffee"" Spenden-Button einzurichten. 

Ich arbeite in meiner Freizeit allerdings an gemeinn√ºtzigen Projekten. In meinem Fall gibt es also ganz klar **keine Gegenleistung f√ºr potentiell Spendende**, da ich durch die Spenden lediglich die Ausgaben meiner gemeinn√ºtzigen Projekte refinanzieren m√∂chte. Zudem m√∂chte ich mit dem Geld in der Lage sein, weniger zu arbeiten und mehr Zeit in die Arbeit an meinen gemeinn√ºtzigen Projekten zu investieren.

Bisher habe ich nur in [diesem Artikel zu Crowdfunding](https://www.goodcrowd.org/blog/privat-spenden-sammeln-crowdfunding) etwas dazu gefunden, wobei dort von pers√∂nlichen Zwecken die Rede ist, nicht von gemeinn√ºtzigen Zwecken:

Daher folgende Fragen:

1. Sind Einnahmen √ºber ""buy me a coffee"" oder √§hnliche Dienste in meinem Fall als Schenkung zu betrachten und daher (bis zu bestimmten Freibetr√§gen) steuerfrei? 
2. Oder w√§re es in meinem Fall steuerlich sinnvoller, nicht als Privatperson zu agieren, sondern bspw. als gUG / gGmbH / e.V. / Stiftung...? K√∂nnte ich mir in diesem Fall ein Gehalt auszahlen? Ab welchem Spenden-Einkommen w√§re das ein sinnvoller Schritt?

Ich denke zwar nicht, dass die Einnahmen gerade am Anfang den b√ºrokratischen Aufwand von gUG / gGmbH / e.V. / Stiftung etc. rechtfertigen w√ºrden, aber ich w√ºsste zumindest gerne etwas mehr √ºber die rechtlichen Aspekte meiner Vorhaben.",1,1756135967.0,Steuern,1,1.0,False

Risk is very important. When you are in your twenties, much like fitness, it comes naturally. As you grow older you have to actively exercise it just like a muscle. As you mature as a person, as an entrepreneur, and as a business, you tend to get risk-averse. You are more comfortable so there is not as much need, but you also have more to lose. So I look at it as exercise. I convince myself to take more risk, and be more uncomfortable because I want to grow myself and my company.   
  
Alright, so for those in our community who might not be familiar with your business, can you tell us more?  
  
Freight Right was founded with a simple mission: to make global trade more transparent, efficient, and accessible for businesses of all sizes. As a full-service freight forwarding and freight technology company, we‚Äôve built our reputation on providing reliable, data-driven logistics solutions while combining the personalized attention of a boutique forwarder with the innovation of a modern tech platform. What sets Freight Right apart is our approach to solving real-world shipping challenges. Global logistics has long been burdened by complexity, lack of visibility, and unpredictable costs. It‚Äôs an incredibly commodified industry and very influenced by changes in domestic and global trade policy and market prices. We built Freight Right to change that narrative. By leveraging technology and automation, without sacrificing the human expertise that matters most, we‚Äôve helped thousands of businesses navigate tariffs, shifting supply chains, volatile freight markets and, as of late, expand into new markets with confidence and precision. Getting here wasn‚Äôt easy. Resourcefulness, frugality and scrappiness were, and continue to be things we turn to. We‚Äôre a lean company and it‚Äôs a point of pride for us. The team we built is truly a team of experts in their crafts more than capable of going above and beyond for their clients and using their expertise to solve challenging problems. We launched in an industry dominated by decades-old giants with massive resources during the 2008 recession, a time when all of global activity was thrown into chaos. Competing meant outthinking and out maneuvering the big guys as well as the small guys whose pool we were competing in. We invested heavily in understanding the pain points our customers faced, from opaque pricing to unpredictable transit times, and designed solutions to address them head-on. Early on, we had to fight for every lane, every client, every shipment. But those challenges pushed us to innovate faster, stay nimble, and earn trust through results, not promises.We‚Äôre most proud of two things: the relationships we‚Äôve built with our clients and the technology we‚Äôve developed to empower them. Many of our customers think of us not just as their freight forwarder, but as an extension of their supply chain team. Our tech platform gives them real-time visibility, actionable insights, and control over their logistics like never before, something we wish had existed for shippers long before we came along.The lessons we‚Äôve learned are simple but hard-earned. In this industry, you win on transparency, communication, expertise, and resilience. Supply chains are unpredictable, policies change overnight, markets can flip in days. What matters most is having a partner who anticipates those shifts and navigates them with you.If there‚Äôs one thing we want the world to know about our brand and story, it‚Äôs that logistics doesn‚Äôt have to be a black box. Global shipping should empower businesses, not hold them back. Every innovation we launch, every lane we open, every client we serve brings us closer to that vision.  
  
Any places to eat or things to do that you can share with our readers? If they have a friend visiting town, what are some spots they could take them to?

There‚Äôs nothing but choice and nothing but things to do.If they were visiting very local to Freight Right, La Crescenta/Montrose area, Tickle Tree Cafe, Black Cow Cafe and Sakana Sushi & Grill would be places to visit. The Freight Right office is very close to Foothills Boulevard so these places in particular are some of the places we‚Äôre usually going to, have folks going to or bringing company from out of town to for breakfast or lunch. It goes without saying but Griffith Park would certainly be on the list for every reason you can imagine. Descanso Gardens would be a very close second. It‚Äôs a place we would go as a family back when the kids were younger. If you happen to be a fan of the band System of a Down, Kavat Coffee, the lead singer Serj Tankian‚Äôs coffee shop and brand, is located in Eagle Rock just between Glendale and Pasadena. It‚Äôs worth checking out for a cup of Armenian coffee which, to the uninitiated, will find it to be it‚Äôs own coffee experience. Shoutout is all about shouting out others who you feel deserve additional recognition and exposure.

1mztmms,https://www.reddit.com/r/quickmill/comments/1mztmms/some_popup_observations/,Some Pop-Up Observations,"Hello! 
Just wanted to share some thoughts on the Pop Up after about 10ish coffees and see if others are having some of the same problems. 

Firstly, I love the machine and the coffee. 
A great feature I haven‚Äôt heard anyone mention is if you purge through the shower screen after steaming, the pump shuts off automatically when it gets back to your brew temp. Very cool!

Also, a gripe I‚Äôve heard a few times was the steam wand being too long- this is no longer the case. I believe QM quietly fixed this on newer units. 

The slanted cup warmer- yikes. This is pretty bad lol. It seems to me the main reason for this is to make the pressure gauge more usable with less hunching over? It is after all, with the flow valve, the big feature/selling point of the machine. I would personally much rather hunch. 

Odd boiler/steam issue- one time while steaming milk, the steam ran out very quickly. After only 10-12 seconds. Not sure if the boiler was empty or what. Is there a way to manually fill it? Thought it would always be topping itself up. 

Pucks- the pucks are pretty rough. Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here. Soupy on top, and basically concrete underneath. The soupy stuff on top knocks out, and I‚Äôm left having to scrape the rest out with a spoon. This is not a deal breaker, but definitely stinks. 

Over all I‚Äôm very happy, especially at the price I paid ~930 USD. 
Thanks!

1mztkrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/1mztkrw/how_does_norwegian_society_compare_to_this/,How does Norwegian society compare to this?,"So this is a very personal story, but I've been contemplating this for a long time now and I feel now is the right time to ask about how Norwegian society compares to my home country's.

As a father of two and a husband me and my family live in a Western European country where we've had several years now of not feeling as part of society because of how things have developed over time. We've lost connection and apart from it physically still being our home country, we have less and less feelings that bind us to ""our"" country. And since we have experienced Norway a few times during holidays, recently yet again, we cannot shake off the feeling that Norway is completely different in all the right ways for us.

And before I continue, yes I know the usual caveats like ""you've only been here on holiday for a few weeks, working/living here is different"" or ""Norway isn't a perfect country either"" or ""X or Y is bad on Norway"" (like the high prices). I don't say this because I don't want you repeating it to me, purely to emphasise that I'm not coming from nothing in terms of knowledge and I've done my homework to the best of my abilities.

For example: in my country it has become nearly impossible to correct someone for their behaviour or actions in public, whether it is an adult throwing trash on the street or a kid misbehaving or being mean to another kid. I grew up with that being normal and had that happen to myself when I was a kid all the time, that's part of how you grow up. Now if you say something, most adults will at the very least say ""get lost, it's none of your business"" or even worse by starting to come at you either aggressively or even physically. Kids are sometimes the same by simply not listening or having a foul mouth or even walking up to their bigger sibling or parent and have them escalate the situation. And even explaining why you calmly asked for something or said something like they shouldn't throw trash on the street, parents will then say something like ""you don't tell me how I raise my kids"". To be fair: in Norway I've only confronted someone once but he did grab his plastic wrap from the ground and looked for a bin and said ""oh yeah sorry"" and that was it. But I've seen a few situations where others said something in public spaces and it didn't escalate.

Another example is driving/traffic. First of all, even though I haven't been to Oslo, I've been to Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim for example and all of those cities and all the roads in between are very nice to drive, people are patient, really calm and thankful if you let them pass once there's room for it. Sure there are some 'maniacs' driving way over the speed limits, but nothing compared to my home country where literally as soon I drove near the border and the first few km's I noticed that same aggressive behaviour again. A lot of people have no patience, drive way too fast (as in: 90-110 where 80 is allowed), they tailgate you with no more than a meter distance, flash their lights or even honk if they want to get past even when I'm driving 90 on the speedo on an 80 road and it's a single lane. And people sometimes get so angry they're brake testing you once they get past or stopping at the stoplight, get out of their car and furiously come up to you. A big portion also cuts you off and simply keep no distance. Of course it's not all drivers, but a bigger and bigger portion. And it has become so frustrating that it's eating me up from inside. After every somewhat longer drive I'm so tense nowadays because of all the stuff that's happened that I can't just shake it off. And driving in Norway feels like a big relieve and a social thing, people take other drivers into consideration, let you through and know that they're not the only ones on the road.

Another thing is about neighbourhoods and noise levels. Every time we've been to Norway we've had several Airbnbs, partly because that's simply much nicer than a cramped hotel room but it's often just as expensive or even cheaper. And you get to ""live"" next to actual Norwegians for a few weeks in an actual suburb. While we heard somewhat loud music twice or so in our 10+ Airbnbs, the people themselves are very quiet and hardly noticeable even when their out in their garden gardening, with their kids or just enjoying a cup of coffee in the evening. And the moments I heard loud music it stopped straight away when it became 23:00. I remember an Airbnb in Kristiansand in the hills a bit where the neighbours to the left where slightly higher than us and the ones to the right slightly lower so we look into their garden easily and the others into ours and so we could see on one evening that everybody was out and about but it was a very social affair, one was bbq-ing and the others playing with their children but no loud noises were made. If this was a situation in my home country I can assure the bbq would be accompanied by loud music the whole night and wouldn't stick to the ""no noise after 23:00"" rule, like very often.

Also while people aren't chatty in Norway, they are nice once you get talking to them. Whether it's in a restaurant or doing grocery shopping or meeting one of the neighbours.

In our country we moved twice in the past 5 years. First from a big city to a village and then to an even more remote location simply to try and create a calmer environment for ourselves. And yes, we're introverts for those wondering. We could take these steps because we have small families, so very few relatives which is also partly because some of our relatives live in another country. Because another family member is about to emigrate (not to Norway btw) my wife will soon only have 2 nieces here but she only has active contact with one. For me due to personal circumstances I had to let go of large part of the family and I just 2 family members left as well, also where I only have proper contact with one. So probably that makes it easier for us to not feel attached to a certain location.

However, we do have two kids and we want to make a good informed decision. One has just gone off to middle school and the younger one is still in primary school. If it was just me and my wife, we'd just take the gamble and try and find work and a home in Norway. But with two kids we don't just want to gamble it. An idea we have is because I can work from home often is I could discuss with my boss to work from home for like 6 months and rent something in Norway for that time. My wife suggested that while it wouldn't be ideal, I could maybe also take my younger one to Norway for those 6 months but it would probably be difficult or impossible to just have him get into school there. The idea would be that the two of us could get a proper taste of it and 6 months should be enough to get a good idea if we want to go through with it or not. And 6 months is the amount of time that's allowed without requiring a work visum or similar.

Now don't get me wrong: we don't take this lightly. But that's also why I'm asking to see if our experiences during holidays are in line with real life in Norway. And since I've been lurking here for a good while, I know that getting a job is probably the most difficult aspect. Regarding the kids themselves: they love it in Norway and while you might say that's because it's a holiday, I can guarantee you that they definitely didn't like all holidays. They love hiking, fishing, kayaking and so on so Norway really does seem like a good fit for them as well. We've carefully dropped the idea on them and they love the idea. 

So in short: of course there will be challenges and difficulties like finding a job, a house and so on, since we're not bound to family in that sense it's rather easy for us to actually go through with it. Oh and we'd be looking at the south to southwest part of Norway, if I had to name places right now I'd say Stavanger, Kristiansand, Bergen for example or maybe outside of Oslo but we've never been there so we would first need to try that out of course.

Is there a kind of housing website in Norway that lists houses for sale and covers all, meaning just like Airbnb for holidays if it's possible I'd want to check out a website that is known to have a good coverage of most house listings. Just to get an idea initially.

Any criticism, tips, guidance is welcome. Thanks in advance everyone.",1,1756135642.0,Norway,10,0.53,False

At thirty-two, she was older than most of the college crowd renting houses on her street, but she blended in well enough‚Äîworking nights at a diner, finishing her degree part-time, raising her son on her own.

Rachel froze on the couch, textbook still open in her lap. Her phone lit up on the coffee table, buzzing with a text from an unknown number:

Don‚Äôt open it.

Her pulse spiked. She glanced toward the hallway where her son was asleep, then back at the door. Through the thin curtain she could just make out the outline of a man standing still on the porch. Broad shoulders. Waiting.

In March of 2019, out of nowhere, being a normal healthy adult male, I had a non-clonic seizure. I fell to the floor in my living room, and came to in an ER which resulted in a 4 day stay with more non-clonic seizures. I got an initial diagnosis of Functional Neurological Disorder because I wasn't showing markers on my EEGs, and the docs in Maine didn't see the Encepholomalacia that would ultimately be my permanent diagnosis.

Through the summer of 2019, I was having 5+ non-clonic seizures a day, and very rarely a grand mal seizure. I flew to Florida and got into Nemours and we ultimately got my diagnosis, and tried a bunch of meds, ultimately finding a combination that works (Trileptal and Topiramate). Along with medical marijuana of the edible variety.

After I got better, I went 5 years without a seizure. In October of '24, I'm married to a new woman, with a new baby, and I have a grand mal seizure in my sleep. My wife sees it and I come out of it in my postictal state with EMTs in my house. I refuse transport because I know how ERs deal with seizures (get a CT, refer to neurology, and discharge, happened many times).

I expect to start having seizures again, but I don't. Until a month later, as we're gearing up for a road trip for Christmas, and while eating some chicken nuggets after the kids went to sleep, and all of the sudden, I come to again with EMTs in my living room. I had another grand mal seizure, and my wife had to dig food out of my mouth mid-seizure to make sure I didn't choke. This time, I go to the hospital, and the usual happens (including a discharge at 4am, making me get an uber home).

From there, I start with a new Neurologist in Maine who I actually like and feel like listens. We get a MRI with and without contrast, and we find the encephelomalacia that we think is causing the seizures. I go from December to April with no seizures.

Then in April, and every month thereafter, once a month, I've been having a bad grand mal seizure. No triggers, or any specific auras that predate them.

Now, I've got a severe pain in my right bicep out of nowhere. It's been here since April. No one knows why. After my last seizure last week, the pain/weakness has become extreme, and this is coming from someone who's been shot before. I have an extremely high pain tolerance. I can't lift up my laptop. Don't have the strength in my right arm to lift a coffee cup. Can't pickup my kids. And it's only getting worse.

Neuro wants to do an EMG test on the muscle. Primary care is referring me to pain management and wants to give me ambien (no thanks). I'm just spiraling because I feel like it's getting worse and not stopping getting worse and I'm just super afraid of what's going to happen to me. Could I die and leave my wife/kids alone? Permanently disabled and not able to provide? Not able to play guitar anymore.

This story follows letters from characters in our universe and adjacent ones. Each will carry a theme and their own story. Sometimes weaving together sometimes seemingly being outside the meta arc.

I plan to post new episodes weekly. The tone is reflective, sometimes dark, sometimes tender, and leans heavily into emotional and spiritual exploration rather than action or plot-heavy twists.

Dear Kristi

Dear Kristi,

March 26, 2012 at 12:57pm

I think on the other side you probably have better things to do than check what people are saying on Facebook about you or to you but this is my way of coping.

I miss you, friend. You meant so much to Cathy and me. You introduced us, after all. You listened to me whine and complain about little things, and you even gave me advice on how to be better. Thank you for that. Thank you for letting me distract you just by walking into your office. You were such a good friend to me.

I‚Äôve never had death come this close before, and I don‚Äôt really know how to deal with you going so early. The good part is you now know what the other side is like. Put in a good word for us over there, okay?

I was really looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks. I should have called more. But I‚Äôm glad you aren‚Äôt suffering anymore.

What‚Äôs the coffee and beer like there in heaven? Please tell me there‚Äôs beer.

I miss you.

You were more than a friend to us, you were a sister.

One day we‚Äôll share that beer or coffee together. Hopefully not too soon.

November 14, 2012 at 10:54 am

You are so missed.

There are so many moments I wish I could hear your wisdom again.

We were lucky to have you.

June 13, 2013 at 10:54 am

Hey‚Äîthank you for everything you gave me. I miss you.

We have news!

Cathy is pregnant!

You encouraged us every step, and you‚Äôre the reason we‚Äôre a family.

If it‚Äôs a girl, maybe her middle name should be Kristi‚Ä¶

July 5, 2013 at 8:43 am

It‚Äôs me again.

Things didn‚Äôt work out with the pregnancy.

I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt talk about that now.

October 17, 2013 at 9:39 am

Me again. I need your help. I wish you were still here. You always gave me the best advice, honest, whether I wanted it or not.

There‚Äôs a job prospect in Colorado. I don‚Äôt know if I should pick up and leave, or try to see this mess through here with no guarantee I‚Äôll have a job in July. It‚Äôs probably too early to know if they‚Äôll even hire me, but it‚Äôs eating me alive. What would you tell me?

September 8, 2019 at 9:06 am

Hey. It‚Äôs been a while since I wrote. Six years, actually. A lot has happened.

I did take that Colorado job. It was brutal. We didn‚Äôt handle the pregnancy losses well‚Äîtruth is, I didn‚Äôt handle them at all. That was the start of a long unraveling. A transition that took six years.

God‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even believe in an afterlife anymore. So really, I‚Äôm writing to dispersed cells and energy. Still, I talk to you.

They took advantage of me in Colorado, and I drowned in grief. We lasted barely a year. Through a conversation I imagined‚Äîwith you‚ÄîI took a job in Cleveland. Your hometown. We got pregnant again. We had a son. You would have loved him.

I got fired again. This time for telling the truth about my mental health. I kept hearing your voice from that one time: you are attracted to damaged businesses.

I finally changed careers. I‚Äôm happier now, though it took years and some self-destructive coping that made me hard to live with.

It‚Äôs been nearly ten years since we lost you. I still picture you as you were. But you‚Äôd be different now. So would I. I am different. I wish you could meet me as I am. I hid so much back then. I don‚Äôt anymore.

I miss you. We all do. Maybe there‚Äôs an afterlife, maybe not. Either way‚Äîsee you soon.

Your friend,

Miguel


Space and Time: Letter 1

Hello? Is this thing working? Did I do this right? (ruffles pages) Oh shoot, it‚Äôs already going. (clears throat)

Dear Horacio,

I just cast my first dictation spell! Just wanted to let you know. (long pause) Kidding! Really, I just wanted to say it was a pleasure to meet you in the market the other day.

Although‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm upset that you took the last lemon bar. I had my heart set on it, despite your name being on it. I need to know what spell you used to project your name on things.

I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt have time to talk more. Your friend kept pulling you away, and my group was heading back to campus. Speaking of which‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even find out if you‚Äôre part of the Orenda. Please, don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre one of those Irfan. Not that they‚Äôre bad, I just‚Ä¶ damn it. We‚Äôre told not to associate with them. It‚Äôs a whole thing, and the Orenda must convene a council.

Anyway, I just want to see you again‚Äîand maybe split a lemon bar this time. Sorry, I tend to talk before thinking‚Ä¶

Maybe dictation wasn‚Äôt the best method. But it was the only way I could get this to you since I only know your name and that you like lemon bars too. If you‚Äôre part of the Irfan, you probably have one of those nifty‚Ä¶ what do you call it? Oh yeah! Computers. We don‚Äôt have those here. Of course, if you‚Äôre part of the Orenda you know that. See! This is why dictation is horrible‚ÄîI can‚Äôt see your face or gauge how you‚Äôre reacting.

Let me start over. It was a pleasure to meet you, Horacio. I‚Äôd love to run into you again sometime. I‚Äôm in the market almost every Saturday, usually in the afternoon. I was raised in the Orenda‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have timepieces. Your friend had one of those watches, so‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs a good sign you‚Äôre part of the Irfan. If we meet there again, it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. If you even want to meet again. I hope you do.

I‚Äôd love to get to know you better‚Äîand hopefully I don‚Äôt make a complete fool of myself like I did with this letter.

Hopefully,

Aster


Uncivilized

My Dearest Isabelle,

I feel dreadful for what you must have experienced. I only saw you, eyes alight with expectation, when I pulled the box from my waistcoat pocket. Your delicate fingers clutched to your mouth in surprise as I sank to one knee. Then, as my knee touched God‚Äôs good earth, I vanished. The gaslights of New York City faded before my eyes, and I was summarily deposited here.

As to where I am, I haven‚Äôt the foggiest. I began to walk‚Äîlong and far. I wandered in this uncivilized land until I could walk no more. I do find myself fortunate to have stumbled upon humans: a camp of Natives to this land.

I swear they were as terrified of me as I was of them. I nearly stumbled into their fire and almost caught alight. After I babbled for what seemed an eternity, with no comprehension on their part, they graciously whisked me to a guarded area. Can you imagine? I do not blame them in the slightest‚Äîsome strange man, disheveled and babbling in a foreign tongue, appears from the woods.

I am eternally grateful to my hosts. These past few days, they have fed and maintained me with great hospitality. We have found some methods of communication. Eventually, they determined I must contribute if I am to remain with them. As I have no clue where I would otherwise go, I have complied.

I offered what little I know of fishing, through clumsy hand gestures, and they brought me along on a fishing expedition. It was on this expedition that I discovered the nature of my predicament. I am not lost in another world, but in time itself. I saw the southernmost tip of Manhattan Island. The land bore no footprint of Fort Amsterdam‚Äîno Dutch, English, or American colonization. It was pristine, clear, and wondrous. I was dumbstruck by how we have defiled it with decades of waste and plunder.

My dear Isabelle, I do not know if, or when, I may return to you. Yet it is my solemn duty to try. I want so much to share my journey with you. For now, I am indebted to my hosts. Their hospitality and care can never be repaid. I shall write again soon, my dear. I pray that I may one day deliver these letters in person. Until then, I will dream of your beauty, reminded daily in the world around me.

All of My Love,
Harold L. Baker

When I say it out loud it sounds pretty pathetic.. Anyways. I genuinely am looking for advice on this topic.

I'm 34 years old. I recently moved back to Arizona from Washington due to financial issues with a roommate of mine there. Long story short, I moved back home temporarily and got a successful new job. I plan on being in my own apartment within the next few months tops. For some reason, I've always found it hard to just meet people. The most common advice I heard is ""go to a sports bar"" or ""hang out around the mall"". They both just make me sound like a creep predator. My thinking is not to deliberately look for a relationship as I can think of a number of reasons why proactively seeking a relationship is just a bad idea. I've had a few close run ins as far as flirting went, but that is as far as it went. For example, I was getting a teeth cleaning and the receptionist at the Dentist was talking to me a lot, laughing asking me lots of questions. Saying I have a cute smile. I went back one time to ""ask the dentist a question"" but the reality was I just wanted to see her pretty smile as I walked in. I was close to asking her for coffee but I got cold feet as I figured since I'm a regular patient there it wouldn't be appropriate. Besides, I think she might be married. I couldn't tell she had a lot of rings on and I didn't want to stare. But I'm certain, she had a few picture frames around her desk but I couldn't see from the angle. That was the closest I've gotten to any kind of potential date. Besides that I just work a lot and on my free time try to stay proactive. A lot of my friends are gone from here now so as embarrassing as it is to say, I don't have many friends. My best friend died of Covid a few years ago, so that was a hard blow and a story for another time. I miss her every day. As far as meeting people, I don't know how I guess. My last relationship was a disaster as I got cheated on so for a long time I wasn't looking for anything. But now, since then I'm 5 years older since then and am not getting any younger.

I don't think I'm ugly or anything. I'm no Brad Pitt or Chris Hemsworth. But I wouldn't say I'm hard to look at. This is a general idea of me [here](https://imgur.com/a/UbatYIW). I practice good hygiene, my weight is under control. I like to think I'm a funny guy, always like having a good time when I can and making jokes when appropriate. I can ""read the room"" unlike a good portion of people these days. Who knows, maybe I'm delusional and there's something wrong with me xD.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",1,1756135553.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

Single level fusion on 8/13/25. Long form documenting my surgery and recovery in case it helps anyone out there! Journaling it all to see how far I‚Äôve come is helping me, so I‚Äôm gonna keep going even if no one is reading :).

Part 2 - Surgery Day: https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/s/jREvRtI4fs

Part 3:

If my surgery day was day 0, I‚Äôll pick this up with 1 day post op. 

I continued my drug induced zombie state until about 7:30am, when the cafe staff came in with breakfast. I realized I was actually hungry! I could still barely move, but I hadn‚Äôt eaten more than a few crackers and a muffin in 48 hours so I wasn‚Äôt going to let that stop me. I ate some sort of egg wrap. The warmth felt amazing. It is seriously cold in that hospital wing. Had some juice and a fruit cup. I steered clear of the coffee, I wanted to be able to keep sleeping through the worst of things. 

After breakfast I reassessed my situation. Legs felt stronger. Sciatica still mostly gone. Hips were sore but working. Core still dead asleep. But the board that was nailed to my back had been upgraded to a 2 by 4 stapled to my just my low back. Hey, there‚Äôs an improvement! I was able to move my upper back without significant pain. I still seriously felt like I was laying on a wood plank as if it were a lumbar pillow. Again, this ended up just being muscle spasm which is normal at this stage. 

Overall, I was feeling way too good for day 1. The nausea was gone. My pain was maybe a 2/10. I can‚Äôt believe how good I feel! My nurse came in right on time for meds and asked how I was feeling. I gave her the low down. She warned me this is typical. The anesthesia blur has worn off, but the nerve blocks and local shots were still locked in for a few more hours. 

Hint: listen to your care team!! I didn‚Äôt. I asked if I could cut the oxy from 10mg to 5mg since I didn‚Äôt like the woozy feeling. She said sure, but to keep the remote handy with the call button if I am in pain. 

My wife came to visit. We were happily catching up for an hour or two when I felt it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù being the surgical area. It must have been completely numb but suddenly I was acutely aware of it. Over the next hour my pain went from the 2/10 to my brand new definition of 10/10 pain. I tried to tough it out, I am a stubborn SOB. My wife wasn‚Äôt having it and hit the button for me.

I squirmed as I told the nurse I was at an 8/10. My wife corrected me (she‚Äôs good at that) and said you literally just said it was a 10/10. Nurse said it‚Äôs going to get worse, and treated me immediately with an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù sub q dilaudid shot. That would carry me through until my next pain dosage time. When that came up, she gave me 4mg of dilauded orally. 

I can honestly say that the 2 hours between when the pain kicked in and when the heavy dose of dilaudid kicked in were the most painful of my life. Listen. To. Your. Care. Team. I also requested an ice therapy machine because it hurt to lay on the bulky ice packs. They had one and it helped SO much. If this is available to you, use it! It did freeze me to my core though, so they also brought in a heater with a vent I shot into my blankets. It was comical, I was roasting on my top and freezing on my bottom. But it kept the pain at bay. 

The heavy drugs did a number on me. I was barely lucid. Wifey left to let me sleep, if you could call it that. I had some wild dreams. I tried listening to music to help, but I just incorporated the music into my crazy dreams. Elton John and I were in a music video shoot together that had all sorts of hijinks. I thought it lasted hours, but when I checked my phone it only lasted about the length of Tiny Dancer. 

They came and pulled my catheter at some point. That‚Äôs the next major story line. My bladder filled quick from all the IV fluids. Nurse said I had to pee on my own within a few hours or they would ‚Äústraight cath‚Äù me while I was awake. Hell no you aren‚Äôt! I got help standing up, listened to a babbling brook on my headphones, and spent 20 minutes imagining myself in line for the bathroom at Yankee Stadium, and finally making it to a urinal. The catheter literally makes you forget how to pee. I had to remind myself, and thankfully was able to relax the right muscles and make it happen just before I felt like my bladder was going to burst. It took a bit of a push, which they said not to do, but I was not getting cathed. 

Also, my legs itched like crazy, which they said was a reaction from the narcotics. They gave me a shot of some kind that helped tremendously. Again, make sure you are telling your team what you are feeling, they had an answer for everything. 

Night 2 continued in that fashion. Crazy dreams, sleep, pee, take a walk, more drugs, shiver, roast. It was the hardest day and night of this journey. But I promise things got much better from there!

Day 3. I had adjusted to the meds, and was probably around a 4 or 5 out of 10 pain. Compared to the day before, this felt ok. I focused on PT that day. Lots of Slow walking laps. Unfortunately I had a surgical drain in and couldn‚Äôt be discharged because it was still draining too much. I wasn‚Äôt fighting that. The care team was incredible. I was not going to fight to go home without good reason. I ate, slept and walked. I also was on a ton of laxatives that were doing their job. Some emergency bathroom runs were needed. Luckily the staff was there to help me every time. The walker was very helpful too, I still couldn‚Äôt hold my top half up without it. I also was able to reach and wipe, so I consider myself lucky. 

The nurse told me I stink and got a sponge bath ready for me. I was able to do it myself. Brushing my teeth felt amazing. I mean it all hurt, but I was getting stronger by the hour and I could feel it. My new goal was going home the next day. I walked a ton, which they said would help with drainage. 

Night 3 wasn‚Äôt too bad! Still drug induced sleep, but overall so much better than my previous two. 

I‚Äôll cover my discharge and first week at home in my next post. Thanks for reading, and I am happy to answer any questions if you have any!

1mzthhk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzthhk,I need help with my war dog foster,"Hello!

I recently adopted what I believe to be a cane corso lab mix. I believe he's about 5 years old. he has a history of physical abuse and previous owners gave him very little boundaries or training. 

The previous owner brought him to a shelter when he moved out of the country. The shelter was going to put him down for being aggressive to people and dogs. My friend signed to take liability for him and took him. She couldn't keep him long term. Then I fell in love with the big bastard. 

A week into owning him, I was playing fetch with him outside my apartment. I checked that there were no pets, but he attacked a neighbor's cat that somehow got outside. The cat had to have its leg amputated. I feel awful, and the guilt is eating me up. I realized immediately that this dog is a huge responsibility. I've never had a dog I can't safely play fetch with. 

I started my own strength training and got him a harness over the pronged collar he came with  so he can't pull the leash out of my hands. I set firm boundaries and do training sessions in the morning and night. We focus on recall. I have a command ""safe!"" So he knows to stop barking and run back to me. He is a smart boy and loves treats so training is going wonderfully. He is never off leash unless we are deep in the forest somewhere camping. 

We do exposure to people. every time he barks at a stranger, we practice recall. He's making great progress.

Yesterday on our evening walk we had two very  close calls where he tried to bite strangers. He didn't listen to recall and I don't like that my grip on his harness was the only thing keeping him from contact. What if I lose focus and he hurts someone? 

He is the sweetest boy, but he's got trauma and a lot of behavioral issues. Sometimes I fear I'm in too deep. i'm worried about his strength and size. 

He's gentle and sweet with my elderly cat but I'm worried she will swat him and he will instinctively chomp. 

He has severe separation anxiety too. He starts whining and barking if left alone for more than a few minutes. I've progressively left him alone longer and longer, but he still has accidents in the cage almost every time and seems to be in distress.

 I work from home right now and only leave him alone if I absolutely have to.i can't go to coffee shops anymore or work outside the house. We got kicked out of a local library after he tried to attack someone. I want an in person full time job but I can't leave him alone that long. 

He can't be left alone but he is also dangerous in public. I want to get to a point where he can comfortably relax in his crate while I'm out, or have him sit peacefully next to me in a coffee shop. At this point I just feel reclusive because I can't go anywhere. 

After months of training we've made tons of progress, but we are still so far. 

I want to be the best dog dad possible, but I'm getting burnt out. what can I do to make his life better?

I love him so much. he's a snuggly angel at home. He's loving, loyal, and protective. He's strong And stubborn. He's badass ! He's my boy and I want to do right by him. What do y'all suggest? 

Thanks for listening

1mztfla,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mztfla/why_choose_bluevua_ro100ropot_replacement_water/,Why Choose Bluevua RO100ROPOT Replacement Water Filter Set Review for Clean Water?,"Testing water filtration products is something I take seriously, and the Bluevua RO100ROPOT 1-Year Replacement Filter Set has left me with quite a bit to discuss. This 4-pack set includes a Polypropylene (PP) filter, a Coconut Shell Activated Carbon (CTO) filter, a Post Carbon Filter (PCF), and a Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane‚Äîall designed to elevate water quality by tackling contaminants and improving taste. My experience using this set daily has been largely positive, but there are a few areas worth mentioning for anyone considering this system.

**Streamlined Installation and Maintenance**  
I've tested several water filter systems before, and I appreciate when a product doesn‚Äôt make installation a chore. Replacing the filters in this set was refreshingly easy‚Äîno tools, no turning off the water supply, just a quick swap-and-go process. Knowing that I wouldn‚Äôt have to wrestle with complicated setups made me much more inclined to commit to maintaining the system regularly. This convenience is a win, especially for busy households. 

[Check Bluevua RO100ROPOT 1-Year Replacement Filter Set price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cpbsdnhc/)

**Long Lifespan for Better Value**  
Longevity of filters is a big deal in cost and convenience terms, and this set doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The PP, CTO, and PCF filters are designed to last for up to a year, while the RO membrane can function effectively for two years. These lifespans eliminate the need for constant replacements, which is great if you hate dealing with filter swaps every few months. I‚Äôve been using mine for months now without any noticeable drop in performance, which is a testament to their quality.

**Performance You Can (Almost) Taste**  
With claims of comprehensive filtration, I was curious to see if my tap water truly tasted any different after installing this set‚Äîand it absolutely did. The water no longer has that slightly metallic tang, and even plain glasses of water seem crisper and more refreshing. Testing it in coffee and cooking brought noticeable differences as well. Knowing the system effectively removes common contaminants gives peace of mind, especially when serving water to kids and guests.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The filters themselves feel premium‚Äîno cheap plastic components here. Despite their lightweight build, they fit perfectly into the system, and I never noticed any issues with leaks. The design is straightforward, ensuring the filters line up correctly, reducing alignment frustrations common with other filter replacements. With a compact profile, the system easily fit under my sink without hogging space.

**Good Points**  
- Simple, tool-free filter replacement makes maintenance a breeze.  
- Long lifespan reduces the frequency of filter swaps.  
- Effectively improves water taste and removes undesirable contaminants.  

**Caveats**  
- The filters are slightly pricier when compared to some alternatives.  
- Country of origin details may make some users hesitant.  
- Resetting the filter lifespan indicator can be a bit glitchy.  

**Competing Brands**  
While testing this set, I also compared it to other popular water filtration systems, like APEC‚Äôs reverse osmosis filters and iSpring‚Äôs replacement sets. One thing the Bluevua filters do better is balance ease of installation with effective performance. In contrast, APEC filters often require additional tools for installation, while iSpring‚Äôs sets can sometimes run into compatibility issues with their systems. On the flip side, competitors occasionally edge out the Bluevua set in pricing‚Äîa point worth considering if you‚Äôre on a tighter budget.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Pricing plays an important role in anyone‚Äôs decision-making process, and though you won‚Äôt find the Bluevua set in the bargain basement, you‚Äôre getting strong value for what you pay. Considering the quality of the RO membrane and the simplicity of maintenance, it‚Äôs a solid investment for households that prioritize clean, safe drinking water. If your goal is dependable performance with minimal upkeep, the price seems justified, particularly when stretched across the filters‚Äô lifespan.

1mztfjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1mztfjw/i_think_i_was_in_an_abusive_relationship/,I think I was in an abusive relationship...?,"So, Im absolutely no gem when it comes to relationships. I feel a lot of emotions very deeply but I try my hardest to get them out and eventually I will tell the person how I am feeling. I've been to lots of therapy and continue to go through therapy because well, life has kicked my buttocks and I need to be the best version of myself for me and my son. 

A lot has happened in the past 12 months and I am genuinely unsure if I was the abusive partner or if my now ex was the abusive partber. Im going to just list what happened and next to it I will write what I did. 
For context I have previously known my ex for 17 years before we had started dating. 

- month 3 his landlord kicked him out because he sold the property he and I were looking for places for him anywhere he messaged decline due to his dog. I told him he could move in with me and my kid. He said hed live out of a hotel its fine. I insisted though because I felt like it was the right thing to do. He chose to move in. During the move he got so mad he punched the moving truck. That was red flag A.

- I dont know how to explain it but I genuinely got weird anxious feelings all of the time. So I asked him if I could look at his phone. He said I wouldn't find anything got ahead, heres is password no issues. Cool! So I did and I offered my phone to him to look through. He declined.

- in the span of 12 months I found over 2000 naked pictures of exes, purchased p*rn, created explicit pictures and videos etc this caused a HUGE fight shot my anxiety through thr roof because... why the hell did he have those.  He refused to go through and delete then because ""they brought back too many nostalgic memories"" so he asked me to go through every.single.picture and delete them. I had a full on panic attack. I also found out he had sugar babies that he was still in contact with. One of which he had a 5 day snap streak with and told me he didn't know how because they never talk. 

- he had lied about me and my character to anyone who would listen in order to get sympathy. Which caused a huge problem and another panic attack. 

-found out he promised another woman hed go down to Texas from Canada to north and pick her up, share a hotel room, drive to southern Canada drop her off, then come home. I explained I dont agree with it. As it will be expensive and that sharing a bed with a woman who isn't his girlfriend is an outlandish idea especially a woman who would send him graphic hentai (which i found out after). I said go get her but separate hotel rooms are a must. We calculated it it was going to be $11,000 which he was genuinely willing to spend with seeing only $2000 back. I said it was ridiculous abd he shouldn't do it because he misses car payments and bill payments already as is. He decided against it.

- if I moved wrong, spoke in a tone he didn't liked, spoke to him during work, spoke to him during video games(which he required for 4 to 6 hours on his days off. He was off 1 to 3 days a week), he would scream and yell at me so loud and called me names  - i would become calm and try my best to diffuse the situation. He would get mad and call me a narcissist and tell me what I was doing was manipulating him by making him mad and then being calm to make him look bad. I often heard ""shut up"" and ""just leave me the F alone"". Sometimes I would fight back. Near the end I would say how he spoke to me is feeling like emotional abuse and it needs to stop. As time got on I lost interest in being nice back. Oh during these times, I wrote him love letters for work and cooked him meals because he works for over 16 hrs a day. Sometimes hed eat them more often then not hed go buy food. 

-if I didnt respond to his messages he would become impatient and mean 

-he begged to let him buy large Costco hauls, begged to let me let him pay for bills.  If I agreed hed go to his friends and complain about how unfair it is that he pays for more things because he isn't home he's always at work. His rent $200 it went up to $400 because things like food got expensive. So he insisted on buying food and paying $400 i figured that was ok because I was making him lunches. No. It wasn't ok apparently. 

-I would become vulnerable with him and let him know that his actions and words trigger me due to past abuse i have faced.  He apologized and then used those things to scare me. We later had a conversation where I told him it doesn't make sense to me house someone would do that to a person they claim to love. If I said I am feel ____ because of an action or how he spoke to me he would say I am a narcissist and I abuse him. Was I always cool calm and collected? Absolutely not i flew off the handle more than a few times.

-I found out he had a p*rn addiction i thanked him for being vulnerable with me. He told me he would watch things infront of me on the couch.  At work he woukd indulge in it often and that HE felt it was causing a rift in our relationship.  I said ok how can I help. He aaid keep me accountable so I did. His idea was to""share"" the videos or whatever with me so that he stops feeling gross and alone while indulging. I said sure why not. - I became VERY obsessed with this because I knew he lied about little and big things constantly.  I woukd always ask ""have you been watching p*rn"" he would always deny it and then come back later and say he was. At one point he held my face in his hands and promised me he wasn't doing anything like that at all. 2 days later ""yea, I did im sorry but atleast I told the truth now"" I lost my mind  

- I found out I had Adenomyosis which means I need a hysterectomy to remove any overgrown tissue thats causing issues. He was mad we couldn't have kid but was supportive for a bit when I would confide in him. Then he got visibly annoyed when I'd bring it up again. The doctors put me on a medication to induce menopause to ease symptoms which in itself causes a lot of uhm issues, emotionally, physically etc I asked him to read up on medication induced menopause and Adenomyosis. He refused unless I read it to him.

- im skipping  a lot of stuff but I want to jump to yesterday where I ended things.
I was messaging him trying to figure our day out. I was in the shower and he was on his computer in the basement. Totally wrong on my part for bothering him. He flipped out at me. I left the house to cool off and get a coffee. He was swearing and calling me names saying things like he has bodily autonomy and I need to leave him alone etc so I messaged him and said I will be calling you and you need to pick up the phone. He flipped out but answered. I wasn't nice. I said what the f is your problem. He was yelling at me about I donno what then in the middle of me speaking he said ""by the way this conversation is being recorded and everyone on discord can hear you"" i responded with ""we're done"" because the day before I had literally told him if he were to ever do anything like that it would leave him. When I found that out I saw complete red. I went back to the house, stormed downstairs, and cut the power to the house because we needed to have a conversation. After the power went back on I approached him, he put his phone infront of my face and I grabbed it and tossed it. It flew further than I meant it too. He went to grab my face and stopped himself then he pushed me out of the way, threw a chair, ran upstairs and used his body to hold the door closed so I was locked in the basement and called 911 on me. Told them I was throwing things at him and chucking things around the basement at him. I threw the phone in the opposite direction of both of us. I ended up packing all of his things and putting them in the garage with his nephews help and had his nephew inform him when he can pick his stuff up today 


I by no means am a quiet party. I very much reacted when I shouldn't have and when he continuously told me to stfu I should have to saved face to stop the insults and screaming . There became a time where I had enough, I wanted to leave him like 4 months ago but was to afraid of what would happen as he was very open and honest about how if I ever leave him hed be destroyed, hed move to Australia to get away and because women were cheap there. Locking me in my own basement in my own house and calling the cops on me was the last straw though. Hes never allowed back. He can't contact me. He isn't allowed on property at all except for today when he gets all of his belongings. Im starting to worry that I was the instigater and I was the problem because... im not sad we are over. I feel relieved. I feel happy. I feel calm. Im excited to  never have to see him again. Shouldn't I be sad? For like 6 months I felt crazy. I felt like he couldn't be abusive he never showed this side before he was really sweet and amazing and then woukd completely lose it on me. It was confusing. He would claim i was doing stuff to him that I wasn't but he was doing it to me. It was weird and it was confusing and I am still confused and concerned that he is right and I was indeed the abusive one.

1mztdp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mztdp7/my_experience_upgrading_from_a_gaggia_classic_to/,My experience upgrading from a gaggia classic to a Bezzera duo top DE,"I've recently managed to snag this beast of a machine dirt cheap from a open box deal with warranty.
Granted this did come with some cosmetic damages and a missing water tank.

Still at half the original price, I still found it a bargain, and since I was on the fence for a long time I wanted to share my experience with it.

I'll add that this is paired with a Eureca mignon specialita grinder.
I usually drink milk based drinks, capuchino in general.
I believe many of my statements will apply to most dual boilers.

Pro's: 
Consistency is probably the best change for me, with the gaggia at times I'd have the perfect shot, followed by many average or below average shots.

With the Bezzera I get that godly shot every single time.
I believe this may be mainly due to the PID's in the machine and brew head giving the same temperature every time, while on the Gaggia I had to rely on temp surfing.

Heat up time is extremely fast, I believe this may also have to do with the boilers being a bit smaller than other machines, but in 5 or less minutes I can start brewing, but steam takes more like 10m.

Both being able to brew and pour water or steam at the same time is handy, but what's handier is always having steam ready, no waiting for a steam chamber to start up.

Steaming power is on another level, it takes 30-45s for me to get a pitcher with 200ml milk to go to nearly boiling, even faster if it's not fridge temperature.

The rotary pump and plumbing makes the entire experience more pleasent and removes another brewing step.

True Volumetric control based on actual volume makes it a lot simpler and quicker, I can step away from the machine without worry, getting consistently the same volume of coffee.

Con's
Obviously price, even at half off it's still 4-5 times what a gaggia classic costs.

Size and weight I underestimated, it's hard to fit in a kitchen and it's heavy and clumsy.

No flow control, basically it's a trade off, volumetric control vs flow control, for me having a quicker and easier experience, getting closer to a automatic machine is worth it, though I understand that many may prefer a more personalized experience having full control.

Lastly for now, while I get the best possible shot every single time, the taste isn't better than what I've already experienced.
For that I'd likely have to upgrade my grinder, but I believe I'm already deep into diminishing returns territory.

Though perhaps a good upgrade would be a grinder with a built in scale.

Overal I'd do it again in a heartbeat.",1,1756135216.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I get it that this is a tier 3 city and all of that, but I have struggled to make good networks or contacts here because I barely see anyone hanging out. If you are between the age group of 20-30 yo. We can create recreational activities like cycling, swimming sessions, or any sports that connect people (rather than the paid coffee and meditation that is hyping up in the city, but paid) maybe we can hang around on weekends for those music jam sessions, and who knows, maybe we can create a community.

I would personally label myself as demisexual, though some online tests would tag me as cupiosexual. I want to mention upfront that you could classify me as a neurodivergent individual, since I probably have some sort of autism-spectrum disorder. You won't notice it much, but it could be a possible explanation for why I can be weird from time (this shouldn't be an excuse by the way) Since we got that out of the way, *let us dive more into my persona*

¬†

***My persona***

I live in Central Europe, so due to my origin I'm able to speak German as well as English. I'm of Caucasian ethnicity, I have white skin, an average build at a height of 175 cm (or 5 ft 9 in) have medium-short brown hair on top, green-grey eyes with glasses on rare occasions & a short stubble face to round things off

¬†

***My lifestyle***

My occupation is something I can be very passionate about & really enjoy on a deep basis. When I'm not active due to work, I love to be active in my free time by going to the gym, going for a run or biking for example. Something I like to pair these activities with is listening to music or to a good podcast, but I usually prefer to watch rather than just listen to them. During the day I really love to drink a good cup of coffee somewhere or at home, so one day I will definitely buy myself a barista coffee machine. Currently I live on an omnivore diet, I like to cook & try different recipes. Next to that I have interests in psychology, philosophy, medicine, health & science to name a few

¬†

***My preferences***

I'm here looking for a female who is open to a long-term relationship aged between 18 - 28 though my upper limit is 30. Preferably from Europe, but I'm also open to females from (North) America. I want someone who is able to participate in a normal conversation & is emotionally available. Last but not least, someone who looks after their health & therefore has no emotional (lingering) baggage & maintains a rational normal weight

The attendant who was supposed to give the bags never showed up after 3 of us waited for 30 minutes so I had to call the number in the too good details page. After that we all got our bags.

The bags note they should have frosting but we didn't get any. I made some frosting when I got home. Overall I like the bag. They were tasty and a great way to try their offerings.

1mzt9ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mzt9ga/explore_if_the_best_electric_cooktop_lg_lce3010sb/,Explore if the Best Electric Cooktop LG LCE3010SB Lives Up to the Hype,"Using the LG LCE3010SB electric cooktop in my daily routine has been quite an experience. While I've tested numerous kitchen appliances over the years, this model presented a mix of impressive features and small quirks. The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek design‚Äîa black ceramic glass surface that complements any modern kitchen setup. It's the kind of appliance that visitors notice and compliment almost immediately. My kitchen is definitely looking sharper since I installed it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is undeniably one of its strongest suits. The glass surface is smooth and classy, so it's a match made in heaven for someone who loves clean lines in their kitchen. The 30-inch size makes it a perfect fit for medium to larger countertops. As much as I love how polished it looks, the nearly mirror-like finish means every speck of dust or smudge is visible. If you‚Äôre a neat freak like me, you might find yourself frequently wiping things down, but hey, that's just part of the deal with glossy appliances.

**Performance and Heating Elements**  
If there's one thing I value in a cooktop, it's how quickly and evenly it heats up. This one boasts five heating elements, ranging from a tiny 6-inch warm zone to a 9-inch dual burner that I found incredibly versatile. Breakfast prep was effortless‚ÄîI could keep coffee warm on one burner while whipping up pancakes on the larger one. The Steady Heat Technology, designed to maintain even heat, actually worked wonders during my cooking experiments. Heat adjustments were immediate, which saved a lot of my dishes from getting overcooked. No one enjoys burnt pasta sauce, trust me.

**Ease of Use with SmoothTouch Controls**  
Using the touch controls was a breeze, and as a tech-savvy individual, I appreciated how modern and straightforward the interface was. With just a tap, I could switch between power levels or turn on the warm function. It‚Äôs intuitive and uncluttered, but there‚Äôs a slight curveball‚Äîit‚Äôs super sensitive. Any water splashes or accidental touches triggered the settings, and there was a time my toddler managed to activate it. Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve now mastered the art of cleaning without triggering an accidental power-up. 

[Check LG LCE3010SB price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b004gz0ly0/)

**Safety Features and Indicators**  
As a parent, safety features are always a top concern. The five hot surface indicator lights were a relief because I knew exactly which burners were still warm after turning them off. That said, the lack of child safety locks gave me a mild heart attack during the aforementioned toddler incident. All appliances have room for improvement, and adding more comprehensive safety features here wouldn‚Äôt hurt. 

**Good Points**
- SmoothTouch controls simplify usage and elevate its modern feel.  
- Versatile heating elements make multi-tasking in the kitchen possible.  
- Excellent heat consistency thanks to Steady Heat Technology.  

**Areas of Concern**
- The ultra-sensitive touch controls can be accidentally triggered by water or small movements.  
- Its glossy surface requires frequent cleaning to maintain its appearance.  
- A lack of child locks might be an issue for households with young kids.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve used a few other electric cooktops before, including models from Whirlpool and GE. Compared to Whirlpool‚Äôs models, which are equally stylish, the LG has an edge with its SmoothTouch interface. GE‚Äôs cooktops, on the other hand, feel a bit sturdier and sometimes include better safety features like child locks, but they fall short when it comes to aesthetics. The LG cooktop also seemed to adjust heat levels faster than the Whirlpool and GE options. Whirlpool shines when it comes to ease of cleaning, though, as their finishes tend to hide smudges better. Honestly, it boils down to what you prioritize‚Äîperformance and design versus minimal upkeep and extra safety.

**Value for Money**  
This cooktop sits somewhere in the mid to high range when considering similar options in the market. While it may not be the most budget-friendly, the features and design justify the investment for home cooks who prioritize a mix of performance and aesthetic appeal. Its durability ensures you‚Äôre not replacing it anytime soon, and its ability to adjust to both slow cooking and rapid boiling makes it a versatile kitchen companion. That said, if you don‚Äôt mind a slightly less polished design, there might be other options with similar functionality at a lower price point.

# 1.Chapter 1 Back From The Dead

""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it‚Äîyou're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""You realize what you've done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she's so messed up she hasn't shown her face at school in days.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent‚Äîten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson's elite research team.

She'd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg's thesis was a near clone of hers‚Äîsame angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David's project was a big deal‚Äîfirst of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie's seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs‚Äîthey all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie's grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger.

Josie wasn't Natalie's biggest fan, no lie. She'd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

""You really blew it,"" Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ""Professor Lawson's giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he'll let it go.

""He'll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.""

""But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you're done. Expulsion's on the table.""

""Fine. I'll apologize,"" Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who'd fought his way into this school.

She'd known him longest‚Äîfour years. She thought he'd have her back, trust her when she said she didn't start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn't cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn't push.

""Alright, it's a deal,"" he said. ""I'll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You're reading it to the whole school tomorrow.""

Josie's lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn't that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn't the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she'd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn't taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn't be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

""There she is‚ÄîProfessor Lawson's former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department's darling for supposedly jacking her paper.""

""She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in‚Äîjust as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.""

""Look at that sour face. She's not even in Natalie's league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.""

""Have her back? Please. They're all Team Natalie now. This whole 'say sorry in front of everyone' thing? Aiden's call.""

'Aiden's idea, huh?' Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She'd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who'd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She'd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he'd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She'd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ""Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

""Never figured you'd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She's too kind to even hold it against you.

""You didn't see her after what you did. She's a mess‚Äîskinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.""

""And still, she's got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?""

""So when you see her, you better say sorry‚Äîand mean it, okay?""

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ""Got it, Jaden. I'll make things right with her, I swear.""

""Should've thought twice before pulling that stunt."" Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he'd always seen Josie as a solid kid‚Äîsmart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

'So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?' Jaden wondered, shaking his head. 'What a letdown.'

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson's office.

# 2.Chapter 2 Saying Sorry

The air in David's office was thick with tension as the whole team sat crammed inside.

When Josie walked in, the vibe turned frosty, faces souring like they'd bitten into a lemon.

Except for Natalie. She jumped up, flashing a grin bright enough to blind. ""Josie! You showed!""

""I'm here to say sorry,"" Josie said, sidestepping Natalie's grabby hands.

She didn't have Natalie's gift for playing nice with people she couldn't stand.

Natalie faltered, like she'd been caught off guard. ""Wait, you still think I'm shady, don't you?""

Her voice quivered, eyes glistening like she was about to bawl. ""I didn't copy your paper, Josie. Take it to the dean if you don't believe me. Let them figure it out.""

Josie dropped her gaze, looking more pathetic than Natalie's theatrics. ""I'm apologizing, okay? The papers looking so similar threw me, but I wasn't gonna snitch.

""I didn't breathe a word to anyone else.""

The team, who'd been glaring at Josie like she'd kicked a puppy, started to rethink things.

Josie wasn't a gossip‚Äîshe barely had friends outside the lab. This drama? She'd only mentioned it to them.

Aiden's frown eased, his eyes settling on Josie. ""I buy that you didn't mean to stir the pot, but Natalie got burned.

""If you hadn't gone all detective, people wouldn't be whispering about her stealing your work.""

""An apology's not too much to ask,"" he added, arms crossed.

Aiden was the team's golden boy‚Äîbrains, looks, the whole package.

Josie had picked this major partly because it was the med school's hot ticket, but let's be real: Aiden was a big reason too.

He'd been her hero once. Once. Not anymore.

""Fair point,"" Kyle Langton, another senior, chimed in. ""Josie, I'm with Aiden. You didn't mean to cause a mess.

""Natalie's a softie, so just smooth it over, and we're all cool.""

Josie nearly laughed. Natalie, a softie? Yeah, right. But she zipped it. ""Got it, Kyle. I'll fix this.""

Turning to Natalie, she said, ""I'm sorry, Natalie. I messed up, and it hurt you. Honest‚Äîcan we move past this?""

Then it hit her. Josie had been tight with this crew for years before Natalie rolled in. Breaking that bond? Tougher than she thought.

Natalie flashed a sugary smile. ""Josie, I was never mad! Forgive? Psh, nothing to forgive!""

She spun to David, plopping down beside him with a flirty grin, voice all sweet. ""Told ya, Professor Lawson. Josie wouldn't try to screw me over. Cut her some slack, yeah?""

Lawson wasn't biting. His face was hard as granite, shooting Josie a look that could freeze lava. ""On purpose or not, she screwed up. And screw-ups have consequences. So, Josie, how should I deal with you?""

David's face was like stone as he shot Josie a hard stare.

He'd always thought she was the good girl‚Äîsmart, driven, a total overachiever. Now? He wasn't so sure.

To him, grades were one thing, but a shady character was a dealbreaker. 'She's gotta learn her lesson,' he decided. 'No more badmouthing her classmates.'

Josie had puzzled over why everyone bought Natalie's act. After some soul-searching, it clicked: Natalie was gorgeous and a master at playing the damsel.",1,1756134943.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

This pack of wipes, loaded with thoughtful features, has become an indispensable part of my life. Imagine juggling a busy schedule, endless errands, and a toddler in tow who magically attracts dirt everywhere! These wipes claim to clean, care, and protect in one smooth motion, and honestly, they live up to the promise in more ways than one. I decided to give them a try after seeing countless positive reviews, and boy, was I impressed.

**Thoughtful Design for On-the-Go Convenience**  
The packaging is sleek, lightweight, and beautifully compact. Measuring roughly 9.25 x 7.09 x 0.67 inches, the pack fits perfectly in my backpack or my car‚Äôs glove compartment. Almost too perfectly, it‚Äôs as if it was designed to make life on the go so much simpler. During a road trip last month with my family, these wipes saved us multiple times‚Äîfrom sticky fingers after snack breaks to spilled coffee on the seats. The movie scene-worthy tantrum cleanups courtesy of these wipes? Tickets sold out every time!

[Check WaterWipes 20000015 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0dg4gp7c9/)  

**Pure Ingredients for Sensitive Skin**  
What sets these wipes apart is the simplicity of their formula. Made with 99.9% ultra-purified water and just a tiny drop of fruit extract, these wipes are hypoallergenic, unscented, and safe even for eczema-prone skin. My youngest daughter has incredibly sensitive skin, and finding something that doesn‚Äôt cause irritation has been an uphill battle. These wipes are like the unicorn of personal cleansing products‚Äîthey work effectively without any harsh chemicals. It‚Äôs aroma-free, which is another big plus for anyone (like me) who‚Äôs put off by strong artificial scents while wiping up messes.

**The Strength to Handle Tougher Messes**  
Some wipes either tear too easily or feel like thin, flimsy sheets of plastic. Not this one! WaterWipes took a bold step forward with their updated 2x stronger material that‚Äôs also thicker and softer than before. From jam-stained hands to greasy kitchen countertops, these wipes surprised me with their versatility. I‚Äôve even used them to clean up minor spills on the carpet and was pleasantly satisfied with the results.

**Key Benefits**  
- Remarkably travel-friendly and compact.  
- Pure formulation suitable for sensitive and eczema-prone skin.  
- Dual strength upgrade for tackling messy situations efficiently.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The pack design isn‚Äôt resealable enough, and sometimes I find the first few wipes drying out prematurely.  
- The size of each individual wipe is slightly smaller than some other brands packing similar promises.  
- Limited availability in certain stores makes Amazon my constant fallback option.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other personal cleansing wipes, such as Pampers Aqua Pure or Huggies Natural Care, WaterWipes stands out in terms of ingredient purity. While all brands boast being gentle on the skin, few can rival the simplicity of two ingredients. On the flip side, competitors like Pampers offer multi-pack options that add more economic value. I also tried a pack of Babyganics to compare, and although they are slightly cheaper, their texture felt rougher, not ideal for cleaning delicate infant skin. However‚Äîmuch truth‚ÄîWaterWipes dominated in terms of versatility and environmental sustainability thanks to their plant-based material.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Honestly, the price tag might make you pause at first, as it‚Äôs a tad higher than standard personal cleansing wipes. However, when you consider the premium quality, strong performance in cleaning capabilities, and the super-safe formulation, it justifies the investment entirely. For parents especially, where your little one‚Äôs delicate skin is concerned, it turns into a priceless resource. Is paying a little more worth the peace of mind? Absolutely, at least in my book.

1mzt1jn,https://youtu.be/9U8RGNg4nt4?si=PCSWJxdYs2AMoFLP,Cuffing Season - Quicksand [Official Music Video],"I wanted to share my experience on this set with everybody so hopefully other filmmakers can learn something. We had a VERY small location to shoot most of this video in, so lighting and camera setup was very challenging. First major issue was all of the interior lights have a mad flicker on every shutter setting we tried, so we had to use every single light we own for the shoot which was challenging but fun. We had to set all of our lights up on the exterior (which wasn‚Äôt in our initial plan) which was tough, but the building used to be a greenhouse so we were able to blast the lighting through the roof after building c stands on top of other c stands (don‚Äôt do this lol). It gave a really nice diffusion to the scenes while we were emulating moonlight. Biggest inspirations were The Bear, Moonlight, and Sinners when it comes to the cinematography. However, limited space definitely made for limited shots, so instead of getting big open wide shots we had to move to a more cinematic approach and just shoot super tight the whole time. Part of the decision to do this came from the shotlist being geared towards a large space but they cancelled on us so a friend of mine let us use her coffee shop (Shoutout to Good Shepherd Coffee Co). Pretty much everything was 50-85mm Cine lenses with the exception of some vintage glass and a Sigma Photography lens. Purpose for all the info, we overcame the setbacks of getting a smaller space and having lighting challenges by being willing to adapt. Don‚Äôt stand in the way of your own vision. Sometimes you just have to say ‚Äúwhat CAN I do NOW?‚Äù After something goes awry. ",2,1756134477.0,cinematography,1,1.0,False

Whether you‚Äôre visiting as a tourist, here long-term as a digital nomad, studying abroad like I did, or just looking for new places to try, hopefully this list helps.

These are the spots I love, the ones I take friends to when they‚Äôre in town, and the ones I‚Äôd recommend to anyone traveling here.

1mzsux6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1mzsux6/trip_report_821824/,Trip Report 8/21-8/24,"41 year olds celebrating our 20th anniversary. We like good food and historic interest points and aren't the biggest partiers in the world.

We flew into Vegas on a half empty SW flight Thursday night, picked up a Turo car in the remote lot and drove to Boulder City to stay at the Dam Hotel. Everything was fairly straightforward. Woke up early and headed to Hoover Dam around 8:15. We spent some time driving over it, looking at it from the AZ side, drove back, parked, walked around, and did the $15 visitor center experience right at opening before grabbing coffee at the cafe and heading back to town. Stopped at Hemenway Park to see the big horn sheep. Checked out of the hotel, toured their little museum. Hubs went to the brewery and I went shopping at the antique malls and Native American jewelry stores.

We left to head to the Strip around noon, did a curbside pickup at Total Wine and More before heading to Park MGM. I did the $20 trick and probably owing to my anniversary the front desk upgraded our room, waived early check in, waived parking, and gave me a $100 food and beverage credit. We ended up in a Park King Staywell room on the 23 floor (which is in the Nomad elevator bank, so that was a bit confusing).

Our first night the only thing planned was a Bavette's reservation at 5:30. We absolutely ate way too much. We started with bread, which had we realized we were going to order the steak tartare, we would not have (because that also comes with bread. We ordered steaks and two sides, and they sent out a small dessert. Every restaurant we had a reservation at I noted our anniversary and they all sent a free small dessert. After dinner we walked across the park area to NYNY and stayed awhile at Nine Fine Irishmen. The live music was fantastic and I especially loved that they take requests and occasionally there's some Irish dancing. We then went downstairs to the main bar where they have dueling pianos. It was a $10 cover but we didn't order any drinks because we really had plenty so far. Easy walk back to the hotel. 

Day 2: 10:15 brunch reservation at Bouchon (took at taxi)... It was delicious and the service attentive. I had the quiche Florentine to start and then had their lobster special (as well as a French 75). Hubs tried the escargot and the crab. We walked around the Venetian for a bit, hit the Walgreens on the way to Caesar's (I had forgotten my toothbrush, we needed cheap waters, etc). We walked around looking at the Fountain of the Gods and decided to walk to Bellagio. I sat down at a slot machine at Bellagio (wasn't going to gamble anywhere besides an MGM property) and put in $40, got up to $158, and cashed out at $133. We took the Aria tram back to hotel to rest. Housekeeping had just gotten to our room so we ended up in Eataly for gelato for a bit because I wanted to come back to a made bed later that night. We gave it 40 mins, went back upstairs to get ready for the night. We had tickets to Magician's Study (I enjoyed!), then late reservations at Sinatra (Wynn Encore). We took a taxi to dinner, took at taxi to the Bellagio to look at the fountains for a bit, and then took the Aria tram back to Park again. 

Day 3: Church, arts district (Able Baker and Peddler's Mall), Coke store, return rental, go home

Thanks for the hospitality Vegas! Also, for those wondering, it was just the right amount of crowded to me & I felt like I paid just the right amount for almost everything. 

Overall, I liked taking the taxis because it's just faster. Just walk downstairs and get in. One time I tried to take an Uber and the guy didn't pull up to the front door and had no front license plate and I didn't feel like playing Where's Waldo for 10 mins so I canceled it and got in a taxi. We sent 3 messages back and forth to each other and I didn't know where he was so BYE. ",7,1756134079.0,vegas,3,0.82,False

‚ÄúJosic, you know you screwed up, right?‚Äù Vincent Oldham‚Äôs voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

Wait, didn‚Äôt I die? she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she‚Äôd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?‚Äô Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. ‚ÄòAm I tripping again?

Imagining my crew‚Äôs here to spring me from jail?‚Äô

(29

‚ÄúLook, we get it‚Äîyou‚Äôre gunning to join Professor David Lawson‚Äôs research team. But that‚Äôs no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,‚Äù Vincent said, his tone sharp.

‚ÄúYou realize what you‚Äôve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she‚Äôs so messed up she hasn‚Äôt shown her face at school in days.

‚ÄúKeep this up, Josie, and you‚Äôre gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?‚Äù

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn‚Äôt respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn‚Äôt a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent-ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She‚Äôd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson‚Äôs elite research team.

She‚Äôd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg‚Äôs thesis was a near clone of hers-same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David‚Äôs project was a big deal-first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie‚Äôs seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs-they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie‚Äôs grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with

anger.

Josie wasn‚Äôt Natalie‚Äôs biggest fan, no lie. She‚Äôd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

‚ÄúBut if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you‚Äôre done. Expulsion‚Äôs on the table.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll apologize,‚Äù Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who‚Äôd fought his way into this school.

She‚Äôd known him longest-four years. She thought he‚Äôd have her back, trust her when she said she didn‚Äôt start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn‚Äôt cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn‚Äôt push.

‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs a deal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You‚Äôre reading it to the whole school

tomorrow.‚Äù

Josie‚Äôs lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn‚Äôt that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn‚Äôt the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she‚Äôd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn‚Äôt taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

‚ÄúThere she is-Professor Lawson‚Äôs former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department‚Äôs darling for supposedly jacking her paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in-just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.‚Äù

Look at that sour face. She‚Äôs not even in Natalie‚Äôs league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave her back? Please. They‚Äôre all Team Natalie now. This whole ‚Äòsay sorry in front of everyone thing? Aiden‚Äôs call.‚Äù

‚ÄòAiden‚Äôs idea, huh? Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She‚Äôd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who‚Äôd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She‚Äôd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he‚Äôd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.



When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She‚Äôd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ‚ÄúJosic, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

‚ÄúNever figured you‚Äôd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She‚Äôs too kind to even hold it against you.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see her after what you did. She‚Äôs a mess-skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd still, she‚Äôs got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo when you see her, you better say sorry-and mean it, okay?‚Äù

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ‚ÄúGot it, Jaden. I‚Äôll make things right with her, I swear.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould‚Äôve thought twice before pulling that stunt.‚Äù Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he‚Äôd always seen Josie as a solid kid-smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?‚Äô Jaden wondered, shaking his head. ‚ÄúWhat a letdown.

Pros:
- Active Facebook group where the company kept all backers up to date with latest developments.
- Well packaged and arrived functional, in one piece (lol)
- easy to open up and clean
- available resources on youtube created by the company
- looks and feel sturdy.
- coffee tastes different in a good way to my Eureka Silenzio. 
- 2 year warranty
- small footprint

Cons:
- magnetic cup doesn‚Äôt center too well
- screw covers are a bit flimsy and fall off
- alignment - biggest cons imo. Initially it was at 30% wipe doing the marker test and eventually with shimming managed to get it to 80-90% which will do for now. (Might just be my grinder as I haven‚Äôt read anything else on this on the fb group)

1mzsm0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mzsm0s/explore_gevi_espresso_machine_review_is_this/,Explore Gevi Espresso Machine Review Is This Compact Coffee Maker Worth It?,"Testing out the Gevi ECMG0-WH0A1 espresso machine feels like moving into a boutique coffee shop. As someone who appreciates crafting my own beverages, I approached this product with both skepticism and excitement. Designed for home and small office environments, its claim of professional-grade performance intrigued me. And after putting it through my daily coffee rituals, this machine became an essential part of my mornings. But let me walk you through its ins, outs, and quirks because, like everything else, it comes with both highlights and a few hurdles.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this espresso machine is its compact yet sleek stainless-steel design, perfect for my slightly overcrowded kitchen counter. With dimensions of 12.3""D x 5.5""W x 12""H, it sits snug without hogging space, something I imagine anyone living in an apartment or smaller home would appreciate. The full stainless-steel housing feels surprisingly premium for its price range, exuding durability and elegance. The beige color gives it a bit of warmth, blending perfectly with both modern and classic interior decor. However, the real treat is how effortless it is to maintain. The removable water tank and froth nozzle make the cleaning process significantly less cumbersome than other machines I‚Äôve tried.

**Ease of Use and Controls**  
After fiddling with overly complex machines from other brands, the semi-automatic operation of this product felt like a breath of fresh air. The intuitive buttons were self-explanatory, and the built-in pressure gauge was not only functional but oddly satisfying to watch. The brewing process was straightforward, even for someone who doesn‚Äôt stand out in the crowd as a coffee connoisseur. While trying the pre-infusion and adjustable shot volume feature, it was evident that customization was prioritized in the design. However, for those new to espresso machines, toggling with settings might initially feel like a puzzle, as the manual skimmed over details in a slightly abrupt manner.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Equipped with a 20-bar pump and NTC temperature coordination, this machine surprised me with its ability to maintain consistency. From creamy espressos to velvety macchiatos, each brew delivered caf√©-style flavor with minimal effort. I tested the pre-infusion feature, which gently saturates the grounds before extraction, allowing for more even flavors. If you‚Äôre someone who notices the subtle notes in your coffee blends, this machine won‚Äôt let you down. Operating between robust Americano drinks and silky cappuccinos, the transition was impressively seamless. My colleague, who‚Äôs notoriously picky about his latte froth, was delighted by the powerful steam wand, which consistently produced smooth microfoam. That said, the steamer does take practice‚ÄîI accidentally over-steamed my milk into a bubbly mess on day one!

**Highlights**  
- Produces consistent, caf√©-quality beverages with its 20-bar pressure.  
- Space-saving, durable design perfect for compact spaces.  
- The built-in pressure gauge adds functional precision.  
- Removable froth nozzle ensures hassle-free cleaning.  
- Versatility with drinks ranging from espressos to hot teas.  

[Check Gevi ECMG0-WH0A1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c6556g9t/)

**Weaknesses**  
As much as I‚Äôve enjoyed my experience with this compact espresso powerhouse, it‚Äôs not all roses and cappuccino foam.  
- The learning curve with the frother might challenge beginners.  
- The user manual could have provided more clarity on certain settings.  
- It‚Äôs relatively quiet compared to industrial machines but does produce moderate noise during the brewing process.  
- The water tank capacity is decent for home use but might require frequent refilling if used for entertaining guests.  

**Competitive Options**  
Having tested similar products in the past, such as the Breville Bambino Plus and the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica, I would rate the Gevi espresso machine as an excellent middle-ground product. The Bambino Plus offers slightly faster heat-up time but lacks Gevi‚Äôs pressure gauge, which helps deliver consistent results. The Dedica, meanwhile, has a slimmer profile but doesn‚Äôt quite match the stainless steel finish in terms of build quality. Though both competitors deliver strong performances, they tend to come with a higher price tag, making this product particularly enticing for budget-conscious enthusiasts who still crave high-quality coffee.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For its impressive features and aesthetic versatility, this machine offers a great price-to-performance ratio. While it won‚Äôt rival large-scale commercial models, it‚Äôs tailored precisely for those looking to enjoy cappuccinos, lattes, and espressos without stepping out of their homes or breaking the bank. Allowing everyday users to experiment with a semi-professional setup, the value Gevi delivers here extends even to the included components like spoons, tampers, and filters. If you‚Äôre debating whether it‚Äôs worth the investment, I can assure you the answer circles back to what you prioritize‚Äîinterior elegance, streamlined operation, or just solid coffee.

Chapter 1

‚ÄúJosic, you know you screwed up, right?‚Äù Vincent Oldham‚Äôs voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

Wait, didn‚Äôt I die? she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she‚Äôd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?‚Äô Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. ‚ÄòAm I tripping again?

Imagining my crew‚Äôs here to spring me from jail?‚Äô

(29

‚ÄúLook, we get it‚Äîyou‚Äôre gunning to join Professor David Lawson‚Äôs research team. But that‚Äôs no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,‚Äù Vincent said, his tone sharp.

‚ÄúYou realize what you‚Äôve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she‚Äôs so messed up she hasn‚Äôt shown her face at school in days.

‚ÄúKeep this up, Josie, and you‚Äôre gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?‚Äù

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn‚Äôt respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn‚Äôt a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent-ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She‚Äôd somehow jumped back a decade.

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson‚Äôs elite research team.

She‚Äôd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg‚Äôs thesis was a near clone of hers-same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.

David‚Äôs project was a big deal-first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie‚Äôs seniors.

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs-they all went to her.

Even David, who used to praise Josie‚Äôs grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with

anger.

Josie wasn‚Äôt Natalie‚Äôs biggest fan, no lie. She‚Äôd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.

‚ÄúYou really blew it,‚Äù Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ‚ÄúProfessor Lawson‚Äôs giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie

in front of the whole school, and he‚Äôll let it go.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you‚Äôre done. Expulsion‚Äôs on the table.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll apologize,‚Äù Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who‚Äôd fought his way into this school.

She‚Äôd known him longest-four years. She thought he‚Äôd have her back, trust her when she said she didn‚Äôt start this drama.

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.

29

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn‚Äôt cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn‚Äôt push.

‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs a deal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You‚Äôre reading it to the whole school

tomorrow.‚Äù

Josie‚Äôs lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.

She wasn‚Äôt that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.

But that wasn‚Äôt the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.

In her old life, she‚Äôd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.

Not this time. She wasn‚Äôt taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt be her.

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.

‚ÄúThere she is-Professor Lawson‚Äôs former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department‚Äôs darling for supposedly jacking her paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in-just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.‚Äù

Look at that sour face. She‚Äôs not even in Natalie‚Äôs league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave her back? Please. They‚Äôre all Team Natalie now. This whole ‚Äòsay sorry in front of everyone thing? Aiden‚Äôs call.‚Äù

‚ÄòAiden‚Äôs idea, huh? Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.

She‚Äôd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.

Jaden was a first-year grad student who‚Äôd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She‚Äôd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he‚Äôd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She‚Äôd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ‚ÄúJosic, I always thought you were one of the good ones.

‚ÄúNever figured you‚Äôd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She‚Äôs too kind to even hold it against you.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see her after what you did. She‚Äôs a mess-skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd still, she‚Äôs got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo when you see her, you better say sorry-and mean it, okay?‚Äù

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ‚ÄúGot it, Jaden. I‚Äôll make things right with her, I swear.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould‚Äôve thought twice before pulling that stunt.‚Äù Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up.

Deep down, he‚Äôd always seen Josie as a solid kid-smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind.

So how the hell did she think screwing someone over for a spot was okay?‚Äô Jaden wondered, shaking his head. ‚ÄúWhat a letdown.

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson‚Äôs office.

1mzsjhf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzsjhf,1971 AMC Hornet: The Oddball Muscle-Adjacent Compact You Can‚Äôt Help But Love,"# üêù TL;DR: The 1971 AMC Hornet 304 V8 is a forgotten V8-powered compact with big ambitions from a tiny automaker. Born in a time of transition, it blends muscle car attitude with economy car intentions‚Äîand today, it stands as a lovable oddball that‚Äôs slowly gaining cult status.

The **1971 AMC Hornet** isn‚Äôt just a footnote in American automotive history‚Äîit‚Äôs a full chapter in the story of how a scrappy underdog tried to punch above its weight.

With its compact footprint and available **304 cubic inch V8**, the Hornet offered muscle car flavor on an economy car budget. But to appreciate the Hornet, you need to understand **AMC itself**.

# üè¢ A Quick History of AMC

**American Motors Corporation (AMC)** was formed in 1954 by the merger of Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson‚Äîtwo independent carmakers trying to survive the postwar Big Three squeeze.

AMC was always the underdog, and it leaned into that role with bold design, weird advertising, and left-field product decisions. They were responsible for:

* The **Gremlin** (the first American subcompact)
* The **Pacer** (widebody before it was cool)
* The **Eagle** (an AWD wagon before the Subaru craze)
* And yes, the **Hornet**

AMC‚Äôs strategy? Be small, weird, and punch above your weight class.

# üöó The 1971 Hornet: Compact Muscle?

The **AMC Hornet debuted in 1970**, but 1971 brought the exciting option of a **304ci V8** paired with a **3-speed automatic**. That made it one of the *lightest V8-powered sedans or coupes* you could buy at the time‚Äîoffering surprising torque in a very understated wrapper.

The design? Simple, angular, clean. AMC designers weren‚Äôt chasing chrome or sweeping lines. The Hornet‚Äôs sheet metal was slab-sided and almost brutalist‚Äîbut it had charm.

AMC positioned the Hornet to compete with:

* The Ford Maverick
* The Chevy Nova
* The Dodge Dart

‚Ä¶but with an available V8 and AMC‚Äôs offbeat branding, the Hornet always felt like the weird cousin at the family barbecue.

# üè≠ Production & Assembly

The Hornet was built at AMC‚Äôs **Kenosha, Wisconsin** facility, and it shared platforms with several other AMC creations like:

* The **Gremlin**
* The **Spirit**
* The **Concord**

That platform adaptability was key for AMC‚Äôs survival and innovation.

# üì∞ Reception at the Time

While not a sales juggernaut, the Hornet received praise for:

* Its tidy handling
* Its V8 performance in a small package
* Its competitive pricing

But it wasn‚Äôt a muscle car, and it wasn‚Äôt quite a commuter either‚Äîwhich made it hard to pigeonhole in the early ‚Äô70s automotive landscape. Still, the **Hornet stood out** for offering real performance and practicality from a company not afraid to be different.

# ü§ì Why People Love AMC Oddities

AMC fans are a special breed. They love cars that never quite fit the mold. And the Hornet checks all the boxes:

* Rare
* Weird
* Underdog story
* Capable of V8 power

The **304 V8 Hornets are especially desirable** because they give you muscle-era sound and feel without the six-figure price tag of a Chevelle or Mustang.

# üí∏ Collector Value & Long-Term Desire

Values on AMC Hornets‚Äîespecially **V8-equipped 1971 models**‚Äîhave been rising *quietly*. Why?

* They‚Äôre rare. Clean survivors are hard to find.
* Parts support is improving.
* Gen Z and Millennial collectors love obscure stuff.
* AMC‚Äôs cultural legacy is getting more respect.

They may never be $100K auction queens, but a clean Hornet V8 today is a car that:

* Turns heads at any Cars & Coffee
* Sparks conversations
* Might just be a **smart collector buy** in a market where weird is wonderful

# üéØ Final Thoughts

The **1971 AMC Hornet 304 V8** wasn‚Äôt just a compact car‚Äîit was AMC‚Äôs attempt to inject horsepower and edge into a market dominated by the Big Three. Today, it‚Äôs a rare survivor of an era when the little guy still had big dreams.

It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs underappreciated. And that‚Äôs exactly why people are falling in love with it again.

Background: M36, 5'4, Caucasian, About 220-230, Type 2 Diabetic

Medications: Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, Metformin, Jardiance and Mounjaro (new, replacing discontinued Bydureon Bcise).

About 2 days ago, I had a sore neck (Pain level 1-2 tops), not stiff, not hurting at all when stationary or applying pressure, can move without much pain, assumed I slept on it wrong.

Last night, I had a coffee pretty late to finish my shift, and came home from work around 2 a.m. Went to the bathroom and then sleep by 3 a.m.

Around 5 a.m., after 2 hours of vivid REM sleep, I was jolted awake by moving shakes and teeth chattering. The teeth chattering isnt exactly new, it occasionally comes in momentary spells and always assume its the 'Betes affecting the nervous system. But this was different; I stood up to use the bathroom and the shakes would move from my shoulders to my hips to my knees. It wasn't a seizure, I was in control of my body's primary functions and could walk around, but I was shivering like I was locked in a meat freezer.

Scared about what it could be, I made my way to my car fully prepared to go to the ER and the shakes subsided. Maybe lasted like 3 to 5 minutes in total as it came in waves. Haven't had it since but also haven't been able to go back go sleep. Neck has a dull ache, but no stiffness and pain level is incredibly low.

My gut reaction is assuming I slept bad on my neck again and may have put pressure on a nerve that sent my system into shakes, or perhaps this is a side effect from Mounjaro, which i started on Saturday. I am sure the late night caffeine, which I almost never do, didn't help either.

I feel relatively fine now, but the experience shook me up. I don't want to go to the ER if I absolutely don't have to (I don't want to delay care for those who need it more), but if this is something y'all think needs to be checked out ASAP, then I'll make my way over.",1,1756133315.0,AskDocs,2,0.67,False

The first week I've noticed these bumps on my private. I knew that I have to see a doctor. So I went to a public STD clinic and have them check, if what I have is something that I've already suspected‚ÄîHSV2. Though my doctor at that time couldn't accurately diagnosed me with Herpes since they lack the necessary equipment to test me. She still put me on acyclovir for a week to see how it goes. And it disappeared after a few days. 

For weeks I've been down almost to the point that I'm starting to lose all hope for myself. I've become obsessed with the disease, had me staying all night checking all the threads, all the research and all possible treatment just so I can stay sane. 

I still haven't gotten to the clinic the doctor recommended. But after having my first and now second outbreak‚Äîdrank too much coffee. I've finally given up the possibility that it could be something else and ultimately accepted the truth. 

I guess the reason why I'm writing this right now is to be honest with myself. 

I don't hate me for having this, I don't blame me, nor point a finger to anyone. Albeit sad at times but there's nothing I can do. It's already here, and it's the truth. 
It's not the end of my life. I'm still gonna go to that doctor and see what I can do to lessen these outbreaks. And that's it.

Using the Gain 30772092095 for the first time instantly turned my laundry routine around. This liquid detergent, infused with the captivating Moonlight Breeze scent, delivers a long-lasting fragrance that genuinely feels like a breath of fresh air. I remember pulling a towel from the cupboard two weeks after washing, and it still had that freshly-laundered, invigorating scent. For someone like me, who loves keeping fabrics smelling amazing without additional sprays or softeners, this detergent was right on target.  

**Cleans Stubborn Stains Surprisingly Well**  
Even though the scent was a huge win, what really surprised me was the Oxi Boost cleaning power packed into this formula. It tackled set-in stains from coffee spills and splattered sauces with ease, something I usually struggle with when using other brands. My kid‚Äôs PE uniforms and socks, often caked in dirt, came out spotless as well, which is no small feat considering their typical state. Based on my experience so far, this product‚Äôs enzymes and surfactants work as promised, even on older, stubborn dirt.  

[Find the best price for Gain 30772092095 on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0c9gwxm8n/)  

**Perfect for All Kinds of Wash Cycles**  
What stood out to me is how versatile this detergent is. Most detergents lose effectiveness in cold water, but Gain‚Äôs formula is specifically designed to work well in all kinds of cycles, whether hot, warm, or cold. I tried it on delicate settings, tossing in my favorite silk scarf, and even then, there was no compromise on cleaning. It‚Äôs rare to find a detergent that handles everything from heavy-duty loads to delicate fabrics with consistent results, yet this one manages it all beautifully.  

**Benefits**  
- Captivating Moonlight Breeze scent lasts up to six weeks.  
- Effectively removes set-in stains and two-week-old odors.  
- Compatible with all types of washing machines (even high-efficiency ones).  
- Works wonderfully in cold water cycles, saving on energy.  

**Possible Shortcomings**  
Despite my satisfaction, there were a couple of things worth noting.  
- The detergent‚Äôs concentrated formula requires careful measurement to avoid using too much.  
- The packaging can feel bulky, especially if you have limited storage space.  

**Other Options**  
For those who are loyal to other brands, Tide‚Äôs liquid detergent with Febreze is a reasonable alternative. While it also excels in cleaning power, I felt it fell slightly short in maintaining fragrance over time compared to Gain. Persil ProClean, another comparable option, specializes in removing ultra-tough stains but lacks the wide variety of scents Gain products offer. However, if fragrance ranks lower on your priority list and ultra-deep cleaning is all that matters, these alternatives might suit your needs better. Yet, few match the scent and versatility Gain brings to the table.  

**Quality for Price**  
Given its performance and unique features, Gain delivers excellent value for its price. While it may come across as slightly pricier than some budget-friendly detergents, the combination of lasting fragrance, effective stain removal, and compatibility with all washing systems makes this a worthwhile investment. You‚Äôre essentially getting detergent and a long-lasting fabric freshener in one product. For me, that‚Äôs a deal hard to pass up.

Criticising my entire existence. Everything, all of the things imaginable, non imaginable things included as well, were criticised. Like literally, she even criticised my future.

Now this is where the fun starts. For the past 2 months I just started acting like how she wanted. I let her control everything.  

There is nothing left to criticise anymore, since everything I do/have is decided by her. She can't criticise her own decisions.

Although this is problematic in some areas like no bedroom doors and windows. Or no sugar, coffee and salt and only 4 hours of sleep everyday.  

But this acts as motivation, I have started working hard to earn enough to move out. It is do or die time, God speed to freedom.

‚ÄúJosic, you know you screwed up, right?‚Äù Vincent Oldham‚Äôs voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.¬†

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.¬†

Wait, didn‚Äôt I die? she thought.¬†

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she‚Äôd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.¬†

So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?‚Äô Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. ‚ÄòAm I tripping again?¬†

Imagining my crew‚Äôs here to spring me from jail?‚Äô¬†

(29¬†

‚ÄúLook, we get it‚Äîyou‚Äôre gunning to join Professor David Lawson‚Äôs research team. But that‚Äôs no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,‚Äù Vincent said, his tone sharp.¬†

‚ÄúYou realize what you‚Äôve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she‚Äôs so messed up she hasn‚Äôt shown her face at school in days.¬†

‚ÄúKeep this up, Josie, and you‚Äôre gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?‚Äù¬†

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn‚Äôt respond.¬†

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.¬†

This wasn‚Äôt a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent-ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She‚Äôd somehow jumped back a decade.¬†

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson‚Äôs elite research team.¬†

She‚Äôd crushed it, landing a spot in the final round.¬†

But then came the sucker punch: Natalie Kinberg‚Äôs thesis was a near clone of hers-same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence.¬†

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire.¬†

David‚Äôs project was a big deal-first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie‚Äôs seniors.¬†

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family.¬†

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late-night study sessions, the laughs-they all went to her.¬†

Even David, who used to praise Josie‚Äôs grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil.¬†

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with¬†

anger.¬†

Josie wasn‚Äôt Natalie‚Äôs biggest fan, no lie. She‚Äôd been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight.¬†

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing.¬†

‚ÄúYou really blew it,‚Äù Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. ‚ÄúProfessor Lawson‚Äôs giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie¬†

in front of the whole school, and he‚Äôll let it go.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you‚Äôre done. Expulsion‚Äôs on the table.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll apologize,‚Äù Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his.¬†

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who‚Äôd fought his way into this school.¬†

She‚Äôd known him longest-four years. She thought he‚Äôd have her back, trust her when she said she didn‚Äôt start this drama.¬†

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow.¬†

29¬†

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn‚Äôt cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn‚Äôt push.¬†

‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs a deal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You‚Äôre reading it to the whole school¬†

tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

Josie‚Äôs lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk.¬†

She wasn‚Äôt that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie.¬†

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her.¬†

But that wasn‚Äôt the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace.¬†

In her old life, she‚Äôd refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie.¬†

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation.¬†

Not this time. She wasn‚Äôt taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt be her.¬†

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology.¬†

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut.¬†

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side-eyes trailed her like a bad smell.¬†

‚ÄúThere she is-Professor Lawson‚Äôs former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department‚Äôs darling for supposedly jacking her paper.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShe thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our five campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in-just as smart, drop-dead gorgeous, and actually nice.‚Äù¬†

Look at that sour face. She‚Äôs not even in Natalie‚Äôs league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHave her back? Please. They‚Äôre all Team Natalie now. This whole ‚Äòsay sorry in front of everyone thing? Aiden‚Äôs call.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄòAiden‚Äôs idea, huh? Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip.¬†

She‚Äôd barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up.¬†

Jaden was a first-year grad student who‚Äôd saved her bacon back in her senior year. She‚Äôd been floundering in her toughest classes, and he‚Äôd tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams.¬†

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all-nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She‚Äôd never owed him or any of the guys a thing.¬†

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. ‚ÄúJosic, I always thought you were one of the good ones.¬†

‚ÄúNever figured you‚Äôd pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She‚Äôs too kind to even hold it against you.¬†

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see her after what you did. She‚Äôs a mess-skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd still, she‚Äôs got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down-low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you gotta have a heart, yeah?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo when you see her, you better say sorry-and mean it, okay?‚Äù¬†

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. ‚ÄúGot it, Jaden. I‚Äôll make things right with her, I swear.‚Äù¬†",1,1756133013.0,Novelnews,1,0.66,False

1mzsc72,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mzsc72/does_the_bella_electric_can_opener_sage_model/,Does the BELLA Electric Can Opener Sage Model 17582 Truly Deliver? Review,"The BELLA 17582 Electric Can Opener and Knife Sharpener found its way onto my kitchen counter, and I‚Äôve been digging into its practicality over the past few weeks. This sleek sage-colored gadget promises multiple functionalities, and as someone who exists at the intersection of being a kitchen enthusiast and despising manual chores, I figured it was worth a solid go. Let me share my insights from using it to hack through cans, pop stubborn lids, and keep blades sharp.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The first thing I noticed is how compact and visually appealing this appliance is. Its sage color pairs beautifully with nearly any kitchen d√©cor‚Äîit‚Äôs both understated and modern. With measurements of 3.93 inches in width and 7.87 inches in height, it saves countertop space without sacrificing functionality. Despite its lightweight frame (just around 1.7 pounds), the stainless steel finish gives it a solid feel. The cutting lever comes off easily for cleaning, a feature I was genuinely grateful for after dealing with the aftermath of opening a can of overly zealous baked beans. Overall, its neat cord storage and smooth design mean it doesn‚Äôt hog space when not in use.

**EFFORTLESS PERFORMANCE**  
This can opener doesn‚Äôt mess around‚Äîits 60-watt motor ensures even the most stubborn cans are no match. I decided to really test it out with various can sizes and lid types, including one of those annoying pull-tab cans that mock you when the tab breaks off. With the auto-turn feature, I barely had to touch the device beyond placing the can and pressing the lever. The experience felt seamless; no awkward jams or half-cut lids. While popping open a tomato soup can one morning, even my pre-coffee brain was impressed by how little effort it required.

**Check [BELLA 17582 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09zvlgbh4/)**

**MULTIFUNCTIONAL CONVENIENCE**  
What surprised me most was the integrated knife sharpener. I had several neglected kitchen knives that hadn‚Äôt seen love in years, and to my genuine delight, this device did a decent job of bringing them back to life. It‚Äôs not a professional-grade sharpener by any means, but for everyday utility knives, it more than suffices. Add to that its ability to unsnap jar lids and bottle tops‚Äîparticularly those that make me consider calling a friend for backup‚Äîand you have an appliance that really earns its spot in a busy kitchen.

**STYLE MEETS UTILITY**  
Apart from the sheer functionality, the product scores bonus points for being available in multiple colors. I chose sage because it complements my kitchen, but if you favor bolder shades, BELLA offers those, too. The aesthetic appeal makes it an excellent choice for housewarming gifts or wedding registries. Who wouldn‚Äôt love a tool that combines vibrant vibes with practical cooking efficiency?

**UPSIDES**  
- Compact design with cord storage keeps the countertop tidy.  
- Easy-to-clean removable cutting lever.  
- Handles various can sizes, from tiny tuna cans to oversized containers.  
- Built-in knife sharpener is a handy bonus.  
- Multiple color options to match different kitchen themes.  

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
- The knife sharpener is suitable for everyday knives but may not satisfy more demanding tasks.  
- Some users report occasional inconsistency with the magnet holding lids in place.  
- While the stainless steel blade is durable, it would be even better if extra replacement blades were available.  

**PRODUCT COMPETITORS**  
I‚Äôve been using this alongside another electric opener‚Äîthe Hamilton Beach Heavy Duty Opener. While the BELLA gadget boasts a sleek and colorful design, Hamilton Beach leans more into industrial reliability and can handle larger cans with slightly more efficiency. That said, I found the BELLA cuts more smoothly, minimizing sharp edges on lids. In terms of knife sharpening, BELLA wins for convenience; not many openers blend those two functionalities into one handy device. A careful inspection of both made me appreciate BELLA's removable lever for easier cleanup, an area where Hamilton Beach can be tricky because of its fixed parts. On price points, though, things even out‚Äîboth offer decent value depending on what fits your style and kitchen needs.

**VALUE PROPOSITION**  
Is this gadget worth the investment? I‚Äôd say it holds its own in terms of cost-effectiveness. Considering the time and convenience it saves, especially for anyone who despises manual openers, it‚Äôs a solid pick. While more traditional tools might come cheaper, the added value of knife sharpening and compact storage makes this appliance a winner in my book. That it does all this while looking good feels like a cherry on top.

Case A: Bloom (being the first), then second pour, third, and so on. Crystal clear way of thinking, thus more standardized.
Case B: Bloom, then the first pour (albeit technically the 2nd).

Personally I always find the case A to be more logical and not prone to any misunderstandings (especially when teaching for beginners).

However, I also agree that when we choose to brew with specialty-level coffee, doing pre-infusion becomes an imperative step. I mean sure, you do you, don't let me tell you what to do. Not many gonna actually enfore this rule irl. And yet for most of us here, we all do it eventually, so I'm not gonna be mad if we use that latter logic more often. Let's say it's the pour number 0.

[**A Poetry Reading by Crystal Simone Smith**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/a-poetry-reading-by-crystal-simone-smith/)¬†at¬†**Horton Grove at Historic Stagville**  


* This free public reading will be outdoors on the grounds of Horton Grove, beside the historic slave dwellings. The reading will be followed by an author Q and A and book signing.
* Smith's poetry reimagines the experiences of enslaved and formerly enslaved persons in a stark and chilling response to the archives of chattel slavery: bills of sale, interviews, narratives, and fugitive runaway ads. Embodying the aesthetics and Japanese poetic forms haiku and tanka, her poems bear witness to the brutal and horrifying treatment of enslaved people and contrast their humanity with the inhumanity of their enslavers.
* In these poems, fugitive persons evade slave patrol hounds by climbing magnolia trees, use the cover of night and the detritus of a shipwreck to swim to freedom, and find temporary refuge in a cabin where a woman offers bread and water. Throughout, Smith poignantly envisions their flights to freedom‚Äîpassages that were fueled by love, hope, and impossible dreams. She unceasingly gives voice to those who found courage in both bondage and freedom.
* Parking is in a grass lot off of Jock Road. This program includes walking less than 100 yards over uneven grass or gravel to reach the reading location. In case of rain or inclement weather, the program will be moved into the visitors center at 5828 Old Oxford Highway. Chairs will be provided for attendees.

# Understanding the Basics of Point of Sale Systems for Small Businesses

## Introduction

Question: What exactly does a POS system do?

As a small business owner, you‚Äôve likely heard a lot about point-of-sale (POS) systems. But you might still be wondering, ""What exactly does a POS system do?"" This is a common question and an important one, as the right POS system can streamline your operations, improve customer service, and boost your bottom line. 

## Direct Answer

A point-of-sale system is a combination of hardware and software that allows businesses to conduct sales transactions. It‚Äôs not just a fancy cash register; a POS system tracks sales, manages inventory, processes payments, and can even keep customer data organized.

### Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Sales Transactions**: A POS system records every sale, whether it's a latte at your caf√© or a pair of shoes at your boutique. This data helps in keeping track of what's selling and what isn‚Äôt.

2. **Inventory Management**: It automatically updates inventory levels with each sale, saving you the hassle of manual entries. You'll know when it‚Äôs time to reorder stock, preventing overstock or stockouts.

3. **Payment Processing**: Modern POS systems can handle various forms of payment, including cash, credit/debit cards, and mobile payments. It ensures transactions are processed securely and efficiently.

4. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: A POS system can store customer information, track purchase history, and even implement loyalty programs. This helps in creating personalized marketing strategies.

## Breakdown / Scenario Example

Imagine you own a quaint caf√©. During the morning rush, a customer orders a cappuccino. Your barista keys in the order on the POS system:

1. **Order Entry**: The system records the sale immediately and sends the order to the kitchen for preparation.

2. **Payment Processing**: The customer pays with their debit card. The POS system processes the payment instantly.

3. **Inventory Update**: After the cappuccino is served, the inventory count for coffee beans and milk is automatically adjusted.

4. **Data Storage**: The customer's purchase is now recorded, and if they are a regular, their favorite drink might come up as a suggestion next time they visit.

## Quick Takeaways

- A POS system is integral for recording sales, managing inventory, and processing payments.
- It automates inventory management, ensuring you know exactly when to reorder stock.
- The system securely processes multiple payment methods, enhancing customer convenience.
- It helps track customer data, which can be used for personalized marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

In essence, a POS system is much more than a tool for handling sales; it's a comprehensive solution that can drive efficiency and growth for your small business.

Figured I'd share what worked (and what didn't) since some of you might find this useful.

**What I tracked:**

* Permit data from LADBS
* Crime trends from LAPD datasets
* New business licenses (coffee shops, gyms, etc.)
* Transit development timelines
* Social media sentiment analysis around neighborhoods

**The wins:** Highland Park called it 6 months early when I saw the permit surge + new business clusters. Venice adjacent areas lit up my models before the recent run-up. Even caught some pockets in the Valley that are just starting to move now.

**The misses:** My AI was way too bullish on anything near the Expo line extensions. Turns out infrastructure promises ‚â† immediate neighborhood transformation. Also completely whiffed on how much rising rates would slow everything down.

**Biggest surprise:** The social sentiment analysis was actually the most predictive signal. When local Facebook groups and Nextdoor chatter shifted from complaints to excitement about new businesses, prices followed 4-6 months later.

**The reality check:** This isn't some magic crystal ball. AI just helped me process way more data than I could manually track across 100+ LA micro-markets. Still comes down to boots-on-ground validation and understanding local dynamics.

Why is it not more popular?,"It all started with me trying to dial in decaf. It was hard to reach a consistent non-burnt taste. Ended up doing finer (not much) grind sizes, and using just 2/3 of water and the other 1/3 just topping up the final brew. (Filter and aeropress, whichever is not on the dishwasher at the time)

This to me yield a more consistent, sweet forward brew, without the harshness you can get on decafs (might be skill issue, but hey, anything that makes it easier counts!)

So, now I started playing with the idea on my normal brews. Went a couple of notches finer on a natural process, and proceeded with same technique.

To my surprise, I found that I could feel much more of the complexity of the coffee, but avoided most of the ‚Äútoo fine‚Äù issues I‚Äôd have if I tried to just ‚Äúreduce agitation‚Äù and so on.

My theory is that with more water passing through the beans, you might extract more but you also can take more of the bitter ‚Äúpowdery‚Äù compounds. Having it finer but less water going through counter balances it. But that‚Äôs a uneducated guess

1mzs1mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1mzs1mj/tips_from_a_disney_world_regular_visiting/,Tips from a Disney World regular visiting Disneyland Paris,"I just got back from Disneyland Paris and wanted to share some thoughts/tips, especially if you‚Äôre used to Walt Disney World like I am. I went during an incredibly busy time, so crowds were very high ‚Äî but I still managed to do everything I wanted (and then some).

‚ú® Dining

100% book your restaurants in advance. I was so glad I did ‚Äî Chez R√©my was adorable, and Walt‚Äôs was absolutely amazing.

As an FYI: I used Thrill Data dining alerts to snag some hard-to-get reservations and it worked great.

I had the half board plan through my hotel, and it was worth it as a U.S. visitor. It saved me money and took the stress out of meals.

One thing that surprised me: food locations close early in the parks. I wanted popcorn or a snack near closing and most stands were already shut down at least 30 minutes before park close. Some quick-service spots were closing an hour before close. So don‚Äôt wait until the end of the night to grab food.


‚ú® Fireworks & crowd control

I highly recommend the reserved fireworks viewing. I did it twice and it was amazing. People line up for hours and block walkways, and honestly Disneyland Paris has way less crowd control than Disney World. The reserved area is right in front of castle, totally amazing.


‚ú® Photopass

I skipped it and I‚Äôm glad I did. There are way fewer photographers than at Disney World, so it just wasn‚Äôt worth it.

‚ú® Premier Access Ultimate & lines

I bought the Premier Access Ultimate for two days but really only needed it for one. It was fantastic for hitting all the big rides with little to no wait.

That said, the line dynamics at DLP felt really different than Disney World. For example, I expected the Avengers roller coaster (Avengers Assemble: Flight Force) to have a massive line, but it really didn‚Äôt. Meanwhile, some smaller rides had 30+ minute waits all day.

Also, Premier Access wasn‚Äôt always a time saver ‚Äî on WEB Slingers, the PA line merged back in with the regular line right after the preshow, so there wasn‚Äôt much advantage.

The only downside overall: it doesn‚Äôt include some of the Toy Story rides like RC Racer, which consistently had long waits.


‚ú® Shopping

Merchandise is more geared toward younger kids compared to Disney World.

The best shop for adults was Disney Style in Disney Village ‚Äî lots of great finds there.


‚ú® Hotel & tickets

I stayed at the Art of Marvel Hotel in the Empire State Club and it was amazing. Gorgeous theming, great service, and the room was large and comfortable.

I booked a hotel + ticket package directly through Disneyland Paris, which bundled my park tickets with the stay.

One thing that surprised me: unlike many U.S. Disney hotels, there wasn‚Äôt really a grab-and-go food option (like quick sandwiches, snacks, or coffee stands). I‚Äôm used to that being standard at Disney World, so just something to plan for if you like easy food on the run.

If you have time, pop into the Disneyland Hotel (right at the entrance to Disneyland Park). It has beautiful art, a cool merchandise shop, and a really nice bar. Totally worth walking inside even if you‚Äôre not staying there.


‚ú® Castle, shows & facilities

The castle is stunning. I went during early magic hours and got beautiful pictures with no crowds ‚Äî highly recommend.

The shows were a highlight ‚Äî I‚Äôd see them all again, except the Alice in Wonderland one (it was a little too corny for me).

Toilets near the busiest areas were crowded and annoying. It was worth checking the map and walking to the more out-of-the-way restrooms ‚Äî those were much less hectic.

As a Star Wars fan, I loved the Hyperspace Lounge in Discoveryland near Star Tours. The droid was a fun surprise, and yes the drinks and cookies are overpriced, but totally worth it for the experience.


‚ú® Final thoughts
Even in peak crowds, I did everything I wanted (and more) thanks to planning meals, using Thrill Data dining alerts, Premier Access, and grabbing reserved fireworks spots. Booking a hotel + ticket package also made things smoother. Disneyland Paris has a different vibe than Disney World ‚Äî less polished crowd control, more unpredictable wait times, earlier food closures, and yes, even bathroom lines ‚Äî but it also has more charm in other ways (that castle alone üòç). If you‚Äôre a Disney World vet heading over, go in with flexible expectations, and you‚Äôll have an amazing time.

1mzs0vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/1mzs0vy/len√ß√≥is_maranhenses_trip_report_dos_donts_for/,Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses Trip Report + Dos & Don‚Äôts for Visiting (Santo Amaro base),"I just got back from a Brazil trip with my wife and brother-in-law that included a mini-vacation in Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses, and wanted to share some tips + what our experience was like. We stayed in **Santo Amaro do Maranh√£o** (as opposed to Barreirinhas or Atins) and based ourselves at *Casa Armonia*, which we booked through Booking, but is also available on Airbnb. Highly recommend this pousada. The host, Elaine, was incredible: super communicative, helped us book everything, and even went out of her way to sort out payments when we couldn‚Äôt easily use the Brazilian Pix system. We opted out of breakfast at the beginning, which was R$50pp and included traditional Brazilian goodies + fruits, but she surprised us with free coffee on our last couple of days. Simple accommodations (big room with two beds, AC, a fridge, and a nice shower), but honestly, all you need since you‚Äôre out on tours most of the time.

# Getting There

* We flew into S√£o Lu√≠s, which is really the only option. From there, it‚Äôs about 3.5 hours to Santo Amaro.
* Elaine set us up with a private driver, **Will Transfer**, who had a super comfortable car *and* Starlink internet (lifesaver, since service is basically dead most of the way). We stopped halfway for bathrooms and food, then got into town around 10 pm.
* **If you‚Äôre going**: contact your pousada/Airbnb host directly to arrange transport. It‚Äôs way easier than trying to figure it out yourself. You can also rent a car, but please note that most of the drive there is on a single, one-lane stretch of highway with terrible asphalt and speed bumps every few hundred meters, which may or may not cause your car to bottom out. Additionally, given the cell service, you *may* get lost if you don't have a way of using offline maps. 

# The Tours We Did

1. **Am√©ricas Tour (with Joaquim Am√©rica)**
   * Afternoon tour, \~R$160pp. Pickup in a 4x4 truck, then a boat ride out to a giant lagoon in the dunes. You can wander around and swim until sunset.
   * This is where we randomly ran into Americans we had met at the airport and ended up becoming friends, having dinners together, and doing the rest of the tours with them.
   * Great ‚Äústarter‚Äù tour and a must for the sunset views.
2. **Bet√¢nia Tour (all day)**
   * Starts at 9 am, same 4x4 pickup. Had to buy **park wristbands (R$10 each)** to enter through the official park entrance.
   * The plan was 4 lagoons + lunch + sunset lagoon. Cost \~R$160pp, but **lunch and boat transfer to the restaurant were** ***not*** **included.**
   * It rained most of our day, so we ended up skipping one lagoon, but still had plenty of time at the others.
   * Long, full day. Bring lots of sunscreen if you plan on swimming at each lagoon.
3. **Quadbike Tour (with Cassio)**
   * This was our favorite. Private tour with just us + guide. Options: R$600 beach, R$700 full day, R$350 half day (per quadbike + guide‚Äôs quadbike).
   * We did the half-day (already exhausted from previous days) and started at 3 pm. Paid in cash upfront. Went to 2 lagoons, swam for about an hour each, and again finished with a sunset.
   * Adrenaline + flexibility + fewer crowds = worth it.

**Pro tip:** Each tour went to totally different lagoons, so it never felt repetitive. And all included a cooler of bottled water.

# Dos & Don‚Äôts

**Do:**

* Contact your host directly for rides/tours. Seriously, they‚Äôll save you a ton of hassle.
* Have **cash or Pix** ready. Card payments weren‚Äôt accepted for most tours.
* Try the local fruits (pitaya, caj√°, etc.) and **Guaran√° Jesus** (a bubblegum-flavored guaran√° soda originally from S√£o Lu√≠s).
* Use **VIVO** if you need cell service with an eSIM. It was the only provider with decent coverage.
* Expect food prices closer to U.S. levels in town (though we did find one cheap lunch spot).

**Don‚Äôt:**

* Count on reliable power/internet. The town had a few outages while we were there, which also killed cell service. Totally out of the host‚Äôs control, but something to be aware of.
* Expect English to be spoken widely. Guides and locals mostly spoke only Portuguese. I‚Äôm Brazilian, so I ended up translating for our group.
* Bring a jacket (like I did). The region is very close to the equator, so it will, without a doubt, be **hot.**
* Book tours in USD before arriving, as they will be way more expensive.
* Do the helicopter tour. Our driver told us that his friend owns the helicopter, which is not very well maintained and occasionally patched up with non-aviation-approved materials

# Final Thoughts

Len√ß√≥is is one of the most unique places I‚Äôve ever seen. The lagoons, dunes, and sunsets are insane, and everyone in my family in Belo Horizonte was mesmerized after seeing the photos and videos we captured on our tours. Additionally, S√£o Lu√≠s has a beautiful historic district that you must visit if time allows it.   
  
All in all, make sure you go in prepared: book with a reputable host, arrange transportation ahead of time, and bring cash. If you do that, you‚Äôll have an unforgettable trip.",2,1756132176.0,Brazil,1,0.75,False

Hey all! üòÑ

Okay‚Äîlet me just say: the last few months flying through the world of *no code automation* has legitimately left me buzzing. Think about it. What used to be a slog of late-night debugging, API tangling, and yelling at permissions settings... is now often just a juicy drag-and-drop away.

Here‚Äôs what keeps making me absolutely *giddy* about this stuff:

- Your expertise no longer needs to be tied to a programming language. *Your ideas* are the jet fuel‚Äîno more ‚Äúbut I can‚Äôt code!‚Äù roadblocks.
- Solopreneurs and indie hackers? You‚Äôve never had more freedom to test, launch, and grow.
- The classic script errors? Typos? Syntax slip-ups? Ya, they‚Äôre starting to fade into the past, like floppy disks or dial-up tones.

But‚Äîwhat really excites me is seeing how much *everyone* is embracing automation, no matter their background.

- Marketing teams now set up personalized drip campaigns in a morning and ‚Äúif this, then that‚Äù automations before lunch.
- Educators automate course reminders, auto-grading, and community-building‚Äîwithout wrangling code or IT help.

And seriously, have you *seen* the toolkits? Zapier. Make (formerly Integromat). Airtable‚Äôs Automations. Notion + Buttons. And, of course, several of the GPT-powered tools people here are constantly cooking up!

YES, there are challenges.

- Platform limitations (why can‚Äôt my favorite app work with EVERYTHING yet!?)
- The dreaded ‚Äúhidden limits‚Äù on tasks/actions/bandwidth.
- And sometimes, the logic for even a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù workflow? Surprisingly mind-bendy! (Anyone who set up a multi-step approval chain knows what I‚Äôm talking about.)

*But* all this change means we are living through a shift in how we work and what kinds of things we can create, together. Automation isn‚Äôt just for the technical folks anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs turning into a playground for anyone who‚Äôs ready to experiment.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm curious about:

**What‚Äôs YOUR favorite or weirdest ‚Äúno code‚Äù automation you‚Äôve set up?**  
Anyone else see certain jobs changing (or just getting *better*) thanks to all this?  
Funny stories about automations that went haywire? (Bonus points for coffee-related ones!)

Me and my wife have always loved Italy and wanted to move to Italy, and finally we decided to make a first step - we're doing sort of ""dry run"" and renting appartments in Genoa for a month, a city that really appealed to us. We'll be living two weeks in Castelletto and another two weeks in Albaro/Sturla.

The thing is, we would like to try the real Italian lifestyle, with all its pros and cons, not only in a way that's shown in all sorts of beautiful movies, but the way it really is. We're not going as tourists, we're going to work remotely in our current jobs 9-to-5, and besides that time... yep, actually what besides that time?

How does everyday life look in relatively big Italian cities (we'll be in Genoa, but I guess it's not massively different from Milan or Bologna)? During our multiple vacation visits in Italy, in the mornings there were always bars full of people, sitting and drinking coffee, reading papers or just watching the street for hours. In the evenings, seems like literally everyone in the city was out in the restaurant, spending time with friends. Is this picture real? In my country (also EU and big city, but much further north) the default way of spending free time is mostly at home, only occasionally going out with friends.

What's worth doing out of ""everyday activities"" during our stay? How to make sure if life in Italy actually is or isn't good for us?

It would be probably also nice to meet some people, what would be the best way to do it? We're not experts in Italian, but we can definitely handle everyday conversations. We're not introverts, we like meeting people, but neither are we super-extrovert type of people that would tap a shoulder of a random person in a bar and say ""let's get to know each other better"" :) Maybe renting some coworking space of a couple of days would be a good idea, are place like this popular in Italy?

Sorry if the questions are a bit naive, but we'd really like to get the most out of this month.",3,1756132091.0,Genova,2,0.8,False

1mzrwbr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzrwbr,23M - Completed my first versatile fragrance collection for the moment,"After a lot of research, decanting, thinking, I have completed my humble full-bottle collection of fragrances covering all requirements/occasions. 

1. Versace Dylan Blue Pour Homme
Arguably one of the best blue fragrances out there. A compliment magnet, lasts and projects incredibly well on my skin, very refreshing, aromatic, spicy. Like a manly shower gel. Perfect for the day outings and dressing up during summer heat.

2. Versace Pour Homme
This fragrance screams a clean sexy man. A rich man who always grooms himself and is put together. Clean, sexy, non-offensive, a no-brainer fragrance. Women absolutely love this, and as much as we tend to search desperately for fragrances that will impress women, this simple fragrance beats 99% of other ones out there. I'd be surprised if any woman or man finds this unattractive on a man. I use this for office/professional settings, occassionally for gym/errands, and so on.

3. French Avenue Aether Extrait
This is very affordable, to begin with. A very close clone of PDM Greenly. The atomizer is itself extremely high quality and impressive. The scent is very green, lot of woods, green apple, a hint of spices, very fresh like you're in the middle of an aromatic green wet forest. I use this as a daily wear perfume, you can easily over spray this because of it's price, it is well suited for heat/summers/indian climate. Works for gym, errands, anytime you need a simple fresh, moderate lasting, inoffensive affordable scent. No need to worry about this scent being cloying or intense, and the beautiful bottle is an added bonus! :)

4. Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Le Parfum
This is extremely sexy, seductive, just makes you wanna sniff again and again, certainly lures in the ladies haha. Perfect for winter, date nights, dressed up occasions in cold weather. If the climate is cold, i blindly reach out for this fragrance, not to forget, this is a long lasting fragrance. The smell of clothes the next day after you spray this fragrance is just what I live for, honestly this is just addictive.

5. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa
Sweet, gourmandy, vanilla, spicy, with the touch of that dark roasted coffee. This is simply an awesome sweet winter fragrance. Perfect for those late night functions or marriages or traditional ocassions. I feel like this goes very well with our traditional clothes, the vibe just feels perfect. Lasts and projects like a beast, smells very seductive, provided you are careful and limited with your sprays. 2-3 sprays is more than enough. Also works well on those winter nights when you just want to go out and have fun!



That's it, that's all one needs according to me. I know this hobby is an expensive wallet drainer, so you need to learn when to stop. I already have a lot of other fragrance decants but I don't consider them as part of my collection as they probably are going to last me around 5 uses.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Jenson Brooksby vs. Aleksandar Vukic ‚Äì A US Open Tale of ""Almost"" and ""Not Quite""**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a match that reads like a tennis version of *The Odd Couple*‚Äîone a brooding, inconsistent powerhouse, the other a scrappy underdog who‚Äôs mastered the art of ""showing up, then disappearing."" Let‚Äôs dissect the upcoming 2025 US Open first-round clash between **Jenson Brooksby** and **Aleksandar Vukic**, where the stakes are high, the odds are tighter than a shoelace in a hurricane, and the humor is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say Vukic‚Äôs served it.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Losers

First, the numbers. Brooksby, the 23-year-old American, is the slight favorite across most books, with implied probabilities ranging from **70.5% (BetMGM at +1.36)** to **73.5% (MyBookie.ag at +1.39)**. That‚Äôs not just a lead; it‚Äôs a *statistical stranglehold*. Meanwhile, Vukic, the Serbian journeyman, floats between **32% and 34%** implied odds, which is about the same chance as winning the lottery if you‚Äôre betting on Powerball with a blindfold.

The spreads are equally telling. Brooksby is favored by **4.5 to 5.5 games**, which in tennis terms is like saying he‚Äôs expected to win a set while Vukic sips tea and watches. The total games line hovers around **36.5-37.5**, suggesting a match that‚Äôs either a nail-biter or a snoozefest‚Äîdepending on whether you‚Äôve had three cups of coffee or three naps.

---

### Recent Form: A Shared History of Heartbreak

Brooksby‚Äôs recent form is a mixed bag. He‚Äôs lost three of his last five matches, including a third-round exit to Karen Khachanov in Cincinnati. His US Open r√©sum√©? A four-time first-week exit, with the highest he‚Äôs ever climbed in New York being the fourth round‚Äîlike a man who‚Äôs mastered the art of ""almost.""

Vukic, meanwhile, is the tennis equivalent of a ""one-hit wonder."" He‚Äôs also

Could I get fired for this?,"About a year ago, I got a fully remote job as a project coordinator at an MNC. The interview process was very difficult ‚Äì behavioral rounds, a case study, and a final interview where I had to explain how I would manage several projects at the same time. This made me feel that the job was fast-paced and involved a lot of activity, which scared me a bit.

But today, I'm sitting in my house at 10:30 in the morning, drinking my coffee and looking at my calendar, and I realize that I have... nothing urgent to do. Again.

The first month was hectic. I set up the project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined the way our team updates weekly reports. My manager was impressed and told me I was a ""genius"" for creating automated reminders for overdue items.

After that, things calmed down. Once that initial setup was done, my daily work decreased and became a matter of a few emails, occasional meetings, and a few ""urgent"" requests.

In meetings, I'm almost completely zoned out. I suggest to people that they start using AI (granola) to summarize the meeting and come up with action items. My 50-year-old director told me I was a ""techie"" for doing that. Dude, I don't even like technology that much.

Last week, my manager asked me if I remembered a decision we made two months ago - I typed a keyword into the second brain setup I have (saner) and got her the answer instantly. Then she asked me if I have a ""photographic memory."" Lady, I don't even remember my friends' birthdays.

Most of my time now is spent making it look like I'm busy. I leave a GDoc page with lots of details open during any Zoom call so it looks like I'm working myself to death.

I schedule messages on Slack to be sent at the end of the day, even though I finish them in about... 20 minutes, for example.

Sometimes I feel guilty because of how little I actually do.

I've started new hobbies. I learned to make fresh pasta. I started decorating my house. I've read more books this year than I did in the last two years combined.

Every once in a while, I panic that my manager will notice and fire me in this wave of silent layoffs that's happening, but last week she told me I'm doing ""fantastic work and keeping everything running smoothly."" So... I'll probably just keep doing what I'm doing?

1mzrprt,https://www.reddit.com/r/riseandglow/comments/1mzrprt/the_secret_to_lower_stress_more_confidence/,The Secret to Lower Stress & More Confidence ‚ú®‚òÄÔ∏èüåø,"Just like we set intentions for our life, we must set intentions for each day. Otherwise, the day will just happen, we‚Äôll go through the motions, and be reactionary. 

Setting intentions is different from planning your activities. Setting intentions is knowing how you‚Äôll show up for the day and planning activities is knowing what you‚Äôll do.

Journal, speak it out loud, whatever works for you. This is part of your conditioning process to become the person you want to be.

Intention precedes feelings.

When you know what to expect, you‚Äôll feel more secure and less stressed. The day will bring surprises that you cannot control, and when this happens, you can stay calm and true to the intentions you already set for yourself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How to set intentions (with examples)

**1. Set an overall intention for the day.**

""Today I will...""

üòå ‚Äúbe present in each moment‚Äù

üïØÔ∏è ‚Äúfocus on what I can accomplish and not what isn‚Äôt done.‚Äù

üôè ‚Äútrust the process of life/my journey/the universe.‚Äù

**2. Look at your day ahead and set intentions for your activities.**

üè° Helping a friend move - how do you want to show up? 

‚ÄúI will be of absolute service to my friend today. I will be joyful and willing to work until the job is done. I am thankful for my friend and the opportunity to help her in a time of need.‚Äù

üöó Picking kids up from school - how do you want to show up? 

‚ÄúI will be the mom I want my kids to remember. I will be present with them and not distracted with my own thoughts on the drive home. I will be curious and ask specific questions about their day and I will show interest in what they tell me.‚Äù  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When you set these intentions each morning, you can do it in whatever style feels most true to you. It will only take a few minutes, so don‚Äôt skip over it. 

Make it a habit at the same time each morning, like when you sit down with a cup of coffee or right after your shower. At first, I suggest writing them in a journal (even if it‚Äôs just words or bullet points) and saying them out loud. It may feel funny, but just do it. There is power in outwardly establishing these statements. You can also write them on sticky notes and put them around where you will see them during the day to remind yourself.

üåü When you set intentions, you can mentally prepare your mind each day to be better and better and over time, you will naturally become better and better.

üåüIf you have a challenging activity coming up in your day, mentally prepare yourself ahead of time. Close your eyes and imagine yourself and your mindset at the start of the activity, in the middle, and at the end. Imagine any difficult points or challenges that you may face during it. Know how you will respond or navigate, know what you‚Äôll say to keep yourself going, know what you‚Äôll do when you hit a snag, know what your mindset will be and your next move. And lastly, imagine yourself at the end of the activity, when you are finished and it‚Äôs completed. This will cause you to become familiar with possible factors during the process ahead and allow you to think more clearly about and be more confident in your response.

üåü Choose joy. Sometimes, stress and anxiety will be your first response and that‚Äôs ok. We don‚Äôt get to choose our emotions because they are automatic, physical, and impulsive. But we can choose how we feel when the emotion passes. Feelings are a conscious choice. Choosing joy will take practice and work. Once the initial emotional response washes over you, you will know what you will do and how you will respond because of the intentions you set ahead of time. (examples: think of a past or future event, hope, situation, etc. that brings you joy, anything at all. Or change your environment and movement - go for a walk, journal, listen to music, call someone you love.) You have the power to choose your reality and you can prove that to yourself in this moment.

üåü When you consider your intentions for the day, keep others in mind. What or who do you want to be to them? What experience do you want others to have when they are around you? Know how you will show up. Be intentional with your attitude and your behavior. Prepare yourself for possible situations that could arise and know how you will handle them.

üåü Make up a cute motto for yourself so that it‚Äôs easy to remember and aligns with your intentions.

**Following Through**

Try this: think of the goals you‚Äôve previously set in your life. The level of your follow through (or lack of follow through) on those goals directly influences your confidence and stress levels today. This has subconsciously set the standard of how much stress and uncertainty you can handle.

Your mind and your body know your patterns.

* If you continuously say you‚Äôre going to do something and you don‚Äôt do it, that‚Äôs teaching your subconscious that your word and your commitment cannot be trusted. Unsurprisingly, this creates stress and anxiety that is difficult to calm. The more distrust in your life, the more distress you will have.
* If in the past you have followed through on your word and you completed the commitments you made, you have created a sense of trust within yourself. You can be confident that you will follow through on responsibilities.

Decide to break the pattern of distrust. Your limiting beliefs and old patterns have been conditioning you up until this point. Now it‚Äôs time to change your trajectory.

Set yourself up to win. Make goals that are big enough to excite you and attainable enough that you know you can achieve it. Write your goals or activities down. Check them off as you complete or accomplish them. You‚Äôll create a sense of trust within yourself because you‚Äôll be proud of the accomplishment you truly made.
