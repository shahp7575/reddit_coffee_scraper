Or just a weird panic attack? Idk how to bring it up aside from just straight up reading from a paper,"Going to talk to a therapist in a few days. 

(ugh so beforehand part of me was thinking there were likely substances in the coffee at home so I wasn't drinking it partially cause that). And I was having a bunch of paranoia on campus but seemingly if i drank coffee once every few days it would stop the paranoia seemingly but then I'd just have paranoid thoughts occasionally like people were recording me on campus and being watched from places that weren't possible physically. 

  
Skip forward to yesterday I was studying for an exam I didn't study well for...everything was kinda fine. (Tbf I felt a bit spacey the day before and before i left i went to youtube and felt like youtube was sending me specific videos to form my opinions).... 

  
Welp went to campus started studying and I decided to get some coffee after 2 weeks of very little caffine... and after studying for a bit I guess the coffee hit? But (this isn't perfectly chronological) idk I thought 2 people knew what was in my mind, made a post somewhere and someone said they had a stroke reading it(idk i felt/feel like what i'm writing is flowing pretty fluidly except this bit) 

I chatted with a friend I didn't see in a while and then a song came on and it felt like it was way too close to what I was thinking to be accidental and then this guy was singing and for some reason my brain was telling me to ask him to stop telepathcially switching the music... and it sounded louder like everything was just loud so I went to sit outside which was nice. Thought I could hear god or someone mumbling through the sound that was likely a plane(idk the sound was all really grating) Oh and I looked at my thumbs and my hands were covered in warts which now just look like regular skin featuers. 

The 2 people I saw earlier walked by... same thing with the mind reading. Kept thinking I saw movement. Went to the exam unprepared and all of that felt like it stopped? The cameras inside were bugging me and I felt like I needed to escape and felt like not going back home after campus cause I failed the exam and cause I kept thinking that the drinks at home were drugged and I think i heard someone talking which has increased after I quit coffee  (sometimes it stops if i drink coffee sometimes it doesnt but usually i feel like i'm listening in on a room somewhere that sometimes theres chatter in and if i tell myself its not actual chatter theres like something element of it being contradictory) 

Left the testing center, breathed, walked on campus and felt like others were going to get my personal bank and other sensitive info walking by me 

Drove home listening to music and it was fine? Had 0 caffeine today and its all fine... ): so have been feeling like things are lowkey crawling over me after quitting coffee and I'm feeling it alot right now but I think its mostly when standing... 

100% should've written this in a journal instead of here but what the heck 

and its not the first time i've had kinda similar... and then a small period of realizing oh yeah no I was 100% wrong... on the plus side yeah no it wasn't some substance in the coffee causing me issues... or any of the drink or food here... (which made me be like oh maybe the barrista put something in but... due to reasons nah. ) 

Right now just sitting here honestly not on campus and even without the coffee I got alot of paranoia (but I used to feel spiritual entities a lot which stopped mostly after I stopped drinking a cup or two a day)

Its fine now I mean I felt like checking myself in somewhere before the exam then it ended..slightly worried i might get into issues if i'm honest about literally everything with said therapist

1jro33a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1jro33a/very_unpleasant_side_effects/,Very unpleasant side effects,"Hi, I’ve been on 100mg SR for 8 days. The first couple of days were fine, but now I’m extremely irritable, my head feels heavy like a bowling ball, and theres a pressure, and I can’t focus on anything, which is affecting my work. It’s also hard to form words and connect my thoughts, and I just feel like I’m in a strange imbalance. At the same time, I feel like I’m on a weird high but also just want to crawl into bed.

A couple of days ago, I posted about the sudden body jerk feeling I get when falling asleep (it still feels horrible), but the side effects have gotten worse since then. I can’t take Bupropion at night because of it, and I’m wondering if caffeine (I drink coffee in the morning and usually caffeinated drinks throughout the day) could be making it worse? Has anyone had this experience?

I was prescribed Bupropion alongside Zoloft for libido issues, and I’m considering increasing the dose of Bupropion, but I’m worried about even worse side effects.

Any advice or similar experiences would be really helpful. Thanks!

1jro2eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1jro2eh/why_cant_i_loose_weight_helpp/,WHY can’t I loose weight?! helpp!,"(18F) ok so I turned 18 a couple weeks ago and decided that I’d try to get into better shape. I have a ok body I suppose but I wanted to even my proportions because use my shoulders are broad and my hips are way too narrow for my liking and I wanted to loose some more weight (mainly in my arms and legs Because my parents said they noticed me gaining weight because I eat a LOT) For reference I am 5’10 and my starting weight was 125 lbs but it fluctuates a bit. so I just decided to go on a diet of 500 calories a day until I’ve seen results. I’ve seen people do way more and get amazing result. Ive been doing this for a little over 2 weeks.

I will be honest I’ve gone over two or three times hitting 700-800 cals some days, but for the most part I’ve been consistent. I do what all the diet people say and drink a lot of water and I try to work out but it’s hard because I don’t have a ton of energy and I heard coffee messes with your stomach when it’s empty. So I walk a lot mainly around my neighborhood and campus. Anyways I eat every day round 4-5pm and maybe a snack before (that’s usually when I’d go over). My mom mostly cooks relatively healthy meals for me and my family and I cook too. Also we don’t eat fast food too often. And when my mom doesn’t cook I eat oatmeal and an egg because that keeps me full the longest.

so at the end of the two weeks I check the scale (my starting was 125) and I lost TWO pounds?! I for real almost cried I don’t know why I did that just to loose two pounds LMAO. I’ve seen people do stuff like this and loose 5-7! And I see absolutely no physical difference! I’m still doing 500 cals a day but idk what I should change about this diet to make me loose weight faster. Should I use all of my calories during breakfast? Or should I split it up? I really don’t think I can go lower than this though I’m not sure it would be healthy. I’m thinking about using appetite suppressants at this point. because idk what I’m doing improperly but my mom keeps saying she notices my legs getting bigger :v so any advice is appreciated because turns out I’m pretty clueless about weight-loss and diets and stuff ",0,1743804338.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.5,False

As a frequent customer, I will throw my hat in the ring, and say that the connection cafe deserves more credit than it gets. 
       In my justification, it offers good service when compared to its price. For ten dollars, or less, we can get access to a plethora of freshly-made dishes and drinks, including but not limited to: Coffee, tea, desserts, salads, soups, and a wide variety of main courses. 
       Ultimately, I felt satisfied with the service, considering that other spots around campus offer smaller portions and less healthy options at a higher price. Biggest deal breaker? No tipping required.

1jrnzst,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1jrnzst/kitty_kisses_cat_cafe_plays_defense_on_detractors/,Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe Plays Defense on Detractors Who Have Felt Deceived,"# In photo, a feral cat colony in Sparks, Nevada, amid local divisions among those trying to help cats in need in the community, with one initiative facing heightened criticism from others.   

After we posted an article last month about a Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe post warning two black cats at their location could “go back to the streets,” more members of the community have come forward with concerns about how the Double R Blvd location conducts business more generally.

Complaints range from unexpected charges added onto credit cards after visits, not feeling welcome with children, confusion over the existence of a for profit model alongside charity donations, animosity with other local cat related organizations and why cats are being flown in from Hawaii while area cats are in need. 

Kallie Laity bought what used to be called the Enchanted Cat Cafe lounge from its founders Devin Sizemore and Haley Meadows for whom she had previously worked for, reportedly for $80,000 in July 2022, plus monthly interest.  

We asked Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe about these concerns as well as the location’s financial setup, to which we received an email which indicated: “With all due respect, some of these inquiries would require the divulsion \[sic\] of sensitive, proprietary information which we will not address. Answers to other inquiries are public record, have been previously shared to our audience, or are untrue or irrelevant.” 

Concerning the cats from Hawaii the email indicated: “Not only is Kitty Kisses partnered with rescues in Hawaii (since May 2024) who are absolutely inundated, we partner with rescues including but not limited to Washoe County Regional Animal Services, Community Cats of Reno, Fallon Animal Control, and Friends of Normie in LA - Kitty Kisses was instrumental in helping during the fire in January. We also accept owner surrenders. While Kitty Kisses is based in Northern Nevada, we will not turn away an urgent request for help from rescues located elsewhere, as long as we are sure that our local community is not struggling too!” 

A graphic we were emailed above concerning the separation between non profit and for profit. 

On the Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe website, when we last checked, the second hyperlink was for Kitty Kisses Rescue of Reno a non profit “charity organization serving Reno, NV that focuses on cat welfare and resources.”   The email indicated this non profit status was granted in late February 2024 and announced in June 2024, “as much preparation needed to be completed.” 

  
The kittykissescatcafe Instagram page had as some of its bio wording “Reno’s 1st & only Cat Cafe & Rescue (nonprofit) since ’22!” mixing the two concepts there, as well as using the same physical space.  

The email addressed the separation of the for profit and non profit sections by pointing us to an Instagram post from March which indicated “lately, we’ve noticed a misunderstanding, so we’re here to clear it up.” 

A graphic indicated the cat cafe donates cat lounge space to rescue partners and hosts adoptable cats, while the non profit handles adoption inquiries and approvals. 

An additional graphic included in the email indicates money raised by the non profit is not used by the cafe.  

On several pages of the website, there’s the design of a pink cat indicating underneath that there have been over 300 adoptions via Kitty Kisses.  There’s an adoption process page with different flyers for different cats, and a graphic indicating adoption fees are $110 for adults and $125 for kittens, followed by pictures of people hugging and petting adopted cats.  

The website indicates that tickets are required for cat lounge access, with pre-booked tickets with a credit card at $15 for adults for a 50 minute visit, kids ages six to 17 the same, but with the caveat they must be accompanied by an attentive adult and as of April first kids 0 to five no longer allowed.  

Same day tickets are priced at $18, with monthly and annual memberships also available.  On the Plan Your Visit page, there’s a waiver to sign and on the right in pink a Rules When Visiting section, indicating “You will be asked to review these rules again before entering the Cat Lounge” with titled and underlined “EVERY guest must read EVERY rule. EVERY visit.”  There are 14 bullet points and added disclaimers at the bottom.

A shoe policy has its own detailed flow chart diagram, which asks visitors to bring a separate, clean pair of socks or for adults to use borrowed slippers or shoe covers. 

There’s two more sheets concerning children with one indicating that youths six to nine will only be allowed on Sundays going forward.  

A recent review said they thought the prices were steep, including the four to five dollar per coffee at the cafe and that they went with a roommate, “thoroughly read the guidelines and really didn’t do much expect just walk around and look at them \[the cats\] running around. Couple days later I get a bill for $5 because I apparently broke some rules…. What a ridiculous excuse to make a few extra bucks … This place blows.”

In a response the Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe owner wrote back “although you claim to have read our rules, they were not followed. As a result, authorized incidental charges were incurred.” 

There have been multiple angry comments concerning Kitty Kisses on both Yelp and Google Reviews. Several recent low star Yelp reviews were replied to by “Kallie L. Business owner” saying the person’s name was not found in the waiver or scheduling system,  “which leads us to believe this is a false review” was one reply.  

Extra charges showed up “for apparently breaking the rules,” Rose Tollar-Rae wrote recently about feeling deceived.  “When I asked what rules were broken, I did not get a response. We were extremely respectful and honestly this is just kind of ridiculous.”

Another, Michael Cohen, wrote about an extra $42 on his credit card, and after threatening to write a bad review, he says he was banned.  “Apparently they watch, and take notes, and then charge you extra money afterwards,” he wrote. 

Kaycee Daniel said she paid over $50 on treats and entry and then was charged an additional eight dollars.  “It is a pattern, other people with children in the reviews are all experiencing the same thing,” Daniel wrote.  “They will claim your child was being bad without giving specifics.”

“This place has so many weird rules and policies, it’s as if the owner would rather not have any customers…” Nick Thiessen wrote.  “For example, if you bring a kid that’s 5 years old or younger, you must HOLD THEM the entire time, otherwise they will tack on additional charges.”

Those younger kids are no longer allowed, as noted above.  Many of these negative reviews get answered with lengthy responses which are viewable online.  

A part of the website we were referred to as part of our questions. 

Others in the community concerned about cat welfare say that if customers are disruptive they should just be kicked out rather than charged after the fact.  Some who have complained about Kitty Kisses on its Instagram page say they are immediately blocked.  Other visitors have said they paid to enter the cat lounge but then were denied the possibility of adopting due to different reasons.   

In the email from Kitty Kisses it was indicated “paying to visit the Cat Lounge at the Cat Café allows a guest to visit the Cat Lounge for a session; it does not guarantee adoption approval, a process handled by the Rescue. Most of our guests visit socially.”

For local cat lovers operating in these spaces, who said they had high hopes for the place initially, the high number of feral cat colonies in northern Nevada is a challenge, as well as difficulties to access spay and neuter resources, and extremely tight windows with the SPCA of northern Nevada in getting appointments . The one nonprofit veterinary clinic which gets rave reviews Options is severely backed up as well.  Feral colonies start when an unfixed cat is left outside, starts breeding, and then babies grow up to have their own. 

“There are feral cat colonies locally although they are not managed by WCRAS so we don’t have any data about euthanasia rates for local community cat colonies,” Quinn Sweet from the Washoe County Regional Animal Services wrote back to us when we asked about these, followed by a list of “organizations that manage colonies locally: Community Cats, Feral at Heart, Nevada Humane Society, Options Veterinary Care and SPCA of Northern Nevada.”

One organization which used to work with Kitty Kisses, the Fernley-based Precious Paws Society of Nevada, an animal resource and rescue non profit group indicated in an email from Barbara Thompson, “we severed all ties with them in Dec of 2024. We no longer have any of our cats or kittens being fostered and showcased there at the cafe.” No additional details were offered.  

After sending a follow up email to Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe, we received an email responding “Kitty Kisses ended the partnership via email on December 4th, 2024, due to a difference in values. The partnership was no longer mutually productive.” 

Feral at Heart, a local Trap-Neuter-Return organization also does not work with Kitty Kisses due to past difficult interactions.  TNR is an effective method for managing community cat populations by humanely trapping cats, spaying or neutering them, vaccinating them, and then returning them to their original outdoor location. This decreases the risk of disease transmission, improves the health of cats and reduces the need for euthanasia.  

On a recent Facebook post on the Kitty Kisses Resources of Reno public group, Laity listed several other TNR organizations, such as groups operating in Fallon and Winnemucca but not Feral at Heart here in Reno.  

Feral at Heart, a non profit, which traps an average of 250 to 350 cats per year here locally, also puts up cats for adoption and helps with resources on how to trap and save feral cats. 

Concerning criticism from members of the community, the email from Kitty Kisses said “We strive to foster an environment in our space that is safe, kind, respectful, and positive and hope that this attitude emanates to the entire Reno area. Unfortunately, there are others in the local animal rescue field who are not of the same mindset. We do not wish to engage in a false narrative about our entities. Unlike them, we do not participate in the futile act of attempting to disparage other rescues in the area.”

Text messages and emails shown directly to Our Town Reno have accused Laity of giving her own bad reviews to other local businesses involving people she’s had difficult interactions with.  One local business owner who wished to remain anonymous told us directly that Laity then apologized to them and took down reviews.

“We would like to see the text messages; we do not acknowledge baseless claims or accusations,” Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe wrote back when asked about this.  

While we were finishing up writing the story,  we received another email from Kitty Kisses indicating “materials have been fabricated in the past,” while we had been referring to text messages shown to us discussing her conduct.

In the email from Kitty Kisses it was indicated “paying to visit the Cat Lounge at the Cat Café allows a guest to visit the Cat Lounge for a session; it does not guarantee adoption approval, a process handled by the Rescue. Most of our guests visit socially.”

For local cat lovers operating in these spaces, who said they had high hopes for the place initially, the high number of feral cat colonies in northern Nevada is a challenge, as well as difficulties to access spay and neuter resources, and extremely tight windows with the SPCA of northern Nevada in getting appointments . The one nonprofit veterinary clinic which gets rave reviews Options is severely backed up as well.  Feral colonies start when an unfixed cat is left outside, starts breeding, and then babies grow up to have their own. 

“There are feral cat colonies locally although they are not managed by WCRAS so we don’t have any data about euthanasia rates for local community cat colonies,” Quinn Sweet from the Washoe County Regional Animal Services wrote back to us when we asked about these, followed by a list of “organizations that manage colonies locally: Community Cats, Feral at Heart, Nevada Humane Society, Options Veterinary Care and SPCA of Northern Nevada.”

One organization which used to work with Kitty Kisses, the Fernley-based Precious Paws Society of Nevada, an animal resource and rescue non profit group indicated in an email from Barbara Thompson, “we severed all ties with them in Dec of 2024. We no longer have any of our cats or kittens being fostered and showcased there at the cafe.” No additional details were offered.  

After sending a follow up email to Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe, we received an email responding “Kitty Kisses ended the partnership via email on December 4th, 2024, due to a difference in values. The partnership was no longer mutually productive.” 

Feral at Heart, a local Trap-Neuter-Return organization also does not work with Kitty Kisses due to past difficult interactions.  TNR is an effective method for managing community cat populations by humanely trapping cats, spaying or neutering them, vaccinating them, and then returning them to their original outdoor location. This decreases the risk of disease transmission, improves the health of cats and reduces the need for euthanasia.  

On a recent Facebook post on the Kitty Kisses Resources of Reno public group, Laity listed several other TNR organizations, such as groups operating in Fallon and Winnemucca but not Feral at Heart here in Reno.  

Feral at Heart, a non profit, which traps an average of 250 to 350 cats per year here locally, also puts up cats for adoption and helps with resources on how to trap and save feral cats. 

Concerning criticism from members of the community, the email from Kitty Kisses said “We strive to foster an environment in our space that is safe, kind, respectful, and positive and hope that this attitude emanates to the entire Reno area. Unfortunately, there are others in the local animal rescue field who are not of the same mindset. We do not wish to engage in a false narrative about our entities. Unlike them, we do not participate in the futile act of attempting to disparage other rescues in the area.”

Text messages and emails shown directly to Our Town Reno have accused Laity of giving her own bad reviews to other local businesses involving people she’s had difficult interactions with.  One local business owner who wished to remain anonymous told us directly that Laity then apologized to them and took down reviews.

“We would like to see the text messages; we do not acknowledge baseless claims or accusations,” Kitty Kisses Cat Cafe wrote back when asked about this.  

While we were finishing up writing the story,  we received another email from Kitty Kisses indicating “materials have been fabricated in the past,” while we had been referring to text messages shown to us discussing her conduct.

Between 2,3,or 4 of us we regularly do things together: bars, dinner, coffee, gym, yoga, helping each other move, vacations, concerts, etc. Recently 2 just moved into the same apt building together, we'll call them Anna and Beth. We all live within 10 minutes walking of each other downtown in a major city, which is also why we can easily spend so much time together.

Since Anna and Beth moved into the same building, they've been spending more time together obviously, but doing things that normally we would all do together, or at least throw out to our group chat i.e. hey I'm in the mood for sushi for dinner who else is down?  There's been like 3 distinct times this has happened just in the last month. 

\-A few weeks ago I was texting Beth about this new bar we wanted to check out and what time we wanted to meet up, and she told me 'oh actually Anna is having a pregame at her place so I'm going to that first'. My response: why didn't she say anything? Beth just says 'Anna just told me about so I just told you'. Ok sure maybe. ('Cate' was out of town at the time)

\-We have a group of friends who hold monthly listening parties. I haven't been to as many as the rest but I have been to a few. The most recent one, 'Cate' told me that she and Anna and Beth were all going and wanted to see if I was coming too. At no point did Anna or Beth actually mention it to me. 

\-The other night Anna and Beth went out to one of those public first friday block party type things, which Beth and I specifically talked about going to when we missed it last month. And again, they didn't say anything about them going. 

I am a very blunt person so I'm planning on reaching out to them both individually just to ask like hey did I do something or?? But I also feel so childish worrying about something like being 'left out' and am just worried I'm overthinking what could really just be a bunch of coincidences. Any opinions/device?

However, I notice some strange panicking feeling sometime. Last week I was in a meeting at work and after taking a cup of coffee (I normally dont drink cafeine) I got some kind of panic attack and started shaking. Went to the ER and they found nothing. I thought it was the cafeine.

However the next day I also got it at work halfway through the day. I was very tense because of that and could barely keep myself out of a panic attack by breathing exercises etc. Today I had a day off and it started again. I already called the cardiology department and the doc will call me back.

What could this be? It feels like my breathing 'stops' for a moment, like my body forgot to breathe. Sometimes it feels like I inhale but it does nothing. Then there is this immediate panic reaction from my body.

Recently was hospitalized for 11 days...had a first/bad flare up of pancreatitis out of nowhere. They couldn't figure out a reason for it, so they assume it's alcohol. I don't have gall stones, am not diabetic, am fit, etc. I didn't eat a good diet, however. I was drinking white wine when it happened...I'm a moderate drinker (drank a whole lot more when I was younger). Had some complications in the hospital (unrelated to the pancreatitis), but some collateral inflammation (one of my lungs). Been home for a little more than two weeks and am back to work...however, I'm not back to normal. Pain in my lower left back when I breath in suddenly (kinda sharp pain)...had xrays which showed some scarring in my lung (for a little while I had to be on oxygen in the hospital...had a fever, too) but the doc thinks the pain is just muscular (ChatGPT thinks it's related to the lung, but that it will improve over time and that there isn't any necessary treatment for it). I'm still anemic and some of my other blood work is out of whack (slightly increased Amylase levels). 

I'm back on a normal diet, but I'm not drinking caffeine, alcohol, and keeping it low fat. I'm ravenous and would kill for a slice of deep dish cheese pizza, but it's not in the cards for now. I'm terrified of this happening again. The hospital stay was awful...a lot of pain and a lot of oxy.

My questions for those of you who have had repeated occurrences of acute pancreatitis...what (if anything) prompted the additional flare ups? I don't plan on going hog wild, but is it likely I can have a more normal diet at some point (normal yogurt, maybe a slice of thin crust cheese pizza, a small side of french fries, a cup of normal coffee with cream)? I'm not planning on moderately drinking anymore...is a beer now and then playing with fire, though (I prefer Guinness, which has a relatively low ABV%)? Also, how long did it take for your blood work to go back to normal? Specifically, my red blood cells, platelets, etc. have been off track (but slowly and steadily improving each time we check). Has anyone had only one acute flare up and that has been it?

Would love some feedback. Thank you!",2,1743803407.0,pancreatitis,0,1.0,False

They're dark, oily and very rich. I get them bulk from a store in Fort Collins CO called Natural Grocers. I've only really ever liked a super dark bean and all the times l've
tried light, fruity, flowery roasts I simply thought people had no taste or that's not how coffee SHOULD taste. I don't care what bean or flavor anyone likes anymore. What I find at times is that opinions on roasts and beans can get out of hand.

Too many strong opinions of what's right and what's wrong. l'm old enough to not give a shit much anymore and I don't care about all the nuances involved. I care
that the places that grow and process the beans treat their people well and provide a safe environment to work. Coffee with will it's flavors is about what matters to us individually.

I've mentioned in other posts I have a raw milk subscription for heavy cream. I froth the cream each morning and add it to my dark roast coffee. lt's one of the most delicious things in the world, to me.

1jrno7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jrno7q/more_sorce_special_order_window_reviews_this/,"More Sorce special order window reviews! This group is the B List, if you will.","With the Ajevie restock, I set out to try all the Special Order Window Sorce scents. I posted a bunch of reviews already, and I started with the ones that were most promising. So this is the remainder. FWIW, Sorce is typically a very high hit rate for me… so the following reviews don’t reflect my typical feelings for Sorce- I wouldn’t have tried everything if I didn’t totally obsess and adore!

TBH I truly had no business trying some of these because of the notes, but I am a completionist (and Sorce does surprise me!) so here we are. Others I sniffed in the vial and went “oh… oh no” and set them aside for later.

Well, here we are, later! Hold my perfume, I’m going in. 

(Ft. A few review-bombs by my husband, who wanted to sniff my wrists and give his increasingly weird opinions.)

Relevant dislikes: see below. Relevant likes: not here. J/k, srsly tho some of my favorite Sorce scents are Something Wicked, A Match Made in Heaven, Strings of Light in the Forest, Serpentine, Snow Moon Magic, The Things Unsaid, A Party or Something and Seance. 

**C’est Noel** - Wow, this is apropos for most of my family Christmas experiences, come to think of it. Cursed holiday. It smells like burning! Legit. Cremated cinnamon toast with some scorched coffee, with a hint of salt- I think that’s the snow note. (Husband: “Burnt… cinnamon?.”) *Coffee, freshly baked cinnamon bread, roasted chestnuts, blown out candles, lingering church incense, and softly falling snow* 1/5

**Crystal Prism** - I actually had hopes for this one- I like elderflower liqueur; ambroxan is usually my friend, and I love a good bergamot. And I don’t actually hate this one! I just don’t like it much either… it’s the sage, it always reminds me of roast chicken, and apparently I prefer elderflower as a flavor and not a perfume. It’s quite herbal overall, with a hint of the Sorce vanillaroma under it all. Bright spring green, says my synesthesia! If you like herbal perfumes, worth a try. It is a morpher as it dries down too; I rather like it later on as the herbs mellow. *French elderflower CO2, bergamot, natural sage and cypress leaf oils, ambroxan, and a hint of tonka bean and vanilla* 2.5/5

**A Bump in the Night** - I was also lowkey hopeful here; the strawberries, honey and cream could be nice!  I get the honey, actually, with a little strawberry. This honey is a slightly animalic one- which Bees was too on me. It’s *violently* smokey, with some crotchy honey under it. That smoke note really does have a slight band aid edge to me, IDK why. I did manage to leave it on for an hour and would say it’s the least abusive of all the smoke note ones; lo and behold, the skank wears off and smoke chills out, and it is in fact lovely . Quite the rough ride to get there though! Husband’s take: “peanut butter on fire.” *Roasted strawberries with mascarpone cream and golden honey, pecans, burning leaves* 0/5 for the first hour, 4/5 after that.

**A Light in the Attic** - This smelled like burnt band aids to me, it’s an unholy synthesis of the juniper, the smoke and the leather. Scrubber. *Dry vanilla, smoke, fallen leaves, suede, juniper leaf, almond, resins, a hint of maple syrup.* 0/5

**Mermaids Sing of Lost Lovers** - This is not bad! The jasmine is a friendly one, it and the ylang ylang are pretty chill for Lorge Florals and I wouldn’t guess either of them without a cheat sheet. I can definitely smell the white chocolate particularly, and the grenadine a bit. Caramel, not really. I find this one to be wearable, but kind of muddled and not exciting. *Grenadine, heady Egyptian jasmine absolute, ylang ylang, white chocolate, caramel, ambergris* 3/5

**Party Under the Oak Trees** - This is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin! It’s a fresh peach, a bit of tea, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a dash of pink pepper. I don’t like peach very much, unfortunately. It does kind of mellow into a nonspecific sweetness, as it wears, though, and I felt it was oddly boring. Medium potent. *Pink pepper, fuzzy peach skin warmed in the sun, a hint of cinnamon, whipped cream, sweet tea, cedar, oakmoss, humid greenery.* 2.5/5

**UFO Disco** - This one isn’t actually a dislike, TBH. It’s more just a “damn, this is weird.” Which is on brand for an alien disco! It’s indeed mango-y, cardamom-y, and woody. They are rather jarring together, IMO- pass. I think it’s my general ambivalence about fruit notes that hold me back, too. *Mango lassi sprinkled with cardamom, guava, amyris wood and a holographic vanilla musk* 2.5/5

**Her Kind** -SHOCKING, the smoke note doesn’t overwhelm this scent! Finally! That being said, very similar to others in the catalog like Something Wicked, but much fainter- it’s not just the smoke that’s very light. I can smell it but just barely. *Musk, amber, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, myrrh co2, wisps of smoke* 2/5, would be higher if it lasted longer than 10 minutes and projected farther than one inch. 

**Your Girlfriend is a Badass** - I don’t really enjoy dirt notes much. This genuinely smells like a squashed chocolate cake on wet dirt, with a hint of pencil. Cool if you’re into soil notes, I bet. Not for me. Reasonably strong and long lasting. (Husband: “Dirt cake?”)*Yellow cake with a rich fudge frosting, Himalayan cedarwood, oakmoss, and forest floor.* 2.5/5


**Love and the Sea** - Ah, passionfruit, ambergris, and petitgrain. A trifecta of nope for me. The petitgrain is doing its dusty thing, the ambergris smells like salty whale, and the passionfruit is sour about it lol. (I had no business trying this one!) It is truly beachy, I will say that. It smells like sandy salty dusty driftwood overall. Like legitimately I smell wet sand. My husband sniffed it and said “Hmmm. Snail hole.” Hahahaha what the fuck, he is the worst and a freak of nature. *Passionfruit and raspberry lemonade, salty skin, sweetgrass, coconut water, neroli, driftwood, ambergris (vegan, synthetic), tropical musk, (Petitgrain sur fleurs, Ambrette, Timbersilk, Helvetolide)* 2/5 for the novelty of actually being a beachy smell sans coconut

**Dancing Under the Full Moon**- Wet on skin: huh, it isn’t as bad as I’d assumed from saffron and cumin! It reminds me of Tauer’s L’air du Desert Marocain… so I compared them side by side. (I wore the Tauer a decent bit years ago, but burned out on it- it’s just enormous and eternal). Sorce wins for me, by a long shot. It is like only the good parts of Marocain! Same hot desert spice market vibe, but far more user friendly. As it dries, it diverges more from the Tauer frag; the spices mellow out and it ends up super smooth and very pretty. (I think I’m enjoying the tuberose specifically, but I’m not sure?) At a fraction the power of the Tauer, it’s still very strong and long lasting. Guess what? I *absolutely love* it. (Husband: “wow, nice!”) *Tuberose absolute, labdanum, strawberry, saffron, Texan cedar, Amyris, ginger, cumin, cinnamon* 5/5

1jrnna5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1jrnna5/moving_with_roaches/,Moving with Roaches,"Hey everyone,

My girlfriend and I moved into a townhome last week and it turns out that it is infested with roaches. I believe they are German roaches from the research I’ve done and what I’m seeing. I’m seeing a few throughout the day but seeing the majority of roaches throughout the night (upwards of 25 per night of all different sizes). I work the midnight shift so my days off are spent looking for these critters in the kitchen and frankly anywhere else. I mostly find them in the kitchen, but have seen a few at other places around the house such as bathrooms, random walls and in the carpet in the living room (only seen 1 or 2 in this location). 

We are going to be breaking the lease and moving into a new place at the end of this month due to the heavy roach infestation we have been experiencing in our week here. I am terrified that we might accidentally bring some hitch hikers to our new place and infest that place by our stuff so I think I have come up with a plan, please let me know what you all think! 

1. Everything that can be wiped down with Lysol will be wiped down with Lysol wipes before being put in any type of box or bag to be moved. I am hoping to kill any baby roaches or even roach eggs that may be laid on any of these items by giving them a quick wipe down of Lysol.

2. Ziplock bags. Anything that can fit in them will be put in ziplock bags such as kitchen utensils and miscellaneous items. I am hoping that this would starve the roaches of water which I have read they can’t survive without for about a week if that’s correct. All food and spices that haven’t been opened or have some sort of seal to them (cap on spices, lid on bread crumbs container etc.) have been placed in ziplock bags, then placed in a plastic container and moved to my parents home. I’m hoping anything that is alive in there will die in the container in the 3 weeks it’ll be sitting in the container waiting to be moved. Any other food items that we weren’t confident in the seal or bags (think bagels, hotdog buns, English muffins in the bag etc.) were thrown away. 

3. I have read that roaches can die in the extreme cold. I am unsure what temperature “extreme cold” is, but I am hoping the freezer can reach whatever that temperature is. I am planning on putting items in ziplock bags then keeping them in the freezer for a few days to hopefully kill any live roaches or eggs that are hiding amongst the items inside the bags. Electronics will be getting the same treatment except thrown in trash bags then in the freezer with the trash bags being duct taped closed.

4. Furniture that can be wiped down with Lysol wipes such as end tables, chairs, dining room table, coffee table, smaller safes etc. will be wiped down clean with the wipes before being moved into the new place. Maybe bed frames and/or dressers and the small entertainment center as well. 

5. Clothes, towels, blankets, fabric bags etc. will be washed and dried then immediately placed into tied up and duct taped closed trash bags. These will then placed in vehicles awaiting to be moved into the new place (approximately 3 weeks). 

6. Everything that came in cardboard boxes will be removed from the original cardboard box (we hadn’t finished unpacking) and placed into clear plastic bins. The cardboard boxes will be recycled and will not be reused unless they were placed in rooms that we have seen no roach activity in (our bedrooms thank god). 

We have not had any roach issues prior to moving in to this townhome and it has been an absolute nightmare this past week. We would like to bring the fabric couch with us to our new home, but obviously don’t want to bring any of these things with us. Any suggestions on how to thoroughly make sure there are no eggs/roaches hiding in the couch would be much appreciated! 

I have seen some threads like these that have been answered thoroughly, but often times do not get any updates on if what they did worked or “lessons learned”. I will be moving in a few weeks and will provide periodic updates and “lessons learned” after the move in hopes that someone will find something in here helpful for the future. I appreciate any and all suggestions and/or feedback to my plan listed above and look forward to seeing what replies I may get! Thank you all in advance. ",2,1743803239.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

1jrnmcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jrnmcs/they_lied_to_you_about_what_happened_in_oak_river/,They Lied to You About What Happened in Oak River - Part 1,"As far as the United States government is concerned, I have been legally dead as of October, 2010. I am among the many killed in the ‘wild fire’ that spread across the town of Oak River, North Carolina. At least, that was what the official reports had claimed once the dust had settled. Due to a recent diagnosis, I feel like I don’t have a reason to keep what really happened to myself anymore. Despite all they’ve done to cover it up, as a final ‘fuck you’ to the powers that be, I’d like to tell those on this forum what really happened to my hometown that wiped it off the maps.

–  

Oak River was a small town in Western North Carolina, boasting an impressive population of 215. A hold over from a bygone era of America that was slowly losing its reason to exist as society itself modernized. Much like my dad before me, and his dad before him, I was inducted into the local police department. Well, ‘department’ is a generous word to describe what we had going on. It was more like what hall monitors are in elementary school. It’s a fancy badge that says you get to dictate the rules, if anyone really chooses to listen. But, much like with hall monitoring, there wasn’t anything worth enforcing. From what I can remember, nothing much strayed away from the usual drunk at the local bar, a domestic dispute (mostly from the Hendersons’ household), or a speeding ticket. Even then, there were barely enough people on the road for it to matter, and it was mostly a scolding toward the local high schoolers who had just been granted the right to drive their hand-me-down pickup truck that still operated via stick shift; the familial chariot. 

Down at the station, it was just the four of us. Sheriff Audrey Becker and her three bumbling deputies: me, Ben, and Lauren. I was freshly twenty-two, and had just recently stepped into the role following my dad’s passing the previous year from lung cancer. I felt unequipped to fill the shoes left behind, as every interaction I had was somehow followed by a callback to him and how much people liked him. He was a man who never knew the concept of a frown, and would fit a corny joke into any conversation, followed by a bellowing laugh and a clench of his beer belly. If he had grown his facial hair out past his mustache, I’d think he was a younger Santa Claus. 

“Junior!” exclaimed a man’s voice from behind me, followed by a hard grasp of his calloused palm on my left shoulder which shook my frame. I jolted in surprise, nearly spilling the freshly poured coffee from the styrofoam cup in my hands. 

I turned, groggily, to face Ben, one of the aforementioned deputies, who grinned with a wide, cheeky smile. He towered over me, his robust features recognizable even in the corner of my blurred vision. Ben chuckled to himself and ran his hand over his short, coarse hair, as he sat down at the tiny round table in the break room. 

I couldn’t help but crack a small smile despite his routine of bothering you just enough to get on your nerves, but not piss you off. It was an art form for him, boiled down to a social science. I could really best describe Ben as the older brother whose sole purpose on this Earth was to pick on you endearingly, because it’s not like anyone could do a thing to stop him. 

“Enjoying early shift? Or would you say late? Where does that fall on the clock for you?” He joked.

I turned, raising the coffee gently to my lips as I attempted to indulge in the sweet boost of caffeine while the boiling hot liquid threatened to scald my tongue. 

“Fuck this, man.” I mumbled. We both chuckled. “Passed twelve, it just dies. By that time, the bar is closed and every geezer is fast asleep anyways.”

Ben shrugged. “I can’t say I love it or hate it. But every so often, some wild shit gets called in. Did I ever tell you about that one time we caught some guy from the next town over who was breaking into Mrs. Brown’s house high as shit on PCP? We caught the fucker, buck ass naked, with his face in the dog food bowl in her kitchen-”

The sound of a landline ringing from the adjacent room down the hall cut Ben off from his story. He scrunched his face, craning his neck to look toward the door. I turned as well, a brow raised. Ben stood from his chair and huffed, making his way out of the break room and toward the source of the call. 

The next thing I knew, we were both on the road, speeding toward the source of the call. Sirens blaring as we rounded the sharp turns of the rural woodland roads. 

“Jesus,” I mumbled, my eyes nervously darting back and forth from the passenger side window to my clammy hands in my lap. “Should we call Ms. Becker?” 

Ben pursed his lips, gripping the steering wheel tighter. 

“Let’s–” he stopped to think over his wording “Let’s see how it is when we get there. See it first. Then we can call Sheriff.” 

“Aren’t the Buckleys gun freaks? Like, how–” I stammered

“Man, I don’t know. Dispatch wasn’t even clear on the full thing. I don’t think their daughter was coherent enough, I think that’s the problem.” The confidence in Ben’s voice wavered. 

It wasn’t long before the squad car pulled off the main road and rumbled up the gravel and dirt path, the sudden incline jolting the old vehicle. Aside from the light coming from our car, the Buckleys’ property was blanketed in a haze of thick darkness. The forest of pine trees made the drive feel claustrophobic, all packed together on the property, pushed tightly against the edge of the road. 

“Screw you for jinxing this.” Ben said, breaking the silence, doing his best to lift the heavy weight of anxiety with the toothpick of a joke. I shook my head, turning to reply, but was cut short. 

I nearly jumped from my skin in fright as the headlights suddenly illuminated the screaming and crying Jessica Buckley stumbling down the dirt road, nearly tripping and falling over as she waved her hands frantically over her head. 

“Jesus Christ!” Ben shouted, slamming on the breaks of the squad car as we came within a few meters of the terrified teenager, her face covered in tears, her eyes puffy.

Ben and I both exited the vehicle as fast as our limbs would respond to our brains. 

Jessica stumbled, finally caving to exhaustion as her hands moved to her face. 

“Help! Help, please!” Her words were choppy and drawn out as she mustered what she could through fainted breath and heavy emotions. This was our caller, I now understood why details were limited. Ben rushed forward, one hand on his service weapon out of sheer instinct. He looked around toward the treeline before kneeling down to the terrified girl and reaching out a hand for comfort. 

“Ma’am, what happened? Are you hurt?” He asked, trying his best to remain calm. Jessica lunged and held onto him with what little strength she had left, crying into his shoulder, heaving to catch her breath through the sobs. 

I stood, frozen, watching this unfold before me. I knew I was supposed to be prepared for this, it was my job. But this *never* happened out here. If only I had known the hell we would walk into up that hill on the Buckley property. Something I don’t think Oak River had ever experienced prior. 

Ben and I moved the nearly inconsolable Jessica into the squad car, her arms outstretched to the door as she clambered into the safety of the vehicle as fast as she could. She did all she could to catch her breath as we too made our way back inside. We both turned to look at her.

“Miss Buckley, can you tell us what happened?” Ben asked. Jessica stammered as she struggled to form any further words, crumbling into the back seat. 

“It’s okay, we’ve got you.” I added, desperately reaching for words of reassurance. She shook her head shakily, swatting the long strands of blonde hair that kept falling in front of her face. 

Ben turned to face me. “We gotta head up to the house–”

“No! No!” Jessica suddenly sat upright, pleading. We both looked back toward her, struck with confusion. 

“Don’t!” She heaved, catching her breath once more. “Don’t go back up there, please!”

“Miss, I know you’re scared. I know, but we’re here. We gotta go up there.” Ben placed his hand back on the steering wheel. 

“No!” She shrieked, starting to slam her palm on the divide between us and her. “You’ll die! We’ll die!” 

“God damnit.” Ben mumbled under his breath.

“Hey, it’s okay! Nothing is gonna happen to you. I know you’re scared.” I tried again to calm her, knowing how robotic I likely sounded. 

“Shut up! No!” Jessica broke down into a fountain of tears, her mouth agape as she wailed in terror. 

I looked toward Ben, he had turned to face the road, slowly accelerating the vehicle once again. 

“We can’t fuckin’ leave.” 

We both felt a wave of unease washing over us. The squad car made its way up the path, rumbling as it traversed over the unpaved road. 

Jessica continued to panic. The closer we got to the house, the more she grew desperate. Her slams on the divide mixed with pleas of unadulterated terror filled the vehicle. 

“Stop! Stop! Turn Around! Please! Please!” Her cries were drawn out, interrupted by the occasional hiccup caused by the excessive sobbing. “Let me out!” 

Jessica slammed her foot on the locked rear door with the distress of a cornered animal. Anything at this point to avoid reaching that house. I had no idea what to do or say, and I could tell that Ben was struggling to keep his composure. A moment later, the path came to an end. The front porch’s motion sensor light illuminated the area as the car crept to a halt. 

Ben and I did our best to assess the scene at face value from the safety of our vehicle, looking toward the areas that were basked in the headlights or porch light. The front door of the house hung by a single hinge, battered, revealing the black void of the house’s interior. Then, both Ben and I saw it. A sign of things to come.

A wooden dog house sat by the door. Connected to it was the metal chain usually used to hold the collar of a large dog to the dog house itself. As my eyes followed the snaking chain along the grass, they landed at a large, unmoving lump. I couldn’t get a detailed look due to the lighting, but my stomach was sinking further the more I scanned the area. 

“What the fuck?” Ben squinted, reaching for the door handle. “Junior, gun.” 

I nodded. As we both went to exit the vehicle, Jessica shot upwards, unleashing another shriek. 

“No! No! It’s still here! Don’t leave me here! Please!” She sobbed, pounding the back of our seats with her palm.

Ben turned back, one leg already out of the car by this point. 

“It’s okay, you’re safe. Not gonna let anything happen, okay sweetheart?” Ben’s voice was as reassuring as he could make it, but I could hear the cracks. He turned to me, a stern look now plastering his face. 

“Get on the radio, we need backup. Gonna need EMTs here too.” He ordered. 

I was too hung up on Jessica's words. I knew they were the ramblings of someone utterly distraught, but ‘it’? My mind clung to the word, it stood out like a sore thumb. I tried to run through reasons as to why she would–

“Jackson!” Ben hissed, patting me roughly on my shoulder, snapping me from my trance. 

I nodded, fumbling for the radio. Before I pressed the button to talk, I reached out to Ben. 

“Hey, wait.” I said, keeping my eyes fixed dead ahead on the house. Ben stopped, his hand back on his holstered service weapon. 

“What?”

“We can’t both go in there and leave her in the car. Not when we don’t know who’s here.”

“Yeah, well I’m not going in alone for the same fucking reason.” Ben muttered. 

“We announce ourselves first. Say we’re armed.” 

“Brother, I’m not gonna waste time if people in there need first aid. We’re going now.” Ben took a further step out of the car.

Jessica whimpered from the back seat, tears still streaming down her cheeks. 

“No! There’s–” She took a quick inhale, fighting off her tears. “We gotta go! They’re dead! It’ll come back!” her glassy eyes darted back and forth from me to Ben, pleading with us for the hundredth time. 

Ben leaned back into the car. “*What* happened? Gotta tell me. Gotta tell us.”

“I– I came home and they were–” Jessica’s eyes darted past us and out the front windshield, followed by a shriek that made both Ben and I jump. She recoiled back into the seat and her eyes bulged from their sockets. 

Ben and I spun around to face the house once again, seeing a figure dart back through the threshold of the front door. By the time we had seen it, most of it was already inside. I didn’t know if Ben realized the same thing, but whoever, or *whatever* it was, was *big*. 

“Fuck!” shouted Ben, drawing his weapon and aiming it toward the house. He smacked the side of the car to get my attention. “Call in!” 

I nodded shakily and grasped the radio in my sweaty palm, speaking into the microphone with as stoic of a tone that I could muster. We needed the Sheriff at the very least. I prayed that backup would be on its way soon.

“Oak River Police Department! Come out with your hands where I can see them!” Ben bellowed, keeping his firearm’s aim on the front door. All remained quiet except for the chirp of the midnight insects and the cruiser’s engine. 

As I finished my call to dispatch, I carefully and hesitantly opened my passenger side door. I too reached for my service weapon, but couldn’t bring myself to draw it from the confines of its holster just yet. A debilitating weight of fear clung to me, holding me from moving my arm. 

“Don’t go in there!” Jessica pleaded from inside the car. I knew that by this point. My blood had run cold and nothing could persuade me to enter that house. Triple homicide in this town? If I were to believe Jessica, which I was very much inclined to, her parents and brother were long dead inside that house. Why the hell did she continue to say ‘it’? Delirium? I wanted to believe so. 

“Come out! Show me your hands! We’re armed!” Ben announced once again, maintaining his stance from behind his open door. We all sat by that car for what felt like an eternity. I could only imagine the shit we would get for not going inside and not securing the situation, but more and more I felt like if we did head inside, we would end up just like the Buckleys. 

Ben grunted in frustration, moving out from behind the relative safety of the driver’s side door and hesitantly beginning to approach the house. His boots crunching along the patchy grass loudly despite his best efforts. 

As he was only a few steps in, a loud slam erupted from the back of the house, echoing through the night, causing Ben to stop where he stood as it caught him off guard. The scratch of old hinges signaled that the back door had been thrown open, followed by the rustling of someone rushing out into the woods. Dried foliage crackled under the quickly paced footsteps as the home’s invader seemingly fled into the foliage out through the back of the Buckley home. 

Ben recomposed himself and motioned to me with one hand. “Let’s go!” 

I shook myself from my trance of fear, drawing my firearm at long last and stepping out of the vehicle’s safe embrace. I needed to do my job, I needed to get my bearings straight despite all the instinctual alarms going off in my brain. Part of me wanted to stall for every second I could to wait for backup. As I advanced, I stumbled at first, but eventually adopted a more confident footing as I made my way across the yard to join Ben, who took the lead. 

Our first pit stop right before entering the house of horrors brought us within clear view of our first sight of carnage. 

The Buckleys owned an English Mastiff, a dog that had scared the hell out of me on multiple occasions when I had been at the home before for far less distressing reasons. The beast of a pet weighed probably as much as I did. It was the ultimate deterrent from stepping foot on their property aside from the arsenal of firearms that everyone knew Mr. Buckley kept inside the walls of his abode. Hence why my heart sank as we approached ‘Greg’, or what was left. 

My legs locked in place as I staggered to a halt a few feet from the viscera, small trails of steam still rising from the shredded lump of canine flesh in the cold autumn air. I stared, blankly, unaware of how to process what I saw. The animal had been parted in two, unceremoniously; torn unevenly. Innards poured out onto the grass. Ben’s shaky breath beside me indicated that we both came to grasp a fraction of what lay ahead. 

“Oh– Oh shit– I…” Ben couldn’t find the words. I was amazed he even attempted. We both wrestled to shift our gaze toward the front door, heartbeats racing at their capacity. 

As though my prayers had been answered, the distant sound of a squad car’s siren called out through the night down the dirt road. The lights punctured through the dense trees in small pinpoints. Sheriff Becker had arrived.

In school, I remember reading this Sci-Fi book called *Unwind.* It was about the aftermath of a war fought over reproductive rights. A compromise was reached, where parents could sign their children off to be “unwound” at age 13, i.e. have their body parts harvested for future use. There was a quote that resonated with me at the very beginning of the book. “I was never going to amount to much anyway, but now, statistically speaking, there’s a better chance that some part of me will go on to greatness somewhere in the world. **I’d rather be partly great then entirely useless.**” That last part always got to me.

I was born 3 months prematurely, which led to a mild physical disability in one of my arms. It’s noticeably shorter than the other and much of the muscle mass that was in it had to be scraped away like fat trimmings. While it wasn’t unusable, I still couldn’t do some tasks like a normal child would. When I first learned to write, I did it on a slanted board almost like an easel. I couldn’t support my own weight if I hung from playground equipment, and there were some gym class activities that I had to sit out of.

Oddly enough, it wasn’t the physical stuff that affected me the most. It was the mental side of things most of the time. I always had an inkling that something was wrong with me since I was little. I either made too much eye contact, or too little, I often found myself daydreaming too often, and I was too sensitive. I remember my Kindergarten teacher being my first real school bully. I was belittled for every mistake, micromanaged, singled out, and screamed at to the point of tears.

 I always felt different, and I think others perceived me that way too. It was always, “that kid’s too quiet; he’s weird; he’s a complete idiot.” For a while, I believed them. I never really got the best grades, the teacher could’ve been writing math on the board in Mandarin, and it still wouldn’t have made a difference. My grades stunk until midway through my sophomore year of high school. I excelled in my English classes, and I had a math tutor that explained thing in a way I could understand. My GPA shot up from a 2.7 to a 4.0 my junior year. Many people were happy with me and supportive, but there were always the others that acted like “why does this conceited prick think he’s so smart all of a sudden?”

I went on to college and graduated with a 3.9 overall. I even had a job lined up in my field of study (Comm. and Journalism, that’s totally useful, right?). Finally, it felt like I proved all those classmates and teachers wrong. I *was* smart enough, and I *could* do it.

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left to take it. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. I was expected that I’d just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. They were the only job that said yes to me after months of applying and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m officially stuck. I’m hesitant to go back to school and just shell out more cash for a degree that’s going to leave me high and dry again. I could quit my job, but I’d probably end up in some call center or back in CS. That to me, sounds like trading a rough road for a rougher one. I can’t go into the military, because if my arm doesn’t keep me out, the anti-depressants that I’m taking sure would.

If I could give my life to someone who truly wanted to hold onto theirs, I’d do it. A kid, a mom, somebody who’s worth something gets to stay, and a classic fuck-up gets to leave. It’s an even trade. When all the small victories have led to a dead end and the pattern is likely to continue, it doesn’t seem worth it. It’s like a bowling pin getting knocked down and reset. If someone out there still had a bit of fight left in them, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to have this time instead?

What he says:

1) He really believes the trade deficit narrative and feels like we’re being screwed over & expects countries to negotiate down our current… tariffs? Which is connected to trade deficit by something?

2) He believes we can become a manufacturing power house (including sourcing non-native products like bananas and coffee)

3) create a new source of revenue for the government so he can cut taxes (built on trickledown economic principles)

Things others say

4) tank the market and the dollar so we can reset the economy by making it easier to sell off our debt cheap

5) Create an opportunity for the wealthy to purchase more power/future wealth for less

6) He dumb

7) edit: another one I heard today.  The market was ready for a correction so he’s ripping the bandaid off now so he has time to build a positive market story by midterms (I think this give him too much credit)

I purchased 3 EDP samples, 2ml each. After this I’ve tried every EDP in their collection so far. Shipping was $4 and total processing and shipping time was 3 days.

**My Preferences**

YES: aquatic, aromatic, lactonic, patchouli, tropical, vanilla, woods

MAYBE: booze, citrus, fresh, fruit, green, musk, nuts, resins, spices, sweet

NO: floral, food, powder

**Ranking System**

1/5 = bad, probably a scrubber  
2/5 = not good, not to my tastes  
3/5 = good, just not “for me”  
4/5 = great, but missing something  
5/5 = perfect, give it to me

**Blackberry Heartwood**  
🫐🌱☀️

Fruity and green with notes of blackberry, greens, sandalwood, and amyris. Moderate scent throw. Lasted 2-3 hours on moisturized skin.

Starts off with a ripe, acidic, unsweetened blackberry wrapped in a blanket of fresh greens. The overall effect is sharp, outdoorsy, and wet-smelling, like fresh soil and dew-covered leaves. The blackberry note settles and becomes less sharp as the scent dries down, and I get a bit of sweetness and warmth from the amyris, the sun rising and the morning dew evaporating. The sandalwood note is not particularly strong and serves more to ground the fragrance. These are wild blackberries growing in a forest, not in someone’s garden.

4/5 stars. Wearing this makes me feel like a black bear foraging for berries in the forest, and I just know there’s someone out there who wants to smell exactly like that.

**My Curse**  
🍷🧣🐇

Fruity and musky with notes of red wine, hyssop, cashmere, suede, and musk. Intimate scent throw. Lasted 3-4 hours on moisturized skin.

Oh yeah, that’s definitely red wine. This isn’t overly boozy, but it definitely has that fruity vinegary red wine smell. The cashmere, suede, and musk are like a warm, fuzzy, expensive fur pelt surrounding and cushioning the red wine note. There’s also a licorice-y note that I believe is from the hyssop. If I were to attach a visual to this it would be a wealthy middle-aged woman bundled up in a fur coat over her athleisure outfit, drinking red wine at a luxury ski resort – or even better, her family’s vacation home in the mountains – on a winter day.

2/5 stars. I wanted to find out whether I enjoy a prominent red wine note. I don’t love it. I prefer my fruity fragrances with a certain amount of sweetness that isn't present here.

**We Played Our Records Backwards Too Many Times**  
☕️🌲👟

Bitter and earthy with notes of black cherry, coffee, orchid, and vetiver. Moderate scent throw. Lasted 3-4 hours on moisturized skin.

A blast of bitter dark roast coffee right off the bat, followed shortly by a dark, bitter cherry. The vetiver in this is similar to in Neon Noir, very rich and earthy. Something in here is manifesting on my skin as a sort of sweaty smell, but not fresh sweat. Sweaty gym clothes that have been sitting in someone’s gym bag all day after they worked out in the morning. But it’s the sweat of someone you’re attracted to, so it stinks but it’s a compelling stink. Put together, this scent is dirt, a coffee shop, and the sweat of a hot barista after a long shift.

2/5 stars. You’d expect sweat smell to earn only one star but I actually don’t hate it that much. I would never wear this, but it isn’t as awful as one star would imply.

**Final Verdict**

Now that I’ve tried all of Stone & Wit’s EDPs, I plan to sit back and wait to see if any of their oil-exclusive scents get EDP versions in the future. There are several I’d like to try, but I strongly prefer EDPs over oils.

Though I’ve had a relatively low success rate with this house – the lowest of any indie house I’ve tried, actually – I’m not ready to write them off entirely. Call me a reckless optimist, but I have only tried 9 total scents from this house, so I’m holding out hope.",4,1743802743.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

As you’re most probably used to by now, this is just my initial warning that what follows is my ranting and rambling about both Steam Deck-specific(ish) news, and general gaming news I’ve spotted and seems interesting to me.

I do my very little best to try make this feel a *little* like old gaming sites or old blogs. Old forum posts (none of the above I was alive to even witness, but I’ve archeologized – totally a word – enough of these from back in the days of old to know those are what *I love the most*, so…I try!

# Two bits of GOG News / Games / Facts / Fun

# Konami Code

Here’s one I’m sure you already know, since its hardly a secret. Aside from being a platform where you can tens of thousands of games, GOG also hid an activation via the Konami Code in their website

From your games library, ***enter up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A*** and you’ll have two games appear within the secret screen in your browser to play there: Snake, or Pong!

# Sierra On-Line

Back in 2022 GOG shared a wonderful blog post about the history of Sierra On-Line games. It covers a lot with links branching off – highlighting some games and some history in there:

*It all started in 1979 with a text-based adventure game called Colossal Cave that Ken Williams brought to his home in Simi Valley, California. The game captivated his wife, Roberta, and inspired her to create an adventure game of her own. The title had a plot and art style inspired by Agatha Christie’s novels. Called Mystery House, the Williams family created the entire game from scratch. Thankfully it was a hit (with 15,000 copies sold) and it prodded them to get into the video game business full-time.*

The latest update has arrived for Heart of Chernobyl. Patch 1.3 is here. It’s *quite* extensive this time around, so I won’t list them here (it’d take too much space!) but rather link you to the Steam page detailing them.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 not only suffers from me having to type the letters in with a full-stop between each letter, *but* it also launched in a fairly broken state. We all know who to blame this time, rather than the (sadly common now) tradition of releasing a game broken because they *can*, this time it was a real life warzone which affected their ability to make a game.

[Hopefully this patch gets it to a space nice enough to enjoy the game even more than it has been (though…I have to admit, it’s too damn scary for me!) - the link to the post is here](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/831582351143207687?)

# Hope Town

This is one of two games I’ve spotted on Kickstarter which might be interesting to some. The names and faces *behind* the game are interesting but the fact they’re stating this is a \[spiritual?\] successor to the ever-fascinating Disco Elysium (former Dying Light and Witcher 3 devs) is a bit sad. It looks to be true, but it makes me feel so frustrated when games have to promote themselves based on the success of *other* games, especially when they’re unique. Which this sure looks to be.

[The Kickstarter link and page is here, which explains all, but I’ll include a few pictures because the art is wonderful:](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown?category_id=35)

I’m a big fan of Lovecraftian horror. Not so much the ‘getting scared’ side of it (I’m a wimp with scary games), but the setting, the atmosphere. The era in time.

The Sinking City (the first game) had a LOT of drama, but since their long battle with Nacon, the developers (called Frogwares) won, and are the sole publisher of the game. And you *should* [Follow this link and read about their battles on a PC Gamer page, it’s a pretty fascinating story about the woes they were subjected to:](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-sinking-city-legal-battle-ends-with-victory-for-frogwares-new-version-of-the-game-coming-soon/)

Anyway, tangent aside, their sequel to that game is on its way, and being funded this time, in part, by Kickstater.

From their Kickstarter page:

*The Sinking City 2 is a third-person survival horror game, set in an otherworldly Lovecraftian version of the 1920s United States. Coming to PC (Steam, EGS, GOG), PS5 and Xbox Series*

*Experience a heart-pounding survival horror as you navigate the flooded streets of Arkham. Fight terrifying Eldritch abominations, face monumental beings beyond human comprehension known as The Great Old Ones, and investigate the dark mysteries gripping this forsaken place*

This one’s something I’m *sure* everyone here has spotted. Having only just played through Half-Life 2 for the first time a few months back, even I was aware of any tiny bit of news or announcements on the series of games. This time it’s no different, I’d expect.

Anyway, from the Steam page:

*Re-live the groundbreaking, critically acclaimed Half-Life 2 like never before, reimagined with RTX Remix. Featuring full ray tracing, remastered assets, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, this DLC is free for Half-Life 2 owners*

# Epic sale

This one’s for the 5 people here who care about Epic Games’ sales and have a library of purchased games (*not* just those we’ve claimed weekly for years!).

The sale starts on March 26th, but I also weirdly see in a search that there’s another on April 10th for some reason? IDK why. These sales used to be quite significant as they had their coupons involved, but having long-since killed those, well…I guess we’ll see what is worth buying when it happens!

# Switch cat

This one’s just…me spotting something I think is adorable, and thus subjecting you to it. This is ‘Switch Cat fanart’ by an artist whose username is shunixe, but also seems to be Xezeno Xezeno1 (which only reminds me of Xenomorphs and how much terror I subjected myself to when I played Alien: Isolation with the lights turned off, headphones on, and all alone. It was a mistake I made exactly *once*)

Anyway, *THIS IS ADORABLE, LOOK AT IT!!!*

Metro has now turned 15 years old. And they’re having a 15th anniversary update (4A games)

The following text obviously comes from their page, but I encourage you to click the link at the end of me rambling to watch that video, running 3:56 seconds, which celebrates all their years.

\*Hello everyone,

We shared with you earlier this month that we wanted to tell you more about the status of our team and our future, so what better opportunity to do so as celebration of Metro’s 15th anniversary.   In honor of the incredible 15 years of Metro, we’ve created a video to celebrate our journey throughout the tunnels of the metro, made possible by our devoted community that have supported us along the way.

# Halt and Catch Fire

HCF, or “Halt and Catch Fire,” was a term referring to a machine code instruction that caused a processor to stop normal operation and enter an unrecoverable state.

It came from early-early computing and is ended up being use to just…describe catastrophic system failures. It’s not a practical command, it just symbolized a dramatic crash or malfunction in computing systems.

Halt and Catch Fire is *also* one of my favorite TV shows ever made. A drama series set in the 1980s and 1990s, following a group of ‘visionaries’ in the tech industry during the rise of the personal computer and internet eras.

Well, [follow this link to a Polygon article which details why HaCF has the best depictions of gaming in it (and it does, dear reader, it does!): it’s not about the game; it’s about what the game gets you to](https://www.polygon.com/24168298/halt-catch-fire-video-games-anniversary-best-show)

* Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising
* Toybox Turbos
* Rise of the Argonauts
* Maelstrom: The Battle for Earth Begins
* Damnation
* Hospital Tycoon It’s a strange move, especially considering these are old, old titles now, but still a sad one to see them unavailable (legally)

**And one more**:

this time some nice, nostalgic 2000’s era ad mockups done by a talented design artist - RetroB0y, showing a glimpse of what it’d look like if the Steam Deck was released in the early 2000s. These remind me so strongly of the Sony PlayStation ads made and run in the early 2000s for the PS2 in magazines and other print media. No matter what, these are a treat!

# This week’s free games:

As ever, Epic gives a free game away, and (I know, the term ‘free’ here isn’t as free as it is with Epic’s) there is some from Prime Gaming. These are available if you subscribe to Amazon Prime, and are yours to keep forever, even if you no longer subscribe to the service.

**Epic:**

Jurassic World Evolution from 2021 is free this week. This *seems* a nice ‘get’, considering it is recent and is semi-well regarded, but one thing to remember is that you’re *only* getting the base game with this. The DLC mounts up immediately, and costs like $80,000 (slight exaggeration) to have everything.

If you are in Belarus, Russia then you’ll be unable to claim this game this week.

**From Prime Gaming:**

As always, Prime gives a few games each week, and to me is the *best* deal in gaming. I’ve been subscribed to Game Pass for a looooong time now, but this somehow feels like my fav option. Maybe because it lets me build up my beloved GOG library. Anyway, this weeks games are:

* March 20: Wolfenstein: The Old Blood \[Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code\]
* March 20: Mutazione \[GOG Code\]
* March 20: Figment 2: Creed Valley \[Amazon Games App\]
* March 20: Legacy of Kain: Defiance \[GOG Code\]
* March 20: Mortal Shell \[Epic Games Store\]

# Apple’s long-lost hidden recovery partition:

I *know*, this isn’t even vaguely gaming-oriented. But it’s super interesting, and I feel like there’s a nice intersection of gamers + tech-minded folk in here who might want to follow the link. Just a quick copy of the user’s post, then I’ll link you to what they’re talking about:

*You might remember when I asked about looking for an unformatted Performa 550 a couple of months ago because I was looking for a lost recovery partition that Apple had a couple of technotes about. I wanted to share an update – I was able to find what I was looking for thanks to a kind person here on this subreddit! It’s nifty functionality I had never seen before that tries to save you if something gets messed up with your System Folder. I’m surprised Apple didn’t continue forward with this on later models. If you want to try it for yourself, I uploaded a “factory fresh” hard drive image with this partition for preservation purposes. It works on lots of models, not just the 550. There is still an unanswered question about how the partition was originally created, so if anyone else has a Performa 550 that hasn’t been formatted, I’d especially be interested in finding out if it has this partition, or even just if Apple Backup is a custom version/size that doesn’t match any of the screenshots from my blog. It might also be interesting to find out if the Performa 575 had it too*

# Xbox was released in 2002:

This is a little late, but 4 days back, it was *that* day on which the original Xbox was released in Europe and Australia. 3 years of Xbox being on the scene (in those regions, at least!), which is incredible to see. While their news might be a little thin-icey lately…

[I’d love to remind you that, 2002, Microsoft released a commercial for the original Xbox that was banned after the UK’s Independent Television Commission received 136 complaints - called ‘Life is Short’ (click this link to see it!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELPRVu0GxYo)

# Super Famicom

This just…was interesting for me to see. I have a soft spot in my heart for gaming hardware I wasn’t even *close* to being alive for on release, especially when it combines with gray/beige coloring.

And, I’ll drop another reminder in here! My friend Gardiner Bryant set up a Revolt server for Steam Deck, Linux and general gamers. It’s built up a lot now, with 82 users in the sub. Plenty of them are devs and creators of some of the programs and applications you use on your Steam Deck (or Linux PC!), and…I’m hoping it’s a nice place for people to visit and chat.

[Revolt itself is a FOSS alternative to Discord! You can read more about it via their site, which is linked in this sentence](https://revolt.chat/)

The link to the Revolt server is here, if you want to join in, have a look, or chat games! I also wrote a post about it some time ago here on Lemmy, if you want to read a *little* more detail: [The link to which is here!](https://lemmy.world/post/26588497)

# What have you been playing?!

IDK, thought it might be nice if you wanted to share what *you* have been enjoying when it comes to video games! What game have you been playing? Enjoying? *Not* enjoying? Leave a comment, if you’re so inclined, I’d love to hear more about what the community here has been enjoying, please share it!

I’ve been enjoying a Nintendo Switch actually. I used to be obsessed with them had a lil collection, but I sold them all when I got my Steam Deck.

I recently bought a V2 Switch super cheap in Japan, and I’ve since installed a picofly mod-chip in it, so I can run CFW on there (*themes on my Switch! How can you beat that?!*)

I’ve been playing Metroid Prime: Remake on it, being one of my fav games. And on my Steam Deck I’ve started to enjoy Half-Life 2 again, and it runs oh-so-beautifully!

# And that’s it?

I think this might be the end of what I can ramble on about.

As always, any errors are my own, as with formatting. I do so hope you’ve found something interesting in here, by now maybe you’re aware I am oh-so-very tired of traditional gaming news outlets. They’re running with baked in advertisements, written by A.I. or generally such low-effort swill they’re ripping off a comment they spotted. I just want to at least *try* bring back the feeling of the old-old gaming blogs, where Patreon and support and donations and ads weren’t the focus of what you’re on a site to see!

I chain vape, drink lots of coffee and also use kratom. Do they make a big deal out of coffee and nicotine to the point it will skyrocket my quote? Tbh I don’t really care to get life insurance since I have no children but I am only 24 so now is the time to supposedly get covered.

My biggest fear with this is that I will be red flagged for opiate use (kratom is a very very mild opiate) and it will raise a false alarm for harder things like fentanyl that I don’t use. I havent been to the doctor since i was 19 and only time I had bloodwork was when I donated plasma when i was 20. I have also taken physicals for work and such but thats it.

So what should I do? Should I rush to quit all of this stuff at once potentially risking withdrawl symptoms (runny nose, restlessness, high bp, fever, headache, sweating, vomitting etc) and risk getting even worse lab results or should i just take the bloodwork and hope for the best? I am not obese, dont have high bp (i take my own vitals) I do have some dental issues that aren’t very noticable unless you look very closely but I still have all my teeth for now.

1jrn3fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jrn3fv/i_dont_want_to_feel_grateful_for_this/,I don't want to feel grateful for this,"Today would've been our 11th anniversary. We stopped celebrating anniversaries 5 years ago, but today I woke up and couldn't figure out why I felt so numb and sad until I saw the date. Someone said that I should just focus on being grateful that I'm away from him, and I am grateful to be free but at the same time it hurts so much. I think the best word I can come up with to describe this weird feeling is disappointed. I'm just extremely disappointed that he hurt me for almost 11 years, that he would rather have harmed me than ever treat me with dignity and respect. I am disappointed that this is how it ended, and that today just kind of feels the same as all of the other uncelebrated anniversaries over the years.

He gets to keep his job, he gets to keep punishing my good friend who works with him. He gets to spend even more money on himself, because he's living with someone for free who supports his version of events. He's going to move into a whole house, on his own, and I think that just really hammers home the abuse I was experiencing. He was always taking my money, over-spending, getting into debt and telling me how much ""financial trouble"" he was in. And I caught him in January, saw his finances and his bank account, and that's when he finally lost control and started to unravel the relationship. Thousands of dollars spent solely on himself every month, for years, while I have been reliant on food stamps and government assistance that he would regularly take advantage of. He made 5 times as much as I did, yet still had me pay for most of our outings, nearly all of our groceries, small things in stores so he would stop throwing public tantrums, etc etc. He told us we were so broke that I couldn't quit my job, but when my job became too demanding or I made too many friends, he would tell me at any sign of complaint or difficult workday to just quit. That he'd take care of me, I didn't need to work. Which was not true, at all, and I know this but it still hurts so much to see that he never truly needed to do this to me in the first place. There was never any real reason to treat me like trash, to hit me or throw me or kick me or leave every dirty dish piled in the sink. There was never a reason to keep peeing on the floor and leaving it until I cleaned it up. There was never a reason to take my food stamps or the cash out of my wallet, never a reason to shove me to the floor, never a reason to scream at me until I was sobbing so hard I couldn't breathe. I want there to be a reason, I really do, because then at least some of this would make sense. But it still just doesn't compute and I spend so much time asking myself why he would do this to me.

I think there's just also some jealousy, that even though I filed a PO and he lost most of his friends, he still has the means to try and make himself more attractive to new people to manipulate and sees no reason to stop mistreating the ones who felt like what he did to me was wrong. There's no true accountability, and it just feels like I'm being poisoned by knowing what's going on in his life, what he's done to other people, and how much he has manipulated this situation into him seeming like a victim finally getting back on his feet. Which is what I'M doing, not him. It feels like my story is being stolen and I get really angry and jealous and self-hating when people believe him over me.

I hate being told to be grateful that I'm away from him because I'm not grateful, or happy, or any sort of positive emotion. For me it feels like I was given two really bad options: escape or die. And I got away, and I know that's the best possible outcome, but it doesn't really feel like anything at all. I spend a lot of time just thinking ""oh, this is what living feels like"" because I had no concept of living MY life. Everything I did had to align with him. This is just what people do all day, they wake up and drink coffee and get a snack and work and pet their dogs and hug their friends. I didn't get to do these things, and while I'm glad to have them now I also don't want to be grateful that I finally get the things I should have had in the first place.

I know I have PTSD from what he did to me. I was diagnosed with PTSD a while ago based on some different traumatic experiences, but I feel the triggers and the anxiety ramping up all over again and I have no control over it. I am terrified to walk down the street. I've changed the outfits I'm wearing, just in case he recognizes me, and I'm too scared to wear my favorite jacket or jeans. I won't put my hair down, and I've been taking a hiking trail instead of using the sidewalk on our street because I know he lives close and I'm terrified he'll drive by me. I won't sit near the window on the bus, and I am too scared to go to any events in town because we have similar interests and there's a chance he'll be there, even though I did get the PO and I know he legally would have to leave. I can't go to any bars or anywhere with alcohol, because he's an alcoholic and spends most of his evenings in bars. I'm just wandering in circles in my living room feeling like a caged animal with so much anxiety and rage and just extreme defeat. I know that in the end, I did the right thing for myself and my best friend and we got out and things are hundreds of times better without him torturing us. But now I'm dealing with the terror of having someone who wants to kill me be angry at me for speaking out, the anxiety of being recognized by him or any of his friends, and the constant weight of knowing that there was never a reason to hurt me.

On the outskirts of a town in the southeastern part of the states, was a lone ranch home. Trees were the only neighbors as there were no other houses for a couple of miles. But the person who owned it, preferred it that way.

Lori was a businesswoman. And after all the weekly hustling and constant communication, she was always relieved to have her own little getaway every day. The little one-story dwelling was spacious enough. It had electricity and plumbing and the basic quarters: a bedroom, parlor, bathroom, kitchen, and dining room. Plus, the woodsy atmosphere was both refreshing and relaxing. Living amongst nature was good for the soul, Lori had always heard. And she didn't mind the occasional curious critter that would saunter by her home for a quick hello and goodbye.

Except when it came to spiders. Those scuttling poison pouches were an absolute no in Lori's household.

One foggy, Friday evening, Lori drove her car up to her narrow driveway. She had worked very late this day and could not wait to put her feet up all weekend. But as the woman pulled in closer, she stepped onto the brake. She blinked through the mist and spotted some kind of animal, pacing by her front door. But even with the auto headlights, she could barely make the dang thing out. But whatever it was, it was dark as night, had a long, dense tail, and was much bigger than the average squirrel.

And it definitely wanted to get inside...

Feeling oddly chilled, even though the weather was considerably warm, Lori slammed the bottom of her palm on the wheel, blaring her vehicle's horn which made the thing jolt and bound away. Lori stayed put momentarily, looking all around herself. With all of the haze, she didn't see where the thing went but by how fast it had moved, she surmised that it'd retreated well off into the woods.

Lori moved her car forward to park and a sonorous shrill abruptly rang out in the vaporous air. She jerked in her seat and got out. The woman did not see anything amiss until she looked down. Next to one of the back wheels was a black tail with a ruddy oozing cut at one end. The strange animal must've gotten confused by the loud horn and had hidden underneath the car.

The severed appendage was convulsing like a decapitated snake. Unblinking at the gruesome sight, Lori clamped onto her abdomen from sudden disgust and the pang of remorse. She only wanted to scare the thing off. She didn't mean to hurt it!

Lori rushed around her property, scanning for any animal that appeared to be in pain or distress. It was getting late and with no signs of anything, the woman walked back to her automobile and stared at the dark-furred, maimed, stilled tail. It was thick and elongated, and she swore the strange animal was not that overly large.

With a sullen shrug and not wanting to attract any nightly predators nor scary scavengers, Lori took out a large rag out of her car's glove compartment and began the grisly task of wrapping the tail for proper disposal.

As Lori stood up and turned off the car's engine, that hair-prickling chill remade its presence as she felt both alone and not alone, all at once.

Shivering, the woman kicked the vehicle's door shut with her shoe. And with a hitched breath, she hurried to her home, unlocked the steel door, and didn't reopen her eyelids until the entrance was closed and relocked from the inside.

***

After a lounging dinner and some late-night television on the couch, Lori put on her nightclothes and then settled into her cozy bed; fully contented to finally get to sleep in. But as her mind began to drift, her awareness was snapped awake from a constant, low scratching at the base of her front door.

Lori flung off the blanket and left the bedroom to peer out the parlor's locked windowpanes. The porch lantern was on. However, she still couldn't see any critters. Not even a moth trying in vain to flutter through the lantern's glass.

Reluctantly, the woman started heading for her bed. However, the scratching had resumed. And the sounds were becoming more dragging and more... persistent.

""Who's out there?!"" Lori shouted, thinking it was some dang campers loitering and playing pranks. ""This isn't funny! Stop it now, or I'll call the cops-!""

This was when Lori's eyes went wide with realization. She couldn't use her phone because she had left it at work and was going to retrieve it later on! She was so upset over the car incident with the strange animal that she was only remembering this again just now. Never had Lori regretted so much about not getting a landline installed in her house!

The scratching continued. Longer and louder.

I'm calling the cops right now!"" lied the woman. ""So, you better leave-!""

""Tailypo... Tailypo... All I want is my tailypo...""

Lori stood frozen as if her body had become a vast sheet of ice. The voice didn't sound like any teenager she'd ever encountered. It was echoic, like multiple voices that were not from any man nor woman. Much less from any human.

That odd chill recommenced from Lori's fluttering heart, down to her sock-covered curled toes.

""Tailypo... tailypo..,"" it repeated. ""I want my tailypo...""

Lori swallowed and finally regained her voice.

""I don't have or know of any 'tailypo'! So, whoever you are, you better go-!""

Long, piercing claws emerged from beneath the door, scraping it. Again. And again. And again...

""Tailypo..! Tailypo..! I want my tailypo!""

The dark demand dripped with ire. 

Confused and frightened to the core, the woman clutched one of her collector's hound plates off a wall shelf and with a yelp, threw the porcelain at the bottom of the door. After the shatter, she waited with bated breath.

The deep scratching and bizarre voice fell silent.

Too scared to sleep, Lori got the idea of driving into town. Not bothering to put on shoes, she lurched in the parlor, swiped the keys off a coffee table, and darted around the broken bits of plate and for her car. However, when she prepared to get in, the automobile interior lights had shown her that there was a problem...

One of the back wheels was gone. The rubber had been slashed down to nothing but gnawed metal. And with the sight of glinting bits of glass shards on the driver's seat, it appeared that the side window had the same fate, as well.

Swallowing, the agitated woman veered her head to and fro. For she detected a raspy rumble within the evening wind...

With a sweaty brow and swelling lungs, Lori closed the car door. She didn't want to sit in an immobile vehicle like a fish in a barrel nor run in the woods in the pitch of night where the dark thing was in its elements. And with no other options, she shut off her car and retreated into the small house to hold up until morning.   

Plopping the keys to the floor, Lori slowly sat on a loveseat in the parlor. Eyes barely blinking, she kept them glued to the clawed-up front door while second thoughts of living closer to civilization bemoaned her hindsight.

Two hours went by and when the adrenaline began to ebb away, eventually, so did the tired woman's consciousness.

""Tailypo... Tailypo... give me back my tailypo...""

With a jerk, Lori fumbled from the sofa and gawked at the metallic backdoor. The lengthy, spiky talons were scarring the steel board. Again. And again. And again...

""Tailypo..! Tailypo..! Give me back my tailypo!""

As she had done before, Lori seized another collector's plate and the painted foxhound sailed across the room and hit the bottom of the door. With a raucous hiss, the thing pulled its sharp nails away. After staring at the quiet, scuffed, steel board for uncountable minutes, Lori relented to her seat.

Three hours had painfully passed on the clock and despite the sofa cushions being soft, the woman remained stiff as a plank of wood. Her mind would not rest with knowing that this... talking thing might return.

And she was right.

""You know... and I know... that you have my tailypo...""

This time, the voice sounded... scathing. The padding of clawed paws on roof tiles was resounding and analogous to a cat bantering a bird.

""Please... just, just go away!"" pleaded Lori, tears stinging her bloodshot eyes. ""I don't have anything that belongs to you!""

The clawing was circling, however, not just randomly. But right above Lori's tilted scalp. It circled again. And again. And again...

""You know... and I know... that you have my tailypo!""

Feeling desperate and frustrated, the fretful woman grabbed the last collector's plate, unlocked the front door, and pitched the bloodhound artwork at where she heard the angry, accusing tone.

After the smash, she ran back in and barred the abraded entrance. Lori ogled at the ceiling, waiting for any signs of whatever was terrorizing her. When the only thing that greeted her was silence, Lori exhaled sharply and went to return to the sofa.

But her feet and breath froze when she found that her seat was occupied.

The creature had somehow crept its way inside when Lori had thrown the last plate and it must have found her scent on the small furniture's fabric. It stood up on all fours as big, round, bright yellow eyes locked onto the woman's quivering form.

Never in her life, did Lori witness anything so abnormal and so nightmarish. The thing was covered in dull, matted, black fur. Wide bear-like paws with talons that looked like they could slice rocks. And a short muzzle that harbored incalculable, serrated canines and molars; right below a pair of tufted, pointy ears that were atop a broad head. Its shape was somewhat akin to a bobcat. And it was about the size of one, as well.

But this certainly was no bobcat. 

""You've got my tailypo!"" snarled the thing before nimbly skulking out of sight. ""Give me back my tailypo!""

Its voice was laced with so much rage and was so loud, that Lori couldn't pinpoint where it was.

She heard the rustling of the bathroom's shower curtain...

A creak of a dining room chair...

Kitchen pans were being jostled...

Then, the woman caught a knee-jerking glimpse of a bumped lamp in the parlor, cutting off the room's light.   

""Give me back my tailypo!""

""I-I told you..!"" Lori stammered while shuffling backwards. ""I, I-I don't have your tailypo!""

""Yes... you... have!"" The fast, unseen creature's claws clacked on the surrounding walls. ""Yes...you... HAVE!""

""I DON'T have it!"" the woman yelled at a fallen picture in a narrow hallway.

Soon as she backed up into the bedroom, pointy ears manifested from under a dresser, followed by bright yellow eyes, now flickering fiery red. 

""Yes... you... DO!"" it decreed, slinking right in front of its gasping target. ""I saw you TAKE it!""

The growling thing was now lowering itself to the bedroom's carpet with its knuckle-sized nub waggling with predatory excitement. And with instant insight, Lori blinked hard. Her dilated pupils franticly flicked to the far end of the creature's stout appendage, and it dawned on her. The stub held a large wound from an injury...

The injury from the car incident with the tail.

""YES! You're right!"" Lori shouted, holding up trembling hands. ""It's HERE!""

The thing halted its advancement. Its bristled haunches and posture eased down.

""Where is it?"" asked the thing. The inhuman voice seemed calmer and was no longer booming. ""Where is my tailypo..?"" 

""I'll get your tailypo! Just wait!""

The thing rested on its haunches as its head swiveled with large eyes leering at the rushing, cautious woman like an owl eyeing a rodent. She went to her kitchen freezer and pulled out a bag. And within it was the bundled-up large rag.

Quickly, she returned to the bedroom with the awaiting creature.

""Here, here!"" Lori tossed the big bundle to the floor. ""Here's your dang tailypo!""

In that instant, the thing lunged atop its sheathed prize, instigating Lori to rear up to her bed's baseboard. She watched in frightened captivation as the thing tore into the cold paper and frozen fabric, revealing the folded-up, extended tail. The creature craned its slanted wide head at the big being before it.

""It, it was an accident,"" Lori peeped as she edgily tapped her fingernails. ""I'm sorry I hurt your-""

""You... saved my tailypo?"" queried the thing, its eyes now back to their bright yellow shade.

The cagy woman licked her dried lips and feigned a grin.

""Yes... Yes, I did.""

What she didn't tell it was this was only partially true. She'd only preserved the eerie appendage to throw it away after the weekend. But there was no way on earth that she was going to admit that to the capricious creature. 

The thing stared down at its repossessed appendage. And while Lori wondered what it would do, it snatched the frosted furred tail and began to devour the detached part of itself.

Lori clung to her mouth as the thing crunched and champed away at the frozen solid meat, bones, and tendons with ease as if it had not eaten in weeks. And as it gulped down the dismembered icy chucks of marrow and stiff flesh, the sounds of the cracking of cold glass and stretching of wet rope resonated from the hungry thing... Tailbones were materializing, along with intertwining sinews and muscles from its lanky, dark backside. And drips of crimson from the forming, pulsing veins and arteries stained the carpet below the disconcerting phenomenon. 

Both palms were covering Lori's open mouth as the growing appendage outstretched from the creature. And as the thing finished with its... meal, so did the regeneration of its new, fully furred, black tail. Which was now, twice the extent of its visible, bony spine.

With a peculiar, purplish tongue, the thing licked its frosty, short muzzle and refocused its attention on the woman who was wishing she hadn't backed herself into a room without anything to defend herself. But undoubtedly, kitchen utensils wouldn't be a match for the steak knife talons nor all those ice-pick fangs.

However, since the creature seemed appeased, perhaps Lori could reason with it...

""Now, that you've... got it back,"" she began meekly, ""could you please... go?""

""Yes... I've got my tailypo... But... go..?"" 

The thing's eyes gleamed red.

""...Nooo...""            

""N-N-N-No?"" Lori stuttered. ""But, but you've got your tailypo! Wh-what do you want now?!""

""I want..."" The crouching creature's lanky withers were wriggling. ""...to HUNT!""

With a scream that surely would have awoken the dead, Lori dropped to the floor as the thing sprang forth. Getting back on shaky feet, she went for the bedroom's exit and readied to shut its door but paused partway. Because the thing had not lunged at her, but for her mattress.

With raised eyebrows, Lori warily looked on as the thing pounced upon the bed pillow with its hefty, clawed paws, yet the fabric casing remained unscathed. And when the creature sat up, the woman squinted for better discernment.

Between its lifted, long nails was something small with twinging, reedy legs and a red hourglass mark underneath a round, dark carapace...

The thing had caught a black widow spider.

Lori stood there, agape. All her fear, all her anguish from this hellish, bizarre night was deflected by seeing that the highly venomous arachnid had been nesting in her bed.

And the dang spider was within Lori's pillow. Her pillow! Had she fallen asleep like she'd planned...

The thing flipped the dangling, half-dead black widow into its ready magenta maw and snapped its jaws. Then, it stared back at Lori like a smug feline that swallowed the canary.

""You eat... s-spiders?"" the woman uttered. ""Even the deadly ones?""

""Yes..,"" was the odd, multiple-tone reply. ""Fun to hunt... Fun to catch...""   

Lori slowly nodded. That must've been the reason why this creature was trying to get inside the house from the beginning. This caused a new revelation to arise in Lori's mind, and not in a good way.

Hearing distant booms, the woman tightly crossed her arms over a beating chest. The odd chill had returned. But it wasn't from the incoming storm, nor the strange animal that was serenely blinking and sitting on the bed.

""Are... are there any..."" Lori cleared her throat. ""...ahem... more in this house?""

The thing swerved its wide face from side to side, flaring its black nostrils. Then, its large irises flashed red from both the lightning and expectation. 

""Yesss..,"" it hissed delightfully over the thunder. ""Many... many... more...""

Anxiously, Lori veered her view to the cottony square on where she lays her head, then to the crooning creature coiling its new, extensive tail over gaunt hindquarters. Again. And again. And again...

***

For the past two months, folks at work were discussing how all the rain had been enticing all the eight-legged critters to invade their homes. Surprisingly, their arachnophobic co-worker didn't seem fazed by this unnerving news in the slightest. And whenever they inquired why she was not worried, she would always explain that she didn't need to bother to fret about something that'd never happen in her house.

One quite stormy evening, while Lori contently slumped in her cozy bed, she motioned a brush like she's been doing for the last eight weeks. After a few more minutes, she leaned an arm above a big bowl on the floor that had been cleared of meat and gravy, placed the brush on a nightstand, and turned off its lamp.

When the woman felt the added weight leave her lap, she slid down between the soft blanket and mattress. Lori's lips curved into a secure smile when something shifted above her head and curled along her pillow...

Something that was covered in sleek, black fur, wearing a sharp, toothy grin and an embellished, ruby, and gold collar.

And closing dimming yellow eyes, a long, thick, shiny tail that was twice the length of its fattened torso, was draped over the sleeping being's collarbone.

""Tailypo... Tailypo..."" it sighed blissfully. ""Now, we've got our new tailypooo...""

But when I first got sober the one thing that took away all cravings was sugar. This created horrible habits and “comfort eating” as my night cap lol.

I wait ten months a year for something that will last merely two months. Two months of my year, still feels like it's more than one year. I love summer. During those two months I feel alive, and I feel home. Those two months feel like home. When I wake up to my grandmother making breakfast in the morning after she's just been in the church, or waking up at six AM to help her in the garden... This is a feeling you can only feel if you've been raised as a Polish kid. The crumbling communist apartment is disgusting and old, yet it's home. I wouldn't change it for anything. Waking up and hearing cars roaring on the street oustide. We live on the second to last story. It's just about a 13 meter jump down to the ground. I sit on the balcony while my family cleans after the dinner, and I feel at home, just looking at people going by. The people I'm looking at are people that live there. They don't feel anything extraordinary, this is just another monday for them. We have plans to go to the beach, and then with my aunt and brother on a trip with her dog. I can't wait to go to the beach, the weather is scorching hot outside - 38 degrees celsius. My mother sits down at the sofa, and drinks coffee. I get mad at her for taking so long - I just want to go to the beach. It's weird, since even in my happiest moments, when I'm \*home\*, I still find things to get mad at. We finally go to the beach. It's a 15 minute walk through the city. Our town isn't huge. It's about the size of an average small town. It's a medieval town next to one of the biggest lakes in Poland. Young people going on dates and old people walking with their dogs. All of them have their own stories to tell, maybe most of them were even in a war or two... I see the bustling market where elderly people sell clothes they made or vegetables they grew. That's wholesome. We finally reach the beach. We buy some ice cream and jump in the water. The water is 28 degrees celsius, perfect for a scorching hot day. We come home and eat Rosół. After rosół, we go on a trip with my aunt, my brother and my aunts dog. We play loud music in the car, and we drive through a muddy road in the middle of nowhere. The sun is piercing the windows in the car, and the huge plants of corn are waving in the wind. I love being at the Polish countryside in the summer. Old people with headscarves screaming at kids to stop playing football in their garden.... the smell of real Polish pierogi coming through the old wooden windows.... It's life man... We go home where we sit for a few hours, my cousins visit and we play a few games together. They get drunk and dance, when they are drunk they talk nonsense and everyone thinks it's funny. I love them, and they love me. We go on a walk, walking past the shops, cars and old churches... The sound of summer, people walking on the streets, no rain, cars and people laughing... old church bells... We arrive back at home where my sister waits for me. It's already dark outside. It's 11 PM. We get the computer and put on a movie while everyone is asleep. The apartment is extremely small, barely fits two people yet somehow we fit eight of us here... Everyone is tight asleep. My sister says she is sleepy and falls asleep. I take one last look out the balcony before the day dies down, and falls asleep together with the new memories I made today. I sit on the balcony and look at the lights slowly turning off in the neighboring apartments. A car drives by occasionally, once a few minutes I hear a drunk man screaming. Maybe somewhere a policecar drives by... I love it. I love the people, I love the culture, I love the language, I love the traditions, Catholicism, nature, food, architecture, mindset of people, our apartments, roads, beaches, forests, smells, ups and downs, drunk and sober men, old people, young people, my aunt, my grandma, my family...

Read Carefully and Understand if You Really want to Manifest SP. Post Gonna be little Long. 
I ll elaborate everything in detail with Timeline. 

March 2019
First time I saw My SP on random shop. I literally didn't know her. But something clicked my inner self said "" She is the one "" 
She left the place. That moment I closed my eyes and Prayed.."" Hey Universe God..I wanna know her.. wanna meet her for once.. PLEASE 🙏 ""

April 2019
Few weeks later I received request on Instagram. when I checked profile she was the exact same girl I saw few weeks ago. She texted me "" Do we know each other ? "" 
I was shocked How on the earth is this possible ? 
We started talking ( not conversation but just talk ) 

July 2019 :First meet 
It was her last day in my city she was about to move to different city. Soo we met for coffee that evening n next day for breakfast. 
I was happy and felt amazing. Bcus god fullfilled my wish as I wanted to meet her. 

She moved to different city. Then I came to know she has Bf ( 3P ) they were in relationship for 5-6 yrs. Conversation was very rare as she moved to different city. I kinda lost hope. 

Then I came across law of Attraction 
It says "" Imagine person with you NOW..and Feel Good.."" that's it. 
I didn't know about other things. I was like ok. Let's do this fun activity as my end goal was to feel good inside. 

Soo I used to Imagine myself with her. Like at coffee shop. At bar counter. Having late night video call. Winter night walk holding each others hand. 
I denied all circumstances unknowingly. I wanted to feel good in that moment as she is with me. 
I did this fun activity for few months. 

Oct 2019
She decided to move to hometown. She moved to her hometown and Started living with 3P. Live in relationship. 
I kinda lost all hopes. I was like I am fooling myself. I am just day dreaming. Like idiot.
We almost lost all contacts. No text no communication. 
I decided to move on. I deleted all social media. All her contacts. 
I kinda moved on. 

Feb 2020 
Pandemic Happened.
I moved to my hometown . Then after that I got involved with my family. I forgot about her completely.
 I was like she is with her bf must be living happily together forever.

June 2021. ( After Two Years ) 
I moved back to city for my exams. 
I was like ok it's been two years let's get back to social media. I created new account in Sept 2021.

Oct 2021. 
I received call from unknown number.
Guess what? It was SP.. she was like "" I am in the city where are you ? I was like ok I am the same city moved back few months ago. She was like ok let's meet. 

Nov 2021. 
We met after 2 yrs. We started talking meeting over coffee breakfast lunch dinner. Things where completely different this time. 
She was the one who used to call text asking for dinner. 

Then one night she kissed me after romantic dinner date. She proposed me.We started dating. 

One moment something hit me hard. 
I was like wait a second.
Why does it feels like I have already experienced this things before ? 
Coffee ☕.. dinner.. winter night walk holding each others hand..

Then I realised.. omg It was all my imagination script playing out in reality. 
That's is MANIFESTION. 
Things I imagined once in my mind just for fun are playing out exactly as it is in 3D world. 

That moment I realised this law works 💯. Without even doubt exactly as it is.

My learning n what I experienced n why I got my SP successfully ?? 

1. I was doing it for fun just to feel good in present moment. Not to get out of it in future.
People tend to do this mistake. They imagine to get results. I imagined for fun not to get any results. Means I wasn't attached to outcome. I wasn't looking or waiting it to happen. 

My mindset was like.. I want to feel good..I am missing her ..ok no problem.. let's imagine her here now...feel good n let it go.. 

2. I wasn't affirming all day. Infact I didn't even know affirmation do exist at that time in 2019. 
I wasn't aware of self concept. 3P. SP terminology. Bcue I knew very little.
  "" imagine her with you now.. Feel Good.."" that's it. No over complications no unnecessary bullshit. 

3. Who I delt with 3P situation ? 
I never put focus on 3P. I wanted to feel good I Just imagined SP n me together that's it..
I wasn't doing anything to REMOVE 3P. 

4. HOW long it takes ? 
When wil happen ? 
I never attached to outcome. Soo eventually I wasn't focusing on Outcome or time n how n when factors. 
Bcus I was with her all the time in NOW moment. everytime I missed her. I just imagined her with me. Soo I got my feeling good experience. Why should I worry about future or how or when 

5. It feels like psycho to do this stuff sometimes. Fooling yourself. Imagining your person with you when they are not with you. But whatever ot takes to feel good. 

6. Manifestion is BYPRODUCT. 
Things I imagined in 2019 eventually reflected as it is in 2021. Like I wrote script in my mind. I lived that script in my mind first. Then after 2 yrs I was actually experiencing it in Reality. 

7. How do you feel before you experience your imagination or At what moment it happens ?? 

To be honest. Manifestion happens when you are least expecting it to happen. It feels like magic. Wait a second I wasn't expecting that to happen. Like shock or surprise. 

8. How does it feels after getting you Manifestion ? Or person pr SP ? 

Initially you feel good. But after that you feel normal. You don't feel excited all the time. 

9. What's my suggestion ? 
Do it for fun to feel good in present moment 
Don't expect outcome. It happens automatically 
Focus on your personal life as well 
SP is just another person. Trust me. No need to put them on pedestal. They aren't special. They are just like you. It's you who consider them as special. 
Do it to experience future in NOW. 
People Imagine to get FUTURE. that's wrong approach. 

10. Actions ? 
You don't need to do anything. No need to remove 3P. Noo need to worry about distance issue different city country. Just stick to your story. You and SP together NOW. UNIVERSE TAKES CARE OF EVERYTHING. 

11. TECHNIQUES DON'T MANIFEST 
It's Tool To reach that Feeling. I never did affirmation. I just imagined. Don't create whole movie in one go. Keep scene for 5-10 sec. Try it to be real. People imagine all aspects in one go.
"" driving convertable ferrari in italy sitting next to SP...SP proposing on knees with tiffiny dimond ring "" it's possible but keep things simple. Walking down the street holding hands. Bcus subconscious accepts this simple daily routine Stuff easily you don't need to force it to accept. 

12. Don't put too much time in Manifestion. 
No one knows when it will happen. It may happen tomorrow.. next month.. 5 yrs later..20 yrs later.. no one knows when it happens In reality.. not discouraging but it's fact. 

13. Don't get trapped in Manifestion loop. 
Live for yourself first. Then comes everything. You desire is bcus of you.

Do I risk blowing up any future chances by asking for something more casual like a FWB situation?,"I met this girl on hinge, texted for a few weeks, and really hit it off on our first date. During, both of us agreed it was one of our best first dates. Ended with walking her to her car, kissing, and wishing her well.

From there, we ended up hanging out another 5-6 times over the next 2 weeks. We each had a great time hanging out with each other and would text each other at least a small amount daily

The only not great part of our first few dates was on our second date. Hanging out at my place after watching a movie, led to heavy make out, she took her shirt off, and I asked her if she wanted to go to the bedroom. She said yes, we made our way there, annnnndddd I couldn’t get it up. I think she’s gorgeous, but this wasn’t exactly a shock for me. I’ve never been able to get hard my first time having sex with anybody. I’ve chalked it up to nerves, and told her it wasn’t anything related to her. I just get massive nerves, and she could tell that a little bit because I was bouncing my knee like crazy when she was making out on top of me. That led to her taking off, us both disappointed in the failed sex attempt, and she texted me when she got home that she was incredibly embarrassed, telling me she felt like she pushed me too quick. We both apologized to each other, felt embarrassment, but ended the conversation saying that we still were very much into each other but I suggested we take it a lil slower.

After that, we continued to hang out a few more times. All of which were great! I could tell I felt a lot more comfortable around her, and we began cutesy drunk texting each other a few nights. I asked her if I could come over, she appreciated the boldness, but said it was too late and she had taken some stuff to help her sleep. No problem with me whatsoever, can always ask her another time. All this to say, I was communicating sex was on the table for me and I wanted it lol. We then hung out Saturday, got drinks and dinner, but then she went home saying she felt super sick from a previous night of drinking and needed to go home solo. I offered to pick her up anything she needed to feel better, she declined. She kept texting me though throughout the night about how sweet I was and called me her “boo” lol. 

This past Sunday she said she felt much better and surprised me by taking me out to an old coffee shop in town that I haven’t been to in years for a surprise date idea. She only knew about the shop because I had mentioned it to her, so it was very much geared specifically toward me. Afterward she dropped me off to get lunch with her friends, but then invited me over to watch a movie at her place. I came into this hangout ready for sex. We hung out, watched the movie, and then after the movie she said she was getting tired so I didn’t bring up sex. 

I leave Sunday thinking all is well, and then Monday morning, 12 hours later, she texts me asking if she can call me later. I already know where this is going, I ask if we’re okay, and she says she doesn’t think so. She then calls me and explains that she likes me, but she was previously divorced (she explained this to me on first date, wasn’t bothered by it at all). I haven’t really pressed into the details of her divorce since I’m wanted to get to know her for who she is now and not judge her for any of her past relationships. I never asked for details or brought it up as a concern. Because of this, I don’t have a full grasp on timeline. I think she got divorced 1-1.5 years ago, and she just got her own solo place (lived at parents previously) for just 3 months. The gist of what she said to me on the call was that 1) her friends have heard about her seeing me and were concerned that she hasn’t taken enough time to live solo and enjoy being single and 2) she may not have agreed with her friends at first but now does. She said she didn’t expect to like me so much since we have so many similar interests. I was crying on the phone as she told me, and she began crying too. I didn’t argue with her in any capacity, I just tried to relate as best I could. I don’t know if she’s still grieving that relationship, but from what she told me she’s either grieving it or is still shocked from the whole divorce where she only wanted to date someone casually. I stupidly asked if I could still be in her life, she says she doesn’t think that’d be best, and we continue talking. I understand where she’s coming from and can appreciate she wants to focus on self discovery having never really lived solo. It fucking hurt, since her and I clicked and had so many interests together

I then sent her a super long text, basically summarizing what we said on the phone and any feelings I felt I didn’t get out. I told her she didn’t need to respond since she did enough explaining over the phone, but the text basically ended with “I hope at some point in the future you and I are on a similar page where this could work”. As soon I hit send, I regretted sending the text, but in retrospect it was all honest. Just maybe too intense for a 2-3 week spree of dates

I haven’t contacted her since the day she ended it. I want to see her in the future and still have feelings for her, but I know I’m emotionally confused and I’m sure she is too. I believe she is conflicted on her past divorce, but I’m wondering if she would use that as an excuse? Idk, I want to give it at least 2 weeks before I check in, but even then I feel like I’d be backtracking against what she asked for… I still really feel like we like each other, how can I go about this?? What’s a normal time frame to give somebody breathing room that they ask for? Selfishly I’d want to still spend time with her in whatever capacity, possibly FWB? But our one failed attempt at sex doesn’t give me a good track record to suggest that

What should I ask him to turn the tides?,"We’ve now gone on two short walks together (because our homes happen to be in the same direction). Both times he had a whole lineup of questions ready for me. The moment I answered one, he’d already moved on to the next.


While I appreciate his curiosity, I don’t want things to feel one-sided. I actually want to get to know him too. Next time we end up walking together, I’d love to turn the tables a bit and ask him some questions of my own. I’m just not sure where to start.


Here’s what I do know about him:

	•	He doesn’t use social media. Rarely even uses a phone.

	•	He reads constantly.

	•	He’s kind of a STEM genius.

	•	He’s very calm, almost like he’s high 24/7 (he might be), and honestly, super sweet - often giving me compliments.

	•	Big fan of coffee.

	•	Has an artistic side, which is something we have in common.

	•	Might be involved in some sketchy business.. possibly sells drugs? Who really knows.


I don’t want to ask about the usual stuff like classes - I don’t care about any of that. I want to figure out who he is as a person. But I also don’t want to seem “too much”, meaning super deep, out-of-the-blue questions are a no-go for now.

I am caffeine free 4 weeks.

Do I miss coffee, caffeine? Yeah I do but it is so rewarding when I really go to bed and I feel tired/exhausted.

The sleep is so good really. When I wake up I feel huge mood boost from sleeping so good! 

When I was on caffeine I felt terrible at morning and then boost after caffeine.

No more stress if I will have good sleep. Every sleep is not deep and amazing.

I am construction worker and even when I was working hard 12 hours and I had caffeine it was still difficult to fall asleep and maintain it.

Now I am caffeine free and I fall asleep fast and I FEEL how I am exhausted.

I feel so much happiness every night because I love how my body is telling me it is time to fall asleep. 

When I was on caffeine any sleep hacks was not working for me. 

Only 1 small coffee in morning and my sleep was messed up! 

Now in morning I drink mint or samahan tea and I am good to go. My productivity in my job is similar. I now do banana or apple instead of caffeine - this natural sugar is best boost for me.

So if ur considering it, do it now. I understand it is not good time to stop but trust me, it will be never good time. Best thing is stop when u have lot of work to do because u will forget about withdarwals symptoms.",11,1743801033.0,decaf,1,0.92,False

Started with weight loss in 2022 and into the new year of 2023 if I remember rightly. I dropped from about 14-15stone right down to just under 10 stone. Unexplained however I was going through some stress with a previous partner which could have been a huge factor or just a coincidence in the start of this illness.

October 31st 2023 woke up with what felt like norovirus, I kept dry heaving for around 30 minutes solid with nothing coming up except a small amount of brown liquid (empty stomach, Chinese for tea the night before) I understand this was probably just food colouring, it wasn’t like coffee granules which I know needs to be watched out for.

Few days go by I was absolutely fine, then all of a sudden a wave of nausea comes again, I go to be sick and nothing comes up… dry heaving AGAIN. 

From that moment every single day I can be going about my day as normal then all of a sudden waves of severe nausea comes over me from anywhere that lasts from 10 minutes to 10 hours! At the end of the nausea 99 percent of the time it’s finished and settled by my dry heaving and then only it will settle. Empty stomach or full stomach vomit never produces it’s always dry heaving.  

We are now coming upto 2 years, it’s affecting my mental health, wondering every day when it’s going to start which it happens everyday without fail, sometimes once, sometimes 20 times, there’s no pattern.

This is taking a strain on my work life, personal life, relationship with my partner and my own mental wellbeing. I can’t have a plan to do anything or normal activity’s as I’m always taking anti sickness medication around with me for the nausea for bad flare ups (ondansatron) 

It’s not getting better, it’s the same or worse at times.

I can sometimes have a stool movement which is normal and then not long after need to go again which a small amount comes out including a tiny minimal amount of mucus, not always but it happens at times every few days to weeks. 

Would like to mention I’ve put weight back on and no issues with weight as I’m not losing any or anything dramatic like I did, I haven’t weighed myself since I dropped so low however I’d like to think I’m about 13 stone now maybe slightly more. 6ft 1 in height. 

Exercise- recently started playing football, when bursting into runs after around 10-15 minutes into every game I have to stop and stand at the sideline to dry heave a few times then I can continue. 

From my own research, it points towards one of these which I feel I should be tested for, some have been tested for but in my opinion needs re testing as symptoms still haven’t changed and only gotten worse: 

- Colon Cancer (or cancers in general) 
- Superior mesenteric artery syndrome
- GERD
- IBS/IBD
- Food/any intolerances 
- Gallbladder 
- Esophageal candidiasis


My previous endoscopy found the following:
- Esophageal candidiasis (don’t know if this has gone or not due to not having any following ups or check ups from anybody. No indication or anyone telling me the causes of this. 

Other previous results which may or may not be playing a factor:
- Calprotectin 110ug/g (lowered on the follow up test right back down) 
- 2023 November, prolactin levels high (628) during hospital stay 
- HIVscreen: Negative 
- CT Scan… Incidental hypodense focal lesion on Right lobe of liver

Final additional notes which could or could not be a factor, as symptoms started and I haven’t felt right since also: 
X2 Pfizer Covid Vaccines (June 2021) 


I understand this is a lot of things going on, but I need to desperately find an answer on what this could be. This is an open timeline for which I want to share with you the reader, doctor, specialists & online forums,

Any ideas, help, similar stories would be greatly appreciated.

Right now, we’re in the **early prototype stage** and want to make sure we’re building something truly helpful. That means listening directly to you — the people living with OA every day.

If you're open to it, we’d love to:

* Do a quick **15–20 minute call or Zoom** to hear about your experience.
* Or, if you’re near **St. Louis**, we’d be happy to meet in person (coffee on us!).
* Or even just answer a few questions here in the comments or via DM.

Your insights will directly shape how we build this — no pressure, just a genuine effort to learn and design better.

Dandy Blend has been a lifesaver. This has become my morning replacement beverage and I actually enjoy it. And nice that I can have a cup anytime in the afternoon or evening too.

1jrmisd,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1jrmisd/i_fought_kde_bugs_for_weeks_my_cat_solved_it_in/,I Fought KDE Bugs for Weeks. My Cat Solved It in Seconds,"I've been using Linux since 2017. My first and daily distro has always been Debian with Xfce. While I’ve mostly kept my setup pretty conservative, I occasionally get the urge to try something new.

A few weeks ago, I decided to experiment with the latest version of KDE. I started with KDE Neon, and while I really liked the look and feel, it turned out to be quite buggy. The screen would break in various ways, there was a lot of tearing while watching YouTube videos, Discover had weird blue lines, and there were many other visual issues. So, I decided to go back to Debian.

This time, for a bit of a change, I went with Debian Testing and installed the KDE Plasma version of Trixie. I was aiming for that “latest and greatest” experience on Linux, something I’ve generally avoided, because every time I’ve tried a rolling-release distro, it ended in disaster after an update. Debian Testing felt like a good compromise: newer packages, but not completely bleeding-edge.

At first, things were great. I could watch YouTube, write programs, and run local LLMs with performance similar to what I had with Xfce. But then the problems started creeping in. Microstuttering appeared, and games became nearly unplayable. *Counter-Strike 2* wouldn’t even run properly, and *Garry’s Mod* turned into a brown visual mess.

YouTube began stuttering constantly, regardless of resolution or framerate. Some videos even played with audio while the video stayed completely frozen. I also started seeing interlacing artifacts in Kdenlive and VLC. To make it worse, text across the desktop began to look blurry and garish, like I was reading it through an old RF cable connection. (If you ever used 8-bit micros in the '80s, you know exactly what I mean.)

I was considering trying out a GNOME-based distro like **Zorin OS**, or maybe finally giving **Fedora** another shot. (I hadn’t touched it since Fedora 34, and back then my machine really struggled with it.)

So, I started downloading Fedora. While it was downloading, I went to make myself a coffee. Meanwhile, my screen locked... and my cat, being the helpful creature he is, decided to sit down on the keyboard.

When I came back and unlocked the machine, I noticed something strange: **all my programs were closed**, and, miraculously, the **text on my screen looked perfectly crisp**. I had previously tried *everything in the book* to fix that issue, and nothing had worked.

Confused but intrigued, I resumed the Fedora download and also grabbed **OpenMandriva**, just in case (I have another machine running it beautifully).

Then I started testing things:
- Kdenlive ran smoothly.
- YouTube had zero stutters.
- Steam actually opened at the right size! (Did I mention how, before, Steam looked comically tiny, and trying to scale it up somehow made it even *smaller*?)

Suddenly, everything was working perfectly.

I was scratching my head, trying to figure out which update could've fixed it... until I opened the system settings and checked *About This System*. Right there, it said:

> **Graphics Platform: X11**

It all made sense. Wayland had been the root of all my problems, and somehow, my cat had unknowingly switched the session manager to X11... and fixed everything.

We both believe in no sex before marriage and take dating seriously. I would like to date for a while (couple of years) before marriage. And she wants to take longer (5+ ish years). And I'm fine with that, I want both of us to be comfortable and sure about our choice to marry.

However the issue I have is that I have very conservative parents. They also don't know I'm dating this girl and that she's not Middle-eastern or not muslim. My parents believe that they should set up 'dates' with the family present, and for the girl they set me up with to get engaged within 2 weeks. This is all way too quick for me as I want to get to know the person well first. However my parents disagree with this. The girl I'm dating also drinks sometimes, which I'm fine with even though I don't drink myself. But I also think my parents would disapprove of that.

  
I did tell the girl I'm dating about the situation with my parents out of respect. And she's been really polite about it. However she find it difficult to decide on what to do. Because she does love spending time with me, however she's not sure about dating someone whose parents don't know about her, or parents who wouldn't approve of her. And I understand her thoughts.

She said she'd need some time to think about it. So I replied with that she can take as much time as she needs and that I'd accept any decision she'll make.

Why do you not do any?

I had a 4 in 1 machine, which didn't really work well, but that's a side issue.

To get the taste of the lovely Nespresso pods, I'd use a dolce gusto milk pod.

Fantastic, nice tasting white coffee.

If you're happy with a splash of cold milk, and have a small child friendly coffee, that's great n all, but I want a mug of coffee.

To get milky coffee, that's the only way, except a milk machine separately, or watching a microwave for that second the milk raises!

I have found d some Nespresso friendly milk pods, but all are plain skimmed milk, not even semi skimmed for some flavour. ... Reminds me of my last foster mother, who would have 4 to 6 GRANULES (yes, granules) with half a hermacitees sweeter, and a splash of full skimmed milk. 

I don't do skimmed milk, plus only available via eBay 

If Nespresso did their own milk pods, I'd have gone with a Nespresso as my replacement machine.

Instead I threw out the pods, and got a different system.

I didn't really want to go back to dolce machines, as they kept breaking after 18 months... Would chose one day to not work at all. No resetting or anything would work.

So come on someone at Nespresso, do milk pods.

Not only would I use one, but I know millions would change too.... Even those buying milk frothing machine.

Hi, all. Hope you're keeping well.

I made an update about this previously, but it deserves a new post now that so much has changed. 
Long story short is: my boss (the managing director of a very small company) spent around three months harassing me at work, and at the end of January this year, he actually fired me. 

It started off with me being pulled into a random ""enthusiasm meeting"". He said my enthusiasm was lacking and I mentioned that I'd been feeling unwell lately (which was true, and was very much at the hands of him making my workplace life miserable).
He ended up saying that we needed to figure out how to fix it, then asked if I wanted to work there and I said, ""right now, no"". Maybe my mistake, but I was honest; in that moment, I didn't want to work period, and I made it clear that I didn't feel fit to work at all, not just at that workplace, but he heard his scapegoat of me saying ""no"" and said, ""okay, well, you can either hand in your notice or I'll let you go.""

Okay, so you're firing me then. 

Ignoring the details, I ended up leaving the next day and got a job at a coffee shop through my sister, with less hours, less pay but somehow way more stress (I'm used to office jobs and structures). 

Due to the harrassment that occurred, I then filed to make a claim at the Employment Tribunal. 
He denied settling out of court before I made the claim officially, but just yesterday, he offered me three grand and said that ""the team helped me progress my career so there's no basis in my claim"" even though I'm claiming for sexual harrassment and not whatever he is referring to and it states this in the thorough ""Particulars of Claim"" form I provided. 

I intend to decline this offer and continue preparing for the tribunal, especially for three grand when my mental and physical health have taken such a huge toll since January. 

A lot of people in the first post mentioned legal things and I thought it was a little over the top, but here we are, I guess! 
I don't really have the energy to do this, but my sense of justice overrides that certainly.

He does this “fend for yourself” thing thinking it’ll make me appreciate him for what he does but the truth is, it’s so much easier for me to function than it is when he “helps” and as a result I see how much easier my life would be without him. It’ll be harder in some aspects, but it feels like he wants to overwhelm me until I break and then he gets to come in and tell me what a useless piece of shit I am.

Regardless, last night he got mad at me because I was “ignoring” him (I was dealing with 2 sick kids and trying to clean the house and stay on top of chores) he told me he was hungry but didn’t have the energy to cook, I said let me know what you want and I can make it for you, he said I’m too busy and he doesn’t want to inconvenience me. I said okay, just let me know. Maybe 20 mins later he comes back to the kitchen, angrily grabs a pot and some chicken noodle soup, makes a mess pouring it into the pot, puts it on heat and yells at me “how hard is it to do this?” I say I would have if he just told me what he wanted, I’m not a mind reader and I don’t want to waste food trying to cook him something until I figure out what he’d like. I offer to finish cooking it for him, he says he doesn’t need my help, pours the cold soup into a bowl, throws the pot in the sink and says he doesn’t know why he even tries.
Later I make the kids milkshakes before their bath after dinner, he comes down while they’re in the shower, says “thanks for asking if I want a milkshake” I apologize saying I didn’t even have one, I just wanted to make them a treat. He says I make him so miserable and I’m selfish and only think about myself. He said he hates being here so much and he just wants to kill me sometimes because I’m so stupid. I tell him pack up right now, I’ll borrow money and drive him wherever he wants because I will not tolerate being told that he wants to kill me and my life is not worth losing because of him. He says I took it out of context, he doesn’t ~actually~ want to kill me, it’s just an expression. He’s more just frustrated with himself and wants to die, but I “won’t let him”(I hid the guns a few months ago after a suicide attempt). I ask what he wants to do, he says “just not be here anymore” I ask where he wants to go, he says nowhere, he’s just tired of existing. I tell him I’m sorry he’s feeling that way, remind him he had a doctors appointment to refer him to a psychiatrist that morning which he cancelled and that every attempt I make to help him, he sabotages or rejects. I’m trying to help him, I don’t want him to suffer or be angry, but when he makes the suffering and anger for himself, I don’t know what to do? He’s a grown adult and I’m not blaming him directly for any of my problems, but he’s doing more to make things worse than he is to make them better. I understand his frustrations and I’m trying my hardest but I have to maintain my self worth and boundaries too, and I’m feeling confused about how I’m supposed to navigate this when he makes it so hostile all the time. He said I was right, it’s all his fault, he’s just a burden to me, the kids don’t even like him and getting with him was the biggest mistake I’ve made. I say I’m not trying to make you mad or think I’m such negative ways, I just want you to have help and it’s more than what I can provide and I don’t know what to do.

This morning I get the kids off to school and go back to sleep for an hour after they’re gone. When I wake up he’s sleeping on the couch. I get coffee and sit to check my morning messages on my phone, he asks what I’m doing today, I say working until the kids get home and then taking care of them, I guess? He asks when we’re going to hang out? I say he’s more than welcome to hang out with me while I work, I mostly listen to podcasts so would like the company, he says there’s no where for him to sit and it’s cold where I work and he doesn’t want to have to bundle up. I say we can hang out with the kids and he says no I just want to spend time with you alone. I say okay so I’ll work tonight and we can hang right now. And he says it’s already ruined because he had to say something and I’d be hanging out with him just because I know he wants me to and I have work to do and should just take care of what I need to. I ask what he wants me to do? He says you can just go to work. So I go to put on my work clothes, feeling rushed to have to work but don’t want to get yelled at for being lazy if I decide to finish my coffee and wake up a bit more. After I’m dressed I go back out to the living room to get water and a snack, he says “I’m just going to go up to my bed and lay down” (which I guess was supposed to translate to “that’s your queue to put on a sexy outfit and come up and make out with me and suck my dick and I’ll fuck you and then you can go to work”) I say “you can go into the bedroom if you’d like” (meaning the curtains in my room make it darker and since the sun is shining into his room, it’ll be more comfortable to rest in) he goes to the room. After 5 minutes he comes out saying “I don’t know why you even told me to go in there if you’re not going to do anything. I’m just going to go upstairs and jack off instead, do you know where my iPad is?” I say I misunderstood the context, I’m really not in the mood to be intimate with him after the last couple of days and I’ll need to be in a better place to want to do anything like that. He says what’s the point of us even being together if I won’t even help him out like that. One of the reasons he’s frustrated is because he feels like he needs to beg for sex and I never initiate it. I say every time i try to, he thinks I’m doing it because he wants me to, so it’s not really me initiating it (he’s technically right because I have zero sex drive anymore but still make attempts to dress up and pleasure him, the reality is he gets sex 3-4 times a week if not more and the only days he doesn’t get sex is when he’s gotten it for 3+ days straight and I’m sore or because he was being an asshole and I don’t want to have sex with him until he’s been nice for 2+ days but each time it happens, I just get more repulsed to the point where I’ve started crying during sex because he wants me to make out with him and look at him and I just dissociate from my body and try and fake it to make it get over with faster) 

I realize the phrasing of this mornings exchange could have implied I wanted him to go to the bed to fuck him.. but why he would assume that was the case is so shocking to me.. I’m literally exhausted from pulling his weight and mine the last week, on top of putting up with his verbal berating. My body has been used enough. My mind is starting to break. I just want to have one conversation that makes sense on both sides. ",3,1743799193.0,BPDlovedones,1,0.81,False
1jrm2nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1jrm2nm/ready_to_move_help_me_narrow_down_my_shortlist/,Ready to move - help me narrow down my shortlist!,"Getting ready to move somewhere and settle in more permanently. I'm single, male, early 30s, WFH.

Not expecting some 100% perfect match, but top of mind for me is:

* **culture of health & fitness** \- by this I mean active community, lots of access to trails/nature/etc, health conscious community, big enough for competitive adult sports leagues, etc
* **getting around** \- walkable or bikeable, traffic levels, public transport is a nice to have (but I'm realistic with how much of a limiting factor this is in US cities)
* **culture / entertainment** \- concerts & festivals, sports teams, tech scene / entrepreneurial scene, conferences, museums, theater, galleries, etc
* **safe & chill, but fun** \- would like to be in a pocket or neighborhood somewhere not riddled with crime / drugs / homelessness / chaos, but maybe 5-20 minutes aware from more of the action and offerings... overall though, prefer my day to day to be peaceful
* **community** \- in terms of the people around me, will I be surrounded by intellectuals, entrepreneurs, highly ambitious people, community minded people, inclusive people, etc
* **climate & aesthetics** \- how visually appealing is the city (cleanliness, modern architecture, nature around) how much sunshine, how good is the weather
* **daily comforts** \- would love to be somewhere surrounded by a good coffee/cafe culture, libraries & bookstores, farmer's markets, coworking spots - stuff I try to make use of all the time
* **food scene!** quality, quantity, diversity

COL is not a dealbreaker for me, but it's obviously a part of the consideration...I make about $200K so I can afford most spots, but the most expensive spots still give me some heartburn.

My shortlist, in no particular order... I'll add a couple quick thoughts of my own right now, but more curious to get the perspectives of folks here!

* big city adjacent:
   * **Cambridge, MA** \- expensive and would sacrifice on weather and nature here pretty hard, but I think apart from that it ticks most of the boxes
   * **Arlington, VA** \- not quite as expensive as Cambridge, better weather/sun, close to family in NC - maybe a little less action than being Boston adjacent though
* big city:
   * **Chicago, IL** \- think this is similar to Cambridge/Boston, just more affordable and loses out on the intellectual scene MIT/Harvard/etc provide (which I do value)
   * **Santa Monica, CA** \- this feels like an amazing fit on paper, I'm just apprehensive on the traffic, COL, and homeless issues
* mid size:
   * **Austin, TX** \- lived here before and I miss it more now that I'm gone, just ticks a lot of the boxes on paper and have a full friend group here to tap back into which is a big perk
   * **Boulder, CO** \- seems to be a strong fit, I'm just not 100% sure if it's a bit too small for where I am in life... or if the type of people that end up here are right up my alley (like I'd rather have a smaller total pool of people I really vibe with, versus an enormous pool where only some small fraction I have to really seek out are fits with my values/interests)... also read it might be a suboptimal landing spot when single and 30s (not in the college town demographic anymore), but this could just be Reddit nonsense

Others I have considered:  
Hoboken, NJ (think it's too expensive though and I've done NYC before)  
San Diego, CA (maybe hot take but I'm slightly underwhelmed in terms of what you pay for the relative amount of entertainment/amenities, food scene, sprawl...weather is obviously wonderful and an active/fit scene)  
Scottsdale, AZ (I liked the desert scene a lot more than I expected, COL very reasonable, also kind of a sprawl and comparatively limited on amenities/entertainment/culture/food vs the others here, also brutal summers)",5,1743799146.0,SameGrassButGreener,17,1.0,False

When the galaxy first encountered the tiny, inconsequential mammalians known as humans, there was little fanfare. They were a little-known species in a quiet corner of the galaxy, just taking their first steps out into the cosmos.

Their planet was of no value whatsoever. Their system, Sol - completely devoid of any natural resources that would make it even *remotely interesting*. An utterly mundane, boring little ball of green and blue parked quietly among an equally boring number of other little balls, floating quietly in a boring little corner of the most boring space you can imagine.

In fact, imagine the whole thing dressed up in a boring grey suit, going to work for an accounting firm that that does the accounts for an insurance company that insures against mild weather inconveniences, and you still won't understand how truly dull the whole place is.

It was understandable then, that nobody really cared when humans finally left their solar system. Mostly, we just wanted them to keep their tedium to themselves and leave the partying to the rest of us.

But oh, no.

The first human spacecraft - a stunningly typical rocket-shaped object (who could've seen that coming), carried an uninteresting 'diplomat' who wanted to 'open a dialogue' with it's galactic neighbours.

It died of a catastrophic life support failure two days into its voyage. The Takkan race were particularly unnerved, pondering at great length over why this puny race would deliver a corpse to their doorstep. A corpse, I should note, that carried a variety of *quite deadly* diseases. The entire craft was incinerated, and a polite notice was sent to their home planet, Earth, requesting that they refrain from firing any further biological weapons into Takkan space in the future. They claimed they were just trying to be nice, but agreed.

Technically, they kept their word.

The next spacecraft to arrive in Takkan space was unmanned. Unfortunately, it experienced a failure in it's guidance system, and entered the atmosphere of their home planet at 60 kilometres per second. It was mostly incinerated, save for a few highly toxic chunks of engine, which landed in a densely populated area. It was pure luck that there were no casualties, but there was significant property damage and significant clean up efforts were required. The humans later claimed that they were just trying to be friendly.

The Takkan were the first to suspect that their galactic neighbours may be something a little more than boring. They might actually be dangerous. While it was hard to imagine a hairless, clothed ape with a fuzzy head being dangerous, the evidence was mounting quickly.

Another notice was sent to Earth. This one; much less polite. Angry words were exchanged, and threats were made, but the Takkan made their point clearly: Leave. Us. Alone.

Yet, it continued.

A significantly more advanced communications relay was sent to a point between Earth and the Takkan home world. Humanity poured their best resources into the effort; equipping it with a powerful fission reactor, long-range communications equipment, triple redundant guidance systems - the works. They were careful not to intrude in Takkan space this time, parking it carefully on the edge of their territory, where it was watched around the clock by a small number of Takkan patrol craft for the full three solar cycles it lasted before self-destructing due to an uncontrolled fission reaction, destroying three patrol craft in the process.

The outcry was immediate. The Takkan were now convinced that the humans were not boring. They were extremely dangerous, because they were *idiots*.

They were instructed, in no uncertain terms, to *stay there*, and let a Takkan diplomatic delegation come to them.

To their credit, they complied. The delegation arrived at their planet without incident. They arrived in orbit without any problems whatsoever. Even atmospheric flight was achieved with not so much as an attempt at ""helping"", in their own doomed-to-failure way. Right up until the delegation was landing. For some absolutely incomprehensible reason, a group of humans started launching small, bright, explosive projectiles into the air to celebrate their arrival.

The Takkan, prepared for this now-familiar tactic of *weaponised incompetence*, immediately returned fire. The offending humans were subsequently peppered with laser fire before the Takkan vessel turned around, and left. All diplomatic ties were cut and the humans were warned to expect a war if they ever so much as sent a stray radio signal into Takkan territory ever again.

In many ways, the Takkan took the smartest approach at dealing with the humans.

The Gorellians were not so fortunate. Upon learning that humans were not so boring as they might've imagined, they just couldn't help but wonder at the possibilities a new alien culture might hold. They carefully opened communications channels, requesting a simple access to their communications networks only, hoping to limit any possible collateral damage, and start building a dialogue, slowly.

The Gorellian communications networks were immediately and catastrophically inundated with billions upon billions of the *most mundane, useless, utterly stupid* videos they'd ever encountered. Just, billions of videos of small animals doing day-to-day, normal, mundane things. An equal number, if not more, of humans either colliding their genitals together like atoms in a particle accelerator, or ""dancing"" to the *dullest* attempt at music they'd every heard.

A quick side note: do not ever attempt to listen to human music. It is a masterclass in how to create utterly shameful audio torture guaranteed to make any sentient creature confess to any crime in order to turn it off. It largely consists of a single, repeating beat and mostly four notes, on repeat. It is banned in 98% of the known galaxy.

Even after they'd disconnected, Gorellian communications took months to recover. Catastrophic damage was done to their economy, and to this very day, horror stories are told to children about videos of human pets that continue to lurk in long-forgotten communications nodes.

The Gorellians brought the issue before the galactic council. Fearful of what the humans might do if they made any more attempts at diplomacy, the galactic council did the what any sensible being would do. They sent lawyers.

The full contingent of Prood legal experts descended on Earth. Of the eighty that were sent, sixteen succumbed to untamed Earth illnesses. Four more were eaten, and an astonishing twenty were killed in vehicular accidents.

Although their losses were great, they secured a legally binding contract that ensured humanity would never leave their corner of space. They were free to expand however they wished, unimpeded and unhindered by any chance of wars or interference. So long as they left everyone else alone and made no attempt to be nice, or friendly, or anything of that nature.

And so, the party continued. And humanity blew up a moon.

Fearful of dangerously dull, densely dunce-like debris being expelled into their territory, the Takkan demanded the galactic council investigate.

The humans had been mining. *Mining*. *A small fusion accident*, they called it.

The Takkan quadrupled their research budget into defensive technologies and withdrew from the closest border outposts to human space.

When the Takkan detected a previously stable gas giant being devoured by a black hole in human space, they demanded another explanation.

*Science*, they called it this time.

Years later, an entirely mechanical fleet claiming to be ""Zolon"" emerged from human territory. The great Zolon conflict lasted eight more years, and later emerged to be a result of human research into automated terraforming. *Terraforming.*

A team of archivists was sent recover any available information about these horrifyingly incompetent humans from the Gorellian communications incident, and the result of their investigations sent shivers through the galaxy.

They accidentally burned entire cities to the ground. Purposefully ingested poisons and addictive substances. Committed acts of genocide against each other due to minor genetic variations. Killed millions of their own kind in conflicts lasting tens of years, or longer. The list was endless. Societies built on stupidity. Ideas based on ignorance. Machines borne out of mindlessness. The most insidiously brainless species ever to exist, tucked away in the most boring area of space ever discovered, like the universe's version of a cruel, twisted joke of a bomb just waiting to go off.

A new galactic entity was established. The Human Containment Initiative, or HCI. With the budget of a galactic defence force, their only task was to contain this unprecedented threat so that life elsewhere in the galaxy would have a chance at survival. Their approach was somewhat unorthodox, but bold problems require bold solutions.

They *cooperated*. And rebranded. The Human Cooperation Initiative.

They sent droves of highly trained, heavily armed and well-protected engineers, scientists and diplomats directly into human territory, sent there to stop them from blowing themselves up, exploding any more moons, or imploding any more stars, or accidentally wiping out all life in the known galaxy while trying to operate a coffee machine. We gave them what they wanted; A friend, kept at arms length.

An uneasy peace emerged from this initiative, one that continues to this day, and one that may very well have saved the universe from early extinction. But make no mistake - the only reason we're all alive today is because when humanity reached out, over, and over, and over again, somebody finally stood up and said:

""Wait, please, stop, we'll be your friends, just please, stop.""",123,1743799079.0,HFY,17,0.98,False

He makes these snark comments when I’m eating or doing something and will say “You going to clean that after” and it pisses me off because I’m the one who does all the cleaning and does the whole organizing in the house and everything. I just felt that was arrogant of him to say when it wasn’t necessary and the audacity of it, meanwhile I have to wipe his piss off the toilet everytime he uses the bathroom, or clean his beard trimmings out of the sink when he shaves. He’s the one who doesn’t clean up after himself and the audacity of him to say that to me in the tone he did just really irked the hell out of me. Now this morning I couldn’t find my coffee lid and I simply asked him where he put it because he’s constantly touching things of mine and putting them in places they shouldn’t be, or where stuff belongs. It irked me once again cause now I am in a hurry and have to get out the door but would love my coffee to take with. So now I’m vigorously  looking in cupboards and drawers in the kitchen trying to find my coffee lid and other areas in the kitchen and he comes into the room again but this time holding up his phone pointing it right at me.

In a confessional he says the woman can clear an acre in a hour. His papi would love a woman that could flatten a field that fast.

After breakfast Chris announces their next challenge and to meet him at the campfire grounds. Once arrived Chris announces their next challenge he dubs “The Champions Journey” (I don’t think I labeled the other three which were “Towers of Triumph” “Soaring High” and “The Feast of Champions” I think you can see the theme by now.) Each team must find wooden heads of every past Total Drama contestant from every season and stack them in the correct order to create season-based totems. He explains the challenge is an extended version of the Tri-Armed Triathlon final challenge. Wooden heads of every single character through the series is scattered across a massive playing field (including trees, mud pits, animal dens, and more.) Wrong placements trigger super soaker blasts from Chris, Chef, and Don. (Chris aims for maximum discomfort, Chef has brutal accuracy, and Don at least apologizes when he hits someone.) 

With explanations given Chris declares it’s a race to determine immunity and loserdom! He then blows the horn, signaling the start of the challenge.

Golden Giraffes appoint Heather, Courtney, Priya, and Damien as stackers. Damien has a photographic memory and can remember his seasons perfectly. Courtney has organization skills. Heather has experience, and Priya has studied all things Total Drama. This leaves Topher, Jacques, Mickey, and Dakota to search for the heads. The teams biggest weakness is the Ridonculous Race order as none of the four stackers watched it. The whole stack is trial and error, sometimes the water blasts them into the tower, making them start over. They also struggle with Revenge and Phakitew though not as much. The collectors aren’t notoriously fast or athletic either minus Jacques which also slows them down, they do possess all eight members and have an advantage.

Victorious Vipers have the least members and have to divide carefully. Gwen knows past seasons well and takes the lead as she was personally in half the seasons. Lauren says she’s great at remembering victims. Gwen likes horror and doesn’t mind Lauren at all. Kitty also pitches in as she admits Total Drama was a guilty pleasure of hers to watch. This means it’s up to the guys to get the heads. Wayne shows his surprising leadership skills for the guy team. Mike stays in control but does channel Manitoba mid-challenge to track where heads are hidden. Wayne starts throwing heads football-style, towards a set pile by the girls. Mickey is the slowest but he’s determined, eventually he comes up with another idea, organizing the heads by what season they appeared in.

Fierce Ferrets have Emma trying to take charge with her organization skills, but more aggressive team members refuse to listen. Josee says she remembers the necks she stepped on in her season fondly. DJ offers to pitch in for coverage on older seasons. Axel focuses on retrieving heads and does so alone. She’s a skilled tracker. Josee struggles to put other teams above her own head, getting her soaked till Emma grabs the heads from her. DJ hesitates on certain placements after being soaked a couple times. Scott sneaks off to “sabotage” other teams. In a confessional he asks Dawn to forgive him. His strategy is to take unguarded collected heads from other teams. Chase was so focused on himself he genuinely doesn’t remember his own elimination order. Axel has to reluctantly help him. Amy laughs at him before she has to help pitch in for her own season of totems. Scott is eventually caught and Courtney literally buries him halfway, effectively removing him from the challenge. 

Based on all skills presented it is the Vipers that come out on top again! Gwen, Lauren, and Kitty have coverage over 7 of the 9 seasons AND Kitty took photos on her phone of her time in the race, she gets the entirety of her season correct. Mickey’s organization speeds up the process while Mike and Wayne’s athletics gather heads at a solid pace even with less people.

The Giraffe’s take second. Courtney, Heather, Damien, and Priya have a rock solid six seasons and Priya can pick up the slack on two others but they would immensely struggle with Ridonculous Race. Their head hunters though are a bigger weak point. With Jacques being their only athletic member, essentially they have very high highs and very low lows.

The Ferrets lose this challenge. Emma and Josee cover RR and DJ covers older seasons, but he wasn’t in All-Stars. They only cover four seasons and desperately pull away head hunters to help with their other coverages, but in turn slowed down finding heads. It didn’t help that most of what Emma said was ignored by most of the team. Or that Scott was literally kidnapped by the Giraffes though stealing some of their heads did slow the Giraffes down, his plan COULD have worked. All and all the Ferrets just couldn’t keep it together and must return to elimination and add someone else’s head to the pile. Whose head will roll? You decide!

1jrlwso,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jrlwso/a_megalist_of_everyday_items_to_use_as_stims/,A megalist of everyday items to use as stims,"This is a list of every day objects that can be used as stims. Intended for people who can't afford/access dedicated fidget toys, or don't want to come out as autistic in public. 

**Visual stims:**

* Mystic quartz: Quartz treated with a surface coating that gives it an iridescent or kaleidoscopic rainbow effect. Because it's based on regular quartz the gems are pretty cheap.

* Fluorite crystals: They look like an aurora or rainbow storm cloud trapped in glass. Very pretty. Colors vary so I recommend buying in person or buying induvial crystals on Ebay so you can pick one that you like.

* Fractal art, optical illusions, MC Escher paintings: Visually stimulating art that you can hang as a regular painting. 

* Dichroic prisms: A dichroic coating is designed to block all but a narrow range of colors. It looks really pretty on a prism. 

* Suncatcher crystals: Trippy kaleidoscope prisms.

* Iridescent film or crystals: Iridescent materials change color depending on the angle of light hitting it. They can be quite pretty.

* UV reactive stuff: You can buy all kinds of items designed to glow under UV light. Combined with some UV LEDs or a blacklight flashlight you can create some trippy effects. Google ""trip cave"" for inspiration. Just don't look directly at a blacklight.

* Aurora lights: Shines a rainbow pattern on the ceiling. 

* Glow in the dark stars: Small dots or stars that can be glued onto the ceiling, creating a sort of night sky in your bedroom. They come in multiple colors.

---

**Auditory stims:**

* Bubble wrap: Satisfying when popped. Can be found for free in packaging or for very cheap at office supply stores.

* Silicone popping toy: Similar to bubble wrap but reusable.

* Rainsticks: A hollow branch filled with beads. Flipping it around causes the beads fall and bounce around, creating a calming rain-like sound.

* Music: If you find yourself listening to music to recover from stressful situations, you're probably using it as a stim and not just as music.

* Other audio: Stimming to digital audio doesn't necessarily have to mean music. It could also be ASMR, sound effects, relaxing soundscapes, video game sounds, etc.

* Mini waterfall: A tiny waterfall to sit on your desk and create a calm water trickling sound.

---

**Olfactory stims:**

* Candles, essential oils, perfumes, scented soaps, bath bombs, body sprays, etc: Easy to find in most supermarkets. Come in a million scents. 

* Coffee beans and tea: Also cheap and easy to find. You can smell the right out of the bag, brewing is optional. Coffee beans don't reset nose blindness by the way, that's a myth.

* Cedar wood chips: Meant for smoking meats. Can be purchased in hardware stores. They smell nice when warmed.

* Vick's vaporub, Carmex, lemon scented alcohol wipes: All three have a simple but strong smell and are cheap at stores.

* Vanilla extract: You probably already own some. Give the alcohol a moment to evaporate before smelling it. Also comes in flavors like peppermint, banana and almond. 

* Laundry detergent: If you find a detergent you like the smell of, your clothes become a stim.

* Real plants: Potted plants, sticks from outside, live moss and live herbs can be had for cheap or even free. 

* Aromatherapy necklaces: These house a small vial of essential oils that get slowly released throughout the day. 

---

**Texture stims:**

* Cloth bags of beads: If you have a cloth/silk dice bag, fill it with smooth items like beads, marbles and dice. Feel them through the fabric. 

* Textured glass: Sometimes I find plates, bottles, or other glass items with interesting textures. Smooth bumps and ridges for example. 

* Faux silk/fur: It can be very soft. If you have a coat or gloves with faux fur you can stroke it in public fairly discreetly. 

* Paint brushes and feathers: Being brushed by soft bristles can be quite pleasurable. If you use real feathers make sure they're clean. 

* Memory foam: *squish squish*. You can buy memory foam animals or just rip a hunk out of an old pillow. 

* Squishmallows: Squishable adorable stuffed animals. 

* Acupressure rings: Spiky rings that can be rolled over the fingers.

* Fabric: Silk, fleece, ribbon, faux fur and microfiber all have interesting textures.

* Putty/slime: Silly putty, slime, putty eraser, nonnewtonian fluid, therapy putty, glue, bread dough, ferrofluid, etc.

---

**Oral stims:**

* Miswak sticks: Dried stem of a plant that's very tough and fibrous. When chewed it frays into bristles that naturally clean your teeth. Some reviews say it has a strong smell.

* Sugarcane sticks (in moderation): Similar to miswak sticks but made of sugar and therefor delicious. This should be a treat instead since it's literally made of sugar.

* Licorice root (in moderation): Licorice root can be purchased from some specialty health stores or for tea. It's like chewing on a very flavorful stick, more waxy and less crumbly than cinnamon. In high doses it can cause high blood pressure, so don't chew on it every day.

* Himalayan hard cheese: Typically given to dogs as a chew toy, but they make versions for humans too. [Adam Ragusea has a recipe here if you want to make your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvucazJ0kA).

* Biltong, pemmican, snapstix: All three are extremely tough meat jerky that take a long time to chew through.

* Frozen or dehydrated Twizzlers: When they're dry or cold they get very tough.

* Mastic gum: A tough and chewy gum that is generally marketed as a workout for the jaw.

* Teething biscuits: Very dense biscuits meant for helping babies with teething issues. Can be purchased from most stores or made from scratch. Frozen bagels are similar.

---

**Pressure stims:**

* Weighted blankets: Like being laid on by a heavy cloud.

* Massage hook: A ball on a curved hook used to massage your back muscles.

* Massages: Involves spending money and being around people, but nothing beats a good massage.

* Compression socks: A gentle hug for your feet.

1jrlshi,https://v.redd.it/rlwmen0pjvse1,"I know Atrioc is furious about coffee prices soaring due to tariffs, but I wish the coffee cow could clarify some things about Trump's aim.","So, I have watched a few videos about the topic in which some commentators entertain the idea that Trump might want a new mar-a-lago accord to reduce the dollar's value without weakening its position as the global currency (this is my summary, not sure if I get it right). 

My understanding is that tariffs on China do not work because China will use Mexico to export their goods to the U.S., avoiding said tariffs. The problem also is that the dollar is so sought-after that countries usually want to export more to the US than import to get some dollars into their reserves (?). That has shrinken the U.S. economy but not its position in the world. As a byproduct, it also has drastically reduced America's manufacturer power in comparison to other countries, which in turn can be problematic for war. In other words, in the U.S. there are not many factories that can be used for Tank production in the case of, e.g., Taiwan being threatened by China. But in the end, the worst byproduct is the dissapearence of the middle class in the U.S., and I think that this is quite supported by the several times that Big A has spoken about a K-shaped economy in the U.S. I think that this Jon Stewart enterview explains it better than I do if anyones wants to watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgEQeLR-M0g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgEQeLR-M0g)

I don't understand much about this, yet when I found this Jim Cramer quote, a.k.a. Atrioc's idol, I was a bit baffled. After all, it feels almost natural that countries get richer when they trade, but I did not know that globalization and the current world order was a delibarated construction. In my mind, making money and free trade were almost natural, but the way we trade seems to not be so. 

I don't get how does globalization and the value of the dollar as well as it being the global currency produced inequality. If people in the US are paid in dollars and get cheap goods, shouldn't they be living better off than the rest of the world? Also, the US seems to spend tons of money for being the police of the whole world. Could it be that such spending is the reason why Europeans have a higher standard of life than Americans? Europe doesn't have to take care of that, and that would be the reason why J.D. Vance often says that they are free-loading America. Could all of this make sense of Trump's aggresive tariff approach? I mean, I do not approve of the methods, but I understand the idea behind. And it also makes me wary of some people who say that what anything he does is simply stupid because I think that this is at least an attempt to tackle inequalities in America. I hope Big A can answer to this post :) I am not an economist, and recently became interested in this stuff, so if anyone answers, please be gentle hahaaha",0,1743798415.0,atrioc,11,0.41,False

Bring manufacturing back. Boost American jobs. Make more stuff here, not there.

But I have a simple, honest question: where are the workers supposed to come from?

Unemployment is the lowest it’s been in decades. Everywhere I look, companies are already struggling to hire—whether it’s factories, warehouses, or even local coffee shops. Help Wanted signs are up, shifts are short, and it’s not for lack of trying. So if we’re suddenly going to build more here at home, who’s going to do all that building?

This isn’t a policy critique—it’s a real concern. If tariffs make imports more expensive and encourage U.S. companies to manufacture domestically, that’s fine. But you can’t just flip a switch and expect an army of workers to appear out of nowhere. We’re already at “full employment.” The math just doesn’t add up.

And it’s not just about any workers—it’s about skilled labor. Welding, machining, robotics, production lines—these jobs require training. They take time to ramp up. Meanwhile, we’re not exactly flooding the system with technical education or immigration reform to help close the gap.

So I guess I’m not trying to be critical, I’m just asking what a lot of people are quietly thinking: if we’re going to bring the jobs back—great. But who’s going to fill them?

Because right now, it feels like no one’s really answering that. And it matters. A lot.",4,1743798266.0,economy,5,1.0,False

I’ve posted a few of my other designs for feedback and have really appreciated the constructive criticism I’ve gotten so far. So I’m back at it again asking for more. 

To give context: each of these are fictional brands found through logo challenges or just made up in my head.

Prompt for Oakao: the challenge was to create a logo for a clothing company called Oakao. You’ve probably seen this from the Daily Logo Challenge. There was no specifics on what kind of clothing the brand sold so I went with a swimwear/beachwear concept since I was living in Hawaii at the time. I wanted something that was cool and casual but gave off a well made product vibe. Something you’d see on the Waikiki strip. I wanted colors that were reminiscent of sunset on the water.

Northbound: so obviously a different type of outdoor vibe. More mountains and hiking and less beaches. For the logo mark I wanted it to call back to 2 things,a mountain and shadow, and the track mark of a hiking boot. The negative space making both the letter N but also could be seen as a trail going up the mountain. Not 100% in love with the word mark fonts so that may need to be worked on. 

The Java Lamp: literally an idea for a company I came up with while working late at night lol Was thinking of a cup of coffee and said what can I do with this so here we go. Just wanted something fun and retro. The logo mark is obviously a coffee mug but I hope my incorporation of the lava lamp esq bubbles kind of takes some of the cliche out of it. Or maybe it adds to it idk. The font for Java was handmade taking the shapes used from the lava bubbles in the mug.

============

# 🌿 What Is Blood Sugar Blaster?

**Blood Sugar Blaster** is a daily formula packed with **20 natural ingredients**, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs known for **blood sugar support**.

It’s marketed as a **natural blood sugar supplement inspired by ancient medicine**, and the pitch includes a tale about a **Hindu manuscript cure for diabetes**.

While the story leans a bit Indiana Jones, it’s the blend that matters: **botanicals**, **minerals**, and **antioxidants** that aim to support glucose levels *without medication*.

The creators say it helps improve **insulin sensitivity**, supports **pancreas health**, and may reduce post-meal crashes—all in capsule form.

It's also one of the few **blood sugar supplements with 20 natural ingredients**, made in a certified US facility and stamped non-GMO and gluten-free.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients & Their Purpose

Each capsule includes a mix of ingredients selected for their effect on **how to balance blood sugar naturally** and reduce glucose-related fatigue.

**Cinnamon for blood sugar control** gets the spotlight, thanks to research suggesting it may help mimic insulin. It’s in good company here.

**Bitter melon**—yes, it tastes like sadness, but research says it can [lower sugar levels](https://theworldhealth.org/blood-sugar-blaster-official). So if you’ve ever wondered, **does bitter melon lower blood sugar?** Apparently, yes.

**Gymnema sylvestre**, **banaba leaf**, and **white mulberry** also feature, giving you a buffet of **herbs that stabilize blood sugar levels** without synthetic extras.

**Chromium and vanadium for glucose control** get bonus points for being minerals people with diabetes often lack.

The formula also includes **biotin**, **alpha-lipoic acid**, and **magnesium**, often listed among **vitamins that help regulate glucose**.

If you're eyeing **supplements for type 2 diabetes support**, this stack covers the basics and goes a bit further.

# 🌿 What Users Are Really Saying

Most folks trying this aren't expecting miracles. They want fewer mood crashes, better energy, and something that feels like a **safe supplement for diabetic patients**.

A handful say they finally stopped chasing the 3 PM cookie. Others claim it helped reduce **insulin resistance naturally**, though your results may vary.

One guy swore he hadn’t felt this balanced since the early '90s—back when his knees still worked properly and his sugar levels didn’t do the cha-cha.

Some users weren’t blown away. They expected faster results, but that's supplements for you—not a lightswitch. But most were into the whole **holistic treatment for high blood sugar** vibe.

# 🌿 Personal Experience (from Bill, My Uncle’s Fishing Buddy)

Bill’s been my uncle’s fishing partner for years—the kind of guy who brings his own thermos of black coffee, refuses sunscreen, and can clean a trout with one hand while arguing about baseball with the other.

He’s in his late 60s now, and a few months back, he started grumbling about his “numbers being all over the place”—meaning his blood sugar.

Apparently, his doctor had started dropping the dreaded prediabetes warnings, and Bill wasn’t thrilled about the idea of prescriptions. “I’m not ready for the pharmacy parade,” he told my uncle one morning, halfway through baiting a hook.

So he started poking around online for **natural blood sugar support** and ended up [giving Blood Sugar Blaster a whirl](https://theworldhealth.org/blood-sugar-blaster-official).

Now, Bill’s not the type to get excited about supplements, but after a couple of weeks he said he felt “less rattled.” No more post-lunch slumps.

No more cranky lows after skipping a snack. He even mentioned his wife noticed he was sleeping better, which, in Bill’s words, “means I stopped snoring like a lawnmower.”

He did mention one small annoyance—the pills were bigger than expected. He takes them with orange juice now, which seems to help. “I wouldn’t call it magic,” he told my uncle, “but I don’t feel like I’m riding a sugar seesaw anymore.”

That’s high praise from Bill. If it’s good enough to keep him sharp on fishing days, it’s worth paying attention to.

# 🌿 Pros

🟢 **Full of nature-backed ingredients** you’ve actually heard of—no random bark from obscure Himalayan trees.  
🟢 **Supports more than blood sugar**, helping with energy, sleep, and stress control too.  
🟢 Appeals to people looking for **natural insulin support supplements** rather than chemical solutions.  
🟢 Manufactured under strict standards, earning it points as one of the more **doctor-approved blood sugar supplements**.

1jrlhdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jrlhdb/enteric_zoster_gut_specific_internal_shingles/,Enteric Zoster - Gut Specific Internal Shingles,"Quick personal history - I’ve been battling with IBS for decades and also have a history of a shingles infection in my early twenties. I’ve since had a recurrence of shingles symptoms off and on for years. Just recently I experienced a major recurrence in which I had severe nerve pain across my entire torso area. Odd part is there was no appearance of the traditional rash, just the familiar nerve pain directly under the skin and the fever, aches and malaise. Here’s the super weird and partly gross part. My IBS has caused me to have continued diarrhea where I could literally eat a totally benign food item and be on the toilet 5 minutes later. With that said, leading up to my intense shingles recurrence, my BMs have been unbelievably normalized and solid the likes of which I haven’t experienced since I was like 12. No diet change, and new meds, just boom the change. Now that my recurrence is full blown still the same consistency of BMs. And here’s the real kicker…my body used to freak out hardcore when I’d have barely a sip of coffee, and I love coffee. Once my BMs regulated but I felt like crap I thought well what the hell I might as well have a little coffee and see if anything has changed. Welp, turns out my body can now process coffee without issue. I’d be interested to hear what you guys think. My layman’s wild guess is I’ve had shingles on my gut for years and now it finally moved from my gut to other parts of my body 🤷‍♂️",1,1743797622.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1jrlfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1jrlfq4/why/,WHY....,"As a trans woman who lives her life full time in this god forsaken world. Why do some people see us as either mentally ill men dressed up as women or monsters? Men see me as a sex object to be thrown away after they are done. Some women look down on me as some sort of monster to hurt them, I am not that, if anything I want their help to understand what I need to do to help all of us. Why do politicians demonize trans women, most if not all of us just want to live our lives. We never wanted to be a political pawn. Ten years ago most of the general public had never heard of transgender people and now it's all that politician talk about. WHY?

I have been dealing with how I feel for my entire life. Growing up looking in the mirror and seeing my beard start growing as a teenager and my face becoming more and more masculine was a absolute hell to deal with. I had a father that never listened to me and just told me to ""grow up and be a man"", that was the last thing in my mind I wanted to do. So for years and years I did what society expected me to do, play sports, join the military, get married and have a family. Guess what, none of that made me feel any better. I still hated who I was on the outside, I hated the refection in the mirror.

For decades I have dealt with thoughts of ending everything but I have always stopped because I had a family and later I had a son and I didn't want to hurt him. It wasn't till I was 48 and I was sitting in my room looking down a barrel of a gun that I finally gained enough strength to reach out for help. I searched and found a therapist and psychologist to help me understand why I felt the way I did. After a long time of speaking with them, they came to the conclusion that I was suffering with gender dysphoria. My therapist brought me to her office one day. In her office is a large coffee table. On this day the table was covered in all of her notes from my sessions with her. She asked me to start reading all the notes on the table, so I did. It took me awhile to read all the notes. Once I had finished reading I sat back in the chair I was sitting in. She looked at me and said one thing to me "" What do you see in all the notes?"" I sat there for a few minutes and I said ""I'm a woman."" and started to cry. She consoled me and said that over the last couple months that she had come to the same conclusion and had to find a way for me to see it for myself without someone directly telling me who I was. I told myself in that office, on that day, who I really was.

So to all the men out there who look at trans women as simply object for you to use, I find it to be disgusting. I am a human being who has had to come to terms with who they are at their core. Give us the respect that we deserve. I don't understand why you feel that way and probably never will.

To all the women, who see trans women as some monster coming to hurt you. That is the last thing I want to do. I want to help and be helped. I never was allowed to grow up as little girl with a mother to show me and help me with everything. I'm having to figure everything out on my own. I do have some female friends who have helped over the years and I will be forever grateful to them.

To the politicians that are here, I know you are here I've seen a few of you. Why did you decide to turn the spotlight onto such a small part of the the population? We are less than 1.5% of the population of the United States. We never did anything to hurt anyone. Yet there are hyperbolic stories made about us. Someone like me who has been on HRT for years has no advantage in sports whatsoever, if anything we are at a disadvantage in sport due to the loss of muscle mass. Did you simply do do this for political votes? There are so many different things that could have been your focus instead of us.

In the end I will probably never know WHY people hate and fear trans people. We are simply people born differently than everyone else. We never asked to be this way. We had to take steps to help ourselves, so we could simply survive. If you lack the empathy to understand this I feel sorry for you.

So as a final thought here for you is this, WHY DO YOU FEEL THE WAY YO DO TOWARDS TRANS PEOPLE? Please take a had long look as to the reason why",21,1743797506.0,TransLater,5,0.89,False
