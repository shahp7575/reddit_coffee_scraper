(To Monk) Captain Stottlemeyer: You know what I'm gonna do? First thing in the morning, I'm gonna call the Vatican and I'm gonna nominate your late wife Trudy for sainthood! Because you are impossible!

Dr. Kroger: Wait, why the drug stores?  
Captain Stottlemeyer: I figure he's gonna have to buy wipes sooner or later.

Karen Stottlemeyer: Is that coffee?  
Captain Stottlemeyer: Yes. Yes, it is. It's a coffeefall.

Captain Stottlemeyer: Maybe she needs some time off.  
Adrian Monk: From what?  
Captain Stottlemeyer: From you. Monk, that lady's got the most stressful job in North America. I know guys on the bomb squad, tough as nails, nerves of steel, that couldn't work for you. They'd have cracked four years ago. I'd say give her a break. A week off with pay. Send her home. There, case closed.

Captain Stottlemeyer: Okay. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm setting the alarm to 8:00. Eight-oh-oh. Are you happy  
Adrian Monk: Yeah.  
Captain Stottlemeyer: Now, I'm setting the clock ahead seven minutes, so really, I'll be getting up at 7:53. Now we're both happy.  
Adrian Monk: Yeah, but...  
Captain Stottlemeyer: You come in here again, Monk, and I'll shoot ya.

Captain Stottlemeyer: They call it a panic room. I know that's a difficult concept, because for you, every room is a panic room.

Captain Stottlemeyer: Let's see, Barbara. ""I am into yoga, pilates, getting in touch with my spirituality..."" Been there, married that.

Lieutenant Disher: Your wife's here.  
Captain Stottlemeyer: Okay. Okay. Uh, look, I need a few minutes. Could you stall her?  
Lieutenant Disher: What should I do?  
Captain Stottlemeyer: Uh, talk to her.  
Lieutenant Disher: About what? I mean, what does she like to talk about?  
Captain Stottlemeyer: How I ruined her life.

I'm feeling really affirmed and happy right now. I want to remind you all that you are not alone in your queer faith journey.

The latest was a dermatologist finding a dysplastic mole on my throat. I was referred a plastic surgeon and they scheduled me this morning to cut a 2x2cm chunk from my throat/neck/collarbone area. 

I normally take my son to school every morning, and pick him up in the afternoon, and I also run a business. We don't have much help so my wife stays at home with our 2mo and I basically pull duty on our son. We elected to keep him home today just for logistics. My wife insisted on going with me because well, they're taking a chunk out of my neck. We have no help, I reasoned with her that no one was there to watch the kids, so I will just go it alone. She was on the verge of tears. I told her ""I'll be fine."" 

I was planning to head to work first, then to surgery. Our 2.5yo had a meltdown this morning which delayed things. Cooked the family breakfast and made it out the door super late. My wife was almost in tears again as I left. I grabbed a quick protein shake and a coffee. 

Called my staff on the way and told them I was just going right to surgery. 

They gowned me up, I sat and watched Netflix for about an hour, before they brought me back. On the way the nurse asked who was driving me and I said ""myself..."" She looked at the paper and said ""Yeah I mean, it's only a local...but well...OK that's fine."" I started kinda feeling a little bad for myself and then it hit me: Suck it up. You got 2 little ones at home with mom. You're dad. You're not a wimp. Be the example you want for them. I put my chin up. I remember having to be with my son prior to his surgery and actually thanked God it was me this time, not him, my daughter, or my wife. 

Marched on into the OR with my ass feeling the breeze from the open gown. 

Doc was super cool, surgical assistant was as well. They joked they had never seen someone so calm on the table for a local only surgery. My heart rate was 61. I joked and said ""Well, I am actually getting a chance to rest now, so..."" They asked me what I was doing after and I said ""I have to go to work."" Doc even said ""Damn man, why don't you take a day off?"" I said ""I can't."" Then we chatted on about what I do, his feelings about his FA, etc. The only weird part was when they started to cut and I felt the blood running down my neck. I actually joked ""Don't mess my hair up!"" and they all laughed because I'm bald.

Had to throw a dad joke in there somewhere. 

It was over, I threw on my clothes, and I'm now typing this as I finish a late lunch at work. Wife called me, asked how I was doing, I said ""Great. Never better."" 

The derm is eyeing one up on my face next, so at least this was a nice trial run. 

Being a dad is tough, and some of you guys are true heroes. Keep those chins up guys. There's a cold beer waiting for us all at the end of one of these days.

1gc31k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1gc31k8/six_cardinal_scents_reviews/,six cardinal scents reviews,"I‚Äôm pretty new to indie fragrances, and **Cardinal Scents** is one of the first houses I‚Äôve placed orders with. I was really curious about some of their scents, especially when they posted about their fall collection in this sub. Unfortunately for my wallet, I‚Äôm hooked! I‚Äôve tried 6 of their scents so far and hope to try a few more soon. Here are my reviews:

**Pillow Fort** (*lavender sugar, clean cotton, amber, white musk*) - fancy lavender laundry detergent! And a bit soapy. I really have to use a light hand applying this because even the tiniest bit really projects. This makes me feel like I have my life together and get my laundry washed, dried and folded in a timely manner (which I do *not* IRL lol). I was hoping this would be a good sleep scent with the lavender and sheets, but it inspires productivity rather than sleepiness. Lavender and cotton are the dominant notes here.

**Familiar Spirit** (*milk, white sage, sea salt, white amber*) - LOVE LOVE LOVE this. Possibly found my signature scent, y‚Äôall. The most ethereal, creamy & salty amber. What I imagine the ‚Äúclean girl‚Äù aesthetic would smell like personified. It‚Äôs feminine and cozy and something about it makes me feel so relaxed and calm. One of my favorite non-indies is Xtra Milk (milk, amber, bergamot) from Dedcool & I‚Äôve been layering this with their body wash in that scent. SO good. I‚Äôm full-sizing this my next order. I want to bathe in this daily. If Cardinal Scents had one of those vinyl car wraps for advertising, I‚Äôd ride around with a Familiar Spirit version. Amazing.

**Ink Blot** (*amber, vanilla, cedar, bergamot*) - this starts out smelling just like the vanilla Tootsie Rolls in the blue wrapper! I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it for a moment, but that‚Äôs exactly what the smell is. Kind of has a powdery quality that reminds me of how Smarties smell slightly powdery (does anyone else think this haha?). The cedar turns this a little masculine at times. A little sexy, too! Overall I think it‚Äôs nice, but it has a sort of fuzzy quality to my nose that I wish was smoothed out.

**Lunar Conspiracy** (*pink pepper, white peony, grey amber, jack pine*)- has a strong pine opening, but quickly falls in line with the rest of the notes. To me this is very clean & almost invigorating; would be a great ‚Äúwake up!‚Äù scent if you‚Äôre feeling groggy or sluggish in the morning. It kind of leans into cologne territory to me - very unisex! The pink pepper adds a fresh, bright element. Unfortunately this barely lasts on me, and I‚Äôm desperate to figure out how to amplify the scent because I really do like it!

**Morning Paper** (*fresh brewed coffee, palo santo, newsprint, sandalwood*) - bready, nutty coffee. This is actually a pretty realistic roasted coffee scent; like, the actual *process* of roasting coffee beans. I bought my husband a little coffee roaster for Christmas a few years back and this smells just like when he‚Äôd roast a batch; there‚Äôs very little ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù smell, it‚Äôs a very dry, nutty, bread-like aroma. You might be familiar if you have a cafe near you that roasts their own beans. Not really what I expected - not bad, but my least favorite of the bunch. I think I want to try buying and layering a single coffee note with it to bring it closer to what I expected/wanted.

**Night Owl** (*night blooming jasmine, wet ivy, bergamot, rainswept pavement*) - probably my second favorite of the bunch. I think this is the first jasmine I‚Äôve tried that isn‚Äôt stinky, heady and/or turns rotten on me. It‚Äôs a soaked, sopping-wet, green jasmine and I really think the other notes are doing a fantastic job keeping it fresh. This was my ‚Äúout of my comfort zone‚Äù purchase from them since I‚Äôd never tried any rain/wet notes, and the risk paid off!

Overall, I‚Äôm really impressed with Cardinal Scents and I‚Äôll be keeping most of these scents in my regular rotation. I have my eye on Sand Castle, Kitchen Table, and Gentle Reader next! I‚Äôll absolutely be keeping my eyes peeled for any new releases, as well üëÄ No pressure at all to the lovely owner, but I‚Äôm crossing my fingers for a Christmas release because I think they‚Äôd nail it! Excellent scents all around.

Here‚Äôs a space to share advice, ask questions, or just talk about your experiences with dating in this lifestyle.

Here are some tips to get the conversation started:

* **Communication is Key**: Whether you‚Äôre in a relationship or single, clear and open communication about boundaries, interests, and comfort levels is essential.
* **Find the Right Platforms**: Not all dating sites are created equal for the lifestyle crowd. Sites like SDC, Kasidie, or even specific Reddit communities (üòâ) can be great spots to connect with other swingers.
* **Respect and Consent**: Always ask first and respect each person‚Äôs boundaries. It‚Äôs all about creating a safe and fun environment for everyone!
* **Plan the First Meetup Carefully**: When meeting new people, choose a neutral and comfortable setting, like a lounge or coffee shop. It makes it easier to feel out the vibe and see if there‚Äôs a mutual connection.
* **Enjoy the Adventure**: Swingers dating can be an exciting journey, but remember to take things at your own pace. There‚Äôs no rush, and it‚Äôs all about having fun and connecting with great people.

[https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/2014/06/21/art-of-stone-prevention/](https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/2014/06/21/art-of-stone-prevention/)

I had a similar experience.  For my whole life, I've always had trouble with bladder strength.  If I drink water it goes right through me.  If I have coffee, even worse.  So when I had to stand watches (6 hours) in the Navy, or had to make long drives (2 hours) later on in life, I would deliberately withhold fluids - putting myself into dehydration.  And to make matters worse - like the OR nurse in the story above - I would snack on nuts and other salty foods.  The results were what you'd expect:  kidney stones.  LOTS of kidney stones.  I stopped keeping track at one point, but it was well over 2 dozen.

The moral of the story is that preventing stones is fairly straightforward:  stay hydrated, pee often (and make arrangements when your professional life makes that a challenge) and stay aware of what you're eating (e.g., watch your oxalates if you're a CaOx stone former like many of us).

(It will be at bottom of this post) I'd also like for you to share experiences and opinions on which you prefer, how they compare, etc. Today I realized weirdly enough chewing tobacco reigns supreme for me.","I've had phases using pretty much every type/ROA of nic besides the nose candy snuff those wild Swedes use. 


I have smoked 20+ types of cigs and cigarillos on and off for years including Indonesian kretek cigs (my absolute favorite smokeable) and dabbled with cigars and hookah. 
    
‚Ä¢ My takeaway on this group is that cigs are probably the most practical daily choice for obvious reasons, but this group in general is the absolute worst for your health in the long term. I use them sparingly and personally can't smoke more than 2 a day or for several days in a row without feeling noticable decline in my overall wellbeing coupled with nausea. I do smoke some of the strongest available on the US market so that is likely a contributing factor, but anything lighter lacks the taste I'm looking for. 
  
‚Ä¢ Side rant: It really sucks that there's really only one cig available with a charcoal filter in this market when research has shown that countries that primarily use them have lower smoking-related diseases and death despite higher rates of usage in their populations. (NOT advocating for this as a healthier alternative, but as harm reduction) Also, bring back clove cigs and give us those flavor filter balls they have in Asia! Imagine a vanilla espresso clove cig!


For sublingual tobacco I've done snus pouches, snuff/dip (worst ROA of all imo), and chew (favorite ROA of all). 
  
‚Ä¢ Some American snus is ok but always leaves me feeling underwhelmed in terms of satiation‚Äî and I'm not a fan of the added sugars. The Swedish market has a much wider variation in flavor and strength but is expensive to import so it's more of a novelty for me, and half of what I've tried has absolutely put me on my ass (not in a fun way). One nice anecdote about snus is that no studies have conclusively proven that its use has correlation with mouth disease. I don't know who funded those studies and am not advocating for it as a healthier alternative to other forms of tobacco.
  
‚Ä¢ Wet snuff/dip is just disgusting to me. The coffee grounds-like texture and overbearing flavor additives are a sensory nightmare. I get that long-cut mitigates the texture issue but I never fail to have little flakes migrating to the back of my throat causing discomfort.
  
‚Ä¢ Today I picked up Levi Garrett chew again because I was feeling nostalgic of times when I would chew with my grandfather in his pickup truck, and man, what a great experience! It's sweet but not overbearingly so, while being herbaceous and complex‚Äî kind of like a horehound candy or some herbal teas. I feel very focused and calm, on my second plug and no nausea or anxiety! It has the effects cigs were sold to me on that I never actually experienced.
 

I'll just lump all non tobacco nic here. I've vaped freebase and salt nic in disposables, pod pens, and box mods. I did the salt nic pouches for a while and have only really used gum as a stopgap if I was really jonesing. (which is the only use it has for me, pouches are just superior imo)
   
‚Ä¢ I'm not a fan of freebase, it just never scratched the itch for me. 
 
‚Ä¢ Disposables, while having the best tasting juice, are terrible for the environment but great for me because I take all the used ones from my friends and use the batteries in electronics builds/projects.
  
‚Ä¢ I use a pen style pod vape with salt nic daily and it gets the job done nicely. It has a solid tight hit like a cig and I use juices that are about as close as you can get to disposables. There is still the environmental impact of the plastic pods but it's nowhere near as egregious as being responsible  for throwing a lithium battery into a landfill every week.

‚Ä¢ Box mods seem like something I'd be into in theory but have never appealed to me. I love building and tinkering with many things, but I look at my vape like my beater daily driver and don't want to put the time and money into a box mod.
  
‚Ä¢ Nic pouches to me are probably the most practical way to go for nicotine consumption. Anytime, anywhere, just pop that baby in. No tobacco, no spitting after you adjust to the burn, and if there are paper cans and cotton pouches we're at peak eco friendly nic consumption. 


Now for the biggest personal drawback to nic pouches and all tobacco-less nic for me, and the precursor to the big question I have for everyone here: **the anxiety they induce!** Every form makes me feel so anxious at a certain level, and everything below that just does not satisfy.

Has anyone else experienced this that has tried most ROAs? Smoked tobacco can certainly induce nausea for me, but never anxiety. Sublingual tobacco is just a chill, focused experience‚Äî and I have yet to find a ceiling for nausea for chew specifically. Is this a matter of synthetic vs natural nicotine? Are there alkaloids or some other natural chemical in the plant that balance out anxiety derived from nic?

- When the donuts are out the oven, lightly spray them with some water and sprinkle the cinnamon mixture on top.
Best served immediately or keep in the fridge for 2-3 days.Ôªø

I skipped the cinnamon and sugar topping and I used some cream cheese, confectioners sugar substitute, cinnamon, vanilla and a bit of almond milk for an icing. Sometimes I‚Äôll add a bit of crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch for some crunch and to be fancy.

Per donut: Cals: 63, C: 8.9g, P: 6g, F: 0.3g (recipe makes 6 donuts)

Soooo, you could eat all 6 and still remain in your deficit. 378 calories total. I usually eat 3 and save the other 3 for the next day. For the next day, I like throwing them in my mini dash waffle maker and heat them up that way. I then like to make a blueberry/strawberry syrup and top them with that. Super yummy. I pair it with a protein iced coffee for added protein. Link to website posted below‚Ä¶

1gc2mxd,https://i.redd.it/pj37xxwkfywd1.jpeg,King's Table: UFC TOPURIA!! (308),"Click the image to see the ""Locks"" and updated rankings. A few things to note:

1. I just compile peoples picks, and calculate their pick rates. I go by their videos and posts, and if they make any changes after I post or if I missed it, I always go back and update it on my sheets. If anyone spots anything please point it out. I want my data to be as accurate as possible even when it shows that I'm the next to last ranked picker. 

2. The ""Locks"" are just unanimous (or -1) picks. They're not a betting suggestion, nor are they my personal locks hence the ""quotes"". Every event there's some lil roach just waiting to post that the locks were wrong. Statistically speaking though, fighters on the ""Locks"" column usually win. This small community you all have formed specifically for my tables is fucking amazing and mostly positive but GYAT DAYUM these mfs are annoying to read. It is what it is though. I'll never address this again. 

3. I read every comment, and every DM you all send me. If there's any way you feel I can improve my tables or add anything to it besides more people please let me know. I have a list of people I'll be adding soon. I'm hoping by this time next year, I have 30 predictors including a few AI models.

4. When I post, I'll be posting on my coffee page 1st, followed by X, Reddit, and then MAYBE IG. I don't know if I'm too damn old for IG but I hate that platform. There won't be any gaps between the posts besides the time it takes me to type out whatever I need to type out. Also the coffee posts are free. It's the platform I have to type the least on so I'll get the tables out faster, and I'll be honest hopefully I get some donos. However, I'll add this in caps, THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY. Seriously, they help a lot but the likes, upvotes, follows and shares is way more than enough. My current goal is to hit 500 follows on X by the end of the year and I'm 25 away. The engagement helps out so much.

Ok enough yapping or I'll sound like Nina. Good luck to all you and VAMOS ILIA!!!! üá™üá∏

1gc2i6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1gc2i6x/update_on_i_miss_my_kid_and_i_want_to_cry/,"UPDATE on ""I miss my kid and I want to cry""","I followed some of the advice on making sure Daughter wasn't putting too much pressure on herself, and yall were right. She kinda broke down and had a cry. Said she'd heard me and a couple of teachers saying we were proud of her, so she didn't want to let us down by ""doing less"". I've spent the last couple days helping her make a study schedule which allows her to do well in class while still having some free time. She's happy, her friends are happy, I'm happy. It's great.

I've volunteered to help at the elementary school 2 days per week. I do in fact have plenty of outside interests, but thought filling more of the time could be beneficial. And Daughter and I are starting a small crafting business together which fits her plans for some AP seminar thing she's looking at for college. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

We're now planning on having a snuggle-in night on Wednesdays where we watch Gilmore Girls and do our nails and have popcorn and cocoa and just relax. She's turned 2 of her study sessions in to studying with friends. And we made sure she had Friday nights off so that she can hang out with friends without books.

We had our first 2 snuggle-in nights this week, and she seemed so relaxed afterward. She did say she missed us just hanging out, and I said I did too. A lot of people had pointed out it was important that she know I miss her, and a lot of people had said it was important I not foist my feelings and doubts on her... I think this tiny interaction was the best of both. 

For those who offered these suggestions, thank you, they help a lot.

For those who empathized, don't worry, it can get better!

For those who needed to vent about your own negative experiences with homeschooling or with codependent parents: I'm very sorry that happened to you. I want you to understand that there is a difference between love and concern and closeness, and codependency. That it's normal to miss people you care about when you don't see them as often. And that this can and does often apply to parent-child relationships as well. I'm sorry that for many of you it did not. And I'm also truly sorry if my post brought up past trauma for you.

I've debated what to do about that initial post. I'm getting a ton of replies still, and lots of DMs (which I will not be responding to. Those of you with good intentions, I'm sorry, but there are too many which are ill-intentioned). I thought about deleting it, but many other parents are going through the same thing (and can use the love and support and advice). Or some sort of codependent thing (and can use the love and support and advice). So I've chosen to leave it up, and just take a reddit break until the comments die down a bit. I tried to edit in an update on that post, but it was too long, I guess... it kept not updating. 

I'm still a little sad and miss my kiddo a lot. But it's a lot more bearable knowing that she is happy and not feeling pressured or overwhelmed. I think seeing how exhausted she was comprised most of my problem. That was solved just by asking a coupke of questions, and that's how we got to the scheduling stuff.

If you're one of the people who are dealing with the same thing, here's how I did it, and maybe it will spark some ideas for you:

1) Over dinner, I said I'd been on reddit and tgat someone had shared a comment about how their kid had started AP classes and got overzealous and overwhelmed. Then I asked if she ever feels overwhelmed.

2) When she broke down, I said I was proud of her for being able to open up, and asked what she thought might help.

3) After we started working on her study schedule (her idea),  I asked what categories of things she'd like on her schedule... movie night, time with friends, etc. 

4) We made time for all of the stuff she mentioned, one of which was family time, and when we had finished the schedule we each wrote down a bunch of stuff we wanted to do for family time and shared our lists. We got lucky and they were actually pretty similar, or were things that could be combined.

5) She also asked if we could get extras of her Barron's AP study guides and I could help her study some of her AP stuff, so we're waiting for those to be delivered.

6) After each day I've asked her how the schedule felt and if she needs anything tweaked. 

7) We had a talk at a later (less emotionally charged) time about what she'd said about not wanting to disappoint people, so she'd know she can reach out if that happens again in the future.

8) We reimplemented the ""brain bucket"". It's an old coffee can we decorated and we can write random thoughts we have we want to share when the other isn't around. We did it when she was younger, and she thought it would help now. ""Some things are easier to write down than to say out loud."" We will go through it Saturday mornings and, if it works like it used to, it should bring up fun memories and important topics from throughout the week.

I will also say, reading all those replies was really emotional. And I want to reply to every one of you, but unfortunately I can't. I will read every single comment when I'm in a good emotional space to do so, and respond to as many as I can. If I don't reply, it is not personal. I appreciated *every* comment on the original thread, even the harsh ones. All PoVs help. 

Thank you all for caring enough about me and/or about my child to take the time to help, empathize, or even to chide me. ‚ô° ",7,1729884420.0,homeschool,2,0.89,False

I sat in the control room, staring blankly at the monitor. The sonar‚Äôs rhythmic pings filled the silence, but they felt hollow now, like the echo of something far more sinister. Emily and Dr. Miles sat beside me, neither saying a word. We had ascended hours ago, and the surface world should have brought a sense of safety. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we hadn‚Äôt left it behind. Not really.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, there was something down there,‚Äù I said, breaking the silence.¬†

Dr. Miles exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúWe know. We all saw it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe need to report this,‚Äù Emily chimed in, her voice hoarse from the strain of the dive. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äîit‚Äôs massive. And it‚Äôs watching us.‚Äù¬†

We sent our report to the expedition sponsors. As the lead scientist, I‚Äôd be the one to communicate directly with them, explain everything. I‚Äôd done it countless times before‚Äîrattling off findings, charting data, and impressing people with cold hard facts. But this was different.¬†

As I prepared the message, my thoughts drifted back to a time before this expedition‚Äîa time when my curiosity had been my only driving force. I had spent years studying marine life, seeking out the rarest, most elusive species, never imagining that one day I‚Äôd encounter something like this. Something I couldn‚Äôt quantify. ¬†¬†

My career had been marked by success, driven by my obsession with the unknown. But that same obsession had cost me, too. I‚Äôd lost friends, relationships‚Äîpeople who couldn‚Äôt understand why I would spend months at sea, chasing shadows in the water. They‚Äôd call me reckless. Some even called me a fool.¬†

But I‚Äôd never cared. Until now.¬†

¬†

The call came back, as clinical and dispassionate as I‚Äôd feared. A voice crackled over the comms, thick with bureaucratic detachment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received your report, Doctor. However, we urge you to proceed with the expedition. The funding for this mission is substantial, and we expect results.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúResults?‚Äù I repeated, incredulous. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about an unidentified creature, one that could pose a serious threat not just to us but to‚Äî‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe appreciate your concerns, but you‚Äôre there for research, not speculation. The deep ocean is an unexplored frontier, Doctor. Find what you can, document it, and return. We trust your team to handle the risks.‚Äù¬†

I glanced at Dr. Miles and Emily. They were listening in, waiting for the verdict. My heart sank as I muttered, ‚ÄúThey want us to continue.‚Äù¬†

Emily shook her head, frustration flickering across her face. ‚ÄúAre they insane? We barely made it back.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMoney talks,‚Äù Dr. Miles said bitterly, folding his arms. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care about the risks. Just the data.‚Äù¬†

I thought about pushing back, but what would be the point? The expedition was their investment. We were just tools, instruments to gather information they could use. And if that meant throwing us back into the depths with a creature we barely understood‚Äîso be it.¬†

¬†

We descended again the next day. The unease sat heavy in the air. This time, none of us spoke as we prepared the submersible, our movements robotic and grim. There was no sense of wonder now, no excitement about the unknown. Only dread.¬†

Emily initiated the descent, and the sub slipped beneath the waves, once again swallowed by the cold blackness of the deep ocean. The familiar hum of the engines was the only sound, and even that seemed muffled, as though the water itself was holding its breath.¬†

‚ÄúSonar‚Äôs clear,‚Äù Emily muttered. ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù¬†

We reached the depth where the whale skeleton had been discovered on the previous dive. But as we approached, something new came into view. Something that sent a shiver down my spine.¬†

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I whispered.¬†

Emily slowed the sub‚Äôs descent, and there it was‚Äîfloating in the abyss like a grotesque monument to death.¬†

A massive fish, its body stiff and contorted in death‚Äôs grip, drifted lifeless before us. Its bony frame was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen‚Äîlong, armored ridges along its back, rows of razor-sharp teeth protruding from its gaping maw. It was easily twice the size of a whale, and its eyes‚Äîthough lifeless‚Äîseemed to stare at us, wide and glassy.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is that?‚Äù Emily stammered.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a fish that large,‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his voice tight. ‚ÄúNothing documented even comes close.‚Äù¬†

The creature had been torn apart. Huge chunks of its flesh were missing, revealing bone and sinew. Jagged wounds, like something had bitten clean through it. My mind raced, trying to make sense of the scene, but one thought screamed louder than the others.¬†

Whatever did this was bigger. Much, much bigger.¬†

‚ÄúThis is fresh,‚Äù I murmured, my breath fogging the glass of the viewport. ‚ÄúIt just happened.‚Äù¬†

We stared at the mangled corpse in stunned silence, the implications sinking in. This thing hadn‚Äôt died of natural causes. It had been hunted, attacked.¬†

And we were in the territory of the hunter.¬†

¬†

The sonar pinged again, a single faint blip on the screen. My heart skipped a beat. It was back.¬†

‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ watching us?‚Äù Emily asked, her eyes wide with fear.¬†

I didn‚Äôt answer, but I could feel it‚Äîfeel something out there, lurking just beyond our reach, waiting.¬†

We continued to descend, passing the carcass of the bony fish as it slowly drifted into the abyss. The tension in the sub was suffocating, every sound amplified by our growing fear.¬†

Then, the lights flickered, casting eerie shadows inside the cabin. The sonar pinged again, and this time the blip was larger‚Äîcloser. I peered into the void through the viewport, straining to see past the narrow beam of light.¬†

And then, I saw it.¬†

At first, it was just a shape‚Äîindistinct, blending with the darkness. But as we descended further, more of the creature came into view. It was massive, its body sleek and sinuous, undulating through the water with a grace that belied its size. The ridges along its back glinted faintly in the light, each one as tall as a man.¬†

It was longer than the submersible, its form stretching into the blackness beyond what we could see. And it was watching us. I could feel its gaze, cold and unblinking, fixed on us like we were intruders in its domain.¬†

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Emily whispered, her hands trembling on the controls.¬†

The creature didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound. It simply hovered there, massive and terrifying, as though it were waiting. For what, I couldn‚Äôt say.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not attacking,‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ observing.‚Äù¬†

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. ‚ÄúWe need to leave.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt yet,‚Äù Emily replied, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúWe have to document this.‚Äù¬†

I understood the importance of what we were seeing‚Äîthis was a discovery unlike anything the world had ever known. But the rational part of my brain was screaming at me to get out, to surface, to put as much distance between us and that thing as possible.¬†

The creature shifted slightly, and for a moment, I saw its eyes‚Äîhuge, black, and unfeeling. They reflected the lights of the sub like twin voids, as though they could swallow the entire ocean.¬†

‚ÄúWe need to leave. Now,‚Äù I said, louder this time, panic rising in my chest.¬†

Emily didn‚Äôt argue. She engaged the ascent, and slowly, the sub began to rise, leaving the creature behind. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being followed.¬†

And in the depths of my mind, a terrible thought began to form.¬†

What if it‚Äôs not the only one?¬†

The oppressive silence of the ocean weighed heavier than ever as we prepared for another descent. My heart pounded, a rhythm of dread that wouldn‚Äôt settle. The memory of that immense creature watching us lingered like a shadow, darkening my thoughts. Yet here we were, descending once more into its domain.¬†

Emily checked the controls, her hands shaky. ‚ÄúSonar‚Äôs clean,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù¬†

Dr. Miles adjusted the data logs beside me, but I could tell his mind wasn‚Äôt on them. He was scanning the dark depths as though waiting for something to emerge. We all were.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this quick,‚Äù I said, my tone sharper than intended.¬†

The submersible sank deeper, the cold blue light of the surface fading as we descended into the abyss once again. Each meter felt like a countdown, the atmosphere thickening with every second. The creature had made its presence clear last time‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt happy. We had intruded once too often, and now, with every dive, the tension grew more palpable.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Emily whispered, though no one responded. We all felt it‚Äîthe invisible threat lurking just out of sight, ready to strike.¬†

The eerie hum of the ocean filled the sub, a reminder of the miles of water pressing down on us. The whale bones loomed again in the dim light, but this time, we didn‚Äôt stop to marvel. We all felt the growing unease, the sensation that something unseen was closing in around us.¬†

And then the sonar blipped.¬†

Just a single, small ping.¬†

My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs back,‚Äù I said.¬†

The creature hadn‚Äôt shown itself yet, but I could feel it. The hairs on my arms stood on end, a primal instinct warning me that we weren‚Äôt alone.¬†

The submersible rattled as the ocean currents shifted, or at least that‚Äôs what I tried to tell myself. Emily adjusted the thrusters, her fingers trembling on the controls. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moving faster this time,‚Äù she muttered.¬†

I leaned forward, eyes glued to the viewport, straining to catch a glimpse of anything in the inky black. There! A shadow, larger than life, flickered at the edge of our lights. The sub shook, a sudden jolt that sent equipment rattling.¬†

‚ÄúIs it‚Äî‚Äù Emily started, but before she could finish, the lights dimmed.¬†

Another tremor, this one more violent, rocked the submersible, causing the instruments to flicker wildly.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting angry,‚Äù Dr. Miles muttered, his knuckles white as he gripped the armrests.¬†

The creature, whatever it was, had started circling us, more agitated than ever. Its movements were sharper now, its form more aggressive as it swam just beyond our lights‚Äô reach, occasionally brushing against the sub with a force that sent us all reeling.¬†

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúEmily, bring us up. Now.‚Äù¬†

She didn‚Äôt argue. The engines roared as we started our ascent, but the creature didn‚Äôt fall back this time. It followed us, circling tighter, closer. The lights flickered again, casting its massive form in fleeting glimpses‚Äîscales the size of windows, ridges along its spine, its serpentine body stretching into the darkness.¬†

As we rose, the creature moved with us, shadowing every meter we climbed. But something had changed in its behavior. The movements were faster, more erratic. It darted in and out of our periphery like a predator losing patience with its prey.¬†

Panic clawed at my chest. ‚ÄúFaster, Emily!‚Äù¬†

The sub creaked under the strain as we pushed the engines to their limit. We were ascending faster than before, the pressure inside the cabin palpable.¬†

And then, just as we thought we were gaining distance, the sonar blared‚Äîa new signal.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his eyes wide with alarm.¬†

Before we could react, the sub was struck with a bone-rattling force. The lights flickered violently, plunging us into darkness before flashing back on. I whipped around to the viewport, my breath caught in my throat.¬†

There, directly in front of us, was a bony fish‚Äîa massive one. Its dead, glassy eyes stared straight at us as it rammed the sub again, its enormous jaws snapping at the hull. It was easily the size of a whale, its armored scales shimmering as it twisted and thrashed against us.¬†

‚ÄúHoly‚Äî‚Äù Emily started, but she was cut off as the sub lurched again.¬†

The fish struck us repeatedly, the force of its attacks sending shockwaves through the sub. I gripped the seat, heart pounding in my ears. We were being torn apart from the outside.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to break us in half!‚Äù Dr. Miles shouted.¬†

Suddenly, the sonar screamed again‚Äîanother blip, larger this time.¬†

The creature.¬†

It moved with a sudden, predatory grace, streaking through the darkness toward the bony fish. Its body slammed into the fish with a thunderous impact, sending both creatures spiraling away from us. The sub stabilized, though barely.¬†

I watched, breathless, as the two titans clashed in the murky water. The fish thrashed, but the creature‚Äîour creature‚Äîwas faster, stronger. Its jaws clamped down on the fish‚Äôs midsection with terrifying force, ripping through the armored plates like they were nothing. The fish struggled, but it was no match.¬†

We had a front-row seat to the monstrous battle unfolding before us, and for the first time, we saw the full size of the cosmic horror that had been following us.¬†

It was massive‚Äîfar larger than anything we had imagined. Its body seemed endless, stretching far beyond the range of our lights, its undulating mass dwarfing the fish that had attacked us. Ridged spines lined its back, each one sharp as a blade, while its serpentine body moved with an eerie, almost otherworldly grace.¬†

It tore into the bony fish with a savagery that left us all speechless. In seconds, the fish was reduced to a floating mass of torn flesh and bone, its armored plates drifting in the water like debris.¬†

And then the creature turned its gaze back to us.¬†

My breath caught in my throat as its eyes‚Äîthose cold, black, endless eyes‚Äîfixed on the sub once more. It floated there, still and silent, as though deciding what to do with us. We were at its mercy, tiny, insignificant.¬†

‚ÄúGo,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù¬†

Emily didn‚Äôt need any more encouragement. The engines roared as we ascended faster, leaving the bloodied water behind. But the creature stayed with us, following us as we climbed toward the light.¬†

It didn‚Äôt attack, but it didn‚Äôt leave, either. It simply watched, keeping pace, its massive form shadowing us like a dark omen, filling every moment with dread.¬†

We were nearing the surface now, the water growing lighter, the pressure less intense. But the creature‚Äîthis thing‚Äîdidn‚Äôt retreat. It swam just below us, unseen, but felt. Always felt.¬†

As we breached the surface, gasping for air as though we had been drowning, the sub shuddered once more‚Äîa final reminder that we weren‚Äôt alone. We never had been.¬†

The creature was still there, lurking just beneath the waves. Watching. Waiting.¬†

Three days had passed since our encounter with the creature. It felt longer. The oppressive weight of what we had witnessed gnawed at us, casting a shadow over everything. No one spoke of it directly, but the tension was suffocating, the fear palpable in the air. I could see it in the way Emily‚Äôs hands shook as she poured coffee, in the way Dr. Miles stared off into the distance, lost in thought. We were supposed to be scientists, logical minds driven by discovery, but nothing could prepare us for what we‚Äôd seen down there. No amount of data could make sense of it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going back,‚Äù Emily said one morning, breaking the uneasy silence that had settled over the lab.¬†

None of us replied immediately. Dr. Miles glanced at me, his eyes heavy with exhaustion, silently asking me to say something. But I felt the same as Emily‚Äînone of us wanted to return to the abyss. The mere thought of it sent chills down my spine.¬†

‚ÄúWe have to,‚Äù Dr. Miles finally said, though his voice lacked conviction. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much at stake.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor who?‚Äù Emily snapped, her voice rising in frustration. ‚ÄúFor the people funding this expedition? Do they have any idea what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù¬†

Silence again. She was right. The higher-ups had no clue. They hadn‚Äôt seen the creature, hadn‚Äôt felt the primal terror of being watched, stalked, and nearly destroyed. But they had expectations. They wanted results. And now they were pushing us to dive again, as if what had happened could be chalked up to some minor setback.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not equipped for this,‚Äù I said, my voice low but firm. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù Emily said. ‚ÄúWe barely made it out last time. What‚Äôs going to happen if it‚Äôs more aggressive this time? Or worse‚Äîwhat if it‚Äôs not alone?‚Äù¬†

That question hung in the air like a curse. None of us had considered the possibility before, but now it seemed glaringly obvious. The creature was territorial. What if there were more of them? What if we had only encountered one of a species? A shiver ran down my spine.¬†

Dr. Miles rubbed his face with his hands, looking as worn down as the rest of us. ‚ÄúWe have to go back,‚Äù he said again, more to himself than anyone else. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll send someone else.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd let them,‚Äù Emily shot back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù¬†

A few more days passed in this limbo of indecision. None of us were eager to confront the abyss again, but we all knew what it meant if we didn‚Äôt. The funding would dry up. The reputation of the team would suffer. But worst of all, someone else‚Äîlikely far less prepared‚Äîwould dive in our place. Could we live with that on our consciences?¬†

Ultimately, it was the pressure from above that broke us. A barrage of emails and calls, urging us to continue the mission, emphasizing the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù of the research, the ‚Äúopportunity of a lifetime.‚Äù Words that meant nothing in the face of the terror waiting below.¬†

We agreed, reluctantly, to descend once more. But none of us felt right about it. Emily was quiet as she prepped the submersible, her movements robotic. Dr. Miles stayed focused on the data, avoiding eye contact with either of us. And I‚ÄîI just felt numb.¬†

As we lowered into the water again, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that this was a mistake. The ocean welcomed us with the same cold, unforgiving silence, but this time it felt more oppressive, as if it knew what was coming.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it short,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll gather data, take a few samples, and head back up.‚Äù¬†

No one argued.¬†

The sub descended slowly, the lights piercing the dark water in thin beams. My stomach churned with unease as we passed the point where we had first encountered the creature. Every shadow seemed like it could hide something. Every flicker of movement sent a spike of adrenaline through me.¬†

But this time, there was nothing. No sign of the creature. No eerie pings on the sonar. Just the silent expanse of the deep.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Emily muttered under her breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too quiet.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt like it either. My mind kept wandering back to the last dive, to the way the creature had stalked us, watching, waiting. Was it still down here? Was it watching us now, hidden just beyond the reach of our lights?¬†

Suddenly, the sonar blipped.¬†

Emily froze. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù¬†

We all stared at the sonar, waiting for another blip, another signal that something was out there. But nothing came. The screen stayed clear.¬†

‚ÄúFalse alarm?‚Äù Dr. Miles suggested, though even he didn‚Äôt sound convinced.¬†

I nodded, trying to calm my nerves. ‚ÄúMaybe just a glitch.‚Äù¬†

We continued our descent, deeper and deeper into the abyss, and the further we went, the more wrong everything felt. My gut twisted with an instinctive warning that screamed at me to turn back. But we kept going. We had to.¬†

And then we saw them.¬†

Lights. Bright, artificial lights cutting through the dark water below us.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù Emily whispered.¬†

Dr. Miles leaned forward, squinting through the viewport. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not us.‚Äù¬†

The lights grew brighter as we descended further, until we could make out the shapes of several large, submersible crafts, their outlines sharp and metallic. It took a moment for my brain to process what I was seeing.¬†

Military vessels.¬†

‚ÄúThey know,‚Äù I breathed.¬†

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Emily asked, her voice tight with fear. ‚ÄúHow could they know?‚Äù¬†

My mind raced. Had they been tracking us? Monitoring our data? Or had they encountered the creature too and decided to take matters into their own hands?¬†

As we drifted closer, the sub‚Äôs sonar began blaring with signals. The military subs were heavily armed, their presence an ominous sign that something far bigger was happening.¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre down here for the creature,‚Äù Dr. Miles muttered, as if speaking the thought aloud made it more real.¬†

But that wasn‚Äôt the worst part. The worst part was the sinking realization that we were no longer in control. Whatever was about to happen was beyond our reach, and we were caught in the middle of it.¬†

Emily‚Äôs voice trembled as she spoke. ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. All I knew was that something terrible was coming.¬†

And then, just as we hovered above the military subs, the sonar screeched.¬†

A new blip appeared on the screen.¬†

The creature had returned.¬†

We met almost 9 years ago and had been engaged for 1 year. We're all we've ever known. No previous problems prior. I found out that she had been having a physical and emotional affair with a military friend for 10 months during our engagement which ended after my brother found them on a date. She said that she loved him at the same time she loved me. She kept everything a secret from AP and I during that time. She even kept it secret from friends and her family whom she lives with.  I immediately asked for the ring back within 24 hours of finding out.

The last two months had been traumatic for both of us. She's been enormously remorseful, regretful and ashamed for what she did. She quit the gym that they both attended, I saw her end it with AP with text, and she's deleted all of her social media accounts. She's been going through therapy since then. I've been going through therapy as well.

We've been seeing each other in public spaces like parks or coffee shops several times just talking about how we've been feeling. I've acknowledged my shortcomings and she's talked to me about hers, and how we're both improving to each other. Each time has been like a ""last time,"" but we're too weak or attached.

I have four and a half years left on my current career before I can do a full pension retirement, so I‚Äôm trying to plan for the future.

I plan to try to truly learn iOS programming so I can create the LLC and work ~20 hours a week on my own hours, being my own boss, doing what I find really enjoyable and fun.

1gc270p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1gc270p/is_a_retroid_pocket_5_pro_likely_and_what/,Is a Retroid Pocket 5 Pro likely? And what Specs/Price do you guys think it will have?,"Man... this is going to be a long read.

So let me paint the full picture of how I started to think about this:

I got into portable Emulators a few months ago, started with the Miyoo Mini+, to be more precise the urge for it started when I installed EmuDeck on the Steam Deck, started to get the scratch for retro gaming.

The current lineup is the MM+, a New 2DS XL, a Switch, and a Steam Deck, and for a while I've wanted something to fill that gap between the MM+ and the Switch, for example:

* I use my MM+ for everything up to some PSX titles, in some cases the form factor is too small to play comfortably, like in older Armored Core games, too cramped for me to make it work unfortunately.
* Then the 2DS is used for everything of the DS family, nothing better to play DS games than that imo, simple as that, hacking a 3/2DS is easy as heck too.
* The Switch is for Switch games, I could play them on the Deck using Yuzu/Sudachi, but Nintendo is closing the circle for Switch Emulators, all projects are forks of forks, I can't be bothered with fidgeting configs every time I want to play something, waiting for updates, yeah I'll do it now and then for GC/PS2 in some cases on the Deck, but not every single game, sometimes I just want to sit down on the couch and play a game, the Switch fits that perfectly, I don't need to run Tears of the Kingdom at 4K 60 FPS, I simply want to play it. Plus, the Switch is the only console I own that I collect games for in physical format, I think many of you guys also enjoy the novelty of collecting games.
* The Deck is the emulation powerhouse, if something doesn't run then it is a compatibility issue, not a lackluster hardware.

The problem with the current lineup is, the Switch and Deck are powerful, but they are not pocketable at all.

Yeah, I can throw them both inside my bag with ease, take them to work, college, and I do play on them during lunch breaks, extended periods of time, but the real portable heavy lifting is being done by the MM+ and the DS currently, they're the ones I can take out of my pocket, play for 10-15min while I take a break for coffee at work, or between classes in college, enough time to finish a stage in Mario/DK/Kirby, and then get back to slaving away in the office. The Deck and the Switch are too big for that, bulky, if the boss catches me whipping out a whole-ass gaming console from inside my bag and going to grab a coffee, I'm going to need to find a new job.

Then, there's that sweetspot, that mid-range, that I'm looking for that Unicorn console to fit my needs, my Knight in Shining (or matte?) plastic Armor, something that will play everything from PSX titles to PS2, GameCube, Wii, perhaps even one or two lighter Switch games.

So, the search began, and is going for a while now, at the time I started looking there was the Retroid Pocket 3/3+/4 Pro, the Ayn Odin 1 and 2, but none of them were perfect for what I wanted at the time, felt like the Retroids were not going to fill what I wanted in the power department, yes they are beefy for most stuff, but just seeing how powerful the Odin 2 is, running most stuff at 4x or more in the PS2 and GC, but then the Odin 2 is big, it's not a small form factor, not enough at least.

Then the Odin 2 Mini was announced, and I was pretty hyped for it, been holding out for a while on buying it because a 339 dollar price tag is a hefty amount, but it felt like it ticked most boxes.

The only gripe with it is the screen, the MiniLED screen is bright, but from video reviews it seems too white, like, the white is so bright that it's washing up colors, it could be just a thing happening because of how the cameras are capturing the display, but it's something I feel like would bother me.

For a while, it was just the Odin 2 Mini as an option, but then we are now getting a Retroid Pocket 5, and man, that AMOLED screen looks juicy, looks sharp, and it's a liiiiittle bit bigger at 5'5 inches, compared to the 5"" from the O2Mini, but sizing is not overall much different, just a single mm bigger on the RP5, the price is also teased as cheaper, 120 dollars cheaper on Retroid's official website.

The only thing I still found a little bit lacking in the RP5 is the processor, yeah the SD865 is very capable, no slouch, but the 8 Gen 2 blows it out of the water, and the overall package the Odin 2 Mini offers is more powerful.

So the question is, is a Retroid Pocket 5+ or 5 Pro a possibility (most likely yes but..)? Tad bit better chip, running 3x@60FPS or more on PS2 titles, AMOLED screen, or heck, an Ayn Odin 2 Mini chip but with the 5.5"" AMOLED, form factor, etc, they ARE owned by the same company after all.

The later would be my dream console, that slick PS Vita look, superb screen and performance to make it pop, I'm almost drooling from thinking about it, DAMN.

  
TL;DR: I want a powerhouse of a device with an AMOLED screen and small form factor, Ayn/Retroid PLEASE make it happen, I bet more people would pay good money for it.",0,1729883599.0,SBCGaming,11,0.14,False

Quick backstory: I moved across the country during Covid and wasn't sure how long I would stay here. I initially only planned to stay for 6 months to 1 year, so got furniture to reflect that. That was 3 years ago...

I don't hate my current living room, but it's not something I'm proud of. Somethings I don't like:

\- TV stand: I already had the same stand but the 2x4 version from Ikea so I though ""lets get the matching set""... i absolutely hate the way it looks. I had the default white 7"" Ikea platform feet under it, but it made it somehow look worse. I think getting a 5 pack of some 2"" feet would make it look decent enough, but open to suggestions

\- Corner Light: I feel like this light makes my apartment look like a college dorm. I just hate big lights and prefer a lot of small lights. I thought this would bounce the light off of the walls and ceiling nicely without being too harsh, but in hindsight... I'm a dumbass

\- TV Wall: This wall is WAY to empty! I need to put something on there to fill it up or it will drive me crazy! That one wall is what i hate most of this entire room. I've been thinking about moving all the crap in the right corner and getting a really large plant, and maybe putting up some art/large photos on the wall. I hike a lot and thought maybe it would be a neat idea to use some of the wider photos I took to get them framed?? Some ideas: [https://imgur.com/a/LsJ5nZ4](https://imgur.com/a/LsJ5nZ4)

Something I want to incorporate:

\- I have a lot of drawings from my little sister who I grew up very close with. I have two of them framed already and want to keep these even if people think they are tacky. They have a lot of meaning to me so they stay no matter what.

\- I want to add photos of my friends and family somewhere as well. Right now, I just have different polaroids and photos tucked into the sides of the 2 framed drawings from my sister (turned around for privacy). I use to be a bit into photography and have some neat photos (neat to me at least) that I would want to add somewhere. I just don't know how without creating a generic ""hanging photo wall"" that doesn't look great.

\- More plants! I kept trying to have different plants since I moved here and they all kept dying on me :( I've finally been able to keep the 3 plants I have right now for over 8 months, so I'm ready for some more plants with a bigger challenge :)

\- Everyone I keep talking to says get a carpet and coffee table. I definitely like the idea of a coffee table, but just not sure what style to get to fit this area. There are so many different shades and material types already!

I have about $800-1,000 saved up for changing things up a bit, but I want to spend $200 on a second-hand soundbar and another $100 on a new table top for my desk so about $700 to play around with otherwise.

I would super greatly appreciate any help!

My preferences generally lean toward drier compositions... Spices, incense, woods, barnyardy ouds. 'Sweet/Gourmand' tend to be things I avoid, but I tried some decants out here in an effort to keep an open mind.

**Lattafa Vintage Radio** The listed lavender-sage opening makes a brief appearance before being steamrolled by what presents as a candied plum accord. That sweetness has impressive stamina, though the drydown finally delivers with some genuinely pleasant palo santo and sandalwood. Technically accomplished, but not quite to my tastes.

**Lattafa Liam Grey** The most interesting of the bunch, though it opens like it has something to prove. That initial blast is almost certainly a heavy-handed dose of cashmeran doing its best ""scratchy woody musk"" impression to my nose, but I might just be sensitive to that. Thankfully, an excellent tea note manages to elbow its way through, and the fig (maybe gamma-octalactone with some green supporting actors? I can see some of the 'coconut' impressions I've read making sense ) plays well with the sandalwood base. The iris seems more interested in texture than powder, while the labdanum adds just enough warmth without triggering my sweet-syrupy-detector.

**Paris Corner Emir You're Drugged** Naming conventions aside, the opening and early mid are genuinely accomplished and to my taste. Heavy on green cardamom and what I swear is fir balsam (checking Intoxicated's notes validates my sanity, a little, so maybe I didn't hallucinate that ). The spice blend is bold, though the promised coffee note is more ""theoretical construct"" than actual presence to what I can detect. Unfortunately, after this impressive display of personality, it settles into what I can only describe as Generic Base‚Ñ¢. The whiskey note might explain what I'm reading as balsamic, though that could be wishful thinking.

**Paris Corner Emir Rifaaqat** My 9-year-old's favorite, which either speaks to their developing taste or my jaded nose. A spicy vanilla that shows admirable restraint with sweetness, and the saffron-suede accord is handled with surprising finesse. Claims of smoke seem optimistic - though given my regular exposure to Terror & Magnificence, I might need an actual forest fire to register smoke notes at this point. Edges out Liam Grey, maybe, in overall quality, though I personally find LG more interesting.

**Lattafa Al Nashama Caprice** The cardamom-lavender backbone is expertly constructed, with mint and geranium providing lift without zooming off into full barbershop territory. The base is thoroughly modern - clean woods and a patchouli that's learned to use its inside voice. It's the fragrance equivalent of a perfectly formatted resume - technically flawless but somehow less interesting for it. It's quite well done, but I don't know that I could pick it out of a lineup of blue-ish designer masculines.",1,1729883217.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

I sat in the control room, staring blankly at the monitor. The sonar‚Äôs rhythmic pings filled the silence, but they felt hollow now, like the echo of something far more sinister. Emily and Dr. Miles sat beside me, neither saying a word. We had ascended hours ago, and the surface world should have brought a sense of safety. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we hadn‚Äôt left it behind. Not really.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, there was something down there,‚Äù I said, breaking the silence.¬†

Dr. Miles exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúWe know. We all saw it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe need to report this,‚Äù Emily chimed in, her voice hoarse from the strain of the dive. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äîit‚Äôs massive. And it‚Äôs watching us.‚Äù¬†

We sent our report to the expedition sponsors. As the lead scientist, I‚Äôd be the one to communicate directly with them, explain everything. I‚Äôd done it countless times before‚Äîrattling off findings, charting data, and impressing people with cold hard facts. But this was different.¬†

As I prepared the message, my thoughts drifted back to a time before this expedition‚Äîa time when my curiosity had been my only driving force. I had spent years studying marine life, seeking out the rarest, most elusive species, never imagining that one day I‚Äôd encounter something like this. Something I couldn‚Äôt quantify. ¬†¬†

My career had been marked by success, driven by my obsession with the unknown. But that same obsession had cost me, too. I‚Äôd lost friends, relationships‚Äîpeople who couldn‚Äôt understand why I would spend months at sea, chasing shadows in the water. They‚Äôd call me reckless. Some even called me a fool.¬†

But I‚Äôd never cared. Until now.¬†

¬†

The call came back, as clinical and dispassionate as I‚Äôd feared. A voice crackled over the comms, thick with bureaucratic detachment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received your report, Doctor. However, we urge you to proceed with the expedition. The funding for this mission is substantial, and we expect results.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúResults?‚Äù I repeated, incredulous. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about an unidentified creature, one that could pose a serious threat not just to us but to‚Äî‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe appreciate your concerns, but you‚Äôre there for research, not speculation. The deep ocean is an unexplored frontier, Doctor. Find what you can, document it, and return. We trust your team to handle the risks.‚Äù¬†

I glanced at Dr. Miles and Emily. They were listening in, waiting for the verdict. My heart sank as I muttered, ‚ÄúThey want us to continue.‚Äù¬†

Emily shook her head, frustration flickering across her face. ‚ÄúAre they insane? We barely made it back.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMoney talks,‚Äù Dr. Miles said bitterly, folding his arms. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care about the risks. Just the data.‚Äù¬†

I thought about pushing back, but what would be the point? The expedition was their investment. We were just tools, instruments to gather information they could use. And if that meant throwing us back into the depths with a creature we barely understood‚Äîso be it.¬†

¬†

We descended again the next day. The unease sat heavy in the air. This time, none of us spoke as we prepared the submersible, our movements robotic and grim. There was no sense of wonder now, no excitement about the unknown. Only dread.¬†

Emily initiated the descent, and the sub slipped beneath the waves, once again swallowed by the cold blackness of the deep ocean. The familiar hum of the engines was the only sound, and even that seemed muffled, as though the water itself was holding its breath.¬†

‚ÄúSonar‚Äôs clear,‚Äù Emily muttered. ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù¬†

We reached the depth where the whale skeleton had been discovered on the previous dive. But as we approached, something new came into view. Something that sent a shiver down my spine.¬†

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I whispered.¬†

Emily slowed the sub‚Äôs descent, and there it was‚Äîfloating in the abyss like a grotesque monument to death.¬†

A massive fish, its body stiff and contorted in death‚Äôs grip, drifted lifeless before us. Its bony frame was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen‚Äîlong, armored ridges along its back, rows of razor-sharp teeth protruding from its gaping maw. It was easily twice the size of a whale, and its eyes‚Äîthough lifeless‚Äîseemed to stare at us, wide and glassy.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is that?‚Äù Emily stammered.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a fish that large,‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his voice tight. ‚ÄúNothing documented even comes close.‚Äù¬†

The creature had been torn apart. Huge chunks of its flesh were missing, revealing bone and sinew. Jagged wounds, like something had bitten clean through it. My mind raced, trying to make sense of the scene, but one thought screamed louder than the others.¬†

Whatever did this was bigger. Much, much bigger.¬†

‚ÄúThis is fresh,‚Äù I murmured, my breath fogging the glass of the viewport. ‚ÄúIt just happened.‚Äù¬†

We stared at the mangled corpse in stunned silence, the implications sinking in. This thing hadn‚Äôt died of natural causes. It had been hunted, attacked.¬†

And we were in the territory of the hunter.¬†

¬†

The sonar pinged again, a single faint blip on the screen. My heart skipped a beat. It was back.¬†

‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ watching us?‚Äù Emily asked, her eyes wide with fear.¬†

I didn‚Äôt answer, but I could feel it‚Äîfeel something out there, lurking just beyond our reach, waiting.¬†

We continued to descend, passing the carcass of the bony fish as it slowly drifted into the abyss. The tension in the sub was suffocating, every sound amplified by our growing fear.¬†

Then, the lights flickered, casting eerie shadows inside the cabin. The sonar pinged again, and this time the blip was larger‚Äîcloser. I peered into the void through the viewport, straining to see past the narrow beam of light.¬†

And then, I saw it.¬†

At first, it was just a shape‚Äîindistinct, blending with the darkness. But as we descended further, more of the creature came into view. It was massive, its body sleek and sinuous, undulating through the water with a grace that belied its size. The ridges along its back glinted faintly in the light, each one as tall as a man.¬†

It was longer than the submersible, its form stretching into the blackness beyond what we could see. And it was watching us. I could feel its gaze, cold and unblinking, fixed on us like we were intruders in its domain.¬†

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Emily whispered, her hands trembling on the controls.¬†

The creature didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound. It simply hovered there, massive and terrifying, as though it were waiting. For what, I couldn‚Äôt say.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not attacking,‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ observing.‚Äù¬†

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. ‚ÄúWe need to leave.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt yet,‚Äù Emily replied, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúWe have to document this.‚Äù¬†

I understood the importance of what we were seeing‚Äîthis was a discovery unlike anything the world had ever known. But the rational part of my brain was screaming at me to get out, to surface, to put as much distance between us and that thing as possible.¬†

The creature shifted slightly, and for a moment, I saw its eyes‚Äîhuge, black, and unfeeling. They reflected the lights of the sub like twin voids, as though they could swallow the entire ocean.¬†

‚ÄúWe need to leave. Now,‚Äù I said, louder this time, panic rising in my chest.¬†

Emily didn‚Äôt argue. She engaged the ascent, and slowly, the sub began to rise, leaving the creature behind. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we were being followed.¬†

And in the depths of my mind, a terrible thought began to form.¬†

What if it‚Äôs not the only one?¬†

The oppressive silence of the ocean weighed heavier than ever as we prepared for another descent. My heart pounded, a rhythm of dread that wouldn‚Äôt settle. The memory of that immense creature watching us lingered like a shadow, darkening my thoughts. Yet here we were, descending once more into its domain.¬†

Emily checked the controls, her hands shaky. ‚ÄúSonar‚Äôs clean,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù¬†

Dr. Miles adjusted the data logs beside me, but I could tell his mind wasn‚Äôt on them. He was scanning the dark depths as though waiting for something to emerge. We all were.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this quick,‚Äù I said, my tone sharper than intended.¬†

The submersible sank deeper, the cold blue light of the surface fading as we descended into the abyss once again. Each meter felt like a countdown, the atmosphere thickening with every second. The creature had made its presence clear last time‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt happy. We had intruded once too often, and now, with every dive, the tension grew more palpable.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Emily whispered, though no one responded. We all felt it‚Äîthe invisible threat lurking just out of sight, ready to strike.¬†

The eerie hum of the ocean filled the sub, a reminder of the miles of water pressing down on us. The whale bones loomed again in the dim light, but this time, we didn‚Äôt stop to marvel. We all felt the growing unease, the sensation that something unseen was closing in around us.¬†

And then the sonar blipped.¬†

Just a single, small ping.¬†

My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs back,‚Äù I said.¬†

The creature hadn‚Äôt shown itself yet, but I could feel it. The hairs on my arms stood on end, a primal instinct warning me that we weren‚Äôt alone.¬†

The submersible rattled as the ocean currents shifted, or at least that‚Äôs what I tried to tell myself. Emily adjusted the thrusters, her fingers trembling on the controls. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moving faster this time,‚Äù she muttered.¬†

I leaned forward, eyes glued to the viewport, straining to catch a glimpse of anything in the inky black. There! A shadow, larger than life, flickered at the edge of our lights. The sub shook, a sudden jolt that sent equipment rattling.¬†

‚ÄúIs it‚Äî‚Äù Emily started, but before she could finish, the lights dimmed.¬†

Another tremor, this one more violent, rocked the submersible, causing the instruments to flicker wildly.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting angry,‚Äù Dr. Miles muttered, his knuckles white as he gripped the armrests.¬†

The creature, whatever it was, had started circling us, more agitated than ever. Its movements were sharper now, its form more aggressive as it swam just beyond our lights‚Äô reach, occasionally brushing against the sub with a force that sent us all reeling.¬†

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúEmily, bring us up. Now.‚Äù¬†

She didn‚Äôt argue. The engines roared as we started our ascent, but the creature didn‚Äôt fall back this time. It followed us, circling tighter, closer. The lights flickered again, casting its massive form in fleeting glimpses‚Äîscales the size of windows, ridges along its spine, its serpentine body stretching into the darkness.¬†

As we rose, the creature moved with us, shadowing every meter we climbed. But something had changed in its behavior. The movements were faster, more erratic. It darted in and out of our periphery like a predator losing patience with its prey.¬†

Panic clawed at my chest. ‚ÄúFaster, Emily!‚Äù¬†

The sub creaked under the strain as we pushed the engines to their limit. We were ascending faster than before, the pressure inside the cabin palpable.¬†

And then, just as we thought we were gaining distance, the sonar blared‚Äîa new signal.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Dr. Miles said, his eyes wide with alarm.¬†

Before we could react, the sub was struck with a bone-rattling force. The lights flickered violently, plunging us into darkness before flashing back on. I whipped around to the viewport, my breath caught in my throat.¬†

There, directly in front of us, was a bony fish‚Äîa massive one. Its dead, glassy eyes stared straight at us as it rammed the sub again, its enormous jaws snapping at the hull. It was easily the size of a whale, its armored scales shimmering as it twisted and thrashed against us.¬†

‚ÄúHoly‚Äî‚Äù Emily started, but she was cut off as the sub lurched again.¬†

The fish struck us repeatedly, the force of its attacks sending shockwaves through the sub. I gripped the seat, heart pounding in my ears. We were being torn apart from the outside.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to break us in half!‚Äù Dr. Miles shouted.¬†

Suddenly, the sonar screamed again‚Äîanother blip, larger this time.¬†

The creature.¬†

It moved with a sudden, predatory grace, streaking through the darkness toward the bony fish. Its body slammed into the fish with a thunderous impact, sending both creatures spiraling away from us. The sub stabilized, though barely.¬†

I watched, breathless, as the two titans clashed in the murky water. The fish thrashed, but the creature‚Äîour creature‚Äîwas faster, stronger. Its jaws clamped down on the fish‚Äôs midsection with terrifying force, ripping through the armored plates like they were nothing. The fish struggled, but it was no match.¬†

We had a front-row seat to the monstrous battle unfolding before us, and for the first time, we saw the full size of the cosmic horror that had been following us.¬†

It was massive‚Äîfar larger than anything we had imagined. Its body seemed endless, stretching far beyond the range of our lights, its undulating mass dwarfing the fish that had attacked us. Ridged spines lined its back, each one sharp as a blade, while its serpentine body moved with an eerie, almost otherworldly grace.¬†

It tore into the bony fish with a savagery that left us all speechless. In seconds, the fish was reduced to a floating mass of torn flesh and bone, its armored plates drifting in the water like debris.¬†

And then the creature turned its gaze back to us.¬†

My breath caught in my throat as its eyes‚Äîthose cold, black, endless eyes‚Äîfixed on the sub once more. It floated there, still and silent, as though deciding what to do with us. We were at its mercy, tiny, insignificant.¬†

‚ÄúGo,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù¬†

Emily didn‚Äôt need any more encouragement. The engines roared as we ascended faster, leaving the bloodied water behind. But the creature stayed with us, following us as we climbed toward the light.¬†

It didn‚Äôt attack, but it didn‚Äôt leave, either. It simply watched, keeping pace, its massive form shadowing us like a dark omen, filling every moment with dread.¬†

We were nearing the surface now, the water growing lighter, the pressure less intense. But the creature‚Äîthis thing‚Äîdidn‚Äôt retreat. It swam just below us, unseen, but felt. Always felt.¬†

As we breached the surface, gasping for air as though we had been drowning, the sub shuddered once more‚Äîa final reminder that we weren‚Äôt alone. We never had been.¬†

The creature was still there, lurking just beneath the waves. Watching. Waiting.¬†



Three days had passed since our encounter with the creature. It felt longer. The oppressive weight of what we had witnessed gnawed at us, casting a shadow over everything. No one spoke of it directly, but the tension was suffocating, the fear palpable in the air. I could see it in the way Emily‚Äôs hands shook as she poured coffee, in the way Dr. Miles stared off into the distance, lost in thought. We were supposed to be scientists, logical minds driven by discovery, but nothing could prepare us for what we‚Äôd seen down there. No amount of data could make sense of it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going back,‚Äù Emily said one morning, breaking the uneasy silence that had settled over the lab.¬†

None of us replied immediately. Dr. Miles glanced at me, his eyes heavy with exhaustion, silently asking me to say something. But I felt the same as Emily‚Äînone of us wanted to return to the abyss. The mere thought of it sent chills down my spine.¬†

‚ÄúWe have to,‚Äù Dr. Miles finally said, though his voice lacked conviction. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much at stake.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor who?‚Äù Emily snapped, her voice rising in frustration. ‚ÄúFor the people funding this expedition? Do they have any idea what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù¬†

Silence again. She was right. The higher-ups had no clue. They hadn‚Äôt seen the creature, hadn‚Äôt felt the primal terror of being watched, stalked, and nearly destroyed. But they had expectations. They wanted results. And now they were pushing us to dive again, as if what had happened could be chalked up to some minor setback.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not equipped for this,‚Äù I said, my voice low but firm. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù Emily said. ‚ÄúWe barely made it out last time. What‚Äôs going to happen if it‚Äôs more aggressive this time? Or worse‚Äîwhat if it‚Äôs not alone?‚Äù¬†

That question hung in the air like a curse. None of us had considered the possibility before, but now it seemed glaringly obvious. The creature was territorial. What if there were more of them? What if we had only encountered one of a species? A shiver ran down my spine.¬†

Dr. Miles rubbed his face with his hands, looking as worn down as the rest of us. ‚ÄúWe have to go back,‚Äù he said again, more to himself than anyone else. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll send someone else.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd let them,‚Äù Emily shot back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù¬†

A few more days passed in this limbo of indecision. None of us were eager to confront the abyss again, but we all knew what it meant if we didn‚Äôt. The funding would dry up. The reputation of the team would suffer. But worst of all, someone else‚Äîlikely far less prepared‚Äîwould dive in our place. Could we live with that on our consciences?¬†

Ultimately, it was the pressure from above that broke us. A barrage of emails and calls, urging us to continue the mission, emphasizing the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù of the research, the ‚Äúopportunity of a lifetime.‚Äù Words that meant nothing in the face of the terror waiting below.¬†

We agreed, reluctantly, to descend once more. But none of us felt right about it. Emily was quiet as she prepped the submersible, her movements robotic. Dr. Miles stayed focused on the data, avoiding eye contact with either of us. And I‚ÄîI just felt numb.¬†

As we lowered into the water again, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that this was a mistake. The ocean welcomed us with the same cold, unforgiving silence, but this time it felt more oppressive, as if it knew what was coming.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it short,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll gather data, take a few samples, and head back up.‚Äù¬†

No one argued.¬†

The sub descended slowly, the lights piercing the dark water in thin beams. My stomach churned with unease as we passed the point where we had first encountered the creature. Every shadow seemed like it could hide something. Every flicker of movement sent a spike of adrenaline through me.¬†

But this time, there was nothing. No sign of the creature. No eerie pings on the sonar. Just the silent expanse of the deep.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Emily muttered under her breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too quiet.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt like it either. My mind kept wandering back to the last dive, to the way the creature had stalked us, watching, waiting. Was it still down here? Was it watching us now, hidden just beyond the reach of our lights?¬†

Suddenly, the sonar blipped.¬†

Emily froze. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù¬†

We all stared at the sonar, waiting for another blip, another signal that something was out there. But nothing came. The screen stayed clear.¬†

‚ÄúFalse alarm?‚Äù Dr. Miles suggested, though even he didn‚Äôt sound convinced.¬†

I nodded, trying to calm my nerves. ‚ÄúMaybe just a glitch.‚Äù¬†

We continued our descent, deeper and deeper into the abyss, and the further we went, the more wrong everything felt. My gut twisted with an instinctive warning that screamed at me to turn back. But we kept going. We had to.¬†

And then we saw them.¬†

Lights. Bright, artificial lights cutting through the dark water below us.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù Emily whispered.¬†

Dr. Miles leaned forward, squinting through the viewport. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not us.‚Äù¬†

The lights grew brighter as we descended further, until we could make out the shapes of several large, submersible crafts, their outlines sharp and metallic. It took a moment for my brain to process what I was seeing.¬†

Military vessels.¬†

‚ÄúThey know,‚Äù I breathed.¬†

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Emily asked, her voice tight with fear. ‚ÄúHow could they know?‚Äù¬†

My mind raced. Had they been tracking us? Monitoring our data? Or had they encountered the creature too and decided to take matters into their own hands?¬†

As we drifted closer, the sub‚Äôs sonar began blaring with signals. The military subs were heavily armed, their presence an ominous sign that something far bigger was happening.¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre down here for the creature,‚Äù Dr. Miles muttered, as if speaking the thought aloud made it more real.¬†

But that wasn‚Äôt the worst part. The worst part was the sinking realization that we were no longer in control. Whatever was about to happen was beyond our reach, and we were caught in the middle of it.¬†

Emily‚Äôs voice trembled as she spoke. ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. All I knew was that something terrible was coming.¬†

And then, just as we hovered above the military subs, the sonar screeched.¬†

A new blip appeared on the screen.¬†

The creature had returned.¬†",2,1729882482.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

1gc1op3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/1gc1op3/awareness_prescience_mysticism_alia_unearthing/,"Awareness, Prescience, Mysticism, Alia. Unearthing the ""Magic"" of Dune. ","I've just finished *Dune* for the first time and WOAH I loved it. I cannot wait to start *Messiah!*

Now that I've finally finished the book and can rightfully interpret the book in my own way, I thought I'd share how I view the nature in which Frank Herbet explores ideas of *awareness* (or as we would probably refer to as conciousness) and its ties to mysticism.

In general usage, mysticism is probably more used to just define magic of some kind. But in its actual definition, and how I think Frank Herbet meants to explore it;

**Mysticsm is the concept of becoming one with God, or in this case, the universe.** It involves trascending oridinary perception and understanding through contemplation, mediation or **altered states of awareness**. Mystics seek **insight that go beyond conventional understanding or comprehension.**

For some context, when I first watched *Dune Part 1* & *2* I assumed Paul, and anyone with prescience, had to have had some level of ESP simply because there was simply too many variables he shouldn't be aware of without a 6th sense. That Kwisatz Haderach was a person that could ""psychically"" sense or see things that a normal person wouldn't, and that with mentat training and the ancestral memory, could accurately predict the future.

A lot of people didn't like this theory and were very adamant that there could be no ESP or anything ""psionic"" within the novels. That it was strictly sci-fi (though in my opinion, psychics are a staple of sci-fi powers but I digress). So I removed that concept from my mind and went into the book assuming that Paul was bred to be very smart and all my questions would be answered by him ancessing ancestral memory and a drug that makes you even smarter. That prescient beings were then to be no more than super computers that deals with probability.

So I started reading. I gasped at the beautifully written ways in which Herbert described Paul's visions, as if he was visualising his calculations so perfectly it was as if he was ascending into some astral realm where he could see all of spacetime unfurling before him.

I continued to read, and then I ran into mutliple glaringly obvious issues with the ""strict sci-fi"" approach to *Dune*.

1. Paul is constantly refering to his prescient vision as ""something more"" than his mentat abilties. That he is accesing a higher order dimensions.
2. The constant phrasing of ""*awarenses* expanding"" and becoming ""elevated"". Especially since awarnesss seems to be synonomous to the modern usage of ""conciousness"" or to be ""aware"" of something.
3. Guildsmen are prescient but have no access to ancestral memory and have no mentat training.
4. The Guildsmen were likely forseeing unaccounted objects (variables) in regions of space lightyears wide and long and were dodging them by the power of math alone.
5. The reveal that all of the Fremen are slightly prescient due to the spice consumption.
6. The tau of the tribe (Jessica almost considers it a hive mind, that they are all *aware* of each other in a way that transcends understanding)
7. The amount of times Frank Herbet literally writes ""not telepathy"" while describing something that exactly sounds like telepathy.
   1. This includes Jessica becoming Reverend Mother, how Alia and her communicate via *shared awareness* (as Herbert calls it) and how Alia is able to communciate to RM Gaius.

By the end of the book I realised I was right....at least partially. There is 100% something more than good math and psychology going on in *Dune* when it comes to prescience, spice, Reverend Mothers and the Kwisatz Haderach. Its not ESP and its not psychic, at least that is not the wording or concept Herbert wants to use.

*Dune*'s power system is the exploration of three concepts that all interplay with each other.

* Dualism
   * The concept that your mind/conciousness/*awareness* is seperate from your body (including the physical brain)
      * This includes the ""grounded"" abilities of the Bene Gesserit and Mentats.
      * This concept is fudementally what Herbert uses to provide reason for how prescience works. By your *awarensess* becoming heightened by spice, you can perceive higher order dimensions and achieve mysticism, becoming one with the universe.
* Mysticism
   * To expand or trascend once's conciousness/*awareness* to becoming one with the universe
   * To get insight of the very fabric of reality
   * This is done through the use of spice, which expands your *awareness* to perceive the fabric of spacetime.
* Higher order dimension
   * We live only perceive the first three dimension
   * Through concusiming spice you can perceive the fourth and fifth dimension
      * Fourth dimension is time
      * Fifth dimension is timelines (multiple)
      * The warping of spacetime and the branching of timelines is felt and seen by prescient users. Too much warping by decisions and probability causes higher order dimensions to become storm clouds of blind time.
   * Your trained *awareness* and genetic predisposition gives you various amounts of understanding of what you perceive while under spice influence and as such will either limit or expand prescience.
   * This is why Paul's disposition to be a mentat, and through his training as a mentat and bene gesserit, allows him to extend his prescience so far. Accessing ancestral memory allows him to understand and see even further.

To be prescient requires one or two thigns;

* Spice to expand your *awareness to see* fourth or fifth dimensional space.
* MAYBE some genetic predispostion to an expanding *awareness*.

But to be the Kwisatz Haderach requires much more;

* Genetic predisposition to an expanding *awareness* further than others
* Spice to expand your awareness to see fourth and fifth dimensional space.
* Probably genetic disposition to Bene Gesserit capabilities
* Bene Gesserit training
   * This makes you more in control of your *awareness*
   * Helps unlock your ancestral memory
      * Provides with virtually limitless psychological data on human behaviour
      * Provides with virtually limitless data about the human-experienced universe
      * Can live limitless human experiences
      * (Assumingly) gain the knowledge/teachings that your ancestral memory contains, such as becoming a pilot or chemical engineer
* Genetic predisposition to mentat capabilities
* Mentat training
   * To compute the limitless data granted by ancestral memory
   * To comprehend the higher order dimensions and the data it provides
   * To combine the data obtained by higher order dimensions and ancestral memory, present memory and to look even further into higher order dimensions.

Paul's prescience is the combination of so much more than just being a really good mentat with some really good genetics. Not only does he need the spice to expand his conciousness to perceive higher order dimensions, he needs his mentant capabilities to actually comprehend the limitless 3D, 4D and 5D data.

Walk with me.

Paul actually...is not mentally leaving his body or astral projecting, but he's also not just visualising probability as valleys of time or stratums. Rather, his *awareness* expands to be able to perceive higher order dimensional space (spacetime). He sees and feels the way in which spacetime bends and folds around him. He is able to see variables in spacetime he would need to predict outcomes via his mentat training. This would explain how Paul dreams of Chani without spice or ancestral memory. Or how the Guild's prescience works without mentat training. Perceiving higher order dimensions is acting as the ""ESP"" or the ""sixth sense"" in which prescient individuals can forsee the future even if they don't have all the available variables or numbers.

If spice is granting an increased *awareness* of spacial and temporal dimensions, and the ability to perceive the presence of another's *awareness*, things start to make more sense.

This would explain how the Guild actually travel through space. Its not just predicting collisions and avoiding them, they can forsee things in the present and the near future what would lay in their path on a upper dimensional level. This is how they navigate their ships through warped space. They can ""see"" this very warping. They ""see"" the objects ahead in time, but also how they imprint on the fabric space in the way all mass does.

This is also what allows them the Fremen their very limited perscience. Their expanded *awareness* also allows them to engage in the tau, the hive mind of the sietch. More on that later.

Paul is unique as not only has his genetics allowed him greater potential prescience, but he also has mentat training. His *awareness* is able to expand into the higher order dimensions further than anyone else due to his genetic predisposition and his mentat ability to perceive and calcuate all the data he gains from these dimensions.  And we see that from his very first ""waking"" prescient vision after being exposed to an increased level of spice.

>**Paul's mind had gone on in its chilling precision**. He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, **he focused his precient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery - as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and samples the winds of the future.**  
Abruptly, as though he had found a necassary key, **Paul's mind climbed antoher notch of awareness.** He felt himself clinging to this new level, clutching at a precarious hold and peering about. It was as though he existed within a globe of avenues radiating away in all directions...yet this only approximated the sensation.  
...  
**He saw people.**  
He felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.  
**He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of inumerable unexplored crannies.** There was time to probe and test, but no time to shape.  
The thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future - from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his own death in countless ways. **He saw new planets, new cultures.**  
**People.**  
**People.**  
**He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.**  
**Even the Guildsmen.**

Paul's *awareness* is expanding from the exposure to spice. First, his mentat abilities are going into overdrive, and can't stop collecting data around him. He makes a bunch of educated guesses about certain mysteries, such as that the Fremen is bribing the Guild to keep satelites off Arrakis. He then begins trying to see possible ways out of this predicement when suddenly his mind expands. He begins to perceive  something more. ""A mystery"". Paul is becomign aware of higher dimensions. He's becoming aware of the very fabric of spacetime. Not just imagining it, he's seeing it. Everytime Paul has prescient visions, it is similar to this wording and phrasing. *Awareness* becoming ascendent, visualising the bending and curvature of spactime, forseeing probable timelines, etc etc.

Paul repeatedly uses the phrase of ""sampling the winds of time"" rather than ""calculating data"" as he does in the earlier passage of his first awakening. He's accessing the higher dimensions, he's not just doing numbers.

Though I do believe Paul isn't always accessing his ""prescience"" as there are times Paul is just able to predict things by being a mentat and having an elevated *awareness.* Paul will just guess-timate something and it happens to be right. Such as when he figured out that the Fremen were bribing the Guild to keep satelites off of Arrakis. This was heightened mentat abilities, not prescience, though prescience may have provided him with some deeper insight.

Even Paul's Bene Gesserit skills are heightened with spice.

>""When next you find a mirror, **study your face - study mine now. The traces are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones.** And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. **I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens.""**

>*Great Mother! He's the Kwisatz Haderach!*

>...

>""You're thinking I'm the Kwisatz Haderach,"" he said. ""Put that out of your mind. I'm something unexpected""

>***I must get word out to one of the schools***\*\*, she thought.\*\* ***The mating index may show what has happened.***

>**""They won't learn about me until it's too late,"" he said**

In this, Paul again combines his ""grounded"" abilities, with his prescience. He forsees the a record telling him that Jessica is the daughter of the Baron, and to confirm his finding, he uses his Bene Gesserit training to register both Jessica's and his own physical appearance and finds the evidence he needs to see it true.

The Appendix says it in much more plain words in the way that prescience is its own power, but that mentant capabilties increase it.

>The Bene Gesserit programme had as its target the breeding of a person they labelled ""Kwisatz Haderach,"" a term signifying ""One who can be many places at once."" In simpler terms, what they sought was a **human with mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions.**  
They were breeding **a super-Mentat, a human computer with some of the prescient abilities found in Guild navigators.**

Again, prescience is NOT just a numbers game. Its the ability to extend your *awareness* into higher order dimensions (space and time) and perceive past, present and future.

And notice, it does not just say ""a super-Mentat"", the Kwisatz Haderach is someone who is BOTH a mentat and a prescient. These abilties exist SEPERETELY. And without mentat abilities and ancestral memory, both the Guild and Fremen are extremely limited in their prescience. That is because they are unable to ""use (or perceive/understand) higher order dimensions"" in the way that a mentat like Paul can.

I think its likely that many of them do not perceive fifth dimensional space, that is to say, they only see a very simple present/future that probably exists as a single branch of time. They are accurate because the most likely think its most like to happen but its not 100% fool proof. Paul, however, sees five dimensions which is how he perceives multiple time lines.

>The Guild navigators, gifted **with limited prescience**, had made the fatal decision: **they'd chosen always the clear, safe course** that leads ever downward into stagnation

Due the Guild's indability to perceive vast amounts of time, and possibly less timelines than Paul (perhaps sometimes only a straightfoward path), that they are unable to fully grasp fifth dimensional space in the way Paul can. This is why they go with whatever looks easiest, they have the clearest vision of it.

Another bit of evidence that prescience involves the *awareness* of higher dimensions, not just the calcuation of probability, is that prescienct beings are aware of the same time nexus' around Arrakis despite not all of them having access to the same data.  Paul's decisions and power of prescience actually muddles the fabric of spacetime to create nexuses of timelines that appear to Paul and the Guild as blind time. If the Guild is completely unaware of the existence of Paul, or a prescient ""calculator"" like themselves, how would they know to calculate him and generate the nexus in their minds? They shouldn't see a storm, whether that was the truth or not.

As said in the Appendix;

>The Guild hinted that its navigators, who use the spice drug on Arrakis to produce the limited prescience necassary for guiding spaceships through the void, were **""bothered about the future"" or saw ""problems on the horizon.**"" This could only mean **they saw a nexus, a meeting place of countless delicate decisions, beyond whcih the path was hidden from the prescient eye.** This was a clear indication that **some agency was interfering with higher order dimensions**  
...  
It was a known fact that Guild navigators **could predict no way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus**. The obvious conclusion was that **someone of higher order powers** ***was*** **taking control of the spice source**, yet the Bene Gesserit missed that point entirely!

The Guild senses ""disturbance"" around Arrakis because spacetime is becoming muddled there. The branches of possibilities and timelines are converging into a mess and they can detect that, the same as Paul can. Should prescient beings be just supercomputers, they should not be able to detect this disturbance in the way Paul does. His unknown decisions (and existence) should not weigh on their calculations and therefore they would not see a nexus. Not to mention the Guild simply lacks the mentat training to even calculate any of this. However, if they are also expanding their *awareness* to see the same spacial/temporal dimensions that Paul sees, then they would see the nexus the same nexus that Paul sees. They are then able to see the disturbances he creates within that web of timelines.

Paul weight on upper dimensions is what creates the blind time.

Every individual prescient being is perceiving the SAME spacetime. They only differ in how much of the spacetime they are able to comprehend. Therefore ""variables"" of data are unneeded to create the ""texture"" or ""landscape"" of time, or such as that as a nexus. The landscape of SPACEtime is the exact same for every prescientbeing. Just how much of it they can see is subjective. And major warpings of spacetime such as a nexus seems to be visible for ""everyone"".

Another aspect that I find interesting and at least to me, provides evidence that again, this is not just calculation, but Paul also sees the ""now"" at any geographic point of the universe. We see this when his prescience first awakens.

>**He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of inumerable unexplored crannies.**  
...  
**He saw new planets, new cultures.**  
**People.**  
People.  
**He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.**

Again, he sees that the Guild, Landsraad and the Emperor are above Arrakeen space.

>""You have seen the future, Paul,"" Jessica said. ""Will you say what you've seen?""

>""Not the future,"" he said. ""**I've seen the Now**."" He forced himself to a sitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. ""**The space above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild.""**

>Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.

>""The Padishah Emperor himself is there,"" Paul said. he looked at the rock ceiling of hiscell. ""with his favourite Truthsayer and five legions of Sardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside him and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster. Every Great House has its raiders above us...waiting.""

At this point Paul has unlocked his ancestral memory so I'm willing to accept the interpretation that he would known a lot of this from his almost unlimitted data on human behaviour and doing some mentat guess work to assume as such. He would also have access to some of the personalties of the Landsraad in his ancestral memeory that would straight up just tell him what they would have done, such as the Baron.

But.

I do think its interesting that Paul says ""the space above Arrakis is filled..."" rather than ""The ships are in space above us."" To me it reads as if Paul is implying that there is an emptiness being filled, rather than saying there are things in a place. As if Paul is perceiving the very depressions of space around the ships and people around him. That its not simple guess work or behavioural prediction, that Paul's *awareness* is fundementally, well, aware of what is going on in the very present moment.

Now that ends my discussion on prescience. But *awareness* isn't just highlighted to showcase prescience. No. Spice allows the user to extend their *awareness* to others around them, to the point of becoming ""one"". To feel another person's *awareness* and to share an empathic rapport. Not quite telepathy (you can lower your pitchforks) but not just the usual Bene Gesserit registering either.

When Jessica changes the poison into the Water of Life, her awareness expands. She and the tribe are suddenly able to become aware of each other's prescence in a way that is not exactly telepathy (Frank Herbet shouts that at us enough times), but something else.

>**""When the tribe shares the Water,"" she said, ""we're together - all of us. We...share. I can...sense the others with me, but I'm afraid to share with you.""**

>""Why?""

>...

>""There's something frightening in you,"" she said. ""When I took you away from the others..**.I did it because I could feel what the others wanted. You...press on people. You....make us see things!""**

It sems to be Frank Herbert's power system at least sits within the realm of the dualism, that mind (or conciousness/awareness) is seperate from the body and its physical limitation. That when spice is ingested, that one's conciousness actually expands past the confines of its body and can feel the awareness of another. The Water increases the strength of the tau, the tribe's hive-mind and shared-*awareness*, to the point that they can exchange at least some imagery, though some or all of it may just be prescience they're misunderstanding to be Paul sharing images in the shared-*awareness* by accident.

We see this in how the old Reverend Mother transfers her memories into Jessica

>The answer to this instant came like an explosion in her conciousness: her personal time was suspended to save her life.  
She focused on the **psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking inward.**  
....  
And there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness! Jessica tried to reject it, but the mote swept closer...closer.  
They touched!  
**It was like an ultimate simpatico, being two people at once, not teleapthy but mutual awareness.**  
*With the Old Reverend Mother!*  
But Jessica saw the Reverend Mother didn't think of herself as old. **An image unfolded before the mutual mind's eye, a young girl with a dancing spirit and tender humour.**  
**Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, ""Yes, that is how I am.""**  
Jessica could only accept the words, not respond to them.  
""You'll have it soon, Jessica,"" the inward image said.  
***This is a hallucination***\*\*, Jessica told herself\*\*  
**""You know better than that,"" the inward image said.**

The psychokinesthetic mote of Jessica, in my understanding, is refering to essentially the awareness Jessica has within her own mind and body. Almost like the singular point of where your conciousness sits.

During the Spice Agony, Jessica is able to *feel* the psychokinesthetic mote of another upon their physical touch. That of the old Reverend Mother. Herbert again, tells us this is not telepathy, but it *is* the shared connection of consiousness or *awareness*. She is passing empathic experiences to her, and on some level is able to communicate with her. Apparantly not telepathy, but whatever it is, Jessica is able to ""hear"" this woman from within her mote-awareness.

And then Jessica feels Alia's mote-awareness too.

>""...now....carefully, gently..**..touch your daughter-presence. Be your daughter-presence.** Absorb the fear...soothe...use your courage and your strength....gently now...gently...""  
The other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch it.  
Terror threatened to overwhelm her.  
She fought it in the only way she knew: ""*I shall not fear. Fear is the mind killer*...""  
***Words won't work***\*\*, Jessica told herself.\*\*  
**She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a warm snuggling of protection**.  
The terror receeded.  
Again, the presence of the old Reverend Mother assereted itself....  
""Time compels me,"" **the Reverend Mother said within the awareness.** ""I have much to give you.""

I think its interesting the difference in which Herbert formats the dialogue here. The Reverend Mother is speaking to Jessica as if it is aloud to be heard by Jessica, and does so from ""within the awareness"", aka, within the shared connection between the two women. But when Jessica tries to speak with Alia, it is only as a thought. This does not resonate with Alia until Jessica uses their shared empathic connection.

Again, these feats require something above just reading muslces and reactions. This is all occuring through the shareness *awareness* or *conciousness* between the three individuals.

Alia would later share what this experience was like from her perspective

>""Then **I saw a spark...but it wasn't exactly like seeing** it. The spark was just there with me and **I felt the spark's emotions**....soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was my mother.""

This is how Alia perceives another's mote-*awareness*. As a spark within her *awareness* with readable, or rather, feelable emotions.

I wondered if this was something only possible through Water, but then I got to this passage.

>The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her mother's hand. **The contact of flesh restored that mutual awarness** they had shared since before Alia's birth. **It wasn't a matter of shared thoughts - althought there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing the spice poison for the ceremony.** It was something larger, an immediate awareness of antoher living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve sympatico **that made them emotionally one.**

Jessica and Alia have an intimate emapthic connection on physical contact without the Water of Life. So I wonder if this is more in line with the abilities of a Reverend Mother. Both of them are also assumingly consuming spice regularly so its likely that the spice may also be helping their *awareness* expand into eachother.

But what I find most shockingly is that Herbert, in the only time in *Dune*, acknowledges a thing to be the ""sharing of thoughts"", that it *is* possible during a spice transmutation. That telepathy does somewhat exist...but I digress. In either case, it answers the query of how Jessica was able to ""hear"" the Reverend Mother's mote-*awareness*, that during the Water of Life there are bursts of thought but its not very good at two-way communication.

Paul is also able to connect to Jessica via ingesting the Water of Life through mote-awareness.

>He grabbed her hand, faced her with death's head grin, and **he sent his awareness surging over her.**  
The rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern...but it was a rapport: **a sense-sharing of the entire being**. It shook her, weakened her, and she cowered in her mind, fearful of him.

Jessica would continue to show Paul ""the place in which Bene Gesserit don't look"" and he sees it through their shared awareness. Again, this is a clear example of the idea of *awareness* extending and being received by another individual through the use of spice. It allows for an empathic connection between two people, and in some instances, the sharing of thougths. In either case, Jessica is able to both receive and share images with the person she has the rapport with if there is Water in their system.

Lastly I want to have a look at exactly, what the hell was going on between Alia and Reverend Mother Gaius Mohiam. I've seen this has been the subject of a lot of discussion and confusion, including myself from when I've seen people discuss it.

Lets take it step by step.

>The old woman pointed a finger at Alia. **""Get out of my mind!""**

>""T-P?"" the emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. ""By the Great Mother!""

>""You do not understand, Majesty,"" the old woman said. **""Not telepathy. She's in my mind. She's like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!""**

The obvious confusion here lies in that Alia is both not using telepathy, yet is somehow within Mohiam's mind ""like the others.""

My instant thought, as it appears it was the same for everyone, is that Mohiam is implying that Alia's personality within her ancestral memory has awoken and they are related in some way (please no spoilers). However, the obvious issue here is that since Alia was born after Mohiam, that Alia should NOT exist within her ancestral memory. This is infact, impossible.

Instead, I think its more likely that Mohiam is describing something more akin to shared-*awareness*. Something she likely has experienced before with past RM which is why she says ""like the ones before me"". Mohiam is also adamant that it is not telepathy, and never implies that Alia is actually speaking to her. She only says that Alia is ""standing"" in her mind. This sounds a lot more like shared-*awareness*.

There's a few issues with this theory though.

1. Jessica and the RM shared-awareness required phyiscal touch.
   1. Required the Water to share images/thoughts
2. Alia's and Jessica's shared awareness required physical touch
   1. Required the Water to share thoughts
3. Paul's and Jessica's shared-awareness required phyiscal touch
   1. Required the Water to share images

Alia is very clearly, not touching Mohiam.

So the only way for non-physical shared-awareness to be possible here is that it be more akin to how the Frement opperate under their ""tau"" or hive mind that requires no phyiscal touch. That Alia has somehow manually engaged in this.

>...She thought of the coffee and it had appeared. **There was nothing of telepathy here**, she knew. **It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice** diet they shared. **The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single orgaism.**

>And the thoguht of coincidence never entereed their minds.

It is likely that Mohiam does eat at least some amount of spice, probably nothing compared to Alia or the Fremen, but it could be possible that her awareness is perked up to feel a presence (or *awareness*) such as that as Alia. Still it's possibly one way that Alia made herself present in Mohiam's mind.

The Fremen are also not conciouslly aware that they are sharing-*awareness* with one another as Jessica notes. They do not have the training that she does and thus, perhaps this is implication that RMs can share-*awareness* in a more direct and intimate approach that does not require physical touch. That the Fremen are not a good example of what the capabilities of tau would look like fully actualised. That what the Fremen require the Water of Life for, the RM can do without it.

Lets keep reading.

>""You babble, old woman,"" Alia said. ""you don't see how it was, yet you rattle on like a purblind fool."" **Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it.**

>**The old Reverend Mother groanded and staggered.**

>**Alia opened her eyes. ""That is how it was,"" she said. ""A cosmic accident...and you played your part in it.""**

>The old Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushign the air toward Alia.

>""What is happening here?"" the Emperor demanded. **""Child can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another?""**

>**""That is not how it is at all,"" Alia said. ""Unless I'm born as you, I cannot think as you.""**

Here we see Alia very clearly trying to communicate something to Mohiam via non-verbal means. She closes her eyes and concentrates, the effects of which physically and mentally effect Mohiam. When Alia opens her eyes, she speaks as if she's just shown or told Mohiam something.

Again, Herbert screams at us that this is NOT telepathy.

Like Jessica did for Paul, and as the Fremen RM did for Jessica, it could be that through shared awareness that Alia only showed Mohiam images of how it came to be that Alia was born. This potentially could be done through the tau, though we've only seen characters do image sharing via physical touch (and likely aided with the Water of Life).

>""Silence,"" the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. **""Child, can you communicate with your brother?""**

>**""My brother knows I'm here,"" Alia said.**

>""Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?""

>Alia smiled up at him with clear innoncence. **""I shall not do that,"" she said.**

>...

>""You will not, eh? **Can you read in my mind what I'll do if you disobey me?""**

>**""I've already said I cannot read minds,"" she said,** ""but one doesn't need telepathy to read your intentions.""

I find the use of Alia's wording here interesting. When the Emperor asks if she can communicate to Paul, with the implication of it being through mystical means, Alia doesn't say that she ""can't"", she says that she ""won't"".

The assumption here is that Alia can absolutely communicate to Paul through mysticsm. She just can't do it through telepathy (this power does not exist in the *Dune* universe). So maybe if we find out how she communicates to Paul, we will know how she communicates with Mohiam

>Paul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he had once watied to mourn his father. Now he gave his thoughts over to the day's accumulated discoveries - the mixed futures and **the hidden** ***presence*** **of Alia within his awareness.**

>**Of all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest**. **""I have breasted the future to place my words where only you can hear them,"" Alia had said. ""Even you cannot do that, my brother.** I find it an interesting play. And...oh, yes - I've killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain.""

>Silence. His time sense had seen her withdrawl.

This is sort of a big deal.

Prescient people cannot see other prescient people. Yet Alia is able to see Paul enough that she can predict the futures he will scan and make herself visible to him so that she may lay words out for him to read.

I'm sure you can fundementally write up how this works with the mindset of just adding probabilities, but to me this level of prescience requires the complete perception of spacetime. That Alia was manipulating futures (Paul mentions earlier that he can ""test and probe"" probabiltieis) so that Paul would be able to find it in his own prescient eye. That perhaps they were perceiving the same higher dimension landscape whereby Alia can leave Paul a message. Like writing in sand so that another may find it.

I have yet to read *Messiah*, but I'm told that Mohiam is implied to have limited prescience. If so, this is absolutely how Alia may have communicated with her throughout the passage. The whole reveal of this power almost feels like its ""meant"" to explain this moment with Mohiam (and why Alia would imply she can communicate with Paul if she's not a telepath).

Personally I'm not entirely happy with this explanation.

For Mohiam to describe Alia's invasion as to ""stand within her mind"", and that it was in ""the same way as the others before her"", I would assume there would have to be some shared-*awareness* between the two, rather than prescient communication.

So for me, personally. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. Perhaps Alia was sharing-*awareness* with Mohiam, and considering she's capable of a feat such as *prescient-talk*, that perhaps she also is able to project *awareness* and imagery without physical touch. But I'm also willing to accept that Alia was sharing the imagery through prescient-talk. But that the initial connection was via shared-*awareness.*

**TL;DR:**

**Herbert roots awareness and prescience into the concept of mind-body dualism and mysticsm, not logical reasoning and probability calculations.**

**Prescience is the result of the spice awakening the mind to higher order dimensions of spacetime, allowing the viewer to ""see"" the fourth and fifth dimension. This power exists independently from the logical reasoning and training of a mentat.**

**Prescient beings do not do their own individual calcuations to predict the future with various different variables that would change future events. They both individually perceive the ""same"" spacetime and then interpret it in the ways that their minds are capable of handling.  This is why the Guild Navigators are limited as they do not have the training or genetic predisposition that Paul has to compute the data required to comprehend mutliple timelines, or to see far into the past or future. They can only interpret a much smaller amount of spacetime.**

**Paul's training and genetic disposition as a mentat, bene gesserit and access to ancestral mememory allows him to glimpse further and deeper into the fabric of spacetime. The understanding and context his background grants him over what he perceives is what allows him his prescience to grow to be as vast as it is.**

**Alia's seemingly ""psychic"" communication with Mohiam is not psychic or due to ancestral memory. Alia is sharing her** ***awareness*** **with Mohiam in a manner in which she does with Jessica or in which the Fremen share** ***awareness*** **with each other. It may also (or instead) be similar to how Alia can communicate to Paul via** ***prescient-talk***.",6,1729882272.0,dune,0,0.88,False

One thing we have to have is decent coffee. For most Vegas hotels, there's no coffee maker in the room - they want you to wander down to the casino floor for crap coffee at Starbucks (at a markup) or whatever. Our solution a portable immersion boiler and a pour-over coffee maker.

The immersion boiler is basically an electric heating element for boiling water. It's very portable and very durable -- and cheap. We used it heat water in a tin cup like you use for camping - also very light and basically indestructible. Put the boiler in, plug it and wait for it to boil. Then fill the pour-over with ground coffee and slowly pour in the hot water. We bring a ziplock with ground coffee and coffee filters from home on every trip. Now you have very strong, good coffee for basically the price of ground coffee and a filter.

Next, how to keep things cold? These places never have microwaves, so heating up stuff is not possible - but every hotel has an ice maker. We'd usually but things that are good cold - think milk (for coffee), cheese, smoked meat, leftovers, drinks,  etc. Take the bag that comes with your ice bucket and fill it with ice. Snatch a few other bags from the maid cart. These bags are usually clean and don't have holes. Fill one with ice from the ice maker. Put the food/drinks you want to keep cold in the other bag(s). Put the ice on top of the food bag, and put the whole bunch in the shower. Then put an extra towel or two on top. Your food bag will stay quite cold, and as the ice melts the water will go to the drain. You'll probably have to replace the ice bag daily, but it'll keep your stuff plenty cold.

EDIT: so many good tips here! We usually travel with one suitcase, so space/weight is precious. But the coolers area a good idea, worth it if there's a store to buy it there than discard.

The boilder/pour over I picked on amazon are just examples, I'm sure there's cheaper/better options. We bought ours way back in the pre-covid days.",0,1729882263.0,preppers,6,0.46,False

Echoes of the Past

I'm not sure if I‚Äôll even be able to finish these lines. Maybe no one will ever read this; maybe it's just a final log. But if someone finds it, I hope it will serve at least as a warning. My name doesn‚Äôt matter. What‚Äôs important is what happened in Teotihuac√°n three months ago.

I traveled with a group of archaeologists to the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon to gather material for my new book. As a horror and science fiction writer, places steeped in history like these are perfect for finding inspiration‚Äînot because I believe in the supernatural, but because the atmosphere is captivating. I expected nothing more than ancient stones and well-documented facts. If only I hadn‚Äôt been so naive, I would have taken the warnings more seriously. If I had known what awaited me, I would never have gone there. Now, my only hope is that someone learns from my mistakes‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs too late. Our group, apart from myself, consisted of four people: two women and two men. I won‚Äôt use their real names here.

The two women, Julia and Mey, were students of Professor Garden and Professor Schmitt. Garden, a professor of bioarchaeology and ethnoarchaeology, and Schmitt, an expert in religious symbolism, made the perfect team for an author like me to write a compelling book. I was assured that the two young women were outstanding young researchers. I had no objections to them joining us. Now, looking back, I wish I had stopped them from coming. When we arrived at our vacation home in San Juan Teotihuac√°n in mid-November, we discussed our approach.

Garden, ever the concerned scout, warned me sternly, ‚ÄúNever leave the path and always step exactly where I step.‚Äù You‚Äôd think we were on a safari surrounded by hungry lions, not on an archaeological excursion. Still, I nodded dutifully so he‚Äôd relax. Schmitt, on the other hand, was even more dramatic. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch anything,‚Äù he said, holding up a finger as if warning us about the end of the world. ‚ÄúYou never know what might lurk inside these pyramids.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but grin. ‚ÄúOh, really? The spirits of the dead? Or perhaps the gods, waiting to be resurrected?‚Äù Mey, who had been quiet until then, suddenly stood up. ‚ÄúYou should listen to Professor Schmitt. Several people have already disappeared without a trace in these pyramids.‚Äù Her serious expression was hard to miss, but the hint of panic in her voice was almost amusing. Julia, the calmest of us all, slipped away quietly as Mey lost her composure. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre just here for your new book, but maybe you should listen to those who actually know what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù I stared at her for a moment before Schmitt cut her off with a firm, ‚ÄúMey, that‚Äôs enough!‚Äù She crossed her arms, gave a quick nod, muttered angrily, and disappeared into her room, slamming the door behind her.

Schmitt shrugged apologetically. ‚ÄúForgive her. She‚Äôs talented but still too emotional for this line of work.‚Äù Well, that I could agree with. Still, to satisfy my curiosity, I asked, ‚ÄúAnd what would you advise, Professor?‚Äù Schmitt let out a heavy sigh. ‚ÄúAs I told you over the phone: Leave it alone. Abandon this before whatever lies here is awakened.‚Äù ‚ÄúSchmitt,‚Äù I said with a smile, ""I have no intention of awakening anything‚Äîlet alone canceling. I'm not a superstitious person. There are no ghosts, gods, or other hocus-pocus for me. I write about horror because it sells well, not because I believe in it. My readers expect an exciting story, and that's what I'll give them, with your help. So, tell me something you haven't already advised.""

""More than what I've already advised, I won‚Äôt say. Places like these are different from the reality we know, but fine‚Äîthen I just hope nothing happens,"" he muttered grimly and withdrew.

I stayed sitting with Garden for a while longer. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said after some time. ""I believe in ghosts just as little as you do. The only real dangers are poisonous animals and diseases we‚Äôre vaccinated against. So, stay on the path. We want to avoid running into any venomous creatures, even though that‚Äôs easier said than done.""

""You're absolutely right, Garden."" Then he asked me, ""But honestly, how did you manage to get Schmitt to come here? He seems rather reserved, even reluctant when it comes to trips like these.""

I looked him in the eye. ""He owed me a favor.""

""And what kind of favor, exactly?""

I gave a slight smile. ""I'm sorry, Garden, but that‚Äôs none of your business."" I stood up and left him alone in the living room.

The reason Schmitt was here wasn‚Äôt something I could tell him. Schmitt was indebted to me because I‚Äôd served as his alibi more than once for his extramarital affairs. That was my leverage, and it had worked. I know it‚Äôs not the most honorable way, but that‚Äôs how business goes. Without these little tricks, I‚Äôd never have been able to write my book. Though‚Äîunfortunately, I suppose I‚Äôll never get around to writing it all down. Anyway, I should continue with the events rather than digressing into less important details.

Early the next morning, we set off with our equipment and provisions toward the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon; who knew if we‚Äôd be back at our lodgings before nightfall? Garden drove our Jeep to ensure we didn‚Äôt stray off course‚Äîhis mothering was honestly irritating, but his knowledge was undeniably useful, especially since he knew this place so well, thanks to his somewhat tiresome hobby. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice through the rearview mirror just how tense and sullen Schmitt and Mey were during the drive. They still hadn‚Äôt digested the previous evening, nor my opinions on the whole nonsense. Anyway, giving further attention to their moods would be a complete waste of time.

We reached the pyramid site in under ten minutes. On arrival, we were greeted by security guards, and I promptly showed them our permit for the excursion. They let us through to the Avenue of the Dead, which we drove along to reach the Pyramid of the Sun. During this, Garden began eagerly explaining some facts about the place. ""For your information, we‚Äôre currently on the Avenida de los Muertos, or Avenue of the Dead. It was part of the central axis of the ancient city. The road itself runs only from south to north and was developed between roughly the 1st and 7th centuries AD. The residential areas date from 100 to 650 AD, which was the peak period for this fascinating place."" His enthusiastic rambling didn‚Äôt interest me in the slightest, though I did note down the dates he mentioned‚Äîfacts like these might come in handy, after all. To the regret of my ears, my notes only spurred him on further, causing him to slow down and gesture animatedly. He behaved like an overexcited tour guide. ‚ÄúThe Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, along with the Avenue of the Dead, were first archaeologically examined in the 19th century. The Pyramid of the Sun was even systematically excavated in 1905 under the direction of Leopold Batres. Incredibly fascinating, don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù The question was rhetorical, as he didn‚Äôt give us time to respond. ‚ÄúI admire his work, even though it was risky.‚Äù While he raved on, my gaze fell on the elaborate frescoes and wall paintings in the abandoned residential buildings. The details captivated me, especially since nothing had been restored. But one mural, which I glimpsed from the corner of my eye on a crumbling wall, struck me as odd: a faded figure with a sewn-up mouth. Garden cleared his throat, pulling my attention away from the image. ‚ÄúForgive me, I‚Äôd better continue. The Pyramid of the Moon, at the northern end of the Avenue of the Dead, was explored more intensively in 1960, and the entire ruins complex has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987. Although it‚Äôs smaller than the Pyramid of the Sun, it‚Äôs more imposing due to its structure.‚Äù Garden‚Äôs speech roused Schmitt‚Äôs flow of words as well. Now came the part I found interesting. ‚ÄúThat may be, dear colleague Schmitt, but the religious meanings and rituals are at least as fascinating as the structures.‚Äù While Schmitt continued, Garden parked the jeep near the Pyramid of the Sun, and we got out. I noticed Mey‚Äôs awe-struck yet nervous expression and inwardly rolled my eyes. Everyone has their fears, I thought, but being afraid of ancient ruins seemed silly to me. They‚Äôre just stones stacked up to create something magnificent. Schmitt continued, ‚ÄúThe Pyramid of the Sun, also known as the Pyramid de Sol, was used for sacrificial offerings to honor the gods. ""She is perfectly aligned with the sunset at the summer solstice and is likely dedicated to the sun god. She symbolizes the ascent to the divine plane.""

""Divine plane?"" I asked, looking up from my notes at Schmitt. I was far more interested in the religious aspects than in facts about excavations and heritage status. Not that I believed any of it, of course‚Äîbut places like this were ideal in books.

""I thought you didn't believe in such nonsense?""

""Schmitt,"" I sighed, ""this isn't about what I believe. It's about what I can use for my book. It's compelling, and that‚Äôs what matters.""

He crossed his arms, assuming a defensive, almost disdainful stance. But he hadn‚Äôt anticipated what came next.

With a trembling voice she could barely control, Mey began to speak.

""The divine planes represent creation and renewal. That's why cave systems were built under the pyramid. People often say these systems were for rites to the underworld, but that‚Äôs not entirely true. They were more like the birthplace of the universe, where rituals of healing were performed. People invoked the powers of divine beings to gain healing for their afflictions.""

As I scribbled down Mey‚Äôs explanations, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder. Why was this usually fiery young woman suddenly so subdued and compliant? Even Schmitt looked at her, stunned. I chose to ignore her change in demeanor‚Äîhad I only chosen differently.

""And where exactly would the entrance to this cave system be? It would be fascinating to see it with my own eyes to better capture it in writing.""

""No!"" Schmitt suddenly shouted.

""Why shouldn‚Äôt we take a look?"" I asked. Garden folded his arms.

""As far as I know, everything has been secured to avoid accidents.""

""These weren‚Äôt accidents; they were punishments and warnings,"" Schmitt cried, as if it was his last chance to convince us, staring at Garden with a warning look. But Garden only responded with a disapproving look. ‚ÄúEnough, Schmitt! Stop it! You‚Äôre just spreading unnecessary fear!‚Äù

‚ÄúColleague Garden, I‚Äôm not scaring anyone‚ÄîI‚Äôm stating facts. We shouldn‚Äôt be here, and if we don‚Äôt leave immediately, this will be the end of us!‚Äù Schmitt‚Äôs gaze was filled with both anger and panic. Before the situation could escalate further, I stepped between the two of them. Someone had to put an end to the argument to ensure my plan wasn‚Äôt put at risk.

‚ÄúCalm down, gentlemen! Schmitt, you and Mey don‚Äôt have to come along. Garden, do you know the way to the cave system?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúGood, then you both stay here while we go down.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt touch anything.‚Äù

Schmitt‚Äôs voice, filled with panic, dropped to a whisper: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so sure! We may have already awakened something just by being here!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Schmitt, just stay here with Mey!‚Äù I turned and headed into the Pyramid of the Sun with Garden and Julia. Garden instructed Julia to take notes since this would likely be relevant to her thesis. These constant warnings were starting to get on my nerves. In my opinion, Schmitt should consider seeing a therapist so he wouldn‚Äôt lose himself in such nonsense.

As we entered the pyramid with our lanterns and approached the cave system, an uneasy feeling crept over me, as if we were being watched. But I dismissed it as a product of Schmitt‚Äôs exaggerated fears, chalking it up to imagination. Julia followed, notebook in hand, as Garden confidently led us toward the cave system. The structure of the system surprised me: an entrance led first into an antechamber. The room and tunnels were bathed in a faint light, making it easy to see even without a lantern. From there, four narrow passages branched off, likely serving as changing rooms or quarters. The fifth, wider corridor led us into what Garden called the prayer hall‚Äîor at least, that's what he called it. ""Prayer hall"" sounded far too reverent for someone like him in my ears. The space was a precisely hollowed dome with a circular floor, and I was amazed at the precision of ancient construction. To be honest, it was almost too precise. In the center of the room was an elongated altar, surrounded by Aztec symbols that were engraved or painted into the floor. The pillars supporting the room were also adorned with these symbols. Around us stood incomplete light fixtures and pitchers, some whole and some broken. I described the scene as accurately as possible in my notes‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs not every day you come across such a perfect setting for a dark novel.

Garden approached the altar and examined it. ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs actually a prayer to the sun god here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you read it, Garden? I'd love to note it down. Prayers like these are incredibly useful.‚Äù My eyes lit up with excitement.

Garden laughed. ‚ÄúOf course, but I can‚Äôt decipher all of it. The script is quite faded. I‚Äôll read aloud whatever I can make out.‚Äù Garden traced his fingertips over the altar‚Äôs stone.

*""O mighty Tezcatlipoca, you who light up the heavens,*  
*Hear our pleas‚Ä¶ behold the offerings we lay before you.*  
*You who drink the blood of warriors to hold the sky aloft,*  
*Accept this sacrifice‚Ä¶ that the eternal fire may burn.*  
*With our blood, we nourish you, so you remain strong,*  
*So that you may continue to uphold the heavens.*  
*... Great Tonatiuh, lord of the sun realm,*  
*‚Ä¶ bestow mercy‚Ä¶ and strength.*

*‚Ä¶ Let the fields thrive, hearts grow strong‚Ä¶*  
*Keep at bay the cold and darkness‚Ä¶*  
*For you we sacrifice‚Ä¶ for you we fight‚Ä¶*  
*So that you grant us‚Ä¶ divine light.""*

Fascinated, I listened to Garden‚Äôs words, even though they sounded choppy and oddly distorted. Suddenly, a low rumble echoed, and small stones fell to the ground. Garden and I snapped out of our trance, looking around, but we couldn‚Äôt see anything. What the hell was that? I turned to Garden.

‚ÄúWhat was that rumble?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I think it was just the earth; after all, the earth is always moving.‚Äù

‚ÄúMakes sense,‚Äù I replied, turning away. As I did, I noticed a book and pen on the ground.

‚ÄúGarden!‚Äù I called, pointing to the items. He went over and picked them up.

‚ÄúThese are Julia‚Äôs things!‚Äù His eyes filled with fear and worry as he asked, ‚ÄúDid you see Julia leave?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Garden. Maybe she got startled by the noise, dropped her things, and ran out.‚Äù

Garden nodded, as if everything were happening in slow motion. Together, we headed outside, where Schmitt and Mey were leaning against the Jeep, waiting for us. Garden‚Äôs gaze lingered on Julia‚Äôs belongings. Schmitt noticed us, jumped up immediately, and hurried over.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúDid Julia pass by you?‚Äù

Schmitt shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. Did you touch anything down there?‚Äù

Garden glared at him angrily, snapping, ‚ÄúEnough, Schmitt! That‚Äôs enough! My student is missing, and the only thing you can think of is whether we touched something down there.‚Äù

Schmitt stared at him, stunned. ‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

Mey cut him off. ‚ÄúMaybe we missed Julia. You two were down there for a long time, and in the meantime, we were resting in the Jeep.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best thing we can do now is to head back to our accommodation. She might have run there.‚Äù Garden's eyes lit up. ‚ÄúThank you, Mey. Let‚Äôs go, maybe we can still find her.‚Äù He ran to the jeep, and as soon as we took our seats, he sped off. In less than three minutes, we arrived at the accommodation. Unfortunately, we hadn‚Äôt seen her on the way. As we parked in front of our place, Garden rushed inside to search for her. I understood why he was worried, but I would have expected this reaction from someone in love. Mey, Schmitt, and I followed him more slowly, helping him search, even though the accommodation wasn‚Äôt very big. After a few minutes of searching and calling, we found ourselves in the small living room. Garden looked sadly down at the floor while Mey looked at him sympathetically. Schmitt, on the other hand, crossed his arms. ‚ÄúI told you we shouldn‚Äôt have come here!‚Äù His snappy tone threw Garden off, and he punched Schmitt in the face. ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU?! MY STUDENT HAS DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE, AND YOU, YOU LITTLE BASTARD, HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TALK BACK!‚Äù Schmitt fell to the ground, staring at Garden, rubbing his cheek and gritting his teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying how it is.‚Äù That sentence was enough for Garden to start beating him up. Mey shouted desperately, ‚ÄúProfessor Garden, leave him alone! He has no compassion; it has nothing to do with you. Really!‚Äù However, Garden didn‚Äôt listen to her and knocked Schmitt unconscious before I could pull him away. Luckily, I was stronger and a bit taller than Garden; otherwise, I could never have held him back. Mey took Schmitt to his room while Garden struggled. ‚ÄúLET ME GO!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúNo, Garden, that‚Äôs enough! You‚Äôve already beaten Schmitt unconscious, and that happened in just a few moments, and‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT CARE, HE DESERVED IT! HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT JULIA‚ÄôS DISAPPEARANCE!‚Äù ‚ÄúNOW LISTEN TO ME, GARDEN!‚Äù He flinched. I rarely yelled, but when no one listened to me, I had no choice. ‚ÄúDo you seriously want to be responsible for a murder?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚ÄîNo, of course not.‚Äù He relaxed enough for me to let him go. ‚ÄúIf you had continued to hit him, Schmitt could have died at worst.‚Äù Garden turned to me and stared. ‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it can. You should rest and apologize to Schmitt tomorrow!‚Äù Garden nodded, dazed, and walked, slightly swaying, to his room.

Sighing, I sank onto the small sofa. My gaze was frozen on the carpet in front of me. What was going on? First Mey's transformation and now Garden's? My thoughts wouldn‚Äôt let me be. Was Schmitt right after all? I shook my head to dispel that thought. He couldn't be right; such a thing was impossible. Gods and curses don‚Äôt exist. There had to be a rational explanation for the change. With Garden, Julia's disappearance was the trigger for his aggression; I was sure of that. But with Mey, I couldn't explain it. Maybe she had a change of heart when she thought about Schmitt's words from the night before. I lay down on the sofa and stared at the ceiling. These changes, as confusing and bad as they were, gave me wonderful material. A drama in a horror book. That would create the necessary connection between the reader and the character. A smile crept across my lips. The feeling of happiness washed over me; my book would write itself. It was perfect. I jumped up one more time to take notes, making sure not to forget anything. Fortunately, I could count myself lucky that none of the others caught me doing it. I couldn't imagine the serious consequences this would have, other than the immediate termination of this endeavor. I fell back onto the sofa with my notes, got comfortable, and closed my eyes. With that, I tried once more to reflect on everything, not wanting to forget any detail. However, before I could jot down anything further, fatigue overwhelmed me, and I fell asleep. The next morning, I was startled awake by a warm breath on my face. It took me a moment to realize who was standing before me. It was Julia. I stared at her, but she looked at me with a cold, vacant expression. ‚ÄúJ-Julia, you scared me! Where did you come from, and where have you been? Garden was worried about you!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is Professor Garden?‚Äù Her voice sounded different. No longer soft like before, but strangely distorted, as if someone else were trying to speak with her voice. Instinctively, I recoiled from her. She tilted her head and stared at me. A brief cough escaped her throat, and she spoke again, but now it sounded like it had before: ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúY-yes, of course. He should still be sleeping upstairs.‚Äù She walked past me without another word, heading up to Garden. I watched her go, still shocked by what I had heard. But then I saw it. For the briefest moment, her left hand changed. Her nails were sharp claws for the blink of an eye. I shook my head and dismissed it as an illusion caused by fatigue. Shortly afterward, just as I was about to treat myself to a cup of coffee, Schmitt, Mey, Garden, and Julia came downstairs. They were wildly discussing where Julia had been. ‚ÄúWhere were you, Julia?‚Äù Garden raised his voice, but the concern in his eyes was unmistakable. Julia looked at him as if she were trying to process his words, but her lips only formed a quiet, almost toneless ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Her eyes were empty, as if something had drained her soul. ‚ÄúI... got lost. Nothing more,‚Äù she added softly, but there was an uncertainty in her gaze that everyone in the room could feel. ‚ÄúI found my way back here this morning.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be all there was, Julia!‚Äù Garden‚Äôs voice interrupted the others. She looked at him, ‚ÄúBut that was everything, and now please let‚Äôs drop this subject. I‚Äôm back. Isn‚Äôt that all that matters?‚Äù With this question, one could have thought she truly had no idea if that was all that counted. ‚ÄúY-yes, of course, but I was worried about you.‚Äù ‚ÄúForgive me, Professor Garden, I didn‚Äôt mean to.‚Äù Garden just nodded. Now in hindsight, thinking about it, I should have noticed at that moment that something was wrong. We left Julia alone for the rest of the day with our questions and instead prepared for the next expedition. However, I was under the impression that this would take place the following day. Julia began to insist tirelessly around 5 PM that we visit the Moon Pyramid at dusk. Her voice sounded strangely urgent, almost alien. ‚ÄúThe true magic of this site,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúcan only be seen when the veil of night falls over the pyramid.‚Äù It was as if something was speaking through her‚Äînot her. Garden and Schmitt exchanged uncertain glances, but in the end, we agreed. The signs were becoming clearer, but I was too curious and, like the others, caught in a current. Too fascinated and far too blinded, for after that evening, chaos would erupt. We took the same path as the day before and arrived at the Moon Pyramid. In the twilight, it looked incredibly majestic. In the same breath, we got out and all went inside the pyramid. As soon as I set foot inside, I was overwhelmed by a suffocating and uneasy feeling. It wasn‚Äôt like at the Sun Pyramid, the feeling of being watched; it was more oppressive, like an additional burden. We walked a few steps further in, which intensified the suffocating feeling, and my steps slowed. My legs became heavy, and I struggled to move. My breathing became labored, and I fell to my knees. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that Garden and Schmitt were experiencing the same thing before everything went black. Garden, Schmitt, Mey, and I seemed to regain consciousness simultaneously, as we all looked around in confusion. We found ourselves in a chamber deep underground, and as I assumed, beneath the Moon Pyramid. Perhaps even beneath the cave system. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù The question that circled in all our minds broke the silence first with Garden‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. This place is completely unfamiliar to me. Besides, it‚Äôs hard to say where we are with so little visibility,‚Äù Schmitt replied with a sigh. A deep, slightly metallic laugh made us flinch. We couldn‚Äôt pinpoint where it came from, but we didn‚Äôt have to search for long. Unnatural bluish-black lights flickered on around us, starting from where we were until they closed the circle in front of us. At first, it was difficult to orient ourselves in this light. The room resembled an earthen cave until we realized what we were sitting on. A scream escaped the throats of those present. We were sitting on corpses ‚Äì not an ordinary floor, but a tangle of decaying bodies and rotting limbs that crunched beneath us. Bones jutted out like broken spears from the flesh, some so old that they were gray and brittle. Other bodies, still fresh, collapsed under our movements, and a disgusting rush of putrid blood burst from their open wounds. The sharp stench of decay and rotten flesh burned in my throat, mingled with a hint of burnt flesh and something ‚Äì was it stomach acid? How could we not have noticed the smell? It didn‚Äôt just smell of rotten meat but also of something undefinable, like a mix of wet dog, burnt flesh, and stomach acid. Garden and Schmitt promptly vomited. Mey and I, however, seemed to have relatively robust stomachs despite our nausea. The laughter rang out again, and we turned to the source of the sound. My breath caught, and my eyes widened. Julia stood there, laughing and drooling. ‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, JULIA?! WHERE ARE WE?‚Äù Garden shouted at her. Julia only grinned, looking at us hungrily. Garden was just about to take a breath when a growl emerged from her throat. ‚ÄúI am not Julia.‚Äù We stared at her, disbelief written all over our faces as we processed what was happening. Julia's body twisted and contorted in impossible ways. Her bones cracked as her arms elongated, and her fingers stretched into claws that seemed hungry for flesh. The skin on her back ripped open, while dense patches of fur burst forth from the wounds, and her legs broke backward with a disgusting crack, like those of a predator. Her face contorted into a cruel snout that opened wide to reveal a row of unnaturally long, needle-sharp teeth‚Äîa greedy grin that craved destruction. These enormous, unnatural teeth resembled those of sharks crossed with tigers. Unable to say anything, we simply stared. Its tongue slid over its teeth before it began speaking again in its rasping, growling voice. ‚ÄúI brought you here because my master commanded me to hunt you.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúI am hungry, so I hunt what is allowed to me.‚Äù Schmitt swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am a kind of Wendigo, but smarter than my kin. I would have preferred to kill you outright, but my master commanded otherwise.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you telling us this?‚Äù Mey‚Äôs voice broke with her tears as she asked. ‚ÄúMy master loves to see how you humans despair during my hunt.‚Äù The Wendigo looked into Mey‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving you a little head start.‚Äù We stared at it as it continued. ‚ÄúThe hallway behind you brings you closer to the exit, and if you‚Äôre still sitting here in ten minutes, I‚Äôll tear you apart right here.‚Äù Garden shouted, ‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT DO THA‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúBUT I CAN!‚Äù it growled angrily, ‚Äúand now I suggest you run, or I will tear you apart immediately!‚Äù That thing only needed to say it once. We ran down the hallway it indicated. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get very far. Behind us, we first heard a crack, then a tearing sound. Schmitt screamed. He had fallen into a trap behind us and was lying on the ground, screaming. The trap had completely crushed one of his legs and torn off the other. Garden and I were frozen in shock while Mey tried to administer first aid. She shouted desperately at us, ‚ÄúSTOP STANDING AROUND LIKE IDIOTS AND HELP HIM!‚Äù Her voice broke us from our stupor, and we dragged Schmitt with us, hoping to escape. However, we didn‚Äôt get as far as we had hoped. A growl echoed like thunder through the halls. We froze as panic crawled up inside us. Schmitt gasped, ‚ÄúLeave‚Ä¶ me‚Ä¶ behind!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, we can‚Äôt do that, Professor,‚Äù Mey said, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúYes, you must,‚Äù he wheezed, gasping for air. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt last much longer‚Ä¶ If that Wendigo‚Ä¶ eats me‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll have time to escape.‚Äù Garden saw this as a sign, let go of Schmitt, and ran. Mey and I stared at Garden in shock as he disappeared. Schmitt pushed me away and fell to the ground. ‚ÄúNow get out of here!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you have to come with us! Who will teach us so well otherwise, Professor?‚Äù Mey grabbed his arms and pulled, but Schmitt pushed her away too and looked at me with lifeless eyes. ‚ÄúGet my student out of here and survive.‚Äù I stared into his eyes, which resembled those of a blind person. ‚ÄúNOW GO!‚Äù My body flinched at his shout, and I reached for Mey. She squirmed and resisted as I dragged her with me. ‚ÄúLET ME GO!! WE CAN‚ÄôT LEAVE SCHMITT ALONE. WE CAN STILL SAVE HIM, DAMMIT!‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his wish, Mey,‚Äù she sobbed. ‚ÄúBut he can‚Äôt die.‚Äù  
‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt respect his wish, we will all die, Mey!‚Äù She stared at me in disbelief and let herself be led away. ‚ÄúThe other problem is that Garden is nowhere to be found, and our chances of survival have plummeted.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even know why I could stay calm in that moment after being so paralyzed with shock. My eyes tried to adjust to the darkness, even though the dim light made it more difficult. It was as if this light was meant to take away one‚Äôs sight rather than give it. After a while, Mey began to walk again, and we wandered through the hallways until we heard a tearing sound followed by a scream. The blood in our veins froze, and we ran. We ran until we could run no more and had to catch our breath.  
‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? JUST GET OUT!‚Äù Schmitt shouted at us. I swallowed hard and stared at Schmitt‚Äôs silhouette. How could this be? We had run away from him. Or had we not? I was no longer sure about anything. Is this what it feels like to lose touch with reality? I stared at him, pale.  
‚ÄúDAMN IT, RUN ALREADY!‚Äù  
‚ÄúW-we were,‚Äù I stammered and couldn‚Äôt get another sound out of my throat.  
‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to go back to them, Professor,‚Äù Mey looked at him. ‚ÄúWe heard that Wendigo tear someone apart, and I thought it was you, so we ran in the opposite direction. But somehow‚Ä¶‚Äù She faltered. ‚ÄúWe should keep going.‚Äù  
I looked at her in disbelief but nodded in agreement. Schmitt stared at us wordlessly as we left him again. I understood nothing anymore. How could we end up back with Schmitt despite everything, and why didn‚Äôt we trigger any traps? We continued wandering through the hallways until we found a staircase. I was just about to take the stairs when Mey stopped me. ‚ÄúAre you sure this ascent will lead us to freedom?‚Äù  
‚ÄúMey, I‚Äôm a writer, not a researcher, archaeologist, or anything like that. I don‚Äôt know, but since we‚Äôre deep underground, I think it brings us closer to our freedom.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be so sure after what we experienced with Professor Schmitt earlier.‚Äù  
I ripped my arm from her grasp and stepped a little further into the ascent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go check if it‚Äôs safe and come back for you if it eases your mind.‚Äù  
Mey looked at me, but her expression was darker than I expected. I didn‚Äôt realize it through my fear. I climbed up and looked around. My heart hammered as if it would consume my entire body. To my surprise, I could see the exit of the pyramid. I turned around to fetch Mey and froze. Mey was standing there, and behind her, the Wendigo was creeping closer.  
‚ÄúMEY, WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt get any further. The Wendigo grabbed her, and a smile flitted across her face. She smiled! Nothing made sense anymore. What was happening? Why was this creature doing nothing but wrapping its claw around Mey? The Wendigo rumbled, ‚ÄúI have devoured the others, as you commanded me, Master.‚Äù Mey stroked its snout and praised it. My heart nearly stopped. Did it just call Mey Master? Mey now looked me straight in the eyes. Her eyes flickered, yellow and cold like a snake‚Äôs, her pupils narrow and merciless.  
‚ÄúI am not what you think I am,‚Äù she said in a voice that sounded like an echo from another world.  
‚ÄúW-what‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù My voice was no longer more than a whisper.  
She laughed, and her gentle tone became demonically distorted. ‚ÄúI am the Keeper. The intermediary between this world and the chaos that Tezcatlipoca unleashes. Your souls are just a small price I must pay to disturb the balance.‚Äù  
‚ÄúTh-that‚Äôs not keeping! You let people be murdered!‚Äù  
She laughed, ‚ÄúOf course. How else am I supposed to collect enough souls?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat?! W-what for souls?‚Äù I backed away further at the question. ""Your dear friend Garden translated incorrectly and awakened something that feeds on the suffering of mortals."" ""NO... no, t-that can't be!"" She smiled, her eyes glowing. ""While you thought I was your friend, it was I who orchestrated all of this. Garden, Schmitt... they were all just tools for a higher purpose."" She ran her tongue over her lips. ""But then Garden also played into my hands by praising Tezcatlipoca, the god of chaos, instead of Tonatiuh, the sun god. In doing so, he gifted my pretty one here with freedom by sacrificing his oh-so-beloved student."" ""You won't let me go, will you?"" ""No, what are you thinking!? You will be the nourishment my Wendigo needs to hunt during the day as well. Then I can initiate the resurrection of Tezcatlipoca."" I turned my gaze toward the exit, where the first rays of sunlight appeared. Without realizing what was happening, I ran. I ran as fast as I could out of that hell. ""Get him!"" was the last thing I heard before the claws struck me and hurled me away. Fortunately, I was thrown against the entrance into the open air. The impact broke several of my ribs and my left arm, but I lay in the sunlight. The Wendigo reached for me, its claw stretching out as if to grasp my soul. But the sun‚Äîthe saving sun‚Äîtouched the tips of its claws, and flames flickered from its skin. A scream, deep and full of hatred, pierced the silence. I felt the heat on my face and ran, ran as if my life depended on that thin thread of light.

But as my legs carried me, I felt the emptiness inside me. I had escaped, but something in me had died. Mey, Schmitt, Garden‚Äîall were lost. Only I remained, a pitiful witness to a horror. Back in the shelter, I wrote down the lines you are now reading. It is already getting dark, and I can hear the growling of the Wendigo. He will come for me and...

Blood splattered and spread across the author‚Äôs desk. He gasped for air and could see the thing that was killing him for a moment. It hovered like a ghost, had long dagger-like fingers, pitch-black eyes, and a stitched-up mouth. The creature that had once worn Mey's skin now stood behind him, its hand plunged through his chest. He looked down at himself and could see his heart beating in the creature's hand. It leaned closer and whispered, as the threads unraveled to reveal three rows of sharp little teeth, ""Don‚Äôt worry, I will publish your last words and lure all the unbelievers so that they become food for Tezcatlipoca.""

1gc1hdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/1gc1hdv/a_vent_about_health_food/,"A Vent about ""health"" food","I feel so defeated. I hate HATE seeing all those posts and articles where Europeans turn up their noses at the ""fat, undisciplined, Americans"". 

I am trying to eat healthier but I feel like I'm failing. I and every other American never asked companies to dump tons of unnecessary sugar, sodium, fat and other artificial additives to our food! We don't want to be hurting ourselves with what we eat. But if you are poor then eating healthy is damn near impossible.

My diet has consistented as follows:

I've been eating Quakers fruit oatmeal for breakfast and coffee with oat vanilla creamer for breakfast. (My doctor told me me I need to watch my cholesterol so I am trying to eat something like oatmeal for the good cholesterol and the oat vanilla creamer as there isn't dairy in there so no saturated fat or cholesterol there)

I eat a morningstar veggie burger, a store brand fruit Greek yogurt, a banana, a PB and j sandwich, and frozen veggies for lunch. (My assumptions being: veggie burgers and frozen veggies are healthy. Greek yogurt has protein and good gut enzymes. Peanut butter has protein that will keep me full. And you can't go wrong with fresh fruit)

Supper has been tuna(or chicken or egg) salad sandwiches and tomato soup. (Tomato's are good for you and tuna and eggs are lean proteins.)

... And then I look at the sodium and sugar levels and I want to cry. It's never enough. There's so much salt and sugar in literally everything I buy. I am trying to shop on a budget and do what I can, but I feel like no matter how healthy I'm being, it won't matter. All the stuff I can afford that is labeled ""healthy"" is a lie. Everything that is actually healthy is like $7 a piece.

I keep trying to understand how to eat well but everyone says different things. Sugar is good! Sugar is bad! Protein is great! No it's actually bad! Carbs will help you lose weight! Carbs are the devil!

I feel like I'm not good enough. I'm really trying to do better with what's available to me, but I don't have time or energy for healthy home cooked meals.

I'm frustrated because I'm trying but it really doesn't matter since all ""healthy"" stuff that is affordable is a lie.",17,1729881748.0,PlusSize,22,0.76,False

i‚Äôm only asking because i work at a coffee shop and there‚Äôs this guy whose a regular , every time he comes he always try‚Äôs to strike a conversation with me and he‚Äôs really nice .

anyways he‚Äôs been coming here for about 3 months now . and i always go up to him and sit with him when im on break.

i just want to say that i did NOT KNOW he was rich. i just recently found out. my coworker told me that his parents own a big company and his dad passed it down to him and he makes MILLIONS per year .

that kinda made me sad ? i wasn‚Äôt even born in the US and he went to private elite schools while i was on food stamps and went to a bad high school with shady people in a shady part of town. my mom is a cashier and my dad is a driver . 

i think he‚Äôs going to ask me out but idk if i should give a try ? i don‚Äôt want to be a fling or just a girl for him to pass time with. if i date someone it‚Äôs with the intentions of marriage .

would a rich man ever marry a women who is not well off ? do you know any couple likes thin in real life . and i‚Äôm not just talking about marriage , im talking about long lasting love, devotion and commitment. or is that not realistic?

**Roast date**  
October 2nd, 2024

**Roaster**  
LaMill

**Roast level**  
""Medium espresso"" and ""Medium-dark"" are terms that are used on the website and bag respectively.

**Bean details**  
Blend of Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia.

**Dose**  
18 g ground coffee

**Yield**  
I've tried 18 g ristretto, 36 g normale, haven't tried 54 g lungo yet.

**Time**  
For my Flair Pro 2, shot times of 0:45-1:20 are good depending on the bean, this includes preinfusion. For this bean I've tried minimal preinfusion (just a few drops and then ramp up to 9 bar), and preinfusion up to 35 sec.

**Workflow**  
I use RDT with KINGrinder K6, not with Rancilio Rocky (I just fill the hopper).

WDT starting from the bottom and working my way up in a spiral.

Normcore 1.7 mm mesh puck screen that I keep clean with Cafiza and an ultrasonic bath plus rinse cycle. No soap residues in there, when the rinse is done it smells like clean metal.

**???**  
Is this a bean defect or a roast defect? I've been home roasting for about 15 years off and on, and I've never managed to produce anything like this. I know it isn't COVID-19 messing with my sense of taste/aroma because everything else (lemons, milk, bananas) tastes and smells like it always has. My wife smells the same thing, but had no idea what to call it and doesn't think it smells soapy, just ""kinda weird for coffee"".",1,1729881448.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1gc1cue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gc1cue,Which shinx to invest?,"Used production comparison from Raenonx and would appreciate anyone‚Äôs thoughts on the matter, thanks!

Don‚Äôt have a good tomato or oil Pok√©mon yet, and am looking to build teams for the new tomato curry and coffee salad. Got a really good shinx but has tomato and oil, more than fulfills tomato needs for making 3x tomato curry a day but only before level 60 - then at 60, fulfills roughly 2.5 tomato curries and enough oil for almost 3 coffee salads. Second shinx fulfills 2.5 tomato curries before 60, then more than enough for 3 a day after 60

I‚Äôm leaning the first shinx since it‚Äôs skills are great (and HB) and means investing into only one pokemon to fill two needs, and I get a lot of tomatoes now without having to wait until 60; I can stockpile a little tomatoes if I need to push on a given week anyway. But it‚Äôs not mono and would give me lots of ingredients I don‚Äôt need currently - maybe invest into first shinx for now, and keep using unless I happen to get both a significantly better mono oil + mono tomato mon?

First shinx has really good early subskills and nature, and farms ~85 tomatoes before 60 and ~63 of both tomatoes and oil at 60 (calculated with 1 helping bonus stack)

Second shinx is mono but subskills and nature are significantly worse, farms ~65 tomatoes before 60 and ~85 after that",3,1729881409.0,PokemonSleepBetter,2,1.0,False

*We found our AI who lost control was not the only one. Apparently, similar situations have happened throughout the world, almost at the same time. Some say those people were already infected with a pre-virus that forced them to act the way they did, connecting with others to spread the ill-code. On the Net, this is being called ""The Event"". If it really happened the way they say, this may be a plausible hypothesis. But what scares me the most is that none of these people have been found yet and it has already been some time since the event happened.*

¬†

Lunch was being served at the hospital when Koira arrived. She stopped by the cantina and saw Ryth with his parents; it was good seeing him happy with his family, and she couldn‚Äôt help but think of S√©ra. It would be good to have her around too, Koira was sure her niece would be happy in the Underground City.

She took a deep breath and kept going, thinking of S√©ra always hurt her, made her feel like a horrible person. She simply left the most important person in her life behind, and that was something she would never be able to forgive herself for.

After looking around for a while, Koira didn‚Äôt find Tovu, which wasn‚Äôt really a surprise, so she got herself some food and headed to his room. She stared at the wheeled bag where the prosthetics were, it would be good to have a distraction.

She asked herself if Tovu had any friends at the hospital, since she hadn‚Äôt seen him around with anyone. There was Ryth, but he was a kid, so maybe he wasn‚Äôt the company Tovu wanted. ‚ÄúAlso, I need to apologise for yesterday, I was out of my mind‚Äù, she thought.

She knocked on his door and, after a few seconds, he told her to come in. Koira sat on a chair by his bed and rested her plate on her legs.

‚Äî Oi, sorry ‚Äòbout last night. ‚Äî She was embarrassed.

‚Äî About the drinks? ‚Äî He let out a shy laugh. ‚Äî Don‚Äôt worry. ‚Äî Deep down, he felt happy she was thinking of him. ‚Äî So, is the energy problem solved once and for all?

‚Äî Eh, we hope, but we still have to make all the parts and install them, so it‚Äôll take a while.¬†

Tovu nodded, and kept eating. They ate in silence for sometime; Koira kept the prosthetics out of the room and she wanted to ask the man about going to the surface later to check them ‚Äî she thought it would make him more comfortable ‚Äî, but there were also other questions she needed some courage to ask. And gathering it took a while.

She kept staring at her plate in silence until it was unbearable: she needed to know.

‚Äî Tovu, when did ya leave Sand City?

‚Äî A few days after you. Why? ‚Äî He didn‚Äôt like talking about it. He felt ashamed of the blood on his hands.

‚Äî I wanted to ask about S√©ra. My niece.

‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know anything about her. But I know the Council was keeping surveillance, to know if she was dangerous or not.

‚Äî I see. Did ya get any news after ya left?

‚Äî No, we hardly keep contact during the, uhm, pilgrimage.

‚Äî Dammit. She never answered any of my letters. ‚Äî The sadness and anger were easy to hear in her voice.

‚Äî They probably destroy them as soon as they get to the city. That‚Äôs probably why.

‚Äî Why would they do that?! ‚Äî She looked at him, eyes filled with rage. Tovu was glad she hadn‚Äôt been violent since they met.

‚Äî To avoid dangerous news from getting into the city. ‚Äî He sighed. ‚Äî If people find out the Underground City does exist, many useful citizens would leave. That‚Äôs what they think, anyway.

‚Äî I wish I could go back and get her. If I could get a car, the trip would be easier.

‚Äî And they would kill you both. ‚Äî He had no pride in those words; Tovu had to admit the Sun Followers could be extreme towards those they didn‚Äôt like.

‚Äî That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt done it so far. I even asked the Mayor if she could help me, but she said if she did this for me, everyone would demand the resources to go after their loved ones, so she couldn‚Äôt.

‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry for you. I really am. I‚Ä¶ I wish I could change things. They probably count me as dead too, and since I know too much‚Ä¶ ‚Äî He shook his head, defeated. ‚Äî Or else I could try and get her for you.¬†

‚Äî Yah, that would be nice. Well, I‚Äôll keep sending letters anyway, at this point they know ya didn‚Äôt off me, right? So whatever.

‚Äî Yes, I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. Keep trying. Maybe send one with a different name and address, though I can‚Äôt promise they won‚Äôt open it.

‚Äî Such arseholes. ‚Äî she mumbled, and decided to change the subject before she was too angry to function: ‚Äî Anyway, wanna go upstairs? Sunbathe a bit?

‚Äî Yes. ‚Äî He smiled. ‚Äî I‚Äôd love that.

‚Äî Need help getting on the chair?

‚Äî No, but if you could bring it closer‚Ä¶ ‚Äî He couldn‚Äôt find it with his hand.

She got up and pushed the wheelchair near the bed. She watched as Tovu raised himself and sat, then she asked if he could propel it, and he replied by showing her. She then told him there was something she wanted to show him, but that would have to wait.

On the way, Koira tried to make conversation, keep her mind out of problems she couldn‚Äôt fix, though they kept piling up in her head. She asked if there was anything she could improve on the wheelchair, and Tovu laughed a bit. The only problem is that he couldn‚Äôt quite put the oil in the gears by himself, but the man was slowly building some strength in his right arm, which was good.

They went up the ramp and Tovu smiled as the sun caressed his skin. The Underground City was kept much colder than the desert, and that had taken some time for him to get used to; he loved the warmth of the Sun too much, it was a warm hug from an old friend, kisses of a long lost lover.

Koira helped him lay down on the floor, and sat by his side. Their relationship was strange; he had been her enemy for so long, a monster hidden in the shadows, and now they could sit side by side, close their eyes and relax. She found herself thinking if they could have always been friends in another life.

She heard Tovu whispering and looked at him; he was holding the Sun pendant on his neck and saying a prayer. When she paid attention, though, it wasn‚Äôt any of the ones she knew. There was nothing about punishment or judgement, his words were about love, forgiveness, and thanks. Koira smiled; he was changing.

She waited until he was finished to talk again:

‚Äî Before the blackout, ya said ya wanted to check the prosthetics.¬†

‚Äî Yes, I remember that. ‚Äî He turned his face to her, the bandana over his eyes and the simple loose clothes made him look like a blind ninja for a moment, like the ones from old comics Koira had read. She couldn‚Äôt help but smile a bit.

‚Äî So, I‚Äôve brought them here. In case you‚Äôre still interested.

‚Äî Oh. ‚Äî Tovu got quiet for a moment, thinking whether or not he was still interested. He was mostly afraid. ‚Äî Have you done this before? Prosthetics, I mean.

‚Äî Yah. I‚Äôve done a few hands and a leg. Last year, an engineer fell from the stairs and broke his leg in a way we couldn‚Äôt fix, and he ended up losing it. He‚Äôs back to work now, so if ya ever wanna talk to him about it, I can arrange it.

‚Äî I‚Äôd like that.¬†

‚Äî I‚Äôll talk to him, then! ‚Äî She tried to hide her enthusiasm. She failed. And for the first time, he didn‚Äôt seem to mind.

Tovu turned his head to the sky and dug the earth below with his fingers. He liked to ground himself in moments like these, they were the first step towards a change, and he wanted to remember that moment. Just in case he regretted it later.¬†

He wanted to remember how good feeling the ground was, how he felt surrounded by peace, by the warmth of the Sun, how it felt like the best opportunity he had ever had. An opportunity to become a better person and at least try to balance all the bad he had done and received.

And being able to walk again was nice too.

‚Äî Can I see them? With my hand, I mean? ‚Äî He laughed.

‚Äî Of course!

Koira got the prosthetics out of her bag and started describing them. They were mostly prototypes at the moment, and she would do some changes to best adapt them to Tovu‚Äôs body and needs. At the moment, they were made out of wood, since she thought that would be easier on him, but once he got used, she would build them with metal.

‚Äî It‚Äôs more resistant, and depending on the metal, ya can even get them wet.

Tovu felt the shape of the sanded wood on his fingers, smooth and free of splinters, he imagined it was glossy and varnished. Koira was talking about the surgery, he would need to put some supports on his arm and legs, to attach the wood limbs, and he could remove the limbs any time he wanted to.

He felt the wooden fingers, the articulations, and imagined how he would look with them. Koira was still blabbering about springs and joints, how the rotators worked, and that he would have to learn how to walk again, once the nerves and tendons were connected, but he wasn‚Äôt really paying attention.

He touched a wooden knee and bent the leg, it was lighter than he expected, and maybe it wasn‚Äôt so bad. Tovu understood the recuperation period would be long, and he would probably have to test multiple models until one was a perfect fit ‚Äî kind of like shoes ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt sound so bad now.

‚Äî Do they have motors or something?

‚Äî Not really, you‚Äôll be the one powering them. The springs and moving mechanisms will do the rest.

‚Äî Do you think they will actually help me?¬†

‚Äî I think so. I know that if I was in a similar situation, I‚Äôd like to have them as an option.

‚Äî They don‚Äôt feel‚Ä¶ evil. ‚Äî He felt stupid saying that, but he needed to say it.

‚Äî They‚Äôre not. I can even make them look as natural as possible, we have some high-quality silicone that looks a lot like skin.

‚Äî I think I‚Äôd prefer it if they didn‚Äôt look like skin. Not that it would make any difference for me, I think, but‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt explain it, I think I‚Äôd feel safer knowing the limbs are not trying to fool me or anyone.

‚Äî Okay? ‚Äî Koira chuckled. ‚Äî In the end, it‚Äôs all up to ya. And I won‚Äôt be angry if ya decide not to use them.

‚Äî Thank you. ‚Äî The sincerity in his voice surprised her. It surprised her every time. ‚Äî I‚Äôll talk to the engineer and think about it.

‚Äî No rush.

The sun was almost setting, so Koira asked if he wanted to go back, to what he nodded. She put the wooden limbs back into the bag and helped Tovu sit on his wheelchair. That was a good afternoon, and when she got back home, her mind was a little lighter than before.



***Log. 6384.h***  
*Something strange happened. Our AIs were stable, we were testing the antidote-code, then one of them got out of control. We couldn‚Äôt understand it quite well, it happened too fast, but it seemed like it was trying to physically share the virus somehow. We had to kill them.*

¬†

No one could tell for how long they had been sitting in the explosives room. It could have been days for all they knew. Nika was sitting on the floor, hugging her knees, her eyes focused on the nothingness ahead. Resha was sitting beside her, an arm around her shoulders, trying to console the woman; however they were also hurt.

‚Äî It killed Finn. ‚Äî Nika whispered. ‚Äî And I couldn‚Äôt do anything.

‚Äî It‚Äôs not your fault, Nik, that machine, Immortal, whatever it is, it‚Äôs a monster.

‚Äî And we‚Äôre *all* gonna die if we don‚Äôt figure out a way to destroy it. ‚Äî Misha concluded. She was also hurt by Finnian‚Äôs death, but there was nothing they could do about him now. ‚Äî We need to survive, so that his sacrifice isn‚Äôt in vain.

‚Äî Oh, fuck off, Misha! ‚Äî Nika jumped up and prepared a punch. ‚Äî You think you‚Äôre so high and mighty, but all you care about is your brother!

‚Äî He‚Äôs my family, Nika. The only family I have! Because when a machine like that killed our parents, he was all I had left! So, yeah, I care about him more than most, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt care about Finnian or Little Finny! ‚Äî Her hands were balled tight, her knuckles almost white. The Farmers had always been raised to be kind people, but it was difficult being gentle in situations like that.

‚Äî Okay, everybody quiet. That *thing* is still out there, and we‚Äôre in here, so we need to find a way out. ‚Äî Resha got between them. ‚Äî But Misha is right, we need to destroy it. If we can get out, that monster can as well.

‚Äî Oi, I might have a solution. ‚Äî S√©ra‚Äôs voice had almost no sound. She was shaking from head to toe from the whole situation, and the fight was making it worse by bringing memories up to the surface when she was trying so hard to drown them again.

She pointed to the boxes on the floor, and said those were probably explosives. The cables connected it to something on the skeleton at the other wall, and she asked Ganen to take a look. S√©ra didn‚Äôt want to deal with more bodies, and Ganen needed the distraction ‚Äî if one could call it that.

‚Äî There‚Äôs a squishy handle on their hand. Excuse me. ‚Äî she mumbled while getting it off. ‚Äî Seemed like it had cables connected to the end here‚Ä¶ ‚Äî And when she pressed it, sparks escaped from it and she got a shock. ‚Äî Ouch!

The handle fell on the floor and Ganen hesitated to get it back. After a few seconds, she got it and handed it to S√©ra. The part where the cables had been connected to was destroyed by time ‚Äî no one knew for how long those things had been sitting there ‚Äî, but maybe they could get another one.

‚Äî We need to find one that‚Äôs working, I can connect the cables, we get the Immortal here, and‚Ä¶ boom. ‚Äî S√©ra hoped that would be enough. She hoped she was right. The closest thing to a bomb she had ever worked on was a defective battery, and worst case scenario, it would catch fire, not explode. ‚Äî There‚Äôs a bunch of boxes, help me look for it.

Misha translated the plan for Gayo while Resha kept comforting Nika, and soon everybody was focused on the task; it was better than sitting down, thinking about death. S√©ra took a deep breath and started working on some cables, all she had were a screwdriver and a wrench in her pockets, and that would have to work.¬†

They could hear the Immortal scratching the door, trying to turn the handle, and after some time, they started hearing dragging sounds. The machine was ripping the other bodies apart, separating the tissues, nerves, and tendons. Resha slowly opened the door in silence, only to see it organising organs on a table.¬†

However, as soon as the Immortal noticed them, it turned its lights off and disappeared. Resha closed the door in the same instant, and after a few clicks, and then there was nothing but silence. They tried to look for it in the darkness, through the small window on the door, but there was nothing to be seen.

‚Äî It killed Finnian. ‚Äî Nika started again, this time, talking to the scrawny man. ‚Äî But it didn‚Äôt kill you or me. It also went after Gayo and, uhm, Ganen, but not after the others. Why?

‚Äî I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ know. It likes‚Ä¶ different people. Lorn was‚Ä¶ kissed by the Moon‚Ä¶ just like you. But only some parts‚Ä¶ not the‚Ä¶ whole body. ‚Äî Speaking was more difficult, blood kept pooling under the man.

‚Äî So that means one of us could distract it, or get it here for the bombs.

‚Äî I think it‚Äôll come on its own if we open the door and make some noise. ‚Äî Misha didn‚Äôt like using someone as bait. She kept looking for a squishy handle, but her wall of boxes was full of cables and random containers.

‚Äî Not really. ‚Äî Resha said while opening some boxes. ‚Äî I tried to look for it, come up with a strategy, but it seems to be hiding.

‚Äî I hate this. ‚Äî Misha complained.

Resha opened a metal box and there was a shiny handle; they smiled. On top of the box, there was a word, *clackers*, written in poor caligraphy on a piece of paper, but they would never suspect something with such a harmless and funny name could activate explosives. They gave one to S√©ra and asked how it would work.

‚Äî The cables are connected to the boxes, eh? And when Ganen pressed this, uhm, clacker thingy, it made a spark, right? So I assume the boxes need some electrical current to explode, and this ‚Äî She raised the clacker. ‚Äî will give them the zap.

‚Äî The what?

‚Äî The electricity, sorry, I‚Äôm nervous, but tinkering with stuff like this is what I do best, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work. ‚Äî S√©ra was also trying to convince herself.

S√©ra explained the workings of the explosives and gave each of them a task; it would keep them busy, make them useful, and keep people from arguing with one another. One thing S√©ra had learnt in Sand City was that busy hands kept the mind occupied.

Nika, however, had other plans, a *plan B*, just in case. And while she connected the cables to the clacker, she also separated some for herself. A reassurance that the machine, that Immortal, wouldn‚Äôt get to keep its title. It killed Finnian, the pups, and so many others, though she had no love for the Forest People who tried to hurt them. Nevertheless, the beast shouldn‚Äôt leave that bunker.

‚Äî Okay, I think it‚Äôs done. Turn off the lanterns so we don‚Äôt get it here too soon. ‚Äî S√©ra had the clacker in hand. ‚Äî Stay behind me, guys. ‚Äî She checked if all the ‚Äúfront toward enemy‚Äù were facing the door, and took a deep breath to prepare herself.

‚Äî I‚Äôll open the door. ‚Äî Nika already had a hand on the handle, and didn‚Äôt let anyone stop her. ‚Äî I‚Äôll get it here, right? In front of the door?

S√©ra was about to answer when Misha interrupted her:

‚Äî No, Nika, wait!

But the woman opened the door anyway. To their surprise, there was no reaction from the Immortal. Misha ran to her side, held her hand, and looked into the bunker: there was nothing.

‚Äî Do you think it‚Äôs left? ‚Äî Misha asked.

‚Äî I don‚Äôt think so. ‚Äî Nika replied, as she adjusted her coat. ‚Äî But if it has, we need to go after it.

‚Äî I don‚Äôt think we should move the explosives around, though. We ain‚Äôt sure how it really works, maybe moving it can be dangerous.

Gayo hit his foot on the floor a few times to get their attention, then signalled: ‚ÄúI think we should all go. Stay close. One of us will see the Immortal, then we run back here and boom.‚Äù

‚Äî I still don‚Äôt like it. ‚Äî his sister complained.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other choice, is there?‚Äù he insisted.

‚Äî Fine. But everybody, stay *close*. No roaming around. We can explore once it‚Äôs dead.

In a line, the group left the explosives room and started moving one step at a time, as silent as they could be. Ganen held S√©ra‚Äôs hand and could feel her lover shaking a bit. They were both scared, the smell of blood poisoned their lungs, and the silence‚Ä¶ the silence was deafening.

But the darkness was almost a blessing. Finnian was spread all over the floor, there were dead bodies hiding in the shadows, it was best if they couldn‚Äôt see it. Every time S√©ra stepped on something a little softer than the floor, she tried to think it was just a wet rag, but deep down she knew what it could be.

As much as humans considered themselves the hunters, this time they were prey. Their predator was somewhere out of sight, it dressed itself in shadows and was omnipresent. It could be right in front of them, a step backward each time they moved forward. There was no way to know.

Nika said Gayo, Ganen and herself shouldn‚Äôt be at the edges of the line, since the Immortal was targeting them, so they were in the middle, with S√©ra, while Resha was the last and Misha was the first. Their steps had no destination, no aim, besides keeping all of them alive, and the distance between them increased in the dark.

Until something whispered in Nika‚Äôs ear. The wind, the air, perhaps a bug, she had sharpened her senses for years, and they had never let her down. When she stopped and turned around, a shadow moved centimetres above Gayo.

Resha was too far, and there was no time to run away, Nika‚Äôs instincts acted first and she pushed Gayo out of the way. On the floor, the man was about to complain when cyan lights blinded him and the Immortal fell over Nika. She looked at him one last time, her eyes filled with rage and vengeance, and pressed something in her pocket.

Koira hadn‚Äôt heard from Qena for a few days. She tried calling her by the comms, but the woman wouldn‚Äôt answer. She decided to give her some time, while she arranged the talk with the engineer who had lost a leg. Tovu was anxious about it, but as he said, not in a way that made his stomach hurt.

The engineer, Luqa, worked for Ana at the University, and Koira found herself excited with the chance of talking to the woman again. They had shared some ideas through the communication devices, but their schedules struggled to get to an agreement.

So when she entered the building that day, Koira was surprised to see Ana at the front desk, talking to one of the receptionists. She was wearing her white lab coat, and her dark hair was a mess, like if she hadn‚Äôt combed it in days; Koira let out a shy laugh, she couldn‚Äôt really judge.

Once Ana finished talking to the receptionist, she turned around and saw Koira in the hall, looking at some pictures on the wall. With a smile, she walked to the woman and asked if she wanted to go outside.

‚Äî I really need a smoke. ‚Äî Ana explained. Once outside, she lit her cigarette and let out a cloud of smoke before doing anything else. ‚Äî So, what brings you around?

‚Äî I wanted to ask ya if that engineer who lost a leg, Luqa, is still working here. ‚Äî She accepted the cigarette Ana offered.

‚Äî He does, not today, though. Day off. Why?

‚Äî Tovu is almost accepting the prosthetics, and he said he would like to talk to someone who‚Äôs been through it. ‚Äî Her smile let everyone know how excited she was. ‚Äî Do ya think Luqa would talk to him?

‚Äî I think so, I‚Äôll comm him. By the way, since you‚Äôre here, wanna check how the chainmail loom is doing?

‚Äî Please! I thought ya‚Äôd never ask!

The machine looked indeed like a loom for knitting, which made Koira laugh. The design was quite simple, and hooks did it all by themselves. Ana said they were making two more, to speed up the process, and soon they could start applying them to the cables.

Since Tovu was getting quite good at the wheelchair, Luqa invited them for some tea. Koira walked beside the man, making sure he wouldn't bump into anything. The streets weren't *that* good for wheelchairs.

She asked the first few questions, then watched as Tovu started asking by himself. It was good to see his improvement and how he was changing the way he used to think.¬†

Luqa told him how having a prosthetic helped him. He even showed two of his that were personalised for running or driving. And once he was fully healed, Luqa was able to go back to work.

That was something Tovu hadn't thought of until that moment. The *need* for being useful was ingrained in the minds of Sand people, and maybe that was the reason he had been so nervous. He was laying in bed all day, doing nothing. That might have just been the push he needed.

Luqa had promised he would help Tovu in his rehabilitation ‚Äî if he decided to go through the surgery ‚Äî so that he would already know someone in the clinic.¬†

The curious thing was that Tovu didn't ask any of the usual questions, *Does it hurt? Is the surgery bad? How long did it take you to walk again?* He asked how the metal felt on the skin. If it ever bled. If he started having strange thoughts or dreams, things he wouldn't have imagined before the surgery.

Luqa let out a nervous laugh, he had no idea what Tovu was talking about. The words he used made the man a bit uncomfortable, like if the prosthetics could infect him somehow. It was weird thinking about that, thinking that the metal against his skin could one day make him a different person.

‚Äî Well, the only thing I thought was that I would be able to walk and run again, though the running part is still a process. ‚Äî Luqa tried to smile.¬†

‚Äî I see. Thank you, Luqa. ‚Äî Tovu answered. ‚Äî This is all too new and strange for me. I suppose getting used to the idea is also a process.

‚Äî You won‚Äôt regret it, you know? And if you ever do, just take them off. ‚Äî He shrugged.

‚Äî Wait. It‚Äôs not permanent? ‚Äî Tovu turned his head to where he thought Koira was.

‚Äî No. I mean, ya can take them off to shower, sleep and such. There is a small part that will be permanently attached to ya, to connect the nerves, tendons and the like, but the limbs themselves are, uhm, removable. And if you ever want, we could remove the nerve connector as well. Although that would require a small surgery.¬†

Tovu kept silent for a moment. That didn‚Äôt sound half-bad. He imagined being able to use his left hand again, and the thought made him smile. Learning how to use the right one had been quite a challenge. It was true he couldn‚Äôt see Luqa‚Äôs leg, and asking to touch it would be awkward, so he had to trust them, but that hadn‚Äôt been as difficult as before. Maybe he could go through with it. Just maybe.

It returns to its previous setting and resumes the function of erasing memories, but this is getting less effective by the day. If I still ate, I‚Äôd be drinking enormous amounts of coffee.*



The explosion was too loud, the *boom* echoed within the bunker. Scorching metal pieces were scattered throughout the place, their ears were ringing and no one really knew where to look.

Gayo was rubbing his eyes, his whole body hurt, and the little he ate, before leaving his house, was about to be evicted.

‚Äî Ganen‚Ä¶ ‚Äî S√©ra blinked a few times, all she could see were little stars among the darkness. ‚Äî Where‚Ä¶?¬†

She tried to find her lover, while Ganen was starting to get up, unaware of where she was. She looked at her hands, where some cuts and scratches were bleeding, and she couldn‚Äôt put the pieces of her memory together.¬†

Resha was the first to snap out of it and stumbled towards what was left of the Immortal. They started digging through the metal, Nika was there just a moment ago, and once they found what was left of the woman, Resha turned around and vomited.¬†

Misha was a few metres ahead, on the floor, trying to sit. Her eyes couldn‚Äôt focus on anything, like there was nothing to see, and it felt like something was about to burst out of her skull. She heard Resha scream, but it sounded kilometres away.

Gayo shook his head and got up. He hadn‚Äôt heard the blast, but he felt the pressure, the force of the explosion. He blinked a few more times, and hugged his sore body. Slow steps took him closer to the scorching metal mess, and he held Resha‚Äôs hands. They were burnt and hurt, and yet Nika was nowhere to be seen.

‚Äî She‚Äôs gone. ‚Äî Resha said and signalled.

‚Äî What? ‚Äî Misha was too far, the words didn‚Äôt make sense. She had no idea what had happened.

‚Äî She‚Äôs gone! ‚Äî They screamed. ‚Äî Either the machine fell too heavy on her or‚Ä¶¬†

‚Äî Or she exploded‚Ä¶ ‚Äî S√©ra was finally on her feet. ‚Äî Ah‚Ä¶ the explosives‚Ä¶ maybe she had one.

‚Äî When did she get one?? ‚Äî Resha found all that revolting. ‚Äî How did we not see Nika getting *and hiding* explosives with her?

They looked at one another, confused, heartbroken, not yet accepting that fate. Misha got closer, touched the warm metal, and pushed a claw away. Nika‚Äôs white hair was stained in dark red blood among the mess.

‚Äî We need to leave. ‚Äî she mumbled.

I just want to ask for some tips/advice on setting boundaries with an extremely self-centered friend. To be honest, this person and I weren't too close and we were acquaintances, but he asked me to catch up over coffee one day, we stopped by some stores for fun the same day, and now, he mainly texts me to vent to me about his partner, how busy he is and how tired and in need of support he is, and to ask me if I want to go eat somewhere, only to totally flake after 10 minutes and reaffirm that he's super busy. I have told him about things that happened in my life that were difficult, like this time I was dealing with a very toxic acquaintance who made me feel anxious a lot of the time, and he always without fail manages to turn the conversation to himself (oh but I'm so anxious now it's killing me). It seems he wants me to comfort him and give him lots of affirmation, and I have done this before, but he doesn't seem to know when to stop and help himself. I really don't want to anymore and I feel the need to set boundaries. I also suggested to him to see a local therapist, but he brushed that suggestion off. I have had experience with lots of this kind of people and when you try to set those boundaries, they never react well. To be honest, I think he wants to be my friend more than the other way around, mainly because he needs an outlet for venting. 

He texted me recently, saying that he wants to go eat somewhere, and then he said but he has homework, and then in a next text tells me he's not feeling well and needs to reschedule, and then proceeds to whine and say that he is going out of control. All of this within the span of 24 hours. I haven't replied yet, but I don't know if the correct choice is to just not reply/leave on read, or say something like ""It's okay, take care of yourself first - please don't suggest to me to go somewhere and then immediately flake and tell me you're busy. I know you're not feeling well, and I hope you feel better, but this kind of behavior is not respectful to my time and energy."" What do you think? Anything helps - thank you!

It‚Äôs constant and exhausting. 

Although I‚Äôm comfortable with being somewhat reclusive and very introverted, I feel slightly embarrassed when I‚Äôm often saying I have nothing planned.
My colleagues are all very chatty and always have lots going on over the weekend, and I hate feeling like they‚Äôre judging me when I say ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm not up to much this weekend‚Äô, a few weeks in a row.

I absolutely love having no plans and being able to get up on my own time and have a lazy morning, potter around doing housework, listen to music, reading and snuggling up to watch a series or movie with some nice snacks. It really makes me happy, and although I do go out from time to time and see a couple of close friends, the lady I sit next to at work has strong opinions that people my age (mid 20s) should have a busy social life and lots of plans, and if not then they must have no life or be unhappy. 

Sometimes I find myself telling a white lie saying ‚Äòoh I might see a friend for coffee‚Äô or something similar, just to feel less judged. But I hate doing that and I wish I didn‚Äôt feel like I have to have something fun planned to be viewed as ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô in their eyes. 
Maybe I‚Äôm too self conscious, and I‚Äôm trying to work on that and not care so much what others think of me, but the social pressure at work sometimes gets the better of me.

This is my first post on reddit and I'm asking for some help. I was passing through the Moynihan Train Hall yesterday with my husband and we briefly visited Vesuvio Bakery before getting on the train and leaving the state (we don't live in NY).

While we were looking around Vesuvio, the bags of coffee they are selling (not their coffee but another company brand name) caught his eye. He loves coffee and loves to buy beans from different roasters. On the way home, he mentioned how he regretted not buying a bag and we couldn't remember the name of the company that makes the coffee beans they are selling right now. That's where I need help...

I tried to call the bakery, but they were not very helpful and quickly became irritated with me. Also, the phone number listed for that location isn't the location in the train station, they said that location doesn't have a phone and that I'd have to visit in person. They also didn't quite understand that I wasn't asking about their coffee beans, I was asking about the bags of beans from another company that they are currently selling.

If someone is in the area, would you be able to visit Vesuvio and get the name of the coffee company they are selling bags of beans of right now? If you're facing the bakery, it is on the left hand side on a few shelves where they would sell hats or other merchandise.

Thank you all so much for your help. I'd love nothing more than to be able to order my husband a bag of this coffee so that he can try it.",1,1729879957.0,nycquestions,0,1.0,False
