1pix6xi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pix6xi,"Okay Caffeine Baar, I See Why People Hype Your Fermentations","Tried Caffeine Baar’s sample packs and damn, this brand actually knows what it’s doing.
Their coffees are flavourful, sweet, and the notes aren’t some imaginary marketing text, you can actually taste them. Pineapple fermentation, mixed fruit fermentation, frozen cherry, intenso… all stood out clearly for me.

Here are my quick takes on each one:

• Whisky Barrel Aged
Raw, oaky, and gives off that single-malt vibe in both aroma and taste. Kinda wild in a good way. Solid pick, would definitely recommend.

• Honey Sun Dried
Mid. Didn’t get the cherry or orange notes they claimed. Drinkable but not something I’d buy again.

• Pineapple Fermentation
Insane. Proper pineapple aftertaste, sweet, bright, and the aroma is really good,legit after you sip it feels like the coffee is doing brushstrokes on your tongue xD 
I instantly bought the bigger pack after the sample, would definitely recommend.

• Mixed Fruit Fermentation
Super fruity and sweet once it opens up. Took around 2 weeks to truly bloom, but when it did… chef’s kiss. Easily one of the best, it's just like a sweet bomb. I would highly recommend it you like sweet coffee.

• Frozen Cherry
Balanced. Some brews were great, some were just okay ,Might be because I was still learning my V60 flow then, so maybe I did it dirty. Still good enough to recommend.

• Intenso Fermentation
Not too sweet, a bit woody, and really satisfying. If you like something slightly bitter but rich, and very addictive. My second favourite after Mixed Fruit.

Overall, Caffeine Baar is absolutely worth trying. If you want to start somewhere, go Pineapple and Mixed Fruit — those two are the clear winners for me.
And if you’ve got a specific V60 or French press method that worked well for you, do drop it in the comments :)

I just literally saw him once before on gym way back 2021 when I had my vacation on my parents city and I was like dang this guy is fine and I even told myself I want him to be my bf haha after that I didn't see him again and I went back to my city. Fast forward this year early 2025 I helped my parents to move in a new village and I saw him! I was like shocked because it turns out he's our neighbor. I was like walking one time and I saw him with his friends. I feel like he looks at me and I messaged my friends haha like I'm delusional. Then later that night I was so freaking nervous and shocked because he approached me and asked my name the rest was history. However we didn't end up because his emotional traits didn't match with mine then we didn't see each other again even though we're just neighbors. Then I went back to my city since vacation is over and I manifested him for many months where his emotional characteristic matches mine but I feel like nothing happened. I am on the verge of giving up so then yesterday I went to the city again to get my parents'presents for me and I told myself if I didn't see him because it's been months I will stop already then I stopped by at the coffee shop and damn I saw him there with his big bike! He looks at me and I stare at him back. He was about to leave the coffee shop then he went back again but that's it lol he didn't even say hi to me. ,1,1765354233.0,manifestingSP,0,1.0,False

ETH — Quantitative Market Structure Report
⸻
1. Volatility Structure

The volatility dynamics of ETH present a regime where:

\text{IV}_{7–30d} \approx 0.34{-}0.36,\qquad
\text{RV}_{30d} \approx 0.41{-}0.42

or a gap:

\Delta_{\text{IV-RV}} = \text{IV} - \text{RV} \approx -0.06{-}0.08.

This regime where IV < RV classically corresponds to:

\mathbb{E}[\text{payoff}_{\text{short-gamma}}] > 0

under the assumption of moderate diffusion — in other words, the market “offers” the premium without extreme probabilities overload.
Traders like to call it “a statistical gentleman’s agreement,” because everyone pretends to be reasonable.

The implicit convexity of the skew is in contraction:

\frac{\partial^2 \sigma_{\text{impl}}}{\partial K^2} \downarrow

→ reduction in the cost of hedging wings, normalization of the price of extreme risk.
⸻
2. On-Chain State Variables

From a quantitative point of view, blob fees play the role of a congestion indicator analogous to a channel overload metric:

f_{\text{blob}} \approx 1.5{-}2.0 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{ETH}

The temporal variance of blob fees:

\operatorname{Var}(f_{\text{blob}}) \downarrow

→ stabilization of the DA pipeline, compatibility with the EIP-4844 target throughput.

The “cost / effective capacity of rollups” ratio returns to a zone where:

\frac{C_{\text{DA}}}{T_{\text{rollup}}} \to \text{acceptable constant}

which means rollups stop behaving like upset teenagers.

The L1→L2 update intervals also show a narrower distribution:

\operatorname{StdDev}(\Delta t_{\text{settlement}}) \downarrow

— and every quant knows that a system suddenly becomes “beautiful” as soon as the standard deviation starts to fall.
⸻
3. Flow & Cross-Asset Dynamics

Institutional entries:

F_{\text{FTE}}^{7d} \approx +40{-}60\ \text{M USD}

are consistent with a measured recovery in risk.

The Nasdaq correlation is stable in the corridor:

\rho(\text{ETH}, \text{NDX}) \approx 0.68{-}0.74,

which positions ETH as a moderate beta-tech asset, with its own structural component (staking + DA + rollups).

Perp funding is neutral:

r_{\text{funding}} \approx 0

→ absence of forced imbalance on the positioning side, rare and generally synonymous with an exploitable window for “weakly convex” directional strategies.
⸻
4. Tactical Allocation Models

The current quant framework favors strategies where the P&L depends on:

\text{PnL} = \theta - \frac{1}{2}\Gamma (\Delta S)^2 - \nu \Delta \sigma + r_{\text{funding}} S \Delta t.

In this specific diet:
• \Gamma > 0 costs less to short (high flight achieved but lower implied).
• \nu (vega sensitivity) is moderate thanks to skew flattening.
• \theta > 0 becomes the main component of the PnL (implicit carry).

The optimal posture observed on desks as to:
	1. Reduced core spot
w_{\text{spot}} \approx 0.10{-}0.25
	2. Disciplined short gamma (controlled strangles, non-aggressive wings)
	3. Perpetual roll to capture:
\text{carry}_{\text{perp}} \approx r_{\text{funding}} \to 0^{+}

The objective is not the narrative factor, but the stability of the diffusion process.
⸻
5. Structural Interpretation

ETH no longer acts as a hyperactive “jump-diffusion” asset but rather as a controlled volatility process, with:

dS = \mu S\, dt + \sigma(t) S\, dW_t ,

where \sigma(t) tends towards a stable low-medium regime rather than pulsating chaos.

And, to extend the British metaphor:
a stochastic model that holds up well is much more predictable than a market maker tired after three coffees.

​Earth Time: May 14, 2348

​Gitor System, Plague Empire territory

​Distance from Earth: 342 light years

​The darkness of space outside the Sandstorm's viewports was thick with movement. Thousands of navigation lights—from powerful bulk carriers barely squeezing through the 50-meter diameter gates to nimble courier frigates—formed a river of metal, slowly flowing toward a silvery point in the distance: the 'Needle' Gate. A galactic bottleneck through which the life, goods, and greed of the entire sector spilled.

​Inside the Sandstorm, a modified Viper-class transport, however, there was an order that would have been impossible just a year ago.

​Kael Thorne entered the mess, holding two steaming mugs. These weren't the sealed containers with tubes they had to use during decades of service in the Guard and on their old ship. These were real, ceramic mugs, in which liquid behaved as it should—steaming upwards and staying at the bottom.

​He placed the coffee in front of Lena Kowalska, who was sitting with her feet propped up on the navigation console, reviewing cargo manifests.

​""I didn't want to install it; I begrudged the Imperial credits,"" Kael grumbled, sitting heavily in a chair that sank under his weight instead of pushing him up. ""But damn, now that you can drink coffee from a normal mug and not worry about a drop flying into your eye or shorting out a control panel... it changes everything. A mop and a brush stood in the corner of the mess, and a bucket was filled with water. Kael looked in that direction with a smile on his face.""

​Lena laughed scornfully, not taking her eyes off the screen. Despite the years, her face still looked young thanks to the nanites, but a veteran's cynical amusement lurked in her eyes.

​""I told you it would improve our quality of life. Especially during these damn long transfer queues,"" she replied, taking a sip. ""Expensive, yes, but the Empire's gravity generator is a game-changer, Earth gravity throughout the crew compartment. Sweet. You can even piss like a human, not an astronaut.""

​Kael nodded, savoring the taste of real Arabica, another luxury they could afford.

​""How's the queue for the Needle? Much longer?"" he asked, glancing at the external tactical display.

​""About three hundred and fifty ships ahead of us,"" Lena sighed. ""So, about seven to eight hours of boredom, if the Swarm maintains the transfer speed.""

​In the Sandstorm's cargo hold, beneath a layer of legal mining machinery parts, rested ten tons of Filopi. It was an unassuming, purple plant that grew only on the planet Gitor. To humans, it was a useless weed, but to the L'thaarr race, overworked in Imperial shipyards and offices, its hallucinogenic properties were the only solace. They would pay any price for it.

​""Hope this transponder turns out to be right and they don't do a random search,"" Kael muttered, feeling that specific squeeze in his stomach that accompanied every smuggler. ""If they discover the Filopi, we'll end up in an Imperial prison for years. Filopi was legal in the Empire, but not paying taxes on the future transaction was not.""

​Lena smiled faintly, turning an Imperial code card between her fingers.

​""Relax. Ta'hirim has never failed us. She gave us the highest-level trade codes. Besides..."" Lena looked at him meaningfully. ""She has a soft spot for you. You sly dog.""

​Kael choked on his coffee.

​""I was drunk, Lena!"" he snapped, feeling his cheeks burn. ""And I mean really drunk. That was after we celebrated our success on Vega Station.""

​""I know, I know,"" Lena waved her hand, enjoying the situation. ""But to hook up with a female of the Plague race? And do it so well that now, whenever she sees you on a video link, she bares those sharp teeth like a teenager?""

​""First of all, Lena,"" Kael pointed a finger at her, trying to maintain seriousness, ""she used me. She wanted to know what it was like with us. And without my Hoplite armor, I didn't have a chance to resist.""

​Lena snorted with laughter, nearly spilling her coffee. ""You always liked the predatory ones, after all.""

​""Technical details aside, you rogue, but you must have enjoyed her foreplay, otherwise your dick wouldn't have stood up.""

​Kael groaned, burying his face in his hands while Lena laughed scornfully. However, her laughter was brutally interrupted.

​A red light flooded the bridge. The wail of an alarm pierced the air. Both instantly ran to the bridge.

​""Damn it!"" Lena instantly switched to combat mode. Her fingers flew across the console. ""Control! They're actively scanning us! Penetrating beam!""

​""The transponder was junk?"" Kael yelled, scrambling toward the defensive systems. ""Did Ta'hirim betray us or get caught?""

​""I don't know.""

​On the main screen, transmitting the external camera view, a shadow appeared. It was fast, predatory, and dangerous. A ship burst out of deep space, braking hard right next to the line of civilian vessels. It wasn't a typical frigate or destroyer.

​""That's an Imperial 'Talon' class pocket battleship,"" Lena recognized the design instantly. Her voice hardened. ""The latest generation. Full automation, crew reduced to a minimum, nothing but combat systems. That's not a customs officer, Kael. That's an enforcer.""

​The Plague ship hung in the void like a bird of prey. Its energy cannons glowed blue, ready to fire. The scanner beam swept over the ships in the queue, mercilessly stripping them of their secrets.

​""Oh, crap..."" Kael whispered. ""They're looking for someone. Scanning everyone. If they find the Filopi...""

​""We can't run,"" Lena assessed coolly. ""In this queue, before we spool up the Higgs engines, they'll turn us into a cloud of plasma. We sit and we pray.""

​The scanner beam hit the Sandstorm. The ship shuddered, systems howled a warning. They waited for the verdict. For the shot that would tear the hull apart, or the order to board.

​Instead, a voice came through the speakers. It was the harsh, synthesized language of the Empire, hard and commanding.

​""Unit Sandstorm. We know you are using a counterfeit transponder. Your signature has been identified. Lena Kowalska and Kael Thorne. Do not attempt to escape.""

​Kael looked at Lena, his hand instinctively reaching for the pistol hidden under the console.

​""This is it,"" he muttered.

​However, the voice continued, and the tone of the command changed into something nobody expected.

​""Lena Kowalska. Prepare to approach the Trade Gate. You are bypassing the queue. You have priority transit status.""

​Lena blinked, looking at Kael.

​""What the hell?"" Kael asked, taking his hand off the weapon. ""No arrest? No boarding?""

​""Wait..."" Lena stared at the sensor readings.

​Something incredible was happening around them. The Imperial 'Talon' battleship fired a series of signal flares. Hundreds of patiently waiting ships began frantically firing their plasma maneuvering thrusters, moving aside. In the dense crowd of ships, a perfectly empty corridor opened up, leading straight to the silvery disk of the gate.

​""They gave us a corridor..."" Lena whispered in disbelief. ""All the waiting transports are making way for us. Like we're some kind of damn dignitaries.""

​""Holy hell, what is going on?"" Kael watched as powerful, kilometer-long bulk carriers moved out of the way for their small smuggler ship.

​""Sandstorm. Proceed to the gate. A direct tunnel to Ruha'sm will open shortly. Only your unit has the right of passage.""

​""Ruha'sm?"" Lena looked at Kael. ""The Empire's capital? Direct? We don't have a direct connection from here! We'd have to jump through three nodes!""

​The 'Needle' Gate in front of them began to pulse. The standard blue light of the event horizon, which led to the trade node, suddenly went out. The gate became black, dead. Hundreds of ships in the queue froze.

​And then, inside the fifty-meter diameter ring, a new light ignited. Not blue. Purple. Intense, royal, terrifying.

​The energy needed to reconfigure the tunnel over such a gigantic distance, outside of the standard schedule, was astronomical. It was a waste of resources, of antimatter, that only someone with absolute authority could afford.

​""They're shutting down standard traffic for the whole sector... just for us,"" Kael said, feeling a chill down his spine. ""Someone very, very much wants to see us in the capital. And immediately.""

​Lena gripped the controls. Her face was a mask of focus.

​""Doesn't matter who. If they give you a highway, you take it. Kael, strap in. This is going to be a rough jump. This is not a standard tunnel.""

​The Sandstorm moved. The modified transport ship crossed the distance with dignity. They plunged right into the center of the purple vortex.

​Reality curved. The stars blurred into streaks. The passage through the gate, usually routine and barely noticeable, this time struck them with the potency of condensed space.

​""Hold on!"" Lena screamed as the purple light flooded the bridge and the artificial gravity groaned under the tidal forces of the tunnel.

​They vanished from the Gitor system, hurtling through subspace straight to the heart of the Empire, to a summons that could mean fortune, or death. But certainly not boredom.

​Reality spat them back into normal space with a quiet, wet smack of physics returning to its course. The purple glow of the tunnel died out, replaced by cold and blackness, but it wasn't the void they expected.

​Kael blinked, trying to regain sharp vision after the jump. He expected the sight of a chaotic trade node, hundreds of container ships, transshipment stations, and orbital dock neon signs. Instead, the Sandstorm was drifting in the shadow of something breathtaking, sense-crushing, and that made a person feel smaller than an atom.

​In front of them, filling almost the entire cockpit visor, a gigantic ring rotated slowly. The structure of dark, matte metal, ten kilometers in diameter, was crisscrossed by veins of blue energy.

​Lena stood up from her seat, as if drawn by an invisible force. She walked to the armored glass, and her face, usually a mask of cynicism, now expressed pure, unadulterated shock.

​""Oh my god..."" she cried out, her voice echoing off the metal walls of the bridge. ""That's the Inner Ring, the Catalyst! The one from the invasion of Ruha'sm!""

​She rested her hand on the cold glass, staring at the titanic structure with a mixture of awe and an old, still-living fury.

​""I saw both of them in orbit around Mars when the Swarm was building them, and just before the Alliance fleet jumped,"" she said softly, her voice hardened by memories. ""I came back defeated from Epsilon Eridani, ready to fight, thirsty for blood and revenge for the loss. And they... they left me in reserve, they didn't send me. I watched the fleet enter the tunnel, watched the best fly off to war, and I stayed home. I was so angry then I wanted to tear my uniform to shreds. And now... now I see the other side of those doors that crossed the tunnel first and appeared here to stabilize the exit.""

​Right next to the gigantic ring, like guardians at the gate of hell, three Swarm units levitated.

​But it wasn't the Gate that turned the blood in Kael and Lena's veins to ice. It was what lay behind it.

​In the distance, against the backdrop of the capital system star Ruha'sm, two light-years away, stretched a sea of lights. But these weren't other stars. They were engines. Reactors. Thousands of reactors.

​""Lena... forget the history,"" Kael rasped, staring at the sensors. ""Look at the background.""

​When Lena's gaze tore itself from the Catalyst and moved to the depths of space, her breath caught.

​It wasn't a fleet. It was an ocean of steel comparable to, or larger than, the one the Alliance deployed for the invasion of Ruha'sm.

​In perfect, geometric formation, stretching for tens of thousands of kilometers, hung the power of the Plague Empire. The entire fleet from the capital system Ruha'sm. 'Avenger'-class battleships with plasma cannons the size of skyscrapers. Heavy cruisers, destroyers, frigates, drone carriers—all arranged in a formation so dense it obscured the light of the local star.

​The Sandstorm's sensors wailed, unable to calculate the signatures. The counter skipped through the thousands. Five thousand... Seven thousand... Nine thousand... Eleven thousand. Lena froze.

​Everything the Empire had to offer in this system was here. Over eleven thousand combat units of all types. More than during the defense against the Alliance. More than had ever been assembled in one place in the known history of the Empire.

​This fleet did not look like one preparing for a parade. It looked like a taut spring. Like a beast just drawing breath before a leap. The gaping muzzles of cannons, the active screen composed of drone formations patrolling the perimeter.

​The small, civilian Sandstorm hung opposite this armada like a fly that had flown into the middle of a hurricane.

​Kael tore his gaze from the terrifying sight. His hands clenched the pilot's seat armrests until his knuckles turned white. He tried to understand why they had been summoned here, bypassing queues, procedures, and the laws of physics.

​He looked at Lena, who was still staring at the steel horizon with a mixture of horror, fear, and military admiration.

​""Oh, fuck..."" Kael swore softly, his words hanging in the silence of the bridge like a sentence. ""Something big is going on, Lena. Something damn big.""

​The silence that fell on the bridge after the discovery of the Imperial armada was only broken by the insistent, skull-drilling signal of the communication console. The sound was sharp, military, brooking no argument—a priority signal that ignored civilian notification blocks.

​Lena, without taking her eyes off the steel horizon formed by the Plague ships, reached out and pressed the reception button with numb fingers.

​The air above the control panel shimmered, and the blue light of the hologram formed a short, technical message, broadcast in a universal, open fleet code:

​""SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETE. TUNNEL OPENING IN 3 MINUTES. DANGER ZONE: 11,000 KM FROM THE RING. ALL CIVILIAN UNITS: CLEAR THE EXIT VECTOR.""

​Kael and Lena looked at the gigantic, ten-kilometer-long Inner Catalyst ring.

​The three Swarm units that had been hanging next to it like dormant insects suddenly came to life. With a grace that belied their size and alien nature, they detached from the Gate structure. They looked like priests finishing the preparation of an altar, making way for something that surpassed even them. They flew to a safe distance, their armor gleaming in the light of the distant star.

​""It's starting,"" Lena whispered, feeling a squeeze in her stomach.

​The space inside the ring began to tremble. This wasn't the usual light of gates powering up. This was a tube driven into the very heart of reality, drawing energy from the Big Bang of another universe—a technology that the Swarm had used on such a scale only once, during the invasion of this system a decade ago. The blackness of space inside the circle gave way to a blinding white, which after a moment swirled, creating a stable, yet terrifying vortex of singularity.

​And then, titans flowed out of this singularity.

​First, pushing aside spacetime with their sheer mass, the Gignian fortresses emerged. Not one, not two. Fifty. Fifty geometric mountains of metal, each weighing a million tons, gliding in perfect formation. Their armor, bristling with X-ray cannons, shone dully, and their braking engines caused gravitational Higgs field tremors perceptible even on the Sandstorm. They looked like gods of geometry who had descended to bring order.

​Right behind them, like a steel river bursting from a dam, the core of the fleet poured forth. Humans.

​The Seven Worlds Defense Guard. Five thousand ships. At the head, like kings of war, sailed the Sparta-class super-battleships and the Thor-class battleships. Behind them, hundreds of Władca (Ruler/Lord) cruisers and a swarm of Młot (Hammer) destroyers. Each one was proof that humanity, a race that barely three hundred years ago was killing itself over scraps of earth, could now challenge the stars. Their hulls shone proudly, carrying thousands of years of history and determination.

​But that was not the end.

​The flanks of the formation were taken by allies. Two thousand Ullaan ships—sleek, black as night, almost invisible against the backdrop of space, resembling obsidian arrowheads. Silent assassins, masters of camouflage, now proudly displaying their power in full light.

​And finally, the K'borrh. One thousand four hundred and fifty units. Aggressive, predatory vzermown frigates, bristling with masers and antennas, looking like a pack of angry wolves released from a cage. Their plasma engines pulsed as if the ships themselves were bloodthirsty.

​Eight and a half thousand Alliance ships.

​They emerged from the tunnel for minutes that felt like hours. When the last one left the event horizon, the Gate went dark, but the space around Ruha'sm was no longer empty. It was crowded with a power that this galaxy had not seen for eons.

​Before Lena and Kael's eyes, something happened that would have been impossible a hundred years ago. Something that defied the logic of their entire service.

​Communication channels, usually encrypted and full of hostile, military jargon, opened wide. Instead of calls for surrender, target acquisition, or threats, the space filled with a cacophony of greetings.

​""This is the Command of the Combined Alliance Fleet, Admiral Marcus Thorne. Reporting arrival."" The human commander's voice was firm, but calm.

​""This is the Command of the Imperial Fleet. We see you, vassals. Welcome to our home."" A harsh, reptilian K'tharr voice replied. ""We begin the phase of integration and crew synchronization. The phase will last about six Imperial months.""

​Lena grabbed the back of the chair, as if she had lost her footing.

​""Vassals? Integration, crew synchronization. What the hell is going on?"" she sputtered. ""Kael, did you hear that? The lizard called Marcus a vassal? We flew here once to slaughter them, and they...""

​The eleven thousand Plague Empire ships, hanging in the distance, and the eight and a half thousand Alliance ships that had just arrived, began a maneuver that made the sensors tremble.

​Two gigantic armadas of many races, once mortal enemies ready to burn each other's worlds, began to merge. Seamlessly, with mathematical precision, the formations interwove. Human destroyers took positions next to Imperial frigates. Gignian fortresses stood shoulder to shoulder with Imperial 'Avenger'-class battleships. Ullaans and K'borrh filled the gaps between the Plague formations.

​They were forming one unimaginable wall of fire and steel. Nineteen and a half thousand ships.

​Lena watched this with wide eyes, which painted a picture of disbelief. A single tear rolled down her cheek, which she didn't even notice.

​""Once... once I chased their remnants to finish them off. We sacrificed destroyers just to kill or damage one of their cruisers,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""And now... now we're one army. Kael, what are they preparing for? What could force the Empire to let the Alliance into its own capital?""

​Kael nodded, feeling the vibrations of thousands of engines resonate with the Sandstorm's hull. He looked into the abyss, toward where the bows of all those ships were pointed. No enemy was visible there, but the very presence of this combined fleet suggested that something was.

​""I don't know, Lena,"" he said quietly, feeling a cold shiver down his spine. ""But whatever it is, it's made eternal enemies join forces. This isn't politics anymore. This is survival. And it looks like this time, no one intends or wants to lose.""

​Briefing Room, Imperial 'Avenger'-class Super-Battleship, Inevitable End.

​The air in the room was thick with cigar smoke and tension that you could cut with a knife. The holographic table displayed a sight that would chill the blood of even veterans: a White Dwarf, a dead star in a distant sector, entangled in a network of mechanical parasites sucking the last remnants of gravitational energy from it. This was not technology they knew. This was the engineering of gods.

​Marcus Thorne stood over the map, leaning on it heavily. His face, despite the nanites, looked old. Not physically—his skin was still smooth—but his eyes were the eyes of a man who had carried the burden of too many corpses and a power that had become a drug on his shoulders for decades.

​He personally slid the data toward Lena and Kael. Recordings from the probe, energy readings, the terrifying scale of the construction.

​""These are the newcomers we will have to contact, and in the worst case, face,"" Marcus said, his voice drained of emotion. ""K'tharr and I want you to command the Guard fleet.""

​Lena raised an eyebrow, still analyzing the matter accretion data.

​""Me?""

​""You will assume operational command of the Guard forces in the Alliance fleet,"" Marcus declared in a tone that brooked no dissent. ""I am a logistician, Lena. I built fleets, managed resources, created defensive doctrines. But I have never commanded in a direct space battle. You have. You survived the chase to Epsilon Eridani, you hunted K'tharr. Besides... the old lizard respects you. He remembers your fury and that antimatter. Your tactics.""

​Lena tore her gaze from the hologram. Her look was cold, analytical.

​""That's an honor, Admiral. But illogical. You have copies of Volkov's consciousness. He has higher seniority, greater experience commanding entire groups. He won the first battle in the Kuiper Belt and the Battle of Earth; he commanded the Alliance invasion of Ruha'sm. His copies commanded fleets securing habitats 1 to 7 of low-oxygen-race systems. He is a Guard legend. Why not him?""

​Marcus flinched. It was a micro-movement, a barely noticeable muscle twitch near his jaw, but Kael, who knew his biological father better than anyone else, caught it instantly.

​""No, Lena,"" Marcus said, the words coming out with difficulty, as if they were made of lead. ""We have a copy of Volkov's consciousness, it's true. But it's outdated. The one before 2202. Before the great departure of the Alliance Fleet through the Gate.""

​Silence fell in the room.

​""The real Volkov... the one who led the fleet to the other side, who died here, in orbit around Ruha'sm, in 2206,"" Marcus continued, looking at the table surface. ""His ship, the Invincible, evaporated when Dmitry covered an allied Swarm unit. There was no body. The original Dmitry is gone. We only have the 'clean' Volkov. The one from the day of departure. The one who didn't see the end of that battle and the war.""

​Kael stepped forward. His eyes narrowed. ""So when the truce came and you learned of his death from Imperial data, you didn't print his copy! ""This was over a hundred and forty years ago, Marcus,"" he shouted, a threat in his voice. ""All these years, during the truce with the Empire, when you were building your regime on Earth... you had that copy. 'Clean' Volkov is still a tactical genius. He could have been printed, he could have been perfecting his training. So why didn't you print him, Marcus?"" Kael asked with a reproach that cut the air like a whip.

​Marcus was silent for a moment. In his mind appeared the image of Dmitry Volkov. Not the one from the monuments, but the one of flesh and blood, who yelled at him in the office after the Steinberg experiments affair. The one who called him a monster whenever his dictatorial and authoritarian tendencies took control of him.

​""Because he always questioned my methods,"" Marcus whispered, and for the first time in a long time, there was fear in his voice. ""He was stubborn. Moral. Peace came with the Empire, there was no... need to resurrect him, risk destabilizing the government, the Guard's order.""

​""No need?!"" Kael exploded. He walked up to the Admiral and jabbed him in the chest with his finger, ignoring protocol, rank, and history. ""You bastard... You didn't embody his copy out of convenience! You did it because you found out he died, and you felt relief! He died, so he didn't watch what you did later! You didn't print him out of fear of power!""

​Marcus backed away, pale as a sheet. Kael hit the nail on the head.

​This was his greatest, hidden fear. The Volkov of 2202 knew a harsh Marcus, but he didn't know Marcus the butcher. The Volkov copy didn't know about the year 2273. About the Eternal Spark Uprising. About Marcus's order to bombard the impoverished districts. About the two hundred million dead civilians Marcus sacrificed ""for stability.""

​""It was a historical necessity..."" Marcus tried to defend himself, but it sounded pathetic.

​""It was murder by omission!"" Kael shouted. ""You condemned him to non-existence because you were afraid of his judgment! Now you have a problem, Marcus. You have a goddamn problem. Because if you embodied him now... if you took him out of the ice after a century and a half... he would wake up in a world you built on corpses.""

​Kael looked around the throne room, at the alien technologies, at the Plague allies.

​""He would wake up and ask, 'Marcus, what happened while I was gone?' And you would have to tell him you gave the order to exterminate your own species. That you became what he fought against all his life. He wouldn't understand anything. And when he did understand..."" Kael smiled bitterly. ""He would destroy you, Marcus. Not the White Dwarf. Volkov would destroy you with a single look. You would awaken your own conscience, which would come to strangle you.""

​Marcus Thorne stood in silence, defeated by the truth. He knew Kael was right. Volkov was a man of principle. If the ""clean"" Dmitry learned about the 2273 massacre, he would lead a rebellion against Marcus five minutes after waking up.

​""That's why you will command, Lena,"" Marcus said hoarsely, looking away and escaping into map analysis. ""Volkov... Volkov must remain a legend. A dead, untarnished legend. For the good of all of us. And for my safety.""

Chapter 1: Lena and Kael.

​Earth Time: May 14, 2348

​Gitor System, Plague Empire territory

​Distance from Earth: 342 light years

​The darkness of space outside the Sandstorm's viewports was thick with movement. Thousands of navigation lights—from powerful bulk carriers barely squeezing through the 50-meter diameter gates to nimble courier frigates—formed a river of metal, slowly flowing toward a silvery point in the distance: the 'Needle' Gate. A galactic bottleneck through which the life, goods, and greed of the entire sector spilled.

​Inside the Sandstorm, a modified Viper-class transport, however, there was an order that would have been impossible just a year ago.

​Kael Thorne entered the mess, holding two steaming mugs. These weren't the sealed containers with tubes they had to use during decades of service in the Guard and on their old ship. These were real, ceramic mugs, in which liquid behaved as it should—steaming upwards and staying at the bottom.

​He placed the coffee in front of Lena Kowalska, who was sitting with her feet propped up on the navigation console, reviewing cargo manifests.

​""I didn't want to install it; I begrudged the Imperial credits,"" Kael grumbled, sitting heavily in a chair that sank under his weight instead of pushing him up. ""But damn, now that you can drink coffee from a normal mug and not worry about a drop flying into your eye or shorting out a control panel... it changes everything. A mop and a brush stood in the corner of the mess, and a bucket was filled with water. Kael looked in that direction with a smile on his face.""

​Lena laughed scornfully, not taking her eyes off the screen. Despite the years, her face still looked young thanks to the nanites, but a veteran's cynical amusement lurked in her eyes.

​""I told you it would improve our quality of life. Especially during these damn long transfer queues,"" she replied, taking a sip. ""Expensive, yes, but the Empire's gravity generator is a game-changer, Earth gravity throughout the crew compartment. Sweet. You can even piss like a human, not an astronaut.""

​Kael nodded, savoring the taste of real Arabica, another luxury they could afford.

​""How's the queue for the Needle? Much longer?"" he asked, glancing at the external tactical display.

​""About three hundred and fifty ships ahead of us,"" Lena sighed. ""So, about seven to eight hours of boredom, if the Swarm maintains the transfer speed.""

​In the Sandstorm's cargo hold, beneath a layer of legal mining machinery parts, rested ten tons of Filopi. It was an unassuming, purple plant that grew only on the planet Gitor. To humans, it was a useless weed, but to the L'thaarr race, overworked in Imperial shipyards and offices, its hallucinogenic properties were the only solace. They would pay any price for it.

​""Hope this transponder turns out to be right and they don't do a random search,"" Kael muttered, feeling that specific squeeze in his stomach that accompanied every smuggler. ""If they discover the Filopi, we'll end up in an Imperial prison for years. Filopi was legal in the Empire, but not paying taxes on the future transaction was not.""

​Lena smiled faintly, turning an Imperial code card between her fingers.

​""Relax. Ta'hirim has never failed us. She gave us the highest-level trade codes. Besides..."" Lena looked at him meaningfully. ""She has a soft spot for you. You sly dog.""

​Kael choked on his coffee.

​""I was drunk, Lena!"" he snapped, feeling his cheeks burn. ""And I mean really drunk. That was after we celebrated our success on Vega Station.""

​""I know, I know,"" Lena waved her hand, enjoying the situation. ""But to hook up with a female of the Plague race? And do it so well that now, whenever she sees you on a video link, she bares those sharp teeth like a teenager?""

​""First of all, Lena,"" Kael pointed a finger at her, trying to maintain seriousness, ""she used me. She wanted to know what it was like with us. And without my Hoplite armor, I didn't have a chance to resist.""

​Lena snorted with laughter, nearly spilling her coffee. ""You always liked the predatory ones, after all.""

​""Technical details aside, you rogue, but you must have enjoyed her foreplay, otherwise your dick wouldn't have stood up.""

​Kael groaned, burying his face in his hands while Lena laughed scornfully. However, her laughter was brutally interrupted.

​A red light flooded the bridge. The wail of an alarm pierced the air. Both instantly ran to the bridge.

​""Damn it!"" Lena instantly switched to combat mode. Her fingers flew across the console. ""Control! They're actively scanning us! Penetrating beam!""

​""The transponder was junk?"" Kael yelled, scrambling toward the defensive systems. ""Did Ta'hirim betray us or get caught?""

​""I don't know.""

​On the main screen, transmitting the external camera view, a shadow appeared. It was fast, predatory, and dangerous. A ship burst out of deep space, braking hard right next to the line of civilian vessels. It wasn't a typical frigate or destroyer.

​""That's an Imperial 'Talon' class pocket battleship,"" Lena recognized the design instantly. Her voice hardened. ""The latest generation. Full automation, crew reduced to a minimum, nothing but combat systems. That's not a customs officer, Kael. That's an enforcer.""

​The Plague ship hung in the void like a bird of prey. Its energy cannons glowed blue, ready to fire. The scanner beam swept over the ships in the queue, mercilessly stripping them of their secrets.

​""Oh, crap..."" Kael whispered. ""They're looking for someone. Scanning everyone. If they find the Filopi...""

​""We can't run,"" Lena assessed coolly. ""In this queue, before we spool up the Higgs engines, they'll turn us into a cloud of plasma. We sit and we pray.""

​The scanner beam hit the Sandstorm. The ship shuddered, systems howled a warning. They waited for the verdict. For the shot that would tear the hull apart, or the order to board.

​Instead, a voice came through the speakers. It was the harsh, synthesized language of the Empire, hard and commanding.

​""Unit Sandstorm. We know you are using a counterfeit transponder. Your signature has been identified. Lena Kowalska and Kael Thorne. Do not attempt to escape.""

​Kael looked at Lena, his hand instinctively reaching for the pistol hidden under the console.

​""This is it,"" he muttered.

​However, the voice continued, and the tone of the command changed into something nobody expected.

​""Lena Kowalska. Prepare to approach the Trade Gate. You are bypassing the queue. You have priority transit status.""

​Lena blinked, looking at Kael.

​""What the hell?"" Kael asked, taking his hand off the weapon. ""No arrest? No boarding?""

​""Wait..."" Lena stared at the sensor readings.

​Something incredible was happening around them. The Imperial 'Talon' battleship fired a series of signal flares. Hundreds of patiently waiting ships began frantically firing their plasma maneuvering thrusters, moving aside. In the dense crowd of ships, a perfectly empty corridor opened up, leading straight to the silvery disk of the gate.

​""They gave us a corridor..."" Lena whispered in disbelief. ""All the waiting transports are making way for us. Like we're some kind of damn dignitaries.""

​""Holy hell, what is going on?"" Kael watched as powerful, kilometer-long bulk carriers moved out of the way for their small smuggler ship.

​""Sandstorm. Proceed to the gate. A direct tunnel to Ruha'sm will open shortly. Only your unit has the right of passage.""

​""Ruha'sm?"" Lena looked at Kael. ""The Empire's capital? Direct? We don't have a direct connection from here! We'd have to jump through three nodes!""

​The 'Needle' Gate in front of them began to pulse. The standard blue light of the event horizon, which led to the trade node, suddenly went out. The gate became black, dead. Hundreds of ships in the queue froze.

​And then, inside the fifty-meter diameter ring, a new light ignited. Not blue. Purple. Intense, royal, terrifying.

​The energy needed to reconfigure the tunnel over such a gigantic distance, outside of the standard schedule, was astronomical. It was a waste of resources, of antimatter, that only someone with absolute authority could afford.

​""They're shutting down standard traffic for the whole sector... just for us,"" Kael said, feeling a chill down his spine. ""Someone very, very much wants to see us in the capital. And immediately.""

​Lena gripped the controls. Her face was a mask of focus.

​""Doesn't matter who. If they give you a highway, you take it. Kael, strap in. This is going to be a rough jump. This is not a standard tunnel.""

​The Sandstorm moved. The modified transport ship crossed the distance with dignity. They plunged right into the center of the purple vortex.

​Reality curved. The stars blurred into streaks. The passage through the gate, usually routine and barely noticeable, this time struck them with the potency of condensed space.

​""Hold on!"" Lena screamed as the purple light flooded the bridge and the artificial gravity groaned under the tidal forces of the tunnel.

​They vanished from the Gitor system, hurtling through subspace straight to the heart of the Empire, to a summons that could mean fortune, or death. But certainly not boredom.

​Reality spat them back into normal space with a quiet, wet smack of physics returning to its course. The purple glow of the tunnel died out, replaced by cold and blackness, but it wasn't the void they expected.

​Kael blinked, trying to regain sharp vision after the jump. He expected the sight of a chaotic trade node, hundreds of container ships, transshipment stations, and orbital dock neon signs. Instead, the Sandstorm was drifting in the shadow of something breathtaking, sense-crushing, and that made a person feel smaller than an atom.

​In front of them, filling almost the entire cockpit visor, a gigantic ring rotated slowly. The structure of dark, matte metal, ten kilometers in diameter, was crisscrossed by veins of blue energy.

​Lena stood up from her seat, as if drawn by an invisible force. She walked to the armored glass, and her face, usually a mask of cynicism, now expressed pure, unadulterated shock.

​""Oh my god..."" she cried out, her voice echoing off the metal walls of the bridge. ""That's the Inner Ring, the Catalyst! The one from the invasion of Ruha'sm!""

​She rested her hand on the cold glass, staring at the titanic structure with a mixture of awe and an old, still-living fury.

​""I saw both of them in orbit around Mars when the Swarm was building them, and just before the Alliance fleet jumped,"" she said softly, her voice hardened by memories. ""I came back defeated from Epsilon Eridani, ready to fight, thirsty for blood and revenge for the loss. And they... they left me in reserve, they didn't send me. I watched the fleet enter the tunnel, watched the best fly off to war, and I stayed home. I was so angry then I wanted to tear my uniform to shreds. And now... now I see the other side of those doors that crossed the tunnel first and appeared here to stabilize the exit.""

​Right next to the gigantic ring, like guardians at the gate of hell, three Swarm units levitated.

​But it wasn't the Gate that turned the blood in Kael and Lena's veins to ice. It was what lay behind it.

​In the distance, against the backdrop of the capital system star Ruha'sm, two light-years away, stretched a sea of lights. But these weren't other stars. They were engines. Reactors. Thousands of reactors.

​""Lena... forget the history,"" Kael rasped, staring at the sensors. ""Look at the background.""

​When Lena's gaze tore itself from the Catalyst and moved to the depths of space, her breath caught.

​It wasn't a fleet. It was an ocean of steel comparable to, or larger than, the one the Alliance deployed for the invasion of Ruha'sm.

​In perfect, geometric formation, stretching for tens of thousands of kilometers, hung the power of the Plague Empire. The entire fleet from the capital system Ruha'sm. 'Avenger'-class battleships with plasma cannons the size of skyscrapers. Heavy cruisers, destroyers, frigates, drone carriers—all arranged in a formation so dense it obscured the light of the local star.

​The Sandstorm's sensors wailed, unable to calculate the signatures. The counter skipped through the thousands. Five thousand... Seven thousand... Nine thousand... Eleven thousand. Lena froze.

​Everything the Empire had to offer in this system was here. Over eleven thousand combat units of all types. More than during the defense against the Alliance. More than had ever been assembled in one place in the known history of the Empire.

​This fleet did not look like one preparing for a parade. It looked like a taut spring. Like a beast just drawing breath before a leap. The gaping muzzles of cannons, the active screen composed of drone formations patrolling the perimeter.

​The small, civilian Sandstorm hung opposite this armada like a fly that had flown into the middle of a hurricane.

​Kael tore his gaze from the terrifying sight. His hands clenched the pilot's seat armrests until his knuckles turned white. He tried to understand why they had been summoned here, bypassing queues, procedures, and the laws of physics.

​He looked at Lena, who was still staring at the steel horizon with a mixture of horror, fear, and military admiration.

​""Oh, fuck..."" Kael swore softly, his words hanging in the silence of the bridge like a sentence. ""Something big is going on, Lena. Something damn big.""

​The silence that fell on the bridge after the discovery of the Imperial armada was only broken by the insistent, skull-drilling signal of the communication console. The sound was sharp, military, brooking no argument—a priority signal that ignored civilian notification blocks.

​Lena, without taking her eyes off the steel horizon formed by the Plague ships, reached out and pressed the reception button with numb fingers.

​The air above the control panel shimmered, and the blue light of the hologram formed a short, technical message, broadcast in a universal, open fleet code:

​""SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETE. TUNNEL OPENING IN 3 MINUTES. DANGER ZONE: 11,000 KM FROM THE RING. ALL CIVILIAN UNITS: CLEAR THE EXIT VECTOR.""

​Kael and Lena looked at the gigantic, ten-kilometer-long Inner Catalyst ring.

​The three Swarm units that had been hanging next to it like dormant insects suddenly came to life. With a grace that belied their size and alien nature, they detached from the Gate structure. They looked like priests finishing the preparation of an altar, making way for something that surpassed even them. They flew to a safe distance, their armor gleaming in the light of the distant star.

​""It's starting,"" Lena whispered, feeling a squeeze in her stomach.

​The space inside the ring began to tremble. This wasn't the usual light of gates powering up. This was a tube driven into the very heart of reality, drawing energy from the Big Bang of another universe—a technology that the Swarm had used on such a scale only once, during the invasion of this system a decade ago. The blackness of space inside the circle gave way to a blinding white, which after a moment swirled, creating a stable, yet terrifying vortex of singularity.

​And then, titans flowed out of this singularity.

​First, pushing aside spacetime with their sheer mass, the Gignian fortresses emerged. Not one, not two. Fifty. Fifty geometric mountains of metal, each weighing a million tons, gliding in perfect formation. Their armor, bristling with X-ray cannons, shone dully, and their braking engines caused gravitational Higgs field tremors perceptible even on the Sandstorm. They looked like gods of geometry who had descended to bring order.

​Right behind them, like a steel river bursting from a dam, the core of the fleet poured forth. Humans.

​The Seven Worlds Defense Guard. Five thousand ships. At the head, like kings of war, sailed the Sparta-class super-battleships and the Thor-class battleships. Behind them, hundreds of Władca (Ruler/Lord) cruisers and a swarm of Młot (Hammer) destroyers. Each one was proof that humanity, a race that barely three hundred years ago was killing itself over scraps of earth, could now challenge the stars. Their hulls shone proudly, carrying thousands of years of history and determination.

​But that was not the end.

​The flanks of the formation were taken by allies. Two thousand Ullaan ships—sleek, black as night, almost invisible against the backdrop of space, resembling obsidian arrowheads. Silent assassins, masters of camouflage, now proudly displaying their power in full light.

​And finally, the K'borrh. One thousand four hundred and fifty units. Aggressive, predatory vzermown frigates, bristling with masers and antennas, looking like a pack of angry wolves released from a cage. Their plasma engines pulsed as if the ships themselves were bloodthirsty.

​Eight and a half thousand Alliance ships.

​They emerged from the tunnel for minutes that felt like hours. When the last one left the event horizon, the Gate went dark, but the space around Ruha'sm was no longer empty. It was crowded with a power that this galaxy had not seen for eons.

​Before Lena and Kael's eyes, something happened that would have been impossible a hundred years ago. Something that defied the logic of their entire service.

​Communication channels, usually encrypted and full of hostile, military jargon, opened wide. Instead of calls for surrender, target acquisition, or threats, the space filled with a cacophony of greetings.

​""This is the Command of the Combined Alliance Fleet, Admiral Marcus Thorne. Reporting arrival."" The human commander's voice was firm, but calm.

​""This is the Command of the Imperial Fleet. We see you, vassals. Welcome to our home."" A harsh, reptilian K'tharr voice replied. ""We begin the phase of integration and crew synchronization. The phase will last about six Imperial months.""

​Lena grabbed the back of the chair, as if she had lost her footing.

​""Vassals? Integration, crew synchronization. What the hell is going on?"" she sputtered. ""Kael, did you hear that? The lizard called Marcus a vassal? We flew here once to slaughter them, and they...""

​The eleven thousand Plague Empire ships, hanging in the distance, and the eight and a half thousand Alliance ships that had just arrived, began a maneuver that made the sensors tremble.

​Two gigantic armadas of many races, once mortal enemies ready to burn each other's worlds, began to merge. Seamlessly, with mathematical precision, the formations interwove. Human destroyers took positions next to Imperial frigates. Gignian fortresses stood shoulder to shoulder with Imperial 'Avenger'-class battleships. Ullaans and K'borrh filled the gaps between the Plague formations.

​They were forming one unimaginable wall of fire and steel. Nineteen and a half thousand ships.

​Lena watched this with wide eyes, which painted a picture of disbelief. A single tear rolled down her cheek, which she didn't even notice.

​""Once... once I chased their remnants to finish them off. We sacrificed destroyers just to kill or damage one of their cruisers,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""And now... now we're one army. Kael, what are they preparing for? What could force the Empire to let the Alliance into its own capital?""

​Kael nodded, feeling the vibrations of thousands of engines resonate with the Sandstorm's hull. He looked into the abyss, toward where the bows of all those ships were pointed. No enemy was visible there, but the very presence of this combined fleet suggested that something was.

​""I don't know, Lena,"" he said quietly, feeling a cold shiver down his spine. ""But whatever it is, it's made eternal enemies join forces. This isn't politics anymore. This is survival. And it looks like this time, no one intends or wants to lose.""

​Briefing Room, Imperial 'Avenger'-class Super-Battleship, Inevitable End.

​The air in the room was thick with cigar smoke and tension that you could cut with a knife. The holographic table displayed a sight that would chill the blood of even veterans: a White Dwarf, a dead star in a distant sector, entangled in a network of mechanical parasites sucking the last remnants of gravitational energy from it. This was not technology they knew. This was the engineering of gods.

​Marcus Thorne stood over the map, leaning on it heavily. His face, despite the nanites, looked old. Not physically—his skin was still smooth—but his eyes were the eyes of a man who had carried the burden of too many corpses and a power that had become a drug on his shoulders for decades.

​He personally slid the data toward Lena and Kael. Recordings from the probe, energy readings, the terrifying scale of the construction.

​""These are the newcomers we will have to contact, and in the worst case, face,"" Marcus said, his voice drained of emotion. ""K'tharr and I want you to command the Guard fleet.""

​Lena raised an eyebrow, still analyzing the matter accretion data.

​""Me?""

​""You will assume operational command of the Guard forces in the Alliance fleet,"" Marcus declared in a tone that brooked no dissent. ""I am a logistician, Lena. I built fleets, managed resources, created defensive doctrines. But I have never commanded in a direct space battle. You have. You survived the chase to Epsilon Eridani, you hunted K'tharr. Besides... the old lizard respects you. He remembers your fury and that antimatter. Your tactics.""

​Lena tore her gaze from the hologram. Her look was cold, analytical.

​""That's an honor, Admiral. But illogical. You have copies of Volkov's consciousness. He has higher seniority, greater experience commanding entire groups. He won the first battle in the Kuiper Belt and the Battle of Earth; he commanded the Alliance invasion of Ruha'sm. His copies commanded fleets securing habitats 1 to 7 of low-oxygen-race systems. He is a Guard legend. Why not him?""

​Marcus flinched. It was a micro-movement, a barely noticeable muscle twitch near his jaw, but Kael, who knew his biological father better than anyone else, caught it instantly.

​""No, Lena,"" Marcus said, the words coming out with difficulty, as if they were made of lead. ""We have a copy of Volkov's consciousness, it's true. But it's outdated. The one before 2202. Before the great departure of the Alliance Fleet through the Gate.""

​Silence fell in the room.

​""The real Volkov... the one who led the fleet to the other side, who died here, in orbit around Ruha'sm, in 2206,"" Marcus continued, looking at the table surface. ""His ship, the Invincible, evaporated when Dmitry covered an allied Swarm unit. There was no body. The original Dmitry is gone. We only have the 'clean' Volkov. The one from the day of departure. The one who didn't see the end of that battle and the war.""

​Kael stepped forward. His eyes narrowed. ""So when the truce came and you learned of his death from Imperial data, you didn't print his copy! ""This was over a hundred and forty years ago, Marcus,"" he shouted, a threat in his voice. ""All these years, during the truce with the Empire, when you were building your regime on Earth... you had that copy. 'Clean' Volkov is still a tactical genius. He could have been printed, he could have been perfecting his training. So why didn't you print him, Marcus?"" Kael asked with a reproach that cut the air like a whip.

​Marcus was silent for a moment. In his mind appeared the image of Dmitry Volkov. Not the one from the monuments, but the one of flesh and blood, who yelled at him in the office after the Steinberg experiments affair. The one who called him a monster whenever his dictatorial and authoritarian tendencies took control of him.

​""Because he always questioned my methods,"" Marcus whispered, and for the first time in a long time, there was fear in his voice. ""He was stubborn. Moral. Peace came with the Empire, there was no... need to resurrect him, risk destabilizing the government, the Guard's order.""

​""No need?!"" Kael exploded. He walked up to the Admiral and jabbed him in the chest with his finger, ignoring protocol, rank, and history. ""You bastard... You didn't embody his copy out of convenience! You did it because you found out he died, and you felt relief! He died, so he didn't watch what you did later! You didn't print him out of fear of power!""

​Marcus backed away, pale as a sheet. Kael hit the nail on the head.

​This was his greatest, hidden fear. The Volkov of 2202 knew a harsh Marcus, but he didn't know Marcus the butcher. The Volkov copy didn't know about the year 2273. About the Eternal Spark Uprising. About Marcus's order to bombard the impoverished districts. About the two hundred million dead civilians Marcus sacrificed ""for stability.""

​""It was a historical necessity..."" Marcus tried to defend himself, but it sounded pathetic.

​""It was murder by omission!"" Kael shouted. ""You condemned him to non-existence because you were afraid of his judgment! Now you have a problem, Marcus. You have a goddamn problem. Because if you embodied him now... if you took him out of the ice after a century and a half... he would wake up in a world you built on corpses.""

​Kael looked around the throne room, at the alien technologies, at the Plague allies.

​""He would wake up and ask, 'Marcus, what happened while I was gone?' And you would have to tell him you gave the order to exterminate your own species. That you became what he fought against all his life. He wouldn't understand anything. And when he did understand..."" Kael smiled bitterly. ""He would destroy you, Marcus. Not the White Dwarf. Volkov would destroy you with a single look. You would awaken your own conscience, which would come to strangle you.""

​Marcus Thorne stood in silence, defeated by the truth. He knew Kael was right. Volkov was a man of principle. If the ""clean"" Dmitry learned about the 2273 massacre, he would lead a rebellion against Marcus five minutes after waking up.

The cups were always lined up, waiting for their next refill. Hour after hour, the place felt less like a workplace and more like kids swapping ghost stories around a campfire—except the “ghosts” were old jobs, half-finished boards, and scribbled notes covering every whiteboard in sight.

There was an electric charge in the air, the kind that makes the hair on your neck stand up. No one ever focused on just one project; the techs bounced between three or four at a time like it was nothing. How they stayed locked in with the amount of caffeine they consumed was a mystery—cups of coffee, cans of energy drinks, and caffeine pills stuffed in their pockets like spare parts.

Nothing sat idle. No console, no board, no experiment was left waiting. Everything got powered on, poked at, broken down, and pushed to its limits. Watching them juggle it all at once was unreal—one idea sparking another, each problem branching into three more, the whole lab buzzing with it.

We kept saying we needed rules, that the crew needed sleep, but they never listened. With the amount of caffeine they put away—eight cups of coffee easily adding up to hundreds of milligrams—they made sleeping pills look like decorations. They drank it like water, the caffeine practically hard-wired into their brains. At some point, you had to wonder if they were even human or just some caffeine-powered robots keeping the machines alive by sheer will.

Every plan they made was written out, dissected, and rebuilt. They combed through every detail, hunting errors before they had the chance to surface. And when a problem did sneak its way in, they didn’t freeze or panic—they tore into it and made it part of the process.

So as you cook dinner or if you're listening on the ride home, if you're driving past our small little town and pick us up on the radio, you might wanna listen in because this one's a doozy.”

“They say when you fall in love. It's like you hear music in the air, well, that's not how I felt. I was hot, in a crowded, loud restaurant with waiters running around left and right. On my third “date” with some guy who was loudly talking about how much money he makes. He was unimpressive online and pathetic in person, and while he kept boasting to the unimpressed waitress, I realized he only 3 topics of conversation: how much money he has, why crypto is the future, and what the possibility of us fucking tonight was … in his words, “I know you women have that third date rule”. I really didn't give a fuck about him, but after 2 dates and 20 voicemails, with him begging to see me again,  because I was “different” and “easy to be with”. Whatever the fuck that meant. Here I was. I knew I didn't like him, but a free meal is a free meal.

 It was a cold, dark night. The sound of my heels clicking sounded off the pavement. Wanting to get home as soon as possible, I cut through Angelus Park. My thoughts floated back to my date as I made my way through the playground. I was upset. What should've been a romantic walk home was now a speed walk in the dark. I mean, I’m a 33 year old single woman, with a great job, my own home, and no kids. And what’s my prize? Dates with every Tom, Dick, and Brandon, who can’t finish a conversation without looking at another woman’s tits. Putting myself through dating hell to make a dead woman happy. 

  Out of everything she could’ve asked on her deathbed. “Don't disappoint me again, find a good husband.” Thinking about her words angered me even more. She always held me to a different standard than my brother, but those were her dying words to a 15-year-old. I knew what she meant, “Don’t be alone for the rest of your life,” but it cut deep. Weren’t my accomplishments enough? I was deep in my thoughts. When a white flash shot in front of my eyes. Confused I looked around, then I looked up for a moment, wondering if it was lightning.  I felt myself die a little on the inside. Just what I needed. Rain , and after I just got my hair done too. I picked up the pace, trying to get out of the park and to my building. When I noticed something odd. The statue that normally adorned the fountain in the middle of the park was gone. 

  I looked at the empty space for a moment. I felt uncomfortable as a thought crept into my mind. A memory. My mom, my brother, and I at this very park. I remembered playing on the swings. I saw myself jumping off the highest point, but I didn't land. I fell on the ground face-first. I heard it before I felt it. A crack on the side of my head and, the feeling of blood running down my face. I looked around for my mom and my brother, but they were gone. I cried. Loud shrieking sobs begging for my mommy. When she finally did come, she didn't rush over; she didn't check on me to see if I was okay. She scowled at me and told me, “Stop being dramatic, it's just a scratch”. I felt her roughly grab my arm and drag me away. “You are such an attention seeker, just wait till we get home.” The whole ride home she ignored me she just kept talking to my brother like I wasn’t there. 

 Suddenly, a throbbing headache rang in my head, the air around me felt fuzzy, and my mouth felt dry as my eyes struggled to focus. “Did that fucking creep slip me something?” Another flash of lightning burst in front of me. My head felt like it was spinning. I was disoriented, struggling to find my footing. My heels wobbling on the ground beneath me. I almost walked into another flash of light. It was too close for comfort. The air around me was getting thick and hot as it flashed in front of my eyes, I swear I saw something but it was too fast for my brain to register. I started walking faster when a sound came from behind me. My feet still tumbling on one another as my brain and heart pounded in my ears. The park lights started exploding, going out one by one and leaving me in darkness. I ran. There was a steady rumbling behind me, like stone on pavement. It shook both the ground and air. I ran as fast as I could until I made it out of the park.

 I refused to look behind me. The entirety of the run home, I felt someone watching me, but I didn't turn around to see who or what it was. When I finally made it to my apartment, I kept the lights off and covered all the windows with curtains. As I closed the last window, something caught my eye. At the top of the building across the street, a large pale angelic figure. It was glowing under the large moon. I stared at it for a moment when my stomach began to lurch. My eyes went wide as I realized what it was and shut the blinds.

 The next morning, I woke up surprisingly chipper. Momentarily forgetting last night's events. I’d slept the best I’d slept in months. I realized I even had time to stop at the coffee shop before I went to work. When I walked down the street, I felt different. The air felt fresher. The world looked so vibrant. I felt like I was floating in the air. I even found myself humming a little tune as I walked into the coffee shop.

 It was busy when I walked in. As I waited in line, the smell of roasted beans and baked goods filled the air around me. The speakers were quietly playing Frank Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” in the background. I smiled to myself, what a cute coincidence. That’s what I was humming on my way here. 

 The boy at the counter looked exhausted. Heavy bags under his eyes. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Not really a shock, though everyone knew about his dad's sudden illness. I’d be exhausted if I were him, balancing college and running a whole store at the same time while taking care of my dad. I gave him a smile as I ordered and tipped him 5$. I stepped off to the side to wait for my order.

 I watch as people come in and out of the coffee shop while I wait for my food. When in walks the most handsome man I’d ever seen. Tall, with green eyes and curly dark hair. The way he walked got my attention. Head held high and confident, smiling as he walked up to the counter and put in his order. A strong arm handed the barista his card. I realized I'd been staring too long when he locked eyes with me. My face flushed red as I looked away. I looked out the side of my eyes, pretending I was on my phone. Everyone else faded out of the way when he moved over to the pickup area. My heart beat in time to the song playing on the speakers.

*Dum - dum dum- dum- dum dum*

  There it was. Clear as day, that melody they speak of. The world got quiet.

“You're just too good to be true, can’t take my eyes off of you.”

 “Kelsey, right?” said the man as he approached. “Huh,” I said, coming back down to earth. He laughed. “You live in the riverside apartments, right?” I nodded, taken aback by his deep voice. “Sorry, is that weird? I wasn't trying to be creepy .” He said confidently, “I’m Jason. I’ve seen you in the lobby.” He said, taking a cursory glance down my body and licking his lips. “I live on the 5th floor.” He says, flashing me a grin. I felt like we were the only people here. If this handsome stranger says we’ve seen each other, who am I to correct him?  “Oh yeah, I've seen you before,” I said convincingly.
 
 “Sooooo?” He trailed off, a brow raised. I looked at him for a moment when it hit me, “Um yeah, Kelsey, thats~a~me” I laughed nervously before clearing my throat, “ That’s me,” I repeated, mentally facepalming myself. He looked at me for a moment, deeply gazing into my eyes. Was this it? Could it be…Love at first sight? “I hope you don’t find this strange, but ever since I saw you this morning. I can’t get you out of my head. I was wondering if I could take you out?” He asked. I thought for a moment. Before I could answer, my name was called. My food was ready. 

 “How about this?” I said, picking up a napkin and pulling a pen out of my bag to write down my number. “ Text me,” I said, giving him the napkin, then quickly grabbing my tea and croissant, heading off before I was late for work. The rest of the day was normal. Yet that feeling of walking on air intensified. And I found myself humming that song around the office. We texted all day and made plans to hang out later that night. Each message, each laugh, each flirtation raised the proverbial volume in my head. I felt electric, almost like every piece of me, even the air, was full of static.

“You’d be like heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much, at long last love has arrived”.

 I felt nervous as I got ready, giddy even. I mean, this guy was hot, and he seemed cool. I looked at myself in the mirror as I did the last few touches to my outfit. I look good. Not too covered, not too slutty, the Samantha Jones special, I thought as I walked over to the vanity to put on some perfume.

  As I finished getting ready, it occurred to me, what if tonight was the night I made my mom happy? “Dont disappoint me again, find a good husband.” Her words rang through my head yet again, this time reaching over the song that had been stuck in my mind all day. It sent a cold chill down my spine. “Don’t be alone for the rest of your life,” my subconscious repeated. 

 The room started getting brighter as my mom's voice echoed in my head. I looked around in confusion as the light bulbs on my vanity got so bright I could hardly look at them, then the light next to my mirror burst. I jumped, turning to look at the lamp. As I got up, the vanity lights followed after it. One after another until the only working light left was the one in the living room. I had a flashback to last night, the park, the street lights burst the exact same way. I felt my head start throbbing. I put my hand on my head, trying to dull the pain. I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths. “Everything's going to be okay,” I thought to myself.

 When I opened my eyes, I screamed. A statue version of my mom stood behind me. Pale and tall, it loomed over me. It looked just like her, but with some slight differences. The longer I stared, I noticed how her features were slightly off. They looked like they were sliding off her face. They moved slowly and would snap back up like it were tracking my eye movements. I looked behind me, but there was nothing there. When I turned back, she stood closer, almost expressionless. I could feel the heat of her stone body radiating on my back. And her face…she had that big ugly scowl. I'd seen that look many times before; it's the same face she’d make when I’d get in trouble as a child. The same face she had in her hospital bed. She stood still, looking directly at me, her features slowly began to shift and merge one on top of the other. I stared at her in the mirror. When I heard her voice in my ear, “Your brother was always the better listener,” she said in a sickeningly sweet whisper. I felt anger rise in me. I threw the perfume bottle I held in my hand, making the mirror shatter in front of me.

 I had no doubt I was imagining things. I was stressed and nervous, that’s all. Two highly conflicting emotions making me see things that aren't there. Yet as I looked at the shattered glass on the floor. A part of me knew I should be scared, but I wasn’t; all I felt was anger. I saw her looking at me in the broken pieces. Different angles of her marbled face stared at me, all with different versions of that scowl. I ran out of my apartment, locking the door behind me and taking a moment to catch my breath, when a message popped up on my phone. 

“Wya?”

 I looked down at my phone, and I felt myself calm down. A huge smile spread on my lips as our song began playing in my head once more.

“Omw"" 

“Pardon the way that I stare. There’s nothing else to compare.”

 I made my way upstairs. I smoothed my dress down before knocking on his door. It felt like hours before he opened it. I found myself humming absentmindedly as I waited. My mom's words were still running through my head, her disappointed face popping through white flashes every time I blinked, but I knew I was doing the right thing. 

 When he opened the door, the world stopped. I felt short of breath. He looked perfect. Frank Valli’s voice floated out of his apartment. I smiled at him, feeling nervous and excited. I wondered if he’d had the song stuck in his head all day, too. “Come in, you look beautiful.”

 “ Thank you “ I said as I stepped in “I’ve had this song stuck in my head all day too” he looked at me for moment, like he was confused, but he smiled as he closed the door behind me. When I stepped inside. It was small. I felt slightly disappointed. I had thought he was distinguished and tasteful, the type to have artwork on his walls and leather couches, with whiskey and oak scented candles. Yet before me was a ceiling-to-floor collection of Funko Pops. It was messy and cramped, a pile of dirty clothes lazily tucked away in the closet. Posters of over sexualized anime girls stared me down. The carpet was stained, making crunching sounds as I walked. I tried to hide my disgust when he invited me to sit on the sagging beige futon with questionable stains.

 My head was still throbbing, and the smell made it worse. The melody that’s been playing so freely in my mind began to slow and distort. I could feel my mom's words taking over, “Don't disappoint me again, find a good husband.” A part of me felt like she was still with me, watching…waiting. I put my hand to my head, feeling woozy. “No, no,” I told myself, “Give him a chance, maybe he’s just messy. I mean, who isn’t?” I straightened myself out, putting a smile on my face. I’ve been through worse. I can handle it. 

 We sat awkwardly watching some sort of anime. I notice there’s some pizza on the coffee table, but it was cold, flies were flying around it. I guess he noticed me looking at it because he promptly got up and closed the lid. 

 “Sorry, I forgot I left this out. You're not hungry, right?” He asked, obviously expecting me to say no. I let him know I had already eaten and watched as he got up to put it away. When he came back, he sat closer to me this time. He smelled musty, like he hadn’t showered since this morning, and covered it up with body spray. As we talked, I realized how often his eyes drifted down to my chest and how his sweaty hands kept “accidentally” rubbing on my thighs. I rolled my eyes internally, moving over slightly, trying to not make it obvious. 

 “So what do you like to do?” I asked awkwardly. He grinned and looked me up and down again. “I make body art.” And as he droned on, and I started feeling  like I was being separated  from my body. I felt the cold grip of my mothers stone hands on my arms like she was pushing me away. His words became muffled and slow like pressing down on a vinyl. I felt the twinge of static in the air. “You know, I wouldn't mind us turning your body into a painting.” He says, leaning in to kiss me. I tried to back up, but I couldn’t; there was nowhere for me to go.

 This was wrong. This was all wrong. This wasn’t how tonight was supposed to go. My senses went into overdrive when he kissed me. It was like I was shot out of my body. Like two mouse traps finally being ripped apart. I heard a thousand thoughts echoing through my head, all in her voice. My mom wouldn’t want this for me. More importantly, I don’t want this for me. Then I heard a familiar melody come from the TV. 

 “I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right, I'll love you, baby. Trust in me when I say ” sang my moms voice. Her mouth wasn’t moving. As she kept going I felt her heavy hands dig deeper into my arm pushing me down. I felt cold all over. I felt like a little kid again. 

 I look over to the TV and see the same statue I saw onto of the building. The same one that was in my room. Mother's face. The images flurried in back and forth, its features converging into one. But one thing remained. The one thing I could never get rid of. That disgusting scowl, I felt my body start shaking, not out of fear but anger. A heat rushed over me like that night at the park.

 I couldn’t push Jason off me; he was too heavy, and I couldn’t look away from the TV. It was all too much. I felt like I was being pushed out of my body as I began to feel my mind break. Cracking into little pieces just like that fucking mirror. The volume on the TV seemed to rise as her voice carried through. If Jason noticed it, he didn't mention it as his sloppy wet lips kept attacking mine.

Jason got off me once he noticed my shaking. I felt a hot liquid trickle down my nose and my eyes rolling back. How embarrassing. Now Jason was freaking out. I couldn’t hear him, but I could see him moving around frantically. He ran out of the room and to the kitchen area. 

Everything goes quiet. Pure silence. I felt disconnected, like a passenger in my own body with no space to breathe. Everything in me felt cramped and hot. I knew I wasn’t in control. My brain felt crowded. Thoughts, memories, emotions. That damn song. They had nowhere to go as they became a jumbled mess in my mind.

 I slowly realized I had no control over my limbs as I watched through my own eyes how I began to sit up; I felt numb all over. Following him to the kitchen. I moved silently, like I was floating through the air. I watched as I crept into the kitchen, his back was turned to me as he called 911, he spoke in a panicked tone. I didn't make a sound. I watched on as I picked up his cast iron from the counter, I bearly felt it in my hand as I raised it over and whacked him on the back of the head until he passed out. He fell with a loud thud. When I looked back up, I looked up and saw the statue of my mother. Her mouth, which now hung at an unnatural angle, unmoving as she spoke, “This is for your own good”. 

 For the past hour, it felt like everything that had happened was a vague hallucination. Like I was sleepwalking with my eyes open. But I knew it was all real. “Help!!” Jason screamed from the other room. He sat in his living room tied to a chair. “Hey Kristen, please, come on, let me go, I promise this will stay between us, I won’t tell anyone,” he said pleadingly. I knew I should feel bad, but I didn't. I just felt anger. I didn't even care he’d called me the wrong name; it barely registered. I just watched as my body stared a deep-set scowl on my face. I watched myself stand up and walk over to him. His eyes trailed after my movements. “It seems like our time has come to an end,” I said, but the voice that spoke. It wasn’t mine. It was stern and commanding like…. Like my mothers.

 I felt like a puppet as I was forced to speak, every word painfully yanked out of my mouth. I pulled out my phone, it was connected the the speaker. “You know I can’t seem to get this song out of my head… It's my favorite,” I said, my mom's voice ringing through the air in sharp contrast to my own. The words sounded unnatural coming from my throat. It sounded fake, jarring. I pressed play. Jason's face was pale and nervous. “Please just stop, what did I do?” My body turned to look at him. “You didn't do anything, but you would’ve.” Every word sounded unnatural coming from my lips.

 Everything felt dreamlike and hazy as I watched myself raise the volume on my phone. Every movement felt unnatural, like two bodies trying to occupy the same space. I walked around him, pulling his head back, prying his mouth open, and stuffing a crusty old sock in his mouth. I heard him gag at the taste.

 I stepped away for a moment, making my way back to the kitchen. As a pot boiled on the stove. I don’t even remember her doing this. The smell of cleaning products filled the air. The memory of Saturday morning cleanings came to my head, except the smell was so potent it was making my eyes tear up, I felt my arm being guided to grab the pot. I walked back to the living room pot in hand. The metal made my skin blister as it burned me . I didn't care. I barely felt it anyways. He was crying by this point, tears and snot streamed down his face, he didnt look so handsome now, he watched my every movement. Choked muffled sobs rang in the air, but I could barely make them out through the loud music. He was so helpless.

 I picked up my arm and used it to push a funnel into his mouth, moving the sock to the side of his cheek. Putting a soup ladle into the concoction, I began to pour the boiling hot liquid down his throat. He tried to scream, but it came out more as a gurgle. He had no choice but to swallow as I force-fed him. He squirmed and writhed in the chair as steam began coming out of his mouth, but that wasn’t enough.  She made me keep pouring the boiling hot liquid down his throat. His body shaking now, his knuckles turning white from gripping the chair so hard. With every spoonful, I felt myself start to smile, my hand being pushed back into the pot, boiling him alive from the inside, but I don’t stop. I couldn't stop. Not now. I watched on until he was not able to make another sound, until his face was blue, until I saw the light leave his eyes. 

 A warmth ran out my body, and it's like everything was in focus again; that hazy feeling was gone. All my emotions came crashing down at once. I looked at my hand, and the skin was basically gone; some of it had melted onto the pot and peeled off when I withdrew my hand. I was in control again.

  I looked at Jason, and my heart dropped to my ass. I looked at his dead body. My shaking hand covers my mouth. Reality dawns on me as I realize what happened. The air felt cold, I felt like I'd just been punched in the stomach. I looked around, grabbed my things, and ran out of his apartment. 

 I heard the song trailing after me as I ran down to my apartment, quickly grabbing my first aid kit and wrapping up my hand. Then I grabbed all the important things: money, passport, and extra clothes. I ran out of the building and to my car quickly turning the key and driving off. Red and blue flashing lights drove past me as I left.

 I drove in silence for what felt like hours before I decided to head out of town. As I arrived at the outskirts of town, the radio switched on. That goddamn song again. I turned off the radio, but it switched on again, this time blaring through my speakers. The radio jumped through different stations that played the same song. I. LOVE. YOU. BABY. I heard my mother's voice say through the speakers. It took me by surprise when I looked down at the radio and realized it was never on. I felt my tears fill my eyes. I'm losing it, I’m fucking losing it, I screamed, banging my hands on the steering wheel, pain shooting up my arm. I looked down at it for a moment. When I look back up at the road, I see it. The statue, except this time its at its full size, no longer wearing mother's face bit its own, its features shifting so fast it was hard to recognize what I was looking it. Before I could hit the brakes, I crashed into it. Pieces of debris flew all around me as my mom’s voice echoed through my head, “This is for your own good”.

 When I woke up, I was in Aaron Williams Memorial Hospital surrounded by officers and a few broken bones, and yet even as I sit here in a room full of people, I know I’m still being watched, still being monitored. A nurse said there was a gift left for me, and she pointed to the bedside table. Someone brought me a small angel figurine…. When I look at it, I see my mother, I see he scowl, I see all her disappointments. I know ill make her proud, someday, but for now I’ll just keep an eye out for my doctor. He’s a very handsome man.

I kept forgetting to log small impulse purchases — coffee, snacks, delivery — 
and by the end of the month I had no idea where my money actually went.

The biggest problem for me was the speed of tracking:
• I had to enter the current price manually every time  
• I had to type the name of the expense  
• choose an icon, a category, etc.

Doing all that while standing in a shop queue is impossible, so I kept telling myself:
“I'll add it later at home”… and of course I never did :)

So I built a tiny app called TapBudget.

The idea is simple: you log frequent purchases in one tap using preset categories.
It takes 2 seconds, so I finally stopped forgetting.

I also wanted to understand spending trends without needing precise numbers every time,
so I added optional price ranges for categories. It helped me notice which “small” expenses
were adding up the most.

I made it for myself first, but now it’s on the App Store.

What do you think about the idea? Do you face same problems and need some tool with mentioned features? ",1,1765353573.0,trackexpenses,0,1.0,False
1piwzx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1piwzx8/inconsistent_kettle_temps/,Inconsistent Kettle Temps,"Hello fellow coffee people,

I want to preface this with I understand that what I am asking for is unreasonable and unnecessary. I enjoy this harmless hobby of mine very much so I probably take it too far.

With that out of the way, my question is this: Is there any kettle that is the BEST? (in terms of temp stability)

I have the Fellow Stagg currently and I can’t stand how it drops a few degrees post bloom. I bloom at 95F (50g water) and then when I set it back on the unit, it reads 93-94F. That wouldn’t be a problem if it got back to 95 in a reasonable amount of time, but it takes 1-2 minutes. I have found a few workaround; however, I am no longer interested in doing workarounds. It could just be that the PID (aka pissing in the dark) is poorly set up but the number irritates me regardless. I am aware of the challenges of holding below boiling with low thermal mass but money fixes things!

I was thinking I could get a water dispenser with a heating element. I would just have to get a custom tube of some sort to run from the dispenser to be able to maneuver it to properly make a pour over. 

I have no budget, I am open to literally anything. Thanks",2,1765353545.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1piwyzd,https://i.redd.it/31svyyg52c6g1.jpeg,I heard the last minute of this haunting song in a coffee shop,"It was haunting a little in the way “the hanging tree” is. Shazam didn’t get it before the song ended. I tried to write down the melody by ear, please excuse my rusty third grade music theory. I couldn’t understand the lyrics being sung at all. I caught a repeated bit of tune or a line in the last chorus or outtro of the song. No idea of the real key, just got the melody. The song ended before I could Shazam it or get any words. It was a female singer, light instrumentals, haunting sound. “Indie” was my best guess, it could’ve been anything from a bigger pop singer to a small indie artist. 

The shop was way too busy for me to hunt down whose Spotify might be playing so I just left, and I didn’t know how much it would bug me! 

It sounded pretty modern, but in the style of some of the witchy themed albums that have been out recently. Like Florence’s slower songs on Everybody Scream, but with a sound closer to maybe Paris Paloma’s “Triassic Love Song” or Kiki Rockwell’s “From Persephone”. It had low reverb and no drums that I remember. 

Musipedia gave me an error when I searched, but it’s at least useful for the notation—it was at least an octave lower than this, though (and probably also just in a different key). Timing might be off—I tried to capture it, but I experimented with what I thought I heard. Maybe 100 bpm? I’ve been searching long enough I’m losing the actual memory of what I heard.

1piwy31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1piwy31,Can finally change my flair to EO+H after beating A20H on Watcher,"(First image is the penultimate A19H run and second image is the last A20H run.)

After almost 300 hours of playtime, I've finally beaten A20H on all characters, as well as all the in game achievements. This was a goal I set myself for before StS2 comes out and I'm happy I achieved it -- thank god StS2 was delayed (kidding). Before this I used to almost only play the silent and watch only VODs of her being played, but by now I enjoy all the characters quite a bit (though silent is still my favorite).

The watcher is still my least played character, so despite feeling stuck, I suppose I managed to beat A20H faster on her than on any of the other characters. Though, I've also used the other 3 for various achievements, so it is hard to say. I still think I have the least understanding of her since I know she is supposed to be OP, but I've just started being okay at sometimes making her work.

I will likely keep playing StS from time to time, maybe going back to the silent whom I've not played almost at all in quite a while. I'll likely not play much on A20 any time soon (or maybe ever if StS2 comes out before I decide to try again). A15 or something like that seems a lot more comfortable and still challenging for my current skills.

As for how the last few runs went: Was stuck around A17 to A19 for quite a while, with my last few (A16 to A18) ascension climbs not even being heart kills (though still going for it). Finally, today had a good day and managed to get 2 wins in a row (on A19H and A20H).

The A19H run started with a double elite snipe (though only a handful of card rewords before the boss and a really tough first real elite). Was going for a mantra build, but it ended up being a mix of that the traditional tantrum+rushdown with a fairly silly combination of gold coin into membership card. I also opted to buy ceramic fish, which lead to a decent chunk of healing due to bloody idol. Even the heart went surprizingly well (double pot omniscience doubling wish and foresight helped) with awakened one being the most difficult fight of the end game.

The A20H run started with a coffee dripper and doing fairly well but falling to single digit HP before the boss. However, managed to perfect it (slime boss is quite trivial for the watcher) and it was mostly smooth sailing (including a 999 gold mind bloom) from there until the heart (with a bit of stumbling on time eater using a few potions and losing some HP). I thought there is some potential of going infinite, but I wasn't sure it was doable and the run seemed winnable even without that, so I ended up going for non infinite deck. The heart was a very close fight, however, needing all potions including a fairy in the bottle that shield and spear dropped, without which I would have certainly lost. Not sure if I microed wrong or if draws were bad.",6,1765353346.0,slaythespire,0,1.0,False
1piwxrv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1piwxrv,"Okay Caffeine Baar, I See Why People Hype Your Fermentations","Tried Caffeine Baar’s sample packs and damn, this brand actually knows what it’s doing.
Their coffees are flavourful, sweet, and the notes aren’t some imaginary marketing text, you can actually taste them. Pineapple fermentation, mixed fruit fermentation, frozen cherry, intenso… all stood out clearly for me.

Here are my quick takes on each one:

• Whisky Barrel Aged
Raw, oaky, and gives off that single-malt vibe in both aroma and taste. Kinda wild in a good way. Solid pick, would definitely recommend.

• Honey Sun Dried
Mid. Didn’t get the cherry or orange notes they claimed. Drinkable but not something I’d buy again.

• Pineapple Fermentation
Insane. Proper pineapple aftertaste, sweet, bright, and the aroma is really good,legit after you sip it feels like the coffee is doing brushstrokes on your tongue xD 
I instantly bought the bigger pack after the sample, would definitely recommend.

• Mixed Fruit Fermentation
Super fruity and sweet once it opens up. Took around 2 weeks to truly bloom, but when it did… chef’s kiss. Easily one of the best, it's just like a sweet bomb. I would highly recommend it you like sweet coffee.

• Frozen Cherry
Balanced. Some brews were great, some were just okay — 
Might be because I was still learning my V60 flow then, so maybe I did it dirty. Still good enough to recommend.

• Intenso Fermentation
Not too sweet, a bit woody, and really satisfying. If you like something slightly bitter but rich, and very addictive. My second favourite after Mixed Fruit.

Overall, Caffeine Baar is absolutely worth trying. If you want to start somewhere, go Pineapple and Mixed Fruit — those two are the clear winners for me.

And if you’ve got a specific V60 or French press method that worked well for you, do drop it in the comments :)

first run: December 13 (Saturday), 12:00,  am Hirschchen in Pempelfort  
We can leave our bags there, go for a relaxed run and then come back to enjoy a coffee together.

I felt a little rude about like he saying how he have to move the meetings that he had to attend and everything, and then he had a foreign trip with his friends . Then he ghosted me for a month and then didn’t even reach out back and after a month, he called me back, and I didn’t pick it up the call at that time, but he messaged me, and then said that he’s not in the right space, right mind and many things are going professionally and personally in his life and he’s not gonna move forward moving to this year. 

They reached out again and we thought of meeting it again and we met along with our parents. This time and his father is sick, so he didn’t come, neither his younger brother, only his mother and he came and his mother was nice. I felt like She didn’t have any expectations with me and we had a brief conversation. Family liked each other. 

yesterday I met him again after working hours and we had a coffee so again he talked about himself a lot, and I clarified some things that I wanted to, and my family wanted to, and I feel like he was still not trying to listen to me, and I felt in his eyes that he is observing me or something .I felt like he was just trying to know what I am, and who I am which I am not very mad about the only thing I felt that he was just keep talking about himself, and I felt like he was you know, showing off talking about the big restaurants and talking about taking me to the big hotels for restaurant to try to food to try and talking about the various foreign trips he had to and how he is manager he is in his own company and how he tackles issues if he had any and at the same time.
I don’t know if this is something that I am overthinking about or not, but I just don’t like the fact that he wasn’t trying to listen to me, and when I was talking or trying to convey something, he just kept talking and trying to complete his whole thing rather than just listening to me and I felt like he was checking some checklist on his mind. 
I’m not sure so, and he’s a bit overweight as well. Didn’t look like his picture. And im fit. 5 years age gap between us.

It was only for 5 minutes but here are my thoughts.

1. Beautiful... much nicer than the Huawei, and i trust samsung whereas i dont trust anything chinese.  Feels very premium.  

2. It feels noticeably heavy compared to my fold 6, but what do you expect.  It has a 3rd screen.

3. I love it but biggest concern is one handed use.  My fold 6 I can hold in one hand unfolded and drink a coffee at the same time.  That's gonna be tough with with tri fold.

4. Holding it in vertical orientation is beautiful.   

5. Unfolding it is no big deal but obviously not as quick as with my fold 6.


So I'm trying to rationalize buying it.  My use case is consuming content at coffee shops like most people.  I love the big screen, but i just wish it was a bit lighter for one handed ops.

I have an absolutely insatiable appetite and starting to feel self conscious about it. This is lifelong, I'm known among family and friends for it. I'm wondering if this is a Hashimoto's thing, although it doesn't seem to be. I'm 29F, 5'5"", 128 lbs and eat more than anyone else I know, within one sitting and also in general. I am not a person who can skip meals (it goes very badly for me, whole body starts shutting down and runs out of energy, strength and kindness quickly). I can eat to full capacity (which is rare) and still get hungry after 30 minutes.



The biggest reasons I want to change this are because a) I'm expensive and b) if I eventually begin to gain weight due to this. 



I have no unhealthy habits (alcohol, losing sleep, etc) aside from a slight coffee addiction. I take my TSH sub every morning as instructed, I prioritize whole foods and avoid sugar (I do not use it in my house). I'm generally not a big fan of a lot of gluteny stuff so that's easy, and the dairy I do consume regularly is lactose free. 

I've found that my body is happiest with lots of animal protein, very few carbs/starchy stuff and high intensity workouts a couple times a week, although due to financial fluctuations I'm not usually able to meet all three. 



Nuances: 

I have full blown Hashimoto's and have been told basically throughout my 20s how fast my metabolism is for someone who has it. It's probably slowed down a bit due to age. Mentioning this because calorie deficits or deprivation diets don't work for me, and often have an opposite effect (I swell more and lose energy)

I've also noticed my body naturally develops muscle quickly, so I'm not sure if that could also be related to this. When I can, I have a pretty active lifestyle (bike/walk everywhere, try different fitness classes, work physical jobs), but nothing crazy.



Does anyone who has experienced this have tips for maintaining energy levels at a satisfactory point without needing to ingest a ton every day?  

And not getting hungry so often/as fast? 

I would like to lose some weight, too! 

Again, to reiterate - I really don't think it's a ""hijack your hunger signal"" psychological thing for me, the hunger is intense, and shit goes south fast if I don't eat close to when I start feeling that.

I consistently require **9 hours of sleep as my absolute minimum** to stay healthy. If I go below that, things go downhill fast.

**Crucial Point:** I have confirmed that the **only thing** that consistently triggers these severe illnesses for me is **lack of sleep**. No other factors—like dietary changes, intense exercise, or typical daily stress—cause this immediate, systemic breakdown.

# What Happens When I Get Less Sleep

**Initial Reaction (One Night):** If I get just **7–8 hours of sleep for a single night**, I feel immediate exhaustion and mild sickness. Specific symptoms include:

* My **eyes sting** and it becomes **painful to put in contact lenses.**
* My **gums will start bleeding**, and my **lips get chapped and bleed.**
* I'll have a **mini sore throat.**

**Full System Collapse (Cumulative Debt):** If I get **8 hours of sleep for just three nights in a row** (so, a total of \~3 hours of sleep debt), my body completely collapses and it takes a week to recover.

**Severe Symptoms:** It’s not just feeling tired. I develop:

* **Fever**
* **Severe Sore Throat**
* **Debilitating Nausea and Extreme Fatigue**
* **Intense body aches, especially in my back and neck.**

My doctors have suggested it might be an exaggerated **inflammatory response** to stress or lack of sleep, but it feels way beyond what’s typically described as “just stress.”

# My Concerning Reality & Medical Workup So Far

* **Background:** I’m a **23-year-old female**, normal BMI, eat healthy, and exercise regularly.
   * **Note on Sensitivity:** I have an unusual sensitivity to stimulants; for example, **one cup of coffee in the morning affects me for 18 hours.**
* **Extensive Testing:** I’ve seen **2 immunologists, an ENT, several primary care doctors, a hematologist, and sleep specialists.** I’ve had an extensive workup, including tests for common infections like EBV/mono – all negative or normal. My in-lab sleep study showed “textbook” sleep quality and efficiency.
* **Duration & Worsening:** This has been an ongoing issue for **4.5 years**, and the **sensitivity to lack of sleep gets worse every few months.**
* **Frequency/Severity:** In the **5 months since graduating college, I’ve had 12 intense viral illnesses.** Each one takes **at least a week** of being really sick in bed to recover.
   * **Contagion:** The viruses are **contagious** – others catch them from me – but most people recover in a couple of days, while I’m wiped out for much longer.
   * **Roommate Validation:** My **roommates hear how sick I get and are genuinely concerned.**
* **Recent Example:** I just got over a virus where I had a **103°F fever**, was **constantly coughing up phlegm**, **blowing my nose every 3-5 minutes**, had severe **back and neck pain**, and needed **11–12 hours of sleep per night** just to function.

# My Questions for the Community

1. **High Sleep Need/Severe Symptoms:** Has anyone else found that they need **9 hours of sleep just to stay healthy**, and experience this level of immediate physical breakdown from even minor sleep loss (like the **stinging eyes/bleeding lips**)? If so, what did you do about it?
2. **Underlying Cause:** Given the severity, the **worsening symptoms**, and the **stimulant sensitivity**, did anyone with a similar profile find an underlying medical issue? For example, an **autoimmune issue** or something that didn't show up on bloodwork?
3. **Building Resilience:** Any advice on building more “resilience” so I don’t crash so easily? Right now it feels like even small amounts of sleep debt flip a switch straight into “full-blown illness.”

The fact that a small deviation can trigger what feels like a serious illness makes normal life (work, travel, holidays, social events) extremely hard.

1piwiim,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1piwiim/thailand_itinerary_fixadvice/,Thailand Itinerary fix/advice,"Hi! My boyfriend and I are visiting Thailand in March (2 weeks) What I have planned so far is staying first **5 nights in Bangkok** and then **6 nights in Phuket** and back to Bangkok for 3 more nights to fly back. We have the hotels already booked and payed so no changing that.

So I know what I want to visit but necessarily the best way to fix it together, I've researched the city logistics and we are staying near a BTS/MTR station for easier transportation, HOWEVER, is it better to do the grand palace, emerald Buddha and Wat Arun the evening we arrive , like a river cruise or the next day earlier? and then visit ICOSIAM via boat, of course we also wanna check out the famous Khaosan road and Chinatown as well as maybe some rooftop bar to party a bit and I personally want to reserve a day for Ayutthaya and Muay thai  at Rajadamnern! **what I really want to ask is what to on the first landing afternoon?**           I guess I could take it from there.

As for **Phuket**, we are staying in Patong and we really just want to relax at the beach, I have 2 days booked for excursions to Similian and Phi Phi and maybe go to Phuket old town. I've heard the Big Buddha is unfortunately closed :(

Which beaches you recommend for just going to lay down all day and eat something nice? we don't need fancy, just nice food and atmosphere, we probably try to party a bit and hit the mall, but for us is more about enjoying the water. I come from the Mexican caribe (white sand and electric blue water) and I miss home, so I kind of want that vibe.

I truly have done research and have a vague Idea of everything, but maybe some advice from people who have been there wouldn't hurt as well. Also i case the BTS/MTR dont reach a place we want to go, is it Grab the best option possible? I know that Thailand and especially Bangkok is not a walking city and the weather is hot and humid, where I come from is exactly the same so I know what to expect but we live in Europe, so sometimes we like to walk a lot.

Thanks for any extra recommendation, maybe a strange coffee place or restaurant could be nice ;)",1,1765351677.0,ThailandTourism,1,1.0,False

1piwi4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1piwi4k/vc_backed_marketing/,VC backed marketing?,"Just read a post about payrolling and high cost that triggered a memory I like to share.

2 years ago my SaaS business gained some small traction. I’m bootstrapped so nothing fancy. I found a variant of PMF, so i went out on exploring marketing possibilities. 
Every year in my country there is a “top 100 list” of companies with sub list of service companies. It just came out so i thought lets contact some of them for a price indication.

I eventually got in contact with one company. Did an intake, told about my SaaS, what i wanted to achieve, etc. In hindsight their questions where only focussed on the to-be situation and the big money what was going to be earned.

After 2 weeks I got a call that the proposal was ready, and i was invited to their office. My first response was, “in the office? Cant you just send it by email? And then a teams meeting?” 
No no no we should do this in person.

The week after that i went out and the moment in was getting near to the office i already got the “uh oh” feeling. The navigation led me to a big estate with a beautiful villa in a nice green environment.

I parked, went in, got to the reception and was offered coffee. The receptionist asked me when the others where arriving. “Others?” I responded. “This is it.”

I was brought up to the meeting room and there where 12 people waiting for me. All with a slightly uncomfortable smile on their faces when i stepped in. At this point i was already laughing my ass off on the inside.

I’m going to wrap it up now for you.

The presentation started and they gave me a 35 sheet predentation on how to do marketing, project management, radio ads, etc. The fee:

325K for the first year, excluding ad expenses. 

At this point my smile was clearly shown to the table. And i brought it to them that this is a little steep for me right now. Maybe if we could bring it down to 10k we could talk further.

And them it came:

“But you’re VC backed right? That is why you contacted us?”

I explained them i’m not and asked why they think that? A bad look was trown at a junior sales.

At home i went trough the proposition i got on paper and it is crazy. It was just a VC money grab. They just know that you have money and they just grab a huge chunk of it. 

 Like they charged me 35K project management and setup. That is like 2 month full time work on a commercial fee, to setup a Google Ads account.

It was crazy but i good laugh. Spend my trip home calling friends to share it.

Anyway, the payrolling post with the big expense + VC backed triggered this memory. ",1,1765351634.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

The traditional ""post-and-ghost"" influencer model is dying, and something fundamentally different is taking its place.

Here's what I'm seeing work (and what won't):

**✅ WHAT WILL WORK:**

**1. Community-first, not follower-first** Brands are realizing that an engaged community of 5K beats passive followers of 500K. It's not about reach anymore—it's about creating actual spaces where people connect. Discord servers, private groups, regular AMAs. Think less billboard, more coffee shop.

**2. Long-term partnerships over one-offs** Single sponsored posts are done. The winning formula? 6-12 month partnerships where influencers become genuine brand ambassadors. When audiences see their favorite creator consistently using something over time, trust builds naturally.

**3. Aggressively human content (NOT AI slop)** With AI-generated content flooding feeds, raw, unpolished, REAL content is becoming premium. Audiences can smell AI from a mile away. The creators winning in 2026 are the ones showing up messy, authentic, and human. No scripts, no perfect lighting—just real conversations.

**4. Micro/nano influencers dominating** Enterprise brands are finally catching on. A nano-influencer (1K-10K followers) with 15% engagement crushes a celebrity with 2M followers and 0.5% engagement. Plus they're affordable and actually convert.

**5. Performance-based compensation** Flat fees are shifting to hybrid models: base fee + commission on actual sales/conversions. Creators who drive results get paid more. Everyone else gets filtered out.

**6. Platform diversification** Stop putting all eggs in one basket. Instagram + TikTok is baseline now. But LinkedIn for B2C? Newsletter sponsorships? YouTube Shorts? Multi-platform is the new standard.

**7. Creator-led product development** The smartest brands are bringing influencers into the actual product creation process. Not just ""put your name on it"" but genuine co-creation from concept to launch.

**❌ WHAT WON'T WORK:**

* Vanity metrics (follower counts, impressions without engagement)
* One-dimensional ""post a photo"" campaigns
* Influencers who only show up for the paycheck
* Ignoring ROI and performance tracking
* Generic, obviously sponsored content
* Celebrity influencers with zero niche relevance

**The real shift:** Influencer marketing is becoming less about ""marketing"" and more about building genuine relationships at scale. It's community-building disguised as commerce.

There’s something magical about the first snowfall in Korea.
It doesn’t matter how many winters you’ve seen — that moment the snow touches the ground, everything feels… softer.

I still remember the first time I watched it snow in Seoul.
I was standing outside a convenience store, holding a warm coffee, not thinking about anything important.
Then suddenly, tiny white flakes started falling, slowly at first… then all at once.
The whole city paused.
Even the noise felt quieter.

It’s crazy how snow can change your mood in seconds.
You feel lighter. Younger. A little more hopeful.

Walking through the streets, I could hear the crunch of fresh snow under my shoes.
Couples were taking pictures. Kids were laughing.
And for the first time in a long time, I felt like the world was telling me:
“Slow down. Breathe. You’re okay.”

Snow has this way of making even the busiest city feel peaceful.
Streetlights glow differently.
Your thoughts soften.
Your heart feels warmer — even in the cold.

Winter isn’t just a season.
It’s a feeling.
A reminder that beautiful things often arrive quietly, without warning, and change everything around you.

And honestly?
Nothing feels more healing than snow falling gently over Seoul.

Regular clothes feel either too formal or too casual for outdoor plans. Then I found a mens safari suit that changed how I approach trips. The suit fits comfortably without restricting movement and the fabric is tough enough for rough paths while remaining breathable. Pockets are placed in practical spots for carrying a phone, wallet or small gadgets making every little task easier. I wore it for a walk through a nearby park and it handled sudden changes in weather without any hassle. It also works for weekend hikes and casual city strolls giving flexibility that most clothes cannot match. Earthy tones blend with surroundings so attention stays on experiences rather than appearances. Pairing the suit with simple shoes and a canvas hat completes a look that feels effortless yet intentional. Coffee breaks, errands or short trips no longer feel like chores. The suit turns them into small adventures that feel prepared and controlled. This outfit is a reminder that good design makes life simpler and more enjoyable without drawing too much focus. It fits into a lifestyle where readiness and comfort matter more than trying to impress others. Options like this are easy to find on Alibaba.

​The first is the Chamber of Undoing, and its memory is a cruel, agonizing drug. This room smells of morning coffee, sun-warmed linen, and the absence of all required effort. It was a place where the air itself was a solvent, dissolving the pressure of the world's gravity. I loved it when you stroked my hair—that simple, absent-minded gesture that communicated an uncritical peace I was incapable of generating myself. The mutual service was a covenant: I would spend hours tending to your needs, running the endless errands, and performing the small, necessary acts of devotion, and I promised to always show gratitude for the stability you provided. I loved how you would leave my lunch—a perfect, small ritual of care—packaged with the quiet, effortless practicality of a person who accepts the burden of another’s survival as a natural extension of their own. And in public, you would hold my hand, and then you would give me a smile that was absolute, intense, and total—a look that suggested there was no one alive but us, confirming our false status as an impenetrable, cherished unit. I loved your love. It was a perfect, unearned amnesty from the lifelong sentence of my own inadequacy.

​But this archive is built directly atop the Pit of Contempt, and the floor gives way without warning.

​The stillness would shatter into an immediate, white-hot noise. I hated how you screamed—a precise, cutting sound that was not mere noise, but a sonic weapon designed to find the single structural weakness in my composure and exploit it. I hated the impact, the sudden, brutal clarity when you hit me—the physical validation that my internal, profound failure was now measurable and undeniable. The violence was a cold, precise execution of the judgment I already held against myself.

​And deeper, quieter, I hated the slow, insidious theft: you needed control over me, to steal every moment, every thought, every peace. You would make sure I could not sleep, could not speak my own defense, ensuring my mind was always a contested, exhausted territory. I became a zombie walking around the land of men, confined inside of a cage I could leave at any moment, yet I hated the cage because I was denied rest. This theft confirmed the most crushing internal indictment: that my very existence was a vast, sprawling burden upon your eyes. And worst of all was the immediate, chilling withdrawal—the absolute physical silence that followed the explosion. The worst punishment was that I wanted nothing more than to break the silence, to endure the shame, to stand at your side again smiling.

​I am condemned to inhabit the juncture of these two rooms. The terror is not merely that the cruelty happened, but that it happened in the same hands that offered comfort, the same eyes that offered the illusion of eternal devotion. The two realities are inseparable, and the final, crushing agony is that the memory of the perfect, simple love must forever carry the weight of the screaming, hateful burden, paralyzing my ability to trust any gesture of human kindness again.",1,1765350631.0,u_Equivalent_Hope237,0,1.0,False

When I started sleeping in the same bed with my wife, she did not find the way I sleep charming and had me go to the doctor. That’s when I started going on the CPAP machine.



I always had disconcerting dreams as a kid. It was always a gamble of either eerily peaceful landscapes to horrifying torture scenes. From being in a forested meadow watching a girl galloping through it as a half-deer centaur, to watching a man get slowly chewed and nipped by thousands of rats in a room made of hardened scarred flesh. I was never the one experiencing it, rather I was watching someone else experience it. I never wanted to share my dreams since the last time I did I got a talking to with my school counselor and parents.



When I went on the CPAP machine my dreams changed. I was no longer suddenly appearing in a place rather I was floating in space. Surrounding me were thousands of stars, each the size of a baseball, stretching infinitely. When I first saw it I was in awe. I urged myself forward and swam through the sea of stars. And then I accidentally hit one of them. The star grew until it fully encompassed me. I landed on the ground and ended up in a field of sunflowers, tall enough where the heads reached my shoulders. As I wandered around I found a clearing with a woman laying down on a soft futon. She looked up from the shadow I casted and had a genuine look of confusion.



“Who are you?” She yelled.



This was the first time anyone had ever noticed my presence so I was scared. I ran back and broke through the fields of sunflowers until I ended up back into the ocean of stars. Then the alarm woke me up.



I started exploring the space every time I slept, exploring at least two stars a night. It was the same as the dreams I always dreamt, a 50% chance of it being either a nightmare or a dream. I once saw a man on a treadmill running while having to peel his bloodied feet from the track, as it was constantly melding into it. Stuff like that. I always thought that I was ending up in the dreams and nightmares of others, that they would soon wake up like me.



One night I ended up in a dream of a small girl, around 6. It was a birthday party in the backyard with balloons and a big plastic table with a huge five-tiered chocolate cake and a spread of food all around it. Spaghetti, barbeque sticks, fried chicken, kid’s party stuff. The one thing that creeped me out was that everybody else at the party had no face. The children and the adults all had hair and clothes but their face was completely blank, and they were only standing and staring at the girl. The girl had light brown hair and a heavy splash of freckles, she was stuffing her face with cake and chicken. She had bright green eyes. When she saw me she babbled with excitement and grabbed my hand to join her. I didn’t want to stay but she got a handful of cake, as big as she could, and stuffed it in my hand. I stayed and ate with her. They didn’t taste like anything so she enjoyed it more than me. Then I woke up. At work I saw the picture of the girl on the screen, she had been dead for six months, her body was found in the basement with two others. I stared at her green eyes in the blurry photograph. A picture taken on her birthday, with chocolate cake splattered across her freckled face.



From then on I tried talking to those I visited. Those in peaceful places at least. And I confirmed my theory. They were dead, some for longer than others. One old man in a mushroom cottage didn’t have a last name, calling himself Robin’s son. For a while I accepted this, I stopped trying to find their obituaries. There was nothing I could do, they were stuck in their little realms in either total bliss or total despair. All I could ever do was come in and chat with them. All the people in their calm realms were very friendly and kind. They shared coffee, teas, meals, all things that I couldn’t taste but enjoyed nonetheless. I asked about when they were alive, they wouldn’t remember. They knew their name, but that was about it. I guess I understood why, it’s easier to be happier when you don’t know what you’re missing.



On one of my travels I ended up in a flat foggy place. The floor was purely concrete and the sky was pitch black. Walking through it I found a boy, sleeping on a bed. He had long hair, spread across the pillow but I couldn’t see his face. When I called him he wouldn’t wake up so I left. At work I saw what might be him. He was missing, a 16 year old boy with long hair. I knew I had to help, at least try to find where he was last. I searched the stars. I never tried to visit a place twice but I had to this time. It took two nights, searching through every star as quickly as possible, until I found him again, in the dark foggy realm. I ran up to him and shook him awake. I shouted at him, “Do you remember where you were before you came here?”



He was groggy, he didn’t want to wake up, but I kept on shaking him until he sat up on the bed. I asked his name and where he lived, it was the same as the news coverage, but when I asked where he was before he came there he drew a blank. I stayed with him for as long as possible trying to retrace his steps. He remembered he was going to be a senior, he was bullied, and that he wanted to disappear. He wandered around town, and that was when his memory stopped. I feared for the worst so I asked him where he usually liked to hangout. He said at the bridge at the edge of town, above a river. When I woke up I went to the phone and called, saying he might be at the river. I hung up before they could ask who I was and waited for the news. That night they found him, his body moved down stream and was found in another town. 



I tried helping more, but the most I got was where they were last. It didn’t help with kidnapping cases. At some point I didn’t want to go to sleep. I didn’t want to float around knowing that I was only helping to find their bodies and that I couldn’t help them any further than that. At one point I accidentally fell asleep without the CPAP machine and I ended up in that little girl’s heaven again. She was running around with the faceless kids, playing a game of tag. Soon she found me and asked me to join her. We played around for a while, eating barbeque and fried chicken until I woke up again.

That’s it. You’re basically building a budget after the fact.

You’ll quickly see:

* How much you actually spend on food
* How much goes to rent, car, subscriptions, shopping, etc.
* Where your money is silently leaking out

This step alone is eye-opening. Most people think they know where their money goes… and they’re usually way off.

For example, you might realize: “Wait… I’m really spending $500 a month on Uber Eats and takeout?”

Once you see the number in front of you, it hits different. And that’s when change becomes easy. You’re no longer guessing, you’re making conscious decisions about what’s worth it and what isn’t.

One important tip if this feels overwhelming: keep it simple.

Don’t get stuck making 25 micro-categories like: “Coffee”, “Snacks”, “Fast food”, “Dining out”, etc.

Start with just a few:

* Food
* Rent
* Car/Transport
* Fun Money
* Savings

That alone is enough to reveal some wild trends like: “How is my car costing me this much every single month?”

You can always get more detailed later. The goal at first is awareness, not perfection.

If you’ve never done this before, I genuinely think this is one of the highest-ROI financial habits you can build in one evening. No budgeting app required, just honesty with your own numbers.",10,1765350288.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,0,1.0,False

Long text, sorry and also, English is not my 1. language. Thanks in advance. 

For context: my BPSO discarded me during a meds induced mania. He just vanished and left the city, not even two weeks later he showed up at our apartment without informing me in advance that he will move out. The only way I was warned, was the fact that he booked the car from our shared account. 

When I opened the door, a friend of his I met a few times and who was just visiting us with his girlfriend was with him to help moving. Let's call him Alex. 

From the first moment on, my exBPSO lost his temper and yelled. And he kept yelling for nearly 5 hours. I already knew, I became enemy number 1 beforehand. I was warned but not prepared. 

So he yelled all the accusations: manipulation, poisoning for month, lying about my life and to others, trying to take advantage of him and hurting him, some conspiracy about how we met, me scamming insurance companies, the list goes on. 

My mom was with me. He was mad at her too. Same reasons. He got in her face as she tried to get in between him and me. He did not touch her, but I wasn't sure. I called the police, they came and he calmed down, but just for a bit. Then back to yelling. 

Alex was here, he saw it all. He often made him get back to packing and tried to calm him down and speed things up, so they can leave again. 

The next day, I once talked to Alex on the phone and he said: he never saw my exBPSO like that. They are friends for decades. But I also felt weird about the fact, that he tried to excuse my exBPSO, because everything just got too much for the poor guy and he was so calm for the rest, driving here and back again. 

Then no contact with Alex, because my exBPSO told his side, not to have contact with me. That was at the beginning of November this year. Now, my exBPSO comes down and of course took a 180 on his stance towards me. I tried to reach out to Alex one more time to get an outside idea how my exBPSO is doing, but never got a reply. My exBPSO wants to get married now. I am the best thing that ever happened to him and we are a-ok. He is still swinging back and forth in hypomania, so the usual limbo has started. 

Side note: no one from his side contacted me. He moved to his parents after the discard 600 km away. We have been there once a month for years with his daughter to visit them - they basically discarded me as well. No help, no information, no contact, nothing. The only contact I have to his side is with an aunt,who was also accused by him as she and I are close and she became team bad. No one is talking to her either. So nothing. No one. That broke me again. 

Yesterday I received a text from Alex.  Him and my exBPSO talked on Sunday and Alex is allowed to contact me again. Kindergarden. I said that I was happy to hear from him and explained the situation shortly (my ex wanting to get back together and love bombing me) and ask for an assessment, just as much as Alex is able to tell. 

I said that I just want to get an idea how exBPSO is doing, because he is reaching out a lot and I dont know how to react, as all I know about him is from him. And we all know how inconsistent they are. 

Alex wrote: I think he was really overwhelmed the weekend we moved out, and like you said, he got really worked up about it. He actually seems pretty stable to me. But I think you shouldn't necessarily have your mom around that day. You could just go for a casual coffee.

__________

And that broke me. My exBPSO was worked up? That is the explanation for using every curse word, language has to offer to scream it in my face, yelling for hours, getting close to me and my mom, not being able to calm down, threatening a lot and it got so bad, I called the police to de-escalate the situation. I was so scared the whole time. When I talked, I was calm, shocked really and my mouth was so dry for the whole time. My mom was afraid, he would loose it. 

I am in therapy now. I have active PTSD symptoms and get crisis management for it. My mom is so broken too. She really only ever tried to help. We had normal issues, but none if the accusations are true in the slightest.

The text make me feel so invalidated. I think I am losing g my mind. I got it all on tape and my mom was with me that day, but otherwise I would feel like I am bonkers. I dont know what I was expecting. I thought, if I would have been Alex and would have experienced this, I would not be so understanding. I would tell my friend that he might have a tough time, but that his behavior is not at all ok or appropriate in any way. And that I would understand, if the other person (me) is afraid to meet and afraid of the anger coming back. 

But all I get are excuses. His parents are telling others, we just had some hick up, but will most likely get back together. Nothing more. Alex is trivializing what he witnessed. And I feel so gaslite. 

I replied:

1. Text:

But Alex, honestly, that wasn't just a case of friction escalating. He accused me of completely crazy things and thought, ""I put something in your drinks to poisonyou."" There was nothing normal about that. He just couldn't stop himself.

And what's with my mother? What's his problem with her? Because we have no idea. And he himself just invited my mother to his place for Christmas.

2. Text after calming down a bit:

You know, because of the way everything went down, I'm in therapy for PTSD. Even now, I struggle to get through the days, especially since exBPSO won't leave me alone. Now he wants to get married. And when I get the feeling that what happened here wasn't all that bad and that it was just him being overwhelmed, it deeply unsettles me.

I understand, though, that you want to support and understand exBPSO. It's just that there are clearly huge differences in how we all see and understand what happened that day. We were genuinely scared.

Now I will stop, I'm too upset. Forgive me. Love,
_______________

Now I am so torn. I cried for hours as I felt so discarded again. Like it is all just a big misunderstanding and not that bad. And my exBPSO was just burned out and couldn't help himself. But ja, sure, get a casual coffee with him. And better leave mommy at home, because he does not like that she will stand up for you and keep you as safe as possible. What? Wtf? 

On the other hand, I feel bad for overwhelming someone, who is maybe trying his best, but is just not that involved at all. 

Was I unfair? Do I need to apologize further? I have a good relationship with Alex, just not a very deep one, as he is also living 600 km away from where we were located before the discard. And I know that he likes me too. We always had a good time. 

So give it to me straight. I am too emotional to find out if this by myself. I feel completely weird and surreal. Maybe I am missing the point? AITA for how I replied?",1,1765350230.0,BipolarSOs,2,1.0,False

When I started sleeping in the same bed with my wife, she did not find the way I sleep charming and had me go to the doctor. That’s when I started going on the CPAP machine.



I always had disconcerting dreams as a kid. It was always a gamble of either eerily peaceful landscapes to horrifying torture scenes. From being in a forested meadow watching a girl galloping through it as a half-deer centaur, to watching a man get slowly chewed and nipped by thousands of rats in a room made of hardened scarred flesh. I was never the one experiencing it, rather I was watching someone else experience it. I never wanted to share my dreams since the last time I did I got a talking to with my school counselor and parents.



When I went on the CPAP machine my dreams changed. I was no longer suddenly appearing in a place rather I was floating in space. Surrounding me were thousands of stars, each the size of a baseball, stretching infinitely. When I first saw it I was in awe. I urged myself forward and swam through the sea of stars. And then I accidentally hit one of them. The star grew until it fully encompassed me. I landed on the ground and ended up in a field of sunflowers, tall enough where the heads reached my shoulders. As I wandered around I found a clearing with a woman laying down on a soft futon. She looked up from the shadow I casted and had a genuine look of confusion.



“Who are you?” She yelled.



This was the first time anyone had ever noticed my presence so I was scared. I ran back and broke through the fields of sunflowers until I ended up back into the ocean of stars. Then the alarm woke me up.



I started exploring the space every time I slept, exploring at least two stars a night. It was the same as the dreams I always dreamt, a 50% chance of it being either a nightmare or a dream. I once saw a man on a treadmill running while having to peel his bloodied feet from the track, as it was constantly melding into it. Stuff like that. I always thought that I was ending up in the dreams and nightmares of others, that they would soon wake up like me.



One night I ended up in a dream of a small girl, around 6. It was a birthday party in the backyard with balloons and a big plastic table with a huge five-tiered chocolate cake and a spread of food all around it. Spaghetti, barbeque sticks, fried chicken, kid’s party stuff. The one thing that creeped me out was that everybody else at the party had no face. The children and the adults all had hair and clothes but their face was completely blank, and they were only standing and staring at the girl.

1piw1e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1piw1e2/aita_for_wanting_no_contact_with_my_pregnant/,AITA for wanting no contact with my pregnant sister,"Hey Reddit, i’m using a through away account in hopes this story doesn’t get traced back to me. I love reading Reddit and all the stories here, so when my life got flipped upside down, I knew I had to come here. I (19F), just found out that my sister, Katie (19F), is pregnant by my ex James, (20M).

Some context: The first confusing part might be the ages. We’re not twins or blood-related. My dad has been great friends with my sister, who we’ll call Katie, her mom, and her aunt since high school. We grew up just a few houses apart, and our parents dated twice. From that, we ended up with a shared sister. Our parents’ relationship was really toxic, and we were always caught in the middle. That shared trauma definitely brought us closer. We’ve always been close, had some awful fights, but also so many great times.

During our teen years, we lost contact. Katie chose a life involving hard -yk what, and I chose to stay away from that. My boyfriend at the time didn’t support me being around her, but that’s a whole other story. We had a massive fight back then that’s still on my mind. To keep it short, another girl, Kennedy, was spreading horrible rumors about me and my boyfriend. Another friend, Melissa, was going through a traumatic time with unaliving thoughts after being SA’d. Kennedy was defending the guy who SA’d Melissa, and I hated everything Kennedy said. Katie, who was spending a lot of time with Kennedy then, messaged me with all these rumors and said some really mean things. This happened about five years ago, but it still bothers me sometimes.

Fast forward to a little over a year ago, my boyfriend and I broke up after being together for 4 years. He was my first love. I was with him from ages 13 to 17. Katie really stood by me during that time. Honestly, if it weren’t for her, I might have stayed in a dark place much longer, and I could have seriously hurt myself. Not my proudest moment, but she was there. She made sure I was safe, which meant a lot to me.

Katie and her best friend at the time, Emma, wanted to set me up with James. When James and I first started hanging out, he wasn’t at all my type, but he seemed like a nice guy who would treat me well, so I decided to give it a try. As time went on, I learned a lot, and this might get confusing.

Emma had a fling or friends-with-benefits thing with James. James has a best friend named Caleb, and Emma tried to set Caleb up with my sister, Katie. After they slept together, Emma decided she wanted Caleb and started dating him, and they’re still together today. Meanwhile, James began dating a girl named Brooke. So the current couples are Emma and Caleb, and James and Brooke.

But Emma and James still have this weird chemistry… (?) -they slept together, which led all four of them to get chlamydia. Fun, right? Then I heard from James’s ex-girlfriend’s ex-friend that James has a weird kink for “fat girls,” has a “corn addict,” and “only wants to mbate and never be intimate.” Great.

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt because we’ve all been victims of false rumors before, and I didn’t want to be too judgmental. But honestly, I can’t confirm if any of this is true or not.

So how it ended: James was honestly a really sweet guy, and we’d probably been seeing each other for about 6 months before it ended. To be honest, I was sick of all the drama. Emma would always tell James things like “She doesn’t like you,” “She’s playing you,” “She’s not attracted to you,” and a bunch of other bullshit. Just to be clear, Emma and I aren’t friends, we had a few surface-level conversations only. I truly believe she likes James and doesn’t want him with anyone but her. This caused a lot of fights, and toward the end, it was pretty much daily. I decided that once it happened again, I was going to blow it the fuck up. So I did just that. I should have been a big-girl and ended it normally, but for some reason I didn’t (at some random function, we did talk it out and agreed on being mutual and mature).

This fight actually happened on my birthday. The fight this time was about my sister. Emma, Katie, and some other people wanted to have a little get-together at James’s house, and I wasn’t invited. He told me he didn’t know about it and also didn’t know my sister was coming, which honestly makes me think they just chose his house because they could get away with it there. I think he involuntarily hosted.

So Katie actually slept in James’s bed that night, and I honestly don’t believe anything happened, but maybe that’s just me being naive. I ended up telling Katie’s boyfriend at the time about all this too. I definitely blew the fight up. James claimed “she helped herself into my bed,” but knowing my sister, she’s shy and awkward, I don’t think she would ever do that.

I remember telling him, “It’s so obvious you like Katie, just be with her then,” (which honestly wasn’t how I felt). I also told him, “You never come to me about anything, but instead go to Emma and Katie. I don’t want a four-way relationship, this isn’t what I signed up for” (which were my honest feelings). I also called him out on all those rumors.

Me and my sister would occasionally make fun of his looks because like, how does he pull and have a new girl every week? Then tension started to build in our relationship. Honestly, a lot of these things were small, nothing big enough for me to make a fuss over. We have quite a few siblings, so it’s hard to really bond with all of them at once. I’d have moments where I was close with one sister for a few days, then hang out with the other one for a few days. It kind of alternated who I spent my free time with.

It felt like every time I was bonding with one of my sisters, Katie would come in and, what felt to me, was bribing them away from me. Stuff like, “Hey, do you wanna go get coffee?” or “Do you wanna go shopping with me?” Things little kids are gonna say yes to. And it was always just one child at a time, and it was always a child I was hanging out with.

Another thing I noticed was that I talked about wanting to do multiple things, like trips that required a passport, events, or visiting new places. Katie would hear about these plans, whether I told her directly or she overheard. Then, within a week or less, she’d say stuff like, “Oh, me and Emma are planning a go to that place,” and it’d be the exact place I wanted to go. I never really said anything about it; I’d just give helpful info like, “Did you know there’s one closer to us?” and that was it.

I feel like we need a bit of backstory here, but I’ll keep it short and simple. We have a cousin, Ashley (F19), who’s involved in this. Katie’s first love was really hard on her. After they broke up, that ex-boyfriend started dating Ashley. Katie actually caught him cheating on her with Ashley multiple times. Once Katie and that boy broke up, he and Ashley had a full-on relationship. 

This happened again when Katie broke up with another boyfriend this year. Ashley is currently with one of Katie’s exes for the second time. Katie was really upset about it, and I’ve always been there to support her through it. She’s wanted to do some pretty crazy, irrational things, but I’ve talked her out of it because it’s not worth the battle. 

I felt bad for her because I couldn’t imagine someone doing that to me, so I tried my best to support her through it, and I pretty much still do. Actually, Ashley kind of stopped talking to us and coming around. I think her guilty conscience weighs on her, and she just didn’t want to face the issue. Katie’s mom would definitely say something about it, so Ashley knew to keep her distance. 

So yeah, Katie has definitely been a victim of a family member dating her ex, twice, and I feel like Katie would never do that to someone because she knows exactly how it feels, how much it hurts, and how wrong it is to do that to someone you love and consider family.

So I found out that Katie is seeing James, and I had already made up my mind to do minimum contact with her because of it. The only time I’d talk to her would be about family stuff or the sisters. I wasn’t going to have normal conversations or be friends with her beyond that. I knew it was going to be hard for me to stick around, but at least I planned to keep minimum contact until they break up and James is out of the picture.

I had this game plan, but it’s been really hard. There have been a lot of weird situations where I feel like I’m almost forced to confront it, but I still haven’t. I don’t want to fight because when we do, the whole family gets involved and it gets twisted. Somehow, I always end up being the bad guy, I’m too sensitive, making a fuss, and/or causing fights for no reason. I’m so tired of being in that position and being belittled, so it’s just not worth it. I’ll distance myself and avoid drama or arguments. I don’t want to argue or fight with her, but my feelings are definitely hurt. I feel a deep sense of betrayal, and it really upsets me.

The hard truth is, she never talked to me about it or asked how I feel, and she’s never admitted they’re together. Then Katie told me about another incident with James and Emma. Apparently, one night they were all drinking, and Emma and James slept together again. I remember telling Katie, “It’s so obvious they’re in love with each other, why won’t they just be together?” And she just got silent after that because Katie and James are technically dating now, whether they say it or not.

So today I find out from her and our shared sister that Katie is now pregnant with his (James’s) baby. She didn’t say it was him, but it’s definitely is. She spends almost every night at his house and is around him a lot, and he’s the only guy she’s seeing, (or at least I hope). So I can put two and two together and know she’s pregnant with his baby. She still hasn’t told me directly, but that’s okay. I don’t want to talk to her about it anyway. She’s very much against abortion so the baby will be coming. She said she’d know the gender by the end of the month, so I assume she’s about nine weeks along.

I don’t want anything to do with this. I don’t even want to be an aunt. I don’t want to talk to her or be around her. I don’t want to be around our shared sister either because it’s going to remind me and it feels like it’s being rubbed in my face. That’s just how I feel. And I don’t want to feel any of this. But I want us to be close. I don’t want to fight, I want a good relationship, but with all this, it feels impossible now. I love Katie and don’t want to stop talking to her, but I feel like I’ve reached a point where, for my own peace, I need to distance myself from her for now and see how I feel later in life.

But I really don’t want to. Obviously, there will have to be some kind of interaction unless I want to miss out on holidays, birthdays, and big events -and that’s not going to happen. I’ll have to see her at some point.

Today she brought up this news and said we should hang out. Now, I really don’t know what to do. She wants me to help her with her pregnancy, support her, and give her advice. I feel like I’m being put in a position where I either have to accept this situation or lose my relationship with my sister and I don’t want either of those things. So, would I be the asshole if I decided not to talk to her anymore? Or what do I do?

***Also, If someone could let me know or send me the link if my story makes it into a video that would be great. TYIA.

I know what heaven looks like.,"I had always dealt with sleep apnea ever since I was a child. My father had the same condition, so my parents didn’t care that we were both choking in our sleep. When I started sleeping in the same bed with my wife, she did not find the way I sleep charming and had me go to the doctor. That’s when I started going on the CPAP machine.



I always had disconcerting dreams as a kid. It was always a gamble of either eerily peaceful landscapes to horrifying torture scenes. From being in a forested meadow watching a girl galloping through it as a half-deer centaur, to watching a man get slowly chewed and nipped by thousands of rats in a room made of hardened scarred flesh. I was never the one experiencing it, rather I was watching someone else experience it. I never wanted to share my dreams since the last time I did I got a talking to with my school counselor and parents.



When I went on the CPAP machine my dreams changed. I was no longer suddenly appearing in a place rather I was floating in space. Surrounding me were thousands of stars, each the size of a baseball, stretching infinitely. When I first saw it I was in awe. I urged myself forward and swam through the sea of stars. And then I accidentally hit one of them. The star grew until it fully encompassed me. I landed on the ground and ended up in a field of sunflowers, tall enough where the heads reached my shoulders. As I wandered around I found a clearing with a woman laying down on a soft futon. She looked up from the shadow I casted and had a genuine look of confusion.



“Who are you?” She yelled.



This was the first time anyone had ever noticed my presence so I was scared. I ran back and broke through the fields of sunflowers until I ended up back into the ocean of stars. Then the alarm woke me up.



I started exploring the space every time I slept, exploring at least two stars a night. It was the same as the dreams I always dreamt, a 50% chance of it being either a nightmare or a dream. I once saw a man on a treadmill running while having to peel his bloodied feet from the track, as it was constantly melding into it. Stuff like that. I always thought that I was ending up in the dreams and nightmares of others, that they would soon wake up like me.



One night I ended up in a dream of a small girl, around 6. It was a birthday party in the backyard with balloons and a big plastic table with a huge five-tiered chocolate cake and a spread of food all around it. Spaghetti, barbeque sticks, fried chicken, kid’s party stuff. The one thing that creeped me out was that everybody else at the party had no face. The children and the adults all had hair and clothes but their face was completely blank, and they were only standing and staring at the girl. The girl had light brown hair and a heavy splash of freckles, she was stuffing her face with cake and chicken. She had bright green eyes. When she saw me she babbled with excitement and grabbed my hand to join her. I didn’t want to stay but she got a handful of cake, as big as she could, and stuffed it in my hand. I stayed and ate with her. They didn’t taste like anything so she enjoyed it more than me. Then I woke up. At work I saw the picture of the girl on the screen, she had been dead for six months, her body was found in the basement with two others. I stared at her green eyes in the blurry photograph. A picture taken on her birthday, with chocolate cake splattered across her freckled face.



From then on I tried talking to those I visited. Those in peaceful places at least. And I confirmed my theory. They were dead, some for longer than others. One old man in a mushroom cottage didn’t have a last name, calling himself Robin’s son. For a while I accepted this, I stopped trying to find their obituaries. There was nothing I could do, they were stuck in their little realms in either total bliss or total despair. All I could ever do was come in and chat with them. All the people in their calm realms were very friendly and kind. They shared coffee, teas, meals, all things that I couldn’t taste but enjoyed nonetheless. I asked about when they were alive, they wouldn’t remember. They knew their name, but that was about it. I guess I understood why, it’s easier to be happier when you don’t know what you’re missing.



On one of my travels I ended up in a flat foggy place. The floor was purely concrete and the sky was pitch black. Walking through it I found a boy, sleeping on a bed. He had long hair, spread across the pillow but I couldn’t see his face. When I called him he wouldn’t wake up so I left. At work I saw what might be him. He was missing, a 16 year old boy with long hair. I knew I had to help, at least try to find where he was last. I searched the stars. I never tried to visit a place twice but I had to this time. It took two nights, searching through every star as quickly as possible, until I found him again, in the dark foggy realm. I ran up to him and shook him awake. I shouted at him, “Do you remember where you were before you came here?”



He was groggy, he didn’t want to wake up, but I kept on shaking him until he sat up on the bed. I asked his name and where he lived, it was the same as the news coverage, but when I asked where he was before he came there he drew a blank. I stayed with him for as long as possible trying to retrace his steps. He remembered he was going to be a senior, he was bullied, and that he wanted to disappear. He wandered around town, and that was when his memory stopped. I feared for the worst so I asked him where he usually liked to hangout. He said at the bridge at the edge of town, above a river. When I woke up I went to the phone and called, saying he might be at the river. I hung up before they could ask who I was and waited for the news. That night they found him, his body moved down stream and was found in another town. 



I tried helping more, but the most I got was where they were last. It didn’t help with kidnapping cases. At some point I didn’t want to go to sleep. I didn’t want to float around knowing that I was only helping to find their bodies and that I couldn’t help them any further than that. At one point I accidentally fell asleep without the CPAP machine and I ended up in that little girl’s heaven again. She was running around with the faceless kids, playing a game of tag. Soon she found me and asked me to join her. We played around for a while, eating barbeque and fried chicken until I woke up again.

1pivzui,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pivzui/aitah_for_ignoring_and_ghosting_my_mother/,AITAH For ignoring and ghosting my Mother?,"There's a whole lot that's been happening for nearly 2 years and just need to get it all out of my system and to kinda remind me exactly everything My Mom has done the past couple years and why I'm ghosting her. So this is going to be super long, sorry about that. And my grammer and spacing of stuff is probably bad


Everyone involved is me (19FM) Grandma (78 FM) my mom (51FM) and her boyfriend (19M) yes that's right her boyfriend is 19 and was 18 when they started dating.. though they were friends when he was 17? Though maybe they were dating then? Idk. ANYWAYS. In the summer of 2024 my mother had this... friend who turns into her boyfriend. During the summer and fall i knew somthing was gonna on but I kinda just ignored it because who wants to think their mother is dating someone only a YEAR younger than them. Especially when they are freshly 18 years old. So in the back of my mind I knew somthing was happening but wasn't sure what exactly. He was over daily and my Mom's bedroom door was always closed. For some context before the boyfriend she never ever closed the door. So it was werid and made me a little uncomfortable.


Time skip to January 2025. Now I can say her boyfriend was getting on my fucking nerves. Am I victim blaming? A little, I'll admit it. If you can call him a victim which i guess he kinda is? Idk. But in January my Grandma got super sick and was in the hospital for a month and a half. She was having heart problems and I was seriously super worried we were going to lose her. During her time in the hospital my mother MOVED into her house with her boyfriend. So I would drive me and my mom to see my grandma (her mother) in the hospital. When my grandma was in the hospital my mother took my grandma's credit card and debt card as well as whatever cash she had in her wallet. During my grandma's time in the hospital her ended up spending FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. Ranking up TWO THOUSAND and somthing hundred dollars of credit debt. She did this in THREE MONTHS. She spent the money on smokes, weed, alcohol, (for her alcoholic boyfriend who i will get into my detail later) food, clothes and etc. Now for some context my Mom is on ODSP because of mental health issues and not being able to work because if it. so she doesn't get payed alot. My Grandma would help her out from time to time. Buying food, cigarettes, weed or whatever she needed whenever money got tough. And if my Mom just spent some money on groceries every once in awhile when my Grandmother was in the hospital she wouldn't have mind. My Grandma was in a coma and very confused for a while when she was out of it. She would forget things ask somthing over and over again forget who was alive and who was dead. Stuff like that.


Now, my mom had been lying to my grandma about paying for rent for our old apartment. She hasn't payed in 2-3 years. How we lived there for so long is beyond me. So when my Grandma got back from the hospital me, my mom, grandma, boyfriend and my older brother were all living in the same house. Before the hospital scare my Grandma live alone at her house while me, Mom and my brother lived at the apartment. So my Mom kinda forced us all to live together at my Grandma's home since we were illegally living at the apartment and it had a huge hole in the ceiling.


My Grandma ended up getting a pacemaker in her chest and was okay. But she needed a while to get her bearings straight. After weeks in a hospital, surgery and a bunch of other stuff she had troubles doing things. Obviously. So me and my mom would help her out. Make dinner, help her shower, help her up and down the stairs, bring her to appointments and etc.


Now we are gonna get into the boyfriend. Now from the VERY BEGINNING I hated him. Was it because he was dating my Mom? Yeah at first it was. 100%. but then I got to know him and who he was as a person and I started to hate him for actual real reasons. For examples. He lived with us rent free. He ate ALL OF THE FOOD. Like I mean so fucking much. He ate for like 4 people. And mind you my GRANDMA was paying for him to live here. Secondly he drank SO MUCH. by 10am he was drinking my Grandma's alcohol and would all day. I'll get into his alcoholism in a bit. Thirdly he was a fucking child. Like such a child. And him being 18 REALLY showed. He was always clinging to my mother, calling ALL THE TIME. We couldn't go out to visit my Grandma at the hospital without him calling and spam texting my Mom. Like, there's clingy and then There's CLINGY. And lastly he was a snitch. Like tatting to the teacher snitch, but the teacher is my Mother.


So over the first few month's all these people in this house isn't working. My grandma started getting better so all the care of her fell onto me. I started to do EVERYTHING I'd make dinner every night, take her to places, make her coffee in the morning, clean and so on. My mom a would go out to the bar every night leaving me to take care of her mother alone. I'd also like to mention i was sleeping on the livingroom couch at this time since I didn't have a bed yet. For for 4 months I was on the couch while everyone had their own rooms. So when my Mom and her boyfriend got home at 3-4-5am at night while I'm sleeping i would wake up. They were always so loud and never tried to be quiet. Sometimes staying up the rest of the night talking loudly in the dinning room. For reference the couch is 15ft away from the front door. And 30 feet away from the dinning room. So just another ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" Ontop of the rest.
Now my Mom has ALWAYS had a temper. I would always walk on eggshells around her because I never knew what would set her off. I remeber times where we fought that she would SLAM cabinets, doors pots anything and everything. There has been times where shes thrown things in my direction, shouted until i had a panic attack and then blame me for it and so much more that im remembering as i write. One thing she never done was physically hurt me or anyones else. So in my mind i always made THAT be the line that can't be crossed... which made me put up with years of emotional and verbal and im sure other kinds of abuse.


So. Eventually she ended up having a HUGE fight with her boyfriend and kicked him out. He got super drunk and was slamimg things and acting like a total child because my Mom was watching a movie with me and not spending time with him. So I thought HOLY SHIT. is this finally over? He's gone? But of course he wasn't. Because my Mom is a huge liar. Anyways. They broke up for like 4 days. And got back together. Now me and my Grandma never liked the boyfriend. So we would talk about him behind his back and  would get super annoyed with him. Now did we say mean things about him? Yeah, I'll absolutely admit it. But you need to understand that he was so very unwanted in this house. He ate everything, he complained and whined constantly. He played his guitar and sang daily. He was loud and a terrible singer. So we would say things. Of course. We didn't hide our dislike. Which my Mom would get more and more upset each time. Saying things like ""I love him and he's not going anywhere so get used to him.""


So timeskip again to August, June July. Mom was getting more hostile by the day. And I mean fucking scary hostile. She knew Me and Grandma didn't like her boyfriend and she was fucking angry about it. She ended up becoming aggressive and cruel. Now she has always been selfish, narcissistic, mean, verbally abusive. But this was the worse I have personally seen her. In the past there was times she scared me, like is she going to hurt me, herself or leave and never come back, scared me. But one day she had enough of my Grandma being upset with her boyfriend. My Grandma is someone who you don't talk to when she hasn't had her morning coffee. The boyfriend is a moron and no matter how many times my Grandma has made it clear he still yaps and yaps and whatever. So she told him to shut up or somthing along those lines. So the boyfriend snitched to Mom. He said Grandma hurt his feelings and was super mean towards him. So my Mom lost it. She started screaming, slamming things, going on about how everyone was horrible people and that she was ashamed of her family. She was coddling the boyfriend and yelling at my Grandma who of course yelled back and told her to get out of her house.


My Mother then said how she's was there to take care of my Grandma and how she was treating her terribly despite everything she has done for her. Which mind you I was the actual one taking care of Grandma at that point. My Mom was just using her for the house and food since she was losing the apartment and was homeless technically. And so the entire house was TENSE like I locked myself in my room for days. I would only go downstairs (where my Mom and boyfriend was) to make food and get my grandma things. And it was like this for 2 weeks? My grandma would say somthing snarky under her breath, boyfriend would tattle to Mom and then Mom would lose it. And then the cycle would repeat.


It got to the point where I recorded the screaming because I was scared she would do somthing. I wish I still had the recordings but they were on my old phone which died. But anyways. One day my Mom snapped. Like more so than she already had. On my grandma's BIRTHDAY mind you, she was screaming at my Grandma, calling her an alcoholic and said how she was like her abusive husband (Mom's dad) and that Grandma's Son killer himself because of her. my Grandma of course was screaming back she was telling her to leave the house and to never come back, about how My mom has stolen money from her and that she wasn't welcomed in the house anymore. Eventually things escalated so much that my Mom had hit Grandma. At the time as I did for most fights I was hiding in my room that i finally had. I know it was cowardly but there wasn't much i could have done during the scream matches and i will admit that i was just too scared to do anything.


But after my Mom hit Grandma i knew i had to step in and do somthing. Grandma was telling Mom to get out of the house so i had to force her to leave. Mom was refusing to go downstairs. She was threatening my Grandma and I was fucking terrified. I'm one of those people who will cry when emotions are high. Super happy? Tears. Scared? Tears. And worse of all Angry? Definitely Tears. I hate it because it makes me feel weak in the moment and like I wasn't as angry as I was. I had to physically push my Mom down the stairs step by step. Because she wouldn't budge. She was holding onto the railing and she was trying to like.. I don't know hold power over me by refusing to go downstairs? This was the first time I had to get physically with my Mother. Other than bumping into her shoulder aggressively during Christmas when she fought with my Grandma then and ruined the whole day But anyways. Emotions were high, I was telling her things I can't remember exactly. But I said somthing along the lines how I hate her and wish she wasn't my mother. And that I wish she had an abortion or somthing. And of course she responded along the lines of ""Maybe I should've, go run to your new Mommy"" somthing like that.   2 days later she finally left with the boyfriend to squat at the old apartment. She came back a week later to grab her things and boxes, and she took my fucking TV, but whatever. I was just glad she was gone for good. During her absence she was arrested, to this day I still don't know for what. She's not in jail or prison or anything.


So after ALLL of that. We time skip to September, October, November 2025. She ended up leaving the town we were in and went to the city. During her time away she still asks my Grandma for money.. to which Grandma gives her despite my opinions on the matter because shes her daughter. all that complicated stuff. During her time in the city she spent her times in hotels or motels. Apparently I learned from neighbours my Mom was bought out of the apartment for 15 hundred dollars? 12 hundred? Not sure. I don't understand the legal stuff there. But i know she definitely spent it all super quickly. And she eventually found herself staying at a friend's house. I'm not sure what happened to the boyfriend. But to my knowledge they aren't together anymore because he sent a wellness check on my Mom. (My Mom HATES police and authority figures. Pretty much anyone who is slightly above her) so he broke up with him. Maybe? In November I got a text from my Mom's friend saying she was with her and doesn't agree with my Mom whatsoever for what she did with the boyfriend, to me, the hate she has for my Grandma and other stuff. She said she was having a phyotic break when she arrived. Which makes sense because of the many mental health issues she's diagnosed with and isn't but I'm like 90% she has. But she is trying to help my Mom. Which I greatly appreciate because I know that we can't do anything for her. Nor do I want too anymore.


Since then my Mom has been staying with the friend I have no idea if she's doing better or if she's doing badly. She has been texting me since November 4th to which I haven't responded. It's nothing more than maybe a gew words or a sentence. No apologies nothing more then little check ins like ""Are you okay?"" ""I love you"" ""Hey!!!"" ""Are you alive?"" ""I miss you"" and then recently asking for mine and brother's Christmas wishlist. To which I still never answered. And then today December 10th, she texted me saying to expect amazon packages at our door. To be fair I was warned by my mom's friends son that she wanted Christmas lists and if I don't tell say anything she will still send stuff. But it just makes me really uncomfortable.


So now I'm in this part of my life to where I can either talk to my Mom. Ghost and block her number completely.. attempt to cut her off or just keep carrying on like this. It's like I'm trapped. whenever I think finally she's gone and she's going to leave me she sends a text. It's not much, always just a small text to let me know she's still there. She never calls. Never apologises. Just makes me know she's still here and won't leave despite my month's of ghosting. I know I should cut contact completely, or send a long paragraph saying to stop contacting me.. but she's also my Mom. And despite me hating her I do love her.


I'm 19, doing online school and have no job because I'm still focusing on taking care of my Grandma and just can't find any that will hire me. She knows where I live so it's not like I can completely cut her out because of that.


So, am I the Asshole? I know this was long and I rambled a LOT sorry about that, but I'm kinda stuck and any kind of advice would be helpful.

it’s inspired by silent footage of hiroshima and it pioneered the very art style we see on all of the official artwork for the album. the film itself is also silent and carries many religious themes.

i personally live a life of monochrome. black coffee. white tees. black sweats. nike dunks. i’m a mixed person. i’ve always been fascinated by racial fiction (caucasia and the help are easily my favourite books of all time, caucasia being my personal favourite). i live a life that revolves around a ticking clock, waiting for the time that i’m old enough to live a life where i make my own decisions. clocks themselves being mainly, black and white. i’ve always loved the night sky. the deep black night sky and the shining white stars soothe me. so, to express these themes, i want to pick up the pen myself and write bi-weekly here (with some stuff inspired by lvjy, my fav band oat), and let the cool, black ink hit the white paper.

i don’t plan to ever release this anywhere. this is no promotion. i don’t make music. i don’t make social media content. i want to write for the lovenjoyers of reddit using the inspiration of my heroes, every once and a while, whilst enjoying the discussion the themes of my fav album with my peers.",8,1765349639.0,lvjy,0,1.0,False

The first weird thing happened the morning after I moved in. I woke up to the sound of someone moving in the kitchen. The apartment was empty—just me. I had no visitors. I slowly crept toward the kitchen, heart hammering, but there was no one there. Just a cup I didn’t own on the counter, half full of black coffee. I thought maybe I was sleepwalking.

Then, the reality glitches started.

At first, it was small. The number of stairs in the building’s stairwell would change. A hallway that led to a dead end yesterday now opened into another corridor. The weirdest thing was my reflection. I’d look in the mirror and see subtle differences—my eyes slightly darker, my hair parting differently, my apartment in the reflection having furniture I didn’t own.

It escalated. I’d leave for work, come home, and find entire rooms in my apartment rearranged—or worse, rooms that didn’t exist before. One day there was a library. Yesterday, it had been my closet.

Then I started hearing whispers. Not voices, not distinct words, just low murmurs echoing through the apartment, even when I left the lights off and the doors locked.

I thought I was losing my mind. I started filming the changes with my phone. But here’s the worst part: every recording I watched later looked normal. The rooms were normal. The cup I found in the kitchen never existed. The stairs always had the same number of steps.

I considered leaving. I packed my things one night—but when I went to open the door, I was staring at a blank wall. The door was gone. My building was gone. The city I knew… gone. In its place was a street that shouldn’t exist, made of buildings that seemed to breathe.

That’s when I understood.

This wasn’t sleepwalking. This wasn’t schizophrenia. I was slipping between realities. Alternate versions of the same apartment, the same city, the same me—but all slightly wrong, all just… off. And the more I tried to document it, the more I realized my recordings only captured what my brain expected to see.

Yesterday, I woke up in a version of my apartment I’ve never seen before. My phone had a message from me—me from another reality:

“Do not try to leave. They’ll find you.”

I don’t know who “they” are. I don’t know if I’m still me. All I know is that reality is… flexible. And it’s hunting me.

So if you see a small apartment on a cheap street with a coffee cup on the counter, don’t move in. Don’t try to document it. And whatever you do… don’t look in the mirror.

Because you might not like who’s staring back.

I'm visiting from the US from March 4th through 15th, 2026, mainly to ski the Birkebeinerrennet. My plan is to spend the first week (4th-11th) in Oslo to get some pre-race skiing in and explore the city, then head to Lillehammer (already booked for the 11th-14th). 

I'm torn between staying central in the city for easy access to attractions and transport, or more out by the trails for quicker ski starts. Is there a clear winner based on your experiences? Any pros/cons or best hotel recommendations from this list? I've been eyeing:

* Hotell Bondeheimen (central, affordable)
* Scandic Holmenkollen Park (near Holmenkollen trails)
* Olympiatoppen Sportshotel (near Sognsvann/Nordmarka)
* Clarion Hotel The Hub (central and a sauna)

I plan on skiing half the day on trails around Oslo and exploring the city the other half. Any tips on public transport to/from trailheads would be awesome, especially for someone new to the T-bane system.

Aside from the top attractions, I'm interested in recs for:

* Saunas 
* Knitting stores 
* Cozy coffee shops or bookstores to relax in
* Opera or ballet performances at the Opera House (any must-sees during early March?)
* Nature spots for birds or fish (fjord walks, aquariums, or easy hikes?)
* The Last Dinner Party concert at Sentrum Scene 

Any insight, hidden gems, or general tips for a first-time visitor balancing skiing and city vibes are greatly appreciated. 

Takk!

1pivoaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/my_life_story/comments/1pivoaz/the_quiet_man_6/,The Quiet Man (6),"It really took forty days for my head to heal completely. On the twentieth day, my mom removed the stitches at home with nail scissors. When the thirty-day rest period ended, I went back to school. I reviewed my lessons just like before, and at the same time I tried to learn new things. The teacher wasn’t interfering with me much anymore.

One day, preparations for the 5th-grade farewell party began. A parent meeting was held at school, and the main topic was the party. Everyone would learn Spanish dances, and special costumes would be made. My mother reacted immediately and far too dramatically.
“For God’s sake, don’t teach the children religious things, just teach them to dance,” she said. Then she added, “I won’t send my son to something like this.” She grabbed my hand and took me home.

She muttered about it the entire way back.
When we got home, my mother was still muttering to herself, complaining that they wanted money equal to a month’s rent without even asking whether we could afford it. I stayed quiet. Whatever I wanted, we never had anyway. Even when I wanted a battery-powered car as a kid, she tricked me by saying I was too big for it. I wore my brother’s hand-me-downs and played with his old toys. But in my mother’s eyes, my brother had always been number one.

Even my circumcision ceremony had been humiliating. My brother’s was smooth and perfect, while mine felt like an afterthought. Only three cars showed up for the convoy that was supposed to drive around the city. The horn of the car I was in didn’t even work, and the driver made the horn noise with his mouth. We got lost and somehow ended up at a garbage collection center in Izmir. Nothing done for me ever seemed to matter.

“Mom, I don’t want to go anyway. I don’t even have friends,” I said.
“Don’t go, son. Don’t get excited about these things. Dancing is the devil’s invention,” she answered.
(I would hear that phrase many more times in the future.)

I didn’t respond. I went to my brother’s room and started playing PlayStation. An hour later, my mom came to the door.
“Get up and clean the house. How many hours have you been playing games in there?”
I didn’t say anything. I just got up and did what she told me to do.

When evening came, my father arrived home late. My brother came home right after him. My mother immediately started scolding my father:
“Where were you? Why are you late?”
“My work was delayed,” my father replied.
“What work? Who knows, you were probably chasing after some woman again!” my mother snapped.
“Enough, I’m tired of your talking,” my father said, and went into the bathroom.

My mother didn’t stop complaining. (Sometimes I thought, “If only God had given this woman a mute button, that would be wonderful.”)

My father came out of the bathroom and finally sat down at the table. We began eating. My mother asked again, “Where were you?”
“I stopped by the coffee shop,” my father said. (Sometimes he went there in the evenings to play cards with his friends.)
“You’re lying,” my mother insisted.

When my father said, “Be quiet and let’s eat,” my mother picked up a fork and threw it at him. The fork lightly hit my brother’s head and got stuck in my father’s shoulder. Silence fell over the table. I stared at the fork in my father’s shoulder, while my mother focused on my brother’s head. My father pulled out the fork, got up, got dressed, and left.

My mother didn’t seem to care. She sterilized my brother’s head, bandaged it, kissed him, and apologized. She had done the same thing before when my brother and I fell off our bikes — she always hugged my brother first, without even looking at me.

My brother had a Peugeot bicycle. He would sit me in front of him, and we would ride around. One day, he took me again to ride down a hill very fast. He didn’t notice a car about to pull out onto the road. I saw it and panicked. In the sudden reaction, my slipper got caught between the wheel and the brake pad. My brother pushed me aside, and I fell onto the sidewalk, but he hit the car. In the accident, his nose was broken, and his shoulder was dislocated. My mother rushed him to the hospital and left me with our upstairs neighbor. No one cared about my dislocated ankle — our neighbor put it back in place....

I have some questions which I don't want to ask my recruiter yet:
- Apart from specific events, how is the free food situation for interns? I know some cafes are subsidized for employees, but how much should one budget for food? And does it vary across the three offices in NYC?
- Do interns get access to the fitness facilities in the new 270 Park Avenue building or are they entitled to any other gym or fitness benefits?
- While networking with senior professionals in other teams is it appropriate to ask them for a coffee chat and try to talk about the kind of work they do, etc? I mean how approachable are they?

I am also open to any other suggestions or thoughts on performing well at the internship.

*Where the Thunder’s Dominance Meets the Suns’ Sizzling Misfortune*

---

**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Power Struggle**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder aren’t just the NBA’s version of a well-oiled battle tank—they’re a *15-game winning streak* juggernaut, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 37-point heroics in their last clash with the Phoenix Suns. With a **104.1 defensive rating** (league-best) and a **16.17-point average win margin**, the Thunder are the statistical equivalent of a math teacher who’s *also* a black belt in karate.

The Phoenix Suns, meanwhile, are playing with a depleted roster that’s missing **Devin Booker** (groin), **Jalen Green** (hamstring), and **Isaiah Livers** (hip)—a trio that’s as essential to their offense as Wi-Fi is to your morning coffee. Their **113.4 defensive rating** (12th in the league) is like a sieve compared to Oklahoma City’s fortress, and their recent victory over the Timberwolves? A thrilling underdog story… until you realize they won by **3 points** while Booker sat on the bench texting his physical therapist.

The odds reflect this imbalance. The Thunder are a **1.09 decimal favorite** (implied probability: \~91.7%) across bookmakers, while the Suns sit at a comically generous **7.5-8.0** (12.5%-13.3%). The spread? A steep **-14.5** for Oklahoma City, and the total is set at **225.5 points**.

---

**Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Former Circus Goalie**  
The Suns’ recent win over Minnesota was a rollercoaster: Collin Gillespie hit *two clutch free throws* with 6.3 seconds left, and Mark Williams buried his first career three-pointer. But let’s not kid ourselves—this team is running on fumes. Without Booker, their offense is a car missing three spark plugs, and their defense? Well, they’re 28th in points surrendered off turnovers. It’s like asking a vegan to cook a steak dinner—enthusiastic, but ill-equipped.

The Thunder, on the other hand, are a well-oiled machine. Yes, they’re missing Isaiah Hartenstein and Isaiah Joe, but Sh

Almond milk is very watery, has a bitter taste, and a strange texture. I love the taste of oat milk, but it makes me feel bloated after drinking it. I'm not sure why. If you know, please tell me.

1piveu6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1piveu6,Starbucks Bev Max,"Starbucks has a drinks vending machine in ORD T1 and it's the airport equivalent of a fancy perfume counter, except instead of spritzing you with “Eau de Sadness,” it charges you six bucks for liquid anxiety in a bottle. It’s weirdly beautiful and also a little judgy, like, “You \*could\* have packed your own coffee, but you didn’t, did you?”

Plot twist: that gorgeous Starbucks machine is actually a wrapped Bev Max 5800-4 wearing a branded cardigan and pretending it woke up like this. Underneath the Starbucks cosplay, it’s a serious workhorse.

(There’s also a rarer Starbucks machine designed for glass bottles/energy drinks in outdoor environments, which sounds like the feral cousin of this airport unit -yes, we sell that one too).

IMO, this only works where there are so many people walking by that you could sell $5 tap water and no one'd blink. Think big airports, transit hubs, places where time is fake and pricing is emotional. Even here, the bottler left an entire E shelf empty, basically saying, “We could make more money, but also we like our sanity.”

Price-wise, those 13.7 oz bottles at around $6 are not actually the worst thing you’ll see in an airport. There’s a delicate line between “That’s expensive, but okay” and “No way, I’ll just chew on a coffee bean I found under this chair,” and getting that right is part art and part math.

Instead of putting the fancy glass bottles on top, Pepsi put them on bottom like responsible adults who have met gravity. Since everything in the machine is already “premium,” they chose fewer glass explosions over old planogram rules.

Pepsi opted for a Castles U1B reader, which makes the machine look modern and slightly smug, like it definitely judges your debit card. Good operators obsess over this because people now expect to tap a card, a phone, or possibly their soul to pay.

Machines like this Starbucks Bev Max live in a world where one wrong move turns your shiny investment into an angry, expensive rectangle. We live for matching weirdly specific machines to weirdly intense locations so you don’t have to learn physics and vending the hard, glass-shattering way.",0,1765347731.0,vending,1,0.38,False

When I dail in my espresso on my mignon manuale, I dail it in till ir tastes good. But as soon as waiting a day, the coffee is grinded too fine.

How can this be happening?
For example, I'd dail in:
- 19g in > 42g out in 28 seconds, have the dail at almost its finest
The next day, or later that day:
- 19g in > 42f out in 35 seconds

I always have this issue when done dailing in, and then i'd have to dail back until its not bitter anymore.
And after fixing it up, its fine throughout a longer time period with super small adjustments.

This makes me think its not due to the air or something, but really something I'm either doing wrong? Is there something inbetween adjusting the dail I am forgetting? ",1,1765347686.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

**AIO for telling my coworker to stop talking in a baby voice**



Hi reddit! Longtime lurker first time posting. I (22 F) have an odd coworker (22 F) and like the title says she does talk in a baby voice. When I first came to work at our company she was quiet and never talked to me and I understand I am new why would she want to talk to me but me being the person I am I wanted to try to have a relationship with my coworker because we are going to be desk to desk so I would just start out by complementing her on her clothes and got us to start talking from there. I finally had my foot in the door and now I don’t have to sit in a quiet awkward space with her.

Until one day she started speaking in a baby voice and at first I thought it was a joke but there was no joke that was made. It was just her speaking to me and I just awkwardly laugh and I just went back to what I was doing. I thought it was a one time thing maybe she was making a joke and it just didn’t land for me but I was wrong.

It was not a one time thing almost everyday now she at least speak in that baby voice once and it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable because now she will come over by me and talk to me in the baby voice and just start acting strange such as walking by my desk stopping staring at me and walking away, waiting for me when I go on my lunch and recently I was talking to another coworker and she comes over to grab a cup of coffee she turns to look at us stares and scoots over and says “Can I play?” in the baby voice laughs and walks away. My other coworker was stunned but then we both laugh awkwardly and we tried to go back to our conversation.

So reddit AIO if I tell her to stop talking in a baby voice because it is making me uncomfortable?

*i’ve (19f) actually had this problem in high school. this girl would not stop with the baby voice. at the time i never said anything but if it were me now i would say, “why a baby voice if you don’t mind me asking?” with as much kindness as i can muster.*

**Miserable\_Concern\_81**

*It's very possible she was either a victim of SA as a child or is simply autistic or has a speech impediment. I'm autistic and a victim of childhood sexual abuse, because of that, I find it difficult and uncomfortable to talk 'normally', and even when I do there still that but if 'baby voice'. My advice is, don't judge her, you don't know her circumstances, if you really need to know why she talks like that, ask her kindly.*

Hi reddit. I talked to my coworker. I never thought this would’ve happened but here goes.

I grabbed my coworker aside and said I needed to talk to her. She followed me to the break room and I asked her about why she sometimes spoke in a baby voice whenever she was around me. She looked at me and began to laugh and I was caught way off guard. She was laughing so hard that she started snorting.

She eventually stopped but it felt like she was laughing forever then she walked out of the break room and came back with our other coworker and they were laughing together. At this point you are probably as confused as I am.

Turns out it was a prank because I was new to the company and they were waiting to see how long until I “broke”. I started working here in August. I beyond words and I am embarrassed because this was all just a “prank” but genuinely felt weird about this coworker and come to find out it was a prank because I was new. I smiled awkwardly and laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. All I can say is that I am embarrassed that it took this long for me to realize it was a prank.

*Don’t feel dumb. It was real. And weird.*

**MyCatIsFluffyNotFat**

*Fucking weird. Who talks to anyone to pple in a baby voice at work. How old are they, 7?*

**Popular-Capital-8457**

*This! Pranks are supposed to be funny for everyone involved. What they did was intentionally make OP uncomfortable for MONTHS just to see how long he'd tolerate inappropriate behavior before speaking up. Then they laughed at him for advocating for himself. That's not pranking, that's hazing. Completely unacceptable in any workplace.*

**Prudent\_Anxiety\_3018**

*Shoulda said, ""All this time, I thought something was wrong with you. And I was right!!!!"" ETA: YOU are NOT the one who should be embarrassed.*

**EchoMysterious7770**

*Don't feel dumb, you didn't actually get pranked. You just work with total dicks.*

1pivdm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pivdm9/aio_for_thinking_my_almost_15_year_old_nephew_is/,AIO for thinking my almost 15 year old nephew is ungrateful and my sister is entitled,"Backstory is my nephew was raised without a father, my sister married another man who has two kids of his own a few years back in a destination wedding that not even my nephew was invited to attend. My nephew and sister lived with my mother until that point. I married and moved out when my nephew was two but still did a lot of things for him, taking him on outings to the zoo, movies, library etc and he spent basically every other weekend at my house. My mother and I have been the ones to step in and basically raise my nephew while my sister was working or sleeping over weekends at her now husband’s place. 

Now to the current situation my sister started her own business in 2020 and sets her own schedule and is currently scheduling her outings during school pickup, birthdays etc.. (she recently missed my birthday because she had scheduled a party on my birthday) I was asked to pick my nephew up from school. I parked where she told me to park (I have picked him up many times before but procedures have recently changed). The first thing he does is get in the car and complain about where I parked, I said that’s where your mother told me to park then he says well I wasn’t looking for this car and it’s your fault because you parked behind this truck and I couldn’t see you, ok fine situation resolved he’s in the car now. I’m a pretty easygoing person and so I don’t really say anything. I ask if he would like a drink from the coffee shop by his house he proceeds to say no and tells me he wants to go to the coffee shop 10 minutes away. I say ok, I didn’t really care to take him there. I drive him back home, he gets out of my car, no thank you or anything and leaves his trash in my car. The kicker is I get to his house and his step dad is home! I never even got a text for my sister saying thank you or anything. For context I have an autoimmune disease as well as several chronic illnesses and so it takes a lot for me to get up and ready. Am I over reacting or is this entitled behavior from both of them?
