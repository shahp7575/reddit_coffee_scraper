I think I saw you on Sunday, June 22 around 4:15 PM, possibly boarding at Trinity metro station (not entirely sure though). You were with a friend—she got a seat, but you remained standing near the metro gate. You were wearing a green kurti and light blue jeans, along with sandals.You looked really beautiful—you stood out effortlessly.

I was the guy in a maroon full-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, Nike blue & white shoes, and carrying a laptop bag.

We shared a few moments of eye contact, and I felt like maybe you were also open to a conversation.There was this one funny moment: you had a chance to sit on the seat right beside me, but a senior citizen swooped in and took it —life’s comic timing 😅. 

I deboarded at Garudacharpalya metro station, and I think you got off sometime after that—but I don’t know where.
I’ve been kicking myself ever since for not saying hi or just asking if you’d like to grab a coffee. You seemed genuinely someone I'd have loved to talk to.

If by some miracle you read this and remember that ride too—I'd genuinely love the chance to meet and talk over coffee.",3,1750854143.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

I’m new to fasting, I have only done one 72 hour fast (with water, salt, and small amounts of weak black coffee) a few weeks ago, and was planning another fast this Thursday-Sunday. 

My experience a few weeks ago went pretty well, I felt quite tired the first day but my energy rebounded and I genuinely did not feel cravings for food the whole time (even when my roommate was eating McDonald’s in front of me). However, I fasted on days I was not working and, besides a two hour long hike the second day, did not do more exercise beyond 10,000 steps a day. 

This time I’m planning on working all three days for upwards of 10 hours, most of which will be serving at a restaurant. I would just reschedule the fast, but it looks like I will have this work schedule for at least another two weeks. I’m a bit worried that I will feel some low energy which will negatively impact my work and was wondering if there were any foods that could provide some quick energy and mental clarity if I was in dire straits at work. 

Any advice welcome - thank you!! ",1,1750854045.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

***Utah-based company plans to begin mining gallium this year***

[The push for critical minerals, rare earth elements in the U.S. – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2025/06/24/critical-minerals-utah-politics/)

[The Sheep Creek mining project in southwest Montana operates using more than 300 mining claims and promises to deliver up to two tons of valuable gallium later this year. It is operated by a Salt Lake City-based company called US Critical Minerals. US Critical Minerals](https://preview.redd.it/qnbkv9jxd29f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8802be06f37ae7150d16e985417360d730c3558)

The executive chairman of Salt Lake City-based [US Critical Minerals](https://uscriticalminerals.com/) told a House committee on Tuesday the company is poised to extract gallium this year in its partnership with [Idaho National Laboratory.](https://inl.gov/)

Gallium, explained Harvey Kaye, has 3,800 military applications and is vital for national security and defense.

***“We cannot be dependent on China for the supply of these minerals,” he stressed to members of the House Committee on Small Business.***

He said the company has 339 claims in an area of southern Montana dubbed [Sheep Creek](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/sheep-creek/) on 10 square miles of land.

“This country can no longer have the Chinese knee on our neck,” Kaye said. “Therefore we need to work together as a group.”

Working with INL’s Robert Fox, there has been the development of technology called an electrochemical membrane reactor.

“It is environmentally conscious,” he said. “It has the ability to process rare earth elements in an efficient, environmental manner.”

By year’s end, the goal is to deliver up to two tons of gallium a day, but it has been an arduous process.

“It has basically taken us 15 years to do nothing,” he said, but that is slowly changing.

In contrast, the Chinese have taken a different approach.

“China and their government have been extremely supportive to create world dominance,” he said.

As an example, the only operational rare earth mine in the United States is located in the Mojave Desert in California.

But even the company that owns it — [MP Materials](https://mpmaterials.com/mountain-pass) — is partially owned by China, he said.

“That can’t be good,” he said, adding, “Let us do what we know how to do.”

# The Minnesota problem

Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., said the Obama and Biden administrations left a legacy that helped put the United States at a disadvantage.

“We’ve had an anti-mining political agenda in this nation that is crippling our strategic national security,” he said.

A 224,000-acre mining parcel had its permits stripped — essentially revoked — that had been in place since 1966.

Deposits in Minnesota of iron ore made into steel were among the richest in the world in terms of concentration: 82%.

“That helped us win two world wars,” he emphasized.

China, he said, stopped exporting six of the 17 rare earth elements it controls.

But he said there are some naysayers in Congress who have no desire to mine at all, which goes against the very real need the United States has.

“We can mine in Minnesota, we can mine in Alaska, we can mine in Utah, we can mine in Nevada, we can mine in California, we can mine in Washington and we can mine in Pennsylvania,” he said. “We have to have the political will to do it.”

Stauber has reintroduced legislation to overturn a 20-year mining ban near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that was imposed two years ago under the Biden administration.

Stauber has reintroduced legislation to overturn a 20-year mining ban near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that was imposed two years ago under the Biden administration.

The bill would also return two key federal mineral leases to Twin Metals Minnesota, the company vying to build an underground mine for copper and nickel near Ely, Minnesota, on the shore of Birch Lake, just south of the wilderness.

The Biden administration revoked those leases in 2022.

The committee also heard from Aaron Dowd, chief executive officer of Rare Earth Salts, based in Nebraska.

***“The United States faces an unprecedented threat to our economic sovereignty and national security,” he said.***

***These rare earth elements and critical minerals are key components of multiple products in demand in the nation, including cellphones and batteries for electric vehicles, as well as products used in the health care industry, the manufacture of wind turbines and critical components used by the military, he said.***

“Today, China controls 90% of the global downstream rare earth supply chain,” he said.

Despite this, the United States can unlock the potential to compete if it chooses to, Dowd said.

“The technology is ready and the market need is undeniable,” he said. “It requires a robust framework. ... This is the oil of 100 years ago.”

Ken Mushinski, chief executive officer of [Rare Element Resources](https://www.rareelementresources.com/), is leading this company in a rare earth element demonstration processing plant project in Wyoming.

He said the company has thrown more than $100 million into the effort.

***In a statement on the company’s website, Mushinski stated:***

***“The knowledge gained from the operation of this demonstration plant will be of utmost importance to the progression toward full-scale commercial operations with our unique technology. Understanding the critical need for a secure, domestic rare earth supply chain, the company, with the unanimous backing of its Board of Directors, fully supports this opportunity for potential improvements through this review.”***

# More on the problem abroad

The company successfully obtained an operation license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission at great cost and time, he said.

***But China, he added, has the ability to flood the market and devalue the material — deterring additional investment.***

A critic of the discussion, Rep. Gil Cisneros, D-Calif., said these discussions on critical minerals and rare earth elements have already been heard in multiple other committees.

“This sounds like an infomercial for President (Donald) Trump.”

# JUNE 25th, 2025~ReElement, Pensana forge rare earth pact

[ReElement, Pensana forge rare earth pact - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/06/25/tech-metals/reelement-pensana-forge-rare-earth-pact/2345.html)

https://preview.redd.it/phy5dtyde29f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d564780dfe88a9385645ca7b206669c1e81fdc1a

Through a newly signed agreement, plans are underway to establish one of the largest rare earth oxide supply chains outside China – linking Pensana's high-grade Longonjo mine in Angola with ReElement Technologies' advanced refining capabilities in the United States.

Positioned as a cornerstone of a geopolitically resilient supply chain, the partnership being forged under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the companies aims to provide allied industrial and defense sectors with a stable source of rare earth oxides at a time when global concerns over China's dominance in refining and processing continue to intensify.

""Our partnership and MOU with Pensana represents a major advancement toward building a true mine-to-magnet global rare earth supply chain,"" said ReElement Technologies CEO Mark Jensen. ""Securing mineral independence requires innovation, not imitation - and legacy solvent-based refining methods simply won't be competitive or scalable in the modern market. ReElement's multi-mineral refining platform is uniquely positioned to unlock this opportunity with efficiency, flexibility, and global collaboration. We are excited to begin working with Pensana immediately given their vast reserves and production capabilities in Angola, a region that is aligned with US interests in Africa.""

As part of the MOU, Pensana is expected to supply up to 20,000 metric tons per year of ultra-clean mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) to ReElement over a five-year period in a choice offtake agreement.

While pricing details have yet to be finalized, the scale of the agreement signals serious commercial intent and reflects a shared commitment to building a scalable, long-term partnership – one that includes exploring additional joint ventures to further strengthen and diversify the rare earth value chain.

The two companies also intend to coordinate closely on logistics and infrastructure planning, particularly in optimizing export routes via the Lobito Corridor, a rapidly modernizing rail and port network that connects Angola's interior to global shipping lanes.

Backed by multilateral development efforts, this strategic gateway offers a cost-efficient path for African critical minerals to reach Western markets – positioning the partnership to lower transportation costs, minimize delays, and further distance itself from China-centric rare earth supply chains.

# Advanced U.S. refining capacity

Bringing advanced refining capabilities to the partnership, ReElement operates a U.S.-based platform designed to produce high-purity, magnet- and defense-grade rare earth oxides.

Since the 2023 launch of its commercial facility in Noblesville, Indiana, the company has gained traction through customer validation programs and is now expanding its footprint with a large-scale processing site in Marion.

Favoring a modular, high-throughput system over traditional solvent extraction, ReElement's process produces less waste and offers a more environmentally sustainable solution. Built around a multi-mineral, multi-feedstock approach, the technology can handle everything from recycled materials to mine concentrates like those from Longonjo, and even coal byproducts.

This versatility positions the company to anchor a resilient domestic supply chain that can adapt to shifting demand across the EV, renewable energy, and defense sectors. As Jensen noted, the path to mineral independence lies not in mimicking legacy systems, but in surpassing them with next-generation solutions.

# Scale and sustainability

Among the world's largest and highest-grade deposits of rare earths used in permanent magnets, Pensana's Longonjo project in Angola contains more than 139,000 metric tons of neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, with a projected mine life exceeding 20 years.

Initial production of 20,000 tons of high-quality MREC is slated to commence in the near term, with a second phase planned to double capacity to 40,000 tons per year – enough to account for roughly 5% of global supply.

""We're thrilled to begin our collaboration with ReElement,"" said Pensana CEO Tim George. ""Both of our teams share a clear vision for establishing an efficient, scalable, and enduring supply chain for magnet-grade rare earths - critical to meeting the accelerating global demand.""

The company has also distinguished itself through its focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, developing a comprehensive sustainability blueprint, receiving green bond certification from CICERO, and earning a Gold Medal from EcoVadis, placing it among the top 5% of rated companies globally.

This focus on responsible mining could give Pensana an edge in securing contracts with OEMs and governments looking to reduce their supply chain carbon footprints and ESG risks.

# Broader Implications

Reflecting a global drive to secure critical mineral supply chains, this partnership arrives as nations accelerate efforts to build the hardware underpinning the energy transition – electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and advanced defense systems all rely on rare earths for their permanent magnets.

The collaboration also aligns with U.S. strategic initiatives aimed at deepening ties with resource-rich African countries like Angola, offering a credible alternative to mineral supply networks dominated by China.

As the electrification of transport and energy reshapes the global industrial landscape, rare earth elements have shifted from niche to essential. Ensuring access to these foundational materials through reliable, transparent, and geopolitically aligned supply chains will be central to advancing both climate goals and national security priorities.

Whether U.S.-Africa partnerships can deliver on that potential – while meeting modern standards of efficiency, sustainability, and shared economic growth – now hinges on the outcomes of test cases like this one.

# 🛑 2. Senate Roadblocks & Key Differences

* **Senate simply did not include** the stockpile ($2.5B) or DoD loan fund ($500M) in its version [youtube.com+8bipartisanpolicy.org+8eenews.net+8](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/2025-reconciliation-energy-provisions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* House’s **45X credit kept until 2030**—Senate wants shorter phase-out and stronger FEOC controls [bipartisanpolicy.org+1bipartisanpolicy.org+1](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/2025-reconciliation-debate-senate-energy-provisions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Permitting fee fast-track** provision may not survive Senate markup—it’s not protected under budget reconciliation .
* Senate also removed broad DOE project rescissions present in House version .

# 🚫 3. Impact of DoD Minerals Offtake Failure

* **No guaranteed DoD procurement** for Elk Creek Nb, Sc, Ti, REEs → reduces early offtake security.
* **Increased financing risk**: Without guaranteed purchases, private investors may demand stronger price assurances.
* **Leverage loss**: DoD’s refusal weakens NioCorp’s position in securing loans or entering MoUs.
* **Slow buildout**: Financing and contracts are now contingent on conventional market uptake, not defense pipeline.

# ✅ 4. Critical-Mineral Policies Still Moving Forward

|Measure|Current Status|Effect on NioCorp|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**$10 M Scandium NDAA appropriation**|✅ Secure|Supports Elk Creek’s Sc pilot/alloy test[congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47982?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  |
|**45X Manufacturing Credit**|✅ Still alive, but weaker|Reduces Elm Creek OPEX if CE-eligible minerals qualify|
|**Permitting Reform**|⚠️ Pending|Could shave months/years off Elk Creek’s approval timeline|
|**FEOC Rules**|✅ Included in Senate draft|May delay financing if foreign tech partners are involved|
|**DOE Grant programs**|Likely unaffected|Fund green separation (CO₂, scCO₂) R&D|
|**Critical Minerals Stockpile Authority (unfunded)**|⚠️ Still exists, but no $, needs future appropriation|No immediate benefit unless re-funded|
|**Senate’s S.789 Critical Minerals Security Act**|✅ Introduced, advanced to committee|Could support Elk Creek via foreign divestment assistance, IP/tolling frameworks|

# 🎯 5. Net Takeaways for Niocorp / Elk Creek

1. **Scandium funding ($10 M)** is a green light—critical support for demo-stage alloy/pilot work.
2. **45X credit remains**, but with tighter restrictions & faster sunset—accelerated full-scale ramp needed.
3. **Stockpile & DoD loan program dead in this cycle**—must pivot to private capital or commercial offtake.
4. **Permitting reforms uncertain**—Elk Creek still faces standard timelines unless Senate restores fees fast-track.
5. **DOE and Senate policy tailwinds** support green process R&D and technology transfer frameworks.
6. **FEOC provisions may limit partnerships**—must ensure domestic or non-prohibited-source suppliers.

Going to bed earlier doesn't help, I just wake up even earlier then, sometimes getting even less sleep than usual. It's only getting worse with time. Doesn't help if I cut coffee down, nor if I limit screen time before bed.

I don't get it??? It just started out of nowhere seemingly. I do blame stress at work but it wasn't like this when I first started there and was under much more pressure. Help, what do I do if this new medication doesn't help either? I feel helpless and doctors don't really take me seriously ",1,1750853850.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

Alright, friends! 🤗 Let me ask you something: Who doesn't want to make *a little extra cash* on the side without having to sweat buckets? Picture this – you could dive into this wild world of AI content creation, slap it together, and voila, money in your pocket! Sounds dreamy, right?

Just a few weeks ago, I was chatting with a buddy who was struggling to pay his bills. I mentioned using AI tools to whip up content, and guess what? He took the plunge, and before he knew it, he made his first *$100* just from turning his ideas into words! Now he’s sitting pretty, sipping on that overpriced coffee while working from the couch. ☕✨

Here’s how you can join the fun and snag that first Franklin:

1. **Pick Your Niche**  
   - Find something you’re passionate about—*health, travel, tech, or even your pet's daily struggles!* 🐶 The more you love it, the easier it gets.

2. **Give AI a Hand**  
   - Use tools like OpenAI, ChatGPT, or Jasper. They can help generate ideas and even write drafts. Think of them as your *awesome little writing buddies*. Seriously, they don’t take breaks!

3. **Create Engaging Content**  
   - Whether it's blog posts, social media, or even eBooks, aim for content that *pops*! Use visuals, anecdotes, or humor to make your stuff relatable. 
   - Pro tip: *Can you use GIFs? YES. Funny memes? Absolutely!*

4. **Market Like a Boss**  
   - Share your content across platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Join groups and chat up fellow creators. You’d be amazed at how many people want your stuff!

5. **Monetize and Enjoy**  
   - Explore affiliate links, ad revenue, or even freelancing gigs. Platforms like Medium and Substack can help you turn those *thoughts into cash*.💵

So, what do you guys think? Making money with AI content isn’t just about the green stuff; it’s about unleashing your creativity! **Imagine waking up every day excited to click away and share your thoughts with the world.** 

I don’t know about you, but I’m here for it! 😄✨ Let's keep this conversation rolling. Have you tried turning AI content into cash? What worked, or better yet, what bombed spectacularly? #MoneyTalks #AIContentCreator",1,1750853784.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

They were far too busy being magnificently unruly Highlanders in this forgotten corner of Scotland, where the gloom seemed to have a mind of its own and loomed over everything like a stubborn grey cat.* Nowhere was this more evident than in the curious case of Mr. and Mrs. Hollow-Oak’s residence.

They were a pair of scotch eggs - golden brown and hard-boiled on the outside, but cracked all the same under pressure of mounting bills and raising their dreadful offspring. Mrs. Hollowoak was thrice divorced. *Though, who's counting?* She was regularly to be found gazing cow-eyed at the television, bottom perched on an exercise ball, rubbing salted caramel fingers across its rubbery curves. With her long, crooked nose, she was - oft than not - willing to peck anyone into small pieces of corn if they dared *usher* a word during her programs. Mr. Hollow-Oak worked in care, working the lengthy hours of five in the morning to five at night. Each dawn, as the village Song Thrustles were still contemplating whether to bother with their morning announcements, he would travel privately (or rather, drive his rather temperamental Ford) from the curb to the sterile corridors at Gavin Medical Practice.  

So, it was in this unlikely place that the Hollow-Oaks chose to raise their children. There was Hamish, unemployed and vain at fourteen; Adam, impractical and to no purpose at fifteen, who collected rocks illegally and visited stone circles; Dany, twelve years old and unusually lacking intelligence for the youngest daughter. All were dearly loved, cherished, and raised by the Hollow-Oaks, but they were scrabbling mouths to feed all the same. 

Their eldest son - *well, merely a stepson to Mrs. Hollow-Oak -* was wild from the very start. Even as a babe on the breast, Hamish's birth mother counted herself fortunate to escape without so much as a nip. *Though he's grown more agreeable with age, the folk of Shin still shudder when they recall how that blond devil once terrorized the village children at their play, sending the little ones shrieking straight beneath their mothers' skirts.* Mrs. Hollow-Oak, saw her stepson’s milky skin, along with his whiff of cotton hair (compared to her lovely natural children’s brown French crops) rather repulsive. *Never was a peep mentioned of the other mother, of course, let alone her name, as she parted long ago, and Mrs. Hollow-Oak bellowed at the slightest mention.* As a child, Hamish recalls - very unwisely - inquiring his father where his cotton whig sprung from. It was met with sudden weeping from the hairy knuckled man, before Hamish’s stepmother made him sleep in a garden tent for an entire fortnight.

 ‘Mother must’ve been blonde,’ the boy supposed.

Mr. Hollow-Oak enjoyed the formality of bacon and scotch eggs, a splash of coffee in his favourite mug - a simple breakfast for a man of simple tastes. Sapped and weathered like an old oak tree he’d been named for, he sought much comfort in routine and the straightforward mind of his new wife. They didn’t share the complications of their first marriages. When they argued, it was about their bills, about his pub crawls, or her hen nights, it was honest and familiar. It was exactly how he liked it. Although, on this particular morning, Mr. Hollow-Oak’s eyelids fluttered open to the sight of Mrs. Hollow-Oak crazed enthusiasm - like some deranged kangaroo - was shaking family photos from the shelves and nearly cracking the television set as she lunged her way forward. ‘One, two, to the left!’ rallied the fitness instructor on the screen, who had turned his wife into this morning maniac. *A little early for that,* he thought, *Susan usually exercises when I’m at work.* Although, when checking the time Mr. Hollow-Oak gasped at where the hands pointed to on his alarm clock. *Twelve O’clock in the afternoon?! No, no, no… This can’t be possible!* But it must’ve been. *It can't be!* But it was. 

Mr. Hollow-Oak would wag his thick finger at the other nurses who came in late. Now his neck lay against the cold block, and the guillotine's blade had already begun its descent. He strained to follow his wife’s back and forth, but eventually caught her firmly by the shoulders. 

‘Wit is it Gavin?’ she hissed. 

‘Tell me the hour on your watch,’ he wheezed.

‘Hoor? Don’t ye mean th' time?’ 

‘Th- the time, yes! What is it?’

‘Eleven. On th’ haun,’ she replied. 

*The hour is gone*, Mr. Hollow-Oak realised. It wouldn’t be long until his co-workers would start to ponder why their manager hadn't arrived, and piece together - to Mr. Hollow-Oak’s terrified dismay - that he’d slept in. *Oh, the faint smirks, the classified chuckles. They won’t ever admit to what’s so hilarious as I trudge past in the corridors.* Mr. Hollow-Oak remembered sending a nurse home for being so insufferable enough to wear striped socks: ‘This isn’t a petting zoo,’ he had scorned her, ‘and you, miss, are not a prancing leopard!’ 

No longer could he dine on salted strips of bacon and scotch eggs, or sip coffee from his prized mug; in one brutal stroke, Mr. Hollow-Oak’s morning was ruined. 

But this was only the beginning of something far more unusual… *This alarm clock seems different,* he observed with growing unease. Its vile yellowish-green colouring remained the same, along with its constant *tick-tick-tick*, but somehow something had altered - something unnatural that made him inspect it closer... O*h bloody biscuits,* Mr. Hollow-Oak felt his skin crawl, *it’s ticking backwards!*

‘Susan, which way does a clock usually turn?’ he asked, slightly ashamed. 

She gave him a foul look; squinting at him as if he’d lost his wits.

 ‘Clockwise, ah suppose,’ Mrs. Hollow-Oak said with a grimace. 

‘No- I mean, does *this* clock appear funny to you?’

She stared at it for a moment. ‘...I don’t think sae.’

‘Well, its hands are going backwards’ he wheezed, taking the clock in a hairy knuckle and throwing it against the television set. ‘What halfwit would ever want this dreadful device unless they wanted to be late for work every morning and late for everything else?’ *This must’ve been some foul trick… An awful little trick by that awful little boy - Adam!* 

Rushing down the stairs, Mr. Hollow-Oak searched hurriedly to seize an opportunity to scorn his second son - troublesome and dark haired like his mother - before it was too late. The kitchen had always been where he’d caught sight of the boy before, so it was the first place Mr. Hollow-Oak went. The air stunk heavily of sourdough, and flour dusted the countertops in whiffs. *Empty.* His footsteps clattered back up the staircase, each creak of the old wood warning of his approach. At the bedroom door, Mr. Hollow-Oak halted. Music was playing within. 

 ‘Unbolt it, boy,’ he commanded, his voice bellowing through the two inches of drywall separating fatherly wrath. There was no response. *Nothing? So be it,* was Mr. Hollow-Oak's final thought before attempting to wrench his son's bedroom door clean off its hinges—or at least trying to. (*In the early decades of his life, the folk of Shin had regularly called upon Mr. Hollow-Oak for evicting delinquents and settling scores, but two wives and the domestication of home life had softened the flesh on his bones. Love feeds the soul, and with nourishment comes laziness, or so it's said.)* For this reason, Mrs. Hollow-Oak found him still pulling and wheezing to no avail, and calmly explained that she had already sent both boys to school that morning and how their son’s bedroom door had jammed. *What she didn't mention - though it was plain on her face - was that despite all her maternal affection and devotion, she withheld not the slightest conviction that their son could so much as remove batteries from a remote control, let alone rewire an ancient clock.*

‘He’s hud nothin’ tae dae wi’ it,’ she firmly told him.  

‘That might be. But then where’d that *thing* come from?’ asked Mr. Hollow-Oak, waging a thick knuckle towards the broken pieces of clock scattered against the floor. *However, neither dared - or perhaps far too engrossed in their bickering - to take any notice of the earthworms crawling out of its fragmented shell into their carpet floor; how the clock’s internal workings were seemingly long rusted but somehow golden and shining, with earthly vines wrapped around its cogs. And against all logic, the broken pieces of the clock continued to tick, its hands wheeling through layers of soil as if it was once buried for centuries before.* 

‘It was bought in a charity shop. Oan Mainstreet, ah think.’ 

‘A *charity* shop?’ he said the word like a curse, ‘It's only-’

‘Ah ken, ah ken. Tis only crooks and suds that shop there,’ she broke in. They both viewed such markets as places for cloth and rags taken off the homeless to get passed around from one broke person to another. *Flea infested, foul smelling, and unwashed,* was the Hollow-Oak’s motto for those sorts of places and the people who went there. ‘Twas a gift from ma mother. She doesn’t ken any better where tae shop aroond here. Of course, she’s a bit daft.’

Mr. Hollow-Oak glanced at his watch once more, noticing in frustration that the ticking of its hands were still heading in the right direction than the alarm. Fuzzy slippers still clung onto his hairy knuckled toes, while his nightgown hung loosely across his shoulders. *This morning isn’t getting any younger,* he told himself groggily. ‘That’s me off now, mag-pie,’ said Mr. Hollow-Oak, giving his wife a smooch. The landline had been ringing from the office for the better part of an hour now; with his keys likely snuck somewhere in a coat pocket or hidden beneath a sofa cushion. Leaving was long overdue. 

Although, he had barely reached for his slippers when a wail erupted from downstairs. Most likely the noise came from their daughter’s folly. It was rather childish sounding - the sort that is typically associated with childish matters - and under normal circumstances, Mr. Hollow-Oak would have gladly dismissed it entirely, carrying on with his more official business. Unfortunately, his wife had heard it too. *And now she was eyeing him more impatiently, with eyes that spoke only of divorce.*

في مشهد تتزايد فيه خيارات الشراء وتتسابق فيه المتاجر على جذب العملاء، يبقى التميّز الحقيقي حكرًا على من يفهم الشغف قبل أن يبيع المنتج. من هنا برز اسم سبيشلتي هاب، ليس كمتجر إلكتروني فحسب، بل كمنصة متخصصة صُمّمت لتخاطب فئة مختلفة من الناس: أولئك الذين يرون في القهوة أكثر من مجرد مشروب، بل أسلوب حياة وتجربة فريدة تستحق الاهتمام بكل تفصيلة فيها.

لم يُنشأ سبيشلتي هاب ليلبي السوق العام، بل ليخاطب ذوق النخبة من محبي القهوة المختصة، أولئك الذين يميزون بين آلة قهوة تقليدية وأخرى احترافية، ويُدركون قيمة الأدوات الدقيقة في استخلاص النكهات، ويبحثون عن فلاتر قهوة بعينها لأنها تُحدث فارقًا في كل كوب. إنه متجر لا يبيع القهوة فقط، بل يحتفي بها، ويمنحها المنصة التي تستحق.

# منصة بدأت بالشغف... وتوسعت بالثقة

قصة سبيشلتي هاب لم تبدأ كمشروع تجاري فحسب، بل انطلقت من شغف مؤسسيه بالقهوة المختصة، وحرصهم على توفير أدوات ومنتجات تعكس المعايير العالمية في عالم تحضير القهوة. ومنذ اللحظة الأولى، كان واضحًا أن هذه المنصة تسير في اتجاه مختلف؛ فهي لا تعرض المنتجات فقط، بل تنتقيها بعناية، وتجمع بين العلامات التجارية العالمية والتفاصيل التي تُرضي المحترفين قبل المبتدئين.

اعتمدت المنصة منذ انطلاقتها على مبدأ التخصص، فبدلًا من تنويع المنتجات بشكل عشوائي، اختارت أن تكون مرجعًا في مجال محدد: كل ما يتعلق بالقهوة المختصة. هذا التركيز مكّنها من بناء قاعدة عملاء وفية، تبحث عنها بالاسم وتثق بجودة ما تقدمه. ولم يكن هذا ممكنًا لولا الفهم العميق لحاجة السوق السعودي والعربي إلى متجر يجمع بين الجودة والاعتمادية، ويُوفر أدوات يصعب الحصول عليها في المتاجر العامة.

# منتجات لا تُشبه غيرها: دقة في الاختيار واحترافية في التفاصيل

حين تزور موقع سبيشلتي هاب، لن تواجه تشكيلة عشوائية من المنتجات، بل ستجد أقسامًا مصممة لتلبية مراحل التحضير كافة. سواء كنت تبحث عن [آلة قهوة](https://www.shub.coffee/collections/coffee-makers) منزلية عالية الجودة، أو مطحنة دقيقة، أو فلاتر قهوة مطابقة للمعايير العالمية، فكل منتج هنا تم اختياره بناءً على مراجعات وتجارب من محترفين، وليس فقط بناء على الشعبية أو الطلب.

تهتم المنصة بتقديم [أدوات قهوة](https://www.shub.coffee/) من علامات موثوقة، مثل Hario، Kalita، وComandante، وتُركّز على ما يناسب البيئة المحلية دون التضحية بالدقة أو الأداء. ولأن القهوة المختصة تعتمد على التفاصيل، فإن سبيشلتي هاب يمنحك كل ما تحتاجه لتصل إلى أفضل نتيجة ممكنة—من القمع الزاوي الدقيق إلى الفلتر الورقي المثالي، ومن ميزان الحرارة إلى آلة قهوة تُحاكي أداء المقاهي العالمية.

المثير أن هذه المنتجات لا تُعرض بطريقة تقليدية، بل تُقدّم ضمن تجربة تسوّق راقية تشرح الاستخدام، وتوضح الخصائص، وتُوجّه المشتري لاختيار ما يناسب احتياجه. فالموقع لا يكتفي بعرض المنتج، بل يصنع حوارًا معه.

# الجودة أولًا... لا مساومة على الأداء

لا مجال للمجاملات في عالم القهوة المختصة؛ فالفروق الدقيقة بين منتج وآخر تصنع فارقًا كبيرًا في الطعم والنكهة. ولهذا يلتزم سبيشلتي هاب بمعيار صارم في اختيار كل منتج يُعرض على منصته. كل آلة قهوة تُختبر من حيث ثبات الأداء، والقدرة على التحكم في الاستخلاص، والملاءمة للاستخدام اليومي. كل أداة قهوة تُراجَع بناءً على تجربة التحضير وسهولة الاستخدام، وكل [فلاتر قهوة](https://www.shub.coffee/collections/filters) تمر بمعايير التصفية والكثافة ومدى تأثيرها على النكهة.

هذا النهج الدقيق ليس ترفًا، بل ضرورة في سوق يتعامل مع شريحة واعية ومُدققة. فعميل سبيشلتي هاب لا يبحث عن الأرخص، بل عن الأدق والأكثر تطابقًا مع تجربته الخاصة. وهنا يكمن التحدي الحقيقي الذي نجح الموقع في مواجهته: تقديم تجربة لا تخذل التوقعات، بل تتفوق عليها.

# للذين يعرفون القهوة… وليس للباحثين عن التقليد

سبيشلتي هاب لا يروّج نفسه كموقع للجميع، بل يفتخر بأنه متجر لمن يعرف القهوة بحق. فالفئة المستهدفة ليست الباحثة عن ماكينة إسبرسو رخيصة، بل من يبحث عن آلة قهوة تمنحه نتائج احترافية. ليست من تكتفي بأي أداة تخمير، بل من تُدرك أهمية أداة القهوة في إبراز الفروق بين محصول وآخر. ليست من تستخدم فلاتر قهوة بلا مبالاة، بل من يُدرك كيف يؤثر نوع الفلتر على نسيج الكوب النهائي.

بهذا المنطق، أصبحت سبيشلتي هاب علامة لها وزن في الوسط المهتم بالقهوة المختصة. يتحدث عنها الخبراء، ويوصي بها محترفو التحضير المنزلي، وتستشهد بها حسابات القهوة على منصات التواصل. ولم يكن هذا الحضور العميق ناتجًا عن إعلانات مدفوعة، بل عن تجربة استخدام حقيقية تركت أثرًا لدى كل من خاضها.

# نحو مستقبل أوسع... وتحوّل رقمي رائد في سوق القهوة

في ظل النمو السريع لثقافة القهوة المختصة في السعودية والمنطقة، تقف سبيشلتي هاب في موقع مميز يمكّنها من أن تكون ركيزة رئيسية في هذا المشهد. فالتوسع لا يأتي فقط بإضافة منتجات جديدة، بل بتعزيز تجربة الشراء، وتقديم محتوى معرفي، وتطوير خدمات ما بعد البيع، وبناء مجتمع فعّال من المهتمين والمهنيين.

تخطط المنصة لتوسيع نطاق خدماتها ليشمل ورش العمل، والمراجعات المتخصصة، وتجارب تذوق تفاعلية، وغيرها من العناصر التي تُحوّل تجربة التسوّق إلى مساحة تعليمية وتفاعلية. وفي عالم يرتبط فيه الأداء الرقمي بالجودة الفعلية، تُدرك سبيشلتي هاب أن مستقبلها لا يتوقف عند عرض المنتجات، بل يمتد إلى بناء علاقة مستدامة مع كل محب للقهوة الجيدة.

في النهاية، يمكن القول إن **سبيشلتي هاب** ليست مجرد متجر قهوة، بل هوية متكاملة تجمع بين الذوق الرفيع، والدقة التقنية، والفهم الحقيقي لما يبحث عنه عشاق القهوة المختصة. إنها مساحة لكل من يعرف أن القهوة ليست مجرد مشروب صباحي، بل طقس من طقوس المتعة اليومية يستحق أن يُعاش بكل حب وتفانٍ. وفي كل مرة تدخل فيها إلى سبيشلتي هاب، فأنت لا تشتري منتجًا، بل تبدأ رحلة جديدة مع القهوة.

And wow I’ve been drinking piss this entire time and no one told me. 



Whole beans are just so much better. Yeah, sure you have to grind them first and all that, but honestly a grinder’s like 25 bucks on Amazon (didn’t pitch for an expensive m=one, since even the coffeemaker’s cheapish). Gamechanger. 



The thing is I’ve tried a couple of random small bags (you guessed it, they’re from costco) and I’m already noticing the difference. But now I wanna get serious about this stuff. Did a little Reddit deep dive before this and came up with [Caffe Borbone](https://lifestylesecretreview.com/dp-B0CCVRNF2J). Here to provide a little context and ask for more reccs. 

Reasons I wanna try Caffe Borbone: 



1. It has some floral notes (Arabica beans) and I’m so curious cos I’ve tried fruity and they’ve been a little bit citrusy so wanna taste the difference. From what I’ve tried in coffee shops, I think floral notes might be more to my taste. 
2. Medium Roast. This I know for sure that I’m only into medium roast coffee, light roast espressos taste like water to me and dark ones are like tar. 
3. Italian. Leaning towards Italian coffees, they seem to have good reviews online and on r/coffee especially for beginners. 
4. Cheap. I know its another mass produced bag, but that makes it cheaper and that’s unfortunately something I have to keep in mind for now. And for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal, considering its not from a big chain that’s selling me idek what in the name of coffee. Been hearing good things about Illy and Lavazza too btw. 



Reasons I haven’t tried Caffe Borbone yet: 

1. I’m fully broke. I wanna invest in a good 2 pound bag to last me a while and it’s not feasible to go around trying $50 bags to see whether I like it or not, so I’m here to gain some more reccs before I settle on one. 



And PLEASE no one recc anything from local roasters, trust me there are none in my area, I’m in the backend of nowhere so Amazon is really the only option and keep the reccs affordable please.

**That’s right! For a while now, the devs have said that multiplayer would be unlikely, but in secret, they’ve spent the last couple of months after release making it possible!** (You have no idea how hard it’s been to keep this from you all!) ((Some of you would also say we’ve done a terrible job keeping it secret.))

# You can now play through the entire game with other Zoes! It's cooperative in that you work together to progress, but we also keep track of player times in levels, which allows for some friendly and pleasant competition.

https://reddit.com/link/1lk3j7i/video/7e04jkwr929f1/player

You can join friends through Steam's invite system or by using specific join links if you set your room privacy to public. There's no separate mode or anything, you just jump smoothly straight into their game at any point, with every shard and every part of the game playable together! Multiplayer has been designed for up to 4 players. No one will stop you from playing with a whole swarm, but you might need a fast computer and fast internet!

The team has also added skins for Zoe, so it will now be possible to change her outfit and her hat! Skins can be bought with Antisparks from the Fashionable Weeboh, and can be shown off in multiplayer. (I’m thinking of asking for a makeover myself!) There are also special skins that can be unlocked by doing special actions, such as completing the story mode or the first level of Disaster Mode.

# Other changes: 

**Some obstacles have had their art updated, making the Agency more intimidating (and visually and technically consistent).**

**We've added a chunk of new character interactions, revealing more of their backgrounds and keeping rest stops and coffee breaks fresher for longer! This means you can get to know me and the crew even better!**

# Fixes:

* Added Disaster Mode localisation for Swedish.
* Once again increased the chance of getting Coffee Interactions in the research outpost. Hopefully it sticks this time!
* Hitting the pillars of one of the big Agency Platform obstacles no longer turns the main platform into an intangible death trap.
* Flat Item stat bonuses no longer scale with your metaprogression level for that stat.

* Added a missing homage to Flopsy the Lovable Clown

Any substance that gives you a lift follows the same journey as the bird in the video. You start out at a healthy balance. But before you know it. You are trapped in an addictive cycle.

> DISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!

Or.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.

Here’s how it goes:

1. You take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository… Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)

2. You think, “Caffeine is great”. Look at all your new “energy, adrenaline rush, tomato!”.

3. You wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can’t get out of bed. Let’s get some of that caffeine to make you feel better.


And the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality.

Your joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you.

Take a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz’s famous book “Breakthrough Advertising”:

> WHY MEN CRACK.. .

> An authority of international standing recently wrote;

> “You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . “

> You know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men — men who have never had a sick day in their lives.

> They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.

> You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.

> “He was such a healthy-looking man “

People knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted.

## Caffeine is the #1 ignored factor when it comes to health.

Here is the “advice” we see over and over again in regards to taking control of your physical health:

- Cut carbs. 
- Cut out blue light.
- Don’t eat past 6.
- Don’t eat uncooked spinach.
- Eat only meat.
- Stop eating unsoaked almonds.
- Take this supplement.

80% of Americans consume some form of caffeine daily. I’ve seen mothers give their toddlers Mountain dew! Almonds are the problem? What world are we living in?

We are so obsessed with minor details that we miss the obvious. Seriously, anyone who is recommending putting butter in your coffee for optimal health has no clue what optimal health is.

People are clueless about caffeine. Why?

Because it’s “Normal”.

It’s a problem that is hard to see before it’s too late.

“But caffeine is not a problem for me.”

Any amount of stimulants in your body is a problem. It’s effecting you **today.** If you want to feel breadth of emotions again, have unlimited energy throughout the day, have healthy joints, be able to recover fully from exercise, have the most creative thoughts you can possibly have…

You need to quit caffeine. Plain and simple. You are not living the life you are fully capable of.

## Studies showing caffeine is “Healthy”.

Really think about it. Would you believe studies about cocaine funded by cocaine dealers or done my cocaine addicts that think cocaine gives them a positive lift?

There is a billion dollar industry that thrives off of you believing this nonsense. And the mildness of the drug and normalization make many people never second guess it.

The science is not as bleeding edge as we think. Especially when it comes to nutrition. Caffeine is not a vitamin. We need to start relying a little bit more on human intuition then studies funded by big caffeine and drug addicts.

## Is caffeine stopping us from living the lives we truly want?

Here’s the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:

> It’s Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks

> I’m a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn’t returned to pre-caffeine levels since.

> I have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a “stop and smell the roses” mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don’t get _jack shit_ done at work.

> I can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It’s not withdrawal. You’re a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there’s no hiding.

There is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi’s gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right?

Caffeine is a worker bee drug. It makes you a slave and complacent. It numbs your prefrontal cortex just like any other drug.

This screws with your ability to delay gratification and makes you seek out more short term rewards to numb the pain.

I go over the pain-pleasure balance in my [Dopamine Nation](../../booknotes/Dopamine%20Nation.md) summary. So I won’t re-hash it here.

But the pain-pleasure balance is important to understand. Once you do. You will realize that putting anything in your body that is not food or water is making you miserable.

## Caffeine is a gateway drug.

Imagine this..

You are anxious, on edge, irritable, depressed, have trouble sleeping. You think this is just you. You reach for alcohol or weed or Kratom or whatever to take the edge off. You were only in that state because of caffeine.

This scenario may not have happened to you yet. But I guarantee it has happened to millions of people who have turned towards drugs to numb the pain.

Caffeine kills people, tips people with deadly heart disease over the edge, plays a factor in road rage car accidents, causes vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cardiac arrhythmia, perpetuates drug addiction, and much more.

It’s poison.

She lives in the same student dorm. In the beginning, we met regularly at house parties. Then our friend groups merged, and we began hanging out more often. About two years ago, we started doing things just the two of us—going out when nobody else wanted to, grabbing a coffee because no one else had time. She became one of my best friends.

We started watching a TV show together. We cuddled a lot, and we even shared a bed on a holiday we did as a group. (I should mention that she often said she’d love to have a cuddle buddy who doesn’t want sex, but all the guys are too creepy to ask to just cuddle.) But it was never sexual in any way.

During that time, she was even in a relationship for about six months, but that ended six months ago.  
Three weeks ago, she told me she has feelings for me. I told her that, for me, it’s only platonic. She said she needs some time to process everything. We haven’t seen each other alone since. And when we meet in our friend group, it’s weird between us.

  
I’m really sorry about this situation. I’m also sorry that I can’t give her what she wants. I see how hurt she is, and I get that she needs time—and maybe we’ll never be close friends again. But it’s not just her who lost something. I lost a best friend too.

She was one of the few people I could always talk to. We helped each other through so many things, and now we have no contact at all.

Elara Vance stepped out of the car, her heart racing with anticipation. After three weeks apart from her family, she had flown to Andoria on her birthday, hoping to surprise Damien and Cora. The sprawling Thorne estate loomed before her, its grand façade a stark reminder of the wealth and power of the family she had married into.



""Welcome home, Mrs. Thorne,"" the housekeeper, Mrs. Gable, greeted her at the door with a warm smile.



""Thank you, Mrs. Gable. Where are Damien and Cora?"" Elara asked, removing her light jacket.



Mrs. Gable's smile faltered. ""Mr. Thorne is at the office. He mentioned he would be late today. Cora is in the playroom with her tutor.""



Disappointment settled in Elara's chest, but she pushed it aside. ""I'll go see Cora then.""



Walking through the familiar hallways, Elara paused outside the playroom door. Laughter drifted out – her daughter's voice mixed with the tutor's. She entered with a bright smile.



""Cora, sweetheart! Mommy's here!""



Her six-year-old daughter looked up from her craft project, surprise rather than joy crossing her features. ""Mommy? I thought you were in New York.""



""I came to spend my birthday with you and Daddy,"" Elara explained, kneeling beside Cora's chair.



Cora's attention quickly returned to her project – a handmade card decorated with glitter and stickers. ""Look what I'm making!""



""It's beautiful, sweetheart. Is it for Daddy?"" Elara asked, eager to connect.



""No, it's for Auntie Vivi. She's taking me to the zoo tomorrow!"" Cora exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.



Elara's smile froze. Vivienne Dubois – Damien's not-so-secret mistress and, painfully, Elara's half-sister. ""That's... nice of her.""



""She's the best! She always brings me presents and takes me fun places,"" Cora continued, unaware of the knife twisting in her mother's heart.



""I see,"" Elara managed. ""Well, I'm here now. Maybe we can do something special together?""



Cora shrugged. ""But I already made plans with Auntie Vivi.""



The tutor, sensing the tension, discreetly excused herself.



Elara took a steadying breath. ""Cora, it's my birthday today. Don't you want to spend some time with me?""



Cora looked up, a flicker of guilt crossing her face. ""Oh. Happy birthday, Mommy."" She hesitated, then returned to her card. ""Can I finish this first? It's really important.""



More important than me, Elara thought bitterly. She stood, forcing a smile. ""Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you at dinner.""



Retreating to the master bedroom, Elara unpacked her suitcase with methodical movements, fighting back tears. She had hoped this trip would be different – that maybe, just maybe, her husband and daughter would remember her birthday, would want to celebrate with her.



Her phone buzzed with a message from Damien: ""Working late. Don't wait for dinner.""



No acknowledgment of her arrival. No mention of her birthday. Just another dismissal.



Hours later, Elara sat alone at the dinner table, picking at her food as Cora chatted excitedly about her day with the tutor and her plans with ""Auntie Vivi.""



""Daddy said he might come to the zoo too, if he finishes his meetings,"" Cora announced.



Elara's fork clattered against her plate. ""Did he? That would be nice.""



""Uh-huh! We're going to have ice cream after, and Auntie Vivi said I could stay up late to watch the new princess movie!""



Elara nodded, her throat tight. ""That sounds wonderful, darling.""



After putting Cora to bed, Elara waited in the living room. The grandfather clock ticked away the minutes, then hours. At midnight, the front door finally opened.



Damien entered, his tall frame silhouetted against the doorway, surprise registering on his face when he saw her.



""You're still awake,"" he stated, loosening his tie.



""It's my birthday,"" Elara said softly.



His expression didn't change. ""Is it? I apologize for forgetting. Happy birthday, Elara.""



Seven years of marriage, and he couldn't remember the date. Seven years of loving him, and he couldn't muster even a hint of warmth.



""Thank you,"" she replied, her voice hollow.



""I have an early meeting tomorrow. Goodnight."" He turned toward the guest bedroom he had been occupying for months.



""Damien,"" she called after him. ""I was hoping we could have lunch together tomorrow. Since you missed dinner tonight.""



He paused. ""I'll check my schedule.""



The next morning, Elara woke early, determined to salvage something from this trip. She chose her outfit carefully – a blue dress Damien had once commented on years ago – and styled her hair with extra care.



Passing by Cora's room, she overheard her daughter talking on the phone.



""I can't wait to see you, Auntie Vivi! I wish you could be my mommy instead.""



Elara froze, her hand on the doorknob. The words pierced through her like physical pain.



""My real mommy is here, but she's always sad. Daddy doesn't smile when she's around. I like it better when it's just us with you.""



Backing away silently, Elara retreated to her room, the cruel words echoing in her mind. She sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face.



At noon, she composed herself enough to check if Damien would keep their lunch date. His assistant answered.



""I'm sorry, Mrs. Thorne. Mr. Thorne had a change of plans. He left the office an hour ago.""



Elara thanked her and hung up. On impulse, she drove to Damien's favorite restaurant. As she approached the entrance, she saw them through the window – Damien, Vivienne, and Cora, laughing together at a corner table. The perfect family portrait, with no space for her.



Something hardened inside Elara. Seven years of hoping, waiting, trying. Seven years of watching her husband love another woman – her own half-sister. Seven years of losing her daughter's affection to that same woman.



Enough.



She drove back to the estate with newfound clarity. In the home office, she drafted a divorce agreement – fair, generous even. She had no interest in Damien's money or properties. She wanted only what was rightfully hers, including shared custody of Cora.



When she finished, she sealed the document in an envelope and left it on Damien's desk with his name written in her elegant handwriting.



""Mrs. Gable,"" she called, finding the housekeeper in the kitchen. ""Please ensure Mr. Thorne receives this when he returns.""



Mrs. Gable's eyes widened slightly at Elara's calm demeanor. ""Of course, Mrs. Thorne. Will you be here for dinner?""



""No,"" Elara replied, her voice steadier than it had been in years. ""I'm leaving now. Please have my luggage brought to the car.""



Outside, the driver waited by the sleek black car. ""Where to, Mrs. Thorne?""



Elara looked back at the mansion one last time, at the gilded cage she had willingly entered seven years ago.



""To the airport,"" she said firmly.



It was time to reclaim her life.

...

Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his estate, the sleek black car coming to a smooth stop. Beside him, Cora bounced in her seat, still bubbling with excitement from their day out.



""That was the best day ever, Daddy!"" she exclaimed, unbuckling her seatbelt with practiced ease.



Damien smiled at his daughter. ""I'm glad you enjoyed it, princess.""



As they entered the grand foyer, Mrs. Gable approached them, her expression unreadable. ""Welcome home, Mr. Thorne, Miss Cora.""



""Mrs. Gable,"" Damien nodded, handing her his coat. ""Any calls?""



""Mrs. Thorne was here earlier today,"" she replied, her tone carefully neutral.



Cora's eyes widened. ""Mommy was here? Did she leave already?""



""Yes, Miss Cora. She left for the airport about two hours ago.""



Damien frowned slightly. ""I wasn't aware she was planning to visit.""



""She said it was a surprise,"" Mrs. Gable explained. ""She seemed quite upset when she left.""



Cora shrugged, already losing interest. ""Good. I didn't want her to ruin our plans with Auntie Vivi tomorrow.""



""Cora,"" Damien admonished gently, though without much conviction. He turned back to Mrs. Gable. ""Did she say why she was upset?""



""No, sir."" Mrs. Gable hesitated before adding, ""But she left this for you."" She handed him a cream-colored envelope with his name written in Elara's elegant handwriting.



Damien took it, turning it over in his hands with mild curiosity. ""Thank you, Mrs. Gable.""



""Daddy, can I watch my movie now?"" Cora asked, tugging at his sleeve.



""Of course. I'll be in my office if you need me.""



Damien walked to his study, envelope in hand. He placed it on his desk, intending to read it after checking his emails. Elara was probably just upset about him forgetting her birthday. It wouldn't be the first time she had written him a letter expressing her disappointment.



Before he could open it, his phone rang. Vivienne's name flashed on the screen.



""Vivienne,"" he answered, a smile warming his voice.



""I was just calling to say how much I enjoyed today,"" her sultry voice came through. ""And to confirm our plans for tomorrow.""



""Of course. Cora can't stop talking about the zoo.""



""I can't wait. And what about tonight?"" she asked suggestively.



Damien glanced at the envelope, then pushed it aside. ""I can be there in an hour.""



""Perfect. Don't keep me waiting too long.""



After the call, Damien gathered what he needed for the night. The envelope lay forgotten on his desk as he left, his mind already occupied with thoughts of Vivienne.



\---



Morning sunlight filtered through the blinds of Elara's apartment in the city. She had purchased it years ago as an investment property, never thinking she would one day use it as her escape.



The space was sparsely furnished but elegant, much like Elara herself. She had spent the night methodically unpacking the essentials she had brought from New York – clothes, toiletries, a few cherished books.



Sitting at her dining table with a cup of tea, she opened her laptop and logged into her bank account. With steady hands, she transferred just over three million dollars from her personal account to a new one she had created yesterday.



It was money Damien had given her over the years – ""spending money,"" he had called it. Money she had barely touched, preferring to earn her own salary as head of his secretarial team.



""It's not about the money,"" she whispered to herself, closing her laptop with finality.



Her phone vibrated with an incoming call. For a heartbeat, she wondered if it might be Damien, finally noticing her absence. But the screen showed Chloe's name instead.



""Hey,"" Elara answered, her voice steadier than she expected.



""You did it, didn't you?"" Chloe asked without preamble. ""You finally left him.""



""Yes.""



""God, it's about time!"" Chloe's relief was palpable through the phone. ""Where are you now? Do you need anything?""



""I'm at my apartment in the city. I'm fine, Chloe."" Elara's gaze drifted to the unpacked boxes. ""Better than fine, actually.""



""Have you heard from him yet?""



""No. I doubt he's even noticed I'm gone."" The truth of that statement didn't hurt as much as she thought it would.



""What about Cora?""



Elara's heart tightened. ""I usually call her every night when I'm away. I didn't call last night.""



""And?""



""And nothing. No missed calls. No messages asking where I am."" Elara took a steadying breath. ""It's clearer than ever that I'm not needed in that house.""



""You're doing the right thing, El. It's time you put yourself first for once.""



After ending the call, Elara showered and dressed with care. She chose a simple navy blue dress that she hadn't worn in years – something professional but distinctly not part of her ""Mrs. Thorne"" wardrobe.



She had one more tie to sever.



\---



Thorne Industries occupied the top floors of a gleaming skyscraper in the heart of the financial district. Elara had worked there for the past five years, rising to head of the secretarial team through genuine talent and dedication, despite the whispers about nepotism.



She bypassed the executive elevators she usually took with Damien, instead joining other employees in the main lift. A few gave her curious glances – Mrs. Thorne rarely came in without her husband, and never dressed so... ordinarily.



Marcus Cole, the Human Resources Director, looked up in surprise when she knocked on his door.



""Mrs. Thorne! I wasn't expecting you today.""



""Please, call me Elara,"" she said, taking a seat across from him. ""I won't be Mrs. Thorne much longer.""



Marcus blinked, clearly caught off guard. ""I... see.""



She placed a sealed envelope on his desk. ""My resignation, effective immediately. I've already prepared detailed handover notes for my team.""



""This is quite sudden,"" Marcus said, picking up the envelope cautiously, as if it might burn him. ""Does Mr. Thorne know about this?""



""He will soon enough."" Elara's smile was small but resolute. ""I've accumulated quite a bit of vacation time. I'd like to use that instead of working through a notice period, if that's acceptable.""



Marcus nodded slowly, still processing. ""Of course. That's perfectly within company policy.""



""Thank you. I've already cleared out my desk."" She stood, extending her hand. ""It's been a pleasure working with you, Marcus.""



He took her hand, his expression a mix of confusion and concern. ""Likewise, Mrs... Elara. If you don't mind my asking, what do you plan to do now?""



For the first time in years, Elara smiled without restraint. ""I'm going back to where I belong.""



As she left his office, Elara felt a weight lifting from her shoulders. Seven years of trying to be the perfect wife to a man who didn't want her. Seven years of dimming her own light to accommodate his indifference.



No more.



Her phone vibrated in her purse. She checked the screen – Julian Croft, her old college friend and business partner, the man she had abandoned her dreams for when she married Damien.



""Perfect timing,"" she murmured, answering the call as she stepped into the elevator. ""Julian? Yes, it's done. I'm coming home.""



The elevator doors closed on Elara Vance – not Thorne – standing tall, her face set with quiet determination as she descended away from the empire her husband had built, toward the life she had once forsaken.

...

Marcus Cole stared at the resignation letter long after Elara had departed. He had witnessed the cold dynamic between Damien Thorne and his wife for years. The countless times she had waited patiently outside his office door. The way her face would light up with hope at just a moment of his acknowledgment. The inevitable disappointment when that moment never came.



He slipped the envelope into Damien's inbox, knowing full well it might sit there for days before being noticed. Damien Thorne rarely checked items that didn't come with urgent flags from his assistants.



Marcus remembered when Elara first joined Thorne Industries. Despite being the CEO's wife, she had started at an entry-level position, refusing special treatment. Her intelligence and dedication had quickly propelled her up the ranks to head of the secretarial team.



All of it, Marcus knew, had been for Damien's attention. Attention that never materialized.



His intercom buzzed. ""Mr. Cole, Mr. Thorne is requesting the quarterly projections.""



""I'll bring them right in,"" Marcus replied, gathering the requested documents.



When he entered Damien's office, the CEO barely looked up from his computer.



""Just leave them there,"" Damien said, gesturing vaguely to the corner of his desk.



Marcus placed the folder down, noticing the unopened cream-colored envelope still sitting where Mrs. Gable had left it yesterday. Beside it was Elara's resignation letter, also unopened.



""Will Mrs. Thorne be joining you for the charity gala next week?"" Marcus asked, testing the waters.



Damien's brow furrowed slightly. ""I assume so. Why?""



""No reason,"" Marcus replied. ""The event coordinator was asking about final headcounts.""



Damien nodded dismissively, already refocused on his screen. Marcus left quietly, deciding against mentioning Elara's resignation. The man would discover it soon enough.



\---



Elara placed a potted peace lily on her kitchen counter, adjusting it until she was satisfied with its position. Sunlight streamed through the windows of her apartment, illuminating the space she was gradually making her own.



Her phone chimed with a text from Chloe: ""Lunch tomorrow? Need all the details!""



Elara smiled, typing back a quick confirmation. She set her phone down and surveyed the groceries she'd just purchased. For the first time in years, she had bought only what she liked, without considering Damien's preferences or Cora's picky habits.



The thought of Cora sent a pang through her heart. Three days had passed since she'd left the Thorne mansion, and she hadn't received a single call from her daughter. Not even to ask where she was.



She pushed the painful thought aside and began putting away her groceries. The refrigerator looked pathetically empty with just her items, but there was something liberating about it too. This space was entirely hers.



After finishing, Elara settled on her couch and picked up her phone again. She scrolled through her contacts until she found the number she needed.



""Hello, Sandra? It's Elara Vance,"" she said when the call connected. ""Yes, it's been a while... I was wondering if you could reserve a ticket for me for the TechFuture Exhibition next week? I'm planning to attend this year.""



She listened to the response, a small smile forming on her lips. ""Yes, that's right. I'm coming back to YodaVision. Julian and I have discussed it... No, I'm not with Thorne Industries anymore.""



The conversation continued as Elara confirmed details about the exhibition. When she hung up, she felt a surge of excitement. The tech world had been her passion before marriage, before she'd set aside her dreams to be Damien's perfect wife.



The rest of her day passed in a blur of productivity. She organized her home office, contacted old colleagues, and reviewed the latest developments in artificial intelligence that she had missed during her years away.



That evening, she realized she hadn't checked her personal email all day. She opened her inbox to find it disappointingly empty of any messages from Damien or Cora. Not even to ask where she was or why she hadn't come home.



Elara closed her laptop with a sigh. It shouldn't surprise her, but somehow the complete silence still stung. Had she really meant so little to them that her absence didn't even warrant a question?



\---



In Andoria, Cora's face crumpled as Vivienne zipped her suitcase closed.



""Why can't you stay longer?"" Cora pleaded, trailing after Vivienne as she moved around the luxurious hotel suite.



""I have to get back, sweetie,"" Vivienne replied, checking her reflection in the mirror. ""I have important meetings that can't wait.""



""But I don't want you to go!"" Cora's voice rose to a wail. ""It's not fair!""



Damien entered from the adjoining room, his expression softening at the sight of his distraught daughter. ""Cora, we've talked about this. Vivienne has responsibilities back home.""



""Then I want to go home too!"" Cora stomped her foot. ""I hate it here without Vivi!""



Vivienne knelt down, brushing Cora's hair back. ""I'll see you again soon, I promise. And you still have your daddy here.""



""It's not the same!"" Tears streamed down Cora's face. ""I want to go home now!""



Damien exchanged a glance with Vivienne before lifting Cora into his arms. ""Actually,"" he said calmly, ""we're going back next week.""



Cora's sobs quieted. ""Really?""



""Yes,"" Damien confirmed. ""I've already made arrangements to wrap up business here early.""



""Will you be at our house when we get back?"" Cora asked Vivienne eagerly.



Vivienne smiled, her perfectly manicured hand resting briefly on Damien's arm. ""I might just be.""



Damien's phone vibrated in his pocket. He shifted Cora to his other arm and checked the screen. It was Marcus Cole. He declined the call, making a mental note to check in with him later.



""Now, let's get Vivienne to the airport,"" he said, setting Cora down. ""And if you're good, we can get ice cream afterward.""



As they left the suite, Damien's thoughts turned briefly to the work awaiting him back home. Not once did he wonder about Elara. Not once did he consider what he might find upon his return.



The elevator doors closed on the three of them – Vivienne elegant and composed, Cora still sniffling but calmer, and Damien unaware of the seismic shift that awaited him back home.



In her apartment across the ocean, Elara continued her quiet revolution, preparing for a future she was finally brave enough to claim for herself. A future that would soon collide with the past she thought she had left behind.

...

Cora clutched her phone tightly, her thumb hovering over her mother's contact. She had already ended the call once, and now guilt gnawed at her. Dad and Vivienne were chatting in the next room, their voices a low murmur through the hotel wall.



She flopped back on the bed with a sigh. Mom would definitely ask questions. And if Cora mentioned Vivienne was coming back with them, Mom would get that tight look on her face—the one where her smile didn't reach her eyes.



Her phone buzzed suddenly. Mom calling back.



Panic flared in Cora's chest. She silenced the phone and shoved it under her pillow. The screen glowed briefly before going dark.



""Cora? Are you packed?"" Her father's voice called from the doorway.



She sat up quickly. ""Almost done, Dad.""



Damien stepped into the room, his tall figure casting a shadow across the carpet. ""Good. Vivienne's driver will be here soon.""



""I can't wait to get home,"" Cora said, excitement bubbling up again. ""And Vivi's really going to visit us there?""



Her father's face softened slightly. ""Yes, she'll be staying at the house for a while.""



""Mom won't like that,"" Cora mumbled before she could stop herself.



A flicker of irritation crossed Damien's face. ""Your mother doesn't dictate who visits our home.""



Something about his tone made Cora look down. She knew things weren't good between her parents. They barely talked anymore, and when they did, the air felt cold and heavy.



""Have you spoken to your mother today?"" Damien asked, his voice neutral.



Cora shook her head quickly. ""No. She's probably busy with work stuff.""



He nodded, seeming satisfied with her answer. ""Finish packing. We leave for the airport in thirty minutes.""



When he left, Cora pulled out her phone again. Three missed calls from Mom. She bit her lip, then turned the phone off completely.



\---



Elara stared at her silent phone, anxiety building with each unanswered call. It wasn't like Cora to call and hang up. What if something was wrong?



She paced her apartment, debating whether to call Damien. Their agreement had been minimal contact except regarding Cora, but surely this qualified.



Before she could decide, her phone rang. Hope surged until she saw Mrs. Gable's name on the screen.



""Hello, Mrs. Gable,"" she answered quickly. ""Have you heard from Cora? She called me but hung up, and now she's not answering.""



""Miss Cora is fine, ma'am,"" Mrs. Gable assured her. ""I just spoke with her. They're preparing to leave for the airport.""



Relief flooded through Elara. ""Thank you. Did she say why she called me?""



""No, ma'am. But children are fickle with their attentions,"" Mrs. Gable said kindly. ""Will you be needing anything from the house today?""



Elara shook her head, then remembered she was on the phone. ""No, thank you. I'm all settled in the apartment now.""



After hanging up, she walked to her window. The city sprawled below, busy and indifferent to her worries. She'd made the right choice leaving, she reminded herself. But moments like these—when the distance between her and Cora felt vast—made her doubt.



Her doorbell rang, startling her from her thoughts.



Her neighbor, Clara Hayes, stood in the hallway holding a plate of cookies. ""Thought you might like something homemade,"" she said with a warm smile.



Elara accepted the plate gratefully. ""That's very kind of you.""



Clara waved dismissively. ""It's nothing. I remember how it was starting over on my own after my divorce. Sometimes a friendly face makes all the difference.""



They chatted for a few minutes before Clara excused herself. Elara placed the cookies on her counter, oddly touched by the simple gesture. It had been ages since someone had done something nice for her without an agenda.



\---



Later that afternoon, Elara's phone chimed with an email notification. Crestwood College was celebrating its centennial next week. Her alma mater. The place where she'd first fallen in love with artificial intelligence—and where she'd met Julian.



On impulse, she decided to visit the campus. Perhaps walking those familiar paths would help quiet the restlessness inside her.



The university hadn't changed much. Ivy still clung to the old brick buildings. Students lounged on the grass, absorbed in their devices or conversations. Elara felt a pang of nostalgia as she passed the computer science building where she'd spent countless hours coding and theorizing.



""Elara? Elara Vance?""



She turned at the sound of her name. A tall man with dark-rimmed glasses was staring at her in disbelief.



""Julian,"" she breathed, recognizing him instantly despite the years.



Julian Croft's face broke into a wide grin. ""I thought that was you! What are you doing here?""



""Just reminiscing,"" she said, suddenly self-conscious. ""The alumni email about the centennial made me nostalgic.""



""Well, this is perfect timing. I've been meaning to reach out to you."" His eyes sparkled with excitement. ""Have time for coffee? The old café is still there.""



Twenty minutes later, they sat at a corner table in the campus café, steaming mugs between them. Julian hadn't changed much—still animated when he talked, hands gesturing to emphasize his points.



""So, YodaVision has expanded into predictive healthcare AI,"" he explained. ""The algorithms we started developing in grad school? They're the foundation for systems now being tested in hospitals across the country.""



Pride swelled in Elara's chest. ""That's amazing, Julian. You've accomplished so much.""



""We started it together,"" he reminded her. ""Your theoretical framework was revolutionary. I've just been building on it."" He paused, studying her face. ""Why did you leave, Elara? You were the visionary between us.""



The question hung in the air. Elara traced the rim of her mug with her finger. ""Marriage. Life. Choices that seemed right at the time.""



""And now?""



She looked up at him. ""Now I'm getting divorced.""



Julian's expression softened. ""I'm sorry.""



""Don't be,"" she said quickly. ""It's been a long time coming.""



A silence fell between them, comfortable despite the years apart.



""What will you do now?"" Julian finally asked.



Elara shrugged. ""Start over, I suppose. Though where, I'm not sure. The tech world moves so fast. I've been out of it for six years.""



Julian leaned forward, his eyes intense. ""Come back to YodaVision.""



""What?"" The suggestion caught her off guard.



""I'm serious. We need you. The company needs you. We've grown, but we've never found someone with your vision.""



Elara shook her head. ""Julian, I wouldn't even know where to begin. The field has advanced so much—""



""You'll catch up,"" he interrupted. ""You were always the quickest learner I knew.""



""It's not that simple,"" Elara protested. ""I've been working as a secretary, for God's sake. My skills are rusty at best, obsolete at worst.""



""So you'll refresh them,"" Julian countered. ""Look, we have a project right now that could benefit enormously from your perspective. It's a perfect re-entry point.""



Elara felt a flutter of something she hadn't experienced in years—excitement mingled with fear. The idea of returning to AI work was both thrilling and terrifying.



""I don't know,"" she said honestly. ""What if I can't do it anymore? What if I've lost whatever talent I had?""



Julian reached across the table, covering her hand with his. ""You haven't. Talent like yours doesn't disappear.""



""Six years is a long time,"" she insisted. ""The industry has changed completely.""



""But the fundamentals haven't. And neither has your mind."" Julian squeezed her hand before withdrawing. ""Just come tour the lab. Meet the team. No pressure, just see what we're working on.""



Elara hesitated, memories of her last days at YodaVision flooding back. She'd left to focus on her marriage to Damien, believing it was the right choice. What a fool she'd been.



""What position would I even fill?"" she asked, her voice small.



""Head of Research and Development,"" Julian replied without hesitation. ""The role has been waiting for you.""



""You can't be serious."" Elara stared at him. ""You've kept a C-suite position open for six years?""



""Not officially open,"" he admitted. ""But no one's been right for it. Not the way you would be.""



The confidence in his voice made something shift inside her. Could she really do this? Return to the field she'd abandoned, take leadership of cutting-edge research? The thought was simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying.



Julian watched her, patient but eager. ""Say yes, Elara. Come back where you belong.""



She opened her mouth, but fear froze the words in her throat. The enormity of what he was offering—a chance to reclaim her former passion, her expertise—collided with the crushing self-doubt that had grown during her years with Damien.



""But I... I..."" Her voice trailed off, revealing the depth of her uncertainty. Could she really step back into that world after so long away? Or would she fail spectacularly, confirming what a part of her had feared all along—that she had sacrificed her brilliance for a marriage that had never truly existed?

...

Elara sat frozen across from Julian, his offer hanging between them. Once, she would have jumped at this opportunity without hesitation. Now, doubt clouded her mind like a thick fog.



""Elara?"" Julian leaned forward. ""Talk to me.""



She took a deep breath. ""It's been so long, Julian. I gave up everything for my marriage. What if I can't get it back?""



""The Elara I knew wouldn't ask that question."" His eyes held hers steadily. ""She'd roll up her sleeves and prove everyone wrong.""



A flicker of the old fire stirred in her chest. ""That Elara disappeared years ago.""



""I don't believe that."" Julian tapped the table between them. ""The work you did on neural network applications was revolutionary. That brilliance doesn't just vanish.""



Elara stared into her coffee cup. For years, she'd suppressed her ambitions to be the perfect wife and mother. A wife Damien barely noticed. A mother Cora increasingly pushed away.



""What would I even bring to the table now?"" she asked quietly.



Julian pulled out his tablet and showed her the company's latest projects. ""We've expanded, but we're struggling with the intuitive interface algorithms you were developing before you left.""



As he explained their challenges, Elara found herself instinctively analyzing the problems. Her mind raced with potential solutions, connections forming like they used to years ago.



""You could approach it from a different angle,"" she said without thinking. ""If you restructured the decision trees to incorporate emotional intelligence patterns...""



Julian grinned. ""See? Still brilliant.""



Warmth spread through her chest—not from embarrassment, but recognition. This was who she used to be. Who she could be again.



""When would you need me to start?"" The words surprised even her.



Julian's eyes widened. ""Is that a yes?""



She straightened her shoulders. ""It's a maybe. I need to think about logistics.""



""Take the weekend,"" Julian said quickly. ""But I want you in the lab on Monday. Just to look around, meet everyone. No pressure.""



Elara nodded slowly. ""I can do that.""



As they said goodbye outside the café, Julian hugged her. ""It's good to see you again, Elara. The real you.""



His words echoed in her mind as she walked across campus. The real her. Had she been living as someone else these past years?



Her phone buzzed. A text from Eleanor Thorne: ""Family dinner this Sunday. Mandatory attendance.""



Elara sighed. Eleanor's ""mandatory"" family dinners were becoming more frequent since Elara moved out. An obvious attempt to force her and Damien together.



Before she could respond, another message appeared—this one from Sabrina Thorne, Damien's sister.



""Are you at Crestwood? Leo's friend thought he saw you.""



Elara frowned. Leo was Sabrina's son who attended Crestwood. How typical of Sabrina to keep tabs on her.



""Yes, visiting my alma mater,"" she replied simply.



Three dots appeared immediately. ""Meet me at the alumni center. I'm here for a committee meeting.""



It wasn't a request. Elara considered ignoring it, but decided against creating unnecessary tension. With renewed confidence from her conversation with Julian, she headed toward the alumni center.



Sabrina stood outside, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, tapping her designer heel impatiently. When she spotted Elara, her eyebrows rose.



""What are you doing here?"" she asked without preamble.



Elara kept her voice even. ""Hello to you too, Sabrina.""



""Don't you have work? Or are you still taking that 'break' from Thorne Industries?"" Sabrina made air quotes around the word ""break.""



""I'm exploring other opportunities,"" Elara replied.



Sabrina snorted. ""Like what? You've been Damien's secretary for years.""



""I was head of the secretarial department,"" Elara corrected. ""And before that, I was in artificial intelligence research.""



""Right."" Sabrina clearly didn't believe her. ""Well, since you're here, you can do me a favor. Leo's been complaining about cafeteria food. Could you make him those dumplings he likes? I'll have him stop by the house tomorrow.""



The old Elara would have agreed immediately. But Julian's words rang in her ears: ""The real you.""



""I'm afraid I can't,"" she said firmly. ""I have plans tomorrow.""



Sabrina blinked, clearly surprised by the refusal. ""What plans?""



""Personal ones."" Elara shifted her purse strap. ""Besides, I've moved out temporarily, as you know.""



""Temporarily,"" Sabrina echoed with a raised eyebrow. ""Is that what we're calling it?""



Before Elara could respond, two elegantly dressed women approached Sabrina.



""There you are!"" one of them called. ""We're about to discuss the donor wall.""



""Coming,"" Sabrina replied, then gestured vaguely toward Elara. ""This is... a friend. Elara.""



A friend. Not sister-in-law. Not even by her full name. Just ""a friend.""



The slight was calculated, designed to diminish her. Six months ago, it would have worked. Today, it merely reinforced her decision.



""Nice meeting you,"" Elara said pleasantly to the women. ""I need to get going. I have a business meeting to prepare for.""



She walked away before Sabrina could respond, her stride purposeful. With each step, her resolve strengthened. She pulled out her phone and dialed Julian.



""It's Elara,"" she said when he answered. ""I'll take the job. No need to wait until Monday.""



Julian's whoop of joy made her smile. ""That's the best news I've had all year! I'll email you the paperwork tonight.""



As she ended the call, a weight lifted from her shoulders. For the first time in years, she was making a decision solely for herself. Not for Damien, not for the Thorne family reputation. For Elara Vance.



\---



Two weeks later, Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his mansion, Cora chattering excitedly in the passenger seat.



""And then Vivienne said we could go riding again next weekend!"" Cora bounced in her seat. ""Do you think Mom will want to come too?""



Damien tensed slightly at the mention of Elara. ""Your mother isn't much for horseback riding.""



""She could watch,"" Cora insisted. ""I want to show her how good I am now.""



He didn't respond as they entered the house. Mr. Finch, the butler, greeted them in the foyer.



""Welcome home, sir. Miss Cora,"" he said formally. ""How was your trip?""



""The best!"" Cora declared. ""Where's Mom? I want to tell her everything!""



Mr. Finch hesitated. ""Mrs. Thorne isn't here at present.""



Damien frowned. ""Where is she?""



""Mrs. Thorne left on a business trip shortly after you departed,"" Mr. Finch explained. ""She called to check on Miss Cora several times.""



""A business trip?"" Damien repeated. ""What business trip?""



""I'm not privy to the details, sir,"" Mr. Finch said carefully. ""But she mentioned it would last approximately two weeks.""



""Two weeks?"" Damien raised an eyebrow. Elara had never taken a business trip in their entire marriage. Her work at Thorne Industries certainly didn't require travel.



""When will she be back?"" Cora asked, disappointment evident in her voice.



""I believe tomorrow or the day after, Miss."" Mr. Finch turned to Damien. ""Would you like me to try reaching her?""



Damien considered this. Two weeks was an unusually long absence for Elara, who typically revolved her schedule around Cora's needs. Still, he supposed she was entitled to whatever this was—perhaps some retreat related to the temporary separation she'd requested.



""No need,"" he said dismissively. ""I'm sure she'll be in touch when she returns.""



""But Dad,"" Cora protested. ""I want to tell her about the horses now.""



""You can tell her when she gets back,"" Damien replied, already checking his phone for emails. ""Go unpack your things.""



As Cora reluctantly headed upstairs, Mr. Finch cleared his throat.



""Sir, if I may... Mrs. Thorne seemed different before she left.""



Damien looked up sharply. ""Different how?""



""More..."" Mr. Finch seemed to search for the right word. ""Determined.""



""Determined,"" Damien repeated flatly.



""Yes, sir. And she took quite a few of her personal belongings.""



Damien processed this information silently. Their separation had been Elara's idea—a ""temporary arrangement"" to give them both space. He had agreed easily enough, seeing no reason to object. Their marriage had been one of convenience from the start.



""Alright,"" he said simply, turning toward his study. ""Have Mrs. Powell prepare dinner for six. Vivienne will be joining us.""



""Very good, sir,"" Mr. Finch replied.



As Damien walked away, he felt a fleeting twinge of something unusual—not quite concern, but a vague discomfort with the situation. Elara had always been predictable, dependable. This sudden two-week absence without detailed explanation was out of character.



He dismissed the thought almost immediately. If Elara needed space, so be it. It changed nothing about his plans or priorities.



Still, as he settled behind his desk, Damien found himself staring at her empty chair across the hall in the small office she sometimes used at home. For the briefest moment, he wondered exactly what kind of ""business"" had taken her away for so long.



Then his phone rang with an important call, and the thought vanished entirely.

Or why am I not picking up new interests?,"Hi, I'm wanting to discuss what's been happening just recently with me. Before you point out. Yes this is an Alt Account I'm using to throw any sort of mental health issue that I'd want to discuss anonymously. I just do not want to taint my main account, I just don't want people to see what's going on.

Now, I'll explain the few days before so you have some context. I recently had to take a break from a community server (if I want to be specific,, that's relating to a fandom called Countryballs, and used to draw comics for the subreddit) that I felt like I haven't belonged in anymore. I moderated here but I felt like I hadn't resonated with the server base itself. They act younger than I do, and are more into this gen z/alpha internet culture, yet I know I'm Gen Z (18 years old), I just don't really like keeping up with more and more of the recent internet. But that's a whole thing I'd want to discuss separately and now I'll get on topic.

After exiting out of the community. My brain at this point hasn't really picked up on anything new that it wants to improve on or pick up a new hobby with. It's not that I feel depressed and I feel like I can't do anything, or that if I encounter an error I will drop the hobby instantly. It's that my brain doesn't want to even *start* the process of getting into that hobby or interest.

It likes to sit and watch, I have no idea why something that I want to watch for example, like see I watch bands that I love, e.g Linkin Park, that doesn't and won't translate into ""You know what? I should start a band, I should replicate LP's sound"" or another example is coding. I watch something about coding a 3D Spinning Donut (Again I know it's random but I'm trying to get my point across), My brain doesn't translate it as ""You know, I should learn to code this myself"", even if it does think of that, it's only merely as a fantasy.

Why does it feel like my brain does not want to do or pick up anything recreational for that matter? I'm completely fine when it comes to maintaining a job, I've focused and did anything that required me to be there. But when it comes to recreational stuff, it doesn't feel like starting anything new for that matter. Like I am not in Level 1, it's the equivalent of buying a Steam game and it sits in your libarary, not even downloading or playing it for that matter. Is it that I am physically not stimulated enough? Do I need stimulants to get my brain into trying to learn things it sees?

(I have tried Coffee as a stimulant, and I do see myself doing some stuff that I would enjoy previously, but I can't tell if it's the Coffee doing it or that my brain acts like the caffeine is stimulating me and I'm only pretending that it works.)

I have Asperger's but I have recently started to think ADHD aswell as a possibility for that matter, I've only skimmed that it does negatively promote psychological inertia but before than I always avoided the idea of having ADHD, I just thought I get natrually distracted not to the point it interrupts my work. But again ADHD is sort of similar to Autism in terms of it being a spectrum and it effecting others differently.

I'm pretty upset at the fact I can't really pick up anything that I see as an interest. I really want to but my brain is constantly stuck on being lazy. You don't *need* to try and help, but I would appreciate people's own experiences, as I can probably apply it to my own lifestyle, thanks for reading.",1,1750851685.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I suppressed a groan as my muscles tingled with protest. The sun was just beginning to rise and I had already been up for over two hours. My fingers were raw from scrubbing the floor and cleaning the bathrooms. I didn’t have time to dwell on how tired I was though. I needed to make sure I was downstairs and standing at attention in the kitchen in ten minutes.

I didn’t have much time according to my watch and I quickly wiped some sweat off of my brow before rushing down the steps of the expansive pack mansion.

“Cutting it a little close there, aren’t you?” asked the cook, a kind elderly woman named Clara.

I grimaced but offered her a smile in greeting. “I had a lot to finish this morning,” I said but quickly took my post just to the left of the Luna’s chair.

I barely had enough time to catch my breath when the Alpha’s family strode through the double doors leading into the dining room. The cook and the other servants straightened but lowered their eyes to our Alpha and Luna.

Alpha Henry and Luna Evelyn were the definition of authority. They were well-respected by every pack member but also feared. Alpha Henry’s icy blue eyes were cold enough to freeze over an entire room and Luna Evelyn’s matching cool exterior made even the toughest shifter squirm with nerves.

The three young men who strode in after them were clearly a product of the two pack leaders. All of us servants straightened even further as the three sons of the Alpha and Luna marched in.

My heart stuttered at their large forms. They had to come in single file or they would have completely filled the doorway.

Lucas Sullivan was the eldest of the triplets. Even though it was only by a few minutes, he exuded the confident air of the oldest brother.

Lucas met my gaze and I quickly looked down again to avert my eyes. Not quick enough though. I felt the sternest brother stop in front of me.

“Like what you see, little servant?” he drawled, his voice low and deep.

I clenched my jaw, hating the way he once again brought attention to how much lower I was than them in the hierarchy.

I heard his two younger brothers chuckle at the joke, further adding to my shame.

Lucas stepped away from me without a care and sat down next to his father, effectively labeling himself as the right hand.

A little bit of tension left my shoulders as the next brother came up to me. Liam wasn’t nearly as cruel to me as his other brothers.

That didn’t mean the more playful of the triplets wasn’t intimidating though. Like his brothers, Liam was broad-shouldered and rugged. His deep, dark eyes looked like they could penetrate through any soul, leaving nothing hidden.

I snuck a glance up at Liam as he walked by me, immediately regretting it when I realized he was watching me just as his brother had been. He looked like he was going to continue to his seat, but when we met gazes, he smirked and walked right up to me. I tried to duck my head but not before the middle brother flicked my nose, bringing tears of pain and shock to my eyes.

“Keep your eyes down next time,” he scolded before he too sat down at the dining table.

I couldn’t even relax, even though two of the three brothers were now seated and leaving me alone. An equally large figure appeared in front of my eyes. I kept my head down this time, refusing to meet the gaze of the owner of the toned male chest in front of me.

“That’s right, keep your eyes down,” Levi, the youngest brother said with satisfaction.

My cheekbones burned but I didn’t need to see Levi’s dark eyes to know that they were glinting with pleasure at my discomfort. Although Levi was the youngest of the three, he was still terrifying and fed off of my fear and on my pain, just like his other brothers did.

Levi scoffed when I didn’t respond and went to take his seat next to Liam.

“Well, what are you waiting for, girl?” Luna Evelyn demanded. “Begin serving us our breakfast at once!”

“Yes, Luna,” I squeaked before doing as ordered, putting eggs and bacon on each of their plates.

“Be quick about it, girl,” Alpha growled, watching me with narrowed eyes. He scoffed.

Luna Evelyn sniffed. “And to think we took you in and gave you a practical way to pay your parents’ debt. Such ungratefulness!”

“My apologies, Luna,” I said, keeping my head bowed.

After my parents died in an accident, I was taken in by the Alpha and his family. I was informed that my parents owed a great amount of money to the Alpha and Luna. They announced that I would be their maid in service in order to pay them back.

I was only ten years old when I started cleaning and waiting on the whole family. They were all cruel toward me, ordering me to work from sun up til sundown, coming up with tiring chores for me to complete before I finally collapsed in bed each night, completely exhausted.

“You have managed to remember that tomorrow is our sons’ birthdays,” Alpha Henry said in a hard voice as I scrambled to get their coffees poured quickly but without spilling a drop.

If I made a minor mistake like that, the punishment would be severe.

“Yes, Alpha,” I said respectfully.

“I expect the decorations to be immaculate,” Luna Evelyn cut in, glowering at me like if it wasn’t, her sons would be cursed or something. “Everything must go perfectly. You’ll know what to expect if it doesn't.”

I swallowed thickly but bowed to her, ducking my head. “Yes, Luna Evelyn. I understand perfectly.”

Although I felt rotten by how they were treating me. I refused to cry.

I was going to be strong and continue to live the way my parents would have wanted me to.

 

\*\*\*

 

“Is this the best you could do?”

I turned to look at Jessie. She was the daughter of one of the higher ups of the pack and was studying interior design. She was sent to ensure that I didn’t mess up the decorations, despite the fact that Luna Evelyn put me in charge of them.

I tried to keep the annoyance out of my tone as I turned to face her. “What do you mean?”

Jessie gestured around arrogantly. “These are so typical, not special enough for the triplets’ birthday.”

I looked around the grand ballroom. I had chosen golds and bronzes to symbolize the status of the guys. There were balloons and bouquets of flowers strewn everywhere. The gold and bronze against the stark white table linens looked sophisticated to me, perfect for an eighteenth birthday celebration.

“These are some of the guys’ favorite colors,” I told Jessie as patiently as I could. “I’ve grown up with them so I’m fairly certain they’ll be accepting of the decorations.”

Jessie’s jaw dropped before her eyes narrowed. “How dare you imply that you know them better than anyone?”

Before I could protest that that wasn’t what I was saying at all, the door opened and the topic of our conversation strode in, their girlfriends hanging onto their thick arms.

I tried to school my expression. Melanie, Kira, and Annie were stuck-up and arrogant, so I felt they were the perfect match for the triplets. I wondered how long these girls would be around since the triplets go through women like they do clothing. It was rare for them to keep girlfriends for more than three months.

I heard Liam whistle low as he got a look at the ballroom. “Nice,” he said appreciatively.

“We’re here to check on your progress, little maid,” Lucas said as he approached, Melanie holding onto him tightly.

“You’re just in time!” Jessie shrieked, stepping forward. She pointed an accusing finger at me. “Hazel here claimed she would be the best mate to the three of you!”

I reeled in shock. “No-” I started to say.

“How dare you!” Melanie cried out, stalking forward. “You could never land our men!”

“Little bitch!” Kira snarled.

“You’re in for it now!” Annie added. “You’re nothing but a lowly maid!”

“Ladies,” I heard Liam warn, a clear warning in his voice.

I didn’t even have time to blink before a slapping sound rang out throughout the ballroom, a stinging pain accompanying it. My hand flew to my throbbing cheek and I stared at Melanie in shock.

...

Hazel’s POV





My cheeks stung like hell.





I stared at Annie in shock, not believing that she would actually lay her hands on me.





A wave of anger surged through me. I stepped forward, ready to deliver my own slap.





But Liam got to her before me. He snatched her hand mid-air and yanked it down.





She let out a sharp cry. “L-Liam, what are you doing?”





Fury marred his face. His eyes went so dark, they were practically black.





“Who gave you permission to touch her?” He growled.





I stopped in my tracks, shocked to hear his words. My eyes widened.





Was he—was he really defending me? No, it couldn’t be!





“I asked you a question!” He snapped, squeezing her hand tighter.





She blinked in shock. “You heard her! You heard what she said. How can a lowly maid like her call herself your mate.”





“It’s true,” Melanie added, eyeing me angrily. “That dirty little thing can never be your mate. She needed to be taught a lesson.”





Levi, her boyfriend, moved towards her so quickly that she stumbled back.





I couldn’t understand what was going on. What were the triplets doing?





I waited for them to turn around and laugh at me saying, ‘Oh, so you really thought we’d defend you? Silly girl!’





Instead, they kept glowering at the girls.





Only Lucas hadn’t said a word so far. His face was hard but he was always like that so it was hard to know what he was thinking.





Kira looped her hand through his, pouting. 





“Baby, Annie didn’t do anything wrong. Tell your brothers to stop,” she said in a whiny, cutesy voice.





It made me almost throw up in my mouth in disgust.





It was even worse when she started batting her eyes at him like a bat.





I waited to hear what he would say. As the eldest, he could easily shut this down and take their side.





I wouldn’t be able to say or do anything about it.





Surprisingly, he yanked his hand out of Kira’s grasp.





She stumbled back with a gasp. 





“I’ll tell you this only once, Hazel is our maid. She belongs to us. We’re the only ones who can touch her. Understood?” he snapped.





The three girls paled at his words. 





“I can’t believe you’re choosing that stinky maid over us, your girlfriends!” Melanie cried.





Annie nodded, starting to cry. I rolled my eyes at the dramatics. “We’re the ones who love you. We should be your mate. She will never measure up,” she added.





Their words sparked my fury again. “I don’t care about having your boyfriends as my mate!” I cried. “You can have them for all I care.”





“Are you trying to pretend that you don’t want them now because you’ve been caught?” Kira snapped.





“It’s your fault for believing Jessie’s stupid lie. I don’t want them. I’ve never wanted them. I don’t even want or need a mate at all!”





At those words, the triplets turned to me sharply.





Lucas’ eyes narrowed. “What do you mean by that?” He asked.





I shrugged. “I mean exactly what I said. I have zero interest in finding a mate. As a matter of fact, I hope I don’t have one!”





“That’s crazy,” Liam snapped. “Everybody cares about finding their mate.”





“Not me,” I countered instantly. “The only thing I want is to leave the Emberfang Pack as soon as possible!”





“Leave!?” Lucas exclaimed. “You can’t leave! You’re our maid. You have a debt to pay!”





I smirked slightly. “For your information, my debt will be officially paid off tomorrow, the day I turn eighteen years old.”





“You’re turning eighteen tomorrow? I never knew we shared the same birthday,” Lucas exclaimed.





“Exactly! You never knew or bothered to know. Which is exactly why I do not want you guys to be my mates whether you believe it or not.”





I turned to the girls who were watching our exchange with wide eyes.





“So you see? You have nothing to worry about, ladies. You can keep them as your mate. I don’t care.”





From the corner of my eyes, I saw Lucas open his mouth to say something.





I didn’t wait to hear whatever it was. I’d had enough.





Without a word, I ran out the door, praying that they wouldn’t try to follow me.





My work here was done anyway. The decorations were set. The caterers were ready. The DJ was ready.





I didn’t have any intention of attending the party.





What would a girl like me do at a party filled with stuck-up rich kids who would only look down on me?





Thankfully, the triplets didn’t try to follow me. The girls most likely held onto them to keep them from running after me.





Good!





I went straight home and locked myself in my room. 





As I crashed into bed, I couldn’t help but remember how the triplets immediately jumped to my defense.





It still felt so strange. I couldn’t imagine what they were thinking.





I sighed, turning over. I shouldn’t read too much into it.





They just saw me as one of their properties. Like a gold watch. Or one of those Bentleys they rode around town.





They hated people touching their things. That was probably why they reacted like that.





I’m sure they were probably thinking, “Nobody can hit her except us.”





I rolled my eyes. At least, I would soon get to leave this place once and for all. 





I would never have to deal with their drama anymore.





\*\*\*\*\*\*





I didn’t know when I fell asleep. The next thing I knew was that I woke up to incredible, blinding pain.





I let out a scream, arching my back in the bed.





Panic clouded my mind. Through the haze of pain and fear, only one thought pushed through: 'What the hell is happening to me?'





There was a loud cracking sound. My leg bent the wrong way. I screamed. Before I could get over that pain, my hand snapped too.





That was when I realized it—I was experiencing my first shift. 





That knowledge of that did nothing to reduce the pain. All I could do was shut my eyes tight and try to control my breathing while I waited for it to end.





Finally, the pain ceased. I found myself on the floor, shivering. How I got to the floor from the bed, I had no idea.





I gently picked myself up only to realize that I was on all fours. My fingers were gone, replaced by sharp claws. My skin was gone, replaced with shiny gray fur.





I was a full wolf. 





Finally!





A scent tickled my nose. I instinctively turned towards it, realizing it was coming from outside the room. I found myself rushing out the door towards it.





It was the most intoxicating scent I’d ever smelt. My brain went blank. The only thought in my head was that I needed to get to that scent!





I followed it, tripping and tumbling over my legs in my rush. Still, I didn’t stop until I got to the source of the scent. 





The place where the scent was strongest in the house.





A huge plain black door sat in front of me. An insignia of three golden crowns intertwined was painted in the middle.





I gasped.





The triplet’s private wing!





So that meant…this scent was…





A strange feeling filled my chest. I’d never felt anything like it ever before. Light and heavy. Complete and empty. All at the same time.





At that moment, I suddenly realized what this meant—the Sullivan brothers were my fated mates.

...

The door slammed open and the triplets waltzed in.





“I think we need to let the other guys get some of the girls once in a while,” Lucas said, laughing as they made their way into the house.





They’d been at the club all night, having fun with their friends and it’d almost turned into an argument—again.





“It’s not our fault that the girls only want us no matter where we go,” Levi said, smirking.





The dark house seemed to shimmer with their golden presence as soon as they arrived.





“Keep your voices down,” Liam shushed his brothers, tossing a can of soda at Levi’s head with blinding speed.





Levi caught the tossed can without blinking, smirking at his brother. “You’re getting slow, brother,” he jested.





Liam rolled his eyes. They headed to their wing. 





Lucas reached the black door with the emblem of the three golden crowns first. He grabbed the handle then froze. 





“What is it?” Liam asked, looking over his brother’s shoulder.





“Someone has been in here,” Lucas growled. 





They immediately went into attack mode. One thing about them, they hated it when anyone touched their stuff. Their rooms were out of bounds, even to most of the house staff.





“Do you think they’re still inside?” Levi asked, growling.





“Let’s find out!” Lucas slammed the door open and walked into the hall. His brothers rushed in after him.





But the hall was empty. The only presence left in the rooms was a faint, distinct but familiar scent.





The triplets froze at the same time. Their eyes jerked to each other.





“That scent…” Levi gasped.





“It’s definitely…” Liam added, wide-eyed.





Lucas finally hit the nail on the head. “Hazel!”





There was no mistaking her scent. She’d lived with them for years now. They knew her scent like the back of their hands.





But today, something was different. Very, very different. Today, her scent was like an intoxicating wine. It hit them like a blow to the gut. It nearly sent them into a frenzy. 





“She is our mate,” Lucas spat, disbelief in his voice.





Their wolves clawed at them, struggling to take control. They had to clench their fists tightly to keep their wolf from jumping out and rushing to claim Hazel wherever she was.





They found the room one by one, but all of them went silent. Each of the triplets lost in their own thoughts. 





Since they were identical triplets, they always anticipated the possibility of sharing a mate. But they never knew it would be Hazel.





“This changes everything,” Levi muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. “Do you think she knows?”





Lucas rolled his eyes at his youngest brother. “Of course, she does. Why else would she have come into our wing?”





“How do you think she is going to take the news?” Liam asked quietly. “Considering…”





He didn’t have to finish the sentence. They all knew what he was going to say: ‘Considering how we treated her in the past.’





They’d spent years making her life miserable. It was all just in jest but seeing how she reacted at the venue earlier, she didn’t seem to have found their jokes funny at all.





Fate had played the meanest trick on them by making her their mate. 





“What are we going to do now? She is our mate. We can’t live without her,” Liam exclaimed. 





“What if she rejects us?” Levi added wide-eyed.





“We will make her accept us,” Lucas said firmly. “She is ours. She’s our mate now. We can never let her go.”





Liam’s face hardened too. “You’re right. She belonged to us in the past even before this mate business. And now, she belongs to us in an even better way.”





“And we never give away what belongs to us to others!” Levi added.





They shared a smirk, an unspoken agreement passing between them: Hazel would be theirs, no matter what.





\*\*\*\*\*\*





\~ Hazel’s POV \~





By the next day, I was still walking around in a daze. 





‘It can’t be true! There’s no way the triplets are my mates! Surely, the moon goddess cannot be that cruel.’





Those three had been my tormentors for years! All I’d been waiting for was my opportunity to escape them forever.





But now fate was trying to bind me to them for eternity!? A lump grew in my throat, my heart pounding loudly. 





I went through my chores like a zombie, a million thoughts racing through my mind. My number one thought was: 





‘I must avoid the triplets at all costs!’ 





I couldn’t afford to run into them today. I wasn’t ready to face them. Once they found out I was their mate, they would be furious.





How could a lowly maid like me be their mate? They would definitely reject me. The thought sent a jolt of devastation through my heart.





I sighed heavily, gripping the mop bucket tighter as I made my way to the next spot I needed to clean in the packhouse.





As I turned the hallway, I almost bumped right into someone. With a little scream, I jerked backward, scared that I’d gotten dirty water on them.





As a maid, almost every person in the park was above me. A mistake like that could get me a serious scolding or even a beating.





“I’m so sorry!” I gasped quickly, looking down to make sure I didn’t spill any water. “It was all my fault. I wasn’t looking where I was—”





My eyes jerked up, only to clash with the last person I wanted to see right now. Jessie.





“You’re right! It’s all your fault, you stupid bitch. Why weren’t you looking where you were going!?” She screeched.





I sighed wearily. “I already apologized to you,” I pointed out.





“Would an apology fix my shoes that you splashed dirty water on? Do you even know how much these shoes cost, you filthy maid? It costs more than your life is worth!”





“The water didn’t get on you at all!” I cried. “I checked to make sure.”





“You’re not the one who is going to tell me whether it got on my shoes or not! Get on your knees and clean my shoes with your tongue!” She demanded.





My jaw dropped. “You can’t be serious!”





“Try me,” she spat. “Get on your knees, bitch!”





“I will do no such thing!” I cried. “The water didn’t get on you at all. And I might be a maid, but I also deserve basic human decency!”





“Are you talking back at me, you nobody? It seems you’ve forgotten your place in this pack! I’ll remind you,” she exclaimed.





I never got to know what she planned to do because we suddenly heard the sound of footsteps running towards us.





The scent hit me before they even arrived—mate. Our noise must have woken one of the triplets up! Panic rose in my chest. I dropped the bucket on the floor and fled like a frightened animal.





“Where the hell are you going? I’m not done with you,” Jessie shouted after me, confused at my sudden departure. 





Before she could follow me, she saw Levi rushing down the stairs. Her demeanor immediately changed. The cold, furious look on her face vanished, replaced by a sweet smile.





“Oh, hi there, Levi!” She said softly, putting her hand on his chest. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”





Levi barely spared her a glance. He shoved her hand off his body. A shocked look crossed her face but she recovered quickly. 





She smirked, moving closer to him again. “I was just teaching that silly Hazel a lesson before you came. If you’d come a few seconds earlier, you could have watched,” she said laughing.





She gave him an expectant look, expecting him to laugh with her as usual. But she was silenced by a cold, furious look.





“Don’t you ever—” he growled, taking a threatening step forward. 





Jessie stumbled back. Fear flashed across her face. 





“—ever, in your life, run your filthy mouth about Hazel ever again!”





A squeak burst out from her lips. She whirled around and hightailed it out of there.





Levi reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone and dialed a number. As soon as the person picked, he didn’t bother with pleasantries.





“We need to talk,” he declared.

...

I was among the first set of people to arrive at the triplet’s birthday party venue.





The caterers, DJ and other party staff were already running around setting up for the party.





I sighed heavily watching the organized chaos but I couldn’t help but feel proud of myself for putting all this together.





What in the world made me think that I could avoid attending the party anyway? I mentally slapped myself for having such a stupid thought.





Of course, I had to be here to do more maid duties and make sure that everything went well.





The housekeeper found me first thing this morning to pile on a list of more tasks for me to handle at the party. 





“Order of the Luna,” she said.





I was just glad that the Luna didn’t come looking for me herself. I was trying to avoid every single one of them.





But avoiding the triplets was turning out to be an impossible task. There was no way I could avoid running into them at the party.





My only hope was that they’d be too busy to pay any attention to me. 





Their friends would be here. As well as their girlfriends. Hopefully, that would keep them too busy to talk to me.





I still couldn’t believe that I was the triplet’s mate. Why did fate hate me so much? Hadn’t I suffered enough in my life already?





My eyes strayed to the other end of the hall where I noticed a figure staring at me. I peered closer. 





‘Luna Evelyn!’ I gasped. And she was standing right next to Alpha Henry. He was here too? My heart began to beat faster.





Did they already find out that I was the triplet’s mate? Was that why they were here so early? 





They would punish me for daring to stain their perfect bloodline. The punishment would probably be brutal.





Luna Evelyn lifted her hand and cocked her finger. The order was clear: ‘Come.’





A lump grew in my throat. ‘They are going to skin me alive,’ I thought.





I swallowed the lump and rushed to her, bowing respectfully. “H-hello, Luna. Good day, Alpha. I didn’t know you’d arrived.”





I held my breath, waiting for the onslaught.





“Are the preparations almost done?” She asked sharply, ignoring my greeting as usual.





“The what?” I gasped before I could catch myself.





“Are you going deaf, girl?” She asked.





“Y-Yes, ma’am. I mean, no, Luna,” I caught myself quickly. “Everything is going well.” A wave of relief crashed through me. She didn’t know yet! 





She turned away from me without acknowledging my answer and began to talk to her husband.





They started walking around the hall slowly, surveying the decorations. I held my breath, waiting for their verdict.





“This is absolutely gorgeous,” Luna Evelyn finally said. 





Alpha Henry nodded. “The white and gold theme was the best choice. It suits the triplets perfectly.”





“It screams royalty which is exactly what my darling boys are,” Luna Evelyn gushed.





I blushed deeply, happy to see the work of my hands being praised so much. My lips curled into a small smile.





“I knew it was the best decision to have Jessie handle the decorations,” Luna Evelyn suddenly added. “She did such a wonderful job.”





The smile died on my lips. Jessie? 





“We must remember to reward her well for this,” Alpha Henry answered. “Perhaps a gold chain? Or a designer purse?”





My heart sank. I wanted to scream that the decorations were all my hard work. Jessie had nothing to do with it!





But I dared not say a word. I swallowed my protest despite the budding pain in my chest.





The last thing I needed right now was to draw extra attention to myself. Not until I found a way out of this problem first!





Suddenly Luna Evelyn turned to me. “You’re still here?” She demanded. “Don’t you have something to do?”





“I’m sorry, Luna,” I apologized quickly and rushed away. From the corner of my eyes, I saw them walking out together. I breathed a sigh of relief.





I hurried over to the DJ. “Hello, did you get the list of the triplet’s preferred songs that I sent?”





He nodded. “Yes, I did. But it wasn’t stated if there is an order in which you want them played.”





I drew closer to him to go over the list together and work out a good pattern.





“Girls, she is here! Told you we’d find her here,” a voice suddenly interrupted.





I turned around and saw Melanie, Annie, and Kira staring at me with cold fury on their faces.





A wave of dread curled down my spine. ‘What do they want now?’ I wondered.





“You stupid bitch, what did you do!?” Melanie growled at me.





“What are you talking about?” I demanded. “I didn’t do anything. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”





“Don’t lie to us, you filthy maid. Tell us the truth!” Kira snapped, stalking at me.





I instinctively took a step back. “What truth? I have no idea what you’re talking about, for real.”





“I told you she’d just keep lying!” Annie said. She grabbed my hand, squeezing it tightly.





I cried out in pain. “What are you doing!? Let go of me!”





“The triplets broke up with us,” She snapped. “We know you had something to do with it! What did you say to them?”





My eyes widened. “They did what!? Why did they break up with you guys?”





The triplets usually changed women like they changed clothes but they usually spent at least three months with them first!





Their relationships with Melanie, Annie and Kira were barely a month and a half old.





Why would the triplets break up with their girlfriends? Could it be…Could it be because of me? Surely not! 





Were they really taking this mate business that seriously? To the extent of breaking up with their girlfriends because of me? I couldn’t believe it.





“The moment they took your side yesterday instead of ours, I just knew there was something nasty about you,” Kira snapped.





“Exactly! So don’t act clueless, you scheming bitch! We know everything!” Melanie screamed at me.





My heart jumped into my throat. What did she mean by that? Did they reveal to the girls that I was their mate? Panic seized me. 





“We know that the triplets found their mate!” Kira spat, confirming my fear. 





I couldn’t breathe.





She grabbed my shoulder, shaking me like a rag doll until it felt like my brain had gotten loose in my skull.





“Tell us who she is! Tell us, you bitch!” She cried.





Wait! I blinked slowly. They had no idea who the triplet’s mate was yet. My secret was still safe!





I needed to get out of here as soon as possible.





“Listen, ladies! I don’t know anything about the triplets breaking up with you! I haven’t even talked to them since the last time you saw me,” I cried.





Why wouldn’t they believe me? I was just as shocked at this information as they were.





“We don’t believe you!” Kira shouted. She raised her hand and struck me across the face.





Her open palm landed on my cheek with a loud crack. The force of the slap sent me reeling backward.





I crashed into something hard and cold before I could catch myself. There was a loud crash as it shattered on the floor behind me.





I whirled around and found myself staring at the broken pieces of a $500,000 glass sculpture decoration ordered specially by Luna Evelyn for the triplet’s birthday.



My heart stopped beating.

Starting a new role soon where I am going to be much more client facing (going to their offices, coffee catch up, etc) and will need to bring my laptop/notes to these meetings to access information during them. 

I currently have a backpack that I use to commute with to work on the train, but soon I will be driving much more so don't really need that support to carry all my stuff.

Assuming a brown leather messenger bag or briefcase would be the best look for bringing to these meetings and wearing with a suit. 

Any suggestions of what bag to get? Probably looking to spend $300 max for now (maybe a bit more since I can claim it on tax too).

1lk3aoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lk3aoo/the_blasted_heath/,The Blasted Heath,"He told me they felt an odd reluctance as the landscape revealed distant stone chimneys and gothic structures, jutting from the horizon. He told me their trek had led them to a gaping depression in the ground that encroached upon the surrounding valleys and glens.

The gray desolation that sprawled open to the sky had a crumbling town in the center of its yawning black maw. Though vast, the rocky farms and ancient cottages were so tightly clustered that it strained their eyes to even look at, he said.

It was challenging, trying to document his recollection through the fatigue of his broken bones and dismal hysteria. Nevertheless, as his voice strained forward, so did my pen, from his raspy scrapings to my chicken scratch scribble. I sat beside the bedridden jeweler as he recounted the events that transpired inside that blasted heath, an expedition on my behalf. The name was coined by my father, fitting not just for way back when, but for its modern cosmicity.

I came from money, born into a family of three brothers and three sisters, all spoiled while I experienced the typical firstborn neglect. I was treated as the glue one forgets at the bottom of a toolbox, noticed only when the other tools failed. So when all my siblings died, along with my mother and father, it came as no shock to find myself last in line for the inheritance, although being the oldest.

I was bitter in those days, wishing my family would simply melt away, until, in the most literal sense, my wish was granted. In their absence, money and worldly possessions became my only family, and I found myself willing to pay any price for another member.

My father, a respected foreman, led a team that uncovered a rock containing an unknown metal. It laid within a Native American burial ground, and he was instructed by the government to leave it untouched.

It wasn’t out of fear of ancestral warnings or the weight of colonial guilt that the authorities wanted it to be left alone. The law did not give a single damn about cultural respect or the scars of historical trauma. The rock, and the land around it, remained undisturbed because of the brooding, eternal death that seemed to cling to the cursed thing. Naturally, my father disobeyed, resulting in him and his men to meet their tragic end.

As my father’s son, I followed in his footsteps, assembling a team to finish what he couldn’t. But unlike him, I wasn’t driven by the hollow thrill of discovery, something he foolishly cherished. I longed to craft not an artifact just of wealth, but of meaning—something tangible to embody my struggles, my brilliance, my inevitability, my growing family.

With the unknown now slightly less mysterious, I was able to take the necessary precautions. I ensured I wouldn’t share my father’s fate by never setting foot on the site myself. Instead, I remained at the comfort of my own home, while my handsomely paid team carried out every instruction to the letter.

When the jeweler, my logistics coordinator and expedition leader, drifted back into consciousness, he asked a question. A question he visibly reconsidered before letting it fully form. 

“Why were we instructed to craft the artifact inside the cave?”

He was right. The portable devices did make the engagement exponentially more expensive. Without hesitation, I admitted that we were breaking the law. We had violated the Antiquities Act, which provides broad legal protection to cultural and scientific resources located on federal land. Put plainly, the government wanted it to be their discovery to profit by and not ours to meddle in. But, I wasn’t about to surrender this discovery forged by my own blood before me.

The gauze wrapped around the jeweler’s battered features swelled as his expression shifted to astonishment. Without a word, I saw the comprehension settle in as he then understood why they were under a time constraint and why the officials had arrived unannounced.

“Have you no shame?!” he asked. 

“It didn’t trouble me in the slightest,” I told him. I knew I hadn’t been entirely forthright about the whole ordeal, but if only he understood how the normalities of humanity were cruelly judged by the law, he might grasp how truly stifling such restrictions are to the human experience.

The jeweler snapped again, “Tell me, did money turn you into some rich fella with twisted habits, or were you always twisted and the money just let you show it?”

“Depends on the circumstance,” I said wryly, bringing our bitter repartee to a halt. As I swapped out the bag on his IV, I told the flustered jeweler to finish his account of what happened if he ever expected to see a dime. 

Hesitantly, he complied, offering up a few trivial details to prime his memory of the voyage. I don’t use the word “voyage” lightly either— another swindle tucked in the details.

In order to craft the finest trinkets out of a rare unknown metal, entirely within a cave, I had to assemble a specialized team equipped with portable tools and machinery designed for a remote, confined environment. 

I hired metallurgists and refinery technicians This specialized group was made up of five people, sharing the responsibility of transporting the portable power source.

I had mining technicians and ore processors. This group of four carried the portable smelting furnace.

There were the Goldsmiths and Bench Jewelers. This group consisted of three members who hauled the workbench, all the crucibles, and tongs.

Lastly, and most importantly, the jeweler. Master of every discipline, he knew planning and problem-solving like the back of his hand. As the expedition leader, he was responsible for overseeing the project’s logistics within the cave. He alone bore the weight of the lighting equipment and all additional safety gear.

We were dealing with a groundbreaking element and figured I’d be better safe than sorry. So last minute, I flew in a geologist and a mineralogist for a second and third opinion. Unfortunately it was that very safety that made me bitterly sorry for hiring those two in the first place. 

They were inseparable and the gentleman had set his heart on proposing that day. Counting the extra miners that helped with the pickaxes and drills, I hired twenty-five individuals in total, but about sixty people showed. Most of the workers I brought on knew each other beforehand, so when news of the anticipated proposal had spread, my employees decided to invite friends and family— an arrangement I wasn’t informed about. 

Their companions trailed my crew discreetly to keep the girlfriend, the geologist, from noticing. Their goal was to set up a small surprise celebration outside the cave for when the job and proposal were done. They brought grills, expensive cuts of meats, booze, balloons, confetti; all tiny weights that contributed to their colossal disappointment. Have they no regard for the moderation of leisure?

I’ll admit, I may have pitched the job as if the cave were tucked just off the coast of some glittering metropolis. I’m sure they likely expected coffee shops, malls, and a bit of civilized company. I almost wish I saw the devastation on their faces once they approached that blasted heath. Technically, I was truthful, though I did leave out the bit about the city falling into ruin and the cave lying beneath a church’s cellar. Even so, could they not comprehend the separation of work and play, or are they simply fools eager to escape the turmoil of daily life?

The jeweler continued, describing the venture inside the cavernous wound with introspective detail, his mood waning as the thrill of telling me about the festivities began to fade. 

He told me how beyond the church cellar was a staircase descending into a declivity deeper than the eye could fathom. Smothered in darkness, the team relied entirely on their voices to guide them each step down with the heavy machinery. 

The jeweler said he’d been trying to conserve the LED lights’ battery but was forced to switch one on when the mineralogist, the groom to be, took a spill down the stairs. By God’s grace, he added, they were already near the bottom. Still, all the team could do once he slipped was stand, and wince at every brutal slaps of his limbs against the concrete, as he tried catching himself the way down.

Expecting a fatal thud, they instead heard a cascade of clattering and rattles. At the base of the stairs was a sea of brittle bones, strewn across the floor of a vast, dome-shaped chamber. 

“At its center sat the rock, chaotically pulsing with a strange, dim glow that caught and scattered beams of our lights.”

The fear, the jeweler claimed, was intensely irrational, like an instinctive foreboding. No time was wasted arranging the lights or setting up the stations. Haste became an unspoken rule, stemming not from the constraint of time I had on them, nor the litter of human bones, or even the tightening grip of claustrophobia, but from something less tangible. The mineralogist’s demeanor had grown increasingly strange, his urgency only deepening the sense of disorientation for everyone. It showed in his movements, laced with a sloppiness and tension that made the others uneasy.

He became moody and combative, confrontational with anyone who didn’t match his pace. One of my technicians had pointed out his limp, revealing he was walking on a broken ankle, something that might have been taken care of had he not been so anxious. By the time the fluorescents were wired in, the man was already on his knees, hunched over the rock in silent examination.

Everyone had figured the poor guy was overwhelmed or nervous about the proposal. But, the jeweler said he’d later approach the scientist, urging him to get his ankle treated before examining the rock fully, but the mineralogist refused. He said he didn’t want to disappoint me and spoil this opportunity.  

Understandable, I suppose, considering I’d agreed to also pay for the wedding on top of his fee, if and only if they get the job done timely. Then again, it’s almost uncomprehendable how circumstances could change a man.

As the jeweler turned to leave him be, he noticed the mineralogist tugging at something in a panic. His arm was wedged deep inside one of the many cavities on the rock. Without warning, a burst of thick white fluid shot out, coating him up to his shoulder. It hardened almost instantly, sealing his arm in place. He screamed, not just from the pain, but from the certainty that he might lose his arm.

As the crew hurried over, the geologist knelt beside him, careful not to touch him. Her instinct was to comfort, but caution held her still. The substance clinging to his arm started to pulsate, like a slow deliberate breath. Everyone who could began running tests immediately to find a solution.

Analysis revealed something far worse than stone: a hybrid of metal and life equating to an organism forged of an alloyed plant. Unheard of. It responded to stimuli, shifting from liquid to solid at will. In an act of synthesis, it had bonded itself with the mineralogist. His arm was entombed in something sentient. Through further examination, the group realized, with great horror, that he wasn’t trapped in the thing, but was now part of it.

This was the moment the jeweler said he declared the crafting was to come to an abrupt and indefinite halt. No one were to touch another tool until they understood what this thing was, or at the very least, until they freed the mineralogist from its grip. But the substance defied every method of analysis with every probe yielding contradictions.

Eventually after a series of trial and error, a relieving, yet disturbing, implication emerged. They concluded that water acted as a flux, drastically lowering its melting point. The group capitalized off that piece of information using hydration to render it pliable, then using heat to break it down.

At this point in the jeweler’s account, I was on the edge of my seat intensely captivated, like a kid with late night hbo. He had stopped his telling with an abrupt wheeze, asking me another question that had me urging his curiosity to tread lightly. 

“With all the finest gold and materials at your fingertips, why this?”

I explained to him how desire walks a fine line between what’s allowed and what’s forgivable. Despite breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the need for this celestial-like metal. The collection I had accumulated after my family’s death became everything to me, more than family actually. It became a fixation that overpowered any sense of rationality. 

Loneliness amplifying my curiosity, twisting my desires into something uncontrollable, admittedly. I was desperate for it. Like the mineralogist working for his check and wedding, like the crew ready to drop everything out of fear; when desperation reveals, it defines. I know it sounds selfish but what is done will always be judged harshly until you’re the one doing it.

I neglected to explain any further, and once again, I shut down his ridiculous inquisitiveness, demanding that he finish telling me what he saw. He did so, continuing with what the mineralogist had said just before getting his arm stuck. 

“Just give me one more—“

He said it when he was first examining the rock, back when the jeweler was urging him to take care of his ankle. Our best guess was that he meant to say one more minute or second, but that wasn’t the point. The jeweler mentioned this because the obscenities the mineralogist began spewing were variations of this unfinished sentence. Things like, and I quote,

“One more! One more to even it out!” 

“I need one more—don’t you see? It knows I need it!” 

“It’s not enough—it’s never enough—give me one more!”

At first, the group dismissed the ramblings as post-traumatic hallucinations. As would I, but it wasn’t until it happened to someone else that he began to correlate this horrific-like phenomena.
 
At first she was composed and attentive, all while maintaining a smart distance. But when the mineralogist reached into his pocket with his free hand and pulled out the ring, the geologist lost it. 

She dropped to her knees, weeping like a baby, collapsing into her lover. The instant she fell into the mineralogist’s arms, the rock cracked open, shooting the same liquid onto the geologist’s shoulder, yanking her in. This was when the jeweler fell quiet for a second amidst his report, which spoke louder than his next words ever would. 

“She was part of it now,” the jeweler told me. “His right arm and her left shoulder were glued to that bolder. I’ve never seen something so achingly romantic and goddamn terrifying at the same time.” 

Back to his point before, her final coherent words before succumbing to the lifeform were exactly what anyone would expect. “Yes, of course”. What followed were words no one would anticipate. —And I quote, 

“Indubitably, it wills me.”

 “Thy will be done.”

“Yes, I’m made clean.”

Observation suggests that once an individual is consumed by this organism, they enter some kind of state of linguistic recursion. Their cognitive process is interrupted, derailed, then fixed to questionably unintended variations of their final spoken words. I say ‘questionably unintended’ deliberately because it’s possible what they’re saying is intentional, just not by them. 

I can’t stop imagining it— your own consciousness trapped in the state of mind of your last functioning moment. Unmoved by no circumstance, beyond the reach of any emotion. Though, only a hypothesis, the abstract nightmare bore a hole into my imagination, as it did with the jeweler’s. Yes, I continue to write this, though my documentation is starting to sound like pure fiction. As signs of his fever began returning, his voice grew hoarse and hysterical.

“Could it be cognitive disruption, a neurological glitch, physiological break, god help me— a supernatural interference!?” he questioned. “Merely thinking about this made me rethink the definition of a diagnosis.”

He described the events that followed as, and I quote, “ lovecraftian”. Who knew such a fidgety prude was into such literature.

It wasn’t long before the group’s panic had driven them to act. The jeweler, being the only levelheaded one at the time, yelled for some of the goldsmiths and miners to back away, but they were too caught up in the moment to realize how this chaos unfolded in the first place.

Repeating the same mistake as the couple, the bunch moved forward with urgency. Some had buckets of water while one of the goldsmiths wielded a flamethrower, disastrously claiming they were going to pry the engaged couple loose.

The jeweler weakly snapped his fingers. The color flushing from his face and the weight in his voice strained, “They all became part of…”

 I have to say, my jaw was on the floor during that slither of silence. I was no longer looking at what I was writing, but scribbling with my ears and listening with my eyes, if you could imagine. 

As expected, the rock discharge it’s fluid on to everyone in proximity. The resulting amalgamation of individuals, all stuck to a single rock, was nauseating to look at, he said. They scrambled and scraped at nothing, climbing over one another in attempt to break free. Some were yoked by their neck, others snagged by the chest or spine, and a few by their legs. 

As the jeweler continued to explain, he began calling them an ‘it’, as if the single mass of bodies struggling to break free were one being entirely. He noticed how ‘it’ seemed to undergo what looked to be a digestion period each time someone was attached. They would all stand and scream in unison as if the skin were being flayed from their bodies, twitched as if nerves were short-circuiting. Then came an off putting calmness, perhaps an awakening of consciousness, before each started to spew their own disjointed ramblings. In this case, the process took a while due to the sheer number of people entangled in the rock at once. 

Instantly, I questioned the jeweler on how they— ‘it’ moved. He explained due to arms and legs coming from every angle, it moved by perpetually tripping and catching its own fall. Momentum. When the mineralogist pitched forward, a goldsmith snagged by his neck would catch the fall. When a miner embedded at the chest lurched from balance, a metallurgist or ore processor pinned by their legs would plant a hand and shove. 

I doubt they were competent in carrying the workbenches down the cellar stairs, meaning this type of coordination was driven by some kind of outside influence for communication. A group delusion? Shared psychosis? Lord have mercy, a hive mind?

Naturally, the rest of the party dropped what they were doing and made a beeline for the exist, but ‘it’ calculated such, blocking the way. The jeweler managed to escape by the skin of his teeth, slipping through the chaos in the thick of the others’ demise. Only he and three other miners managed to make it back up the stairs and out the cellar doors.

“It followed us…” he added. “It had trouble getting through the cellar doors, but it still pushed even when ‘they’ looked dead. There was blood everywhere. Deep, deep abrasions and lacerations. Hyperextension. Posterior dislocations. I remember the geologist’s scalp was hanging off her head, and the damn woman was still mumbling stuff like ‘I do’! The abomination either loved the pain or didn’t feel it.” 

His voice tightened and quivering at the edges, his composure collapsing when describing his arrest on the premises. Earlier, officers had shut the celebration down and detained every friend and family member, threatening to jail every person that walked out of the cave. Once in custody, there was no point in saying anything, he explained. The jeweler said he just sat there in handcuffs, locked in a dissociative stupor as the three miners he escaped with, the police, and everyone around were consumed by the organism that followed them out.

The jeweler remaining entirely unresponsive while the others screamed and fled for their lives raised questions. Either they possessed something he lacked or the thing was downright terrorizing the poor bastard.

This led me to believe this cosmic ball of god-knows-what exhibited a clear reaction to the commotion. It’s safe to say it was even attracted to it. 

‘It’ eventually took the form of a swollen tumor, porous and bubbly. No longer was it catching its fall, but rolling over the individuals fused with it, driving through their disfigurement. The rock at its core was obscured by a dense accumulation of bodies. Beneath them, more people compacted, pressed tightly together. 

“When I looked up at that clusterfucker, I immediately saw her. Amongst them was my wife, Natalia. From the look on her face, my best guess is that she was upset with me in her final moments. Probably upset we were taking so long inside the cave, knowing her. I’ve never seen her so angry, and now she’s stuck that way. Stuck!” he said snorting, one that landed somewhere between a snicker and a grunt. 
“I don’t know what life is anymore. Amazing how the raw context of something so gritty can look so comical, an irrefutable concoction.”

The jeweler has officially lost it. The man started laughing so hard, his cackling reached an outright mutiny, but I somewhat understood what he meant. The mind retreats to laughter when it cannot bear the truth of what it saw— the same mechanism that binds comedy and horror. Both contain surprise and timing, tension and catharsis. This wasn’t madness, but the reward of survival. 

The man didn’t have to finish his account because I saw it all for myself. As if god himself took pity on this crumbling excuse of a human being, it began to rain. Not only did the rainfall snap him out of his cognitive shutdown, but gave him an opening. He turned and bolted for those cellar doors, with ‘it’ no more than a paper thin distance behind, and hurled himself down the concrete steps. Not the brightest move, but when death is imminent, circumstances defines. 

Even through shattered bones and barely clinging to consciousness, the SOB still found his way to the flamethrower. I figured what happened next was just like all those years ago when the rain also acted as a flux for the bomb strapped to my father’s chest. 

When I went down to retrieve the jeweler, the place was knee deep in a pinkish muck. Puss, blood, piss and whatever liquid the human body produces, I presume. He was drifting on the surface, swaying with bones and remains like a vegetable stew, struggling to keep his head above the sludge to breathe.

I don’t know how he got his grubby hands on it, but I had to pry the couple’s engagement ring from his hand, another factitious payment for the mineralogist. Who knew this piece of jewelry would be the catalyst of their demise, stemming back all those years ago when my father took it from these cursed grounds. It was nestled right next to this cosmic mineral.

I know my appetite for treasure was something I inherited from my father, but this ring is the one piece I want no business with. I keep it only because of the uncanny ways it constantly finds its way back to me. I’ve handed it off to nearly every group I’ve sent out here, only for it to return each time in pristine condition. Deep down, I’d like to think of it as an agreement between me and that rock: I keep sending it folks to feed on and it’ll reward me someday.

I helped the jeweler into a wheelchair, wheeling him to the window and presenting the crumbling city outside— my home town. This is the place my father destroyed because of his greed, because he couldn’t put the ring back. Like the feds, he had no cultural respect, trying to get paid off the scars of historical trauma. I understand because just like my view on the regulation of law, our desires are cruelly judged by humanity. 

And as I pointed to the wreckage of my childhood, he just kept laughing. I showed him the school where I was humiliated, the dead-end  jobs that bled me dry, and the house where I was overlooked by my own family in every way. He grew quiet when I pointed to the church I used to attend every Sunday morning. Where the town thought they could erase a Native American burial ground just by simply building a church over it. Where my father thought he could steal from lineages without suffering the weight of vengeance. 

There were no meteor-shaped organisms or flesh-fusing metals before he pulled the trinket from its resting place, I told the jeweler. I laid out my plan to keep feeding ‘it’ until one day, I send the right team capable of harvesting that metal. One day when I have the artifact made, who knows, maybe I’ll command troops from Hell. But ultimately, I will make my family and this rotten town toss in their grave for underestimating me.  

I pat the jeweler on the back and thanked him for his service as the 52nd team I sent out there. ",2,1750851365.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

\- Money seems to be a big issue within the relationship, he has 2 well paying jobs and is not hard for cash. For example, he will invite me out on a date, choose a restaurant, book a table but I end up paying. We went out recently to a zoo and for tea afterwards which he was expecting me to pay for and had made a comment/joke along the lines of ""I thought you could pay for once"" although I had paid for the tickets to the zoo (not cheap) and have also contributed more financially!

\- He has 3 kids and I have none, and he had a vasectomy after his third. He has said that he would get it reversed but obviously this isn't 100%. I do want kids in the future (absolutely not opposed to adoption). He kind of keeps rushing forward into the future and speaking about living together, however at this moment in time I am not too keen on the thought of sharing a home with 3 children under 15.

\- His birthday is coming up, I have booked a holiday for September for us which he is aware of to Spain and have probably spent close to £1,500.00 on additional, thoughtful gifts (not an issue, my own choice) however he keeps referencing and hinting towards me buying designer clothes for him, sending shirts that are £600+ so he can take nice pictures in them!

\- He doesn't seem to want to get to know me, doesn't seem too thoughtful/considerate etc. For example, whilst knowing what brand of coffee I drink, he replaced my empty jar with Aldi's own rather than the one I always buy. I have two cats and he always makes jokes about disliking cats. My birthday is the month after his and when I've asked what we're doing for my birthday if anything, he'd already forgotten the date.

Am I overthinking this? Can this be resolved with a simple conversation?

TL:DR financial and lifestyle differences with partner, looking for advice.

EDIT: I do not pay for everything all the time. He does pay his way but I feel like I pay more. It seems awkward when it comes to paying for things in shops, restaurants etc which is an issue I've never encountered in a relationship. He does have his positives and is a lovely person, he's trustworthy and loyal but as I've never had a relationship with somebody with those traits I don't know whether I'm overlooking the negatives and clinging to the positives.",2,1750851294.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

The frigid morning air nipped at my exposed skin as my mother's gentle shake stirred me from sleep. Her tired eyes held worry beneath the dim light of our basement room.

""Seraphina, wake up. Lilith demanded coffee in her chambers fifteen minutes ago.""

I groaned, pulling the thin blanket tighter around my shoulders. ""Let her wait.""

""You can't afford another punishment."" Mom's voice cracked. ""Please, sweetheart.""

Reality crashed back. I wasn't Seraphina Moon, daughter of respected Gamma warrior Silas Moon anymore. I was just Seraphina the Omega, servant to the pack that once respected us.

""Fine."" I swung my legs over the edge of the worn mattress, wincing as my bare feet hit the cold concrete floor.

Our quarters were a far cry from the comfortable cabin we'd occupied until three years ago. Now we lived in the windowless basement of the pack house, with just enough space for two thin mattresses and a small dresser. The scent of mildew clung to everything despite Mom's daily cleaning.

I pulled on the standard Omega uniform—gray pants and shirt that hung loosely on my frame—and quickly braided my blonde hair. The dye was fading at the roots, revealing my natural black. I'd started dyeing it after our downfall, desperate for any change that might make me feel like someone else.

Mom handed me a steaming mug. ""Drink something warm first.""

I accepted the tea gratefully. ""Has there been any word of Father?""

Her eyes clouded. ""No. The Silver Mountain Prison doesn't allow visitors or messages.""

Three years since my father had been framed for stealing from the pack treasury and conspiring with enemy packs. Three years of servitude and humiliation.

""I should go. Lilith will use any excuse to report me."" I drained my cup and kissed Mom's cheek.

""Remember—""

""Keep my head down. I know."" I finished her daily reminder with a sad smile.

The journey from our basement to Lilith's lavish quarters took me through the pack house's main hall. Morning sunlight streamed through high windows, illuminating polished floors that reflected my hurried steps. Pack members passed by, most avoiding eye contact. Some whispered behind their hands as I passed.

""Traitor's daughter.""

""Omega filth.""

I kept my gaze fixed ahead, refusing to show how their words stung. My wolf, Luna, growled in our shared consciousness. We are more than they know.

Not anymore, I reminded her silently.

I stopped at the kitchen to prepare Lilith's coffee—strong, with two sugars and a splash of cream. Just like she'd always taken it when we were best friends.

The memory of our childhood friendship twisted like a knife in my chest. We'd been inseparable since we were five, sharing secrets, dreams, and mischief. Until my father's disgrace changed everything.

I balanced the coffee mug carefully as I climbed the grand staircase to the east wing where Lilith, daughter of Beta Malachi Thorne, resided in luxury. My knuckles rapped lightly on her door.

""Enter."" Her voice carried that familiar haughty tone.

I pushed the door open and stepped into a room twice the size of our entire basement dwelling. Sunshine poured through floor-to-ceiling windows, highlighting the plush carpet and elegant furniture.

""You're late."" Lilith sat at her vanity, applying mascara with practiced precision.

""I apologize."" I kept my voice neutral as I approached with her coffee.

The sight beyond her made me freeze. Orion Nightwing, youngest of the Alpha's triplet sons, lounged shirtless on her rumpled bed. His muscular chest bore faint scratch marks, and his cool brown eyes met mine with amusement.

""The Omega finally arrives,"" he drawled, stretching like a satisfied cat. ""Thought you'd never bring Lilith's coffee.""

My cheeks burned with humiliation. Even after three years, seeing one of the triplets—my childhood protectors turned tormentors—in such intimate settings with Lilith sent pain stabbing through my chest.

""Don't just stand there gawking,"" Lilith snapped. ""Put it down.""

I placed the mug on her vanity, careful not to spill a drop. ""Will there be anything else?""

Lilith inspected her reflection, fluffing her perfectly styled auburn hair. ""How do I look, Orion?""

""Ravishing,"" he replied, his hungry gaze confirming his words.

She smirked, casting me a sideways glance. ""Remember when we were fourteen and you told me you had a crush on Ronan? How amusing that seems now.""

The memory of my girlish confession to my then-best friend stung. The triplets—Kaelen, Ronan, and Orion Nightwing—had been our childhood companions before they were sent to Alpha training. When they returned at sixteen, everything changed.

""I mean, look at you now."" Lilith gestured dismissively at my plain appearance. ""As if any Alpha would want an Omega.""

I kept my expression blank despite Luna's snarls. ""Will that be all?""

""Oh, I almost forgot."" Lilith reached for her coffee, then jerked her hand back, knocking the mug directly into my chest. Hot liquid soaked through my thin shirt, scalding my skin.

I gasped, jumping backward as coffee dripped down my front.

""Oops."" Lilith's smile didn't reach her eyes. ""How clumsy of me.""

Orion chuckled from the bed. ""Better clean that up, Omega.""

I bit my tongue until I tasted blood. ""I'll bring you another coffee.""

""Don't bother."" Lilith waved me away. ""Just clean this mess and get out.""

With trembling hands, I mopped up the spill with a nearby towel, ignoring the burning sensation across my chest. My wolf begged me to retaliate, but we both knew better.

""Oh, and Seraphina?"" Lilith called as I reached the door. ""I heard the Blackwater Pack is visiting next week. Maybe you'll finally find your mate and escape this pathetic existence."" Her laugh was like broken glass. ""Though who would want a traitor's daughter?""

I closed the door without responding, then leaned against the wall, fighting back tears. The front of my shirt was stained brown, clinging uncomfortably to my reddened skin. Another uniform ruined, another humiliation to endure.

Finding my mate was my only hope of escape from Silver Crescent Pack. But Lilith was right—who would want me?

As I descended the stairs, a tall figure in the black uniform of the Alpha guard approached. Corbin, Kaelen Nightwing's personal guard, wore his usual stern expression.

""Seraphina Moon.""

My heart sank further. ""Yes?""

""Kaelen calls for you."" Corbin's eyes flicked to my stained shirt before returning to my face. ""He seemed really furious.""

Perfect. The eldest triplet summoning me while in a rage—exactly what I needed after Lilith's morning torture. Whatever Kaelen wanted, it couldn't be good.

As I followed Corbin toward the Alpha's office, dread weighed heavy in my stomach. The triplets had once been my friends, my protectors. Now they were my nightmares.

And I was walking straight into the den of the most dangerous one.



...



My heart raced as I stood outside Kaelen's door. Corbin knocked sharply before pushing me inside.



""She's here, Alpha,"" he announced, closing the door behind me.



I stepped into chaos. Kaelen's usually pristine room looked like a hurricane had torn through it. Clothes were strewn across the floor, drawers pulled out, and even the mattress was half off the bed. In the middle of the destruction stood Kaelen, his green eyes burning with fury as they landed on me.



""You!"" he snarled, stalking forward. ""Where is it?""



I took an instinctive step back, my spine hitting the closed door. ""Where is what?""



""Don't play dumb!"" His fist slammed against the wall beside my head, making me flinch. ""The diamond necklace I bought for Lilith. It was in the top drawer of my dresser yesterday.""



My mind raced. I had cleaned his room yesterday, but I hadn't seen any necklace. ""I-I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't take anything.""



""Liar!"" His face was inches from mine, his breath hot against my skin. His scent—pine and winter air—flooded my senses, triggering unwanted memories of when that smell meant safety instead of danger. ""Only you and Lilith were in my room yesterday.""



""I just cleaned, Alpha. I swear I didn't touch anything valuable."" My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm. ""I wouldn't steal from you.""



Kaelen grabbed my arm, his fingers digging painfully into my flesh as he dragged me deeper into the room. ""Then help me find it.""



I stared at the mess surrounding us. ""Maybe it fell somewhere during cleaning?""



""I've looked everywhere!"" He released me with a shove that sent me stumbling. ""That necklace cost more than your worthless life. I was going to give it to Lilith tonight.""



Of course. Another lavish gift for Lilith while my mother and I barely had enough to eat. The unfairness of it burned in my chest, but I pushed the feeling away. Now wasn't the time for bitterness.



""Let me help you look,"" I offered, already kneeling to check under the bed.



""Don't bother."" His voice dripped with disdain. ""If you stole it, you've already hidden it somewhere.""



I rose slowly, anger finally breaking through my fear. ""I didn't steal your necklace. I've never stolen anything in my life.""



""Like father, like daughter."" Kaelen's words cut deeper than any physical blow. ""Your father stole from this pack, betrayed our trust, and you're following right in his footsteps.""



""My father is innocent!"" The words burst out before I could stop them. Luna howled her approval in my mind.



For a moment, surprise flickered across Kaelen's face, replaced quickly by mocking amusement. ""Still clinging to that delusion? The evidence against Silas Moon was irrefutable.""



""Evidence can be fabricated,"" I whispered, immediately regretting my boldness when his expression darkened.



Kaelen moved so fast I couldn't react. His hand closed around my throat, not squeezing but sending a clear message. ""Watch your tongue, Omega. Your father confessed to his crimes.""



After being beaten for days, I wanted to say. After threats against his family. But I remained silent, knowing the truth would only enrage him further.



He released me and turned away, raking his fingers through his dark hair. ""You were in here yesterday afternoon. The necklace was in my drawer when I left. This morning, it's gone.""



""Lilith was here too,"" I said quietly. ""You said so yourself.""



Kaelen whirled around, eyes flashing dangerously. ""What are you implying?""



I swallowed hard. ""Nothing. I just... maybe she moved it? Or maybe it fell and rolled somewhere?""



""Lilith wouldn't touch my things without permission."" His tone left no room for argument. ""Unlike you, she respects boundaries.""



The irony was almost laughable. Lilith had been invading my privacy and stealing my things since we were fourteen. The silver bracelet my father gave me for my birthday, my favorite books, even small keepsakes—all had mysteriously disappeared after Lilith admired them.



""I'll help you look again,"" I offered, desperate to defuse his anger.



""I don't want your help. I want my property returned."" He stalked to his closet and yanked out a fresh shirt. ""You have until the end of today to bring me that necklace.""



""But I don't have it!"" Panic clawed at my throat. ""How can I return something I never took?""



""Figure it out."" He pulled the shirt over his head, muscles flexing. ""Or your mother will be the one to pay the price.""



Ice flooded my veins. ""Leave my mother out of this.""



""Then find my necklace."" His voice softened dangerously. ""It's simple, Seraphina. Return what you stole, and your mother keeps her position in the kitchen.""



My hands clenched into fists. We both knew what would happen if Mom lost her kitchen job. The basement cleaning crew worked in horrible conditions—the fumes made several Omegas sick last month. Two hadn't recovered.



""This isn't fair,"" I whispered.



""Life isn't fair."" Kaelen loomed over me again, and for a split second, I caught something besides anger in his eyes—something that looked almost like pain. ""You should have learned that by now.""



The memory of us as children, promising to always protect each other, flashed through my mind. How far we had fallen from those innocent days.



""Do you remember when we were friends?"" The question slipped out before I could stop it.



He stiffened, his expression shuttering closed. ""That was before I knew what kind of person you really are.""



""You don't know me at all anymore.""



""I know enough."" He stepped back, creating distance between us. ""End of day, Seraphina. Either the necklace appears, or your mother suffers. Your choice.""



I recognized the dismissal and moved toward the door, my mind racing. I had to find that necklace, but how? If Lilith had taken it—and I was almost certain she had—she would never admit it. It was her word against mine, and in this pack, there was no contest who would be believed.



As my hand touched the doorknob, Kaelen's voice stopped me. ""Why did you do it, Seraphina? Why steal from me when you know the consequences?""



The genuine confusion in his voice made me turn. ""I didn't steal from you, Kaelen. Not now, not ever. And neither did my father.""



Something flickered in his eyes—doubt, perhaps—before hardening again. ""End of day,"" he repeated coldly.



I slipped out, closing the door behind me, only to find Jaxon, one of the younger guards, waiting in the hallway. His expression held something close to sympathy.



""Everything okay?"" he asked, falling into step beside me.



""Just perfect,"" I muttered. ""Alpha Kaelen thinks I stole from him.""



Jaxon winced. ""Bad timing.""



""Why?""



""Because Ronan Nightwing is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy,"" he said, glancing nervously down the corridor. ""He's really furious and demanding for you.""



My heart sank. Two angry Alphas in one morning? What had I done to deserve this?



But I already knew the answer: I was born a Moon, daughter of Silas, the pack's scapegoat. And in the Silver Crescent Pack, that was crime enough.



...



Jaxon escorted me to Ronan's quarters, his hand gripping my upper arm like a vise. Each step felt heavier than the last. First Kaelen's diamond necklace, and now what? What more could they possibly accuse me of?



The answer came in the form of Ronan Nightwing's thunderous expression as his door swung open.



""Get in here. Now."" His voice cut like ice.



I stepped inside his immaculate room—a stark contrast to Kaelen's chaos. Everything had its place here, except for one open drawer that hung askew.



Ronan slammed the door behind me. His sea-blue eyes—so similar to mine—burned with rage.



""Where is my money?"" He didn't waste time with pleasantries.



My stomach dropped. ""What money?""



""Don't play dumb!"" He stalked toward me, backing me against the wall. ""The five thousand dollars I kept in my drawer. It's gone, and you were the only one who cleaned in here yesterday.""



""I didn't take anything!"" My voice cracked. ""I swear it.""



Ronan trapped me between his arms, so close I could smell his winter pine scent. ""You expect me to believe that? After what your father did?""



That familiar pain stabbed through me. ""My father was innocent.""



""Save it."" His face hovered inches from mine. ""Return my money by tonight or face the consequences.""



Before I could respond, the door burst open. Orion, the youngest triplet, stormed in, his brown eyes wild with fury.



""Where's the little thief?"" He demanded, spotting me against the wall. ""You've got some nerve!""



Ronan stepped back, frowning at his brother. ""What are you talking about?""



""She stole from me too!"" Orion jabbed a finger in my direction. ""Three thousand dollars, right from my desk drawer.""



My head spun. This couldn't be happening. Three separate accusations in one day?



""I didn't take anything from any of you,"" I insisted, my voice trembling. ""I just dusted and vacuumed. I never opened any drawers!""



""Liar!"" Orion snarled, Luna cowering at his dominance. ""Just like your father!""



The door opened again. Kaelen entered, his expression even darker than before.



""So she's stolen from all of us,"" he growled, surveying the scene. ""First my necklace for Lilith, and now your money.""



Ronan pinned me against the wall again, his face inches from mine. ""No more games, Seraphina. Where's our stuff?""



""I didn't take anything!"" Tears welled in my eyes. ""Please, you have to believe me!""



""Stop crying,"" Orion sneered. ""Save your tears for someone who cares.""



I tried to steady my breathing. ""Think about it. Why would I steal when I know I'd be the first suspect? It doesn't make sense.""



""Because you're desperate,"" Kaelen said coldly. ""And desperate people make stupid choices.""



""Or maybe she thought we wouldn't suspect her because it's too obvious,"" Ronan added, his grip tightening on my shoulders.



The walls seemed to close in as they surrounded me, three identical faces contorted with the same disgust. Once, they'd been my protectors, my friends. Now they looked at me like I was nothing.



""Check her room,"" Orion suggested. ""She's probably hidden everything there.""



""Already did,"" Kaelen replied. ""Found nothing, which means she's probably sold it already.""



""I didn't take anything!"" I shouted, desperation taking over. ""Lilith was in your rooms too! Why don't you question her?""



The silence that followed was deafening. Then Ronan slammed his fist against the wall beside my head, making me flinch.



""How dare you accuse Lilith!"" he roared. ""She would never steal from us!""



""Unlike some people's daughters,"" Orion added with a cruel smirk.



I saw my mother through the doorway, her face pale with fear as she peered in. Our eyes met briefly before she was pushed aside by someone else.



Lilith.



She sauntered in, her perfect curves wrapped in a tight red dress, lips curved into a satisfied smile.



""Did the little thief confess yet?"" she asked sweetly, running a manicured hand down Orion's arm.



""Not yet,"" Kaelen replied, eyes never leaving me. ""But she will.""



Lilith's eyes gleamed with triumph. ""Maybe she needs some... encouragement.""



Ronan's fingers dug painfully into my shoulders. ""Last chance, Seraphina. Where are our things?""



""I didn't take them,"" I repeated, tears streaming freely now. ""I swear on my father's name.""



""Your father's name means nothing,"" Orion spat. ""Just like you.""



Lilith stepped closer, her perfume suffocating me. ""You know, there's an old punishment for thieves in our pack laws. Something about the rooftop, sun exposure, and... what was it again? Oh yes, pepper.""



My blood ran cold. That punishment hadn't been used in decades—it was considered too cruel even for the lowest offenders.



Kaelen's expression hardened as he exchanged looks with his brothers. ""Get Lyra and Elina in here.""



""No, please,"" I begged, struggling against Ronan's grip. ""I'm telling the truth!""



Two maids appeared, looking uncomfortable and frightened.



""Take her to the rooftop,"" Orion commanded. ""Strip her and apply the pepper mixture. Let her kneel until sunset.""



Lyra's eyes widened in horror. ""But Alpha, the temperature today—""



""Did I ask for your opinion?"" Orion snapped.



""No, Alpha,"" Lyra murmured, lowering her gaze.



As the maids took me by the arms, I caught sight of my mother in the hallway, covering her mouth to stifle her sobs. Pack law prevented her from intervening against an Alpha's judgment. All she could do was watch as her daughter was led away.



""Mom!"" I called out, struggling against the maids' grip.



She reached toward me helplessly, tears streaming down her face. ""Seraphina, stay strong,"" she whispered.



The journey to the rooftop felt like a death march. Summer sun blazed overhead, already heating the concrete surface to painful temperatures. Lyra and Elina's hands trembled as they followed their orders.



""We're so sorry,"" Elina whispered as she helped remove my shirt. ""We have to do this.""



I nodded numbly, understanding their position. Disobeying an Alpha meant death.



The humiliation of being stripped burned worse than the sun on my bare skin. Then came the pepper mixture—crushed red pepper flakes mixed with vinegar—applied to my exposed body. The pain was immediate and excruciating, like liquid fire seeping into every pore.



""Kneel,"" Lyra instructed tearfully, gently guiding me down onto the scorching concrete.



The moment my knees touched the rooftop, I gasped from the burning sensation. Combined with the pepper mixture, it was almost unbearable. The midday sun beat down mercilessly as I knelt there, exposed to both the elements and anyone who might look up.



""We'll try to come check on you,"" Elina promised quietly before they left.



Alone on the rooftop, I struggled to breathe through the pain. My skin felt like it was being eaten alive by fire ants, while the sun baked me from above and the concrete scorched me from below.



As the minutes stretched into hours, my mind began to drift, seeking escape from the torture of my body. Memories surfaced—happier times when the triplets had been my friends, my protectors.



Kaelen teaching me to swim in the pack lake.

Ronan sneaking cookies to me during formal pack meetings.

Orion defending me against older bullies.



The contrast between those boys and the men who had ordered this punishment broke something inside me. How had we ended up here? What had changed them so fundamentally?



As darkness crept into the edges of my vision, I saw them again as children, their identical faces smiling at me as they promised to always keep me safe.



""We'll protect you forever, Seraphina,"" they'd said in unison, linking their pinky fingers with mine.



The memory was too much to bear alongside the physical agony. My body gave way, knees buckling as I collapsed onto the burning concrete.



The last thing I felt before unconsciousness claimed me was the pepper mixture burning deeper into my skin as darkness mercifully swallowed me whole.

...



A tightness gripped Kaelen's chest as he stormed away from Ronan's room. That look in her eyes—pure hurt and betrayal—shouldn't bother him. She was just an Omega, a thief's daughter. A thief herself.



Yet something gnawed at him.



""Search her room again,"" he barked at a passing guard. ""Every inch of it. Find my necklace.""



The guard nodded and hurried off while Kaelen retreated to his quarters. He slammed the door behind him, pacing like a caged animal. Why did Seraphina's tear-streaked face keep flashing in his mind? The way she'd looked at him, like he was a monster...



""Damn it!"" He grabbed the whiskey bottle from his desk and poured a generous amount. The liquor burned down his throat, but did nothing to ease the uncomfortable feeling in his gut.



A knock sounded at his door.



""What?"" he growled.



Lilith slipped inside, her red dress hugging every curve perfectly. She locked the door behind her and sauntered toward him with a predatory smile.



""Alpha,"" she purred, running her fingers up his chest. ""You seem tense.""



Kaelen took another drink. ""What do you want, Lilith?""



""Just checking on you."" She plucked the glass from his hand and took a sip. ""Did you find your necklace?""



""Not yet."" He turned away, staring out the window. The thought of Seraphina kneeling on that hot roof made his wolf restless.



""Was it expensive?"" Lilith asked, pressing herself against his back.



""Very."" He faced her again. ""It was meant for you, actually. An anniversary gift.""



Her eyes lit up. ""For me? Oh, Kaelen."" She reached up to stroke his face. ""I'm sorry that little thief ruined your surprise. But I'm sure I can make you feel better.""



Her lips found his neck, her hands sliding down to his belt. Any other day, this would be exactly what he wanted. Lilith knew how to please him, had been doing so for years. But today...



""I don't think—"" he started.



""Don't think,"" she interrupted, unbuckling his belt. ""Just feel. Let me help you work out all that... frustration.""



His body responded even as his mind wandered. Perhaps this was what he needed—a distraction from those accusing blue eyes that had somehow burrowed under his skin.



He grabbed Lilith roughly, spinning her around and pressing her against the wall. She moaned appreciatively as his hands found their way under her dress.



""Yes, Alpha,"" she breathed. ""Take what's yours.""



The words hit wrong. Yours. Was anything truly his anymore? Even his thoughts seemed to belong to a certain blonde Omega.



Anger surged through him—at himself, at Seraphina, at this whole mess. He channeled it into passion, tearing Lilith's dress at the shoulder, exposing more skin for his mouth to claim.



But as he bit down on her neck, his mind betrayed him again. Instead of Lilith's floral perfume, he caught a phantom scent of vanilla and honey—Seraphina's scent. When he closed his eyes, he saw blonde hair instead of dark, blue eyes instead of brown.



""Harder,"" Lilith demanded, misinterpreting his hesitation as teasing.



Kaelen obliged, rougher than necessary, desperate to drive Seraphina from his thoughts. He lifted Lilith onto his desk, papers scattering to the floor.



The door swung open without warning. Ronan and Orion stood there, taking in the scene before them.



""Started without us?"" Orion smirked, closing the door behind them.



Sharing women had never bothered Kaelen before—it was practically tradition among them. But today, with Seraphina haunting his every thought, he felt a strange reluctance.



Lilith had no such reservations. ""There's plenty to go around,"" she invited, extending her arms toward the other brothers.



Ronan approached first, capturing her mouth in a hungry kiss while Orion worked on removing what remained of her dress. Soon all three wolves surrounded her, their competitive nature emerging as each tried to draw the loudest reactions from her.



Kaelen watched his brothers take turns with Lilith, her cries of pleasure filling the room. He participated mechanically, his body responding even as his mind wandered elsewhere. To a rooftop. To a pair of sea-blue eyes filled with pain. His pain. His doing.



No matter how hard he thrust, how deeply he buried himself in Lilith's willing body, he couldn't escape the image of Seraphina collapsing on that hot concrete. The smell of pepper and tears. The disappointment in her eyes that had once looked at him with such innocence.



How had they ended up here? When had he become this man?



He remembered a young Seraphina, all skinny limbs and unruly black hair, following him around the pack grounds. The way she'd laughed when he'd taught her to skip stones across the lake. The birthday card she'd made him when they turned fourteen, covered in glitter that got everywhere.



Then the letter. The betrayal. The pain that had hardened his heart against her.



""Kaelen?"" Lilith's voice broke through his thoughts. ""Where did you go?""



He realized he'd stopped moving, his body still joined with hers but his mind a thousand miles away.



""Nowhere,"" he muttered, pulling away. ""I need a shower.""



Ronan raised an eyebrow. ""Everything okay, brother?""



""Fine."" Kaelen grabbed a towel, wrapping it around his waist. ""You two can finish up.""



He retreated to his bathroom, turning the shower to its coldest setting. The icy water shocked his system but did nothing to clear his head.



Seraphina's face continued to haunt him. The wounded look in her eyes. The proud tilt of her chin even as they accused her. She'd always been stubborn, even as a child. It was one of the things he'd—



No. He wouldn't go there. She was a liar. A thief. Just like her father.



But what if she wasn't?



He punched the shower wall, cracking the tile. His wolf howled in confusion, in frustration. In something that felt dangerously like guilt.



After his shower, he dressed quickly, ignoring the sounds of pleasure still coming from his bedroom. He needed to run, to clear his head in wolf form. Maybe then he could shake this unsettling feeling.



He was halfway to the forest when a servant came sprinting toward him, face pale with panic.



""Alpha Kaelen!"" the man gasped. ""Come quickly!""



Kaelen's heart rate spiked. ""What is it?""



""It's the Omega girl, Alpha. Seraphina.""



Ice flooded Kaelen's veins. ""What about her?""



The servant wrung his hands. ""She's on the rooftop. She's fainted in the heat. She's not breathing properly.""



The world tilted beneath Kaelen's feet. Not breathing? His wolf surged forward, nearly breaking through his skin.



""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding,"" the servant continued, terror evident in his voice.



Kaelen was already running, his heart pounding a violent rhythm against his ribs. This wasn't supposed to happen. The punishment was severe, yes, but not lethal. Not for a werewolf.



Unless she'd been up there too long. Unless the heat had been too much. Unless they'd made a terrible, irreversible mistake.



""SERAPHINA!"" he roared, racing toward the rooftop stairs, primal fear clawing at his chest.



What had he done?

1lk37qa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lk37qa,LOST MEDIA FOUND Image from the original photoshoot used for The Postal Dude,"This isn't AI generated, as it was uploaded to Getty Images in 2016.

The positioning of everything from bullets and gloves on the floor and even the strand of hair across his face match up perfectly with the original image we're all familiar with. This isn't the same photo, however, as it was taken from a lower angle. It also appears to be the original colour; note the blue coffee cup, which can't be seen in the original due to the image being cropped.

Two things that stand out in the high-res photo are the moustache (seemingly covered by his arm in the original) and a ring each hand.

Photo is by Chris Collins, who tragically passed away a month ago. Rest in Peace.

An archive of Collins' website lists Panasonic as one of his clients. Ripcord Games, who published POSTAL, were a software label under Panasonic Interactive Media. It's likely that the image used for the Postal Dude was a stock photo that Panasonic, and by extension, Ripcord had access to. They were largely responsible for the marketing materials. Who the model is remains unknown.

We just made it available to download (iOS + Android) so people can get notified when it officially launches this summer.

This isn’t another social feed chasing followers or ads. It’s more like a digital town square — made to support real connection, local discovery, and small businesses.

We’re focused on:

* Local feeds for events, rec leagues, markets, etc.
* Interest-based groups and pages (IRL-friendly, not spammy)
* Following places and people, without pressure
* Eventually: **relevant ads from Canadian small businesses**, not garbage dropshipping

You can check it out here if you’re curious:

But more importantly:  
**If you run a small business, what would you want to see in a local-first social platform like this?**  
Is there a way something like this could actually support your visibility or foot traffic?

Would love to hear thoughts from fellow Canadian builders — good, bad, skeptical — all welcome. ;)

Luna Lovette's POV

“Congratulations Luna, you are one month pregnant,” my pack doctor, Pavel announced.

Joy laced his voice, but I still felt something off, even though those were the exact words I had been waiting to hear for a long time, and my joy knew no bounds.

Finally, I was going to have an heir and secure my position as the Luna without fearing anyone usurping my authority.

It was straightforward for an Alpha to rule a pack without a Luna, but the rule was not the same for a Luna without an Alpha. Though both species trained well, she-wolves were still considered to be weaker than the werewolves.

That was my reason for taking this path, my heart exploding with the kind of excitement that had me clutching the test result tightly to my chest as if someone was going to take it from me.

All I wanted was to share this news with my best friend and whoever cared to listen, especially those cunning elders. About to leave the Doctor’s office, my exciting moment was soon flipped by what the doctor said next.

“But there is a problem, Luna.”

It was just as I thought. His behavior was suspicious, and I could not put a finger on it, but no matter the problem, I just hoped it wouldn’t affect the pup I was carrying in my womb.

“Problem? Is there anything wrong with my pup?” I hugged my still flat belly protectively, ready to strangle anyone who would dare to come close to hurting him or her.

The Goddess knew for how long I had wanted this, so how could I lose this child before he or she was born?

My heart tightened painfully at the thought.

“The fetus is fine, Luna Lovette,” the doctor assured me with a smile, but it looked forced.

Yet, hearing that my pup was fine was enough to put my mood back into a state of exhilaration. This was all I wanted, so nothing else mattered, or so I thought.

“I’m sorry, Luna Lovette, but there was a mistake with the semen you were inseminated with.”

I could feel my breathing getting faster, cursing internally at the probability of anything going wrong with this whole process.

“But you said my baby was fine, so how could there be a problem with the semen? I don’t understand.” I made it clear, but the heat of nervousness was all over Doctor Pavel.

As my most trusted doctor, it was a thing of worry, and I did not want to expect any more. I waited for an explanation, but the high temperature of edginess only thickened the air, making me wonder if I was a monster.

I always treated my pack members with love and kindness so no one would be afraid of me. Only the elders and my enemies saw my difficult side because of their double-minded ways.

“You were inseminated with the wrong semen, Luna.” His voice was so low, but due to how desperate I was to know, it sounded like a trumpet in my ears, but that did not look like a problem to me.

“Ah,” I released a breath I did not even know I was holding upon hearing this news, wondering why he was so nervous about it.

“That shouldn’t be a problem. Does the person want to be paid double? Just mention it. This pup means everything to me, and I am willing to pay any amount to keep him or her,” I explained, my smile unfading.

It had not been easy trying to get a pup. It’s not as if I hadn’t tried. Three broken hearts left me with this option. Each time, they would cheat on me or break up right before we could mate or anything.

The reason was the cliché, of my position. Indirectly, those scumbags wanted me to make them the Alpha of my pack when they couldn’t keep their eyes off the she-wolves.

I was done with them. Done looking for a man to call my own so this was my only option because, unlike others, I can never find my true mate. My late mother saved my life during a war by sacrificing my mate bond to the moon goddess, so I wouldn’t die and would always be protected.

As for my father, he also died in that dreadful war, just like every family I ever had. Due to that, I had to take over the pack at the age of thirteen.

That also left me an orphan, but don’t underestimate me. I am tougher than I look and smarter than anyone can think due to my experience in dealing with all those old foxes in my pack.

Finally, I was going to be a mother and also be able to give my pack what I would have needed a man for without one.

As soon as this child is born, I would only have to focus on the growth of my pack, which is a great responsibility for a twenty-four-year-old Luna like me.

“Luna, the wrong semen is from Alpha Kodak,” the doctor said in a whisper as if the mention of the name would cause his death, but yes, it could.

The test result in my hand fell on the table, and my knees grew weak. “Alpha what?” My lips trembled at the news. Alpha Kodak was heartless but very powerful.

I’ve always thanked the moon goddess for not putting me in a situation where I would need an form any alliance with him or any other pack because, according to those who did, Alpha Kodak would always dominate the whole process, winning with the greatest shares of all the arrangements.

So, among all the donors, how did I end up with Alpha Kodak’s semen? He wasn’t even part of the list.

It could have been any werewolf but not him and how did his semen end up at my pack hospital? This was too much for me to take.

“How did this happen?” My smile was now replaced with a deep frown, as I no longer found the news amusing. “How did his semen end up in our lab?”

This was a big problem I wasn’t prepared for. Alpha Kodak was among the richest Alphas, but that was not the problem.

He was cold, mean, and arrogant but I heard he was very soft and kind to his fiancé, Zeeva, so how could this happen? The more I thought about it, the greater the confusion suffocating my guts.

From what I heard, his wedding had even been fixed because his marriage was supposed to bring him great profit through the collaboration with the Alpha of the North whose daughter he was engaged to.

As soon as he gets married, he can have as many children as he wants.

“We were carrying out some experiments, but there was a mix-up with the semen because that of your donors were found to carry some strange genes.”

Somehow, the more he spoke, the more my heart sank as it only turned to drown me deeper into the sea of cluelessness. I have run this pack independently ever since I was thirteen, leading my warriors in every war and coming out victorious.

“My assistant had no idea about my arrangement with Alpha Kodak’s doctor and happened to use his semen instead. Because the experiment was a secret, we could not use his real name and hence the confusion.”

For the first time, I felt deflated and heartbroken. Alpha Kodak was engaged, but I could not attend the engagement party, having sent my beta in my stead. I couldn’t lose this child. Never, but that was when a brilliant idea formed in my mind.

“Alright. Kindly negotiate with him. I will pay him for his semen.” Since he has a fiancée, there will not be any complications with this arrangement, right?

I could see Pavel heave a sigh of relief, giving me hope that this matter would be resolved sooner than I thought.

“Okay, Luna. I will make the call and get back to you. You should go and rest now. Artificial insemination is not like other pregnancies, so you have to continue to exempt yourself from stressful physical activities until the second trimester. Even at that time, it should be minimal,” Pavel advised, and I rubbed my belly once more.

“I know. I will do anything to protect this pup. Let me know about the negotiation when you are done.”

I went to my room to rest as Pavel had instructed but my mind couldn’t. I needed closure on this matter, worsened by the intrusion of my best friend, Embry. She is the sister of my beta, Cassius.

“When were you going to tell me about the pregnancy? That I was going to be an aunt? I can’t wait to see the disappointed looks on the faces of those stupid elders. How do you even cope with them? I told you to let me take care of them a long time ago, but you won’t listen,” Embry kept blabbering nonstop.

Yet, it made me happy anytime she intruded on my privacy like this. No one could stand up to me except her, and that was something I treasured. Someone who would always tell me the truth no matter how much it hurts.

“It’s not ideal to announce it yet, Embry. There is a big problem,” I told her, I could feel the excitement drain from her face, seething through her voice.

“Tell me everything,” she demanded with genuine concern. I knew she cared, so I explained everything to her. She was so filled with shock that even I was beginning to lose hope, but as if that was not enough, my mind was soon invaded by a mindlink from Pavel.

“Luna, Alpha Kodak is not taking the news kindly. He’s demanding to have a meeting with you.”

# Chapter 2 – Arrange a meeting with her

Alpha Kodak's POV

Don’t worry, Alpha Marrock, I promise that your daughter will be well taken care of and the date for the wedding will not be changed. You know how I like things lavish,"" I assured my soon-to-be father-in-law.

Zeeva was being a baby, but I only have myself to blame because I pampered her too much. I can also understand her fears. I am a one-woman man, but I keep being pursued by many, which makes her uncomfortable.

After the engagement, she insisted on moving in with me, but I always liked to do things the right way and refused.

How could I know it would result in this? ""Alright, Alpha Kodak, I believe you, but can you assure her yourself?"" He asked over the phone. I did not want to.

I already spoke to Zeeva a few minutes ago, but she kept whining about the same thing as if she did not trust me.

It’s a fact that a lot of she-wolves lust after me, but I chose her because of my special liking for her. She is a very good woman, and I would not trade her for anything. I love her like my wolf.

But sometimes, I feel a little guilty. Marrying her would make me the Alpha of the largest pack in North America since our packs would be merged.

I’m not selfish, but to me, it’s always business first. My pack will continue to flourish and be the best, because my pack, the Silent Claw Pack, is already among the largest at the moment.

Before my dad returns from abroad, I want to prove to him how the pack has grown ever since he entrusted it to me.

""I will have to call her later. There are urgent things…""

As if I was cursed with excuses, a genuine one flung in when I heard an urgent knock on my office door.

""Come in,"" I excused myself from the phone and responded to whoever was behind the door. My beta, Raul, walked in with an air of urgency.

""Alpha, we have a big problem.""

Raul became my beta because he saved me from a trap one of the pack Alphas set for me before, and that Alpha became an obituary, but Raul became my beta.

He is the only one I can trust with my life, and if he says urgent, then it’s indeed urgent.

""Alpha Marrock, I’m sorry I would have to call you back,"" I apologized to my soon-to-be father-in-law, relieved to escape from Zeeva’s childish demands for a brief moment.

Though I was looking for an excuse to justify my hanging up on an Alpha of his status, what my beta said was far from what I wanted to hear.

""What is the problem?"" I asked in annoyance. He spoke hastily.

""Your semen has been used on someone else.""

I went stiff at the news, trying to process it the best I could. What a way to ruin my good mood! I could feel my wolf trying to take dominion, and I could see the fear in Raul’s eyes when he stared at me.

Anyone would wonder why my semen had to be kept at the lab, but that was the doing of our elders.

Due to betrayals from times past, this measure was put in place to ensure that should my beta or anyone else betray me to the extent of planning my death for my position, my semen would be used to breed an heir in my place.

That was how my father secured the title after my grandfather was murdered in cold blood, so it was something worth emitting.

What I did not expect was for it to be used when I was still alive and also about to get married to the woman I love.

There were things we kept from the public but our understanding of each other was all that mattered.

I don’t think any she-wolf would make me as happy as Zeeva does. Sometimes, she makes outrageous demands exposing her insecurity but I’ve always tried my best to make her happy with all the expensive gifts I could think of.

""Who is this person you are talking about?"" I was trying to subdue my wolf, but he was the one speaking through me at the moment, and it only coated the atmosphere with fear.

Jaguar, my wolf, was a lethal beast, and knowing that our heir was inside some strange woman, we both agreed on how wrong it was.

""That is what I was trying to find out, but they all seem afraid to say it. I suggest that you get the detailed information yourself.""

My blood boiled at the news, the temperature alarming. ‘That woman should not live,’ Jaguar growled, but I disagreed. That would mean killing my blood.

‘You are right, but I can’t kill my blood.’ Whatever she’s carrying is already destined to be my heir.

I could feel Jaguar relax. I was getting married, and yet, another woman was already carrying my child. There was no need to ask someone who did not have the answers I needed.

I rushed out of the office and sprinted to the lab. Anyone who saw me on the way was afraid to even greet me, but I could hear my beta’s footsteps behind me, and yet, I did not care.

The doctors seemed to be in a group meeting when I got there, and I saw the dread in their eyes when their gazes met mine.

They moved away to give me way, but I pinned the culprit against the wall, my fingers wrapped and tightening around his throat. My claws were ready to cut through his throat for making a mistake that could cause a great problem to the pack.

If my wolf took over, then Doctor Ken would be dead in a split second.

""Who did you inseminate with my semen? I want it back. I don’t want any woman except Zeeva to bear a child carrying my DNA. Do you know what that would mean for this pack?"" I growled, rage burning inside of me as his legs wagged in the air.

""A…Alpha…"" he was struggling to breathe, so I loosened my grip a little.

""Speak,"" I commanded him.

The terror in the atmosphere was very thick, but something happened to me when he spoke. ""It’s, Luna Lovette.""

My hand around his neck loosened instantly, and he fell hard on the floor, but I could not care less.

Quickly, he scrambled to his feet, gasping and panting for air. His face was covered in sweat as if he was drenched by rain.

""What did you say?""

I wanted to hear about a random girl I could pay after giving birth to my child, but how could it be a powerful Luna like Lovette? She was a respectable Luna, and I don’t understand how she would use such means when she could have any man she wanted with the click of a finger.

Well, that exempted me because I was already taken. I wasn’t sure that I even knew the face behind the name because nothing ever brought us together before.

All Alphas had a list of all packs with the names of their leaders and during mini-meetings, names did pop up. So far, Luna Lovette was the only she-wolf leader of her pack and it was one of the largest from what I heard.

But I had no idea about what happened between her and her mate. I never listened much to pack gossip, so that made me naive about her personal life.

""Alpha, Luna Lovette has been desperate for a child, and from what we heard from her pack doctor, she suffered so many heartbreaks, giving up on men altogether,"" my pack doctor Ken explained as if that would calm me.

The rest were trying to be as far from me as possible, and knowing why, I did not care. Jaguar easily gets out of control because of a personal matter I don’t want to go into.

Strangely, he behaves very well around Zeeva, so that makes her perfect for us since her destined mate rejected her at the time she turned eighteen, which happened to be my good fortune.

She was among the luckiest people to find their mates early, but also unlucky to lose him to another. Due to this, I always planned to make her happy to not regret our union or miss her rejected mate.

""All she wanted was an heir, and she paid four donors for it, but there was a mix-up when we were carrying out some experiments,"" Ken continued with his explanation since I hadn’t spoken a word.

My mind was too clouded on how to rectify this situation.

Luna Lovette might be a Luna, but she was also a woman. Since she’s carrying what belongs to me, she would have to dance to my tune, just like any other woman.

""Arrange a meeting with her,"" I ordered. I can give out anything but not my blood. Not my heir. That would be tantamount to giving out my pack.

Doctor Ken fished out his phone from his doctor’s coat and was about to dial a number, but the phone began to ring before he punched the digits.

""Speaker,"" I demanded when he looked at me with distress in his eyes. I could smell something fishy.

# Chapter 3 – My semen is not for sale

Alpha Kodak's POV

Doctor Pavel, I was just about to call you,"" I heard Doctor Ken say over the phone, as Doctor Pavel responded with a question.

""Have you broken the news to your Alpha?""

It seemed to me that the two had already discussed and come to some form of conclusion, but who were they to discuss something so important behind my back?

""Yes, and how did your Luna take it?"" Ken asked Pavel, and I kept listening, trying to figure out if it was some kind of plot between them and Luna Lovette.

I didn’t know her well and never heard anything negative about her character, but people do things. This could be a plot to take my pack from me, and I don’t plan to make it easy on either of them.

""She is ready to pay him for his semen,"" Doctor Pavel or whoever he was speaking to said from the end of the line. My anger boiled, and Jaguar was agitated. ‘We can’t sell our pup.’

‘I know.’ I assured him. Luna Lovette should know by now that I had no need for money and didn’t want any woman bearing my child who was not Zeeva.

""Doctor Ken, I don’t think that would work,"" Ken said correctly.

""What are his conditions?"" I heard Doctor Pavel ask, and for some reason, I could not hold my patience any longer, snatching the phone from Ken's hand.

""My semen is not for sale. Tell your Luna that I want to meet her."" I was not going to take any chances, and she better come up with a good explanation or bargain.

Doctor Pavel seemed hesitant, and just as I was about to make another demand, he answered.

""Her condition is very fragile at the moment. I have to discuss it first with her."" How can a powerful Luna like her be fragile? My suspicions increased even more. 

""You have ten minutes.""

""Can you please make it an hour? She must be resting now,"" Doctor Pavel pleaded from the end of the line, but I was trying to discern if he was just trying to buy time for her or for whatever they planned to do.

""Unless you don’t know the implications of what your error has caused, you will not be asking me for more time.""

He seemed to have caught the meaning of my words and nervously replied. ""I will get back to you shortly.""

I ended the call and waited. This was the future of my pack in the womb of another woman, and I could not think straight until Doctor Ken's phone rang again.

I still had it with me because of my suspicions and answered it. ""My Luna is ready when you are.""

""I’m on my way,"" I said without another thought. This was more important, and I had to get it over with.

I went back to my office with Raul and put on my coat. ""Call me if there is any problem. I will be back in a few hours.""

“Alpha, please let me come with you,” he pleaded, worry shining in his eyes. I knew he was afraid I would lose control but we were both leaders.

“Take care of the pack. You know you are the only one I can trust,” I said seriously, he bobbed his head in understanding.

“Alright, but please take it easy and remember that she’s pregnant. Artificial means have a higher risk of miscarriage,” he subtly let out, making me understand why Luna Lovette’s doctor said her condition was delicate.

“I will try my best.”

Not sure if this was a genuine mistake or a plan, I could not make any promises.

The Silver pack was just an hour's drive from the Silent Claw pack, and with this matter being heavy, I decided to go alone.

Luna Lovette’s beta, Cassius, met and took me to her living room. I must admit that Luna Lovette had great taste.

Before then, I took a close analysis of the things I saw in her pack. It was well-organized, and I saw most of her warriors training on the mountain with utmost seriousness. Her beta was with me, and obviously, she was not there, but everything seemed to move perfectly.

The pack was very neat, and her style of housing was splendid, choosing three-story designs. I had no idea how many families were hosted in one house, but it sure made the pack look bigger.

Her pack house was the tallest, a five-story building, and with our kind, no one would need an elevator but what surprised me was the underground living room I was taken to.

It was a blend of sophistication and feminism, but I could also discern she was a collector of artifacts as they were nicely displayed artistically around.

This was my first time in this pack, and I can applaud her for her success as I have been to many, considering she was a woman.

The struggle was not easy for Alphas, and yet, a woman like her was able to put it all together, ruling one of the largest packs in North America. Such a she-wolf was not simple.

""Alpha Kodak, please make yourself comfortable,"" she said from the top of the stairs, grace oozing out of her voice. I never looked at another woman for more than a second.

They were the ones constantly seducing me with their eyes, but somehow, I could not take my gaze off her. She commanded not only respect but also attention.

It took me a while to come out of whatever spell she seemed to have cast on me.

Her black pants and a turtleneck top, fit her perfectly, accessorized with the red shawl around her neck. Her brown hazel eyes carried a deep message I could not crack, but in my definition of beauty, she was it, charm, power, and grace, she was all of those.

Luna Lovette was not like the she-wolves I was acquainted with; there was something about her, something I did not have the words to explain, which made me careful around her.

A woman like her could easily make any man fall for her but that also brought me to the question of how those men were able to break her heart, her pack doctor disclosed.

""I’m afraid not,"" I refused. She did not try to seduce me, but it was better for me to be careful since I was already engaged and soon to be married. I never went back on my words and this was not going to be my first time.

Gracefully, she descended the stairs, sending the maids and her beta away with a wave of her hand. How splendid. Her bond with her beta and domestic workers was something of envy.

I had to talk my way through every situation but she just calmly did what a great man like me cannot do with just a wave of her hand.

""Coffee? Tea?"" She asked again, but I could not guess what she was up to. It was difficult to read her motives when she was like this and that tight smile was questionable.

What if she tries anything funny like drugging or poisoning me? I’ve heard those stories a lot of times, and I’d rather not fall victim.

""I prefer we move straight to business.""

She did not seem offended by my straightforward responses, rather stretching her hand towards me. ""Then let me welcome you to the Silver pack. It must be your first time.""

For some reason, I could not even give her a formal handshake, and this time, I caught the disappointment in her eyes, but it was very brief.

She stood in front of me but was not intimidated by my height or power. She was a Luna after all.

Eccentrically, I could not also smell her scent and could not make out the kind of wolf she had.

There sure was something outlandish about her, but that was not my reason for being here, and I was glad she got the message.

""Alright. This is the deal. I am ready to pay you ten million as compensation for the mix-up.""

I laughed internally but maintained a stern composure. On second thoughts, I needed the chair, so I lowered myself into her luxury sofa.

It was just the kind I liked, and she sat on the two-in-one sofa, a little far from mine. Eagerness shone in her eyes for my response, so I did not want to waste her time.

""I’m willing to pay you ten billion to be my surrogate,"" I countered, as I watched the color slowly fade from her face. ""It’s either that, or you give me back my semen.""

# Chapter 4 – I want the pup, but…

Luna Lovette's POV

As soon as Doctor Pavel informed me that Alpha Kodak wanted a meeting, I felt all my exhaustion dissipate. It had been hard to sleep with this heavy weight on my shoulder, and though Embry had insisted on coming along, I refused.

I needed a clear head with no distractions to lay my cards on the table.

This was something I had to do alone, which was why I chose my underground living room, reserved for special meetings like this. It wouldn't be right for the elders to know beforehand, so that was my reason.

I had seen Alpha Kodak from a distance, but having him this close for the first time felt awkward, especially since the reason for this meeting was not something I was proud of or wanted others to know about.

It was understandable why the she-wolves hyped him up a lot; he seemed like a clean freak with a great deal of perfection in terms of looks.

It's not a surprise with his great sense of fashion. His white shirt and black pants were neatly tucked in, and his hair was neatly trimmed, unlike most Alphas. Even with the coat he wore, which I'm surprised he hadn't taken off, his muscles were well-defined.

I rehearsed everything in my mind, trying to use my Luna charm to make him understand, but he seemed defensive with everything proposed, rejecting whatever I came up with.

This was unplanned, not that I wanted to be in a situation like this, but it was all because of my desperation.

Just as the rumors said, he was so arrogant. But since I needed this favor, I swallowed it all, except for the last part.

""I'm willing to pay you ten billion to be my surrogate.""

What made him think that I would give up a pup I desperately needed for money I didn't need? Even if I did, it wasn't worth the life of my pup. This was more complicated than I thought because he was being selfish.

Before I could refuse the demand, he slapped me with a worse one. ""It's either that, or you give me back my semen.""

I could feel the anger of my wolf, Olga, and it took me a while to calm her. Anger would destroy everything and lead to a possible war that would endanger the life of my pup, given that he or she was still in a fragile state.

I don't know how much time passed, but I was amazed by his patience. No matter how nice I wanted to be, his request drove me insane.

So, I stated it in a slow but firm way. ""I want the pup, but I can never be your surrogate.""

His expression turned cold, but his response was even more ruthless than the first and second. ""Then be my wife.""

To say that Alpha Kodak was cold-hearted was an understatement. I could feel my head spinning. 

Alpha Kodak was very good-looking, no doubt, and I knew how women drooled over him, but if he cared the least about his fiancée, he would not make this outrageous proposal.

To me, he was heartless, no matter how he tried to hide it under the special kind of swag that made him attractive, but not to me. I was done with the menfolk, and all I wanted was a pup. How is that so hard?

A bitter laugh left my mouth before I could stop it. ""Hahahaha, that is out of the equation.""

He looked offended, making another outrageous request. ""Okay. Then I want my semen back, or you abort the fetus.""

I subconsciously rubbed my belly a few times, unable to consider his solution. Over my dead body would I get rid of this pup growing in my womb?

""How can you be so heartless? You are engaged,"" I reminded him. ""You don't love me, and I don't love you, so what kind of marriage would that be? Why are you so selfish?"" I asked, my gaze not leaving his ferocious one.

He hadn't smiled ever since his arrival, but now, it was clear that he was upset, which I couldn't give a damn about.

Just when I thought I got him, his anger exploded, and with his eyes changing color, I knew his wolf was trying to dominate him, and it shone in his low growl as he spoke between gritted teeth.

""Did it not occur to you that the seed you are carrying is the heir of the Silent Claw Pack? Do you know the implications of giving birth to him out of wedlock? If you must know, that is the future of my pack in your womb.""

His words were like daggers, piercing into my soul. What have I gotten myself into? Feeling like the selfish one because I had forgotten about the importance of this pup to him, I lost all hope.

His conditions were absurd, but it made me feel rather helpless. ""Give me time. I will think up something, but your conditions are out of line.""

I could see him bloated with so much anger; I feared he was going to burst right there and then in front of me.

""I don't have time to drive back here. Every decision should be taken now.""

For the first time in years, tears stung the corners of my eyes, and I felt cornered by the pup in my womb. I could abort it and get semen from a random guy, but this was a life growing inside of me.

'If you think of aborting our pup, I will kill you before you go through with it,' Olga warned, not making it easy for me.

""You have a mate you are in love with. Do you not think about how she'll feel about all this?""

I tried as much as possible to not let my anger take control of me, and guilt flashed in his eyes.

Yet, it was gone as soon as it appeared. ""Leave my fiancée out of it. The major concern is my pup in your womb, and mistake or not, I won't allow you to have him or her out of wedlock.""

It was too much for me, and I needed to clear my mind. ""I will think of something to favor both of us, so please give me three days,"" I begged him.

I was the one carrying the pup, so I took the blame for the sake of my sanity. He seemed to be thinking about my words, and his phone rang in the process. Checking the caller ID, he did not answer it in front of me, but it must have been urgent, as it got him out of my packhouse.

""I will be back in three days, and remember, no games next time.""

I forced a smile. Surely, everything about me seemed like a game to him, but I couldn't leverage it. It just wasn't healthy for my condition.

""I don't play games, and I promise to have an answer ready by then.""

Without another word, he was out of my packhouse, and I did not care to walk him out. This did not end as peacefully as I thought, and all it gave me was a painful headache.

I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep, so I mind-linked Embry. 'Come to my room.'

It did not take up to five minutes for her to arrive in my room. ""How did it go?"" She asked worriedly. I broke down in tears and hugged her tightly, telling her the details of everything.

""I knew it. He's taking advantage of the fact that you are a she-wolf. I have a plan.""

She whispered something in my ear, and a smile bloomed on my face. I did not think Alpha Kodak had gone far, so I checked for his number in the pack's catalog.

The details of Alphas and their packs were all there. Typing the digits, I dialed his number. ""Alpha Kodak, I have a solution."" However, his response took me aback.

# Chapter 5 – The proposal

Kodak’s POV

This was the most unsuccessful and complicated meeting I've ever had in my life, especially considering that she was a she-wolf. I expected Luna Lovette to jump at the offer, especially since I had been informed that she had suffered multiple heartbreaks.

Then she just had to remind me about Zeeva. Yes, I love Zeeva, but my pack has no future without a pup. What assurance do we have that Zeeva and I will be able to have a child when we get married?

Some Alphas have suffered childlessness, so how can I let go of a pup from my seed? Additionally, breaking off the engagement would raise eyebrows.

It had only been a few weeks since we had that massive engagement party, so this was a big problem.

For Luna Lovette to have my child, we would have to wed in the most glamorous way, but I would be branded as a cheater.

We can't let the world know that she got pregnant by artificial means, as other Alphas would see our marriage as insincere. This situation was harder on me than on her, and I was trying to find a way to make things better for both of us.

My phone rang, and I checked the caller ID. It was Zeeva, and my heart skipped a beat for the first time in my life.

How was I going to break this news to her? Luna Lovette might think I gave her three days to figure things out, but that was for me to figure things out between myself and Zeeva.

One thing was clear: Luna Lovette was going to be my wife, whether she liked it or not.

However, I knew I had to address my relationship with Zeeva as well. I had made a promise to a powerful Alpha, and now I was going to have to go back on my word, which was unlike me.

Keeping two women was not an option. I loved Zeeva, but Luna Lovette was accidentally pregnant with my pup.

I answered the phone as I stepped out of the pack house, heading to my car. ""Zeeva, I'll have to call you later.""

Zeeva, as usual, wouldn't let me end the call without saying what she wanted.

This was the reason I had to hang up on her earlier that morning. I knew it was due to her excitement for the wedding preparations, but it was annoying at a time like this.

""Kody, I finally received the engagement present. A customized Porsche."" There was so much excitement in her voice that I hesitated to break the news to her, so I let her continue speaking.

""You are so sweet. How about I spend the night at your pack? I thought you were pulling away, but you were just planning something nice.""

Zeeva thought I was unhappy with her when she didn't receive a gift from me on the engagement day. I had ordered a Porsche customized to her taste, but it took longer than expected. I was relieved that it had finally been delivered to her.

""I'm glad you like the gift, but it's not a good idea for you to come to my pack. I'll be at yours tomorrow.""

I didn't have the heart to face her, especially since she always wanted to be intimate whenever we were together.

My father had taught me well. To be a great leader, always keep your zipper closed until you get married. This principle earned me respect among all she-wolves, and I was able to achieve it because I never started what I couldn't finish.

Horny creatures like us lacked the self-control to stop until it was too late, but Zeeva's insecurities prevented her from understanding, no matter how many times I tried to explain it to her.

""What's the point of being at my pack when you're so busy? I wanted to show you pictures of the decor I want for the wedding, and the caterer informed me that you haven't made the payment yet.""

A frustrated sigh escaped me as I pressed hard on the accelerator. I was about to make the transfer after speaking to her father before I was hit with the news about Luna Lovette. How could I explain that to her?

I was about to give a reasonable excuse, but Zeeva had more to say. ""Also, can you get me another car?""

Now I was getting annoyed. I loved cars, and once we were married, everything I had would be hers. However, I had to remind myself that it wouldn't happen soon, so I let her continue speaking.

""I already have two from Dad, and you sent me one. But I plan to use a different car every day of the week when I'm the Luna of the largest pack,"" she giggled.

""I..."" I started, but she cut me off, not allowing me to get a word in. ""Your pack, plus mine, will make us the most powerful leaders of all time.""

""Zeeva!"" I had to raise my voice over the phone to get her attention, which seemed to work.

""You sound upset,"" she complained, her voice already teary. I didn't know how to deal with a crybaby, but I only had myself to blame.

I had entered my car and was already out of the Silver pack. ""I'm coming to your pack. We need to talk."" What I was going to tell her might hurt, so I didn't try to comfort her as I usually would.

Ending the call immediately was the only way to prevent more whining from her. Just as I was trying to clear my head, my phone rang again.

Thinking it was Zeeva, I was about to end the call, but since I couldn't switch it off due to my position as an Alpha, I answered. To my surprise, it was a strange number, and Luna Lovette was on the line.

""Alpha Kodak, I have a solution,"" she said in a confident but calm manner. It was a level of maturity I wished Zeeva had, but I had to make my intentions clear to her.

""Luna Lovette, I have to warn you that any solution outside of marriage is not acceptable.""

My pup was not going to be born out of wedlock, and her silence indicated that she might suggest something other than marriage. However, her proposal caught me off guard.

""Let's have a contract marriage. After the child is born, you and I will have a duel. If I win, we divorce, and I get sole custody of the child. You can have visitation rights. It's the opposite if you win.""

I wondered if she had been drinking to propose such a challenge, but I doubted it given her situation. She might be tough, but could she really defeat me in a physical battle? Well, that made it easy for me.

""Alright, you have three months after the birth of our child to train. Let's get married in three days, and I won't take no for an answer.""

Silence fell once again, but when she spoke, it was as if she was fighting back. ""It's going to be a contract.""

I wondered how long she would remind me, but I had to make it clear to her. ""But I doubt you want anyone to know it's not real.""

""Fine, we can meet at the werewolf tribunal,"" she suggested. The werewolf tribunal was where marriages outside the mate bond were legalized or dissolved, but Luna Lovette had it all wrong.

""Who said that? I'm talking about a wedding,"" I explained calmly, but her response revealed that this situation was more complicated than either of us had anticipated.",1,1750850791.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The guy was the textbook definition of a micromanager, would ask for updates every 2 hours, CC'd himself on every email I sent, insisted on reviewing my work before I could even send it to clients, and had this annoying habit of scheduling ""quick check-ins"" that would stretch into hour long lectures.

He'd nitpick everything, from the font size in my presentations to the way I formatted my emails. Once spent 20 minutes explaining why I should use ""Dear Sir/Madam"" instead of ""Hi"" in formal communications. I used to vent about him to my friends constantly, calling him a control freak.

1lk33gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/derby/comments/1lk33gs/derby_made_the_new_market_place/,Derby Made - the New Market Place,"Read in the Derby Telegraph about the new assembly rooms.

Sounds an exciting project which could really support different communities and residents in Derby, Derbyshire, East Midlands, Staffs, the UK, and Europe.

What I would say is that everything in the Derby made design must really complement the city centre, especially the Quarters, the Council House and the new Market Hall in the Marketplace.



**Rooftop cafe / restaurant / bar / Radio Derby studios**

A new rooftop cafe / restaurant / bar / Radio Derby studio with views of the Market place will provide a new quirky place to have a coffee or a bite to eat for people working in the co-working space or for residents to try somewhere new with great views of the Quad and the Council house.

**A new Engineering / Renewable / AI / IT Derby made Library**

A new library could be successfully set up which really focuses on engineering. Cars made by Toyota and other companies, trains and trams built by Alstom and Bombardier over the years, giving a history of trains built in Derby. A section dedicated with designs and manuals by Rolls Royce focusing on cars and aero engines. It would also be good to have a renewable section on the history and advancements in green energy. Good to see a library of local companies in the library including companies like Vaillant. There could also be a techie angle with info on AI and IT. The Library could be a real engineering, renewable energy and techie hub and make it different from the local libraries.

What I would also say with the library is that nearly every library is the same. Lots of books and comfortable seats to enjoy reading. It would be great to see a quirky idea like having a model railway set up all the way round the library. It could then go round the track once in the morning, afternoon and evening. This would be great for train enthusiasts, residents and families. It would add a bit of fun for residents and make the library a bit different to traditional libraries.

**Family space / playgroups / nurseries / pre school groups**

It would be good to see the family space somewhere where parents could take their children to play groups, nurseries or pre school groups. This should support families working in the Council House, New Market Hall, the Derbion, the Derby Made as well as the shops in the different quarters.  It would make all families working in the city centre welcome and have a central space in the Derby made design to allow children to play and learn.

**Everyone Active exercise studio's**

There could also be fitness studio's for exercising throughout the day. They could overlook and have great views of the market place. I personally really enjoyed the classes at LA fitness at Carrington St and the Queens Leisure centre before both centres closed down. The new studio's could be part of everyone active and have classes like stretch and refresh, circuits, and dance classes. This would give residents and workers the chance to do classes during the morning, afternoon and early evening. This would be a great place for exercise or have a bit of fun after work.

**Rolls Royce / Toyota / Alstom / Vaillant / Derby and Derbyshire businesses co-working space**

From a business perspective it would be good to go to Derby and Derbyshire companies to see if they would like space to co-work together. Eg. Rolls Royce, Toyota, Alstom and Vaillant. It would be good to see these companies made to feel very welcome in Derby city centre.

**Additional overflow bike and car parking to support Derby made / the Council House / the New Market Hall / the Quarters**

It would also be good to see bike and car parking available, to again support residents from Derby, Derbyshire, the East Midlands and Staffs working and visiting Derby made. It could also have an overflow parking to support the Council House, the Quad and the New Market Hall.

**An Accessible Market Place for events**

It is really important the Market place is still accessible to local and international events and acts. Eg. the Market place beach, the ice rink, the big wheel and the real ale events as well as international events and acts that have come to support Derby, Derbyshire, the East Midlands and Staffs here in the Market place. These companies and events teams should be made very welcome and it should be accessible and easy to set marquees and power supply in the Market place.  Even though planters, greenery and benches are important it would be great to make them portable, so big events and acts can still set up in the Market place.

**Twining with cities in every UK and European country**

Good to see Exhibitions and galleries added to the Derby made design. Good to see them housed in a cafe. Good to expand and include other UK and European cities twinned to Derby. It would be great to see a city from each UK and European country twinned to Derby. It would also be good to change that every few years and twin with other cities in each UK and European country. This will give other cities the chance to exchange and share ideas, events, galleries, exhibitions and festivals with Derby.

**Vertical flower and greenery gardens to the front and top of the Derby made design**

I am a big fan of the Council house. It looks a great traditional building from the outside. It's very modern on the inside, great idea with the Learning cafe, Riverside Library and other facilities. The Quad is also a great bit of modern architecture. It would be great to see the new Derby made design mix materials like cast iron welded fronts from Derby and Derbyshire colleges, and neon lights to the Market place. It would be great to see similar vertical flower and greenery gardens added to the front and top of the Derby made design.

My name's Natalia Hinton, and today was supposed to mean something—our third wedding anniversary. Three years married to Quinn Madden, and yet here I am, wondering what the hell went wrong.

I'd spent hours in the kitchen, pouring everything I had into making his favorite meal. It wasn't extravagant, just my way of showing I cared, of celebrating us. But when I called Quinn that evening, his line was busy. Again. And again. And again.

By midnight, the food on the table was stone cold, and he still hadn't come home.

A sharp pain twisted in my stomach, stealing my breath. Maybe it was hunger. Maybe it was something else entirely. Clutching my abdomen, I leaned against the counter just as my phone started buzzing.

The ringtone—his ringtone—snapped me out of my haze. I grabbed the phone so quickly I nearly dropped it. ""Quinn? Where are you? Why didn't you answer?"" My voice cracked, a mix of worry and frustration.

His reply was colder than the rain pounding outside. ""Pack your things. Move out for a while.""

For a moment, I couldn't breathe. I clutched the phone tighter, the words hitting me like a slap. ""What... what the hell are you talking about? Did something happen?""

""Diana's back,"" he said flatly. No emotion, no hesitation. ""She doesn't like staying in hotels.""

I froze, my heart sinking like a stone. Diana Terell. Even hearing her name was enough to send a chill through me. I didn't know much about her, but one thing had been painfully clear since day one: my husband had loved her for ten years.

Rain lashed against the windows, loud and unrelenting. The pain in my stomach worsened, but it was nothing compared to the ache spreading through my chest.

""Now?"" I croaked, my voice barely above a whisper. My gaze locked on the storm outside, the lightning illuminating the chaos in my head. ""You're telling me this now? On our—""

""Yes, now,"" he interrupted, his tone sharp and final. He didn't even let me finish. Before I could get the words ""wedding anniversary"" out of my mouth, the line went dead.

I stared at the phone, disbelief coursing through me. The silence that followed was deafening, the kind that wrapped around me and didn't let go.

Once Quinn made up his mind, there was no room for negotiation—never had been.

My hands trembled as I forced myself to stand. The pain in my stomach didn't care about the storm or my emotions. I gulped down a glass of water, hoping it might take the edge off, then pushed through the ache to pack my things.

By the time I zipped the last bag shut, the cab I'd called was already idling at the villa's entrance, its headlights cutting through the rain.

The driver stepped out as I hauled my luggage to the door, his umbrella barely holding back the downpour. ""Miss, are you okay?"" he asked, his brows knit with concern as he reached for my bags.

I gave him a faint smile, brushing off the worry with a small shake of my head. ""I'm fine, really. Just—""

Before I could finish, a sharp, fiery pain tore through my abdomen. It hit me like a sucker punch, and my knees buckled under me. Gasping, I clutched my stomach, my vision blurring as the driver rushed forward, his voice echoing somewhere in the distance.

\*\*\*\*\*

At the hospital, I lay on the stiff bed, an IV drip hooked to my arm, my mind racing but my body feeling too weak to move.

""You're already eleven weeks pregnant,"" the doctor said, her tone professional but edged with concern as she reviewed my test results. ""But you've been pushing yourself too hard. The pain earlier? That was your body giving you a warning.

""If you want to keep this baby, you'll need to be admitted for observation—and take it easy from now on.""

I stared down at my flat abdomen, my mind spinning in chaos.

I'd always been careful, taking birth control pills after every time Quinn and I were together. But two months ago, there'd been that one drunken night. He'd called me to pick him up, and things got heated in the car—just once. And now... a baby.

The doctor's voice pulled me back to reality. ""Where's the baby's father? He should bring you something to eat. You'll need to get some proper nutrition after the IV.""

I opened my mouth to respond, but nothing came out. Instead, I just sat there, silent, my thoughts tangled in knots.

A baby. His baby. What would Quinn say if he knew? Would he care? Would he even want this child?

After the doctor left, I spent what felt like hours staring at my phone, my thumb hovering over his number. Finally, I took a deep breath and dialed. The line connected almost instantly.

""Quinn..."" I started, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Quinn's in the shower,"" a sweet, feminine voice chirped on the other end, casual and light. ""Who's calling? I'll have him call you back.""

It was my first time hearing Diana's voice, but it felt like a dagger straight to the heart. So soon—he'd already brought her home.

""Is that for me?"" Quinn's deep voice came through in the background. A moment later, the phone shuffled, and his familiar indifference came through the line. ""What is it?""

The hospital room felt stiflingly warm, but a cold chill seeped into my bones, leaving me frozen.

""I..."" The words I'd practiced over and over tangled in my throat, refusing to come out. ""I'm pregnant"" felt like a lead weight, too heavy to voice.

I swallowed hard, trying to gather the courage to speak, just as a high-pitched shriek echoed through the line.

""Diana? What happened?"" Quinn's voice, filled with panic, was a tone I'd never heard him use—not for me. Not once in three years.

""I was trying to cut some fruit for you,"" Diana whimpered, her voice trembling. ""And I... I accidentally sliced my finger.""

""Does it hurt? Hold on—I'll take you to the hospital right now!"" His concern was instant, the urgency in his voice cutting deep.

The line went dead before I could respond.

The phone slipped from my trembling hand onto the bed, and I clenched the blanket tightly. My chest felt so constricted it was hard to draw a full breath.

How ironic. Three years of marriage, and I couldn't even get a fraction of the care he'd just shown her.

An hour later, I signed the discharge papers and left the hospital alone, dragging my suitcase behind me. Exhaustion weighed on me as I stepped into the elevator. It stopped on the third floor with a soft ding.

""You didn't have to make such a big deal over something a Band-Aid could handle,"" a woman's playful voice teased just as the doors slid open.

Instinctively, I looked up—and froze.

Standing there was Quinn, and beside him was a petite, gorgeous woman with delicate features and an easy, radiant smile. Her arm was casually looped around his, and her face was lit with happiness. They seemed like the perfect couple.

Even without an introduction, I knew. This was Diana.

The faint smile Quinn had been wearing just seconds ago vanished the moment his gaze met mine. His eyes turned as cold as ice, that familiar indifference creeping back in like a shadow.

""Come on, Quinn!"" Diana stepped into the elevator first, holding the doors open with one hand. Her polite smile flickered my way before she turned her attention back to him. ""Let's go.""

Quinn followed her inside, his sharp gaze narrowing as he glanced at me.

The three of us stood in the elevator, the tension so thick it was suffocating. I felt completely out of place, like an outsider in my own life.

A twisted thought crept into my mind: if Diana knew the truth about my relationship with Quinn, would she still be smiling at me so sweetly?

But I quickly shoved it aside. Even if Quinn didn't love me, I couldn't bear the thought of him hating me any more than he already did.

The ride down felt like an eternity, the silence pressing down on me like a weight. Every second stretched painfully long.

When the doors finally opened on the first floor, I rushed out like a lifeline, desperate to escape, but then I heard Quinn's voice—low and commanding. ""Wait.""

His deep, magnetic voice cut through the air like a whip, stopping me in my tracks. It was devoid of warmth—so different from the tender tone he used with Diana.

Some people, it seems, can only ever love one person. For Quinn, that person was Diana. For me, it had always been Quinn.

""Diana, wait in the car,"" Quinn said, his voice gentle as he handed her the keys. He gave her a soft smile before following me out of the elevator.

As the doors slid shut, I caught the flicker of Diana's face. Her expression shifted—confusion giving way to anger, a flash of irritation sparking in her eyes. She wasn't stupid; she'd figured out who I was.

Quinn's steps quickened as he closed the distance between us, his frown deepening. ""What are you doing at the hospital?"" His voice was ice-cold.

I hesitated, scrambling for an excuse. ""Visiting a friend.""

""With a suitcase? At this hour?"" His words dripped with suspicion, his sharp eyes scanning me like he was waiting to catch me in a lie. Then he sneered, lips curling into a mocking smirk. ""Natalia, your lies are getting worse.""

To him, I was nothing but a schemer, a liar. No matter what I said or did, that was all he'd ever see.

He'd never married me for love—just obligation. The Hinton and Madden families had an old marriage pact, one of those archaic agreements meant to keep power and wealth intertwined.

Three years ago, when my family was on the brink of bankruptcy, I'd swallowed my pride and gone to Alex Madden—Quinn's grandfather—desperately begging him to make good on that deal.

Quinn hadn't wanted any part of it. But when Alex played the family-reputation card, backing him into a corner, he gave in.

And just like that, I became Mrs. Madden. Not a cherished wife, but the roadblock between him and Diana. I'd poured every ounce of my heart into loving him, and he'd repaid me with nothing but resentment.

""Still not telling the truth?"" His face hardened, the disdain in his eyes cutting through me like a knife. ""If you want something, Natalia, just say it. Cut the games.""

So, that's what this was. He'd stopped me because he thought I was scheming, worried I'd somehow mess with his precious Diana.

Quinn... I don't want much. Just your love. Just the chance to keep the baby growing inside me. But deep down, I knew better. That was asking for the impossible.

A lump rose in my throat, and for a long moment, I could only stare at him, fighting the burn behind my eyes. Finally, I found my voice—low, strained, and barely audible. ""I want a divorce.""

# 2.Chapter 2 You're Just A Pawn

Quinn's scowl deepened, and his icy stare pinned me to the spot. ""Natalia, do you have any idea what happens to people who try to threaten me?""

His voice was sharp, dripping with menace, and the anger radiating off him was enough to make my chest tighten.

What the hell was he so mad about? Shouldn't he be happy I was giving him exactly what he wanted? A clean break. A free pass to play house with Diana. Or did he think this was some kind of trick, another one of my so-called schemes?

Swallowing my emotions, I forced a calm expression and met his glare with a faint smile. ""If you're free tomorrow, we can head to the court and get the divorce done.""

I thought I was being reasonable—hell, I was practically bending over backward to make this easy for him. Letting go of a man who would never love me wasn't just for his benefit. It was the only way to protect myself and my baby.

Before I could react, he grabbed my chin with a grip like steel. His fingers bit into my skin, and the look on his face was pure disdain.

""Natalia,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with venomous amusement, ""don't flatter yourself. You're just a pawn your family sold to mine. Whether I keep you around or throw you away—that's my decision. Not yours.""

His words were like a slap, but they shouldn't have surprised me. I knew exactly what he was implying. When we got married, the Madden family had handed over 10 million dollars as an engagement gift to secure a lucrative business deal with the Hintons.

And now? He was reminding me, loud and clear, that without the Maddens, my family's fragile empire would crumble.

Just then, his phone buzzed, cutting through the heavy silence. Diana. It had to be her, impatient and needing his attention.

Quinn's jaw tightened as he glanced at the screen, then back at me. His eyes bore into mine for a long, hard second before he turned on his heel and walked away, leaving me standing there like I didn't even exist.

Outside, the storm was still raging. Rain pounded against the hospital's entrance, lightning flashing across the sky like the universe itself was angry. I stood frozen, staring out into the chaos, unsure of where to go or what to do next.

Slowly, I looked down at my belly, placing a hand over the tiny life growing inside me. I took a deep breath, steadying myself against the storm inside and out.

""Don't worry, baby,"" I whispered, my voice breaking but resolute. ""No matter what, I'll make sure you come into this world safe and sound. That's a promise.""

By the time I finally made it back to my family's house, it was the middle of the night. The place was dead silent, the kind of quiet that pressed against your ears. Everyone was obviously fast asleep.

I eased the door open, doing my best not to make a sound, but it didn't matter. Lucia Brown, the maid who lived on the first floor, must've heard me anyway.

She stepped out of her room, her expression far from friendly, her eyes narrowing as if I were some kind of intruder. ""Ms. Hinton, why are you coming back at this hour?"" she asked, her eyes flicking to my suitcase as she crossed her arms. Her voice carried just the right amount of snark to let me know I wasn't welcome.

Too exhausted to engage, I dropped the suitcase by the door and waved her off. ""Go back to bed. Just move it to my room in the morning,"" I muttered, already heading toward the stairs.

""Wait,"" Lucia called after me, her tone suddenly dripping with false sweetness. ""Ms. Hinton, I almost forgot. Your room got turned into a studio a little while ago—Miss Skylar needed the space.""

Her words hit like a bucket of cold water. My room? Of all the empty ones in this house, she'd taken mine?

Lucia's voice dripped with mock sympathy. ""Oh, don't take it too hard, Ms. Hinton. I mean, you are married, right? Who could've guessed you'd come dragging your suitcase back here in the dead of night?""

She paused, letting the sting sink in before adding, ""If I set up another room for you now, it'd wake Mr. and Mrs. Hinton. How about this—you crash in my room instead?""

I bit back a sneer. She was just a maid, but her audacity spoke volumes—she wouldn't dare act this way without Skylar Hinton giving her the green light.

""No need,"" I replied coolly, turning toward the living room sofa instead.

The storm raged on through the night, its howling winds a perfect backdrop for the whirlwind in my heart. By morning, I was startled awake by my adoptive father, Elijah Hinton's voice, cutting through the haze of exhaustion.

""Natalia, why are you sleeping on the couch?"" His brows furrowed as his sharp gaze shifted to Lucia. ""Why didn't you prepare a room for Ms. Natalia?""

Caught completely off guard, Lucia stammered, tripping over her words as she tried to conjure an excuse.

Before she could manage one, a soft, apologetic voice drifted down the staircase. ""Dad, don't be too hard on Lucia—it's my fault. I turned Natalia's room into a studio for convenience.""

Skylar descended the stairs with that trademark wide-eyed, innocent look she'd perfected. ""Natalia, I didn't mean anything by it. Next time, just give me a heads-up if you're coming back, and you can have my room instead.""

How ironic. The home where I'd grown up now treated me like an outsider, a guest who needed to call ahead.

Forcing a faint smile, I replied evenly, ""Actually, I'll be staying for a while this time. Could you please restore my room right away, Skylar?""

Skylar's saccharine smile faltered for a fraction of a second before she recovered, nodding quickly. ""Of course.""

Elijah's gaze lingered on me, as though he wanted to say something but didn't know how to begin.

I could sense the unspoken questions weighing on him, but now wasn't the time for explanations—not about my pregnancy, and certainly not about the disaster my marriage had become.

Drawing a deep breath, I decided to test the waters. ""Dad, if I want to divorce Quinn... will you support me?""

The words hung in the air, and he froze, his expression shifting from confusion to concern. ""Natalia, what happened?""

I shook my head, unable to share everything just yet. The weight of it all felt too heavy to unload in one conversation.

Instead of pressing, he handed me a glass of water, his voice tinged with guilt. ""Natalia, I know I failed you back then. If life with the Maddens is making you unhappy, just come home. I'll stand by whatever you decide.""

His words, so simple yet heartfelt, brought a flicker of warmth to my chest. At least someone still had my back.

After unpacking my bags, I decided to check in on my adoptive mother, Jenna Hinton. She struggled with chronic insomnia and usually slept late into the morning, so I thought it would be the right time to see her.

The door to her room was slightly ajar, and as I approached, I caught the sound of her agitated voice cutting through the air. ""If we hadn't taken her in, do you think she'd be living the high life as a wealthy socialite today? Divorce? Does she even have a shred of gratitude?""

Elijah sighed heavily. ""Natalia might be adopted, but we've raised her as our daughter for twenty years. If it weren't for her stepping up, negotiating with the Maddens, and marrying Quinn back then, we would've gone bankrupt years ago.""

""Don't give me that!"" Jenna's voice sharpened, laced with grievance. ""Sacrifice? Are you kidding me? Marrying into the Madden family is a golden ticket! Most women would kill for that kind of opportunity.

""And let me remind you, Elijah, Skylar is our real daughter. She was out there suffering for years before we found her last year. She's the one who deserves our love and attention now. We owe it to her to make up for everything she's been through!""

""I know, but it's obvious Natalia's miserable with Quinn—""

""Enough!"" Jenna snapped, her frustration boiling over. ""We can't risk losing the Maddens' support now. We raised Natalia for twenty years—that's more than enough. Consider this her way of paying us back!""

Her words landed like a sucker punch, leaving me momentarily frozen.

I'd always known I was adopted, and I never questioned Jenna and Elijah's love for me. They'd given me everything: a home, an education, a chance to thrive. But Skylar—their real daughter—had been taken from them when she was just three years old.

They'd searched for years before finally reuniting with her last year. Since then, everything had changed.

I didn't blame Jenna for wanting to make up for lost time with Skylar; it was natural for any mother.

But hearing those words—hearing that I was nothing more than a debt to be repaid—crushed me. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath my feet, leaving me stranded.

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I turned and walked away, unspoken hurt pressing down on my chest. I wasn't in the mood to dwell on it any longer, so I headed straight to work at the Madden Group.

The moment I stepped into my office, Raelynn Novak, my secretary, walked in with a cup of coffee. Her hesitation was written all over her face. She'd been with me for years, long before I started working here, and I could tell when she had something to say. ""Ms. Hinton..."" she began, hesitating.

I raised an eyebrow. ""Spit it out, Raelynn. What's going on?""

She set the coffee on my desk carefully, her voice dropping to a near whisper. ""A new design director was appointed this morning. A female director. Mr. Madden hired her himself."" Her tone lingered on the word ""female,"" loaded with implication.

I froze for a second. My stomach tightened as the realization hit. ""Diana Terell, isn't it?"" I asked, my voice steady, though my fingers instinctively clenched the edge of my desk.

Raelynn's eyes widened in surprise. ""Yeah, that's her. You know her? She's got that whole sweet, innocent vibe going on, but let's be real—any woman Mr. Madden hires personally has to be more than just a pretty face, right?""

Quinn, bringing his mistress into the company? Yeah, that sounded exactly like him. And if it was Diana, the lengths he'd go for her made perfect sense. Nobody else could command that kind of attention from him.

My lips curled into a bitter smile. ""Got it. Thanks, Raelynn. Get back to work.""

After a sleepless night and hours buried in paperwork, exhaustion finally hit me like a freight train. I barely managed to pick at my lunch before nausea swept over me, forcing me to rush to the restroom.

My stomach lurched violently, and I clung to the sink, trying to steady myself as dry heaves wracked my body.

""Are you okay?"" a soft voice called out, and a hand stretched toward me, offering a tissue.

I turned, accepting the tissue. But as the words ""Thank you"" hung in my throat, my gaze collided with Diana's delicate face. There she stood, her doe eyes wide and innocent, her expression as fragile as a blooming flower, as if she couldn't hurt a soul.

# 3.Chapter 3 A Bitter Irony

Diana spotted me the moment I walked in. Her sharp eyes gleamed with a predatory glint, and a sly, almost smug smile played on her lips as she gave me a slow, deliberate once-over, like she was weighing her competition.

""I'm Diana Terell. We met at the hospital last night,"" she said, her voice sugar-sweet but dripping with something sharper, more calculated.

""Yeah."" I barely spared her a glance, responding with a nonchalant hum while fixing my hair in the mirror.

She kept the small talk going, her tone light and conversational, but I wasn't biting.

Whatever game she was playing, I had zero interest in entertaining it. Raelynn was right—this woman was trouble, through and through.

When Quinn and I got married, he'd sent Diana off to study abroad. Back then, she'd had no choice but to accept that the man she loved had married someone else.

And now here she was, sauntering back in as if nothing had changed, like she still owned a stake in his life.

She was bold, I'd give her that. Brazen enough to waltz in as the other woman without a shred of shame. It was almost admirable—thick skin like hers didn't come easy.

I threw her a bored look, turned on my heel, and made my way toward the door. There was no way I was wasting any more of my time on her.

But just as my hand reached for the door handle, she dropped her bomb. ""I'm pregnant,"" she said, her voice smug, practically daring me to react. ""It's Quinn's baby.""

My steps faltered, my heart plummeting like a stone. Slowly, I turned back to face her. Gone was the syrupy, innocent act she'd been putting on. Her expression was cold, triumphant, her true colors showing in stark contrast.

""You've had your fun playing Mrs. Madden for two years, Natalia,"" she said, venom dripping from every word. ""But now that I'm back, I'm taking what's mine.""

For a moment, I was stunned into silence by the sheer audacity of her words. Then I laughed—a sharp, bitter sound that echoed through the restroom like a slap.

Diana had landed just last night, fresh off a plane from her overseas studies. If she really was pregnant, it meant Quinn had never actually cut ties with her. The timeline lined up all too perfectly with his last trip abroad two months ago.

The irony wasn't lost on me: we were both carrying Quinn's child.

I crossed my arms and arched a brow, my voice as cold as ice. ""Miss Terell, judging by your tone, you seem confused about your standing here. That baby you're flaunting? Let's call it what it is—a bastard.""

Her composure cracked instantly, her face twisting with rage as she jabbed a finger toward me. ""Who are you calling a mistress?"" she snapped, her voice shaking with fury. ""Natalia, if you hadn't barged into Quinn's life, he would've married me! I was supposed to be Mrs. Madden—you stole that from me!""

I didn't flinch. Instead, I let my gaze stay steady, cool, and cutting. ""You really think that if I weren't in the picture, Quinn would've married you?"" I said, my tone sharp enough to slice. ""Let's get real, Diana. You think Alex Madden would let the daughter of a maid into his family?

""Especially when that maid's sitting in prison for theft?""

Her face went pale, her jaw tightening as the words hit their mark. I'd done my homework. Back when I still thought my love for Quinn meant something, I'd dug into the lives of everyone close to him. And Diana's dirty laundry wasn't hard to find.

Her mother, Julia Terell, had worked as a maid for the Maddens for over two decades. After Quinn's mother passed, Julia had practically raised him. Diana had grown up in the Madden household, always lurking in the shadows, never truly belonging.

But five years ago, Julia's greed got the best of her. She stole a priceless family heirloom and ended up with a ten-year prison sentence. She was still locked up.

Diana's eyes reddened with anger, her mask of innocence shattering. ""You bitch!"" she shrieked, lunging at me with her hand raised to slap me.

I wasn't about to let her land a hit. Dodging to the side, I avoided her swing, but Diana wasn't done. She pivoted sharply, her next move wild and unpredictable. This time, she charged straight for my stomach.

Panic surged through me. My only thought was to protect my baby. Instinctively, I threw my arms around my belly and shoved her away with all the strength I could muster.

A piercing scream tore through the air as Diana collapsed onto the floor. ""My baby... my baby!"" she wailed, clutching her abdomen.

Scarlet blood spread beneath her, pooling on the polished floor. Her cries echoed through the office, drawing a crowd of horrified onlookers. Two of my female colleagues rushed in, their eyes wide with horror as they gasped at the sight.

Moments later, Quinn stormed through the door, his face dark as a brewing storm. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees and scooped Diana into his arms.

""Quinn... save our baby,"" Diana whimpered, her voice trembling, her pale face streaked with sweat—a picture of pure vulnerability.

""Don't panic, the ambulance is on its way,"" he murmured, his tone low but laced with tension. Every fiber of his being seemed focused on her, his concern etched into his furrowed brow.

Then, his head snapped up, and his gaze locked on me. The fury in his eyes was blistering, like he was barely holding himself back from tearing into me.

I froze under his glare, my stomach twisting in knots. Words clawed at my throat, desperate to come out, but I couldn't find anything to say.

What would it matter? I could already see the judgment in his eyes—he'd made up his mind about what happened. He wouldn't believe me.

The ambulance arrived quickly, the medics moving Diana onto a stretcher as she whimpered softly, milking every ounce of sympathy from the moment. Quinn followed right behind, not sparing me a single glance.

Left alone in the silence of the office, I could feel the weight of every whisper, every stare. In the blink of an eye, I had become the office joke, the subject of everyone's whispered gossip and behind-the-back glances.

I couldn't stand it any longer. The stares, the judgment—it was too much. Grabbing my things, I slipped out early, swallowing the lump of humiliation in my throat as I headed home.

The moment I stepped through the door, my adoptive father called me into his study, his face lined with worry.

""Natalia, there's trouble at the company. Can you lend me a million dollars?"" His voice was strained, teetering on the edge of desperation.

I forced a bitter smile. ""I don't have that kind of money."" The Madden family's engagement gift—what little financial security I'd ever had—had already been poured into covering my family's debts. There was nothing left.

""Could you talk to Quinn?"" Elijah's plea was heavy with urgency. ""A worker died on one of the construction sites, and the compensation has to be paid immediately. If we don't settle it soon, the situation could spiral. Natalia, I'm begging you. Please, help us get through this.""

The weight of his plea pressed heavily on me. No matter how strained things were between us, Elijah had always been my father in every sense that mattered. I sighed and nodded reluctantly. ""I'll try.""

But Quinn? I knew asking him was a long shot. After what happened at the office, there was no way he'd agree to help me.

After mulling it over, I decided to head to the Madden Mansion instead. If anyone could help, it was Alex.

As his granddaughter-in-law, shameless as it felt, I might still have enough standing to appeal to his sense of family.

When I arrived, the butler greeted me politely and ushered me into the grand living room.

To my surprise, Quinn was there, lounging on the sleek black leather sofa in a crisp white shirt, the top button undone, exposing just enough of his collarbone to look both casual and commanding.

I blinked, startled. I'd expected him to still be at the hospital with Diana, holding her hand or playing the doting boyfriend. Yet here he was, calm and composed, as if nothing had happened.

""Natalia, you're finally here,"" Alex greeted warmly, his kind eyes crinkling as he smiled. ""Quinn mentioned you two are planning for a baby. That's wonderful news! But look at you—you're too thin. You'll need to eat more from now on to keep yourself and the baby healthy.""

Quinn told him that? My mind scrambled. And how did Alex know I'd be coming today?

I glanced at Quinn, searching for answers. His brown eyes met mine, sharp and calculating. Whatever game he was playing, I couldn't read it.

""Serve the dishes,"" Quinn instructed the staff, his voice calm but commanding.

The meal was extravagant, and Alex, clearly determined to fatten me up, insisted I drink two bowls of soup to ""nourish"" myself.

After the meal, Alex kept me engaged in a conversation about family matters. I tried to bring up the money issue several times, but the conversation never naturally found its way there.

By the time the clock struck eight, I hadn't found an opening.

""Grandpa, it's getting late. We should head home,"" Quinn said, rising from his seat and making the first move to leave. I followed suit, offering Alex a polite nod before turning toward the door.

The ride home was drenched in an awkward, suffocating silence. The air between us was heavy, thick with unspoken tension. Quinn's grip on the wheel was tight, his jaw clenched, and his expression colder than a January frost.

Unable to take it any longer, I finally broke the silence. ""How's Diana?"" My voice was quiet, hesitant. I wasn't trying to stir the pot—I just needed to know. What happened to her wasn't my fault. I hadn't meant to hurt her or the baby. It was self-defense.

Quinn's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. Without warning, he slammed on the brakes. The car jerked to a violent stop in the middle of the road, tires screeching.

The sudden jolt sent me lurching forward, my arms flying up instinctively to shield my stomach.

Before I could recover, his hand shot out, grabbing my collar and pinning me back against the seat with a force that left me breathless.

""Don't you dare say her name,"" he growled, his voice low and menacing, each word dripping with warning. His eyes locked onto mine, dark and turbulent, like a storm on the verge of breaking.

My chest tightened, a knot of humiliation and heartache tightening around my ribs. The pain was almost too much to bear.

I forced a bitter laugh, trying to mask the sting. ""If she means that much to you, why aren't you with her right now? Or are you afraid I'll go running to your grandfather?"" I glanced at him with a smirk. ""Seems like maybe she's not as irreplaceable as you think.""

But my taunt didn't seem to get to him. Whether I'd hit a nerve or he just didn't give a damn anymore, Quinn's face remained a mask of indifference. His grip loosened, and without a word, he released me and resumed driving.

When we pulled up to the villa, Quinn got out of the car without a word, heading straight inside, not even sparing me a glance. I hesitated for a brief moment before reluctantly following him inside.

Back at the villa, everything felt oddly unchanged. The familiar scent of lavender lingered in the air, and everything was just as it had been—intact, untouched—no sign that Diana had ever been here.

For a moment, a foolish hope flickered inside me, like a tiny spark. Maybe, just maybe, Quinn hadn't brought Diana here.

Lost in thought, I didn't notice Quinn until the bathroom door opened. He stepped out, freshly showered, the white bathrobe hanging loosely around him.

It barely concealed his chiseled chest and the taut muscles of his body, every inch of him radiating raw masculinity.

Quinn caught me staring and frowned slightly. ""Need me to help you shower?""",1,1750850380.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1lk2zux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1lk2zux/when_i_drink_i_turn_gay/,"When I Drink, I Turn Gay","Okay Reddit, this is gonna sound like the biggest “bro what” moment of my life, but hear me out.

I (18M) have always considered myself straight. Like, painfully straight. I played football, dated girls, watched action movies, and all that basic straight dude stuff. My friends always joked that I was a ""Chad in denial"" because I was a little too comfortable being touchy with the boys, but I just laughed it off. Nothing ever happened... until this one night.

It was Jake’s (19M) birthday party. Jake’s been my best friend since forever—like we used to build LEGO cities and try to microwave pizza rolls at age 10. He’s always been openly bi, super chill about it, and honestly I never thought much of it. He flirted with guys and girls equally, and he never made it weird with me.

Anyway. The party.

I hadn’t really drunk before—like, not more than a beer or two. But Jake’s older brother brought tequila. Real, evil, betrayal-in-a-bottle tequila. And I decided to be “cool” for once and keep up with everyone. By shot 4, I was laughing too hard at dumb TikToks, calling everyone “bro” or “king,” and then it happened.

Jake sat next to me on the couch, gave me this smirk, and said, “You always get flirty when you’re drunk.” I jokingly nudged him and said, “What if I flirted back though?” He just raised an eyebrow like he was calling my bluff.

Next thing I know, I’m full-on sitting on his lap. Like, what?? WHO AM I? Everyone else was too busy singing karaoke to notice, but I looked him in the eyes and said, “Why are your eyelashes so long? That’s illegal.”

And then... I kissed him.

It wasn’t a small kiss. It was a movie-scene, time-freezes kind of kiss. He kissed back. No hesitation.

After a few seconds, I pulled back and went, “Dude. I think the tequila made me gay.”

He just laughed and said, “Nah, bro. That was already in you. Tequila just turned off the filter.”

The next morning, I woke up on the couch with the biggest hangover and a massive wave of “What the hell did I do last night?” crashing over me. Jake handed me a coffee and said, “Still gay, or was it just the tequila?”

I didn’t even know how to answer. I’ve been thinking about it every day since.

We haven’t talked about it deeply—yet. But there’s definitely something there. Like, I catch myself staring at him for no reason. I get butterflies when he smiles. And when we play video games and he casually leans on me, I don’t want him to move.

So now I’m asking: Reddit, what do I do? Was that a drunken moment or did I just unlock something real? Am I bi? Am I in love with my best friend? Help me out.

TL;DR: Got drunk at my best friend's party, ended up kissing him. Now questioning everything",1,1750850379.0,Coachella,8,0.56,False

1lk2ykb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Good-Week-6698/comments/1lk2ykb/top_7_restaurant_furniture_manufacturers_in_india/,Top 7 Restaurant Furniture Manufacturers in India,"If you’ve ever tried furnishing a restaurant from scratch, you’ll know one thing for sure – finding the *right* furniture partner makes all the difference. Whether it’s a cozy 20-seater café or a grand 1,000-seater brewery, the vibe starts with the furniture.

After weeks of research (and lots of coffee), I put together a list of the top 7 restaurant furniture manufacturers in India. And trust me, this isn’t just another list – this is based on real project work, product range, and overall reliability.

Let’s dive into it. And yes, if you’re looking for a dependable recommendation – I’ve got a clear favorite!

# 1. Best of Exports  

I have to start with Best of Exports, and for good reason. Out of all the manufacturers I looked into, this one consistently stood out – not just in terms of furniture quality, but the scale of work, customization options, and reliability.

They’ve completed over 1500+ projects across India, working with everything from boutique cafés to sprawling breweries. What really impressed me is their ability to blend functionality with aesthetics. You’ll find:

* **Restaurant Chairs** that are both stylish and sturdy
* **Tables** that suit everything from fine dining to casual eateries
* **Booths** that make your layout more private and customer-friendly
* **Restaurant Sofas** for a plush, luxurious feel
* And yes, even **Outdoor Furniture** that actually lasts

They operate out of a **1.15 lakh sq. ft. facility**, with a team of over 90 skilled employees – and you can feel that experience in their final output. Everything’s crafted with attention to detail, and they’re used to working with restaurants of all shapes and sizes.

Honestly, if you’re setting up a new place or revamping your existing space, this is the team I’d trust with my project.

# 2. Binsha Furniture

Another notable name on the list is Binsha Furniture. They’re known for their craftsmanship and traditional styles with a modern twist. Their furniture often features in classic-style restaurants, and they offer a decent range of customizable options.

# 3. Indian Furniture Company

This brand has a strong portfolio, especially when it comes to solid wood restaurant furniture. They specialize in elegant, rustic-style pieces that work well in cafes, bistros, and themed eateries. I found them particularly good with wooden finishes and timeless designs.

# 4. Sunny Overseas

If you’re into handcrafted and export-quality furniture, Sunny Overseas is worth checking out. They blend traditional Indian artistry with global standards, offering a mix of contemporary and antique looks. Great for high-end restaurants or concept-driven spaces.

# 5. Gharnish

Gharnish is ideal for restaurant owners who want modern, minimalist designs. Their collections are clean, functional, and often geared toward urban spaces. Think metro city cafes and chic lounges. They also offer good after-sales support.

# 6. Jodhpur Crafts Furniture

As the name suggests, this company taps into the rich woodworking heritage of Jodhpur. Their restaurant furniture often includes intricate carving and heritage designs – perfect if you want a royal or ethnic theme in your restaurant.

# 7. Superior Seating

Superior Seating brings a more international vibe to the table. Their pieces are sleek, ergonomic, and usually preferred by upscale dining spots or quick-service restaurants that value comfort and durability in equal measure.

# Final Thoughts – Choosing the Right Partner

Choosing the right restaurant furniture manufacturer isn’t just about price or looks – it’s about getting a partner who understands your space, your brand, and your customers. While there are plenty of good options in India, Best of Exports truly checks all the boxes when it comes to quality, scale, and service.

Whether you're starting small or going big, I’d recommend starting your search there. After all, great food tastes even better when served in the right setting.",1,1750850261.0,u_Good-Week-6698,0,1.0,False
1lk2y3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lk2y3h/aitah_for_reacting_to_what_people_are_saying/,AITAH for reacting to what people are saying?,"So some months ago i was hospitalised for a mental breakdown and I went back home to recoup I took some meds and started recovering.

I told someone that I considered a friend from a previous job that is very close where I live what happened with leaving out all the details.

Suddenly whenever I passed outside of there and talk to people they would be on the verge of crying or looking at me like I was some sort of alien 

I explained that it wasn’t something to worry about but the gates of relentless gossip and nosiness where opened 

People made it their job to assume and to throw comments left and right basically to provoke me to tell them anything

Then it was in another shop the same close by that I used to work the same.
Then I went to work to a different cafe 10 minutes from this area by foot.

People that I hadn’t seen again in my life I started working there and suddenly after some days they started throwing words like crazy,madhouse that they too are seeing a psychologist and began saying to me things that I had discussed with coworkers almost a year ago very personal stuff that I had discussed with some people that I worked with for 2 years 
Even how I drink my coffee what women I like what injuries I had or passed medical run ins not mental ones child hood trauma or even my eating habits.

They started selectively saying things for them selves for me to “open up” and that everybody has problems :) with a creepy smile always but I never said anything 

Whenever I confronted them they would play crazy because they knew that it’s a very lowly thing to do but they continued regardless like canibals 

My best friend and a psychologist told me to get out of such environment because those are people unhinged and detached people that they don’t actually have any idea what they are doing but I stayed for some weeks more thinking that this would subside

So i am very good at what I do and a professional in a wide field In hospitality and some younger guys that are delivery boys where monkeying around being a nuisance and I basically told them to cut it out because they where distracting us and annoyed the costumers and they started saying things like “yo start saying this it drives him crazy haha”


The management knew this was shity and what was going on but they had also part taken previously in these comments and they told me with the most hypocritical way “you shouldn’t worry what other people say and you shouldn’t get offended so easily nobody openly mocks you :)”

These where enough spike my anxiety and cause me again to seek sleeping aid 

 I was feeling drained constantly from the mental stress that this was causing me, people knowing so much about my life but being total strangers to me believing that they even had a right to even refer them to me or to ask me questions nonchalantly about my personal life that otherwise they could ever ask or words being thrown around to just confirm gossip that they had heard

Mind you this woman the manager was seeing a psychologist and she was that queen of it all and the first one to start mentioning those things

And whenever someone wasn’t around infront of her but I was she would mostly speak shit for anybody else for example like “yeah that girl Sarah I never liked her she was a bits and a whore” but when she was in front she would be like “hi Sarah how are you I hope you are doing good :)”

So I just had enough and asked to leave but I should have done it sooner but when I did they asked me to stay with immediately starting saying that “we don’t need anybody and they have people that can bring them in anytime :)”

Whenever I confronted them about these things they flaked and said it was nothing but most of the people there where doing it also to each other constantly talking shit behind anyone that wasn’t there 
to tell you the truth it felt to me more of a madhouse there than the psychiatric clinic that I stayed for 5 days 

Was I overreacting and AITA?

We immediately felt like soulmates, just perfectly compatible. Our first run was about 1 year and I still remember it as one of the happiest years of my life. We just connected emotionally, physically and could have fun together. We never got into any fights, only ever complaining if we couldn't see each other often enough.

She had always battled chronic migraines since her teenage years and she called it lucky that during our first relationship year it didn't cause her much issues but one day her illness returned. At that time I didn't realize the extent of health issues and projected most of what follows on my self, my actions or our relationship.

She slowly withdrew from me and became silent, first saying that she's just out of order for a few days, but later requesting more time and space to deal with things. She didn't call it a relationship issue and wouldn't tell me what other ""things"" were troubling her. Of course I panicked and tried to keep her close to me, only pushing her further away. In the end she broke up with me while I was begging her to tell me what went wrong or how we could fix things.

A few weeks after breakup I came over to exchange some belongs. We ended up in bed that night, feverishly kissing. I asked her if that means she still loves me and her answer was ""yes, but I can't be with you because I'm a 5000 year-old Maya princess trapped in the body of a modern woman"". And I swear, to me it looked like her eye color changed from green to purple in that moment. While the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, I try to judge if she would snap out of it soon; my only explanation at that time was that she said something absurd just to get me off her case.  
  
Two years, no answers. 

I try to move on, found another girl who treats me nicely, but I'm only half-in emotionally.  
  
Then my old love and I randomly meet in the city one day, she seems different, we drink coffee and have a really nice conversation and immediately connect again on an emotional level. She invites me over to continue the coffee date at her place. We talk about the happy past, feverishly kiss, end up in bed and suddenly the doorbell rings. It's a man calling himself her boyfriend and he's quite furious that I, a stranger, is paying a surprise visit. I excuse myself trying to leave with ""I'm sorry, I didn't know I was intruding, we're just friends from the past, I'll leave you two to it."" But she interrupts and sends this other guy home telling him to get bent and that he wasn't invited. I ask her why she's having another relationship if she's obviously still attached to me. She tells me that it's not her boyfriend and that only he thinks it's a relationship because she let him a little too close. To me it sounds like we are getting back together, so I break up with my current relationship.

Three years, no answers. 

We didn't get back together, she just stonewalled me. In the meantime I tried getting over her by dating other women casually, but I never felt emotionally invested again. I still can't get her out of my head though for all the good times we had.

I finally seem to move on and find a woman who I manage to stay with for 8 years. It's cozy, no stress, no fights, but also no excitement, no passion. I love her for the way we are best friends, we share hobbies and we live together harmoniously, but it's not the same intimate connection I felt with the love of my life. I decide to ask her to become my wife, buy a house and settle. She says yes, but I realize how I just escalated all of the underlying incompatibilities and our relationship starts to crumble before we pull it off.

All of the years I've been secretly messaging my first love. Some years she wouldn't reply at all, sometimes we would catch up. She mostly tells me that her health is bad but then 3 years ago, it's a different kind of conversion. About how she's moved to another country, had multiple abusive boyfriends and is now stuck in a toxic relationship and how I am trying to find this one romantic love again. We start writing each other regularly, at least every week, building like a pen-pal friendship.

Two years, 32,000 words later.

She finally manages to break out of her toxic relationship and moves back to our home town. I decide to cancel all future plans with my current partner.

We slowly start going on dates, just a walk, just a coffee downtown. And immediately we fall head over heels in love again, basically trying to hold ourselves back but screaming inside. On Valentine's day this year we officially got back together. It was the same romantic, overly passionate feeling as our first ever meeting. The following weeks are pure bliss. We notice how we both changed and grew up, but we somehow align even more than in the past. She finally reveals to me what was even going on: after our first year, her chronic illness returned, rendering her basically unable to live a life. She had to drop out of university back then, trying to return multiple times, but failed due to her health. Now she's unable to work full-time and receives financial aid. She knew this was coming and didn't want me to suffer through it, basically saying she didn't want to drag me down into her ""shit"" life, because I deserve better. I believe her and we make up for everything, discussing issues of our troubled lives and connect deeper than we ever have. For some reason even our intimacy and other activities gets even better than before.

6 weeks later, ghosted.

I don't know what's going on, everything was perfect, but I read an E-Mail saying ""I got a phone call, need a break."" I don't know how long or what's it about. This time I don't look at myself, I know it's not about me. I'm an okay-looking guy, I have a well-paying job, I have supportive friends and family, I'm a pretty nice person and we've been hitting it off in bed very well, so there's nothing I can think of that would rob us of a future, well except her illness.

3 weeks later, we're fine again.

She returns with a deep-dive explanation about how she's still haunted by her abusive relationship and it was still poisoning her life. She needed to work through it to understand her own emotions, but now she's fully committed and knows that nothing could ever disrupt her feelings for me. I think I've lost my mind long ago, but I just love her like I've never loved anyone else. And so we have another 8 weeks of a great time. We make plans of moving in together. She writes me love poems, I write her love songs on guitar. We go see our favorite bands at the festival. 

But one day, her migraines return. First, it's her upset stomach and I understand she might be embarrassed and doesn't want to see me. Then it's her headaches, rendering her unable to get out of bet. I understand, I'm trying to be supportive, but she says, there's nothing I can do to help and she can't see me. I keep checking in or her, she tells me how her job and dogs are stressing her out to the point of feeling like burnout. I offer sympathy and unconditional support like walking the dogs, doing some shopping, but she blocks it all off. I'm trying to be all mature about it, sending only one message each day or every second day, checking in, telling her about how I'm holding up, no hard feelings etc. Her last reply was ""Feeling burned out.""

Now it's been a week since I've heard from her. I've messaged her that I'll support her no matter what and that there's nothing she needs to do if she's not ready, but any little sign would cheer me up. She then removed her account from our shared calendar app. I asked her mother what's going on and she just told me ""I also don't know but she's physically ok"".

**TL;DR**

I've been in love with a woman for 13 years. When times are good, we seem to have a perfect relationship, but every time her health (migraines and potentially other issues) disrupt her life, prompting her to stonewall and ghost me. She always comes back and we tell each other how we're the love our lives, but the same thing keeps happening again and it's breaking me.

**How do I cope with this dynamic or break out of it?** My heart is all-in, ready to burn my life for this person, but my brain tells me, that I'm not getting anywhere. On the one hand, I want to support her, still hoping that she finds a way to treat her issues and have the capacity for a relationship and on the other hand I would like to work on myself to make me less anxiously attached, just less affected.

I don't want to (or can't) simply break up and move on with a different woman. I need to either fix our relationship to be more healthy or fix myself to not be dragged down by it. If I manage the latter, it would probably enable me to go on like this, but more likely it would make me realize that I could just move on to something healthier.

1lk2vys,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1lk2vys/10_prompts_for_solopreneurs_with_frameworks_that/,10 prompts for solopreneurs (with frameworks that actually work),"I've been obsessively testing and refining AI prompts that go beyond the usual “write me a blog post” stuff. These are serious prompts designed to create actual business assets; things like productized services, high-converting sales scripts, scalable workflows, and even mindset breakthroughs.

The real benefit comes from combining a clear role, a smart framework, and a strong objective. Every prompt here is built on a battle-tested mental model from business, psychology, or systems design and I’ve included the framework for each one so you can understand why it works and become better at prompting yourself .

These are the 10 best prompts I’ve used, all copy-paste ready. Save them, use them, and let me know what results you got.

**1. The ""Signature Service"" Design Framework: Chain of Thought + Productization**

**Framework Used:** **CoT (Chain of Thought) + Productization.** Chain of Thought prompts the AI to ""think step-by-step,"" breaking a complex problem into a logical sequence. Productization is the business concept of turning a service into a standardized, scalable product.

**Why it's powerful:** This prompt stops you from selling your time (e.g., ""blog post writing"") and starts you selling a high-value, productized system (e.g., ""The SEO Authority Engine""). This is the single fastest way to 5x your freelance income.

**Prompt:**

    Act as a high-ticket business consultant. My current service is [Generic Service, e.g., 'writing social media posts']. I want to transform this into a premium ""Signature Service"" that I can charge [Target Price, e.g., '$3,000/mo'] for.
    
    Think step-by-step to design this service:
    1.  Give it a compelling, branded name: (e.g., ""The Viral Content Engine"").
    2.  Define the specific, transformational outcome for the client:** What is their ""dream result""?
    3.  Break it down into 3-5 unique pillars or phases: (e.g., Pillar 1: Audience & Competitor Analysis, Pillar 2: High-Impact Content Creation, Pillar 3: Multi-Platform Distribution & Engagement).
    4.  List the specific, tangible deliverables for each pillar.
    5.  Suggest a unique process or proprietary method** that makes my service different from what anyone else offers.

**2. The Niche Authority Affiliate Review Article Framework: CO-STAR**

**Framework Used:** **CO-STAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response).** This framework provides the AI with a comprehensive creative brief, ensuring all aspects of the output are perfectly aligned with the strategic goal.

**Why it's powerful:** This creates a perfectly structured, SEO-optimized ""money post"" that's designed to build trust and convert readers. It forces the AI to focus on user benefits, not just product features, which is the key to high conversion rates.

**Prompt:**

    Act as a world-class SEO copywriter and expert in the [Your Niche, e.g., 'home coffee brewing'] niche.
     
    Context: You are writing for a blog that helps beginners make informed buying decisions.
    
    Objective: To persuade the reader to purchase the [Product Name, e.g., 'Breville Barista Express'] through an affiliate link by providing immense value.
    
    Style: Expert, yet approachable and engaging.
    
    Tone: Honest and trustworthy, not overly ""salesy.""
    
    Audience: Beginners in the niche who are considering a significant purchase.
    
    Response Structure:
    1.  Catchy, SEO-Optimized Title: Include ""Review,"" ""Is It Worth It,"" and the current year.
    2.  Introduction: Hook the reader by addressing their core problem/desire and state the final verdict upfront.
    3.  Core Features Deep Dive: Explain the 5 most important features and, crucially, the benefit of each feature for the user.
    4.  Pros and Cons Table: A scannable, honest breakdown.
    5.  ""Who is this product FOR?"" (And who it's NOT for).
    6.  Comparison: Briefly compare it to one major competitor.
    7.  Conclusion & Final Recommendation: A strong call-to-action (CTA).

**3. The ""Value Ladder"" Architect Framework: Strategic Business Modeling**

**Framework Used:** **Strategic Business Modeling.** Based on a classic marketing concept popularized by Russell Brunson, this prompt guides the AI to map a customer's entire journey, from low-cost entry to high-ticket purchase.

**Why it's powerful:** A single product is not a business. This prompt helps you design a complete product ecosystem that maximizes customer lifetime value and builds a sustainable, scalable business.

Prompt:

    Act as a business model strategist. 
    
    My expertise is in [Your Skill, e.g., 'Notion productivity']. 
    Design a ""Value Ladder"" for my business. 
    
    Map out a 4-step ladder that guides a customer on their journey with me: 
    - Lead Magnet (Free) 
    - Tripwire Offer ($7–$47) 
    - Core Offer ($197–$497) 
    - High-Ticket Offer ($1,500+)

**4. The AI-Powered Productized Service Blueprint Framework: SOP Design + Systems Thinking**

**Framework Used:** **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Design + Systems Thinking.** This prompt tasks the AI with creating a detailed, step-by-step workflow, treating a business process like an assembly line where AI tools are the automated machinery.

**Why it's powerful:** This designs a scalable service where AI does 80% of the work. This allows you to offer a high-value service at a competitive price while maintaining massive profit margins. It's the blueprint for a modern, AI-leveraged business.

Prompt:

    I want to sell a productized service called ""[Service Name, e.g., 'Podcast Repurposer Pro']"" for [Price, e.g., '$299/episode']. The service turns one podcast episode into multiple content assets.
    
    Design the complete AI-assisted workflow for this service:
    1.  Client Input: What does the client provide? (e.g., an mp3 file).
    2.  The AI Workflow (Step-by-Step):
           Step 1: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Whisper AI'] for transcription.
           Step 2: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Claude 3'] with a specific prompt to extract 5 key takeaways and a summary.
           Step 3: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'ChatGPT-4'] with a prompt to write 3 Twitter threads based on the takeaways.
           Step 4: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Canva AI'] to create 5 quote cards.
    3.  Human Review: Where is the crucial human touchpoint for quality control and strategic polish before delivery?

**5. The ""Blue Ocean"" Strategy Canvas Framework: Blue Ocean Strategy**

**Framework Used:** **Blue Ocean Strategy (from W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne).** This is a world-renowned business strategy framework for creating new market space (""Blue Oceans"") and making competition irrelevant.

**Why it's powerful:** Instead of trying to outperform rivals in a bloody ""red ocean,"" this prompt uses a famous framework to help you invent a new market. It's for creating a business that has no direct competition.

**Prompt**

    Act as a business strategist trained in Blue Ocean Strategy. I am in the crowded [Your Industry, e.g., 'project management software'] industry.
    
    Help me find a new market space using the ""Four Actions Framework"":
    1.  List Key Factors: What are the 6-8 factors that companies in my industry currently compete on?
    2.  Eliminate: Which of these factors that the industry takes for granted can we completely eliminate?
    3.  Reduce: Which can be reduced well below the industry standard?
    4.  Raise: Which can be raised well above the industry standard?
    5.  Create: What new factors can we introduce that the industry has never offered?
    
    Based on your answers, propose a new, innovative product concept for a currently underserved customer.

**6. The VSL (Video Sales Letter) Script Generator**

**Framework Used:** **Direct-Response Copywriting Structure.** This prompt follows a classic, psychologically-driven sales script formula proven to hold attention and drive conversions in video format.

**Why it's powerful:** VSLs are one of the highest-converting sales assets online. This prompt provides a proven script structure that takes a viewer from casual interest to a strong desire to buy. It's a money-printing machine if done right.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a direct-response video scriptwriter. Write a complete 10-minute VSL script to sell my [Product/Course, e.g., 'Side Hustle Launchpad' course]. The video will be voiceover on top of simple text slides.  
    
    Follow this structure precisely: 
    1.  The Hook (0-30s): A bold, pattern-interrupting question or statement. 
    2.  Problem & Agitation (30s-2m): Detail the audience's pain. 
    3.  Introduce the ""New Opportunity"" (2m-3m): Hint at the solution without revealing the product. 
    4.  Backstory & Discovery (3m-5m): Your story of finding this solution. 
    5.  The Solution Reveal (5m-7m): Introduce your product by name. 
    6.  The Offer Stack (7m-9m): List every deliverable, bonus, and guarantee to build overwhelming value. 
    7.  The Urgent CTA (9m-10m): A clear call to action with scarcity or urgency.

# 7. The ""Voice of Customer"" Data Miner

**Framework Used:** **APE (Action, Purpose, Expectation).** This direct prompting framework is ideal for specific data analysis tasks. We are telling the AI exactly what to do, why it's doing it, and what the final output should look like.

**Why it's powerful:** The best marketing copy uses the customer's exact words. This prompt turns the AI into a research analyst that can sift through reviews or comments to pull out the exact pain points and ""golden phrases"" you should be using in your ads and sales pages.

**The Prompt:**

    Action: Analyze the following set of [source, e.g., 'Amazon reviews for a competing product']. 
    Purpose: To extract the ""Voice of Customer."" I want their exact pain points, desires, and language to use in my marketing. 
    Expectation: 
    1.  List the top 5 recurring Pain Points mentioned. 
    2.  List the top 5 Desired Outcomes they talk about. 
    3.  Extract 10-15 ""golden phrases"" – direct, emotionally charged quotes. 
    4.  Summarize the overall customer sentiment in one paragraph.  
    
    [Paste your raw data here.]

# 8. The ""Economic Moat"" Audit

**Framework Used:** **Value Investing Principles (from Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger).** This prompt applies the mental models of the world's best investors to your own business, forcing a focus on long-term defensibility.

**Why it's powerful:** A profitable business is good; a defensible business is valuable. This prompt forces you to analyze how protected your business is from competition. A strong moat is what allows for long-term, sustainable profits.

**The Prompt:**

    Role: A value investor and business analyst. 
    
    Task: Audit my business, [Business Description], to assess the strength of its economic moat.  Analyze my business against the four primary types of economic moats. Provide a score of 1-5 for each and a suggestion for how to widen that moat. 
    1.  Intangible Assets: (Brand, IP) 
    2.  Switching Costs: (How hard is it for customers to leave?) 
    3.  Network Effects: (Does the service get better with more users?) 
    4.  Cost Advantages: (Can I operate cheaper than rivals?)  
    
    Provide an overall summary of my business's long-term defensibility.

# 9. The High-Converting Freelance Service Page Copy

**Framework Used:** CoT (Chain of Thought) + Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) Copywriting. The prompt's step-by-step nature guides the AI through a logical flow, mirroring the classic PAS formula to create persuasive, client-centric copy.

**Why it's powerful:** Most freelancers list their skills. This prompt forces the AI to write a page that focuses entirely on the client's pain and desired outcome, which is infinitely more persuasive. It's designed to generate leads, not just inform.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write the copy for the service page of a [Your Service, e.g., 'Webflow Developer']. 
    
    The audience is non-technical small business owners who are overwhelmed and need a website that gets them clients.  
    
    Think step-by-step: 
    1.  Start with a headline that speaks directly to their pain point (e.g., ""Your Website Should Make You Money, Not Headaches.""). 
    2.  Write an opening paragraph that shows empathy for their struggle. 
    3.  Create a ""Here's How We Fix It"" section with 3 simple, benefit-focused steps. 
    4.  Write a section titled ""This Is For You If..."" to qualify the right clients. 
    5.  Include a clear Call to Action (e.g., ""Book a Free 15-Minute Strategy Call"").  
    
    Tone: Confident, clear, and benefit-oriented. Avoid technical jargon.

# 10. The Core Belief Autopsy

**Framework Used:** **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - The ""Downward Arrow"" Technique.** A therapeutic technique designed to trace a surface-level emotional reaction down to the foundational, often unconscious belief that's driving it.

**Why it's powerful:** The biggest bottleneck in any solo business is the founder's own psychology. This prompt helps you uncover the deep, limiting beliefs (e.g., ""I'm a fraud"") that lead to procrastination and fear of selling. Solving this is more valuable than any marketing tactic.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a cognitive archaeologist. 
    I want to investigate a recent negative emotional reaction related to my business.  
    
    The Situation: [e.g., ""I needed to send a proposal to a big potential client, and I felt completely frozen with anxiety.""]  
    
    The Investigation (The ""Downward Arrow""): 
    1. What was the specific emotion? 
    2. What was the ""hot thought"" in that moment? (e.g., ""They're going to think my prices are too high."") 
    3. If that thought were true, what would it mean about me? (""It means I'm not worth it."") 
    4. And if that were true... what does it mean? (""It means I'm a fraud."")  
    
    Keep going until you hit a foundational belief about yourself. Stare it in the face. This is what you're really fighting.

I hope you find this useful.

Mila POV

“Do as your mother says.”

Stepmother, you mean, I wanted to say. Instead, I stood silently, my lips pressed into a thin line, as my father informed me that I had to go on this so-called weekend trip they had planned with his friend. I know why exactly this trip was planned and I would rather stay away from it.

The plan is to go on a weekend getaway in the vacation house of My father’s dangerous, mafia friend. Killian Knight. If you’re smart, you stay out of his way. If you’re wise, you become his friend—if you can manage it, that is.

I’ve never met him, only seen photos, but I know enough. And what I know is enough for me to decide that he is too dangerous and too close to my father for comfort. He kills people for a living, and I’ve decided I’d rather live my life without the constant threat of being snuffed out in my sleep. Besides, I can’t go on this little ""family-friendly"" trip. I’ll never have an opportunity like this again: three days alone, unsupervised. There are things I need to do and people to expose.

“But Father…”

“No buts!”

I refrained from rolling my eyes.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Adeline—my dearest stepmother—wearing a smug expression. She tried her best to suppress it in front of my father. She wants this, she wants to secure her son's position as the next chairperson of Anderson Cooperate Empire and also doesn't let anyone know that she is stealing my rights.

The look on my father’s face told me it was pointless to argue.

I am so not in the mood to play Happy Family charade.

“Understood,” I said, trying my best not to roll my eyes or give a sigh. I think I partially lost in the end.

“Don’t look like I’ve just killed your cat. This is a family vacation, and Mr. Knight and his wife have so graciously chosen to host us. I don’t want anyone backing out. We’ll enjoy it like a family,” he said, his rough voice sounding like he had something stuck in his throat.

“Yes, my dear, we most certainly will,” Adeline added, placing her hand over his in what seemed like a loving gesture. My father smiled at her sweetly.

I held back my gag reflex.

“I’ll excuse myself, Father.”

He nodded without looking at me, and I slowly walked out of the study.

The devil’s spawn—my stepbrother—was leaning against the wall, waiting with a smirk on his face. I was sure he was there to gloat over my failed attempt to escape this hell trip.

“Told you it’d never work. Father holds the Knights in high regard, and Mr. Knight invited the whole family, little sis,” he sneered.

“It’s bold of you to assume I consider you family,” I shot back.

“Be careful, sister. If Father hears you talking like that…” He put a hand to his chest in mock injury, then his expression darkened as he cocked his head. “You’ll be out of here.”

I gave him no response to his obvious threat. It was a threat that could very well come true any of these days considering my 21st birthday day is exactly one month away. It will be my end or I will be free from this prison I am forced to call home.

I slipped away down the hallway, past the lobby, and toward the giant staircase leading to the South Wing of the mansion.

This is the Andersons’ ancestral house. My father, Tommen Anderson, is the third-generation Chairman of Anderson Group Of Companies, a multinational company worth over $3 trillion. As his firstborn, I am technically the heir to this corporate empire. But if my stepmother’s scheming works, my stepbrother might end up taking over the company.

I don't need Anderson Empire or neither I am so stuck up to hold on to the fact what was supposed to be mine and create havoc for it. The truth of my life is the shackle around my feet is this legacy and the only way to free it is to own it.

I remember it quite clearly when it was tied to me.

“Only an Anderson will sit on this chair. You must promise me, Mila,” my grandfather said when he first made me sit on the chairman’s chair behind the large, old mahogany desk at Anderson Tech’s headquarters. I was ten years old and had only recently learned that I was an Anderson.

I still remember him kneeling in front of me, looking me in the eye as I sat in the highest chair at Anderson Tech. His sea green eyes—Anderson's eyes, the same eyes I see in the mirror every day— were cold, just like my father.

“You are the only valid candidate,”

I didn't know what to think until it became clear that I had just transferred from an iron cage - my orphanage to a golden one - the Anderson Mansion. He was nothing but a jailer.

Two years later, he passed away.

This weekend was supposed to be my lone opportunity to act without Adeline or Nicolas breathing down my neck. Three consecutive days… but damn her for playing the perfect mother, pretending to care.

For five years, I’ve been careful with every move I make. All anyone knows about me is that I’m an introverted art history student at New York University with massive social anxiety. A simple girl who thought she was an orphan and is now just \*grateful\* to have a family.

Adeline wants to control my every move. She’s no fool, though. She knows she has nothing concrete on me. She has always played the part of a concerned mother. I have seen her actual colors. I will not be waiting for that side to come up again.

My plans will have to wait.

I packed my bag, and the next morning, we were on our way. My father and stepmother rode in the Mercedes, while I was stuck with my stepbrother, Nicolas, and half-sister, Francesca, in the BMW.

“It’s been a while since we went to the beach. I’m excited!” Francesca—or Franny, as she insisted we call her—gushed.

I like her, surprisingly. She’s not annoying. But I hate her hair—the glossy platinum blonde she inherited from her mother. It fell in perfect waves and looked even more angelic paired with the peach beach dress she was wearing. Her eyes were like mine, like my father’s, like my grandfather’s. She is Anderson, after all. Probably the only one who didn't look at me like I was a stranger.

I opened my phone, put in my earbuds, and watched a text pop onto the screen.

Are you coming today? \~ J

Later. \~ M

When? \~ J

3 d. \~ M

Damn \~ J

Yeah, yeah. You and I both.

We left the chaotic rhythm of New York City behind, merging onto the highway as the skyline faded in the rearview mirror. The air changed—cleaner, tinged with salt. A few hours later, we pulled into the Hamptons and parked in front of a grand beach house.

The car came to a halt, and I pulled my earbuds out. As I stepped out, the scent of sea salt filled my senses. If I had to find one redeeming quality about this trip, it was this view. I’d endure the monotonous gathering just for this.

“This is so beautiful!” Franny gushed again.

I glanced at the property where we’d be spending the weekend.

A wide, wraparound porch supported by white pillars overlooked the dunes, while tall, arched windows reflected the fading sunlight. Sprawling gardens surrounded the house, with perfectly manicured lawns stretching toward the sand. Vibrant flower beds lined the walkways, and mature trees cast dappled shadows over a stone fountain at the center of the property. The estate radiated timeless elegance—a true sanctuary.

Nicolas stepped out of the car, groaning dramatically as he put on his sunglasses.

“It’s too hot,” he whined, tugging at the collar of his bright red shirt. A red shirt on a beach trip—typical.

I shook my head, slipping my phone and earbuds into my sling bag and shutting the car door. Still, my gaze lingered on the spectacular view. What would it be like to call a place like this your own?

“Oh, well, we were waiting for you!”

An elegant woman in a white beach dress stepped onto the porch. She was lean, with an A-line figure and a height that gave her a commanding presence. Her warm smile, framed by red-painted lips, greeted my parents.

“Kate, thank you for having us,” Adeline said, performing one of those air kisses high-class women exchange. Kate followed up with a light kiss on my father’s cheek.

“How are you, Kate? It’s been a while,” my father said in what I assumed was his version of a charming tone.

“I’m great. Killian and I have been looking forward to this.”

“Where is my friend—”

As if on cue, our host stepped onto the porch.

Khaki pants. A dark blue, fitted shirt that emphasized his broad shoulders and lean, muscular arms. He ran his hands through his hair, dark and tousled, gleaming under the sunlight.

My breath hitched when his eyes locked on mine.

# Chapter 2

Mila POV

Killian Knight had a presence about him. Even as he walked lazily toward us, it felt as though the very air surrounding him was his domain. His aura dared you to challenge his authority—or look away from him.

“He’s hot!” Nicolai muttered under his breath.

“He’s married,” Franny reminded him.

“So what? Doesn’t mean I don’t have eyes.”

I rolled my eyes at Nicolai.

Mr. Knight removed his glasses as he greeted my father. I instinctively stepped back, away from his line of sight. Father introduced Adeline first, then Nicolai, and finally Franny. Killian nodded in acknowledgment, his actions polite, graceful, and measured.

Something crackled in the air, and my gaze moved to his on its own accord. My hand twitched with an unnamed urge, and I quickly shoved it into my pocket, confused. My heart was thundering in my chest. Was it fear?

I reminded myself that our families had shared generations of friendship. I was just as safe here as in my own home—or so I told myself. I’d always lived this way, constantly questioning. What was there to be scared of now? I wasn’t one to back away from challenges, but I had to keep my stance neutral.

“And who is this?” That deep, sophisticated voice caressed the air as it directed a question toward me.

“This is Mila,” my father answered simply and quickly. His indifference was nothing new to me, but I’d thought—perhaps hoped—that in some corner of his heart, there might be an obligation to pretend otherwise.

“Mila,” Killian repeated, a smile gracing his lips as he stepped aside, his gaze fixing on me with unnerving precision. “Your eldest.”

The glint in his eyes reminded me of a black panther. A jolt of something ran through me, and the air seemed to thin. Mistaking my reaction for fear, I tried to suppress the rush of emotions as he extended his hand toward me.

“It’s a sweet name,” he said.

Without much thought, I slid my hand into his. His touch was surprisingly warm—the kind of warmth you feel sitting by a fire during a snowstorm. Close enough to savor the heat but wary of the burn.

My breath hitched as his large, rough hand enclosed mine, making my own feel small. The sensation sent a shiver down my spine, one I struggled to suppress. My heart raced, and an unfamiliar undercurrent climbed through my nerves. Meeting his eyes again, I gave this feeling a name. It wasn’t fear. It was desire.

“Shall we?” Kate’s voice broke the spell, and my head snapped toward her.

Hell. What was I doing? I withdrew my hand quickly.

“Yes, we shall.” A casual smile lingered on Killian’s lips as he stepped aside.

“This way, Princess,” he murmured, so low I wasn’t sure I’d heard it right.

Kate and the others were already several steps ahead, but Killian walked right beside me. I schooled my expression, but it was difficult to ignore him when I was so hyper-aware of his every move.

“Nina will show you to your rooms. Once you’re settled, I’ll give you a tour,” Kate said.

I didn’t stop or turn to acknowledge her as Nina, the head of the staff, led us. At the foot of the stairs, Killian halted, and I caught the faint trace of perfume. My pace quickened.

“Killian, sweetie,” a voice called from behind.

Damn it. What was I thinking? He’s married.

Killian POV

I am bewitched. Mila Anderson cannot be human and real at the same time. Those sea-green siren eyes were meant to drown every soul they landed on. Her dark red hair cascaded to her waist, and the ripped jeans hugged her curves so perfectly it was almost criminal. She clutched the straps of her messenger bag as if her life depended on it, standing behind her family with her shoulders hunched. But when her eyelids fluttered and her gaze met mine—she had me, right then and there.

Anderson had never brought his entire family with him before. I’ve met his wife and his stepson, who seems to be his shadow. But I’ve never met his daughters. I’ve only caught a glimpse of the youngest once. This one must be the eldest. After a polite greeting, I finally turned my attention to the object of my interest. Mila.

The moment her hand slipped into mine, I knew there was no going back. The current that surged through me wasn’t just attraction or desire—it was something much deeper. Something undeniable.

As Nina showed our guests to their rooms, Mila lingered, trailing behind the others. Halfway up the staircase, she stopped. It would have been too obvious if I followed her, but resisting the pull was damn near impossible. I stayed rooted at the foot of the stairs, my eyes locked on her. She turned slightly, just enough for the corner of her eye to catch mine. I smiled.

She hesitated, almost turning fully toward me, as though she could feel the electric charge between us, pulsing, connecting her to me.

“Killian, sweetie,” Kate’s voice cut through the moment like a knife. Mila jumped and bolted up the stairs.

“Damn you, Katherine,” I muttered under my breath.

I stalked into the kitchen, where Kate leaned against the counter, watching me warily. Her expression told me she knew exactly what was going through my mind.

“If someone saw you looking at her like that, it wouldn’t end well,” she said, her tone cautious but laced with apology.

I folded my arms and tilted my head, smirking. “And how exactly am I looking at her?”

“Like you’re going to devour her,” she shot back bluntly.

“I don’t need a reminder of what I can or can’t do,” I said, my voice sharp.

Kate hesitated before continuing. “She’s Anderson’s daughter. She’s young. Innocent. Don’t seduce her. That wouldn’t be... prudent.”

“Are you trying to be my wife now?” I arched an eyebrow, my tone challenging.

She flinched, unable to meet my gaze. “I have no desire to be,” she muttered, shaking her head.

I pulled out a chair, the legs scraping noisily against the floor as I sat down. The sound made her flinch again, but only for a moment. She straightened, likely reminding herself of her place. Kate was one of the best in my organization. She couldn’t afford to show weakness.

“I’m your friend, Killian,” she said carefully. “This could turn into a disaster. Find someone else for your amusement.”

I leaned back, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.

“You’re misunderstanding my intentions,” I said, my tone deceptively calm.

Her eyes narrowed. “What do you mean? You’re serious about her? You just met her!”

I sighed, leaning forward lazily. “Kate.” My voice was soft, but the warning was unmistakable. “Don’t forget who I am.”

Her expression shifted instantly. Her posture straightened, the same way all my shadows do in my presence—alert, ready, and obedient.

“Yes, sir,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I stood, and she stepped aside instinctively.

“Don’t interrupt me again,” I said as I walked past her.

She gave a sharp nod, and I left without another word.

# Chapter 3

Mila's POV

Killian Knight—the most dangerous man in the U.S.A. A mafia boss. A contract killer. Married.

 I repeated the mantra to myself, willing away the electric charge coursing through me.

My guest room was the last one in the corridor. I thanked Nina, shut the door behind her, and tossed my bag onto the four-poster bed. Pouring myself a glass of water, I downed it in seconds.

Maybe I’d neglected my body’s physical needs for far too long. There was no way I could be attracted to danger.

Throwing myself onto the bed, I took a few calming breaths. This had to be some form of shock.

Before I could dwell on it further, my phone rang. It was J.

 “Are you serious?” Her incredulous tone greeted me.

I sighed. “I know. I couldn’t get out of it. I tried.”

 “You’re in Killian Knight’s house!”

 I shivered—for reasons that had nothing to do with fear.

“I know,” I replied quietly.

J sighed, clearly worried. “Look, I’m cool with a lot of things, and if he were anyone else, I’d say seduce him and take the Anderson empire. But M! He’s dangerous. Get out of there! We don’t know what your evil stepmother is planning.”

I swallowed hard. It would be foolish to say I wasn’t wary, but Jina didn’t need to know that. She was worried enough for the both of us.

“Don’t worry. No one’s going to kill me here,” I scoffed. I hope.

“This isn’t something to take lightly. The man runs a contract killer organization!” she whisper-hissed.

 “And it makes no sense to kill me here,” I mimicked her tone.

 “You just like to play with fire.”

 “What’s life without a little danger?”

 “I don’t need you quoting Harry Potter to me. We have K for that,” she snapped.

I snickered.

“Mila.” Her serious tone stopped me.

 “Hm?”

 “Just don’t die.”

 “Yes, ma’am.”

I hung up, and the smile slipped from my face. Honestly, I’d rather be with J and K than here. My stepmother’s scheming could rot in hell.

Out tour of the house ended by the poolside

As the others retreated inside, I lingered by the poolside. No one noticed as I crouched down, resting my chin on my knees. My heart felt heavy with a sense of lack. My family was always fake, carefully curated for appearances. My father’s indifference, my stepmother’s schemes, and my siblings’ endless competition made it impossible to feel anything real. Even Kate’s warm smiles felt staged, a part of her duty as a host. Everything here was a charade, just like my life.

When would I experience something genuine?

“Do you swim?”

Startled, I nearly tumbled into the water, but a strong arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from inches away from breaking the surface.

I gasped as I collided with something solid. The relaxed air thickened around us, and warmth spread from my stomach to my chest. Cinnamon and coffee enveloped my senses as I looked up.

Killian’s dark eyes met mine, their lethal glint holding me captive.

 “Mr. Knight,” I whispered.

We both were on the floor. I quickly put some distance between us, standing as he got up smoothly, resting an arm on his knee. The corner of his lips turned up. Why did those lips look so soft and inviting as he looked up at me, his hair falling onto his forehead as he cocked his head to the side? Did he look at everyone like that? Like he knew every secret they held, or he could see straight into the core of them?

“Are you alright?”

I nodded. I couldn’t trust my voice right now. I didn’t think I had enough air in my lungs to speak, anyway. I should have moved, but my feet stayed rooted there. He got up swiftly, his movements smooth.

“I didn’t mean to startle you. My apologies,” he said softly, giving a little nod.

I nodded and stepped back.

 “It’s fine. I will…” I pointed to the door leading inside.

“You didn’t answer.”

His voice was soft, alluring.

 “About?” I turned back to look at him in confusion.

“Do you swim?”

“I don’t know how to swim, but it’s nice here,” I said. Is telling a certified killer you can’t swim a good idea? Nope. I needed to get out of his presence. I didn’t have control of my mind—or my mouth—around him.

“Mila!” Franny’s voice came floating. Thank God for her.

“I should go,” I said, moving quickly. I exhaled the moment I was out of his sight.

Killian's POV

The dinner table was set. All that was left was to choose a wine.

I went to the back of the house and opened the cellar door. My grandfather’s wine collection was vast, filled with complex and meticulously aged vintage blends. Now, some of my choices were part of the collection too. Under the yellow light of the basement, I walked through the aisle, mulling over my options.

Finally, I made my choice—Dal Forno Romano Amarone della Valpolicella. Aged meticulously for over a decade, it held notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a subtle spice.

As I headed back upstairs, wine in hand, I passed the staircase toward the kitchen. The sound of light footsteps made me pause. A glimpse out of the corner of my eye stopped me in my tracks.

And there she was.

Mila stood at the top of the staircase, looking down at her feet. Trails of red hair framed her small, square face, falling from a delicate half-braid. The rest of her hair flowed in soft waves over her shoulders. She wore a simple white, long-sleeved V-neck dress that fell below her knees, its hem tinged with a soft shade of blue.

I smiled. She was simple, yet there was something about the way she carried herself that made her impossible to ignore.

Finally, her gaze lifted, and those sea-green eyes widened when they met mine. I smirked in greeting.

For several seconds, no breath passed between us.

“Are you just going to stand there?” I asked, breaking the silence.

At my question, her feet moved—only for her to miss a step.

 “Mila,” I called her name. Was this the first time I’d said it out loud? I couldn’t be sure.

“Are you not planning to join us?” I eased my smile and extended a hand. She looked at it, her expression softening instead of becoming wary, like most people in my presence.

“Come with me.”

She descended a couple of steps before stopping, a small frown appearing as she looked up at me. When she reached the last step, I didn’t move aside.

Her red lips parted slightly.

“Can you drink?” I asked.

“Legally, no,” she shrugged.

 “How old are you?”

 “I’ll be 21 in a month.”

 “You’re young.”

She stepped back a little, breaking our eye contact. “Do I look older to you?”

She tried to step around me.

 “No.”

 “Then what?”

I finally moved, letting her pass, the angle bringing her head close to my chin. I leaned toward her ear.

 “The most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”

She stopped, turning sharply to look at me. Her sea-green eyes weren’t filled with confusion—but awareness. A spark of disbelief flickered in their depths.

“You shouldn’t be saying that,” she whispered. She didn’t look offended or put off.

 “I like to state facts.”

Blowing a stray strand of hair from her cheek, I walked away with a teasing smile.

# Chapter 4

Killian's POV 

When Tommen asked me about this get-together, I thought he was just following tradition—reestablishing the Anderson-Knight generational friendship that his grandfather and mine had started. It was meant to ensure the new generation understood the bonds not just of business but of familial relationships. Yet, I’ve never gotten the impression he cared about any of that. Personally, I don’t either. Only tradition forces me to oblige the Andersons. We meet to discuss business logistics when required, but beyond that, we can barely be called business associates.

I first got to know him during one of these trips. The Hamptons house—our family’s vacation home—is far removed from the world I truly live in. It’s just another façade, like everything else in my life. This place has always served this purpose. With no real explanation for his request, I decided to humor him.

After dinner, we stepped into the garden. He lit a cigarette, and I slid my hands into my pockets, standing under the yellow glow of the garden lights. I looked at him—at the bags under his eyes, barely concealed by the arrogant tilt of his head or the sparkle of his Rolex. My jaw clenched. I despise cigarettes.

“I don’t allow smoking in my presence,” I warned.

“Come now, Killian,” he replied dismissively.

I should never have humored this man. I fixed him with a cold stare, watching as he visibly shivered. He tried to hide it, but the arrogant glint vanished from his eyes. Now he was probably remembering exactly where he was and who he was with. The cigarette fell to the ground, and he stubbed it out. I looked away, impatient.

He seemed nervous now, which wasn’t unusual—I’m used to people reacting that way around me. But his cold eyes reminded me of someone else. Mila. Her wide, shocked eyes and flushed cheeks from our earlier interaction flitted through my mind. I’d much rather be seeing her.

He wasn’t speaking, and I was curious about one thing. One person.

“Tell me about Mila,” I said.

At dinner, her downcast eyes and slumped shoulders had caught my attention. The woman who had looked me in the eye and all but scolded me earlier wasn’t the same woman at that table. That woman had seemed more like a shy girl who couldn’t speak to save her life.

“She’s your eldest, yet you’ve never brought her around before.”

“Don’t be bothered by her. Since her mother died, she’s been reserved. No one’s managed to draw her out of her shell, and she prefers it that way. Adeline insisted she come,” he explained.

During her time here, Mila had only spoken to people when politeness demanded it. She wasn’t close to her stepmother, but from what little I’d seen, she got along with her younger sister.

Tommen’s indifference toward his eldest daughter was glaringly obvious. I clenched my fist in my pocket, noting the affection he seemed to reserve for his second wife. Mila’s lack of interaction with her family made sense, but there was something about the fearlessness in her eyes that felt... different.

“I called you out here to talk about my son,” he finally said, breaking the silence.

My instincts went on high alert as I sensed movement at the corner of a wall about ten feet away. I shifted slightly to keep both Tommen and the shadow in my view. A shoulder peeked out from behind the wall.

“Your stepson,” I corrected, watching his reaction.

“My son needs your support when the board votes for the next chairperson.”

“Why would there be a vote?”

The Anderson succession plan had always been clear: the firstborn Anderson would take the seat. Despite this 70-year-old tradition, which made no distinction between genders, every generation thus far had conveniently produced firstborn sons. By that logic, Mila Anderson should be the next chairperson.

Tommen’s desire to have his stepson as heir would undoubtedly stir controversy among the board.

“You know the board. They’re a bunch of outdated fools who cling to tradition, insisting the firstborn Anderson should take the chair,” he said, clearly agitated.

“And yet you believe your stepson is a more suitable candidate, even though he’s not an Anderson?”

“He is an Anderson,” Tommen said, meeting my eyes for the first time. Interesting.

He looked away, taking a sharp breath.

“The Anderson-Knight bond is the foundation of both our empires. We need strong leaders to uphold that bond. You’ll find Nicolai far more capable than Mila,” he continued.

There were too many pieces of this puzzle that didn’t fit. Normally, I wouldn’t concern myself with such matters, but now... this was becoming intriguing. I needed more information.

“I’ll think about it,” I said, watching his reaction.

It wasn’t the answer he wanted, but he wisely chose not to argue. Nodding reluctantly, he turned to leave.

“Very well, then. It’s settled,” I said, dismissing him.

As he walked away, a puff of smoke curled from the corner of the wall. My lips twitched. Tut-tut.

I approached the wall quietly, keeping my steps light, but the shadow moved as if sensing me. Rounding the corner, I caught a flash of red disappearing around the next wall. I glanced down at my feet, noting the half-smoked cigarette lying on the ground, its embers fading.

My sweet Mila, you’re going to get punished.

Turning away, I headed in the opposite direction, knowing exactly where she’d go. Passing Kate without a word and ignoring Nina mopping by the staircase, I made my way to the back door that led to the pool.

The pool glimmered under the moonlight as I reached the door. There she was, swiftly shutting it and checking over her shoulder to ensure no one had followed her.

Circling the pool, I approached just as she turned around. Her eyes widened in shock when they met mine.

I was too nervous i did three serious faults and two minors. Needless to say, nervousness was absolutely my issue. Sweat and heart rate up to the roof every time i'm behind the wheel.

Today, i'm so stoked to say that i passed with only one minor !  
If you feel like me, that nervousness is taking over you, here are some tips that help me A LOT.

* **Get used to be ""active"" at the booked time of your test,** here's what i mean : My test started a 9:17am which is very early for me, i normally wakes up around 10:30am. I had to get used to wake up a 7am couple of days before my test date to get used to the time, be awake. If your test is in the afternoon and you usually have a nap, try to be active and get used to not having a nap couple of days before, your body and mind will get used to be ""awake"".
* **Have at least two continuous lesson at the same time of your booked driving tes**t time slot before your date. My test date was Wednesday 9:17am. I had both prior Monday and Tuesday 9:30am lesson until 11:30. Get used to the road at THAT time.
* **Watch test routes video.** Every city have test routes videos from a local school.
* **Positivity**. Have an optimistic mindset. I can do it. I will do it. Positivity really helped my mind to focus on the day of the test.
* **Have some nice chats with your examiner.** I know it sound silly and might be considered as a subjective opinion but hear me out : have some nice little chats about everyday life of a human being really help. Just think you are chatting with a friend : What would you be doing at this time normally, what are you hobbies. Have human conversion. Just a little bit a least will create the sense that i have a friend, not an obnoxious robot,  next to me who WANTS to give me a pass, i just have to show him i'am not a learner anymore. People like to talk about themselves, it creates a welcoming and nice environment to work in.
* **Have chewing gums ready.** That's right, gums have been proven to help with stress. It does wonders with me and a majority of people. 
* **Don't try anything new on test day.** No new food, no new breakfast, no more coffee that you usually do.
* **Enjoy**. (And good luck to you all).

My usual workspace (AKA the barn) has been feeling stale lately, so I decided to change it up.

In the bathroom at this coffee shop, taped above the sink, was this note:

https://preview.redd.it/0la3k26lrw8f1.jpg?width=2870&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcceab898ed857db454d64f4555f8b297d9eda01

For some reason, it stopped me.

Not because I’ve never heard those words. But because I often forget to believe them.

Somewhere along the way, we’ve forgotten the simplest, most important truth: ***we are loved.***

Maybe it’s because life’s gotten loud.

We’re busy. And in all that noise, we start to measure our daily worth based on how much we can cross off our to-do list… rather than who we are. *(Hand up, that’s me).*



But those 5 words reminded me of a kind of love that has no limits or conditions:

**“Neither death nor life… nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.” — Romans 8:38–39**

That kind of love?  
It doesn’t waver when you’re not “doing great.”  
It doesn’t retreat when you feel far from faith.

It’s steady. Constant. ***Always.***

So if you need to hear it today:  
**You are loved. By family, by friends, by God — more than you realize.**

Right now. Right where you’re at... Regardless of what's happening in your world this week.

Obviously he was entertaining enough to get famous as a comic, but, compared to today, I'd say he was a rather average comedian. Then he has his show, which wasn't all that successful in the early seasons, but, with his amazing cast and writers, he ends up with the number one show in television. Here he is, in the end, getting paid a million dollars per episode, and, like a boss, walks away from the show at its peak, instead of letting it run too long and get cancelled. 

But it doesn't end there. He managed to secure a royalty deal early on. So, when Netflix paid 500 MILLION dollars to keep the show on their platform, Seinfeld got a chunk of that. Then, he goes on to spearhead the successful Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, and writes Unfrosted (which I thought was great). 

So, in short, he took a chance becoming a rather average comedian in an era when that was more of a side act where you couldn't usually make a living, gains success, creates the top rated show on television, gets paid a million dollars an episode, walks away, has a royalty deal, and is now worth 1.1 BILLION dollars. And also he dated a 17 year old, while he's in his late 30s, and gets very little backlash. 

What a success story. So, at this point, since he got his money from people selling ads to people watching his show, I think the least he could do at this point is chime in on this Subreddit in appreciation of his fans that made him a billionaire. It will never happen, but that would be awesome.",14,1750849177.0,seinfeld,37,0.7,False

Sarah, my best friend, had been the one to tell me about the audition, had even helped me rehearse. ""You're a natural, Elara,"" she'd said, her eyes shining with what I thought was genuine encouragement. But then, a week after my dreams imploded, I saw her name on the Academy's acceptance list. Sarah. The one who always said she ""wasn't really into acting,"" who had only auditioned ""for fun."" My dreams weren't just destroyed; they were absorbed, twisted, and worn by someone else.

For days, a cold, hard knot of resentment tightened in my chest. I couldn't confront her, not directly. That wasn't my style. Instead, I started to subtly, meticulously, unravel the tapestry of her meticulously crafted life.

Some contex I Elara 19 F. and Sarah 19 we were bestfriends since childhood, I didn't imagine she would betray me.

First, there was the academic scholarship. Sarah had always prided herself on her perfect grades, her meticulous study habits. I knew she relied on her comprehensive, color-coded notes, a system she'd developed over years. It was almost too easy to ""accidentally"" spill a full cup of coffee over her backpack during a study session, saturating every single page. The panic in her eyes as the ink bled and blurred was a small, bitter victory. She spent days trying to salvage them, but the damage was done. Her grades for that semester, usually pristine, took a noticeable dip.

Then came the social sphere. Sarah was the queen bee, effortlessly charming everyone. She was always organizing events, the linchpin of our friend group. I started planting seeds of doubt, subtle suggestions to others that Sarah was becoming ""a bit self-centered,"" or ""so focused on her own success that she forgot about us."" A casual whisper about her being late for group projects, a feigned sigh about her always steering conversations back to herself. Slowly, imperceptibly, the invitations started to dry up for her. Group chats went silent when she messaged. The warmth that had surrounded her began to cool.

The final blow, the one that truly cemented the destruction, was her relationship with Ben. They were inseparable, the kind of couple everyone envied. I’d seen Ben’s subtle insecurities, the way he sometimes felt overshadowed by Sarah’s brilliance. It was easy to subtly highlight her perceived flaws in front of him. ""It's so sweet how you always put up with Sarah's need to be right about everything, Ben,"" I'd say, feigning admiration. Or, ""You know, Sarah sometimes gets so caught up in her own world, she forgets to appreciate the little things you do."" I'd share anecdotes, twisted just enough, about Sarah's supposed disinterest in his hobbies, her ambition overriding her affection.

Slowly, the cracks appeared. Small arguments became larger ones. The easy laughter between them turned strained. One afternoon, I saw Ben at our usual coffee shop, alone. He looked miserable.A week later, their relationship was over.

I watched as Sarah's perfectly constructed world crumbled around her. Her grades suffered, her friends drifted away, and the love of her life was gone. She was still going to the Royal Academy, yes, but she was going there alone, with a tarnished reputation and a hollowed-out social life.

She hadn't shattered my head, or my body, but she had shattered my dreams. And in return, without a single raised voice or direct confrontation, I had meticulously, quietly, shattered her life. The emptiness inside me didn't disappear, but it was replaced by a cold, quiet satisfaction.",1,1750848901.0,u_nahirru,0,1.0,False

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'",1,1750848861.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1lk2b32,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1lk2b32/slept_through_break/,Slept through break,"I just finished my second rotation (2 out of 12 weeks total) as a nursing student in co-op. I am coming off my last night shift and I work 4 days and 4 nights and then I have 5 days off (I work another job so maybe 3 days off). I’m having a hard time with the night shifts in particular as I’ve never been someone who naps and I also take Vyvance 20mg daily so I’ve been having to wait all day to take it around 6pm before my 7pm-7am shifts. It is a non negotiable that I take my medication so I can’t stop it, but any experiences with taking a similar dose on nights would be helpful :)

Tonight I actually got to sleep on my break which was scheduled 2-5 (staffed nurses take 2 hours but I get an extra hour as a student when it’s not busy). Unfortunately I didn’t wake up to any of the five alarms I had set and returned to the unit at 6:15. After I woke up from pure anxiety I called the unit and explained what happened and ran back. My preceptor was very nice to me about it and even told me a story about a new hire who did the same thing last week but they slept past 7. The embarrassment walking into the nurses station was unbelievably consuming and I’m having a hard time shaking it off.

Some background: This is my first time working on a hospital unit that isn’t part of clinical placement at school and I have never experienced working a rotation, especially the night shifts. This co-op was optional for students going into their last year (which is me:))) to help bridge any learning gaps before the last two semesters. I guess I found a learning gap. 

I definitely know I’m not the first one to have ever done this and won’t be the last, but my inner critic is going insane. Luckily I have a couple days off from both the rotation and my other job so I plan on prioritizing rest.

Two questions: What is your experience napping on night shift and should I just stay awake (I assume this isn’t the answer)? I think my biggest issue was that I walked home and my brain got too relaxed. But isn’t that a good thing lol being a student I don’t get a spot in the break room where there’s two couches so I’m forced to sleep in a chair, make a chair bed from three plastic chairs, or walk five minutes back to my comfy bed at home. I guess a second part to this question is how do you make a comfy chair bed if needed?

Second question: should I bring timbits to my next shift or is that trying too hard? Lol I’ve wanted to bring in a treat for everyone since I started but I didn’t want to come off as sucking up, you know? But at this point a sweet treat might be a nice gesture. I was going to being my preceptor a coffee but they being their own each shift (fancy stuff too so Tim’s won’t suffice)

Thanks for reading :)

I’m employed, I have my own car, I’m working toward long-term goals, I have a college degree, and I have a solid circle of friends and hobbies that I genuinely enjoy.

I’ve put effort into my dating app profile... my photos clearly show my face and also me doing hobbies I care about (videography, hiking, tennis). My prompts aren’t generic; I try to be playful or sincere. And I do get matches. But here’s the kicker:

As soon as I try to make a simple plan for a coffee, taco, or walk date… I get ghosted. Every. Time. They end up being a story viewer on IG or just leaving me on seen or just reacting with an orange heart which apparently is a sign of them friend zoning me... or so I'm told by my girlfriends.

I don’t come on too strong. I try to keep it casual and light. I’m not demanding or creepy. I’m just trying to genuinely connect with someone.

At this point, I’m starting to feel disillusioned and confused. Like—what else am I supposed to be doing differently?

I’d appreciate any honest feedback. From women, men, anyone who’s been through this or has advice. What am I missing? I'm so close to just checking out of dating altogether.",7,1750847665.0,dating,25,0.82,False
