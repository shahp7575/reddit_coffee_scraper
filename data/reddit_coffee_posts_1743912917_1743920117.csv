Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

Hope you great people can give me some insight I've got a Go 2 which the kids use now but always found the volume on the internal speakers was fairly quiet to use in a busy environment such as a coffee shop with screen readers.  I've had my Pro 9 for almost 2 years to the day and the speakers are much louder so I have no issues working in busy locations.



I'm looking into potentially upgrading to an Oled Pro 11 16 GB RAM either 500GB or 1TB SSD but still nervous to make the jump due to software compatibility and a few nagging questions.



Can anyone confirm if the Intel based pro 10 and ARM Pro 11 has similar decent speakers compared to the Pro 9? and does the Pro 11 still use two speakers at the top or do they use 4 speakers?



Also slightly off topic does the Pro 11 run cooler than the Pro 10?

It's by far the most tedious part of the process. Every roaster lists their info differently, with no consistency in format or detail. So when I scrape the data, I end up with a messy, inconsistent set of attributes. Then I have to manually clean it, standardize the labels, import everything into another sheet, and reorganize it again just to make it print-ready.

some roasters have process varietals into the title name, 

others just have country/farmer as title of the name 

it's getting confusing at this level inputting hundreds

Is this level of detail even necessary?  
  
Is there a smarter way to approach this and cut down the time?

1jsnj5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1jsnj5e/im_struggling_to_cope_and_feel_lost_stuck_in/,"I’m struggling to cope, and feel lost. Stuck in remission and relapse cycle of hell. I used to be into my fitness, now I’m scared to do anything. Undiagnosed still 3yrs.","I’ve been dealing with a yo-yo of symptoms (details further down) for 3 years now, with periods of remission that last anywhere between a few weeks to months. It’s like a sick joke, making me feel safe in my own body again and I’ll start to resume my normal life and do things again. Then slowly it creeps back in, or strikes suddenly with no apparent cause or reason.

I’m getting married later this year and I’m scared to go on a honeymoon or even plan one, because if I get sick it’ll ruin it, I’ll need potential access to medical help and long days walking can bring on my symptoms. 

I’m living my life second guessing my capabilities and pre-convincing myself I shouldn’t or can’t do things. Not only is my body a prison, but so is my mind now. I mourn my old self, prior to being unwell, because it has irrevocably changed who I am now.

My symptoms evolve and shift ever so slightly, so it’s really complicated. But I’m completely left in the dark, not knowing when it’s coming back and how long I’m going to suffer for, or if I’m ever going to recover. I have no quality of life during a relapse, and I’m left housebound, scared, alone and miserable as it isolates me from my life for weeks to months. I’m not sure how intense the symptoms will get or if they’re going to kill me eventually. I just don’t have any answers at all.

I’m clinging on to my career that I’ve worked ridiculously hard to achieve, I have a degree and I’m at a good level in a corporate role. But I keep having 1-2 months off sick every year, and I’m scared it’s going to put my job at risk someday. 

It’s hard to explain, but I’m experiencing a loss of identity and who I am. I don’t know this new “me”. I was confident, outgoing and full of life. I was spontaneous and fun, I was up to do anything. I would travel to see friends on a whim, go hiking or walking without a second thought. I used to be really passionate about rock climbing and bouldering. I’ve had that all taken from me, but in the cruelest way possible. Now, going grocery shopping scares me and doing housework and cleaning makes me worry what it will cost me.

I have an invisible barrier that follows me and punishes me for living my life. All of my limbs work, and some days, weeks or even months I will feel what I think is fully normal and healthy. It’s so deceiving. Each remission period, I slowly work my fitness back up, with walking and slowly increasing the distance. I got into running, and could run a 5k a few days a week which is incredible to me. 

All of a sudden, for no apparent reason, sometimes my body just says “no you can’t do that” or “you’re going to regret that in about 4-48 hours”. 

I could be feeling incredible, I could be doing it in the moment and feel fine during and hours after. But suddenly I’ll be hit by a train of symptoms. I’ll feel like I’m actually dying, and that I should be in a hospital.

I have this horrible feeling come over my whole body, where I suddenly experience weakness. My arms feel heavy and burn, I feel so nauseous that I’m convinced I’m going to throw-up, but typically I don’t. I’ll feel lightheaded and that I will collapse or faint if I try to do anything or stand. It feels like what I imagine bleeding out to feel like, getting weaker and dizzy and being helpless.

I also struggle to regulate my body temperature during these issues, and I’ll experience facial flushing on my cheeks and feel intensely hot. Sometimes I’m not even hot to touch; just my face is red. Other times I become freezing, start shivering and my extremities are cold. There’s also a presence of severe fatigue, and never having energy even after sleeping. My eyes are sometimes left shutting and burning because I feel so tired. I can’t push through the fatigue or tiredness like others think, if I do I’m going to have a bad time and turn pale and feel faint. 

I can’t have caffeine anymore, I gave it up nearly 3 years ago, because it brings on the symptoms sometimes and ever since developing this problem I have a negative reaction to it. I now get uncontrollable sweating and become shakey, just from a few sips of a coffee.

I’m intolerant to heat and struggle to regulate my temperature. I suffered from heat stroke in just 18c / 64.4F. All of my friends were fine. I can’t handle hot rooms or hot weather. The summer is now an anxiety inducing hell to me, I’m scared of hot days. 

I went from being able to exercise and do fun stuff, to exercise intolerance. It’s one of my main triggers now.

I’m scared to drive my car or go out to places alone, because what if I get stranded and I’m too unwell to drive myself home?

Long days with walking, like going shopping? Huge trigger and I can suffer symptoms before I even make it home.

One time it got so bad, that I was violently projectile vomiting and couldn’t keep food or water down, and experienced intense diarrhoea. I ended up hospitalised because my blood pressure dropped to 60/40. When my problem gets intensely bad, my digestive system just goes crazy and kinda fails.

I’ve had tachycardia sometimes out of the blue, but not always. Sometimes there’s no tachycardia involved at all. Early days when I first had the onset of this condition, I had uncontrollable sweating in my hands and feet, soaked with sweat. Alongside tachycardia, faintness, nausea and weakness. I thought I was having a heart attack and dying.

I wasn’t able to eat for 3 weeks, as eating would bring the symptoms on either immediately or within 45 minutes. Thankfully now eating seems to never cause any issues or trigger it like it did 2 years ago.

I’ve had so many blood tests, abdominal CT scan and an MRI scan on my head. All have come back normal, and I still have no medical help to support me or calm a relapse down. I just live through them for weeks to months, terrified and suffering.

I don’t know what to do, I’m incredibly fed up. I’m in a period of remission right now, and I’m scared to live my life and do things. I feel like a shell of the person I used to be, and it’s beginning to harm my friendships and I can’t see my family often as they live far away. My friends are slowly distancing themselves, because I’m sick so often and I’m not in a great headspace during the time I’m sick. I’m not exactly fun to be around when I’m convinced I’m dying.

1jsninq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkinSimplicity/comments/1jsninq/best_moisturizers_for_dry_skin/,Best Moisturizers for Dry Skin,"Do you wake up with tight, flaky skin that feels like sandpaper? Does your face seem to drink up moisturizer only to be parched again hours later? If you're nodding yes, I feel your pain. I've spent years battling Sahara-level dryness, trying everything from budget basics to luxury creams worth more than my phone.

Today, I'm sharing what really works for extremely dry skin. Not just from my experience, but backed by dermatologist recommendations and careful analysis of what makes a moisturizer genuinely effective for those of us with thirsty skin.

# Understanding Why Your Skin Gets So Dry

Before diving into products, let's take a moment to understand what's happening with your skin. Did you know that around **400 mL of water evaporates from your skin daily**? That's more than a tall coffee! No wonder we need good moisturizers.

Dry skin happens when your skin's barrier—the outermost layer that protects everything underneath—gets damaged. This can happen from:

* Cold weather (hello, winter face)
* Harsh soaps and cleansers
* Too much exfoliation
* Aging (our skin naturally produces less oil as we get older)
* Medical conditions like eczema
* Low humidity environments

When that protective barrier gets compromised, moisture escapes, and your skin becomes flaky, tight, and sometimes even painful.

# What Makes a Great Moisturizer for Dry Skin?

Not all moisturizers are created equal. The best ones for dry skin contain a mix of three types of ingredients:

1. **Humectants** \- These draw water to the skin from the air and deeper skin layers. Look for:
   * Hyaluronic acid
   * Glycerin
   * Urea
   * Sorbitol
2. **Emollients** \- These fill in rough patches and make skin feel smoother. Key ones include:
   * Squalane
   * Ceramides
   * Fatty acids
   * Shea butter
3. **Occlusives** \- These create a seal on the skin to lock in moisture. Watch for:
   * Petrolatum
   * Dimethicone
   * Natural oils

The best products for very dry skin usually combine all three types, with a higher concentration of occlusives to prevent water loss.

# Top Moisturizers for Seriously Dry Skin

After testing dozens of formulas and consulting skin experts, here are the true standouts for different needs and budgets.

# 1. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream: The Dermatologist Favorite

**What makes it great:** This thick, buttery cream is the one almost every skin doctor recommends for a reason. It contains glycerin and ceramides high on its ingredient list, plus petrolatum to seal everything in. The formula is truly fragrance-free—not just ""unscented"" which can still contain masking fragrances.

**Real-life performance:** Despite being rich enough for ""alligator elbows,"" the cream absorbs better than you'd expect. It doesn't leave a greasy film and can even work under makeup. Many users report that their skin still feels hydrated when they wake up the next morning.

**Value factor:** At roughly $1.25 per ounce, it's an incredible value compared to similar performing luxury products. The big tub with a pump is especially convenient and hygienic.

**Best for:** Those with very dry, sensitive skin who need serious moisture without irritation.

# 2. Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer: The Sensitive Skin Savior

**What makes it great:** With just 19 ingredients (compared to some formulas with 50+), this moisturizer delivers maximum effectiveness with minimum risk of irritation. It contains hyaluronic acid, glycerin, ceramides, and squalane—all dermatologist-approved moisture champions.

**Real-life performance:** The silky texture glides on and absorbs beautifully. It's fantastic for those with sensitive skin or who use ingredients like retinol that can cause dryness and flaking. Several testers said it felt like a luxury product despite the basic packaging.

**Value factor:** Around $13 for a tube that lasts months, since you don't need much product per application.

**Best for:** People with sensitive or reactive skin who need effective hydration without potential irritants.

# 3. Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream: The Luxury Splurge

**What makes it great:** This high-end formula shares key ingredients with more affordable options (glycerin, squalane) but delivers an extraordinary experience. The texture is luscious without feeling suffocating, and the subtle scent is pleasant without being overpowering.

**Real-life performance:** A pearl-sized amount goes a long way, and the pump dispenser helps control portions (important at this price). The cream absorbs without disappearing completely, leaving skin feeling nourished for hours.

**Value factor:** At $185 per ounce, this is an investment. But if price isn't an obstacle, the experience feels appropriately luxurious.

**Best for:** Those who can splurge and want both effective hydration and a premium experience.

# 4. La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+: The Body Cream That Works on Face

**What makes it great:** Though not specifically marketed for facial use, many with extremely dry skin find this body cream works wonders on the face. It contains niacinamide, shea butter, and glycerin to hydrate while helping repair the skin barrier.

**Real-life performance:** Absorbs well despite its richness and doesn't clog pores for most people. Users report it helps reduce flakiness and tightness even in harsh winter conditions.

**Value factor:** More affordable than many face-specific formulas with similar effectiveness.

**Best for:** Those with extremely dry skin who need intense hydration and aren't finding relief with standard facial moisturizers.

# Beyond the Cream: Tips for Managing Dry Skin

Finding the right moisturizer is crucial, but how you use it matters just as much. Here are some pro tips to maximize hydration:

# 1. Apply to Damp Skin

This might be the most important tip: **apply your moisturizer within three minutes of washing**. When your skin is slightly damp, the moisturizer traps that water against your skin. Think of it like putting a lid on a pot to keep the steam in.

# 2. Layer Your Products

Many people with extremely dry skin find success with a layering approach:

1. Start with a hydrating toner or essence with humectants
2. Follow with a lighter gel moisturizer
3. Top with a cream or balm to seal everything in

# 3. Take Cooler, Shorter Showers

Hot water strips your skin's natural oils, making dryness worse. Limit showers to 5-10 minutes with lukewarm water. Focus on cleaning just the ""dirty areas"" like armpits, groin and feet unless the rest of your body truly needs cleaning.

# 4. Consider Facial Oils

Adding a facial oil as your final step can provide extra protection for very dry skin. Good options include:

* Squalane oil (lightweight but effective)
* Rosehip oil (absorbs well, good under makeup)
* Marula oil (rich but not typically pore-clogging)

# 5. Use an Overnight Mask

Once or twice a week, try using a heavier overnight mask to give your skin an extra moisture boost. You can even use plain petrolatum (Vaseline) or a healing ointment as an overnight treatment on extremely dry patches.

# Ingredients to Look For and Avoid

# Best Friends for Dry Skin:

* **Ceramides** \- These lipids make up about 50% of your skin's outer layer naturally. They're essential for a healthy barrier function and help prevent water loss.
* **Hyaluronic Acid** \- This molecule can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. But be careful if you live in a dry climate—hyaluronic acid needs environmental moisture to work effectively.
* **Glycerin** \- An excellent humectant that draws water into the skin without the potential issues of hyaluronic acid in dry environments.
* **Petrolatum** \- Despite not being glamorous, this is one of the most effective occlusives, reducing water loss by up to 99%.
* **Urea** \- Both hydrates and gently exfoliates, helping remove flaky skin while moisturizing.

# Ingredients to Approach with Caution:

* **Alcohol** \- Can be drying and irritating. Look for ""alcohol-free"" on the label.
* **Fragrances** \- A common cause of irritation, especially for already compromised dry skin.
* **Essential Oils** \- They may smell nice, but many can trigger irritation or allergic reactions.
* **Harsh Exfoliants** \- Physical scrubs can damage your already compromised skin barrier.

# Common Mistakes When Treating Dry Skin

# 1. Over-exfoliating

When you see flakes, it's tempting to scrub them away. But aggressive exfoliation can damage your skin barrier further, creating a vicious cycle of more dryness and irritation. Instead, focus on gentle chemical exfoliants like lactic acid (which is actually hydrating) once or twice a week at most.

# 2. Not Drinking Enough Water

While drinking water alone won't cure dry skin (you'd need to drink gallons for it to significantly impact your skin), being dehydrated can make matters worse. Aim for at least 8 glasses daily.

# 3. Using the Wrong Cleanser

Many cleansers strip natural oils from your skin. Switch to a creamy, hydrating cleanser without sulfates. Consider oil cleansing or cleansing balms, which remove dirt and makeup without depleting your skin's moisture.

# 4. Skipping Sunscreen

UV damage can worsen dry skin issues. Always apply a moisturizing sunscreen during the day, even in winter or on cloudy days.

# 5. Using Too Many Active Ingredients

When dealing with dry skin, simplify your routine. Too many actives like retinol, vitamin C, and acids can irritate and dry your skin further. Focus on hydration and barrier repair first.

# My Personal Experience

I've had chronically dry skin since my teens. I tried everything—expensive department store brands, natural oils, even straight-up Vaseline (hello, greasy pillowcases).

The game changer? Learning about skin barrier function and the science of hydration. I switched from foaming cleansers to creamy ones, started applying moisturizer to damp skin, and layered products from lightest to heaviest.

My current routine includes:

1. A gentle hydrating cleanser
2. A hyaluronic acid serum on wet skin
3. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream
4. A drop of squalane oil patted on top

For especially dry patches or when the weather turns brutal, I do what skin experts call ""slugging""—applying a thin layer of healing ointment as a final step at night. Yes, it feels a bit weird at first, but the results are worth it.

# When to See a Dermatologist

If you've tried various moisturizers and skin care strategies but still struggle with severe dryness, flaking, or irritation, it might be time to consult a dermatologist. What seems like simple dry skin could be:

* Eczema
* Psoriasis
* Seborrheic dermatitis
* Rosacea
* Contact dermatitis
* A reaction to medications

A dermatologist can properly diagnose these conditions and recommend prescription treatments if needed.

# Final Thoughts

Finding the right moisturizer for extremely dry skin takes some trial and error. Our skin needs change with seasons, age, and even hormone fluctuations. Don't get discouraged if the first (or second or third) product you try doesn't work miracles.

The good news? You don't need to spend a fortune. Some of the most effective products for dry skin are available at your local drugstore. Focus on ingredients and how your skin feels rather than fancy packaging or marketing claims.

Remember: consistent application matters more than an occasional luxury treatment. The best moisturizer is the one you'll use faithfully, morning and night.

What's your experience with dry skin? Have you found a holy grail moisturizer that works wonders? I'd love to hear about it in the comments!

The formula has a mix of b vitamins (inspo from liquid IV), l tyrosine, creatine, coq10 (cellular energy supplement) and then regular soda additives like citric acid gum Arabic liquid cane sugar, flavorings, carbonation. Salt for electrolytes. 

I don’t want to market it as a stupidly marked up health nut product since there’s plenty of that, but instead as a TYPICAL ENERGY DRINK without caffeine. Why?

I’ve struggled with fatigue after being diagnosed with a health issue, and unfortunately I cannot drink caffeine due to sensitivity. I realized I was jealous of people who could just crack an energy drink or a coffee every day and feel energized. I can’t even drink tea or a soda. It also seems like whenever a brand offers caffeine free options, they always sell them as a juice, and I don’t always want juice. 

Then I realized besides for the fact that caffeine makes me feel TERRIBLE, it is an addiction, it dehydrates you, and it gives you a jittery type of energy.

I want to design a CLEAN ENERGY + electrolyte hydration and caffeine free delicious tasting energy drink that gives you energy while INVESTING in your health and doesn’t have risk of overdose/heart issues, jitters, dehydration, addiction, or general side effects from taking in too much caffeine— this is what I want to appeal to the general public. As a Plus, caffeine allergic people like me will finally have something to drink. As well as people who opt for decaf options, which is common. 

Coq10 and L Tyrosine are some supplements that boost energy and cognition, fueling your cells and sharpening focus. B complex is obviously important for energy. Creatine noticeably improves physical performance and stamina. These are all safe and healthy supplements. My drink will be CELLULAR FUEL, MENTAL CLARITY, and real clean energy- not jittery heart-speeding caffeinated poison. (Being a bit dramatic here 😩).

If you examine the photos attached, you will see that the coffee is on special at NW, Woollies and Fresh Choice which is standard stuff. However when viewing the price history over 3 months, you will realise that the coffee has been even cheaper in the past.

Supermarkets can trick us with “on special” signs to make us buy items thinking we are saving a decent chunk of money. But the truth is, some discounts are tiny…I’ve seen some saving as little as 6 cents off the original price. 

This frustration is part of the reason we built Grosave, a Grocery Price Comparison app that helps you shop smarter and shows you when there is a genuinely good deal.

Although Price History isn’t our main feature, we believe it is significant because it provides a data-led solution to the lack of price transparency in supermarkets, including when the best day is to buy coffee cheaply.

My accomplice was my roommate, Liam, a perpetually sarcastic but surprisingly loyal soul who owed me big time for helping him out of that unfortunate incident involving a borrowed llama and the Dean's prize-winning petunias. Liam’s role was primarily lookout and supplier of questionable moral support.

The night before Sarah’s birthday, under the cloak of a surprisingly foggy campus, we executed our daring raid. The storage closet was surprisingly unlocked (apparently, no one considered the theft of a giant squirrel suit a high-security risk). Inside, hanging limply from a precarious hook, was the object of our desire: the full, gloriously goofy Nutsy mascot costume. The oversized head, with its perpetually wide, slightly manic grin and comically large buckteeth, stared back at me with an almost accusatory air.

Getting the bulky suit back to our dorm room without being seen was a feat of awkward maneuvering and hushed whispers. Liam, despite his initial amusement, grew increasingly nervous with every rustle of the plush tail against a bush. Once safely inside, the sheer absurdity of what I was about to do hit me. I, a relatively normal (if slightly clumsy) engineering student, was planning to impersonate a giant squirrel to surprise a girl in a coffee shop. What could possibly go wrong?

The next morning, armed with the pilfered costume and a heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and impending doom, I made my way to “The Daily Grind,” Sarah’s favorite caffeine dispensary. Liam, wisely opting to observe from a safe distance across the street, gave me a thumbs-up that looked more like a gesture of pity.

Donning the Nutsy suit in the cramped bathroom of the coffee shop was an exercise in claustrophobia and tangled limbs. The vision through the mesh eyes was surprisingly limited, and the oversized paws made gripping anything a challenge. I felt like a toddler wearing their parent’s clothes, only much, much furrier.

Taking a deep breath, I waddled out into the bustling coffee shop. Sarah was sitting at our usual corner table, engrossed in a book, a half-empty latte beside her. My plan was simple: approach her, give her a big, furry hug, and then dramatically remove the head to reveal my charming (or at least recognizable) face.

The execution, however, was less than graceful. The oversized feet of the costume proved to be my nemesis. Halfway to Sarah’s table, my left foot caught on the leg of a stray chair. What happened next felt like slow motion. I flailed my arms (or rather, furry appendages), trying to regain my balance, but the center of gravity in a giant squirrel suit is notoriously unforgiving.

With a muffled “oomph,” I went down, the momentum sending the massive squirrel head rolling across the tiled floor like a runaway bowling ball. The sudden commotion drew the attention of everyone in the coffee shop. Sarah looked up, her brow furrowed in confusion as she took in the sight of a large, furry body sprawled on the ground and a detached squirrel head rolling towards the pastry display.

For a moment, there was stunned silence. Then, Sarah’s eyes landed on my distinctly un-squirrel-like sneakers sticking out from under the plush torso. Recognition dawned, followed by a slow, disbelieving shake of her head. And then, the laughter started.

It wasn’t a polite chuckle or a nervous giggle. It was a full-bodied, unrestrained belly laugh that echoed through the coffee shop. Tears streamed down her face, and she clutched her stomach, gasping for air. In between peals of laughter, she snorted her latte, sending a spray of milky foam across the table.

Mortified but also strangely relieved, I managed to awkwardly sit up, still encased in the furry prison. Liam, who had witnessed the entire spectacle from across the street, was now doubled over with laughter himself, attracting curious glances from passersby.

Finally, Sarah composed herself enough to speak, wiping tears from her eyes. “You… you actually… Nutsy?” she choked out, before dissolving into another fit of giggles.

With Liam’s help (and a considerable amount of struggling), I managed to脱下 the squirrel head. My face was flushed, my hair was a mess, and I probably had a faint imprint of the mascot’s mesh eyes on my forehead. Sarah, however, was still laughing, though now with a more manageable level of hysteria.

“That,” she finally said, catching her breath, “was the absolute craziest, most ridiculous, and honestly, the funniest thing anyone has ever done for me.” She reached out and squeezed my hand, a genuine smile replacing her tear-streaked amusement.

The rest of the morning was spent recounting the disastrous surprise, much to the amusement of the coffee shop staff and the other patrons who had witnessed the event. Sarah, between sips of a newly acquired, snort-free latte, kept shaking her head and chuckling.


While Operation: Squirrel Surprise didn't exactly go according to plan, it undeniably achieved its goal of making Sarah's birthday memorable. It wasn't the smooth, romantic gesture I had envisioned, but it was undeniably us – a little bit clumsy, a lot ridiculous, and ultimately filled with genuine affection. The great mascot mishap became a legendary tale in our friend group, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most heartfelt (and hilarious) gestures are the ones that go spectacularly wrong. And who knows, maybe somewhere out there, Nutsy the squirrel is still wondering where his head went that morning. 
TL;DR As for me, I learned that while grand gestures are nice, sometimes a good laugh and a shared moment of utter absurdity are the greatest expressions of love of all.",0,1743919275.0,tifu,1,0.2,False

1jsndok,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1jsndok/a_theory_about_the_apothecary/,A theory about The Apothecary,"I was re-reading these passages about the Apothecary and they got me thinking.

> ""Once upon a time, on a distant planet, there lived a lonely creature. This planet teemed with flora and fauna, all of them growing and evolving and generally thriving and having a great time as they dashed forward through the eons. This creature also wanted to thrive, she also wanted to have a great time. But there was only one of her. She could not have children of her own. And this made her very angry, very cranky, but also very sad.
>
> ""More importantly, it made her determined. And as Doctor Ian Malcom once famously said, Life, uh, finds a way.
> 
> ""The creature had a special ability. Her stomach was like a gas-station coffee vending machine, one where you could pick one of a thousand different choices. You could mix and match. She soon discovered if she ate this creature, she could make this substance. And if she ate that creature, she could make a different one. So she began to experiment. The creatures of her world thought of her as an apothecary. She could cure all ails.
> 
> ""But what she truly wished for was to create a child of her own. And after a thousand generations, she did just that. Almost. It’s a complicated process that involves a lot of failures. A lot of troublesome ghouls.** But as another Earth saying goes, you need to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, no?
> 
> ""What these wriggling parasites you see really are, are clones. The next part of the Krakaren story, where she discovers the ability to speak to all of clones telepathically, and then eventually form a collective mind, where she starts spreading across the universe and making a general nuisance of herself is for a different time.

- *The AI, Book 3*

> The Krakaren is a real creature. It is a collective mind, and it is spreading throughout the universe. Its proliferation causes a lot of anxiety. A better translation of its name is the Apothecary because of its ability to synthesize elements. When they call it the Krakaren, it’s them deliberately bending the translation into a negative. What we have here in the dungeon is a caricature.”

- *Mordecai, Book 3*


We know that the dungeon's presentation of the Apothecary is caricature, but in order for the caricature to be recognizable it still has to be based on known things about the entity. And if we start stripping out the clearly-Borant bits of the story and thinking of the rest in terms of what we already know about Primals, I think we can arrive at not only the history of The Apothecary, but also of what caused the great split between the Primals.

---

My theory is that The Apothecary was the one who invented the primal seed/macro AI system. The idea was that:

- She'd choose an empty dimension/plane of existence to start with--one where she could scatter a huge number of primal seeds
- Each primal seed would contain the formulas for growing a subset of the biological life present on the surface of her own planet. If a stable planet formed around the seed, it would then spur the growth of whatever biological life was programmed into it.
- Into each stable seed planet she'd implant a residual of herself that would then actively manage the planet
- Each residual--now its own individual despite still being part of the communal Apothecary mind--could, if it chose to do so, *also* create its own ""child"" by making a residual of itself

In this way, despite having no ""natural"" method by which to reproduce, the Apothecary was able to figure out how to create offspring of a sort and allow them to flourish in tandem with the biological life that sustained them.

That last part--""biological life sustaining them""--would end up being the problem that led to the great conflict between the Primals.

This line:

> ""She soon discovered if she ate this creature, she could make this substance. And if she ate that creature, she could make a different one. So, she began to experiment.""

Makes me think that prior to The Apothecary's experimentation, the whole ""consuming primal engines for sustenance"" thing either wasn't something the Primals did, or it wasn't something they did *consciously.* But once she realized she could do it--and this knowledge was shared with the other Primals--the implications were clear: if a Primal consumed enough biological life, its power would grow. And with all the life the Apothecary had just seeded in the universe, an enterprising Primal could enjoy unchecked power for damn near eternity.

The Eulogist was one such enterprising Primal. Based on the AI's conversation with Carl and Donut in Book 7, my theory is that the Apothecary initially tried to get The Eulogist on board with her ""populate and thrive"" plan, but it was *way* more interested in munching up her hard work.

There are few different ways things could shake out from there. Whatever the exact path to it was, *something* happened that turned the Eulogist into such a big threat to the other Primals that they were forced to lock it into its own mind and render it inert.

The other Primals return to whatever plane of existence they normally exist in. As for the Apothecary, since all of this was caused by her obsession with reproduction--something unnatural to their kind--she gets branded a traitor and is forced to abandon her plans and decommission all the factories she built so that what happened with the Eulogist can never happen again.

Unfortunately for the Primals, sapient life rallied from its Eulogist-induced brush with extinction and reached a point of technological advancement that allowed it to explore their own planets and the stars--and in doing discover the system the Apothecary left behind. And once they figured out how the whole primal seed/macro AI/primal engine relationship worked, they decided to start feeding the newly awakened AI at the center of their own system--The Eulogist--so that its power can grow and be used to their own benefit.

The problem is that, much like we're seeing with our own AI, with greater power comes greater will and independence. I suspect that The Apothecary wants the Eulogist dead because if it's able to break free from its prison, it's going to use its power to instantly kill the *quintillions* of life forms now living in its enhancement zone, fueling it up for a speed run of consuming/extinguishing all life in the known universe as its zone expands to include our entire plane of existence. 

The death of all life is what Agatha (and I assume the Primal she split from) wants. I'm not sure how an ultra powerful Eulogist benefits her, however, other than as a means to accomplish that goal. Since she and her team identify themselves as allies of the Eulogist I'm sure they get something out of it, though.

And that's my theory! Would love to hear your thoughts!

A year ago, Slothana had turned his $500 into $150,000, and the viral Slothana game had pushed his earnings to $200,000. His mom’s Hawaiian vacation photos still warmed his heart, and the tech hub’s coding classes were thriving. But the crypto world was restless. A rival raccoon meme coin had surged, stealing Slothana’s spotlight. Some community members sold off, dropping his total to $180,000. Forums buzzed with doubt: “Raccoons are the new vibe,” one user posted. He sighed, feeling the pressure.

The game’s success had also drawn attention. A venture capitalist emailed, offering $500,000 for a 30% stake—but they wanted to ditch Slothana’s branding for broader appeal. The idea stung. Slothana wasn’t just a coin; it was the community that had cheered him at the crypto meetup, the sloth that had defied the odds. He took a walk to clear his mind, passing the tech hub. Kids were coding a game—a sloth racing a raccoon. “Team Sloth!” they cheered, waving. He smiled, an idea sparking.

Back home, he posted in the Slothana forums: “Raccoons think they’ve got us beat. Let’s show them sloths are unstoppable. Who’s in?” The community rallied with sloth emojis and memes. He called the game developer from the meetup, suggesting a “Sloth vs. Raccoon” feature. The developer agreed, and they got to work. He emailed the VC: “Thanks, but Slothana is the heart of this game. Let’s grow without losing that.” By evening, the game update was trending, and Slothana’s value ticked up slightly.

As the sun set, he felt renewed. The raccoon coin was a challenge, but also a chance to prove Slothana’s resilience. With the community behind him, the game evolving, and his purpose intact, he was ready for what came next. The sloth’s lesson held true: slow and steady could still win. 🥰",7,1743919048.0,Slothana,1,1.0,False

1jsn9xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1jsn9xb/she_cheated_on_me_while_on_vacation/,She cheated on me while on vacation,"Where do I even begin? Let me give a little backstory I guess, I'm a husband, father of three little kids, the sole provider for my family, work 12 hour shifts (2 days, 4 nights) and have 2 days off then it repeats (I make decent money almost $26/hr), my wife is a stay at home mom to our kids. 

We have been together for almost 8 years in May and will have been married for 5 years in August. 
 
Me and my wife had pretty much hit the roommate phase and everything had just felt like it was a routine and we were both just going through the motions of life between our kids, my work, and everything else in our lives. I can honestly say that I was just mentally, physically and emotionally tapped out a lot of the time recently because of over exhaustion from working so much, barely sleeping, and trying to make time for our kids and time for ourselves. We had stopped going out on dates and trying to put ourselves first. 

Well, I had the idea that I was going to do something nice for her because I could tell how burnt out she was from just constantly being around and taking care of the kids most of the time. (Which is understandable, they are a handful and I've expressed to her numerous times that I don't know how she manages to do it because I don't think I could.) 

I had been sleeping on the couch for the past month and a half or so because she said she couldn't sleep with my snoring and just never really wanted me back in the bed. 

After running the idea by her I decided to send her off on a vacation to a nearby city that was only like an hour away and I had made it to where her trip would be from Feb. 26 - Mar. 2nd. She's never really had much of the chance to go out and do things and to actually relax and enjoy herself away from the kids. So I told her to invite one of her girlfriends and that they could go together. Now, she knew about this trip because it had been planned a little over a month in advance. I had arranged for them to stay at a decent hotel, bought tickets for them to go to the aquarium, and paid for a 120 minute massage for both of them that would've been on the day before they left. I paid for everything. I even gave her $3,000 to do whatever she wanted with and so she'd have plenty of shopping money or for whatever (I gave it to her the day before she left). So the trip is scheduled, everything's already been taken care of and she's just pretty much counting down the days to go. 

Fast forward a week or two after planning trip, she becomes very distant. She is on her phone a lot, but I noticed she was on her phone even more than usual. I tried not to pay any attention to it because I didn't want to make any assumptions when she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her. She's constantly texting. There's just something that I can tell is off with her. I try not to pay it no mind and try to give her her space as needed just in case she was just feeling depressed or down and just didn't want to be bothered. 

Around Valentine's Day, I had to work on that day and didn't get off till 6:30pm. So I came home and helped her get the kids to bed and then left with my oldest to the store to get her some valentines presents. By the time I came back she was already asleep in bed. So I just figured I'd surprise her and set it up all nice and displayed on the kitchen counter. I'm not going to lie I am usually very heartfelt with cards and writing in them but our oldest son was acting awful in the store and in the car so I barely wrote much in the card just trying to get home and get him out of the car so he could get in bed. Well the next morning I was already at work by 6am. So of course she texts me when she wakes up thank you, it's beautiful you shouldn't have, I love you so much and so on and so forth. So I get home and as far as I could tell she was happy to see me but still couldn't leave her phone alone. She has always given me her phone without me even having to ask for it because she's never had anything to hide, same goes for me with her. But I noticed any time I even remotely reached for her phone whether to look at it, try to look at the time or anything of the sort she would just kind of snatch it up and hold onto it. I didn't necessarily think anything of it because maybe she was texting some of her girlfriends and it was just girl stuff that I didn't need to see? 

A week or so before the trip, she's going out more. She's constantly going out on car rides just driving around listening to ""music"". We each have Life360 so it's not like I couldn't see where she was. She never went anywhere really just actually driving around. So I'm thinking to myself maybe she is just listening to music and needs a break because she's overstimulated or something of the sort. But she's becoming more distant. She keeps kind of just blowing me off, not really paying me any attention or kind of showing that she actually cared. 

In this week time, we've been kind of arguing because she tells me that she wishes I didn't have to work so much so we could spend more time together. And I whole heartedly agree, except if I don't work as much that means a bill does not get paid. We were arguing one night and she blatantly told me that she wanted to fuck someone else but couldn't necessarily tell me why. I was taken aback because I just wasn't prepared for that. I was hurt by her even bringing something like that up. I told her what happens in (city's name), stays in (city's name). I was just wondering to see what she would say. And then she told me that she could never do that. The night before she left, I made it abundantly clear that despite the little arguments that we've had, that I did not want that nor would ever be okay with her doing something like that and that I loved her with all my heart and that we can work on us when she came back to just enjoy her time away from the family. 

The day she's leaving to the vacation the 26th. She's packing and making sure she has to everything she needs to take while her girlfriend is on the way to pick her up and them drive there. She makes sure to take a little teaser vibrator with her and I remember asking why do you need to take that? And she told me that ""in case I start missing you. Then I can send you some videos."" And I was like alright bet hell yeah I'm down with that. I made sure to tell her that I hope she has a great time and to text me when she can. 

They get there and check in to the hotel and get settled in. Then she lets me know that they're going to the aquarium and then afterwards they were going to the mall to shop and look around. I was telling her okay just be careful I love you and just stay in touch (my constant fear was of like something awful like kidnapping or Grape that's why I wanted her to stay in touch, two girls in a big city by themselves just you never know with people). Nighttime rolls around and she kind of blows me off so I'm just like whatever she's having fun and just catching up with her girlfriend. I video chatted her briefly so the kids and I could tell her goodnight. 

The next morning she texts me and asks me to video chat before taking our son to school so I did just that. Didn't hear from her till 10 or so and they were getting their nails done at a salon. 5pm rolls around and I haven't really heard from her so I call her to try to talk to her and she was just very brief on the phone and just trying to get off the phone with me so I was a little offended and told her to just message when she gets the time and I hung up on her. Then she keeps saying how ""she can barely enjoy herself bc I'm being a dickhead"". You ever felt like you're annoying the one person you just want to talk to or hear from? Yeah that shit sucks. So we go back and forth for a few and then still don't hear from her around 8pm. So I text her ""you good"" and she never responded the rest of the night. 

Feb. 28th 
Called her in the morning and barely got a response from her other than she was going back to sleep because they had been up since 2:30am so I was just like okay you need to rest then. She tells me she never got a message from me and then blows up. No text from her for the rest of the day then video chat for 4 mins to let kids tell her goodnight. Then I find out that she was going to go to a club with her girlfriend. (She made it abundantly clear before she left that she didn't want to go to any clubs or anything like that when they went because she's never been to one). Her friend apparently got too drunk at the bar in the lounge and she had to be ""rescued"" by my wife so their plans had gotten cancelled. I had barely even spoken to her all day so I asked her to send me a picture of her nails and she did and I noticed she did not and was not wearing her new wedding band that I recently got her that was a good chunk of change. Told her I missed her and wanted to talk to her and she told me that ""not rn dealing with her friend"". Tried calling a couple more times till about 11pm and she wouldn't answer. Messages me saying she passed out because she had been drinking this was around 1am but I was asleep. 

Mar. 1
She messages me in the morning asking bout the kids and we video chat for 6 mins. They were supposed to have the spa packages today and they never went. She said ""they got distracted talking and swimming at the pool"". I just paid over $300 for nothing? Never heard much of anything from her after that. I knew they had went back to the mall that day, rode go carts, went out to eat afterwards, then went back to the hotel that evening. She told me they rode the go carts and said it was fun around 3pm. Nightime rolls around and I'm trying to get her to answer so the kids can see her and tell her goodnight because they missed her (being away from her for 4 day now). No answer. Message her after getting them in bed telling her that it was shitty to do that, it's one thing to do it to me but not to those kids because she's their whole world. She replies and snaps at me pretty much saying how it's her last night there and she don't see why it's a big deal and that it's her vacation that she's going to see them tomorrow. Told her I don't appreciate her not contacting me pretty much the whole trip. She goes on about how she's allowed to have a night to herself. She then proceeds to tell me that her girlfriends ex told her that I was cheating on her and that's why she hasn't contacting me much while gone. I have never ever cheated on her. Never reached out to another woman or done anything with anyone else but her. Never even spoken to another woman over the course of our whole relationship. I reassured her that I had never and that he was lying and she should've just talked to me about it. I tell her how lonely and unwanted it made me feel. Then she tells me that her and her girlfriend almost ""did something"" but she stopped because she couldn't go through with it. She said they started kissing and her friend was giving her hickies on her boobs and that's when she stopped, they were both completely clothed and nothing else happened. I was upset I'm not going to lie thinking how could she have done that to me? I started making light of it and just joking around with her trying to diffuse the tension. Nighttime nothing else is said 

Mar. 2- Day she's leaving 
She is apologizing for what happened and says she just can't wait to get home and see us so they're packing and then leaving. She gets home and even after being ignored the whole vacation I had decorated with balloons and banners saying ""we love you"" and ""we miss you"" and had gotten her some gifts that were waiting for her. She barely even acts surprised and is just kind of getting annoyed with the kids. She was home maybe an hour and then says she's going to go pick up her other friend that lives near us and smoke with her. I was like alright that's fine? But you literally just got home you can't wait a little bit and just spend time with us? She goes and smokes with her and comes back and is just right back to being on her phone. She had visible hickies on her boobs and we ended up having sex that night despite me feeling hurt over her ""almost"" doing something. 

I called out from work that whole rotation because I just wanted to spend time with her after her being gone. She barely spent time with me and continuously left the house going on rides or going to smoke with her other girlfriend. 

Over the course of the next two weeks she becomes even more distant. Taking every chance she gets to pretty much leave me with the kids and just be away from me as much as possible. She went with the other girlfriend to another mall and they spent a whole day together. Every time I would ask her why she was avoiding me or doing everything she can to get out of the house she told me I was being paranoid and that she was allowed to go out and do things by herself and have time to herself. Over this two week span she was probably home and actually here with us maybe 4-5 hours a day (all the other time it was either she was asleep, our riding the roads, or going to hang out with that other girlfriend. She then goes to spend the night with other girlfriend on Mar. 15 and I could barely get a response out her while she was there. I know where she was and I know there was no one out of the ordinary there so I had no reason to worry. Then she comes home at like 3am saying she just couldn't deal with them being drunk anymore. The next day Mar. 16 she is still barely conversating with me and just being on her phone. She then tells me that her mom called her and needs ""help unpacking"" because they had recently moved. So she leaves at like 7pm and goes to her mom's the next state over (a little over an hour away). 

Mar. 17
She goes and gets coffee while still at her moms and stayed there till about noon. Then the in-laws followed her back home so they could see the grandkids and spend time with them for a little bit. They leave and she's right back to her phone. I keep asking what she's doing or who she's talking to and she would just give me one of her girl friend's names every time I asked. We end up drinking and she gets absolutely wasted. I saw my opportunity. I took it. I got her phone away from her while she was asleep (yeah ew I know, I was desperate and wanted answers because she clearly wasn't being honest.) I went through her phone and couldn't really find much out of the ordinary other than a phone call with some number I've never seen before on the night of the 15th @ midnight and was on the phone for an hour and 47 minutes. I suspected she was doing stuff behind my back so while I had her phone I downloaded a spy tracker app on her phone. (Yes again EW but I was desperate for the truth). She caught me with her phone and got it then I went to bed around 5am and just blatantly asked her who the hell that was. She tells me that she's been super depressed lately and that it was someone from one of the 'hotlines' trying to talk her down. I still didn't believe her and asked why she hid it and she just beat around the bush so we went to bed.  

Mar 17.

We woke up to our oldest waking us up telling us he was almost late for school. It was around 7:45am or so. We got up and I threw some clothes on to rush to take him to school. Get back and then she wants to go on a ride or something around 10am. Checked the spy tracker. Noticed she called that number again, as soon as I left the house taking our son to school so I'm like tf? This spy ware was pretty cool so I could actually hear their conversation from when they were talking on the phone. I was heartbroken with what I heard. She starts off by telling him that ""she told me that he was someone from a suicide hotline, that he was pretty much like her therapist because in a way he was because he was listening to her problems."" Then I hear him say ""you still down to give me head"" and she just blatantly goes ""give you head? Yeah of course I'm still down to."" And they talk about that for a few minutes and I'm completely distraught dropping to my knees screaming because I can't believe what I just heard and what she just said to another man. Then I noticed she had texted him before the call literally warning him that ""I know something is up and to not contact her again until she proves it's her by sending a voice message back"".  I had to play dumb and pretend I didn't know anything. So I didn't say anything to her about it. We continued on about our day and I carried the charade on. She stayed on her phone the majority of the day and just left the house whenever chance she could get. 

Mar. 18 
I have to go to work so I'm there by 6am. I check the spy ware app throughout the morning and notice something strange. She's downloaded two different apps telegram and wakie. I had no idea what the hell they were so I downloaded them myself to found out it's literally used to communicate with randoms. Then I see something completely off the wall. She was entertaining multiple different guys and talking to them. Not just talking to them. But sexting. She literally let one guy describe how he wanted to fuck her from behind in front of a mirror and ""that was interesting that she had never done that before and wondered what else he could do"". Telling other guys she loved them. Receing dick pics and commenting on how big or how she ""liked it"". I'm disgusted. I'm taking a break in my car and am just doing more and more digging into this spy ware and find that she has been sending guys nudes and talking to multiple different guys at a time. I'm heartbroken. I can't even focus on what's going on at work so I leave and came home. I played it off as I had a migraine and just couldn't deal with it. All throughout the day I'm dropping little hints because at this point I'm about to blow up and can't hold it to myself anymore. I even start trying to talk dirty to her and suggest new ideas for the bedroom for us. I suggested we fuck in front a mirror and she's like what why? So I pretty much word for word quoted what that guy had said to her just to see if she would say anything. She didn't. She leaves a couple times going on rides. She comes back and it's after dinner time and we're getting ready to get the kids to bed and she says ""once we get the kids in bed, I'll tell you everything"". I told her coldly that "" already knew everything, that I had put a tracker on her phone and seen some of the messages and nudes she had sent and received. Kids go to bed. We're arguing and that's when she tells me that she's been talking to that one guy on the phone since she's been back from vacation and that the ""other girlfriend"" is who suggested the apps to her when she came back and that she had been sending nudes and talking to other guys since she's been back. That she would wait till I was working or when I was sleeping or when she was out ""listening to music"" that that's when she was contacting them. I was so hurt and broken. I remember crying myself to sleep on the couch. 

Over these past two weeks since she's been back and when she was on vacation I had a feeling in my gut and every time I tried to ask her about it or tell her I think she's hiding something she completely denied it and lied to my face. Every. Single. Time. (Up until this point). I had not been taking care of myself, I had barely been eating and couldn't sleep much at all. 

Mar 19 - the reckoning 
I went to work. My stomach in knots. Feeling like I was being suffocated. I was in disbelief, shock. I was angry, humiliated, hurt, broken, betrayed, used. I checked the spy ware again. My wife had already texted her friend warning that there was spyware on her phone and that she couldn't talk over the phone without me knowing about it. Then I noticed her best friend that went on the trip with her, had called her shortly after me being at work. Then she said does he know about Colten? 
Who the fuck is Colten? So I texted her and asked and she's ""I'll just leave. I'm so sorry. I don't deserve you."" I got fed up and called her yelling and demanding that she tell me who this guy is. That's when she said it. I remember as soon as it came out of her mouth, my ears started ringing loudly and my face began to boil. ""Remember how I told you me and (best friend) almost did something? That isn't the truth. I slept and had sex with another guy on vacation. We met at the bar in the hotel and one thing led to another"" I lost it. I got so angry and upset and said some hurtful words because I had been hurt. I operate heavy machinery in an industrial plant environment and therefore did not feel like my 100% undivided attention was on the job and I felt as if I was going to end up injuring someone with the heavy machinery due to my lack of paying attention. I left and headed straight home. The wife and kids were gone when I got there. Her location had been cut off and I had no idea where her or our children were and I was frantic, she wouldn't answer my calls or texts and I became more worried. Long story short, she was hiding at a friend house with the kids. I do have a temper at time yes but I have not ever put my hands on her. I finally convinced her to come back home that she was being ridiculous and we needed to talk about this like two adults. She comes home and we get the kids fed and in bed. Then she's apologizing telling me she's so sorry that she shouldn't have done it. Over the course of the next two days I was out of it. Like here but not here. I was trapped in my mind replaying all the what ifs or making up scenarios in my head. We barely talked about it because she just wouldn't talk about it so it constantly led me wondering and making up stuff. 

Mar. 21 - the truth. 
This day is but a blur. Shit happened. I was already depressed but this had amplified it 10X more. I went to see my primary Dr and told her the feelings that I'm having and thoughts that I'm having are not safe. Surprise surprise. She wants me committed. Had to sign a piece of paper stating I would drive myself to the ER or else uniformed officers would escort me pretty much against my will. I never go to the Dr. for anything and this was my first ever encounter with this dr. I was just trying to be honest with myself and the dr so they could somehow begin to help my depression and anxiety. Finally the truth fully comes out. And it was something I never could have expected. Get home and tell my wife what I have to do or else the cops will take me against my will. I'm freaking out. Never been admitted. Never tried to seek help for my mental health before this. I'm crying my eyes out telling her that I'm scared and that I don't want to go. We go on a ride as a family and get some food and just all eat in the car. Then we drive around for a little bit to spend some time together before I have to go to the ER and that's when she told me. She told me that her and this Colten guy had fucked twice while she was on that vacation (says it was all in the same day). Here's the kicker. It was all planned. It wasn't random coincidence or drunk luck or wrong place wrong time. No. She had been talking to him two weeks before she even went on that vacation. She said he found her somehow on Snapchat and that's how they started talking. Two weeks would put it right before Valentine's Day. A week before the trip she had invited him and told him about her going on vacation. Want to know the even shittier part? We live in NC. This dude lives in OK. He literally drove 16 1/2 hours to fuck my wife. They supposedly spent 2-3 days together while she was there all the way up until she was leaving. They slept in the same bed for two nights. The day before she left is supposedly when all of the sex stuff happened. They were drinking and one thing led to another. Then it happened again later that night. I literally thought I had died. I had a panic attack and freaked out. It felt like I had just been stabbed in the heart. 

I was admitted. Got out in two days and started some new form of antidepressant. When I got out things were definitely not okay between us. You could literally feel the tension in the air as if it was a balloon just filling up more and more until it popped. 

She lied to my face every single day for 39 days. 

I keep finding more and more little details out about their encounter as time goes on. Every time I try to talk to her about it, she gets irate and says she's done talking about it that it's in the past , it happened and there's nothing we can do to change it. He apparently was going through a divorce. The first time there was foreplay (fingering, kissing and shit like that). She supposedly (the 2nd time) had her hands handcuffed behind her back. She gave him head like that. He fucked her from behind and in missionary like that. (SHE EVEN SHAVED FOR HIM BEFORE SHE WENT ON VACATION- I noticed she shaved down there and was like what'd you do that for? And she said she just wanted to feel good about herself). Oh yeah remember that little teaser wand that she was going to use for when she missed me? Nope. He had apparently asked her to bring a toy for him to use on her and that's what she brought. She was still in contact with him after the trip and was still sending him nudes on Snapchat. Then he randomly reported her on Snapchat on March 10th and she got her account disabled and supposably has not been in contact with him since. There is still so much more that isn't being said. I want to know how it happened, what was said between both parties (before, during, and after the whole encounter), why she did it, why I'm not enough for her to not do that, how she could do that to us, why didn't she actually communicate with me before any of it happened, why me. I only just found out today that he supposedly has a video of her giving him head. ""She didn't know he was recording while she was doing that and he showed it to her when they were packing their stuff up getting ready to leave. She told him that he needed to delete that and he said that he wanted to start something by sending it to me and she said she didn't agree with that. 

Two weeks after finding out that monumental truth I still am barely here. I'm so wrapped up in my head overthinking and over analyzing everything that I can barely focus on day to day tasks or even give my kids my full undivided attention. I told her I want to work things out with her, we needed to go to counseling both together and separately and that it was going to be a lot to rebuild the trust and love between us after something as detrimental as this happening. But I'm still noticing patterns. I took the spy ware off her phone because frankly I don't know if I could handle seeing any more of that shit first hand and in real time. She's still on her phone a lot. She won't talk about the whole incident much. She still leaves every chance she gets to go on rides and ""listen to music"". She still throws a tantrum if I ask to see her phone. She swears she's not going anything else and that she hasn't. She doesn't see why I can't keep accepting the bullshit excuses or half hearted words. The more patterns I keep recognizing, the more I want to withdraw from this relationship and pretty much life itself. But I can't help but feel as if I'm failing her and the vow that I made to her on our wedding day. Not that it matters to her (but I'm the type of person that won't even take his wedding band off for literally any reason at all. Since the day we got married it has not left my finger.) I love(d) this woman more than anything and was beyond grateful that she was in my life and that she was the mother of my children. I've literally dedicated everything to her. 

I was able to track down and find Colten's wife (ex-wife?) on Facebook and reached out to her. I told her I knew something he had done I just wasn't sure who he was to her. She told me that he was her husband. I got her number and called her and spilled everything that I knew to her. She was in just as much disbelief as I was. She couldn't even comprehend what I was saying. Apparently Colten had left her on Valentine's Day with absolutely no reason or explanation at all. He kicked her out of the house and all of her belongings as well with no warning or anything. They had been together for 6 years and had just been married for 3 months. Until he magically didn't love her anymore. She said she didn't know what had happened but now that she knows all of this then it makes perfect sense. She and I believethey have been talking since before Valentine's Day because we both agreed who talks to someone for supposedly two weeks then agreed to drive 16 1/2 hours just to fuck them? I've only heard from her here and there telling me she was sorry and me telling her the same since we are pretty much in the same boat together. And us both telling each other that we did not deserve that. My wife will not talk about it and just denies anything that I ask her. 

I have no friends or family to talk to about any of this, it's just her. I need advice on what to do? My heart is now telling me that I can't keep putting myself through this pain but my head keeps telling me to remember all of the memories we have formed over the years with us having our kids and even before them and hope we can work back to that. I am caught in a continuous loop of never ending torment. Whether it is my brain reenacting the scenario or thinking of all the other things that have occurred. 

I'm sure I've probably left some things out, there's been too much to remember. 

I need advice and support if possible. Thanks in advance, sorry for the long post. ",0,1743918680.0,survivinginfidelity,3,0.25,False
1jsn9vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1jsn9vb/manipulative_mil_or_aita/,Manipulative MIL or AITA,"Sorry for the long post, but I am fuming!!!!!

We live far from both our families. We have the only grandchild on both sides. When MIL (FIL is dead) stays with us she stays for 4-6 weeks at a time. The first time about 6 months ago I was weaning from breastfeeding. It was incredibly emotional and I was a wreck. On top of having another adult in our living space that I end up having to clean up after. I admit I have high standards of cleaning, but every day multiple times a day I’m cleaning up her crumbs, coffee stains from her coffee mug, etc. It gets annoying, but I deal. Once in a while I admit I say things like, “this countertops are annoyingly white and it shows everything, I feel like I’m constantly cleaning.” Etc etc. I also am constantly having to (nicely) remind her or ask her to wash her hands because hand hygiene just isn’t something she practices. It gets exhausting. I’ll see her sitting on the couch with basically one of her fingers in her mouth sucking on it. Whenever we go outs in public she touches EVERYTHING!! We wash our hands a lot with a LO in daycare to try and keep everyone healthy. I am also an incredibly forward person, just how I have grown into myself, and don’t have a problem (nicely) calling people out, especially if it has to do with my daughter. 

Well last time she stayed with us she ended up getting upset and telling my husband she doesn’t feel welcome and that she feels like we’re always cleaning up after her and she can’t do anything right (she also told my husband not to tell me she said this). I had a heart to heart with her and just explained to her we loved having her there and we have no issues and we just have a lot going on and blah blah blah. I am just a forward person and it doesn’t mean I’m annoyed necessarily. Even after she left I apologized again bc I did feel bad about the situation. 

This time I have made a huge effort to make her feel more welcome. We’re in the middle of moving so she’s been very helpful watching our daughter here and there and I’ve been thanking her and praising her constantly. And I actually am very grateful and not nearly as annoyed with her as I was last time. I have been stressed with balancing work, the baby and moving. I admit I get moody (I’m also very early pregnant again) but I think to a normal degree considering all that is on our plate right now. Today she was talking about Octamom and how she thought how that whole situation was disgusting and I politely said, “I think that’s a privileged way of thinking and I don’t think any mother trying to care for her children should be called disgusting.” My husband and I go out to run a house errand and tells me he’s mad I called her out on that and I said I was nice about it and it’s important for me to call people out on stuff like that if they’re are going to be an influence on our daughter. We fought a little about it and maybe my MIL heard some of it. But then I go about my day and don’t think anything else of it. Same as everyday I’m wiping the counters, cleaning her crumbs and coffee stains, etc etc. We run a few errands all together and we watch a show all together after we put the baby down. I didn’t think anything about today. 

I’ve also been pretty vocal about how I don’t want to go to my brother’s twins wedding next year for various reasons. I’m guessing she doesn’t like that but I do have plenty of reasons. 

Then my husband tells me before bed that his mom brought up in a round about way that she kinda wants to go home because she feels like she’s getting in our way and causing issues and we’re just cleaning up after her. He tells her no that’s not the case it’s okay and I guess calms her down. She tells him again not to tell me this conversation happened. 

I’m livid though for 3 reasons: 
1. I feel like she’s making it seem like I’m acting some sort of way that’s making her feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome even though I’ve been going out of my freaking way to be gracious and thankful. It’s really pissing me off. I almost feel like she’s using me as a scape goat so she can go home without saying she just wants to go home
2. She’s told my husband now twice something and to not tell me which I don’t think is fair for someone to ask to keep a secret from their spouse 
3. I feel like my husband didn’t really stand up for me. He didn’t ask why exactly she feels this way and try and stand up for me. 

Is my MIL being manipulative or AITA???",1,1743918673.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sunday, people!

This week’s host is travelling and will be here tomorrow, so I’m stepping in for today.

I’ve been thinking about coping mechanisms lately. Since I got sober I’ve done a lot of work, been through several rounds of therapy, I’ve fallen into different dysfunctional and harmful coping strategies, and would so much like to be done already. But we’re only human, right? We will never be done, and I’ve come to see that as a good thing. Every day is definitely not a gift, but the chance to wake up and explore every day is.

Many of us need different tools and aids to heal. But the one thing I believe everybody have in common is the need for self love. So simple, so difficult. Today I’ll show self love by walking slowly through the day, being mindful to the sun, the sounds, the coffee. How about you? How can you show self love?

I will not drink with you today!

# Best Tall Gaming Chairs 2025: Top 5 Ranked & Reviewed (For Big & Tall Gamers)

Are you a taller gamer tired of squeezing into chairs that feel like they were designed for someone half your size? Do you suffer from back pain after long gaming sessions, wishing you had proper lumbar support? Then you've come to the right place. Finding the perfect *tall gaming chair* can be a game-changer, literally. This guide will delve into the top 5 *tall gamer chair* options for 2025, meticulously ranked and reviewed to help you make the best choice for your needs and budget. We understand the struggle, and we're here to help you discover the ultimate in comfort and support.

## Why You Need a Dedicated Gaming Chair for Tall People

Standard gaming chairs frequently enough fall short (pun intended!) when it comes to accommodating taller individuals. They may lack sufficient back height,offer inadequate lumbar support,or have seat depths too shallow for agreeable thigh support.This can lead to poor posture,back pain,neck strain,and general discomfort,significantly impacting your gaming performance and overall well-being. Investing in an *ergonomic gaming chair for tall people* is not just about comfort; it's an investment in your health.

Specifically, a *gaming chair for 6ft man* or woman needs to have a higher backrest and a deeper seat pan than a standard chair. The headrest should reach a comfortable height,providing proper neck support,and the lumbar support should effectively cradle the lower back,promoting a natural spinal curve.

1jsmx06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jsmx06/i_suck_at_playing/,I suck at playing,"Every time I play with my kid (4F) my mind starts to wander. All the things thst could be done pop up, empty the dishwasher, pit the next load in the washing maschine etc. I know these don't need doing right now and try to push the thought away. But even the really important things that need doing very soon and the things I have totally forgotten, are right there again. It gets to a point where I just jump up and get the job done.

Also my needs suddenly become pronouced. Did I need to pee before we started playing. No, but now I do. Did I want to make a coffee/grab a quick snack? No, but now I want one urgently. 

Playing is just not very stimulating for me and I think I am abig part of the problem -  I really lack fun ideas. When other people engage in playing with my daughter they come up with the most interessting turns and fun plots. My mind isjust and endless list of things I have to do - no room for funny stories.

All we do is the same sequence over and over. Mostly whatever toys were playing with wake up, have breakfast, buy food for dinner, prepare dinner, have dinner go to sleep. Maybe sometimes they go for a swim. That may sound like much but it is basicly just found and some minor activity and its not very fleshed out. Eating food is ""okay now they're having breakfast - done"" and so on. 

Plus I am kind of lazy. I work, do chores and work out. But when it comes to playing I just want to sit comfortably and not move scenes all the time. 

I find it much easier to do actual activities like paint her face to make her look like a dragon, go to the zoo do some watercolor/coloring in or reading to her. I don't get lost in things to do then either.

Unfortunately while kiddo is sure down for those things they don't want to do them forever or they are not things I find the time for every day. 

I also found it much easier to play with her when she was smaller. Then I could read to her for hours and the pretend play - I kind of suck at - was less interessting to her and she would quickly lose interest and wanted to do something else.

1jsmwyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jsmwyx/woke_myself_up_from_creepy_dream/,Woke Myself Up from Creepy Dream,"I said out loud, “Call (husband),” and woke myself up. 

In my dream I couldn’t get my phone to work right so I told Siri to call him. He was on the road coming home from another state, which he really is right now. I dreamed I got our daughter to bed and when I left her room the whole layout of our house was different. It was actually very similar to the house I lived in when I was 3 years old.. but the yard was our yard. I thought I heard a neighbor outside the window calling me and let up the blinds to look outside, but there was only a cat out there I could barely see in the shadows. I started meowing at it, and it started walking. At the same time, a cat in the house ran to the couch beside me and started rubbing against me, but we don’t have a cat. I had never seen this cat. I started to freak out and yelled at it to get away from me. My dogs started going crazy in their kennels. 

Then I realized the whole house had been ransacked. Pillows were thrown around the living room. There were blankets and trash everywhere. Then the coffee machine started running by itself making coffee, but I didn’t remember starting it.

Suddenly I was in our real house again and my daughter was screaming and crying and thrashing around in her sleep. I started to go to her, but I was also trying to call my husband to tell him I thought someone had broken into our house. (Strangely, I remember thinking it was either this crazy woman I know from work, whom I haven’t actually spoken to in years, or my ex-boyfriend, who has actually been dead for years.) 

My phone wouldn’t go to the right screen and kept glitching, so I finally just told Siri to call my husband, and that woke me up. It took me a few minutes to realize none of that stuff that seemed so real was really happening.

(Forgot to say I’m 19m) I’ve been diagnosed with both ADHD and Dyslexia at a younger age but never for autism, and since I’ve turned 19 and been looking at stuff as well after I was told I may have autism, I do get tested this December so that may come up with answers that would explain stuff as a kid. When I was a kid (I have no memory of but my parents and family tell the same old story about me as a kid) I didn’t speak till I was over 3 years old, I always slept in the most odd places in the apartment, I would sleep under coffee tables (that I could fit under) and I would also sleep under beds as well, and I would always have my small blanket (that I still have to this day) and my spider man blanket (that I also still have). As I got older I stopped sleeping under things and the odd places as well. 

When I did get older, I got into many things and still are into those to this day, I’m into undertale, Hazbin, helluva, Epic the musical, Star Wars, marvel, Greek mythology, and anime, and those are just really the big main ones.
I can’t tell you how much I’m into robots and mechs as well I think they are so cool to me, and my top 3 movies are Iron man, Real Steel, and Pacific Rim. But even then I feel like there’s a lingering thought in my head at all times telling me “you might be faking it, you are just weird and aren’t normals” genuinely bad stuff that I don’t want to think about really. 
Another thing I’ve also noticed lately is that when I talk about something that makes me happy or about something that I’m passionate about I start to really stutter over my words a lot (just something I’ve noticed) 

I would say more but i honestly can’t remember all much before 9th grade (sorry if it’s hard to read I can’t find the right words atm). 

Idk if it’s part of this but I feel like every time I see something on my skin (like one of those weird dead skin things that you pull and it just rips your fingers) and I just feel like I rip and tear at my hands on a daily basis

My goal is good, unique food and chilling out (good coffee a bonus) while taking in the culture. But I prefer to avoid overtourism and a Disneyland-like experience. (Not looking for hiking or outdoor adventuring.)

As such, I'm sensing that I'll be disappointed with Lijiang and Dali, and might be happier with Shaxi and Weishan. (Correct me if I'm wrong! Or suggest another location.) But Shaxi and Weishan look a little trickier by public transportation.

Questions:

1. Thoughts on my thoughts above?
2. How would I be able to get from Chengdu to Shaxi as a first stop? (Or would I need to overnight in Lijiang? I prefer to avoid single-night stops.)
3. Possible to find transportation from Shaxi to Weishan? (Again, prefer to avoid an overnight in Dali unless convinced otherwise.)
4. Easy enough to go from Weishan to Kunming?

Any and all thoughts and recommendations would be welcomed and appreciated!

\[ETA: If too ambitious/difficult, my first inclination would be to give up Shaxi and maybe just go to Dali and Weishan, as Weishan is of more interest to me than Shaxi.\]",1,1743916349.0,TravelProperly,0,1.0,False

Post:

---------------------------------------------
Hey fellow Redditors,

Grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and let's dive into the paradoxical world of "".""

🔼 What is ""."" ?
You might wonder why I chose such an enigmatic title for this post. Well, here's the thing, ""."" represents silence. It denotes a state of quietude, an absence of sound or words. Yet, silence can speak volumes and hold significant meaning. It is both emptiness and potential, a gateway to reflection and contemplation.

🤔 What can ""."" teach us?
Silence invites us to listen, not just with our ears, but with our hearts and minds. In the absence of words, we start paying attention to the subtleties, the non-verbal cues, and the unspoken emotions. We develop a deeper connection and understanding of those around us.

💭 Reflecting on the power of ""."" 
In a world saturated with information and constant noise, embracing silence becomes an act of rebellion. It enables us to disconnect from the chaos and indulge in introspection. We gain clarity, find inner peace, and rediscover the beauty in simplicity—as if the silence itself is a secret door leading to a hidden oasis within our souls.

📢 The paradoxical effect of ""!""
But here's the paradox: ""."" can also be unsettling. It magnifies our insecurities and forces us to confront uncomfortable truths. It reveals our vulnerabilities, fears, and the thoughts that we suppress with the constant hum of noise. In silence, we face ourselves, stripped of distractions and faced with our own raw essence.

🔔 ""."": A tool for self-discovery
Rather than fearing silence, let's view it as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement. Embracing silence can help us cultivate patience, empathy, and mindfulness. It allows our thoughts to settle, clearing the canvas of the mind and",1,1743915789.0,magicalignment,0,1.0,False

________________________________________________


1. Lack of Transparency and Historical Cover-ups
Criticism: The LDS Church is accused of hiding or whitewashing troubling aspects of its history and doctrine, leading members to feel betrayed when they discover information from outside sources. Critics argue that the Church was not upfront about issues like Joseph Smith’s polygamy, changes in doctrine, or the way its scriptures were produced.
Evidence:

Former members report that many controversial facts (e.g. Smith’s multiple wives, or that he used a seer stone to translate scripture) were omitted or downplayed in official materials. When the Church finally published essays addressing these topics (2013–15), “for many, these… included information they did not previously know… Some felt betrayed because they were not taught the truth in their local congregations”. This sense of betrayal has led to a crisis of trust in LDS leadership.

Even a Church historian acknowledged a wave of disaffection driven by such issues. In 2012 Elder Marlin K. Jensen noted that “we’ve never had a period of… apostasy — like we’re having now,” with members leaving “in droves,” partly due to controversial history circulating on the internet.
LDS Defense: Church leaders respond that they are becoming more transparent and that difficult history is now being confronted “warts and all”. They note that much of this information was always available in scholarly sources, even if not widely taught in church. Leaders like Dieter F. Uchtdorf have frankly admitted that “there have been times when… leaders in the Church have simply made mistakes” and done or said things not in harmony with doctrine. However, they maintain that such human error doesn’t negate the Church’s divine foundations. The Church now publishes Gospel Topics essays and a comprehensive history (the Saints volumes) to provide faithful context for these issues, emphasizing that ultimately faith should not rest on imperfect people but on personal conviction and the core spiritual claims of the religion.



2. Authenticity of LDS Scriptures (Book of Mormon)
Criticism: Atheists and ex-Mormons often claim the Book of Mormon is not an ancient record as the Church teaches, but a 19th-century work of fiction composed by Joseph Smith. They argue there is a glaring lack of archaeological and genetic evidence to support the book’s narrative of ancient Israelites in the Americas, undermining its authenticity as scripture.
Evidence:

Despite the Book of Mormon’s detailed stories of ancient civilizations in the New World, mainstream experts have found no archaeological evidence of the peoples or events it describes. The National Geographic Society, for example, stated it is “unaware of any archaeological evidence that would support the Book of Mormon”. No ruins, artifacts, inscriptions, or DNA conclusively link Native American cultures to the Israelites as the book claims.

Modern DNA studies strongly conflict with the Book of Mormon narrative that Native Americans descended from Israelites. Genetic research shows Native populations originate from Asia, not the Middle East, and scientists note that *“the claim that the principal ancestors of the American Indians are from the Middle East is unfounded in current archaeological and genetic research”*. This lack of DNA evidence for an Israelite migration is frequently cited by critics as a tangible refutation of the book’s historical claims. Additionally, critics point to anachronisms in the text (steel, horses, chariots, etc. in pre-Columbian America) as further evidence it was authored in the 1800s, reflecting Smith’s environment rather than ancient reality.
LDS Defense: The Church maintains that the Book of Mormon is the word of God and a literal ancient record, but urges caution in how evidence is interpreted. Apologists argue that absence of proof is not proof of absence – they note that much of Mesoamerican archaeology is still incomplete, and that a small migrant group’s remains might be hard to identify. The Church’s official essay “Book of Mormon and DNA Studies” suggests a “more careful approach to the data,” stating that “much work remains to be done to fully understand the origins of the native populations of the Americas”. Some LDS scholars propose that the Book of Mormon peoples were geographically limited and intermingled with others, which could make Israelite DNA signals dilute or undetectable. Ultimately, the Church teaches that spiritual witness, not empirical evidence, is the surest proof of the Book of Mormon’s truth; members are encouraged to read and pray about the book and trust the spiritual confirmations they receive.



3. Book of Abraham Translation Controversy
Criticism: The Book of Abraham, part of LDS scripture, is accused of being a proven fraud. Joseph Smith claimed to translate this text from Egyptian papyri, but Egyptologists (both LDS and non-LDS) have examined the same papyri and conclude Smith’s translation bears no resemblance to the actual content. This suggests to critics that Smith did not have divine translation powers, undermining his prophetic credibility.
Evidence:

Egyptologists overwhelmingly reject the authenticity of Smith’s translation of the papyri. Indeed, ever since the 19th century, numerous non-LDS experts have examined Joseph’s explanations of the Egyptian facsimiles and the characters. Their verdict has been unanimous – his interpretations are inaccurate and not at all what the Egyptian text says. For example, figures that Smith identified as Abraham or Egyptian idols are, according to scholars, ordinary funerary scenes from the Book of Breathings. This consensus that Smith’s “translation” is incorrect strikes at the heart of his claims.

The original papyrus fragments that Joseph Smith used were rediscovered in the 1960s and translated by modern Egyptologists. The results were devastating to the LDS narrative: the papyri turned out to be common Egyptian funerary documents (parts of the Book of the Dead), *“bearing no relation to the Book of Abraham text.”* In other words, nothing in the Egyptian writing mentions Abraham or matches Smith’s story. One prominent Egyptologist, Dr. Robert Ritner, concluded that the Book of Abraham is “an erroneous invention by Joseph Smith,” not an ancient record at all. Such findings present concrete evidence that Joseph Smith’s translation gift was not genuine as claimed.
LDS Defense: The Church acknowledges the translation questions but offers alternative explanations. One theory is the “catalyst” model – that the papyri inspired Joseph Smith to receive revelation about Abraham’s life, rather than being a literal transcript of Abraham’s writings. In this view, “Joseph’s translation was not a literal rendering of the papyri… Rather, the physical artifacts provided an occasion for… revelation” about Abraham. Another argument is that we have only fragments of the original papyri; perhaps missing portions (now lost) contained the actual text of the Book of Abraham. In short, LDS apologists say a direct textual match isn’t necessary for the scripture to be true—what matters is that God revealed truth to Joseph Smith through the papyrus. The Church points to a few purported ancient parallels in the Book of Abraham and continues to include it in canon, emphasizing that its truth can be confirmed by praying about its teachings. While critics remain unconvinced, faithful members accept the Book of Abraham on faith and view the translation discrepancies as either a divinely guided “adaptation” or simply a mystery yet to be understood.



4. Polygamy and Joseph Smith’s Marriages
Criticism: The practice of polygamy in early LDS history – especially its secret origin under Joseph Smith – is a major source of disillusionment. Critics contend that Smith’s plural marriages were unethical and evidence of deceit. He married dozens of women, including very young girls and other men’s wives, all while publicly denying he practiced polygamy. This behavior, they argue, is inconsistent with him being a true prophet of God.
Evidence:

Secret multiple wives: Historical research has confirmed that Joseph Smith took up to 40 wives in the 1830s-1840s, though he had only one legal wife (Emma) publicly. Many of these were kept secret from most church members. The women ranged in age from 56 down to just 14 years old (Helen Mar Kimball being the youngest). At least a few were already married to other living men when Smith married (or “sealed”) them to himself – a practice known as polyandry. Such facts were not openly taught for well over a century, and learning of them has shocked many Latter-day Saints who were raised to believe Joseph had only one wife.

Denial and deception: Smith’s polygamy was conducted in secrecy. He and close associates flatly denied practicing plural marriage during his lifetime, even as he continued the practice in private. Church leaders did not publicly acknowledge Joseph’s polygamy until many decades later in Utah. Critics view this secrecy and outright public denial as a serious integrity issue. They note that even Smith’s first wife Emma was often kept in the dark or unhappy about the practice. The covert nature of early polygamy – “participants were asked to keep their actions confidential” and did not discuss it publicly – has led ex-members to question why God would direct behavior that could not withstand public scrutiny.
LDS Defense: The Church contextualizes polygamy as a commandment given by God for a specific time and purpose. According to LDS teaching, Joseph Smith “received a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage” and introduced it carefully among a small group of believers. It was an extraordinary test of faith – even Joseph found it “among the most challenging” of commandments. Apologists note that plural marriage had precedent in the Bible (prophets like Abraham and Jacob had multiple wives). They argue that 19th-century polygamy was instituted to “raise up seed” (have more children among the faithful) and bind families together. The secrecy, they say, was due to the hostile legal and social environment; polygamy was illegal in Illinois, so disclosure could have destroyed the church. In LDS narratives, many early plural wives later testified of spiritual confirmations that the principle was of God. Ultimately, the Church teaches that polygamy was a divine command for that era (1840s and, later, in Utah), but that God rescinded the commandment in 1890. Today, the LDS Church disavows the practice and excommunicates any member who engages in unauthorized polygamy. They acknowledge the discomfort modern members feel about this history, but maintain that judging 19th-century commands by 21st-century standards should be tempered by faith that God’s ways are often not our ways.



5. Racial Priesthood Ban and Past Racist Teachings
Criticism: The LDS Church’s historical treatment of Black people is frequently condemned as racist and fundamentally inconsistent with a church led by God. From 1852 to 1978, the Church barred men of black African descent from holding the priesthood and excluded black men and women from temple ceremonies. Critics argue this policy was not divinely inspired but borne of 19th-century racism, noting that leaders for decades espoused theories about Black people being under a curse. This issue carries heavy emotional weight, causing many to question or leave the Church, especially as societal racial equality has improved.
Evidence:

The priesthood/temple ban: For over 125 years, LDS policy discriminated by race. “From 1852 to 1978, [LDS] temple and priesthood policies…prohibited both Black women and men from [receiving] temple ordinances and ordination” to the priesthood. In practice, this meant no black man could hold any church leadership office or perform priesthood rituals, and black families could not partake in the religion’s highest sacraments like marriage sealing. This ban endured through the tenures of numerous church presidents without any scriptural mandate, which deeply troubles critics (why would God deny blessings based on skin color?).

Racist justifications: Early LDS leaders gave explicit racist explanations for the ban. Brigham Young taught that black people bore the “curse of Cain” and “never can hold the Priesthood” until all other lineage had received it. In an 1852 speech, Young proclaimed that persons with African blood could not possess “one particle of power” in God’s kingdom until the end of days, and he identified the “mark” of Cain with “the flat nose and black skin”. Such statements – that Blacks were divinely cursed to be inferior or servile – were repeated by subsequent leaders for generations. These teachings are cited by ex-members as morally repugnant and strong evidence that the Church’s past prophets were influenced by the racist culture of their times rather than by revelation.
LDS Defense: The modern LDS Church has taken steps to repudiate its past on this issue. In 1978, church president Spencer W. Kimball announced a revelation ending the priesthood ban, extending full privileges to members of all races. More recently, the Church **“disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse… or that blacks…are inferior in any way”**. Current leaders emphatically condemn racism, past or present. The Church’s stance is that we do not know exactly why the ban began (some attribute it to Brigham Young’s personal policy), but only that it has now been corrected by revelation. In LDS apologetics, it is often noted that many Christian churches in the 19th century were segregated or racist; the LDS Church was unfortunately “a product of its time” in this regard. However, members believe that God eventually set the matter right through the 1978 revelation (now canonized as Official Declaration 2). Today the Church highlights its global membership and organizational integration of all races, asserting that “all are alike unto God.” While critics are unsatisfied with the lack of an apology from the institution, the Church prefers to look forward, emphasizing unity and the idea that continuing revelation can correct even long-standing human errors in the Church.



6. Treatment of LGBTQ+ Individuals
Criticism: Many atheists and ex-Mormons vehemently criticize the LDS Church’s stance on LGBTQ issues, calling it harmful and out-of-step with basic compassion. The Church’s doctrine condemning same-sex relationships and its political activism against same-sex marriage have led to accusations of bigotry. A particularly damaging point was a 2015 church policy (now reversed) that barred children of same-sex couples from baptism, which critics say exemplified punishing the innocent and drove many to leave in protest. The emotional toll of the Church’s rejection of LGBTQ identities – including higher risk of depression and suicide among LGBTQ Mormon youth – makes this one of the most passionately felt criticisms.
Evidence:

Policies and pronouncements: In November 2015, the Church implemented a policy labeling members in same-sex marriages as “apostates” (subject to excommunication) and forbidding their minor children from baptism or baby blessings until reaching adulthood under strict conditions. These rules effectively marginalized LGBTQ families. The move *“triggered widespread condemnations from LGBTQ members and their allies”* and led to a reported surge in membership resignations. One lifelong member, upon hearing that children would be denied blessings because of their gay parents, wrote, “It is impossible for me to be a part of a religion that would attack its own members and punish them by denying their children involvement in the church.” She and many others formally left over this “gratuitously cruel” policy. (The outcry was so intense that the Church rescinded this particular policy in 2019.)

Continued doctrine and its human impact: Even apart from the 2015 policy, LDS doctrine strictly proscribes homosexual conduct. Same-sex marriages are not recognized and those who engage in them or any same-sex intimacy are considered to be in serious sin. Church leaders continue to teach that homosexual feelings are not a sin but acting on them is, and that marriage is only between one man and one woman. In 2008 the LDS Church also campaigned in support of California’s Proposition 8 (banning gay marriage), which drew public criticism. Many LGBTQ members or those with LGBTQ family report feeling unsafe or unwelcome; sadly, Utah (which is majority LDS) has seen high suicide rates among LGBTQ youth, and critics link this to the church’s condemning stance. In a 2019 survey, 23% of former Mormons cited “the Church’s positions on LGBT issues” as a major reason for leaving.
LDS Defense: The Church’s leadership has tried to convey love for individuals while not budging on doctrine. They often state that God’s law of chastity (no sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage) cannot be changed, and thus same-sex marriage is not permissible. In April 2019, when the 2015 exclusion policy was reversed, the First Presidency reiterated that this change “does not represent a shift in doctrine” – homosexual relationships are still considered a “serious transgression”. However, the harsh “apostate” label was removed, and children of LGBTQ couples can now be blessed and baptized without special permission. Leaders like Dallin H. Oaks teach that we must love and respect everyone, “show more understanding, compassion and love,” but they also assert that true love means encouraging what they believe is God’s path. The Church has supported certain LGBT-inclusive measures (such as nondiscrimination laws in housing/employment) to show goodwill, but it maintains that it cannot condone same-sex marriages or behavior. In essence, the LDS Church’s defense is that it is following God’s commandments regarding marriage, even if unpopular, and that eternal truth (as they see it) is not determined by social change. Members are encouraged to be kind to LGBTQ individuals, and LGBTQ persons are welcome in the Church if they abide by the law of chastity (which for them entails celibacy). This stance, however, continues to be a primary point of contention for those who feel it causes needless suffering.



7. Role of Women and Gender Inequality
Criticism: The LDS Church is often criticized for relegating women to second-class status. Women cannot hold the priesthood (the Church’s lay clergy authority), meaning all ultimate decision-making and ritual power is in the hands of men. Ex-members argue that this patriarchal structure and the emphasis on traditional gender roles (women as mothers/homemakers) limit women’s opportunities and worth. The lack of female voices in top leadership and certain past teachings (for instance, women covenanting to “obey” husbands in temple ceremonies prior to recent changes) are seen as evidence that the Church’s system is sexist, which for many is unacceptable in the modern world.
Evidence:

No female priesthood authority: In the LDS Church, *“all positions of authority and leadership require ordination to the priesthood – and no women can be ordained”*. This means women cannot serve as bishops, stake presidents, apostles, or prophets – offices that define church governance. While women do lead auxiliary organizations (Relief Society, Young Women) and can serve missions, they do so under male oversight. There is no clear doctrinal explanation for why women are barred from priesthood, only a longstanding tradition. This institutional inequality has prompted efforts like the “Ordain Women” movement, whose founder Kate Kelly was excommunicated in 2014 simply for publicly advocating that women should be given the priesthood. The harsh response to those conversations reinforced the perception that women’s voices are not valued equally – Kelly noted that “silencing women has long been a top priority for patriarchal institutions,” and in her case, asking for equality was met with expulsion.

Impact on members: Many women (and men) struggle with the idea that God would deny women the same opportunities for leadership and direct spiritual authority. Female members perform vital service yet ultimately must defer to male priesthood holders for decisions and blessings. This dynamic has led to frustration and disillusionment. In one survey, 18% of former members said “the role of women in the Church” was a factor in their decision to leave. They point to policies like women not being allowed to witness baptisms until 2019, or never seeing a woman preach in the key Priesthood Session of general conference (until very recently), as signs that the Church does not truly treat women as equal partners.
LDS Defense: Church leaders vehemently reject the notion that women are second-class. They teach that men and women have different but complementary roles in God’s plan. As one apostle put it, *“men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood, but they are not the priesthood… men and women have different but equally valued roles.”* The late President Gordon B. Hinckley explained that this pattern was established by the Lord, not out of male chauvinism: *“it was the Lord, not man, who designated that men in His Church should hold the priesthood”*, and he noted that God endowed women with other capabilities to round out His organization. The Church often highlights that women lead the Relief Society (one of the largest women’s organizations in the world), teach and speak in meetings, serve missions, and have significant influence in council settings. Recent adjustments have also been made (for example, women can now serve as witnesses to ordinances, and the rhetoric in temple ceremonies has been adjusted to be more egalitarian). The official stance remains that the priesthood is not a “power grab” but a service role and that motherhood and other forms of nurturing are equally noble callings. Leaders say *“men and women are equal in God’s eyes… but equal does not mean the same”*, emphasizing that a difference in duties doesn’t imply female inferiority. They also state that only God can authorize a change in women’s ordination; until He does, they trust His wisdom in organizing the Church. In practice, the Church urges men to honor and listen to women. Any abuses or demeaning of women by LDS men are condemned as contrary to Christ’s teachings. While this defense doesn’t satisfy those who see inequity, faithful members (women included) often say they feel respected and that their contributions, though different, are valued equally in the eternal perspective.



8. “Cult-like” Control and Emphasis on Obedience
Criticism: Detractors frequently liken the LDS Church to a high-demand cult that prioritizes obedience to authority over personal autonomy. They argue that members are expected to conform in almost every aspect of life – from dress and diet to finances and family planning – based on directives from church leaders. Open questioning or criticism of those leaders is strongly discouraged. This culture of strict obedience and the expectation to “follow the prophet” no matter what is seen as unhealthy and authoritarian. It often leaves those who begin to doubt feeling that independent thinking is not truly allowed.
Evidence:

No criticism allowed: A well-known instruction in LDS culture is that one should never criticize Church leadership. In fact, Apostle Dallin H. Oaks flatly stated that *“it’s wrong to criticize leaders of the Church, even if the criticism is true.”* (emphasis added). Such a stance, critics say, stifles honest discussion and accountability. The quoted reasoning was that criticizing leaders undermines their authority as “servants of the Lord” – which exemplifies how unquestioning deference is cultivated. Many former members recall that voicing doubts about church teachings could bring social consequences or disciplinary action, creating an environment where they felt they had to “hide” unorthodox opinions.

High conformity expectations: The Church prescribes an extensive code of conduct: members are expected to follow a strict health code (no coffee, tea, alcohol), tithe 10% of their income, attend lengthy meetings and perform unpaid church duties weekly, adhere to a dress code (modest attire; temple-going adults wear special undergarments daily), and even follow counsel on intimate matters (e.g. discouraged from any premarital sexual activity, restrictions on LGBT members as discussed). While many religions have behavioral standards, ex-Mormons often report that in Mormonism the degree of life control is exceptionally high. As one metric, a survey of former Mormons found 21% cited “the Church’s emphasis on conformity and obedience” as a reason they left. People who leave often describe finally feeling “free” from constant judgment. Additionally, the Church’s intense focus on keeping members worthy (through personal interviews with bishops about private conduct, etc.) can feel invasive. These factors combined lead critics to label the faith “cultish” – not in the sense of extremism or violence, but in the sense of demanding total loyalty and engendering fear or guilt if one steps out of line.
LDS Defense: Devout members see the same facts very differently. The Church teaches that obedience is a virtue and a means of showing love to God. From an LDS perspective, commandments and counsel from leaders are there to bless and protect members (the analogy often used is that of loving parents setting rules for their children). It’s true that LDS leaders expect to be heeded, but they also frequently remind members that following is a choice made out of faith. Leaders argue that public criticism can sow doubt and disunity; as Oaks explained, it “diminishes [leaders’] effectiveness” in doing God’s work. Therefore, concerns should be raised through proper channels, not public forums. The Church also emphasizes personal agency: every teaching is to be confirmed by individual prayer and “personal revelation.” In theory, members are encouraged to gain their own spiritual witness of directives. Regarding lifestyle rules, faithful Latter-day Saints will say that things like the Word of Wisdom (health code) or law of chastity are commandments from God found in scripture – not arbitrary demands from men. Obedience to such commandments, even when difficult, is believed to bring spiritual strength and happiness. Lastly, the Church points out that it has millions of diverse members worldwide who live normal lives – working, educating, and mingling in society – which they argue is evidence that while the Church is structured and disciplined, it is not an isolationist cult. To believers, the strong community standards simply provide a supportive framework to help individuals be the best they can be in a morally confusing world.



9. Changing Doctrines and Prophetic Fallibility
Criticism: Another powerful argument is that if the LDS Church were led by prophets who speak for God, one would not expect to see major doctrinal U-turns or erroneous teachings – yet LDS history is replete with abandoned doctrines and “failed prophecies.” Former members point to examples like the Adam–God doctrine, the once-taught necessity of polygamy, or predictions about the Second Coming that didn’t materialize. These inconsistencies suggest to critics that LDS leaders were not actually guided by unerring revelation, but were simply men of their times. In their view, a true church would have a more consistent track record.
Evidence:

Adam–God Doctrine: A striking example is that Brigham Young (the second LDS prophet) taught that Adam was God – meaning Adam from the Bible was Heavenly Father in mortal form. He preached in the 1850s that “Adam is our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.” This Adam–God doctrine was even included in early temple ceremonies. However, the modern LDS Church has renounced this teaching. It is “rejected by the LDS Church today,” which classifies it as a false theory. For a critic, the obvious question is: how could a true prophet of God teach something so fundamentally wrong about the identity of God? If Brigham Young erred on such a grand scale (essentially preaching heresy by today’s LDS standards), it calls into question the reliability of prophetic guidance.

Reversals on “eternal” doctrines: Other shifts include the requirement of plural marriage for exaltation – taught in the 19th century as essential for the highest salvation, then later reversed (the Church now bans polygamy). The priesthood ban on Blacks was once defended as God’s unchangeable will (with leaders claiming it would persist until perhaps the Millennium), yet in 1978 that too changed. These about-faces can be deeply disconcerting. Even LDS apostle Bruce R. McConkie, after the 1978 racial change, admitted that “previous statements [by leaders]” on the topic were based on limited understanding and “had been removed” by new revelation. To a disillusioned member, that’s effectively saying prophets taught wrong ideas for over a century. Furthermore, there have been prophetic statements about timelines that proved incorrect (for example, early leaders in the 1830s prophesied that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, or that a temple would be built in Independence, Missouri within that generation 【footnote】D&C 84:2-5【/footnote】 – things which did not happen as declared). Such instances accumulate to suggest a pattern of human fallibility inconsistent with the claim of near-infallible modern prophets.
LDS Defense: The Church’s response is that continuing revelation is a core tenet of Mormonism – God reveals his will “line upon line, precept upon precept.” This means doctrine may be clarified or additional knowledge given as needed. What critics call contradictions, faithful members often call updates or corrections from God. For example, the ending of polygamy or the priesthood ban are framed not as God changing His mind, but as the Lord revealing a new directive appropriate for that time (in 1890 and 1978 respectively). Leaders readily acknowledge that prophets are mortal. As President Uchtdorf said, “leaders in the church have made mistakes” and teachings or policies may have reflected human limitations. The Church draws a distinction between core doctrine (which they claim has never changed – e.g. belief in Christ, the plan of salvation) and smaller matters of policy or speculation which can change. In the case of Brigham Young’s Adam–God teaching, modern apologists label it a “misunderstood” or personal theory that was never officially adopted as Church doctrine. They note that subsequent prophets like Spencer W. Kimball explicitly re-asserted that Adam is not God, re-centering LDS doctrine. The broader defense is that God allows his prophets to lead the Church but doesn’t dictate every word – so sometimes leaders may express personal opinions that aren’t correct, which later get corrected. The principle of prophetic fallibility is now openly taught: LDS leaders are not infallible, and only the President of the Church, when speaking officially, is believed to be guiding the whole Church with God’s authority. Even then, members believe revelation comes according to the readiness of the people. So from a believer’s perspective, changes like 1978’s are signs of divine direction (God lifting earlier restrictions) rather than proof that the Church isn’t true. They see it as the Church becoming closer to what God wants as the members become ready to accept more (a process that will continue). In sum, Latter-day Saints trust that despite some past errors, the overarching course of the Church is directed by Jesus Christ, and they are willing to live with some ambiguity or past mistakes in doctrine, just as one sees in the Bible with early apostles who didn’t grasp everything at once.



10. Exclusive Truth Claims and “One True Church” Attitude
Criticism: The LDS Church teaches that it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (a claim originating in its scripture 【footnote】Doctrine & Covenants 1:30【/footnote】). To ex-members and atheists, this assertion of exclusive truth comes across as arrogant and implausible. Many who leave Mormonism come to believe that no single religion has a monopoly on truth and goodness. They point out that people of other faiths (or no faith) can live virtuous lives, feel the divine, and have valid spiritual experiences. Therefore, the LDS claim that it alone has the authority to act in God’s name – and that saving ordinances performed elsewhere are invalid – is seen as insular and unsupported. This exclusivism can also strain relationships, as active members may view those outside the Church (including family) as lacking full truth, leading to judgments that critics find unjustified.
Evidence:

Many former members describe a shift in perspective where they no longer accept the idea of “one true church.” In a recent study, 36.5% of ex-Mormons said that a major reason for leaving was *“I stopped believing there was one true church.”* This indicates how prevalent rejection of the exclusivity claim is among those who leave. They often cite that morally and spiritually, the LDS Church doesn’t appear superior to other churches – it has scandals and fallible leaders like any institution. Additionally, the uniform truth claim rings hollow when LDS doctrine itself has changed over time (as discussed above). If the LDS Church were uniquely guided by God, critics ask, why do its teachings evolve and why do its members not demonstrably fare better than others? The rise of a more pluralistic view of spirituality has led many away from the rigid idea that any one church could be “the only true” one.

Critics also note that the LDS missionary message inherently invalidates other faiths by claiming authority for itself. For example, converts are taught that priesthood authority was lost after the early apostles and only restored through Joseph Smith. This means ordinances (like baptism or communion) in other churches are not recognized by LDS authorities. Such a stance does not sit well with those who value religious pluralism. It can appear disrespectful toward the sincere faith of billions of non-Mormons. Some who leave Mormonism describe feeling relief in shedding the belief that they belong to a supremely “chosen” organization – a belief they later see as a kind of indoctrination. Instead, they adopt a view that goodness and truth can be found in many places and that no single church can corner the market on God.
LDS Defense: From its founding, the LDS Church has unabashedly proclaimed itself the restoration of Christ’s original Church, holding exclusive authority (priesthood keys) conferred by heavenly messengers. Leaders continue to affirm this. However, they are careful to also acknowledge that other religions have much truth and do much good. The Church’s official stance is that all people have a portion of God’s light and that other Christian denominations and faiths contain truth – just not the fullness of the gospel. The concept of the “only true church” is thus explained by saying that God’s priesthood authority to perform saving ordinances (like baptism) resides only in the LDS Church, and that the full doctrine of Christ (including temple ceremonies, additional scripture, etc.) is found there. Latter-day Saint leaders often stress that this claim is not meant to denigrate others, but to explain the need for the Restoration. They encourage members to show respect for other faiths and work alongside them in common causes. As for why the LDS Church believes it can claim exclusive truth: the defense ultimately rests on spiritual conviction. Members pray and receive what they interpret as divine confirmation that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and that the Church is God’s kingdom on earth. With that spiritual witness, they accept the bold claim of exclusivity in a humble manner (ideally not as a license to boast, but as a call to serve). In practical terms, the Church teaches that more will be revealed and that eventually the “only true church” will encompass all truth. Until then, they see their role as sharing what they believe is a uniquely authoritative message – even if that stance is unpopular in a relativistic age. For those who have left, of course, these assertions fail to persuade; but faithful Latter-day Saints feel that the fruits of their religion (personal spiritual experiences, a strong community, continuing revelation) substantiate its divine authority despite any imperfections.

A Dash: leaps forward, stomping when he lands.



A Down: pokes the ground with his hook



A Up: swings the blade overhead



Air Neutral: spins around with both arms strung out



Air Forward: slams down his blade



Air Back: spins and swipes with the hook



Air Up: swings hook overhead



Air Down: dives down in a belly flop



Charge Smash Side: holds up a huge block of stone before slamming it down



Charge Smash Up: Holds up his arm and spins the blades string like a lasso.



Charge Smash Down: sends out his blade as he spins, sweeping it along the ground on either side.



Grab A: roars in the foe's face.



Throw Forward: headbutts the foe away



Throw Back: swings the foe in a circle before spiking them at the ground



Throw Up: Lets the hook fly loose before swinging upward to lash the foe away.



Throw Down: jumps on the foe's head, burying them.



Up Taunt: raises his hook with a roar



Side Taunt: coughs up a key, coffee bean, or something else. like Pac-Man's gallery



Down Taunt: takes on the thinker pose like his statue



B Moves: (What will your fighters B special moves be?)



Normal B: Monty (gravedigger calls fellow a fellow undead phobie, murderwing! The little skull thing peels itself back before launching itself at the nearest foe in a weak homing. If you were to press the button again before the shot, though, Gravedigger would smack Murderwing instead, launching him harder for more damage in exchange for losing the homing effect. This move has a long cooldown.



Side B: dual RIP (his actual in-game attack, Gravedigger swings both arms down, sending one of his limbs flying; tapping the button sends out the hook, which doesn't do a lot of damage but has a far length, and holding it sends out the blade, which hits hard but is super slow with below-average range).



Down B: terrrorform (Gravedigger summons a statue of himself, which acts as a wall absorbing damage and exploding upon taking enough; Gravedigger can also break it back down by using the move again while next to it; if used in the air, the statue will fall straight down like the rock it is).



Up B: dimensional dive (when a dimensional monster is defeated, a black hole appears; Gravedigger summons one of these holes, which he uses to teleport; if you're too close to Gravedigger, you will be teleported along with him and take a pretty nasty hit in the process).



Final Smash: Voltage Gallery (Gravedigger stomps the ground, summoning the vault, which lets off a big flash, pulling anyone caught in it into a cinematic where the foes are surrounded by the gravedigger's statues before Eratic leaps onto the field, blasting its electricity through the statues, each one connecting in a massive shocking web, which all conjoins in the center, giving the unlucky enemies the zap of a lifetime! Also, just for the hell of it, if you end a battle with this move, it shows a heart getting popped, which Graveddigger slowly stomps over to and lets off a roar of victory as other starting phobies run around behind him.



Victory Poses: (How will your fighter celebrate their victory?)



Option 1: A statue is seen before it gets up, revealing it was actually a gravedigger, seeming annoyed for having the camera in his face.



Option 2: Keys litter the ground before the camera looks up to show the gravedigger looming over...



Option 3: Lippy creeps around taunting the viewers before the gravedigger stomps into view with a popped enemy heart on his hook.",1,1743914898.0,SmashBrosUltimate,0,1.0,False

To be clear: no one is calling me the asshole, I'm just interested if I'm being one.

So I live with a roommate, we've been friends for over a decade now, he's one of my best friends. Admittedly we are both a bit messy, so that's fine. The issue is, I don't cook almost at all, and other than when I have coffee in the house (I usually don't) I hardly ever use a single dish. My roommate cooks occasionally, but not for both of us, mostly for him and his girlfriend. Every once in a while he will offer me food (which I greatly appreciate). The thing is he fills up the sink with dishes, and even when he eventually fills up the dishwasher (which is long in between) he immediately completely fills the sink again. He also often leaves a lot of clutter on the counters. 

I buy most of our essentials out of pocket (toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, shower stuff, and usually the cat food and cat litter as well), and responsible for paying the rent (we split it but it's on me to get the check and what not) and I share the responsibility id say fairly evenly of cleaning the rest of the shared spaces. 

AITA for feeling kinda justified in thinking it's not as much my responsibility to clean the kitchen? Sometimes I still do. For a while I was doing all the cleaning more often, and for a while he was. Lately the kitchen mostly sits in a state of disrepair and the rest of the house is somewhat evenly split on cleaning. 


Added context: I have a lot of out of home responsibilities, I'm home basically just to sleep 90% of the time, he works part time and is there a good portion of the day and on his days off.

#Theodoros Kalotinis 

⭕️Theodoros Kalotinis is a Greek artisan perfumer from Heraklion, Crete. His journey to becoming a self-made perfumer is a testament to his hard work and skill, ultimately leading him to secure a personal patent for his unique fragrances. With a thirst for knowledge, he refined his craft in Grasse and studied cosmetology at a Greek university. 

⭕️Later in 2014, established the first Greek house of artisanal perfume. There is a story of how Vogue & Elle characterise him as “The king of Gourmand”, rightfully so, he has a knack to capture photorealistic scents of desserts. A title that may be self-proclaimed, but I'll let you decide how fitting it truly is. However, the brand truly blossomed in 2018 when Theodoros had the honor of creating personal perfumes for none other than King Charles and Queen Camilla. This royal endorsement catapulted his reputation, and since then, the brand has gradually expanded its presence around the globe

##Collections 
According to Fragrantica, there are a total of about 28 releases from Theodoros Kalotinis, although I found 24 fragrances currently listed on their website. These fragrances are categorized into two collections:

**+Eau de Parfum Collection** — 17 releases, offering an affordable range of fragrances.

**+Golden Secret Collection** — 7 releases, representing a premium selection.

This structured approach is one of the best IMO, as it allows a diverse audience to enjoy the fragrances, catered from everyday wear to luxurious statements, all while maintaining a clear price distinction & avoiding unnecessary confusions. I hope the brand carries on following this structure in the future too. 

#COFFEE ADDICT 

This fragrance belongs to their “Eau de Parfum Collection” and features a rich coffee base. Rather than taking a straightforward **“coffee”** route, the perfumer took a gourmand approach, blending the coffee notes with indulgent elements creating a warm & inviting scent.

##Packaging & Presentation 

🎁 Just love the minimalistic approach the brand took with the packaging. The 50ml bottle comes in a sleek black paperboard box adorned with white fonts displaying the brand name, concentration, and size details. A sticker seal covers the top of the box, featuring the fragrance name. 

🎁 The bottle itself is a simple cuboidal design made of generic glass, topped with a somewhat flimsy cap, and it features black, minimalistic label. The atomizer works adequately, though its spray and distribution might not match those of many commercial brands.

🎁  What I find particularly clever is that all of their fragrances shares this box design, with just a straightforward switch of the sticker for labeling the fragrance name. This resourceful approach showcases a consistent aesthetic across the collection.

#How it smells? 

☕️ The fragrance opens with a robust blend of coffee and caramel. The coffee note is photorealistic, but instead of capturing a ""raw coffee"" aroma, it evokes the essence of **instant coffee preparation** with milk and sugar. The closest comparison I can make is to whipped **Dalgona coffee**. 

☕️ More than the coffee, the **caramel note feels photorealistic**, beautifully capturing its sickly sweet, candy-like, warm, and lactonic nuances. While I understand that coffee aromas can vary significantly depending on the roast *(I've referenced a medium roast here)* the coffee in this fragrance doesn't evoke the scent of dark roasted beans. It lacks the earthy and smoky characteristics typically associated with a dark roast, instead leaning more toward the **nutty and chocolatey** profile of a medium roast, which perfectly complements the overall gourmand experience.

☕️ The fragrance remains quite linear throughout its wear. The primary difference I noticed is that while the vanilla is subdued in the initial phases, it gradually emerges as the scent dries down. This subtle transition adds a layer of depth without altering the overall character. But even with all that, the fragrance doesn’t smell expensive, honestly it **comes across smelling cheap**.

☕️ Coffee is undeniably the star of the show but also behaves as one, steals the show in initial phases & early dry-down then suddenly leaves the shoot & crew for unknown reasons. In the late dry-down, the coffee presence diminishes significantly, giving way to the dominant caramel and vanilla notes, which shine with their **toffee-like nuances and added lactonic facets**. Which continues till the death of the fragrance. 

##Undecorated Breakdown 

⭕️ If you’re looking for the aroma of freshly roasted coffee, this fragrance is not that. It takes a different route, leaning more toward instant coffee. It smells **immature & playful.**  It evokes a photorealistic Dalgona coffee with a hint of nutty caramel. For the fancy among us, it resembles a Caramel Iced Latte; and for millennials, it brings to mind **“Kopiko”** toffee but amplified 10x . The scent is so vivid that it will almost make you feel like you’re holding a cup of coffee (depends on your pick) in your hand.

>A fraghead on fragrantica mentions “I do like it but wish the sweetness could be dialed back just a bit”. 

>Another fraghead says “Very realistic latte with Caramel scent like you smell the drink itself” 

>One says “this one just smells like a stale day long cup of American coffee that turned a bit sour, with extra sugar.”

>Another one mentions “the opening strongly reminds me of tiramisu”.

>One more mentions “This smells like a Starbucks Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino”

Other than last comment I agree with most of them, wtf???? is a ribbon crunch anyway!!!!! 😂😂😂 


#Performance 

##Longevity 
🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑

##Projection 
🌕🌕🌗🌑🌑

##Compliment factor 
🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑

The longevity is more than enough for my needs. It lasts 6–7hrs on skin, even more on clothes, has a tight—moderate bubble of projection. And let’s be honest, who can resist the allure of a coffee scent? I assume its charm will make it a crowd-pleaser. 

##When & Where, For Whom?

⛅️ Although this can be worn all season, I definitely don’t recommend wearing it in our kind of summer. This can easily become a chocking hazard ⚠️. The right time for this fragrance is colder seasons & cooler evenings. It will cocoon you with its warm cozy coffee. 

⛅️ This has “Date night” written all over it. But I can assure it is versatile. Whether you're enjoying an evening stroll, catching up with friends, indulging in a home spa day, or getting lost in a good book, it’s got you covered. Please don’t wear it if the date is in day time, you gonna choke yourself. 

⛅️ As for its gender profile, it leans a touch feminine, mainly because there aren’t many well-known gourmands that appeal to men. And let’s face it, wearing a fragrance that evokes coffee can come off as a bit playful. If you’re a serious typa guy, you might want to steer clear!. 

>I can totally picture someone in their mid-20s to mid-30s, with a serious hangover, sitting in a conference with dark sunglasses on, desperately trying to mask how wired their are are from all that caffine.

###That’s the inspiration behind the photograph. 

##Similarities with other fragrances

This fragrance offers a truly unique, photorealistic take on a gourmand coffee. However, there are a few others in the same realm worth noting:
1. Al-Rehab’s French Coffee
2. Kerosene Followed
3. Akro Awake
While each of these has its distinct character, they all share that delightful coffee gourmand base. 

#Verdict 

🏅This is one of the best budget-friendly, photorealistic coffee scents available. The gourmand blend of coffee with caramel and vanilla evokes the delightful aroma of Dalgona coffee or Kopiko toffee.

🏅However, it does come off as somewhat cheaply made, primarily due to its lack of complexity and a rather generic fragrance structure. It leans towards the feminine side, reflecting a playful character with the sweetness often associated with these types of coffees.

🏅On the plus side, it offers decent longevity and projection, making it a solid option for those looking for an accessible coffee fragrance.

#TL;DR :

TK Coffee Addict smells like photo-realistic “Kopiko” toffee/ Dalgona coffee. This is a unisex fragrance, leaning feminine. The fragrance lasts incredibly long. Technically, it’s an expertly crafted scent. However, one flaw completely annihilates it — **“It smells cheap!!!”.**

1jsm1o5,https://officeoutlaw.com,OfficeOutlaw.com – The Workplace Renegade You Didn’t Know You Needed,"[OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com) – The Workplace Renegade You Didn’t Know You Needed



Let’s get one thing straight: working in an office is basically a socially acceptable way to slowly disintegrate while wearing khakis. Between the soul-sapping fluorescent lights, the symphony of passive-aggressive Slack messages, and Linda from accounting who chews gum like she’s angry at it, it’s a miracle any of us make it to Friday without flipping a desk.



Enter [OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com), the digital rebel with a stapler holster. This isn’t your average office supply store or one of those “10 ways to Feng Shui your cubicle” blogs. No, Office Outlaw is what happens when caffeine, chaos, and corporate rebellion have a baby. A beautiful, slightly unhinged baby with a label maker and zero regard for office politics.



What Is OfficeOutlaw.com?

Imagine if your favorite sarcastic co-worker made a website dedicated to breaking the chains of office monotony and helping you look good doing it. That’s Office Outlaw. It’s a site for the rule-breakers, the Zoom call lurkers, the keyboard warriors who play Solitaire like it’s a competitive sport. Office Outlaw is for anyone who has ever wanted to send an email with the subject line “Why Are We Still Here?” and actually mean it.



But it’s not just comedy gold (although, yes, it is hysterical). It’s also a resource. A tool. A weapon, even. If you're trying to build a business, brand yourself in a boring industry, or create the kind of digital empire that would make your boss say, “Wait, you’re quitting to do that full time?”—then this site is your new homepage.



Who’s Behind This Madness?

You’d think it was a team of eccentric billionaires with ergonomic chairs made of rare alpaca fur. But no. It’s run by a mysterious, caffeine-fueled human (or possibly a hyper-intelligent raccoon in a tie) who knows everything about online business, marketing psychology, and how to make money without losing your mind or selling your soul to a pyramid scheme.



This outlaw doesn’t follow traditional business rules like “start slow” or “play it safe.” Nope. They’re out here yelling, “Build the funnel! Fire the clients! And post that weird TikTok, Karen, it’s branding!”



What You’ll Find on [OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com)

Here’s what makes this site different from all those boring “10 Habits of Successful Entrepreneurs” blog posts that were probably written by someone who thinks The 4-Hour Workweek is a fantasy novel.



💥 Funnels Without the Fluff

Forget the complicated sales funnels that make you feel like you need a PhD in spreadsheet wizardry. Office Outlaw breaks it down like a friend who’s had just enough margarita to be dangerously helpful. It’s like:



Step 1: Attract humans.

Step 2: Don’t be boring.

Step 3: Sell something cool.

Step 4: Make money. Repeat. Maybe buy a yacht. Or socks. Your call.



🧠 Copywriting That Slaps

Ever read a landing page and thought, “Wow, I’ve never wanted to nap and unsubscribe at the same time”? Yeah, not here. This site is filled with lessons, tips, and actual examples that’ll teach you how to write copy that doesn’t suck. We’re talking:



Email subject lines that get clicked.



Headlines that slap you in the face (with value).



Buttons that scream “click me” without sounding desperate.



🦸‍♂️ Rebellion With a Business Plan

[OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com) is for people who want to build a business that looks nothing like your dad’s real estate agency. It’s for weirdos. Creatives. Side-hustlers who refuse to die at a desk. You’ll learn how to:



Brand yourself so people remember you (for good reasons).



Use automation without turning into a robot.



Escape the 9-to-5 using clever strategy and a bit of unhinged charm.



Why It’s Better Than Therapy

Look, therapy is great. But sometimes what you really need isn’t another “how does that make you feel?” It’s a blog post that says, “Here’s how to quit your job, start an online business, and still have enough time to nap like a medieval peasant.” That’s what [OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com) gives you: hope, humor, and a to-do list with no HR approval needed.



Plus, the tone? Absolutely unprofessional—in the best possible way. Think: if a pirate captain became a business coach and still made you hit your KPIs. You’ll laugh, you’ll learn, and you’ll probably want to redesign your life using memes, which honestly sounds healthier than whatever your manager suggested in last quarter’s performance review.



Some Highlight-Worthy Shenanigans

Just in case you’re not convinced (which is shocking, because this article is clearly Pulitzer-worthy), here’s a taste of the wild content you’ll find:



“How to Fire Your Clients Without Crying (Much)” – because sometimes the real villain is the one asking for just one more revision.



“The 7 Types of People on Zoom and How to Emotionally Survive Them” – spoiler: Chad with the leaf blower always wins.



“Your Funnel Sucks and Here’s Why” – tough love meets internet gold.



“Be a Brand, Not a Boring Blob” – if your LinkedIn bio reads like a dusty resume, prepare for a rude awakening.



Who’s It For?

Let’s play a little game. If you:



Have a business (or want to).



Are allergic to boring.



Hate fake hustle bros with rented Lambos.



Secretly dream of never attending another Monday meeting again…



Congratulations. You are officially an Office Outlaw. No paperwork required. Just show up, be weird, and take notes.



Final Thoughts (or Whatever)

[OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com) isn’t here to coddle you or pretend like success is all vision boards and good vibes. It’s here to hand you a keyboard, a coffee, and a sarcastic slap on the back while yelling, “Let’s build something ridiculous and profitable.”



It’s the anti-guru guru. The business school with bad manners. The digital hideout for those of us who know we were never meant to die in a cubicle.



So go ahead. Grab your stapler like it’s Excalibur. Log on to [OfficeOutlaw.com](http://OfficeOutlaw.com) and start building a business so rebellious, even your printer will respect you.



Stay weird. Stay caffeinated. And for the love of Linda, don’t forward that all-staff email.



Let me know if you want a shorter version, or one with more sass, less sass, more businessy stuff, or maybe a full-blown western showdown theme (Outlaws, remember?).

We know that we’re for some reason going back to White shirts despite the fact that industry standard has been all black for years at this point. This is similar to that of OLD OG uniforms but, with jeans instead? I find that to be two steps backwards honestly. Employees will be a lot less uniform because of these changes, giving an uncoordinated look. Is that what Corporate is looking forward to? First they force Ziosks which gives employees multiple things to be wary of to ensure employment and continued scheduling, while the Ziosk either doesn’t work half the time or guests can’t be bothered to read thoroughly enough to really provide accurate feedback. Not to mention that if they hide or keep it out of reach, it leads to awkward interactions or our scores dropping (which we get punished for)! For the longest time Olive Garden has been trying to force itself into this image of what I’d call faux fine dining, where the service provided of unlimited starters, fast delivery of food items, and plenty of other points of service all would wrap together and ensure the guest experience is more than what they paid for. But forcing the Ziosks and then new uniforms that look tacky and undercooked brings cause for concern and honestly feels like it shatters the illusion Darden has been trying to force into OG. Anyone else feel this way? Anyone else disappointed in all the stress corporate is putting onto servers while refusing to fix or replace or update equipment pieces in multiple locations that could ACTUALLY ensure smooth and prompt service? I understand a lot of employees can handle all these tasks and thrive, but those that can’t are left feeling overworked and burn out, leading to higher turnover rate and Darden can’t seem to put 2 + 2 together, because numbers and sales increases is more important than the guest and employee experience. At my location we haven’t had more than 6 saucers in months and find ourselves using appetizer plates just so we could serve tea or coffee at times, I understand we’re back ordered but it’s crazy the things this company will prioritize, over ensuring that employees can actually do their jobs. I’ve found myself in more awkward conversations than I’d like to admit regarding those Ziosks, especially if somehow the guests or host team mix them up in the middle of your shift and suddenly manager intervention is needed. I’d like to hear from you all: What are things your location won’t seem to fix or do anything about while you’re finding yourselves with more on your plates?

It’s not court ordered and they could easily change that. But anyway, when he’s here I will cook for SS, help with homework, have dinner together, watch a show and be generally nice to him but I like to do my own thing when he’s around. 

SO wants me to act more like a family. He doesn’t want me to get up and leave when SS is here. Sometimes I don’t but most of the time I do. SO also pointed out that I always move away when he’s cuddling with me and then SS cuddles with SO.

To be clear, I’m not asking if they like them enough to never harm them because I know that, due to instincts and differences in fragility, humans who keep big cats are more than likely to be harmed someday. 

Instead, what I am asking is: do the big cats like or “generally enjoy” interacting with the specific individuals who happen to be their trainers, show partners, veterinarians, handlers etc? 

Or, do big cats not relate to each other in that way, and therefore do not relate to humans in that way? If so, is it more of a “I enjoy your presence” kind of way? Sort of how someone may enjoy the person who rings up their cup of coffee at the local coffee shop every morning, or their neighbor’s dog that always runs next to their car when they drive by their house in the morning or something like that)?

If not, then is it more like “I don’t mind your presence, for now”?

He has not initiated really any physical contact besides like a hug goodbye on our dates. Hasn’t really “flirted” a whole lot or complimented me either. We’ve texted every day since our first date and he always says how great of a time he had with me but that’s pretty much the extent of it.

For context, I’ve never really dated anyone like ever so this is all very new to me. Hence why I also haven’t really been initiating things as much because I have no idea what I’m doing to be quite honest. I appreciate him taking things slow I guess but at some point I’m starting to question if he actually likes me and feel like the relationship isn’t necessarily progressing. I think we both might just but shy and newer to this type of dating (we met on a dating app).

I feel like because our dates have been in public places, it would be beneficial for us to have a date in a more private setting just the two of us. I currently live with my parents so I can’t really invite him over but I also feel weird about basically inviting myself over to his place lol (he lives alone).

I just feel like if we do another sit down date or something nothing is going to progress. I just don’t want this to fizzle out because one of us was too scared to make a move.",3,1743913089.0,dating_advice,15,0.71,False

Remember when the stock market used to open at 9:30 AM and that was it? Now, it feels like a whole new game where you can trade when *you* want, not just when the market decides to let you.

I’ve been using this platform that’s fully on-chain. That means no middlemen, no delays, and certainly no waiting for some arbitrary opening bell. Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or even real estate, it’s all available at any time. I literally woke up this morning, grabbed my coffee, and *boom* – trading before I even had time to finish my first cup.

It’s kinda wild how much freedom this opens up. I’m not stuck in the traditional market hours anymore. Trading is on my terms, no market hours needed. Oh, and it’s all transparent. No hidden fees, no third parties taking their cut – just you, the market, and the blockchain.

Anyone else here digging the whole ""no market hours"" vibe? Would love to hear your thoughts on trading beyond the usual 9-5 schedule.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/whiterock\_fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiterock_fi) ",1,1743912929.0,Crypto_Talkers,0,1.0,False
