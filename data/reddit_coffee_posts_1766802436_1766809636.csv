1pwolkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1pwolkn/help_me_navigate_through_the_chaos_male_with/,Help me navigate through the chaos (male with pwBPD ex),"I have gone through my toughest most loving relationship and eventual breakup, I've only just now found this reddit group that I hope can become my group therapy. And I say that because I can't get why this relationship has affected me so bad. I should mention I am a bipolar depression sufferer (leaning heavily on the depressive side).

I'm sorry in advance for the chaotic text, as it reflects my internal state and is a mix of my notes and details I added for this post.

It started this summer when I went out with an acquaintance who introduced me to new people after not having seen him in a while. One of them was my BPD ex. Not physically attractive which is a huge contrast to me as I am a genuinely very attractive male. I am also older than her. The moment I appeared, she looked at me and I felt her eyes penetrating my soul, as if she was saying ""I see you"" on some deeper level. For some reason, I found this bonding affecting me a lot and I couldn't get her out of my head. The following days I would drive her and her friend from their villages to the town we hung out with the rest of the guys. I also have to mention that to see them I was driving 50km away while also getting them and at the end of the night dropping them off to their places (her and her soon to be best friend mostly but others as well).

After knowing each other withing the bounds of the company and hanging out several nights in a row, almost after 3 weeks, I confessed my admiration to her over text. She seemed to act ecstatic, telling me how she can't believe it and she was so incredibly happy, asking ""why me"" and generally texting a lot on the group chat, calling the other girl I was driving along with her to where we hung out, and so on. She told me she wanted to see me, ""let's have a coffee in the morning (it was already 5am), let's drive somewhere and talk and be together"". I think this was genuine. She was the sensitive girl, the musician artsy girl with the soft voice I fell in love with. I have to believe that for my own sanity.

We did go out, I drove to the twon we would hang out and went for a coffee, a common male friend that would play a pivotal role later joined us as well. This morning already I was feeling drained, as I had no sleep since all I did was drive and be with her either on the phone or physically. So even with her alone there, I started feeling like I had done a mistake. Not so much about the age difference but more about her showing insecurities. She was saying to that friend and me how she wanted to have multiple more tattoos and piercings, in basically every place of her face and body, even the sensitive parts, get a split tongue and so on. I was finding that a bit gruesome and I couldn't not say anything, she replied she might not split her tongue. She would have so much energy while I was so exhausted. I drove back sleepless that day. 

At some point, that day later or the day earlier, I can't pinpoint it exactly because my memory is so fragmented from the constant lack of sleep these days, she had told me actually that maybe it's not a good idea to start a relationship because she isn't ready. She felt the distance (she would go to a far away town for studies), the age difference and her psychological issues she had to deal with would be essential problems. I then felt relief somehow, as if okay at least she wanted me but I also didn't feel ready. But my mistake was I didn't say that. Instead, I said okay no problems, I'm happy we are friends and this changes nothing. When she saw it, she flipped again and actually now did want a relationship. So because I was also ambivalent, I went along.

We hung out multiple evenings in my car before I dropped her off at her village, stayed up until the morning few times. Once it was so early in the morning and i was so sleepy that I couldn't find my way back. One of those nights she asked me ""so what are we now?"". To which I replied ""well we're together, right?"". Remember that, this will matter later.

We had been together for about 2 weeks and even on the first days I felt this was burdening me a lot. I have a job that requires a lot of intense mental focus and I couldn't afford such long breaks from it. I am a developer. I was actually waiting for her to leave for her studies so I can start working. Which happened so. We would call the first days but then I started working more and more. After about 3 weeks, she came back, to visit me (that's what she told me). One of the nights we hung out she told me after she left for her studies I had changed and felt like I was avoiding her. She also told me something about her having trouble with guys getting fed up with her perhaps.

Then I made the mistake to talk to that common friend about my trouble with the relationship, how I felt pressure and how I actually didn't want something serious at that point in my life. Another girl was there that showed interest and I also told him that but because he wanted to go out with her he maybe kept that as a threat. But this conversation will come up later after the breakup. 

The relationship goes through strain with a lot of push pull dynamic, me pushing her away but her pulling me back somehow, saying ""why don't you say you love me lately, you don't give me validation"" triggered some kind of anxiety in me that led me to drive 350km all the way to her place the next day and stay for a few days like she wanted.

Fast forward, it wasn't going well and I was growing even more distant to manage my work which wasn't going well at that point. One night, we had a conversation on the phone where I was feeling very depressed but didn't feel safe to say anything about that, she told me she has BPD and that it really affected her bad. I refused to talk about why I also feel bad because I said I don't believe the couple should share bad experiences only, I don't see it that way. Well, she was.

The following night I was going out to the nearby town to see the common friends, the breakdown happened. She called her best friend. The common friend that I talked to about me feeling pressured about the relationship was there. My ex was crying on the phone and he probably took the phone to talk to her. 

He told her things about me based on what I had made the mistake to confide. She then sends me a break up message. I was ready to breakup that moment, it even felt good that moment. I was accused by that friend that I wasn't serious in the relationship and was looking at other women. On the phone with my ex, later, our fight was basically that I fooled her for 3 months into a seemingly serious relationship while I was looking also at other people and she wasn't. But three weeks later, after waiting for her to come to her town nearby from where she studies in order to give her some stuff I fixed that were at my place (I had promised to fix them), I started missing her and even requested to see her. She refused saying we have nothing to say. ""I only want my stuff"", ""if we're gonna play games just send it on my expense""... she told me to write what i wanted to say in the chat. I wrote her an apology message and told her how much I've always admired her, to which she just replied ""ok"" and if she wanted her stuff so bad, I'll just drive all the way to her town to give it to her, just for that. ""Ok"" again. After several hours i got angry and deleted the apology message. We just set up the meeting and so I brought her her stuff. That happened yesterday (now 6 days ago). She was with the guys that now hang out only with her, and they even greeted me kindly. She even said ""thank you"" with a sweet voice! Then she blocked me from all accounts apart from tiktok and from one which she only removed me from her followers and kept following me. And now I'm left with a huge void, I even started crying. I never cry! I'm sad all the time and can't give a reasonable explanation to all this. 

After almost a week away from the block, reading up on BPD and watching loads of youtube videos about the condition, I still don't understand why this happened. Why was I attracted to this. I feel like I lost part of my life, like I threw all my care and love, because I did love her, to a void. I remember how ice cold the look on her face was the last time we saw each other after a stupid fight. She had held a grudge about me thinking I do not find her attractive based on a comment I had made yesterday about her shaved eyebrows... i found her real eyebrows much prettier than the drawn ones. She held it as a grudge and gave me the middle finger the next day before we went out as partly a joke but I took it seriously and got angry. I was already fed up. She was banging her head on the walls earlier because she couldn't deal with her parents... 
That's when I saw it. The ice cold persona that would avert her eyes and act like a stranger. She was totally different, walking slowly and confidently, this was not the fragile girl I fell in love with. On the 40 minute drive back and forth she would not look at me or say a word, while I was constantly checking up on her. She was looking outside and even sat in a way that was facing the car door. When we came back after a while she split back again, hugged me out of nowhere and was back to her innocent self.

I should mention that sex with her was impossible because the 2 successful times we did have out of 4 in total, she would cry afterwards telling me that she had flashbacks of her rape trauma. I couldn't maintain an erection with her, while this has never happened to me before. 

Please someone, what's the best explanation you can give to this? Why did she block me from her main and her photography account and only removed me as a follower from her more secretive account but kept following me? Why did she keep me as a friend on tiktok and hasn't blocked me from her discord server? Why do I feel I want to understand her? Also why are our common friends by her side? Nobody has texted me since. They all avoid me.

Why did i switch from indifference and actual relief that she brought the end of the relationship and not me because I fearing the chaos, to actually now creating internal chaos by missing her? The thing i miss the most was our hugs. She was so affectionate. I could sleep so peacefully next to her but only the first day we would meet. Because the next days i would start feeling irritated and wanted my space.
What made me feel weird with her but i think was the thing that also drove me in was her ability to disassociate with impactful melancholic music. We even decided to cover a couple songs together. ",1,1766809476.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I need your advice and I really hope you can help me with some tips.

I have been married for 4 years now, no kids yet. I live out side my home country with husband.

I usually visit once a year and spend a few months with family, my husband doesn't get that much time off from work, so he visit only for a few weeks.

Now to the topic, I have a good taste in clothes and usually get everyone some small gifts when i visit, this is not because i live abroad, but values that my parents have given me. My in laws are not like this, they expect gift, but wont give themselves.

In the beginning I used to get very upset because my love language is gifting but now i have come to a realisation that its not the same for everyone.

my younger SIL is getting married next year and im hoping to give her some gifts but my elder SIL who is married with 3 kids and recently built her a house is very greedy. She is always asking for things shamelessly, mind you she has a full time job and her husband ears well as well.

I'm the kind of person who always avoids confrontation and is long time people pleaser, please tell me what my response towards my elder sil should be when she sees me giving younger sil gift for wedding.

I also my elder sil gift every time, for her, her kids, her husband, but she always wants more.

Also my relatives from my inlwas side, are always asking for things, like i said i dress well, i buy things for myself with my money, and they're always like ""this is nice, get the same for my daughter"" and don't even pay.

I want to get my younger sil good gifts that can help her with wedding preparations, i thought about giving her secretly, but my mil doesn't even dare open any gifts without elder SIL present. I even tell my husband that I need to learn this talent from elder sil on how she has everyone under control. To give you a little idea, she was video calling my husband and he was drinking coffee from this superhero mug i had purchased and his nephew said nice mug, and sil immediately jumped and said bring these mugs for all of us. can you imagine that? it was a simple mug from amazon.

please share any tips you have on how to deal with greedy in laws.",1,1766809164.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

i’m in university and my boyfriend and i met here and have been dating for about four months now!

the thing is that we both live on campus and there isn’t much to do here and getting around is pretty difficult

the thing is that we do love each other but sometimes i feel really neglected by him. he’ll spend all day with his family and i’ll get maybe a text three-four times in a day and it makes me feel really upset. the thing is that when we are together and he gets a text he’ll grab his phone immediately to check but it seems that when we aren’t together he kind of takes forever to respond. there could be many reasons for this but it just stings

additionally i’m really insecure about the girls he’s been with in the past and it just creeps up on me from time to time.

he also never really takes me out or buys me flowers or even for by birthday i never even got a card. i don’t really mind because we are both in college but even a paper card would’ve been nice. i know he knows how to treat other girls because he’s been with a girl romantically before me.

i try to be really understanding but it’s just hard because i know i deserve more. i give him a lot physically, emotionally, etc, and i even put in tremendous amounts of effort into getting to know his family and i go out of my way to attend his family’s events.

not to mention we don’t even know when we started dating and i bring this up a lot but he doesn’t get the hint that maybe he should ask me again, and properly. he took me out for a coffee, sat me down, then asked me. it was nice and i really appreciated the gesture but to me it feels a little forced or maybe just i feel like he could do more.

i just don’t know how to approach this. obviously it’s hard to help because our relationship has a lot of depth that people online wouldn’t see so it’s very complicated but really any advise would be appreciated. :))

1pwoani,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhNE5x7qreU,"Garland Nixon's commentary on his trip to Russia (long story short, he and Scott Ritter did a self-funded trip to Russia). Here are his thoughts.","From Kimi k2

  
-----

  ## **Introduction and Trip Context (00:00–01:44)**

Garland Nixon opens his video by confirming what many of his viewers have been anticipating: he did indeed travel to Russia and Belarus, and he's finally ready to share his comprehensive observations. After a brief personal aside about recently moving from a house to an apartment─which he describes as a ""very interesting"" transition that he finds surprisingly quiet and enjoyable─Nixon dives into the practical details of how this controversial journey materialized. He traveled alongside Scott Ritter, the former US Marine Corps intelligence officer turned prominent geopolitical commentator, and emphasizes the critical importance of financial independence for such a trip. Nixon explains that they deliberately crowdfunded the entire expedition through viewer donations specifically to avoid any appearance of being hosted by Russian entities, which could have triggered allegations of sanctions violations or foreign agent influence. This transparency about funding sources establishes his narrative credibility and preempts potential criticism about compromised journalistic independence. The donations came from his audience, many of whom he acknowledges directly, allowing both men to maintain complete autonomy over their itinerary and reporting. This introduction frames the entire discussion as an independent journalistic endeavor rather than state-sponsored propaganda, a distinction Nixon knows will be crucial for his primarily Western audience that has been conditioned to view any positive reporting from Russia with extreme skepticism.

## **Scott Ritter's Unprecedented Celebrity Status in Russia (01:45–02:24)**

One of Nixon's most striking revelations concerns the towering public profile Scott Ritter enjoys throughout Russia, a phenomenon that began manifesting before they even left American soil. At JFK Airport, while waiting for their flight to Istanbul (their transit point to Russia), Russian travelers began recognizing Ritter and approaching him for photographs and expressions of admiration for his work. This pattern intensified during their layover in Istanbul and reached a crescendo upon arrival in Moscow, where even customs officials in full uniform abandoned their posts momentarily to take photos with Ritter. Nixon uses the Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen analogy to describe his own secondary role─while many Russians recognized him from his collaborative work with Ritter and his interviews for Russian media, he was clearly the supporting player to Ritter's superstar status. This phenomenon reveals the vast appetite within Russia for geopolitical analysis that challenges Western narratives, and how figures like Ritter─who consistently debunks mainstream media claims about the Ukraine conflict─have become genuine folk heroes. Nixon's observation that many of his own videos with Ritter are circulated widely within Russia underscores the sophisticated media consumption habits of Russians, who actively seek out alternative perspectives rather than passively accepting state or Western narratives. This recognition also serves as a powerful counterpoint to Western claims that Russians are brainwashed by state media; instead, it shows they're actively curating content from independent Western voices that validate their own skepticism about NATO and US foreign policy.

## **Moscow's Scale and Economic Advantages (02:25–04:12)**

Nixon's initial impressions of Moscow center on its staggering physical scale and the tangible benefits of Russia's resource wealth. He describes the capital as spanning approximately one thousand square miles, with highway systems featuring seven lanes in each direction─a infrastructural marvel that demonstrates the city's capacity for movement and commerce. But what truly captivates him is how cheap energy fundamentally transforms quality of life. He contrasts Russia with London, where he notes residents ""freeze to death"" because exorbitant energy costs force hotels and homes to keep heat at minimal levels. In Russia, by contrast, hot water and heating are abundant and inexpensive because the government controls energy resources rather than profit-driven multinational corporations. Nixon directly challenges Western narratives about Russian energy shortages, dismissing claims of gas lines or scarcity as pure propaganda. This affordability extends beyond heating to all energy consumption, creating what he describes as ""life ease""─a basic standard of comfort that Westerners increasingly cannot afford under neoliberal economic models. The massive scale of Moscow isn't just impressive statistically; it represents a urban environment where infrastructure serves citizens rather than extracting maximum profit, a theme Nixon returns to repeatedly throughout his analysis.

**Energy Economics and Living Standards**

The implications of cheap energy ripple through every aspect of Russian life in ways Nixon argues Westerners cannot comprehend. He frames this as a fundamental ideological difference: where ExxonMobil, Shell, and Phillips 66 extract and sell resources for maximum profit in the West, Russia's government-owned energy sector provides resources to citizens at ""dirt cheap"" rates. This isn't merely a matter of convenience but a completely different social contract where the state delivers tangible material benefits rather than abstract promises. Nixon emphasizes that Russians can ""turn their heat on"" and ""run all the hot water they want"" without financial anxiety, a stark contrast to the energy poverty spreading across Europe and America. He positions this as evidence that Russia has escaped the neoliberal trap that has made basic utilities unaffordable in the West, suggesting that Western sanctions have backfired by forcing Russia to maximize self-sufficiency and keep resources domestic rather than exporting them for profit.

## **Moscow's Impeccable Cleanliness and Civic Pride (04:13–07:21)**

Nixon expresses profound admiration for Moscow's cleanliness, describing it as ""very, very clean"" with an almost obsessive attention to public order. He recounts witnessing city workers sweeping streets at 12:30 AM, not in response to special events but as routine maintenance. More significantly, he attributes this cleanliness not just to municipal services but to a deep-seated cultural ethos where citizens view their city as an extension of their home. Russians, he observes, don't litter because they possess a ""pride of their city"" analogous to how one wouldn't throw trash on their own living room floor. This civic consciousness stands in direct opposition to Western stereotypes of Russians as drab, depressed, or socially irresponsible. Nixon also highlights Moscow's aesthetic investments, noting how countless buildings are beautifully illuminated at night purely for visual enjoyment rather than commercial purposes. He presents multiple photographs showing ornate architectural lighting that transforms the cityscape into a nighttime gallery, demonstrating what he sees as a commitment to beauty and public experience that transcends mere functionality. These aesthetic choices reflect a societal priority on quality of life that Nixon argues has been sacrificed in profit-driven Western urban development, where lighting serves only advertising or security rather than civic beauty.

## **Stalin-Era Infrastructure: Engineering for Eternity (07:22–10:10)**

The most visually striking examples of Russian infrastructure Nixon encountered were the so-called ""Stalin buildings""─massive, monolithic structures built during the Soviet era that he describes with awe bordering on disbelief. Visiting a Russian channel studio (possibly related to Sputnik or the Ministry of Defense), he examined a building so robustly constructed that he concluded ""a nuclear bomb hitting it straight on wouldn't take it down."" The sheer volume of cement and steel, engineered with no profit motive, created what he calls ""tanks of buildings"" designed to outlast ""heaven and earth."" Nixon draws a sharp contrast with American construction, where profit incentives encourage developers to minimize material costs and maximize margins, resulting in structures with intentionally limited lifespans. Soviet-era builders, working for the state rather than shareholders, could focus purely on durability and purpose without financial constraint. This difference in engineering philosophy becomes a metaphor for broader societal values: the Soviet system prioritized collective longevity over individual profit, creating physical legacy that modern Russia still benefits from. While he humorously notes the paradox of these buildings having plentiful but tiny elevators, his overall assessment is that Moscow's infrastructure represents a lost art of building for permanence rather than planned obsolescence.

## **Affordability and Russia's Non-Neoliberal Economy (10:11–11:51)**

Nixon provides concrete economic data that fundamentally challenges Western narratives about Russian poverty and dysfunction. He recounts a conversation with a Moscow resident paying approximately $500 monthly for a ""decent apartment"" in what he calls Russia's ""premier cosmopolitan top-of-the-line city."" When adjusted for income differences, this equates to roughly $800-900 in US terms─a figure that would be impossible for comparable housing in any major American city. He emphasizes that residents were actively offering to help him find apartments for $300-400 monthly, demonstrating that affordable housing isn't an anomaly but the norm. This affordability extends across the economy because Russia hasn't adopted the neoliberal model of maximum extraction. Nixon stresses that while Russian salaries may be lower in absolute terms, the purchasing power for essentials is much stronger, and citizens don't face the crushing additional costs of student loans, private health insurance, and other mandatory expenses that devour American paychecks. The underlying message is that Russia's economic system, despite its flaws, delivers basic security and comfort in ways that America's supposedly superior market economy no longer does for most citizens.

## **Social Services and Government Responsiveness (11:52–14:10)**

The Russian government's direct accountability to citizens represents perhaps Nixon's most provocative claim. He describes a mobile app system where residents can photograph infrastructure problems like potholes and submit them directly to authorities, with guaranteed response times of about a week. He contrasts this with America, where reporting problems might trigger government suspicion or harassment, joking that citizens could be accused of ""Russian propaganda"" for documenting potholes. Nixon extends this comparison to healthcare and education, noting that all Russian citizens have healthcare coverage and that university is free for students with decent grades─a stark contrast to the American system of crushing medical debt and student loans. He frames this as evidence that the Russian government understands it must ""deliver for the people"" to maintain legitimacy, unlike Western governments that serve military-industrial complexes and foreign interests while neglecting domestic needs. The pothole anecdote becomes symbolic: a government that fixes problems rather than punishing those who report them represents a fundamentally different social contract, one based on reciprocal obligation rather than authoritarian control.

## **Cultural Depth: The Arts as Collective Heritage (14:11–18:55)**

Nixon reveals a dimension of Russian society that he admits surprised him: the deep integration of high culture into everyday life. He discovered that classical music, ballet, opera, and poetry aren't elite pastimes but ""part of their society"" that permeates all classes. In Russian homes, he frequently encountered pianos and guitars, and found that appreciation for Tchaikovsky, Pushkin, and other cultural icons is universal rather than confined to wealthy, ""cultured"" circles as in America. This cultural fluency stems directly from Soviet policies that actively advocated for and built concert halls, theaters, and museums, treating arts as essential social infrastructure rather than luxury commodities. Nixon counted over a hundred simultaneous theatrical performances occurring on any given Friday night in Moscow alone, demonstrating a cultural ecosystem of staggering breadth and accessibility. He draws a sharp contrast with the United States, where cultural literacy has become a class marker and most citizens graduate unable to identify major artistic or literary figures. The Russian system, he argues, produced generations who can discuss their cultural heritage with nuance, understanding both the achievements and moral complexities of historical figures without descending into simplistic cancellation.

## **Historical Consciousness and Educational Philosophy (18:56–20:00)**

The Russian obsession with history, which Nixon initially found perplexing during Tucker Carlson's interview with Putin, became comprehensible through his travels. He realized that being Russian means consciously connecting to an 800-year heritage, understanding how past events shape present realities. This isn't rote nationalism but sophisticated historical thinking that acknowledges complexity. Russians discuss Stalin, for instance, with the same nuance one might discuss a flawed family member─recognizing both achievements and atrocities without demanding pure heroism or pure villainy. Nixon extends this to a universal human principle: everyone has aspects of their personal history they'd prefer remained hidden, and mature societies apply this empathy to historical figures. This perspective allows Russians to maintain pride in their cultural achievements while honestly confronting dark chapters. He observes that this historical consciousness is actively cultivated through education where students study cultural icons ""in depth,"" emerging with genuine knowledge rather than the superficial memorization that characterizes American schooling. The result is a population that can contextualize current events within centuries of geopolitical patterns, making them far more resistant to simplistic propaganda than their Western counterparts.

## **Transportation Infrastructure: The Moscow-St. Petersburg Railway (20:01–26:04)**

Nixon's four-hour journey by high-speed train from Moscow to St. Petersburg provides a detailed case study in Russian infrastructure quality and security protocols. He notes with surprise that boarding the train required airport-level security: passport checks, baggage X-rays, and metal detectors─measures he suggests reflect serious attention to public safety rather than paranoid overreach. The train itself, manufactured by Siemens, astonished him with its modernity: interior design mimicking airplane cabins with plush seating, clean aesthetics, and new fixtures. But the service exceeded mere comfort. Attendants distributed full three-course meals─appetizers, main courses, desserts, coffee─as standard included service, a level of passenger care unimaginable on American Amtrak. As the train traveled at 220-230 kilometers per hour, Nixon observed mile after mile of heavy industry: massive steel mills, refineries, and manufacturing plants accompanied by the towns that house their workers. This landscape evokes nostalgic comparisons to America's former industrial heartland in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania─a ""real economy"" producing physical goods rather than the financialized, service-based economy he sees as hollowed-out in the West. The journey becomes a metaphor for Russia's economic model: fast, efficient, comfortable, and built on industrial substance.

## **St. Petersburg: A Living Museum of Architectural Splendor (30:21–35:53)**

Arriving in St. Petersburg, Nixon acknowledges the city's notoriously harsh weather─cold, rainy, foggy─but argues that its architectural and cultural riches more than compensate. He describes St. Isaac's Cathedral with breathless wonder, calling it ""unfreakingbelievable"" and highlighting its construction from the early 1800s that required 40 years to complete. The technical details captivate him most: massive granite columns, each carved from a single stone, transported hundreds of kilometers and erected using only their own weight─no brackets, no mortar, pure gravitational engineering. These columns survived direct bomb fragments during the Nazi siege without budging, testament to construction philosophies that prioritized permanence over cost. Nixon emphasizes how Russians take pride in maintaining these structures not as museum pieces but as living parts of their heritage. He recounts visiting St. Petersburg University in an old mansion where ""unreal"" wood carvings demonstrated craftsmanship standards that modern production cannot replicate. For Nixon, St. Petersburg represents what he calls ""deep and rich"" culture─a city where every street corner has a story, every building has a historical narrative, and residents possess encyclopedic knowledge of their surroundings. This isn't sterile tourism but passionate civic identity, where people eagerly explain ""this road was here"" and ""that palace was built by Tsar whoever,"" transforming urban geography into an interactive history lesson.

## **Western Propaganda vs. Ground Reality (36:31–40:03)**

The central thesis of Nixon's presentation emerges in his direct confrontation with Western media narratives. Having experienced Russia firsthand, he declares that virtually everything Western audiences believe about Russia is ""the opposite"" of reality. The ""scary place"" depicted in American media─where Putin allegedly lurks on every corner waiting to grab foreigners─bears no resemblance to the safe, vibrant, welcoming society he encountered. Nixon argues that Western governments project their own authoritarian tendencies onto Russia to deflect from domestic repression. When Americans face surveillance, censorship, and punishment for dissenting views on Gaza or Middle East policy, their leaders point to Russia as the real bogeyman. He notes ironically that in America, reporting a pothole might get you investigated for ""Russian propaganda,"" while in Russia it gets the pothole fixed. This propaganda serves a crucial function: maintaining cognitive dissonance. By convincing citizens that Russia is a terrifying dystopia, Western governments justify their own crackdowns on civil liberties as necessary protections against ""foreign influence."" Nixon's evidence─the clean, affordable, culturally rich, and safe environment he experienced─directly contradicts the ""collapsing, tyrannical Russia"" narrative, forcing viewers to question whether they've been systematically misled about geopolitical realities.

## **Law Enforcement and Social Order (40:04–41:09)**

Nixon's observations of Russian police directly challenge Western portrayals of an oppressive security state. During his two weeks in Moscow, he saw remarkably few police officers, and those he observed functioned more as ""referees"" maintaining order than as enforcers of authoritarian control. He describes officers assisting with broken-down cars and managing traffic without the ""beatdown mentality"" he associates with American law enforcement. When he asked Russians about their relationship with police, they didn't even understand the question─indicating such profound normalcy in police-civilian interactions that the concept of systemic antagonism seemed nonsensical. Nixon contrasts this with the American experience where seeing blue lights triggers terror: ""OH CRAP, I'M A DEAD MAN. THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT ME TO DEATH."" He notes that American police in riot gear beat citizens for minor infractions like inadequate social distancing, while Russian police appeared to serve the population rather than dominate it. This characterization, while certainly one-sided, serves his broader argument that Western projections of Russian authoritarianism mask America's own escalating police state. The anecdotal evidence, though limited, paints a picture of law enforcement integrated into society rather than occupying it, a distinction he believes Americans culturally cannot comprehend.

## **American Cognitive Dissonance and Brainwashing (41:10–46:02)**

Nixon dedicates significant time to analyzing the psychological phenomenon he observed when telling Americans about his positive Russian experience. He describes their ""cognitive dissonance""─the mental discomfort when presented with information that contradicts deeply held beliefs. When he tells people Moscow was ""one of my favorite places I've ever been,"" they react with confusion because they've been conditioned to expect tales of terror, surveillance, and deprivation. Nixon reveals that his own daughter reported people asking, ""Oh my god, did he come back alive?"" as if Russia were a war zone rather than a modern capital. He employs a rhetorical strategy of ""feigning ignorance"" when confronted with brainwashed responses, forcing people to articulate their vague fears: ""I don't understand. What do you mean, am I scared of Putin?"" This technique compels them to confront the emptiness behind their programmed reactions─they've been taught to associate ""Putin"" with ""fear"" without any specific understanding of what they actually fear. Nixon traces this conditioning to media practices that associate words with emotional responses rather than factual content, creating a population that reacts hysterically to ""Russia"" while accepting their own government's erosion of civil liberties. The absurdity reaches its peak when he reminds viewers that Americans literally bought duct tape and plastic sheeting in 2003 to protect against nonexistent Iraqi biological weapons, and in 2023 believed Rachel Maddow's claim that Russians could hack America's heating systems during a polar vortex─demonstrating a gullibility that Nixon finds both dangerous and pathetic.

## **Moscow's Vibrant Social and Economic Life (48:49–53:44)**

Contrasting sharply with Western images of gray, depressed Soviet existence, Nixon describes Moscow as a metropolis teeming with wealth and nightlife. He recounts a karaoke venue where patrons perform not with canned backing tracks but with a full live band and backup singers, complete with stage lighting that makes participants ""the lead singer"" for a night. This anecdote illustrates the city's dedication to quality-of-life experiences. He observes ""Bentleys, Rolls-Royces, Bugattis"" outside high-end restaurants, confirming that Moscow hosts extreme wealth alongside its affordable middle-class lifestyle. Nixon doesn't shy from the less savory aspects, noting the presence of ""silicone girls""─women with obvious cosmetic enhancements─as evidence that Moscow is a ""metropolitan city with a lot of money"" experiencing the same aesthetic pressures as Los Angeles or Miami. But he frames this as normalization: Russia has high-end cars, plastic surgery, and luxury goods because it's a successful modern economy, not the bleak command-economy wasteland depicted in Western media. The streets are filled with ""beautiful people"" whose ""hair is cutting nice"" and clothes are fashionable, partying on weekends despite cold weather that would keep Americans indoors. Russians, he notes, barely wear gloves in temperatures that have him bundled like ""the fur man from Siberia,"" revealing a cultural hardiness and social vitality that defies stereotypes of a population beaten down by authoritarianism and poverty.

## **Belarus: The ""Uber Ultra Clean"" Alternative (54:21–56:38)**

Nixon transitions to Belarus with even higher praise, describing Minsk as so clean that ""you could probably go around with an electron microscope and you couldn't find bacteria."" While Moscow impressed him with its orderliness, Minsk operates at another level entirely─""filthy beside Belarus"" is how he describes Moscow's relative cleanliness. He shows multiple video clips of street sweepers constantly working and emphasizes that residents maintain this standard through the same civic pride observed in Russia. The spotless streets, manicured grass, and absence of litter reflect what Nixon sees as a deliberate cultural choice to prioritize public space. He connects this to Belarus's socialist heritage, where collective ownership fostered collective responsibility. The visual evidence he presents─streets where ""you don't see trash,"" ""you don't see accumulated anything""─serves as tangible proof that alternative economic models can produce superior civic outcomes. For Nixon, Minsk's cleanliness isn't merely aesthetic; it represents a society that values its shared environment more than individual convenience, a value system he believes has been destroyed in the West by consumerism and hyper-individualism.

## **Belarusian Health Culture and COVID Response (56:39–60:35)**

One of Nixon's most startling claims involves Belarus's handling of COVID-19, which he uses to indict Western public health policies. He recalls that while the world locked down in 2020, Belarusian President Lukashenko refused, declaring the virus ""natural"" and declining to impose mask mandates or business closures. Western media predicted catastrophe, warning that Belarusians were ""dead men and women"" after allowing millions to attend their annual World War II parade. Yet the outcome defied predictions: among 9.5 million people, only 700 COVID deaths occurred─""the lowest in all of Europe."" Nixon attributes this success not to luck but to lifestyle factors systematically ignored in the West. Belarus, like Russia, prohibits GMO foods and most chemical preservatives and insecticides, resulting in ""real food"" that boosts immune systems. More importantly, he observes that Belarusians ""walk everywhere"" as a cultural norm, making 20-45 minute walks standard for daily errands. This constant exercise, combined with healthy diets, produced a population with minimal obesity and robust physical condition. While locked-down Westerners grew sedentary and immunocompromised, Belarusians continued outdoor activity, absorbing vitamin D and maintaining fitness. Nixon presents this as damning evidence that Western COVID policies served corporate and control agendas rather than public health, while Belarus's ""do nothing"" approach achieved superior outcomes through pre-existing healthy social infrastructure.

## **Knowledge as National Priority: The Minsk Library (61:11–62:58)**

Nixon uses a single building to encapsulate Belarus's national philosophy: a massive, architecturally stunning complex he initially mistook for a corporate headquarters or World Trade Center equivalent. The structure's glass façade, extensive grounds, and central location suggested it housed financial or governmental elites. In fact, he discovered it was Minsk's central library. This revelation becomes a rhetorical hammer to attack Western values: ""Imagine a country that puts so much money into knowledge."" While America builds extravagant corporate headquarters and military installations, Belarus invests comparable resources into public learning. Nixon shares an old joke─""If you want to make sure an American doesn't steal your money, hide it in a book""─to emphasize how anti-intellectualism has become cultural in the US. The library symbolizes a society that doesn't just respect knowledge but centers it physically and economically. He contrasts this with American libraries underfunded, understaffed, and increasingly irrelevant, arguing that Belarus's priorities reveal a long-term thinking absent in the quarterly-profit mentality of Western capitalism. For Nixon, the building proves that small nations can achieve greatness not through military power but by cultivating human capital, a strategy he believes threatens Western hegemony because it demonstrates viable alternatives to neoliberal development models.

## **Belarusian Economic Wisdom and National Identity (63:56–65:24)**

Nixon presents Belarus as a model of economic sophistication despite its small size (9-10 million people). Residents explained to him that Belarus builds everything from massive mining equipment to computer chips, maintaining a diversified economy because ""if one area of the economy goes down... our poor little country would crap out."" This conscious economic diversification─with robust dairy, technology, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors─demonstrates strategic thinking Nixon finds absent in Western economies over-reliant on finance and services. He emphasizes Belarusian pride in their distinct identity; while they ""love the Russians"" and maintain close ties, they assert ""we're not the same as Russians"" and celebrate their unique culture. This nuanced nationalism impresses Nixon as mature and confident rather than chauvinistic. He recounts a friend's warning that a single man visiting Belarus with a girlfriend might face relationship trouble because Belarusian women are not only beautiful but highly educated and physically fit from constant walking─combining aesthetic appeal with intellectual substance. This lighthearted anecdote underscores his broader point: Belarus has built a society that values holistic human development over narrow economic metrics, creating a population that is healthy, educated, and culturally grounded in ways that challenge Western assumptions about post-Soviet states.

## **Geopolitical Realities and Final Observations (65:25–66:10)**

Nixon concludes by framing Belarus's pro-Russia orientation as a rational response to European aggression. Belarusians explicitly tell him: ""We're a small country and these Europeans are freaking lunatics and if they could they'd overthrow us and steal everything we got."" This assessment, he argues, demonstrates clear-eyed geopolitical realism. Aligning with powerful Russia provides security against NATO expansionism and Western regime-change operations. He notes that Belarusians understand their history of being attacked by Europeans, making their strategic partnership with Russia not ideological but existential. Nixon's final message reinforces his central thesis: both Russia and Belarus deliver for their citizens─affordable living, cultural richness, public safety, and responsive governance─while Western governments serve foreign interests and domestic oligarchs. He promises a future video covering additional experiences but leaves viewers with the provocative challenge to ""share this on all your social media platforms,"" explicitly encouraging the spread of information that contradicts mainstream narratives. His parting shot is a call to action that recognizes the video's subversive potential against Western propaganda he spent over an hour dissecting, framing the simple act of sharing as the ""most important thing"" viewers can do to combat the brainwashing he so meticulously documented.

I think it might have been the cold weather or something, but our waiter at the cafe today was not at all accommodating or kind, he was kind of a douche tbh. 

I took my mom and sister out for coffee and cake, and when ordering, he kept rolling his eyes at stuff we ordered and then telling us they were out (without us knowing they were out of anything). He told my sister they were out of brownies, but I clearly saw plenty of brownies on their display when I walked in, so I asked him to check again, and he came back saying “ah yeah, I forgot about those” in a very snarky tone. Also when my mom asked for a warm water with lemon he said the lemon was extra, but in a very condescending tone  that kinda sounded like maybe he didn’t think my mom could afford to pay for extra lemon? that made me a bit mad because no one talks to my mom like that, right?

Anyway, after we were done I get up to pay the bill at the register, he proceeds to finish the transaction, and then points out to an iPad screen with a “rate our waiter” survey, which gave me the chance to qualify his service using a range of emojis that went from a super happy face or “great service!” To a frowny face that read “terrible service”.

We both cut and faceted gemstones and because of this we share a very expensive machine. We have made a  bit of a work station for this machine which includes bright lamps. This wouldn't be a problem but we live in a studio so the bright lamps are hard to avoid with your eyes when trying to do anything else. I had been shopping around for pegboard board backing to put on the desk to help with this problem and a lot of it was pretty expensive so I figured I would wait till after Christmas to get it. I had many discussions with my boyfriend about this and that we can buy after the holidays. So my boyfriend decided that must be the gift I need. A pegback board for our station. Now normally I am happy with any gift and its not the gift that matters but what makes me mad is everything he got me is for us to use, besides a few stones for me to cut, which he also bought himself the same ones besides one. Now I tried hard to get meaningful gift for him, stuff I know he really wanted and needed. I even got him a new espresso machine because he didn't like the ( much nicer one) I got to replace the older cheap one. So I bought him the older style he preferred again even though I hate it. He got me ice cube trays and lids for reusable coffee mugs( not the right size for the mug I use) everything he got me was for his use too or mainly. Now I feel like an ass for getting frustrated today while cleaning and snapped at him. ( he set up the pegboard last night eventhough I asked him not to as I wanted to think about all the cords and layout and everything before setting it up). He also bought a lamp for the set up that won't work at all for the set up but that was also a gift. I explained after I snapped that i was a bit upset about it and he's logic was that was what I wanted and I am ungrateful. 

I get it should be happy with anything but he's the only one I get anything from and its just his usual MO. Last year he got me a bunch of silversmithing stuff that I didn't want and have not touched. ( I wanted to learn 3d printing not soldering but he wanted to learn soldering.)

Now, while I have no experience in gator territory, I totally get that they are basically a non concern for the responsible canoeist. I'm also aware that in the winter they make themselves relatively scarce. HOWEVER I have also just come across [this](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Mc19nFiyG/) absolutely bonkers video of a gator congregation during low waters a couple of summers ago. Now I'm not expecting to encounter anything exactly like this (I don't think?), but it did make me pause a bit and wonder - is there anything in particular I should know/be prepared for gator-wise in these conditions?

Thanks in advance for answering my silly questions.",1,1766808134.0,OkefenokeeSwamp,0,1.0,False

1pwo3mz,https://i.redd.it/oaubx4147o9g1.jpeg,Reviews for Beginners by a Beginner #9 - Seelbach’s Private Reserve 15,"What is “Buff Turkey?” Let’s start with a little history, about 15-16 years ago Wild Turkey was acquired by Campari Group and amidst the expansion there were some concerns that production goals could be met. So, WT tapped Buffalo Trace to lend a hand, using the traditional 75/13/12 Turkey mash bill BT distilled the bourbon which was then aged at WT. Now the prevailing story is that WT felt the final product strayed too far from their signature profile that they chose to sell off the barrels to various non-distiller producers (NDP’s). Seelbach’s is apparently one of those NDP’s, and I luckily was able to get my hands on a bottle…

**Mash bill:** 75% corn / 13% rye / 12% malted barley

**Proof:** 117

**Age:** 16+ years

**Nose:** Proofy at first, oak and citrus. This is overcome by intense waves of honey, sweet and thick. There’s some berry notes, maple and light vanilla, but the honey really carries this nose. Some milk chocolate comes through as you work through the glass rounding out the experience.

**Palette:** The sweetness carries through, the honey and vanilla are there but the berries shine through at the tip of the tongue. As it coats your mouth and hits the mid palette the oak really comes through strong and takes over. You really get an appreciation for the age here, it’s not over oaky because the sweetness still lingers.

**Finish:** The finish is hot, definitely drinks hotter than it’s proof but it works very well here. The oak turns into something more, leather, coffee and the smoky tobacco of a nice cigar. The burn lasts long, warms up your chest. As this subsides a final wave of honey fills your mouth and leaves you wanting that next sip.

Buy a pour? **Yes**

Buy again? **Yes**

T8ke Score: **9/10**

**Thoughts:** This is truly a sensational pour. Everything about it is big and bold. Now, are the stories true? Who knows. If yes, the $299 price tag doesn’t seem so insane. Imagine what these would be going for if Buffalo Trace released the bottles.

1pwo2az,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pwo2az/my_sister_said_her_boyfriend_was_acting_weird_im/,My sister said her boyfriend was acting weird. I’m starting to believe her.,"I’m writing this because I’m scared. No, I’m terrified. I’m sitting here in my car, cold, breath trembling. I’ve been in this same spot since last night. I don’t know what to do, but I hope this finds you and you find me, before it does.

Let me start by prefacing this with a little bit of background. I want y’all to know that we’re not crazy. We’re young, a little wild, but not crazy. My name is George and I have a twin sister named Gina. Gina is dating my bestfriend since high school, Preston. Obviously, I’ve known my sister my whole life and we met Preston at 14. We’re 24 now. We have a close bond, so close that we all live together. Preston and Gina are both data engineers and I’m a private chef. We live pretty normal lives. However, we do occasionally love a little thrill seeking; rock climbing, bungee jumping, skating in empty pools on private property, exploring and tagging abandoned buildings —- you know, things like that. It’s a relief from having to be professional all of time. I won’t lie though, I’m starting to regret ever having enjoyed those things.

But, that’s enough background. I ought to make this quick. Here’s what’s been happening. A month ago, things were normal. It was like any other day. Preston and Gina woke up early and ate breakfast at the kitchen table. The smell of eggs, bacon, and maple filled the house. It drew me to the kitchen like the sounds of a siren draws a sailor to his demise. I should’ve stayed upstairs, but I mosied on down there. I could hear them laughing softly at whatever TikTok video my sister was showing Preston. “Good morning brother.”, Gina’s voice echoed as I bent the corner. “Morning y’all”, my voice cracking as I forced a sound from my parched lips. “Food’s in the microwave bro.” Preston, responding to the sound of my stomach growling. Everything was normal. Everything was as it should be.

“So, are you taking the job George?” I looked at my sister as she peered at me from over the top of her coffee mug.

“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I told them yes.”

“I think it’s a good idea.” Preston added. I was offered a job in New York the week before. A private chef experience for a couple bougie millionaires. I’d never been to New York, but I’ve always wanted to go. The job was three weeks long, or so it should’ve been. It was some kind of rich person’s retreat, dressed up as “fiscal planning”.

(Gina) “Well, before you go. Let’s all do something together. When do you leave again?”

I should’ve said no.

“If I go, Monday.”

(Preston) “That’s two days from now? Damn, I didn’t realize it was that soon. We -“

(Gina) “We should go tag that abandoned warehouse we saw the other day!!!!”

“Abandoned warehouse? Where?”

(Preston) “Yeah, a few blocks over.”

“No, there’s not. I mean I think I would’ve noticed an abandoned warehouse that close to home.”

(Gina) “I mean, we just moved here a month ago and we never really explored the area. Feasible that you would’ve missed it.”

(Preston) “Plus, it’s pretty tucked away. It’s like off a side street, almost cul de sac style. We only saw it because Gina here made a wrong turn yesterday.”

(Gina) “Whatever, so you down or what bro?”

“Yeah, whatever sure. Let’s go tomorrow so I can use Sunday to pack.”

I should’ve said no.

My sister let out an excited squeal.

The next day it was business as usual. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be. Me, Gina, and Preston pilled into my Toyata 4Runner. The air was familiar, a smell I had grown accustomed to from book bags filled to the brim with spray paint mixed with smell of the twine that built the rope we used for climbing. I couldn’t tell where one smell began and the other ended. There was an excited energy in the car as Gina pointed out the directions. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field.

Preston was right. This was a cul de sac, with a huge empty warehouse at the end. Decrepit. Over-grown. The trees draped over the building like bags on the eyes of a man who’s lived way past his prime. Graffiti lined the building, reminding me of the faded tattoos on my skin. I know this may not make any sense, but the building —- the building almost seemed alive. Sad. Forgetting.

I parked. We got out the car, book bags, smiles on Preston and Gina.

“Y’all sure about this?”

(Preston) “Never known you to be scared bro.”

“I’m not”….

I was lying. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to go in. Maybe it was intuition. Maybe I watched too many scary movies. I don’t know, but I found myself standing there alone. Preston and Gina, already in the building, beckoning me forward.

Each step was heavy, boulders tied to my feet. I took a deep breath and thought to myself. “Man up, you’ve walked into a hundred abandoned buildings. This one’s no different. This isn’t a movie, it’s real life.”

Words I regret now.

I walked in. The air outside was cold, but the air in here was warm. I could feel the house breathing, the warm air moved at a cadence, in and out, in and out, in and out. Before I knew it my breathes matched it.

Hold on y’all, I think I need to move my car. I see people in the field. I’ll be back to finish in a moment, but I’ll post this for now. Just in case.

———————————————————————————

It was them. My bestfriend and my sister, walking across that field, towards me, expressions empty. I think I pressed the pedal through the floor as I drove out of there. In the rear view mirror, I saw them turn around and stare at my fleeing car. No smile, no frown, just a blank stare standing there, watching from where it used to be.

I know I said, I’d be back in a moment and it’s been hours. But bare with me, I couldn’t stop, I couldn’t get the image of their faces out of my head. I drove to escape my mind. It’s playing tricks on me. I needed time to collect my thoughts.

Anyways, I’ll start back from where I was. I promise it will all make sense at the end.

When I walked in that building, it felt like I walked into the mouth of a beast. It was hot, humid, alive. The normal sounds of an abandoned building escaped whatever place this was, no birds, no rats scruffling across the floor, no creaks as we walked through. Complete silence.

(Gina) “Let’s go up there.” She pointed to an empty spot on the wall with a staircase leading up to it or what was left one.

“Sure.” I think my voice cracked a little.

(Preston) “You head up first since the ropes are in your bag, you can tied one up and toss it down for us.”

I should’ve turned around.

I crept up the stairs, still not a sound. It didn’t creak under the pressure of my steps, I couldn’t even hear the tap of my foot as I climbed. Utter silence.

(Gina) “Hurry up George, you’re moving like a grandpa.”

“Shut up Gina.”, but she was right. Everything in my body was telling me to stop. Walk back down. Go home. Instead, I tied the rope around a rail that was bolted to the wall and flung it down.

“Here, but I don’t think you’ll need it. The steps didn’t give at all when I came up.”

(Preston) “You’re right. Easy work.”

(Gina) “Well keep going. I want to tag that spot.”

(Preston) “Yeah, we’re going Gina relax.”

We had to walk across a tattered floor, missing half its boards to get there but we did. Preston and Gina dropped their books bags and unpacked the cans.

(Preston) “Look alive George” He threw a couple cans my way and I tripped over a board in attempt the catch them. Fell flat on my face. I could hear the sounds of my sister’s obnoxious laugh and Preston walked over to help me up

(Preston) “Damn, you good man?”

“Yeah, I just lost my balance. Shit, it’s a lot going on with these floor boards.”

(Preston) “Yeah, let’s get this over with”

Preston walked back to spot on the wall. I took a deep breath, shook my can, and sprayed away. In that moment, every worry drifted. As I crossed my lines and made my imagination come to life, I lost track of time. I forgot where we were, the fear that enveloped me as I walked through this building. I walked through what used to be a door way, continued to tag. I was in another world….. until I wasn’t.

Crash My heart dropped as I heard the sounds of boards breaking, my sister screaming. I turned, Preston had fell through the floor.

(Preston) “Fuck! Help me out of here. I can’t see shit down here.” For some reason, I was froze. My feet wouldn’t budge no matter how hard I tried.

(Gina) “George, what the fuck!” Gina ran over and yanked the other rope out of my book bag and tossed it in. I followed here, wrapped my arms around her and pulled the rope”

(Gina) “Preston! Preston!”

No answer.

(Gina) “Preston grab the FUCKING rope”

It was a second, a second too long before we felt a tug on the rope.

I should’ve known then, we should’ve never came here.

I walked backwards, my sister following my steps, lifting Preston out of the hole. He fell over to the side, covered in filth, clearly annoyed.

“Preston, how you feel man?”

(Preston) “I’m fine, let’s just get the fuck out of here.”

(Gina) “Yeah, let’s go”

We packed the supplies, untied the rope on the stairs and headed out the building. I didn’t say anything, but I was relieved. It was dark now, and I just wanted to get home.

The car ride was —- dead. Preston nor Gina said a word. As soon as we walked in Preston went upstairs and Gina didn’t hesitate when he was out of sight.

(Gina) “What the fuck was that earlier George?”

“What are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Why did it take you so long to help?”

“I don’t know”

(Gina) “I don’t know? You answer is I don’t fucking know?! Unbelievable.”

She scoffed and left me standing there. I don’t know why, but in that moment, part of me didn’t want to pull that rope up.

We didn’t see each other for the rest of that night and we barely spoke until I left. Just a few “what’s up”’s in passing. I figured Gina told Preston that I froze and he was pissed at me.  When Monday came, I slipped out the house early and sent them text. “Just left. See y’all in a few weeks”

Honestly. A week and a half had passed since the incident and I hadn’t spoke to Preston or my sister. Being a private chef for the rich was exhausting work. I barely had time to talk or text and when I had free time, I slept. But one day, my sister called me.

(Gina) “George.”, her voice broke a little as she said my name

“Wassup.”

(Gina) “Preston has been acting weird lately.”

“What do you mean?”

(Gina) “3 days ago. I came down stairs and he was just watching static on the tv. I called his name a couple times. He didn’t even budge. It freaked me out a bit so I went upstairs. I figured I’d ask him when he came up for bed but he never did.”

“Well, did you talk to him about it?”

(Gina) “I tried, but he blew me off. He said he woke up on the couch after falling asleep watching tv and maybe it had just went out or something.”

“Maybe it did.”

(Gina) “No, he was sitting up right. He wasn’t sleep, he was staring at the screen. Silent.”

“I don’t know what you want me to say Gina. Maybe he was just screwing with you.”

(Gina) “He’s been doing it for 3 days straight!”

“Maybe he’s committed to the bit”

(Gina) she was clearly annoyed, “Whatever George, can you just talk to him?”

“Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But I’m sure you’re overreacting.”

She was not overreacting. I know that now.

I called Preston that day and he didn’t answer. I shot him a text asking if he was okay. He said everything was fine and I left it there. I told myself, I’d call him later but as I said, the job was exhausting. It slipped my mind completely. I never reached back out.

3 days passed.

My sister called me again. Sobbing.

(Gina) “George, please come home. Something is wrong with him.”

“What Gina, what are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Something is wrong with Preston. Please, come home. I’m scared.”

“I can’t just leave because you and Preston are in a fight.”

(Gina) “We’re not in a fight. He - He’s different. Every night. Him and that damn tv. It’s every single night. I find him staring at me constantly. This morning when I woke he was just standing over our bed. He was staring at me, no expression at all. Just staring. I don’t feel safe.”

“Then just got back to mom and dad’s for a while. I can’t come back.” She wasn’t listening.

(Gina) “George. There’s something wrong. When I look into his eyes, I don’t. George, he keeps going ba——”

I was being called by my party as she was talking.

“Gina, I have to go. My clients are calling.”

I hung up abruptly and finished my day out. By the time I woke up, my sister had called me 42. Up until then, I thought she was just being dramatic but as I scrolled through my missed calls —- my heart sank more and more. I mean I was sure it was nothing, but I felt obligated to at least check it out. Against my will, I cut my job short and brought the next ticket back to Minnesota. I called my sister from the airport.

“Gina.”

(Gina) “Are you coming home?”

“Yeah. My flight lands in 2.5 hours. ”

(Gina) “I’ll meet you there.”

I pondered about my sister’s calls the whole flight home. I mean, Preston’s behavior was strange but he wasn’t causing any harm. Maybe I just didn’t understand because I wasn’t witnessing it. I kept trying to remember what she was saying when I hung up. He keeps going where?

My flight landed and my sister quickly found me. She stood at the baggage claim.

“You were just waiting here?”

(Gina) “I told you, I’d meet you here.”

“Where’s your car?”

(Gina) “I ubered here. You parked here right?”

“Yeah.”

We walked to my car. Silence filled the atmosphere so thick you could cut it.

(Gina) “He’s been going back there every night.”

“Going where?”

(Gina) “That warehouse.”

“Why?”

(Gina) “I don’t know.”

“Where’s he now?”

(Gina) “I don’t know. I went to mom and dad’s last night and I hadn’t been back. I wasn’t going back until you came home.”

“Okay.”

I didn’t have to tell my sister where I was going. She knew. We pulled up in the driveway and I felt a lump form in my throat. I walked in and Preston was standing in the kitchen. He didn’t even look up when we came in. He just stood there, staring at the counter until his gaze slowly moved up to meet mine. I felt violated, like he could see through my clothes. I felt naked in front of him. His eyes. His eyes were lifeless. He seemed a man with no soul, eyes sunken, hair disheveled. It seems like forever passed without him saying a word.

“Preston. You look like shit.”

He didn’t say a single word back to me, not even a grunt.

He stepped from around the kitchen corner and every bone in my body shook as he walked past me. He didn’t even acknowledge us. He just walked out the front door, got in his car, and drove off.

For the love of God, I don’t know why I went after  him. We should’ve just let him leave. But I saw the tears in my sister’s eyes. She pleaded with me without ever moving her lips.

“Come on. We’ll follow him.”

(Gina) “We don’t have to. He’s going to that warehouse.”

The sounds of that place made my heart skip a beat. I immediately recalled our conversation last night and knew that’s what she was trying to tell me. This isn’t how I planned to spend my first day back, chasing a guy who clearly doesn’t want to be caught.

I should’ve told her to just let it go, but instead I sighed, turned around, walked out the door. I could hear her foot steps behind me.

Another silent car ride, but my thoughts screamed at me. “Turn around. Do not go back to the warehouse. Do not step foot back in the building.” With every caution my brain threw at me, I threw a reason back, “That’s my bestfriend. My sister loves him. It’s just a warehouse.” But all of that reason left as I pulled back up to that place, as I walked up to the front door, my sister clinging to my back. He breathed was shaky, I could tell she was scared.

We shouldn’t have went in there. We shouldn’t have went after him.

It was different this time when we entered. The silence this place once offered has dissipated. I heard steps coming from upstairs. The air moving through the building gave a soft groan, the type you hear from an animal that hadn’t fed in days but just laid eyes on its next meal.

(Gina) “Is that rope?” She pointed towards the spot we tagged when we first came here. She was right, there was a rope leading directly into the hole Preston fell in before.

We should’ve turned around there.

I walked forward without ever responding; up the same stairs from before that creaked, over the same broken floor boards, careful as I knew my sister was following me. I stopped once I got back to that whole

I don’t know why, but I whispered “Preston. Yo Preston, you down there.”

A chill went up my spine as I heard his voice, familiar but not quite right.

(Preston) “Down here.” I saw a slight tug on the rope.

I shouldn’t have went down there.

“Stay here and turn the flash light on your phone, on”

(Gina) “You’re going down there?”

“Looks like I have to.”

I’m almost certain you could see my heart pounding out of my chest. What was I even thinking? I grabbed the rope that was draped into the hole and dropped myself down. My sister holding the flash light over my head but it did nothing to pierce the dark abyss I entered. It felt like forever as I climbed my way down the rope, each drop down against the rope, my grip loosening up, palms sweat, heart racing.

Thud My feet hit the ground. It was pitch black. I fumbled around in my pocket for my phone. I didn’t want to turn my flash light on, but I couldn’t see a thing.

I should’ve climbed back out. Matter of fact, i should’ve never came down here.

Before I could get my phone out of my pocket. Thud I stifled my scream but jumped, fell straight on my ass.

(Gina) “It’s me”

“I told you to stay up there. Why did you come down here?! I thought you were holding the light.” I yelled at her softly.

(Gina) “I couldn’t let you come alone and I put the phone in my mouth while I climbed down.”

The light, I had never turned my flash light on.

My sister had her flash pointed at me as I finally got the phone out my pocket, hit the flash light switch.

I should’ve left it off. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see.

I saw him. I saw Preston, except, this wasn’t Preston at all. He stood there, staring at us. He said nothing. He just tilted his head and for a split second he smirked before he took one step forward and his eyes flashed a pitch black before turning back to normal.

Gina screamed, Preston or whatever that was ran. I scurried backward, quickly until I ran into something. My back hit, only what I could describe as a pod. It was huge, round, and filled with what seemed like amniotic fluid. I whipped my head around and the flight light followed.

I couldn’t wrap my mind around what I saw. It was Preston, inside of this thing. I couldn’t hold in my holler and I ran back to my sister. She was on the floor, sobbing.

“Get up. I found Preston.”

(Gina) shaking her head. “That wasn’t Preston. That thing wasn’t Preston.”

“No, the real -“ I didn’t finish my sentence, I just dragged her over to the wall and flashed my light. I didn’t know her eyes could get that wide. She immediately began clawing at whatever it was, trying to break him free.

(Gina) “Preston. Preston. Preston.”

“Gina, He gon—-“ . I ate my words before I could even finish them, he started to move as she started to break the sack. I couldn’t believe it. How was that even possible? Before I knew it, I was clawing at it too. The slime running down my hand and arms. My clothes covered in goo.

(Preston) “huhhhhh” Preston dropped out, coughing relentlessly, hands and knees on the floor. Before I could even say anything to him, I heard my sister scream again.

“GINA!” Was all I could get out before I hit the floor, my phone knocked out of my hand. My side was pierced, something was stabbing me and somebody or something was on top of me.

(Preston) “Fuck!” Another thud, whatever was on top of me was gone and I could see a light running towards it. Preston was fighting Preston.

(Preston) “Help George!”

Preston yelled at me, the familiar voice of my friend and I felt around for anything. Anything at all. In the dark, I feel a piece of wood that broke off the floor board from above. I grabbed it, grabbed my side.

“Hold him.” I said as I charged forward. The only thing guiding me is the shaky light from my sister’s phone. I plunged it right into it, the other Preston before I fell. Preston took over, stabbing it until it couldn’t move. I felt his arms wrap around me and he dragged me, directing Gina to the rope.

How did he know this place so well? How was did he get his strength back so quickly? This doesn’t make any sense but in that moment I was grateful for all the things I didn’t understand.

I didn’t dare to think it. Although, deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

(Preston) “Grab the rope George”

I did as he told, every surge of adrenaline running through my body as blood poured out of my side. I could see my sister’s flash shuffling up the rope. Pain surged as Preston tied the rope around our bodies, he gripped me with his legs, and climbed up —- Gina, at the top, pulling us both up. I had never seen her with that much strength.

We made it out that hole but before we left I looked down and saw the flash of my phone still shining upward. In the faint glow, I saw them. More pods. More bodies. Eyes fixated as Preston lifted me over his back, carrying me out the building.

“Guys”. I passed out before I could tell them what I saw.

I woke up with stitches, Preston and Gina by my bedside.

“What happened?”

(Preston) “You got stabbed with a wooden plank. You lost a lot of blood.”

“No. What the fuck happened to you down there?”

(Preston) “I don’t know, but I saw everything it did. I have every memory of its time as me.”

I knew Preston well. I knew he was lying.

“What was that thing?”

(Preston) “I don’t know.”

Something in his voice seemed off. It was steady, even paced, as if he rehearsed those lines. I brushed it off but he seemed, too calm after witnessing —— no living through what he just lived through. I would’ve pressed this issue, but…. I just wanted to forget the whole nightmare.

I should’ve left the house after that. Went to stay with my parents. I didn’t though.

Two weeks have passed after I left the hospital. I swear y’all, things were back to normal. We had decided that we weren’t going to mention that place again or what happened. We were never going to go back to that building. We promised each other we were going to move on with our lives. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be.

Until it wasn’t. Yesterday, I went down stairs to get a glass of water in the middle of the night. I saw Preston and Gina were up, watching static on the tv. I felt my throat closed as I grabbed my keys and walked out the front door. I didn’t even bother getting dressed or putting on real shoes. I drove straight to that building. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field. My mind was in a frenzy…. Who or what have I been living with. So many more questions I dared not to ask myself.

I stayed there all night. That’s where I began to write this story, moving only when I saw them coming from across the field earlier. Whoever I saw though, that wasn’t Preston or Gina. The eyes, the eyes were black. If I can be truthful with you all, I don’t know which is worse. The fact that I had been living with them, business as usual for weeks. Or the fact that I don’t know where my bestfriend or my sister are because when I went back last night, the building was gone. It was just an empty field. I think it was the combination of both that prompted me to drive for hours. And for some odd reason, after it all, I came back home. A sailor returning to his boat. I’ve been here for hours now, trying to find the words to finish this story. Wrapping my mind around what’s happened, what’s happening. I haven’t moved from my room, but I heard them come inside a while ago.

I’m not scared anymore. Writing this has relieved my fear. I’ve accepted my fate or maybe I’m too tired to fight. Either way…..

Everything was almost normal, except, it’s wasn’t. It’s night time and….

Downstairs I smell eggs, bacon, and maple. The smell is drawing me to the kitchen, the siren’s call to my sailor. I don’t want to, but I feel the need to go downstairs. I can hear them laughing.",2,1766807820.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Seriously. It's either ""make eye contact!"" (thanks captain obvious) or some PUA bullshit that makes everyone uncomfortable. 

I spent way too much time reading evolutionary psychology papers, rewatching body language breakdowns, listening to behavioral experts on podcasts like *Hidden Brain* and *The Science of Success*, because honestly? I kept missing signals and it was driving me insane. Turns out our brains are wired to pick up on attraction cues, but modern life and anxiety tend to scramble that radar pretty badly.

Here's what actually matters. Real attraction isn't about the obvious stuff, it's about the micro behaviors most people aren't even aware they're doing. These signs are backed by actual research in nonverbal communication and human behavior, not just recycled reddit wisdom.

## the stuff that actually indicates attraction

**their feet point toward you even when their body doesn't.** Sounds weird but feet are the most honest part of body language. While someone can control their face and torso, feet naturally orient toward what (or who) holds their attention and interest. Research from body language experts shows this is one of the most reliable indicators because it's subconscious. Next time you're talking to someone, glance down briefly. If their feet are angled your way even in a group setting, that's significant.

**they mirror your movements with a slight delay.** This one's fascinating. When someone's attracted, they unconsciously mimic your gestures, posture, speech patterns within a few seconds. Pick up your drink, they pick up theirs. Cross your legs, they adjust their position similarly. It's called the chameleon effect and it's your brain's way of building rapport with someone you're drawn to. *The Definitive Book of Body Language* by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down brilliantly (these authors have studied nonverbal communication for decades and this book is legitimately the gold standard, makes you hyper aware of what people are actually communicating). Try subtly changing your posture and see if they follow.

**their voice changes when talking to you.** People alter their vocal tone around someone they're attracted to, usually without realizing it. Women's voices often get slightly higher and more melodic (signals youth and femininity from an evolutionary standpoint). Men's voices typically deepen (signals strength and masculinity). But here's the kicker, both might also speak more softly, creating this intimate auditory bubble that excludes others. Pay attention to how someone sounds with you versus how they sound talking to other people.

**they find excuses for incidental touch.** Not creepy touching, but brief, seemingly accidental contact. Brushing your arm when making a point. Touching your shoulder while laughing. Adjusting your collar or picking lint off your shirt. These micro touches are testing boundaries and creating physical connection. Attraction makes people want to close physical distance in small, socially acceptable ways.

**their pupils dilate when looking at you.** This is pure biology and completely involuntary. When we see something we find attractive or interesting, our pupils expand to take in more visual information. Obviously you can't stare into someone's eyes measuring pupil size like a creep, but in good lighting during conversation, you might notice their eyes look darker or more open. It's why dim lighting is considered romantic, makes everyone's pupils dilate creating the illusion of mutual attraction.

**they remember obscure details you mentioned once.** Attraction heightens attention and memory. If someone brings up that random thing you said three weeks ago about your childhood pet or your coffee order or that band you like, their brain flagged you as significant. We don't retain details about people we're indifferent toward. *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally studied influence and attraction professionally, insanely good read for understanding interpersonal dynamics) explains how our brains prioritize information about people we're attracted to or invested in.

BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts that turns top books, research papers, and expert talks into custom audio podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in anything you want to learn, like improving social intelligence or understanding attraction psychology, and it pulls from high-quality sources to create episodes just for you. You control the length from a 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and pick voices ranging from calm and soothing to energetic or even sarcastic depending on your mood. 

The app also builds an adaptive learning plan that evolves with you, and there's a virtual coach avatar called Freedia you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. It's perfect for busy people who want to keep growing without endless scrolling. The content covers all the books mentioned here and way more, fact-checked and science-based.

**they get slightly nervous or clumsy around you.** Attraction triggers a stress response, releasing cortisol and adrenaline. Someone who's normally smooth might fumble words, drop things, laugh awkwardly, fidget more in your presence. It's not that they're uncomfortable with you exactly, it's that you matter enough to activate their nervous system. This is especially noticeable if they're calm and collected with everyone else.

**they angle their torso toward you in group settings.** In conversations with multiple people, notice whose chest and shoulders face you even when someone else is speaking. This subconscious orientation shows who their attention is really on. Humans naturally orient toward what we value or desire. If someone's body consistently turns your direction while their head might be facing elsewhere, you're their priority in that space.

**their blink rate changes.** Normal blink rate is like 15-20 times per minute but attraction messes with this. Some people blink more rapidly (sign of excitement and nervousness), others blink less (intense focus and attention). Either deviation from their baseline suggests heightened emotional state. Combined with other signs, it indicates you're triggering a physiological response in them.

**they create reasons to extend interactions.** ""Oh wait, before you go..."" or ""actually one more thing..."" or suddenly remembering another question right when you're leaving. Attraction makes people reluctant to end contact. They'll manufacture reasons to keep the interaction going even when the logical conversation endpoint has passed. Notice if someone consistently finds ways to prolong your time together.

Look, these signs aren't foolproof and context matters. Someone could display a few of these and just be friendly or naturally expressive. But when you see clusters of these behaviors consistently? That's when it means something.

The tricky part is our own anxiety often blinds us to these signals or makes us misinterpret them. We either see attraction everywhere (anxious attachment style problems) or nowhere (avoidant tendencies or low self worth). That's actually a whole separate issue about learning to trust your perception while managing your own emotional responses.

Understanding attraction cues isn't about playing games or manipulating people. It's about communication. These signals exist because humans needed ways to express interest without the social risk of explicit rejection. Recognizing them helps you navigate connections more authentically and respond appropriately instead of missing opportunities or misreading situations.",1,1766807791.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

I exhaled slowly. That was it, then. I minimized the calendar and went back to my inbox out of habit more than intention. That’s when I noticed it. The original email was still there, unchanged. I didn’t open it. I didn’t click it. I just registered the bold text, the small blue indicator suggesting something still waiting. I told myself the system probably hadn’t refreshed yet. Or that secure messages behaved differently once routed internally. Or that I was overthinking it. I marked it read anyway. The indicator disappeared. I turned back to my work and didn’t look at it again. For the rest of the day, everything went exactly the way it was supposed to. I stood there for a moment longer before passing through the door myself, staring at the dark screen on the wall. Nothing about the meeting had been alarming. Nothing about it had been reassuring either. When I left the room, the hallway looked exactly the same as it had when I arrived. That, somehow, felt stranger than if it hadn’t.



We went to the restaurant down the street like we always did. Nothing special. The same booths, the same menus, the same server who never bothered to ask if we wanted water because she already knew the answer. It felt intentional, choosing something familiar on a day that hadn’t been. Everyone arrived within a few minutes of each other, coats shrugged off, bags slid under the table, that end of day looseness settling in now that no one had to be careful anymore.



“Well,” Paige said, dropping into the booth and exhaling. “That could’ve gone worse.” Riley laughed. “That’s the most ringing endorsement I’ve ever heard.” “It wasn’t bad,” Paige added quickly. “It was… official. Structured. They talked a lot about assignments. Support roles. Flexibility.” Riley nodded. “Same. They kept using words like ‘rotation’ and ‘deployment,’ which feels dramatic for a desk job, but whatever.” Caleb grinned. “I kind of loved it.” Paige raised an eyebrow. “You would.” He laughed. “What? They were clear. Clear expectations. Clear growth path. It felt solid.”



It was like everything was unfolding the way that it was supposed to.



“My meeting was quieter,” I said. “They didn’t say much. Mostly listened. Asked how I approach problems.” Paige smiled. “That’s right up your alley though” “It felt incomplete,” I added. “But not in a bad way.” Riley lifted her glass. “To incomplete meetings that don’t end in disaster and the fact that they didn’t use the word synergy.” We clinked glasses and laughed as the server passed by with a tray of drinks. The tension eased a little more. For a moment, it felt simple. It really did feel like something good. Like recognition. Like movement. Like all those years of showing up had finally tipped into momentum.



Julian hadn’t said anything yet.



Paige noticed first. She always did. “What about you?” Julian looked up from his water, like he’d forgotten he was supposed to be part of the conversation. “It was fine,” he said. The word didn’t land right. “Fine how?” Riley asked. He shrugged. “Different.” “How?” Caleb pressed, still smiling.



Julian paused, just a second too long.



“They didn’t talk about assignments,” he said. “Or timelines.”



The table quieted slightly. Not tense. Just attentive.



“What did they talk about?” I asked. Julian’s fingers traced the condensation on his glass. “How I notice things,” he said. “What I flag. How I decide something matters.” “That sounds flattering,” Paige offered. “Maybe,” Julian said. “They asked me to keep an eye on patterns. Report anything that doesn’t line up.” Riley laughed lightly and placed her hand softly on his shoulder. “That’s already what you do.” Julian smiled back, polite and restrained. “Yeah.” But something about it stayed with me. Not what he said. How carefully he said it.



The server came by then, interrupting the moment. Orders were taken. Plates arrived. Normal things reclaimed the table. We ate. We talked. We joked about wording choices and corporate buzzwords and how no one ever really knows what a meeting means until six months later. It felt good. But every so often, my eyes drifted back to Julian. He laughed when the rest of us did. He nodded along. He stayed present. He just didn’t celebrate.





I noticed it before I unlocked the door. That wasn’t intentional. I wasn’t looking for anything out of place. I was already reaching for my keys, already thinking about the quiet that came after a long day, and then my eyes noticed it.

A small box rested against my door frame. It hadn’t been shoved there or hidden. It sat neatly to one side, aligned with the wall like it belonged. A thin, clear security band wrapped around it, holding a plain white envelope flush against its side. One delivery. One unit. The box itself was matte and dark, about the size of an overly thick hardcover book. Its surface was smooth and unmarked except for a name etched into the top with precise lines of laser cut text.

**N. BENNETT**



I knew immediately that it had something to do with work. The timing matched the day. The restraint of it, no logo, no return address, no explanation, felt unmistakably institutional. This wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t promotional. It wasn’t asking. I glanced down the hallway out of habit. The overhead lights hummed softly. Someone’s door closed a few units down. No footsteps. No voices. No one waiting.

I crouched and slid my fingers under the box. The moment I lifted it, I felt a brief, sharp sting against my thumb. I flinched instinctively, more surprised than hurt. It felt like static, like brushing against something sharper than expected. I almost dropped the box, then steadied it, frowning as I turned my hand to look. There was no blood. No mark I could see. Before I could think about it any further, the box buzzed. Soft. Controlled. Deliberate. A narrow display along the edge flickered to life, and for just a second, text flashed across the screen.



**OPS C / PRELIMINARY**

**UNIT 43**

**CONFIRMED**



The words vanished almost immediately, replaced by numbers.



***ACCESS AVAILABLE IN: 09:17:42***



I stared at it, my thumb still resting against the etched lettering, my pulse suddenly very loud in my ears, my mouth gone dry.



I unlocked the door and stepped inside, closing it behind me more carefully than usual. The sound of the latch settling into place felt final in a way it never had before. I carried the box to the kitchen table and set it down gently, as if it were fragile. Or listening. Only then did I take the envelope from beneath the security band. It was unbranded. Unsealed. Inside was a single sheet of paper, heavier than standard printer stock. No letterhead. No signature. Just four lines of text.



**^(Materials have been delivered.)**

**^(Do not attempt access prior to authorization.)**

**^(Contents will unlock in sequence.)**

**^(Further instructions will follow.)**



That was all. I slid the paper back into the envelope and placed it beneath the band again, restoring it exactly the way I’d found it. The box continued counting down. Nine hours. Seventeen minutes. And change.



I looked around my apartment. The couch sat where it always had. The lamp by the window cast the same soft light across the floor. The faint crack in the ceiling waited patiently for me to trace it later. Nothing else had arrived. I don’t know why I’d expected something else to be there.

I took out my phone and opened the group chat, my fingers hovering for a moment before I let them move.



***Nicole:*** *Did anyone else just get… a box?*



The typing indicators appeared almost immediately.



***Paige:*** *YES. I thought it was a weird package mix up at first.*

***Riley:*** *I’m almost home. But you mean like… a box? Like a BOX box?*

***Caleb:*** *I’ve got one sitting on my counter right now. No logo. No return address.*

***Riley:*** *I just got home. I see mine now.*

***Paige:*** *Does yours have a timer?*



I glanced back at the display on my table, though I already knew the answer.



***Nicole:*** *Yeah.*

***Riley:*** *WHY does it have a timer.*

***Caleb:*** *Mine too.*

***Riley:*** *I kind of hate this*.



A pause followed. Not long. Just enough for the joking to run out of steam.



***Paige:*** *There’s an envelope attached to mine. Says not to open anything yet.*

***Nicole:*** *Same.*

***Riley:*** *That makes me want to open the box even more.*

***Caleb:*** *Probably standard procedure.*

***Riley:*** *That’s what they want you to think.*



Another pause.

***Paige:*** *Julian?*



The typing bubble appeared under his name. Stopped. Appeared again. Stopped. When the message finally came through, it was short.



***Julian:*** *I received something different.*



Nothing else followed. No explanation. No elaboration.



The thread kept going, but the tone had shifted. Jokes returned, thinner than before. Someone sent a meme. Someone else changed the subject. Julian didn’t come back. I set my phone down with the uneasy certainty that whatever we’d all received, it wasn’t meant to be understood together.

I stood at the sink running my hands under warm water. I checked my thumb again. Nothing. No cut. No mark. No soreness. Just skin. Still, I washed my hands twice. Then a third time, slower, like repetition might tell me something I’d missed. When I turned back to the kitchen table, the box was exactly where I’d left it. The timer continued its quiet descent.

***08:46:19***

I sat down across from it, resting my forearms on the table without touching the surface. I told myself I was just keeping an eye on it. That it’d be irresponsible not to. The box didn’t hum. Didn’t move. Didn’t react. It just waited. I thought about the meeting. The careful language. The way no one had said what this was for, only what came next. I thought about the restaurant, how easily we’d laughed, how relieved we’d all been to feel chosen instead of overlooked. I wondered if they were watching now. Not in a dramatic way. Not through cameras or screens. Just… aware.

I settled in my chair and looked around my apartment again, cataloging the ordinary like it might disappear if I didn’t pay attention to it. The couch. The lamp. The faint crack in the ceiling. I traced it with my eyes until it faded out near the light fixture. The timer ticked down. I told myself I wouldn’t sit here all night. I told myself I’d go to bed soon. Instead, I stayed where I was, listening to the hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic outside, the soft, steady passage of seconds I wasn’t allowed to control. Whatever was inside the box already knew my name.



And it was patient.



The parking lot looked the same as it always did. Same uneven lines. Same oil stains that never quite faded. Same handful of cars settling into familiar spots like they’d done this a hundred times before, because they had. Riley and I got off the bus and walked the last block together, our pace unhurried. She was halfway through telling me about something she’d listened to on the ride when we crossed the street and stepped into the lot.



She trailed off first.



“Huh.” I followed her gaze. Julian’s spot was empty. Clean asphalt where his car usually sat, angled slightly crooked no matter how many times he tried to fix it. Paige was already there, keys in hand, looking at her phone. Caleb stood a few feet away, coffee cup balanced on the roof of his car while he scrolled through something.



No Julian.



“He’s not here yet?” Riley asked. Paige didn’t look up right away. “Nope.” That was all she said, but I saw the way her brow furrowed as she checked the time again. Caleb glanced over. “Maybe he took the morning?” Paige finally looked up then. “He would’ve said something.” “Could be running late,” he offered. “Traffic was weird on my end.” Julian was never late. I didn’t say it out loud. I didn’t need to. Paige’s expression told me she was thinking the same thing. She typed something quickly, then waited. A few seconds passed. She tried again. “No out of office,” she said quietly. “No message.” Caleb shrugged, still calm, still grounded. “Could be a meeting we don’t know about.” “With who?” Riley asked. No one answered that. I pulled out my phone and opened the group chat. Nothing new. I scrolled back to the messages from the night before. Julian’s last line sat there, unchanged.



***Julian:*** *I received something different.*



No follow up. No clarification. “That’s weird,” Riley said, softer now. “Right?” Paige nodded once. “Yeah.” We stood there a moment longer than usual, like we were waiting for something to resolve itself. For a car to pull in. For a text to come through. For the gap to close. It didn’t. Paige exhaled and slipped her phone into her pocket. “Okay. We’re going to be late if we keep standing here.” Caleb picked up his coffee. “He’ll show.” We started toward the building together, our usual loose formation off by half a step. I glanced back once, just to be sure. The empty space stayed empty.





As we reached the doors, my phone buzzed in my hand. My heart skipped, and I looked down. It wasn’t a message. Not a call. Behind me, the parking lot settled into its morning quiet.



Julian’s car never arrived.



Work continued the way it always did. Emails came in. Tasks got logged. Someone asked a question in a meeting that didn’t really need an answer. I took notes anyway. It helped keep my hands busy. Julian’s desk stayed empty. No jacket on the back of the chair. No bag tucked underneath. No half finished coffee abandoned beside his keyboard. It looked untouched in a way that suggested intention, not absence. No one mentioned it. Around mid morning, as I was closing out a ticket and opening the next, my screen dimmed for a fraction of a second. Not a crash. Not a glitch. A notification.





It didn’t pop up the way emails usually did. It slid into place at the center of the screen, clean and quiet, like it’d been waiting for the right moment.

**SYSTEM NOTICE**

***Authorization Update***



I just stared at it. Then the rest of the text resolved beneath the header.



*Authorization window has been advanced.*

*Do not access assigned materials until prompted.*

*Further instruction will be delivered via a designated channel.*



That was all. No sender. No reply option. No timestamp. The notification disappeared on its own after a few seconds, leaving my desktop exactly as it had been before. I checked the clock in the corner of the screen. Still morning.

My phone buzzed almost immediately.



***Riley:*** *Did you guys just get a weird system message?*

***Paige:*** *Yeah.*

***Caleb:*** *Yep.*



I didn’t answer right away. I opened the group chat and watched the messages stack up.



***Riley:*** *Mine says the authorization window moved up. Which feels like something they could’ve told us before sending us timed boxes.*

***Paige:*** *Same wording here.*

***Caleb:*** *Probably just syncing things. Probably.*



I glanced at Julian’s name. No new messages. No reaction. Nothing. I minimized the chat and tried to refocus on my work, but my attention kept drifting back to the thought of the box sitting on my kitchen table. Still counting.

I opened my calendar without meaning to. A new event had appeared. No invitation. No accept or decline buttons. Just a block of time, placed neatly into tomorrow morning.



***REVIEW WINDOW ASSIGNED***

***Duration: 20 minutes***



No location listed. I swallowed and closed the calendar.

Across the room, I could hear Paige’s chair shift. Riley let out a quiet breath, the kind that sounded like she was trying not to laugh at something that wasn’t funny. Caleb caught my eye and gave a small shrug. No one said anything. We all went back to work.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.                                Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

1pwnwn7,https://v.redd.it/f4eu3aeszn9g1,"""Follow-Me"" Drones are the closest thing we have to Companion Droids, but they lack a body. I designed a backpack integration to solve this. Any feedback?","Hi everyone,

We know personal robot companions are coming. My thesis is that **""Follow-Me"" Drones** are currently the closest functional equivalent because they offer real utility (scouting, filming) unlike toy desk robots.

**The Missing Link:** The problem is that current drones are purely transactional tools: you unpack them, fly them, and hide them away. To become a true ""Droid Companion"" (think BD-1), a drone needs three things it currently lacks:

1. A way to ""stick around"" and have presence without flying.
2. A body to express emotion (animacy).
3. A way to hide instantly when social context requires it.

**The Design Solution:** I didn't want to shove the drone in a pocket; I wanted it to emerge on its own. I designed a backpack-integrated arm that acts as the ""body"" for the drone. It also works as a mini helipad for the drone to separate for flight, and return.

The arm isn't just a launcher; I designed it to solve four specific interaction problems:

* **The 'Parrot' Factor:** It allows the drone to perch on the shoulder, creating a sense of shared presence you don't get from a device in a pocket.
* **Animacy:** The arm acts as a 'neck.' By moving the drone relative to the user, it can look around or emote, making it feel alive even when docked.
* **Safety Clearance:** It physically separates the prop wash from the user's face during the transition to flight.
* **Social Stealth:** When entering a building, the system retracts completely into the shell so you aren't ""that guy"" wearing a robot in a coffee shop.

**My Question to Industrial Design:** I believe this form factor bridges the gap between ""Tool"" and ""Companion."" But I feel there's something missing to make this something a normal person would wear every day. Does the exposed linkage feel too ""Military/Industrial""? How would you approach the Color, Material or Finish to make this feel like **high-end apparel** rather than tactical gear?",1,1766807345.0,IndustrialDesign,0,0.67,False
1pwnwla,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1pwnwla/is_it_safe_to_live_near_grand_hope_park_in_dtla/,Is it safe to live near Grand Hope Park in DTLA as a woman?,"Hi everyone. I’m considering moving to Downtown LA and looking at buildings near Grand Hope Park, specifically 888 S Hope St and The Josephine DTLA. I’d really appreciate some honest local insight.

For context, I’m a European woman and have lived in busy cities my whole life, including London and Berlin. I’m very used to metropolitan areas, public transport, and taking normal precautions in cities.

I don’t drive, which is a big reason I’m considering DTLA. I work from home most days. The buildings in this area have great amenities, especially having a gym in the building. My day to day life would mostly be short walks nearby for coffee, lunch, and groceries. I wouldn’t be wandering far outside the immediate area.

I had a few specific questions:

- How does the area around Grand Hope Park feel in terms of safety during the day and at night?

-Is the block around 888 S Hope and The Josephine okay for short walks nearby?

-What is the Central Library like? Is it nice to use and does it feel safe since it’s close?

• I’m considering taking the Metro from 7th St / Metro Center to Hollywood and Vine for work sometimes, then Ubering to Melrose or West Hollywood. I would only take the train during rush hour or daytime. Does that sound reasonable?

• For someone without a car, does this setup make sense or would Hollywood be a better option?

I love the buildings, the look of the apartments , and the prices in DTLA. I’m trying to balance that with being realistic about safety and quality of life. I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has lived on these blocks, especially women. Thank you so much.

While many people recommend cold emails, I had more success using LinkedIn during last year’s recruiting cycle (I delayed graduation). I am willing to pay for LinkedIn Premium to send customized messages if it meaningfully increases response rates.

If I use LinkedIn, is it better to send a connection request first and then follow up by email referencing the LinkedIn outreach, or to stick to one channel only?

For LinkedIn specifically, should I ask for a coffee chat directly in the 300-character limit connection request, or wait until the connection is accepted and then ask in a follow-up message?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've got my favorite book picked out, I'm gonna take it with me and drink some coffee after I buy a bunch of medication and shit. I don't like pain, so I'll probably just take an excessive amount of painkillers, melatonin, anything I can find at a dollar general.

I even wrote my family individual letters, I haven't been able to be so honest with my opinion of them in a long time. It's been really fun. I'm not sure how to place them that they won't find them too early, but I'll figure it out.

1pwnotm,https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1pwnotm/ultimate_variety_use_tote/,Ultimate variety use tote.,"I come to the very most experts of bags in search of help. I am not a huge bag person because I lose things if I switch too much. I learned that in my 20s. I keep bags for years until they wear out when I find my fit of life stages. So I'm trying to find a happy medium now that I seem to need a work/outing bag and a daily errands one. 

I want a tote style bag that can also attach a cross body or backpack straps for long outing days. 

I want an outside pocket that can fit a travel coffee cup or my kid water bottles, think 16-20oz. 

I want a dedicated pocket for my 40oz simple modern tumbler. I don't care if that is inside or outside. That thing never leaks, not ever.

I want it to be sturdy and easy to look into. No crumpling soft sides because of soft canvas or leather or whatever. I will never find what I need when I need it doesn't  matter how many punches or pockets I have if I can't see in.

Pockets can even be minimal to none inside if can fit a bag organizer inside of it. Or even better, a  smaller, I'm just running to the store purse can be thrown in it. or both. 

I want no gold or brass hardware. I'm a cool tone or bag tone girly.

If a laptop fits then cool, if not that's okay. I mostly need papers and pens for work, stuff like cords and earbuds. For mom outing days I just need room for snacks and my daily gear. 

When I search, tons of cheap options like lovevook and other tiktok shop options pop up. cheap teacher bags with too many pockets. Or something like peonies and poppies and I've seen so many bad reddit reviews in my search about customer service  issues. Or bags that might fit the bill at $300+. I don't need a cheap $40 bag that won't last, but I think 150ish, max $200 should be a modest top range when everything is faux leather or nylon.

I can find bits and parts but none all together. tumbler pocket but no outside, all the pockets but soft and collapsible, most all of what I want with gold hardware. If I'm finding The bag I want to be happy with it.

This year it was only my parents and I for Christmas morning, as my sister was with her in-laws. We always open gifts in the morning. When I asked my parents what they wanted, they said nothing and that I should save my money. My mom added that they wouldn’t be giving each other gifts either, as they want to focus on renovating our new house. When I asked again, they said, “something for the house.”

I decided to do exactly that, but also make it something they’d enjoy. We recently renovated our bathroom, but due to a measuring mistake, our laundry basket doesn’t fit, so we don’t have one. I found one that fit perfectly and matched the style. I also thrifted a painting my dad would like, added a gift card, made a nice Canva poster to present it, and bought snacks for our festive coffee-table tradition. When they opened their gifts, they were genuinely happy, and I felt like I nailed it.

When I opened mine, I felt like they hadn’t really tried. I got a knock-off Stanley cup, even though I’ve said before that I don’t like or want one and find it impractical. Luckily it had a scratch, so I asked about the receipt. My dad said he’d take it and we could get me another. They went to the shops and sent photos for me to choose a colour. I tried hinting that I didn’t want one and said I’d look myself later.

I also got a watch. I don’t know the brand, but more importantly, I don’t wear watches and never have. I dislike how they feel and find them unnecessary since I always have my phone. They know this — I once won a smartwatch and sold it because I didn’t like it.

In my stocking I got snacks I shouldn’t eat (I’m lactose intolerant and avoiding dairy) and toiletries from brands I don’t use for specific reasons.

I feel like I should tell them about the ""Stanley"" and the watch so we can exchange them or get the money back and buy something I’ll actually use. But this has been an issue before, especially with clothing. When I’ve said I didn’t like something, I was called ungrateful and told I only want branded items. When I didn’t wear the clothes, I was told I should just wear them or give them away.

1pwnlvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/screamintothevoid/comments/1pwnlvz/almost_made_it_safely_through_the_holidays_but/,"Almost Made It Safely Through the Holidays, but Family and PTSD Prevail","I have a plan to start disappearing eventually, but I am excited to do that and I have time. I have an SOS right now though, and it is **for** this reason I have the flight plan to begin with. This was just another unxpected addition.

My family sucks (whoah, you don't say!?). It is deep and complex and too much to elaborate on the history completely, but recently my cousin has been leading the race for drama influencer of 2025. But I don't care about everyone else's bullshit. I am not influenced by it unless I feel like someone is being hurtful to my Mom, then I'll back up a bit and make some distance. Not even audibly, I'll usually just strengthen that caution tape.

So I always wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt because she came out of a pretty hard life and was able to really succeed in everything she set her mind to. She is impressive and I respect her. But I have learned that maybe she doesn't respect me.
 
She bought my Dad's house after he died there six years ago, and it feels like she lords it over me like a prize, though not intentionally. She has never once invited me to his house since his will was read (unless it was for a family event), or asked me if there was anything I wanted to keep. Just as she treats my relationship with the house, she says when and where her and I have a relationship with each other.

This Summer I came and did pet sitting (two dogs and two cats) and cleaned her house better than I found it, even repairing a fence. I hadn't even been back home after a month on the road. Now, I was more than happy to do all this, but I want to show the effort I make in helping and trying to be what a family member should be like. I even verbalized my intentions to have a closer relationship with her.

I told her I would like to be included more in her life and we discussed how we need to go through a bunch of family photos and what a great project that would be. But she also warned me that her anxiety had been bad, so I asked if she wanted to just tell me when she was ready and she said yes.

Then two months passed with no contact until she either forgot my birthday or didn't care enough to recognize it. I turned 40, so it felt pretty monumental, especially considering my previous loss of life. She texted me a day later and said she hadn't called because she wasn't feeling well lately. Later I saw she had been at the pumpkin patch with friends that week. 

*Also your hands still work when you're sick, but I won't go there. Anxiety does weird things*, but there is a limit to when you are just excusing yourself for a fuck up. Really I just wanted her to acknowledge her fuck up and say, ""I'm sorry, I didn't call you on your birthday, I have no excuse. I love you."" Adult ownership-type shit.

Since then I have just hung back, not reaching out but not ready to respond, until I called for help getting through a panic attack a few days later, and after I thanked her. Then no discussion in of or around any of the holidays since.

So now it is Christmas and my mom said my cousin wanted to bring gifts (I live with my mom). I said **I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want gifts. I needed time to address if I wanted that relationship to continue for now.** Besides, we didn't even *do* Christmas this year: no one is talking to each other for whatever reason, and I don't like the feeling of coming around suddenly just because it's a holiday, when we know there has been no other familial interaction otherwise. Can we just be real? Like, what is the point if you're not going to be around the rest of the year?

But boy, oh boy, she let my cousin come over today anyways and blindsided me with her. Didn't tell me she was coming, and didn't give me time to leave knowing already that I said I was uncomfortable with that: nothing.

Mom: *knocknock* Your cousin is here she wants to give you your gift.  
Me: Uhhh wtf no thank you?  
Mom: Well then you need to tell her. ::walks away::  
Me: No, because I already told you my feelings about this.

So my cousin came into my room and started a fight with me.

Cousin: So what you're mad at me? Since when?  
Me: No, I'm not mad I just need to work some stuff out internally until I am ready to talk and I already told my mom I wasn't okay with this.  

She goes on to tell me how selfish I am, and ungrateful, and how everyone is there for me and I am constantly shutting them out. This is 100% a projection, and my mom and I had the same conversation about these traits as being consistently hers, just days before.

It turned into a screaming match which was actually terrifying because I didn't know until just then--I just learned I can't scream anymore. Part of my PTSD involves medical trauma and I knew my voice was different now but I didn't know that I would be Ariel on land if I were ever needing to call for help. I'm actually making that connection as I write this so that's uh, neat.

Though I have a diagnosis of PTSD I haven't been with a trauma therapist for long but we have theorized about my ability to have a safe space. I always thought it was interesting and fun that I grew up in so many different houses - that I could count thirteen times my family moved by the time I graduated 8th grade. But we think it may not be the flex I thought it was, because since then I have always been running to find a safe space, and still am; Thus the plans *for* the great escape.

So I am in my room, in my mom's house which I thought was understood as **my** space as well. And she is screaming at me for being ungrateful, and wrong for not letting her berate me for answers I don't have, or engage in a surprise conversation I have repeatedly said I am not ready to have. All of this, being thrust upon me ESPECIALLY in my so-called safe space! This is unacceptable, right?

And now Mom is playing the ignore me game and I am trapped in my room processing what to say to her regarding what happened. I feel like she should have had my back and instead really threw me under the bus. I wanted and needed her to say, ""Thank you Cousin, she [insert excuse here] but I'll tell her you came by."" She could have arranged to meet and do their own gift stuff together over coffee, or at her house. Why is it okay to put me in this position? Quite literally I was caged in as she was between my dead end room and the door to leave. I don't like how I felt like a viper, begging her to back off, feeling defensive and helpless, and angry.

But she didn't make me feel safe or secure here. Goldilocks is on bedroom number 92 and still the locks don't work. Anyone's welcome! Come fuck with the girl who can't yell loud enough to tell you her needs, even though she has made them abundantly clear.

So here I am. Writing has helped, but I am utterly frozen. I started to get a bag together and thought I could go to the gym and hit something (even though I don't know how haha), or just work on my balance, and take a hot shower. But I might just wait until my Mom is asleep so I can avoid more potential conflict for the night.

Short term, I could go stay at a truck stop for a while and just lowkey move around town. I go camping fairly often: I always keep my gear in my car JIC, but I don't think it's really an option as there has been catastrophic flooding in my area. I would have to travel fairly far to be out of the valley while still close enough to meet my responsibilities in town in the coming months.

I strongly want to leave and go and not come back for a long time. I need to sell everything eventually, which will require me to come back here, and until then I have these fucking things I agreed to. I promised my mom's friend I would go tour her place and get pet sitting info on the 28th, will sit the first week of January, and again in February. I have doctor's appointments too, so I have to stay in state at least until that is all done.

But what about for now?
Would you grant yourself the escape? RIGHT NOW? and would it be okay to just GO and DO without having a plan or an explanation for anyone?

I'm frozen.  
I keep trying to explain and it is just a big circle so, I am frozen.   What do I do, void?",1,1766806483.0,screamintothevoid,0,1.0,False

To start off, I do help her. I do the laundry for the 3 of us, 4 sometimes when her cousin asks but she doesn't add much. I'll cook 1-2 days a week and/or pay for take out. I take out the trash. I take out the dog, I walk her what it's warmer. We alternate paying for coffee everyday. She washes the dishes. She cooks a majority of the time. She cleans more often. She drives if we're going anywhere together. We alternate paying for gas. She also offers to drive me places on occasion even if she isn't coming with me. I may be over looking some things but I think that's close enough for our dynamic regarding how we help eachother. 

My problem? I've been sick 3 major times this year. All stomach issues, though 1 came with a migraine afterwards. Which lead  to even more . . . never mind that. Each time she'd ask me to do something for her. Bring in the groceries, go to the laundromat, take out the trash, and the 4th one I don't remember because of the migraine. I'd decline because was sick and miserable, and I'd rather be sick and miserable while a bit comfortable in my bed. Selfish? Yes. Justified? Absolutely! However in my mother's eyes it is not. She'd say that nobody helps her. I couldn't feel even slightly comfortable after that. I forced myself to go to the laundromat but I refused to bring in the groceries or take out the trash. Well, I wasn't majorly sick during Christmas so I could help her bake cookies. She wanted to bake the cookies earlier then we did but she procrastinated but got mad at me. She dropped the line again and I fealt boiling anger. I shoved it down and helped her but something about it all made my stomach cramp up like I was sick again. Unfortunately she said it after I had my therapy appointment and I don't see her again til late January. If I don't let things out in a healthy environment I let it fester and you can read it on my face. She read it and asked me what was wrong but since we were at work I declined to answer. Later she caught me and told me to be discreet. I'm now wondering if she didn't know it was about her. To be fair, 'not at work', is code for, you pissed me off but we're not gonna discuss it at work. After work she layer into me. The gist of it being what I did wrong while baking the cookies. I cried today. I cried because I feel under appreciated. I cried remembering the seething anger and discomfort I fealt when I was sick. I love my mother, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't like me or is fed up with me when I can't control it. I know the not liking me bit is just in my head, but it sometimes feels true.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

A few months later I purchased a ten gallon tank, a heater, the four different plants you can see, snails, a food safe ceramic owl that I painted (I drink out of a mug made with the same material with hot coffee/tea, so it’s fine for fish too), and a thermometer and filter system.

I’ve been friends with Nicky since the Civil War, yes, that one. I’m a Black woman with teal hair, and no, it isn’t dyed; I was born like this. I’m also currently accompanied by an extremely annoying creature named Charlie, which was not my choice. I figured making a post from my side would be polite, or at least fair, since everyone else keeps talking. And honestly, when do you ever get time to talk to someone who isn’t part of any of this? It’s a nice change of pace.

I’m not part of the Hasher Order. I’m not part of any order, unless you count working for my boss. We call him the Shadow Man. I’ve always wanted to see what Hashers were really like. I wanted to understand why Nicky chose this path. She’s my sister by fire, but enough about her. This is supposed to be about me, and I don’t really know how to do these posts.

I work in shadows. That’s always been my lane: spirits, echoes, the things people pretend aren’t still watching. I deal with war ghosts mostly. Chains. Unfinished business. Souls that stuck around because leaving didn’t feel right yet. People always assume it’s just one war. It’s not. I move between eras more than places, and honestly, I don’t mind it. There’s something satisfying about being useful to people who were forgotten on purpose.

I can also summon help when I need it. Think Pokémon rules, but with fewer limits and way more attitude. I can do a lot more than that, but I’ll save it for another post. This is probably going to be my first and last post for a while, so thanks for letting me talk a little.

I have a shadow. Her name is Sayoka. Yes, I know it’s not creative, but when she first started acting like her own person, the first word she ever shaped was safe, and that felt important enough to keep. She’s grown since then, a little too much, if you ask me. She flirts, she lies, she acts like she’s never done anything wrong in her life, and right now she’s absolutely betraying me by flirting with Charlie.

Charlie, for the record, is a familiar. Not mine, not made by a witch, and apparently that gives him opinions. Sayoka decided this meant he needed emotional support and invited him to a familiar support group. I did not approve this, but shadows are like that once they start thinking for themselves.

I didn’t find this place by accident. I talked to a few local gangsters first, the kind the Shadow Man already owns, and they were happy to help once they realized who I worked for. They ran it through their information network: whispers, favors, things changing hands without ever touching a phone. When they handed me what I needed, I followed the trail myself.

I let the shadows spill and summoned my motorcycle like it was always waiting for me there. The engine purred the moment my hands hit the grips, familiar and comforting. I shifted my eyes, snake pupils snapping into place, and the city sharpened into lines and heat and movement. God, I love this feeling. Riding through the city with the wind cutting around me, everything made sense in motion. That’s when the wrongness crept in, familiar and tight, the same wrongness we felt that one time we ran into that place full of robots, or whatever they were supposed to be.

The feeling shifted as I got closer. Not cold. Not mechanical. More like twisted love, like someone adored contradictions so much they built a shrine out of them. Care wrapped in cruelty. Patience threaded through control. The kind of attention that watches you closely and calls it devotion. That was worse than empty. It felt personal, like the building wanted to be understood, proud of what it was hiding and patient enough to wait for the right person to notice. Someone who loved rules, then broke them. Someone who called restraint a virtue while tightening the leash another inch. I didn’t hate that feeling, which bothered me more than if I had.

When the building came into view, I slowed the bike, engine rumbling low beneath me, eyes still sharp as I tracked every line and shadow. The trail ended here, neat and deliberate, like it was always meant to. Whatever happened didn’t just start in this place. It was cherished here, shaped and protected like something precious, and that alone told me this wasn’t sloppy work.

I cut the engine and let the quiet settle, then called Sayoka forward. She slipped free like breath in cold air, spreading across the walls and sinking into the structure. I felt the tension ripple through our bond. “Take your time,” I said. “Tell me what it feels like.” She pressed deeper, tracing beams and seams that shouldn’t have mattered but clearly did. Then she signed, “Loved. Controlled. Watched.” “Yeah,” I murmured. “That tracks.”

I snapped my fingers and summoned Charlie next. He flickered in, fixed his collar, and immediately started scanning the street like it had personally offended him. “So,” I asked, glancing back at the building, “what does a proper butler do in a place like this?” “Checks the perimeter first, Lady Ayoka,” he replied. “Cameras, sensors, anything pretending it’s decorative.” He paused, frowning. “There are a lot of them. Hidden. Expensive. Whoever owns this expects obedience more than curiosity.” I smiled faintly. “That’s always a mistake.”

While they worked, I pulled my phone out and started texting. Nicky’s name popped up before I even finished unlocking the screen, talking about going shopping later, new nightclub clothes, resetting the whole vibe of the bar. I laughed under my breath and typed back, Sure. Then I added, Also, I’m at the building. The typing dots appeared, disappeared, then appeared again. She was already bracing herself.

I locked the thread, flipped to camera, and started taking pictures: the building, the street, reflections in broken glass, angles my instincts told me not to ignore. The city felt quieter through the screen, like looking at it from a step removed, which made it easier to notice what didn’t belong. “Take a few wide shots too,” Charlie said softly. “Sometimes patterns show up better when you’re not standing in them.” “I know,” I replied, backing up a step. “I just like seeing what it looks like when it thinks no one’s paying attention.” Sayoka hovered close, her shadow brushing my ankle. “It’s watching you watch it,” she signed, not alarmed, just curious. “It likes that you’re careful.” “That makes one of us,” I murmured, lowering the phone. The place didn’t feel rushed. It felt patient.

I took one last picture, pocketed the phone, and breathed out slow. “Alright,” I said quietly. “Let’s see what you’re hiding.” Then I moved closer, shadows folding in around me like they were happy to come along.

I slipped inside and let the door close behind me, slow and careful, like I didn’t want to offend it. The inside was clean, almost welcoming, which immediately put me on edge. Polished floors. Warm lights. Counters wiped down so thoroughly they still smelled faintly of citrus and soap. Cooking equipment everywhere, neatly arranged pans, labeled jars, herbs hanging from hooks like someone had taken their time. It looked lived in. Cared for. And that was the problem. Places like this shouldn’t feel loved.

Every step drew a creak from the floorboards, soft but deliberate, like the building was clearing its throat to remind me it noticed. Pipes clicked overhead. Something shifted behind a wall. Nothing rushed me. Nothing jumped out. And that somehow made it worse. I’ve dealt with scary before. Real scary. Things that want you dead and don’t bother hiding it. This wasn’t that. This felt like being invited into someone’s house and realizing halfway through the tour that you don’t know them at all.

“I don’t like this,” I said quietly. Charlie glanced around. “That’s interesting,” he replied. “This place is orderly. Clean. Statistically, you should feel safer.” “I know,” I said, swallowing as another creak rolled through the ceiling. “That’s what makes it wrong. It’s like walking into somewhere familiar, same layouts, same smells, same little comforts, but your body still knows you don’t belong.” Sayoka brushed close, her shadow curling around my calf like she was grounding herself through me. “It’s pretending,” she signed slowly. “And it’s very proud of how well it does.” That sent a chill straight through me.

We moved deeper, past storage and prep spaces, until I reached what had to be the main office. The door was ajar. Inside, the walls were covered floor to ceiling not with paperwork, not with blueprints, but with chickens. Photos. Drawings. Magazine clippings. Notes in careful handwriting. Hearts around some images like love letters. Feed ratios. Feather patterns. Wing spans. Whole boards dedicated to them like a shrine built out of obsession. “Oh,” I breathed. “Oh no.”

I started taking pictures, slow and steady. This wasn’t a hobby. This was fixation. Whatever this place was, chickens weren’t decoration. They were devotion. I knew Nicky needed to see it because this kind of love doesn’t stay harmless.

Behind me, Sayoka had both arms wrapped around Charlie, leaning into him like they were on a date instead of in a nightmare. He had one hand over hers, far too calm. “You two are acting like this is romantic,” I muttered. Sayoka sighed at me, dramatic, then turned toward the staircase. “There’s something upstairs,” she signed, suddenly serious. Before I could respond, she grabbed Charlie’s sleeve and started dragging him. “Lady Ayoka,” Charlie said, voice polite but strained, “I believe I am being escorted somewhere without my consent.” “Get used to it,” I replied, rubbing my temples. “Apparently this building likes couples.” Every creak grew louder as we climbed, like the house was listening more closely now that we’d noticed what it loved.

At the top, I told them to stay back. They didn’t argue. That alone told me they felt it too. The hallway was narrow, lights warm and steady, floor creaking just enough to remind me the building was aware of weight and movement. I’ve dealt with things that rush you. This wasn’t that. This felt curated. “Don’t like this,” I whispered.

The room at the end of the hall was colder. Chains hung from the ceiling and walls, thick and thin, all placed with intention. Tools sat on a table, cleaned and lined up like someone expected to come back and use them again. That hit harder than the chains. Care always does. I felt the pull in my chest, not fear exactly, more like grief arriving early.

Then I saw the cage. At first I thought it was empty. Then it moved. Inside was someone who’d been worked on but not finished: feathers along arms and neck, bones bent into something almost right but not quite. Human eyes, though. Fully aware. My throat tightened as I stepped closer. “It’s okay,” I said quietly, voice steady even if my hands weren’t. I reached through the bars, cupped their head gently, letting shadow slip into my words the way it does when I speak to the dead. Comfort first. Always comfort.

That’s when I realized the creaking I’d been hearing wasn’t the building. It was the dead.

“Dodge,” a voice whispered, sharp and urgent.

I moved without thinking. The creature lunged, swinging something bright and fast. A pizza cutter flashed past where my throat had been a second earlier, close enough to feel the air move. I twisted aside, boots sliding, body dropping into familiar rhythm. “Oh shit,” I breathed, ducking the swipe. I stayed light, hands loose, deflecting and redirecting, keeping distance without striking yet while I figured out what I was dealing with. It moved like it had been trained wrong: all aggression, no awareness.

Then the room clicked. Everything froze. The creature stopped mid-swing, arm locked like time got paused. The hum in the walls deepened. The lights steadied into something too calm. I backed up until my shoulders touched the wall, slow and careful, checking for traps before I looked up.

The screen turned on. A man filled it, smiling wide, proud. “Do you like him?” he asked, tilting his head. “My son. I worked very hard on him.” I kept my eyes on the screen, my body still angled toward the frozen creature. “You’ve got a strange idea of family,” I said evenly. He laughed. “You want information. Catch me, and I’ll give you more. My creations will chase you. Let’s see how you do.” His smile sharpened. “Are you chicken?” Shadows gathered close like they were listening. “No,” I said calmly. “Snakes eat chicken.” Somewhere in the building, something unlocked.

I heard them before I saw them, boots slamming down the hall. Sayoka and Charlie burst back in at a dead run, panic written all over both of them, with something feathered and clucking charging after them like it had made a personal decision. “Move,” I said, stepping aside.

The chicken thing swung hard and passed straight through them. No resistance. No impact. Just feathers, rage, and nothing else. Sayoka still yelped and dove on instinct, rolling and skidding to a stop. Charlie stumbled, swore, then froze, staring at himself like he’d misplaced something important. “…oh,” he said. The chicken tried again. Claws passed through them again. Sayoka watched the swipe go cleanly through her shadow like smoke. Then she signed, slow and offended, “We’re not solid.” Charlie snapped his fingers. “Right. Yes. That. We literally cannot be stabbed right now.” The creature hesitated like it was trying to do math. I stared at both of them. “You ran,” I said evenly, “from something that can’t touch you.” Sayoka winced. Charlie smoothed his jacket. “In our defense, it was extremely aggressive.” The chicken let out a frustrated cluck and took another useless swipe at empty air. I exhaled. “Alright. That was your free comedy moment. Let’s move before it figures out a workaround.”

Right on cue, the building creaked deeper, like it was listening. The humor drained out of the room all at once. The chickens rushed again, clucking and flailing like volume counted as strategy. I met them head-on, shadows snapping tight around my arms as I struck fast, knocking one off balance, driving the other back. Feathers flew. Claws scraped. “Charlie,” I said without looking back, “now would be a really good time.” “I am doing my thing,” he called, moving toward the computer bank with too much confidence. “Just keep them busy for a second.”

Instead of touching the keyboard, Charlie squared his shoulders, took a breath, and phased forward like he’d done it a hundred times. Straight into the computer.

For half a second, everything went wrong at once. Screens glitched. Lights dimmed. Charlie’s outline blurred like he was caught between channels. Then the system reacted violently. Sparks jumped, the console screamed, and Charlie was spit back out like the building rejected him on principle. He hit the floor hard, sliding, glitching badly, edges tearing like static. “Oh my god,” he groaned, voice stuttering. “Oh my god, that was a mistake.”

I knocked one chicken aside and dropped to a knee beside him. “Hey,” I said firmly, hands already glowing with shadow. “Stay with me.” “I know this tech,” he insisted, syllables dropping out. “I do. I do. I just… it’s not letting me be in there. There’s a field. It’s rewriting me. I can feel it.” His image stuttered, pieces of him slipping out of sync. Static crawled across his arms and neck. Sayoka snapped back beside us, panic sharp, hands flying in frantic shadow-signs.

I didn’t hesitate. I grabbed Charlie, pulled him close, wrapped him in shadow, compressed his form down, and sealed him into my earrings before the system could tear him apart completely. His signal steadied immediately, faint but holding. “He’ll be okay,” I said, more for Sayoka than myself. “I just need to find the source before it finishes what it started.”

Sayoka nodded once, swallowed hard, then split herself clean in two. Two shadow-versions peeled away and sprinted in opposite directions, laughing softly as they taunted. The chicken creatures reacted instantly, chasing the wrong Sayokas out of the room.

The moment the space cleared, I shifted. Bones folded. Skin flowed. I dropped low into snake form and slid into the nearest vent. Sayoka collapsed back into my shadow as I moved, metal scraping softly along my scales. Behind us, the building creaked again, deeper, like it was disappointed to lose sight of us.

I followed the hum through the walls, wiring, airflow, intention, toward whatever room this place didn’t want me to find. Because that’s always where the truth is.

I slid out of the vent and unfolded back into my body, boots touching polished concrete. The room was wide and elegant, nothing broken, nothing cluttered. Rows of empty chairs faced a massive movie screen, the kind you’d expect in a private theater where someone sat alone and felt important. The air smelled faintly of butter and oil, like popcorn had been made recently. That made my skin crawl. Low lights traced the floor, guiding attention toward the screen. This room didn’t creak. It didn’t complain. It waited. Sayoka stayed tight along my shadow, unusually quiet.

The screen flickered. Static hissed. Then the image snapped into focus like it had been queued up for me. The man appeared again, seated comfortably, smiling wide. “There you are,” he said warmly. “I was starting to worry you’d miss the best part.” I stayed near the wall, scanning the room while I watched him. “You’ve got a strange definition of hospitality,” I said. He laughed. “This isn’t hospitality. This is presentation. I like a clean stage.” The image cut to camera feeds: Sayoka’s decoys being chased, chicken creatures clucking through halls, then back to his smiling face. “You’re very good at moving through chaos. It’s charming.” Sayoka bristled.

“You brought me here to flatter me,” I said evenly, “or was there a reason you tried to erase my butler?” His smile sharpened. “Ah. Charlie. Don’t worry. I wouldn’t hurt one of my own. Your little friend just stuck his head somewhere it didn’t belong.” The lights dimmed slightly as the screen brightened. “If you want him back the way he was, you’ll need a cure. Simple word. Four letters.” The word CURE flashed like a title card, then broke into four blinking symbols and vanished. “Each letter has its place,” he said. “Breakers. Old-fashioned. You find them, you put him through the system, and everything goes back to normal.” He leaned closer. “Miss one, and he stays scrambled.”

“You want me running errands for you,” I said. “I want you playing the game,” he replied. “You get information. You save your friend. Everybody wins. And my creations get a little exercise.” The room hummed deeper, like the building was listening. “So are you clever enough to spell it out,” he asked softly, “or are you chicken?” I exhaled slowly. “Give me the board,” I said. “And keep talking.” The screen went dark for half a second. Then the game began.

I didn’t rush. Rooms like this reward patience. I tracked lines, shadows, places where attention lingered. That’s when I noticed the chair in the center: plain, unassuming, but wrong in the way only something important ever is. Too clean. Too intentional. I crouched, ran my hand along the underside, and felt metal instead of wood. “There you are,” I murmured.

The breaker was hidden inside the chair frame, small but heavy, marked with a single letter: C. The moment I pulled it free, the lights flickered and the air shifted like the room inhaled sharply. I touched my earrings and whispered Charlie’s name. He phased out partially, still unstable, image jittering. “Oh,” he said, voice overlapping itself. “That’s definitely a control node.” “What does C stand for?” I asked. “Context,” he replied. “Or Command. Or Capture. This system likes words that pretend they only mean one thing. Pulling that rerouted attention. We don’t have long.”

I slid the breaker into the slot he indicated. Screens went dark one by one like someone closing eyes. Somewhere deeper, something clucked in frustration. Charlie steadied enough to focus. “Okay. I’ve got a partial map. Not locations, but intent. Whoever built this is tracking targets through family lines.” “Kids,” I said. “Freshmen,” he confirmed. “But that’s not who he’s after. It’s their parents. Surgeons. Cosmetic. Reconstructive. High-profile. He’s using the kids as leverage.” I nodded. “That tracks.” Charlie flickered hard. “That’s all I can give you right now. If I stay out longer, I destabilize again.” “Go,” I told him. “You did good.” He gave a shaky smile and collapsed back into the earrings.

The breaker hummed in its housing, the letter C glowing faintly like it was satisfied. I hated that. Machines shouldn’t feel pleased, and buildings definitely shouldn’t respond to success.

That’s when I saw the map, worked into the wall, thin lines of light only visible from the right angle. The layout was simplified and wrong in subtle ways. C pulsed where I’d been. Three others remained dim and far apart. U. R. E. “So that’s how you want to play,” I murmured.

The line to U ran downward into a section the map didn’t label. No room name. No function. Just a warning hum that raised the hair on my arms. Whatever U stood for, it wasn’t meant to be easy. I touched my earrings briefly, felt Charlie steady but faint, then followed the glowing path.

The corridor sloped just enough to throw off balance. The air got heavier. The smell hit first: raw meat layered on raw meat, warm and wet. Every instinct told me I’d reached the part of the building that stopped pretending. Then the corridor opened into a vast pit.

Not water. Not solid either. A massive pool of raw meat stretched wall to wall, shredded and floating in slow waves like something underneath was breathing. Hooks dangled from chains overhead, dripping. At the center stood a tiny platform with the breaker marked U glowing steady and patient. It looked ridiculous, like a lighthouse in hell. “You’ve got issues,” I muttered.

The surface rippled. Then it broke.

Chicken sharks surged up: slick, feathered bodies, fins slicing through flesh instead of water, beaks opening on rows of teeth that did not belong. They circled, clucking low and wet, sound vibrating into my bones.

I didn’t wait. I jumped.

The moment I landed, the meat sucked at my legs like quicksand. Something clamped my calf and yanked. I went under, world turning red and choking. Meat pressed in, filling mouth and nose. Feathers brushed my face. Teeth snapped inches from my throat. Claws hooked into me and dragged me deeper while the sharks swarmed, twisting me, pulling me under again and again. Panic flashed hot and ugly.

No. Not here.

I reached deeper than I normally allow and tore something ancient loose from the shadows. “I am so glad,” I gasped into the mess, “we went to Greece.” The shadows answered.

Shadow soul sirens ripped free, not Sayoka, not gentle. Old shapes. Half-formed and screaming. Songs stolen straight from the Odyssey. Their voices tore through the pit, beautiful and violent, vibrating through flesh and bone alike.

The chicken sharks reacted instantly. Some thrashed, slamming into each other. Others turned and tore into whatever was closest, unable to resist the pull of the song. The meat churned like a storm. I was thrown upward in the chaos, breaking the surface in a desperate gasp. I clawed toward the platform, hands slipping, heart hammering, while the sirens sang like knives. I hauled myself onto the platform and grabbed the breaker with both hands. It burned hot, vibrating like it wanted to escape, but I ripped it free anyway.

The pit screamed. The meat collapsed in on itself. Sharks dissolved into scraps and shadow as the sirens hit a peak and then cut off. Silence slammed in all at once, broken only by my breathing and the slow drip of chains overhead. The sirens folded back into the shadows like they’d never existed. I bent over, shaking, soaked, alive. “Worth it,” I said hoarsely.

The breaker pulsed once, then went still. I felt the pull at my earrings strengthen as Charlie stabilized further. Still a hard fight even after that. The map in my head shifted and redrew until U lit deeper inside the building. I followed it down into the processing room, where nothing was wasted and nothing was clean. The fight turned ugly: slick floors, heavy air, too many teeth, too much noise. By the time I reached the breaker slot, my arms were shaking and my patience was gone.

Charlie phased out just long enough to finish it. He didn’t slot U into anything. He opened his mouth and ate it, light and code dissolving straight into him. His signal snapped tighter, more stable than it had been since this started, and for a second I let myself believe that was the end.

It wasn’t.

“This was never just about the letters,” he said, voice steadier now, heavier. “His real goal is Nicky.” I stopped moving. Charlie didn’t soften it. “He says if you help him betray her, if you give him information about her true nature, he’ll spare the targets. Families included.” Regret hit, quiet and heavy. Not fear. Not panic. Just the realization that every option hurt someone.

Finding R didn’t make it better. It was shoved into a janitor closet like a bad joke. Tight space, bleach and rust, cleaning supplies underfoot, feathers everywhere. I was tired by the time I tore it free, tired in my bones, tired enough to start wondering why I said yes to anything. Charlie stabilized more, voice clean enough to repeat the message like terms being read aloud. “Spare your family,” he echoed. “And he won’t tell your boss what you’re doing.” I leaned back against the wall, eyes closed, wishing I’d never taken this mission.

We were lucky to find E at all. It was wired into a tower on the roof, exposed like someone wanted it seen and reached. The climb felt longer than it should have. My head buzzed from glitch overload. Shadows lagged half a step behind me. When I tore the breaker free, Charlie steadied enough to straighten, jaw tight. “Alright,” he said. “That asshole is dying.” “No,” I snapped. “Don’t say that like this is clean.” He paused, then nodded. Information spilled out anyway, sharp and broken. “His lover’s a video cam girl. Illegal slasher. Same tier. That part fits.” “That’s obvious,” I shot back. “He performs. He needs to be watched.” “But that’s not the point,” Charlie said quickly. “That’s surface.” I stopped pacing so hard my boots scraped. “Then say it.” He met my eyes. “They’re after Nicky and Vicky. Taking them out raises rank. Unlocks files. Gets them closer to her true nature.” My stomach dropped. Heat rushed up behind it. “Of course they are,” I said. “Because nothing ever stops at just business.”

Charlie kept going, careful now. “Next target’s a nightclub. Public. Kids around. He claims they won’t be touched if you cooperate.” “If,” I repeated, laughing once, harsh. “So now I’m the leash.” “He doesn’t want blood,” Charlie said. “He wants information.” “He wants betrayal,” I said flatly.

I hit the ground hard but clean, shadows catching the worst of it and rolling me through the landing. Palms scraped. Knees barked. Then the city rushed back in like nothing happened. A car horn. Footsteps. Life continuing.

My phone buzzed. I pulled it out and froze. Not a new message. Just a picture. A car ride through the city, neon streaking past windows, dashboard lights warm. Nicky in the passenger seat, laughing at something I’d said. I’d taken it without thinking because it felt good to be there, moving forward, no knives hiding yet. I let out a short, humorless laugh. “Of course,” I muttered. “This is when I asked.”

Memory played anyway. Music low. Windows cracked. Me scrolling on my phone, bored and comfortable enough to get curious instead of cautious. What happens if they ask me to save the target by hurting you. It had felt hypothetical. Almost funny. A question you don’t expect the universe to circle and underline. Her answer wasn’t a joke: Victims come first. We come second.

That’s the rule when you join the Hashers. If you ever get a chance to save future victims, you take it. You don’t hesitate. You don’t soften it. You don’t pretend it won’t cost you something. You do it even when it hurts your crew because the alternative is letting someone else bleed later.

I paced the alley, boots crunching gravel and glass, jaw clenched as the rule settled into my bones. “Did Vicky ever do it?” I asked out loud. “Did he ever make that call?” The reply came steady like she’d expected it. Yeah. He did. I exhaled hard. “And he was just okay with it?” A beat. He knew I could handle it. I turned, frustration buzzing. “But it still hurts,” I said, voice rising. “Even if you can handle it. Doesn’t it still hurt?” No pause this time. No. Because that means I get to eat. I laughed sharp and sudden, half disbelief, half hysteria. “Unbelievable,” I said, wiping at my eyes even though I wasn’t crying. “You’re absolutely unbelievable.”

Victims first. Crew second. I took one last look at the roof I’d jumped from and headed toward a café. Warm lights. Cracked booths. Burned coffee and sugar. Normal things. I needed normal for a minute. I slid into a corner seat, back to the wall, ordered something I didn’t plan to drink, and warded my phone. Quiet work. Careful work. Shadows threaded through glass and circuitry, sealing channels that didn’t belong. “No,” I said calmly. “Not with me.”

Then I told Nicky everything. No framing. No softening. What he wanted. What he promised. What he threatened. Typing bubbles appeared immediately, vanished, then came back. When her reply came, it wasn’t hesitation. It was hunger. First a 👍. Then a gif: BIG GIRLS DON’T CRY. Then the words that made my chest tighten, not because they were cruel, but because they were certain: Victims come first. I come last. Send him the one that does the least damage.

I stared too long. She didn’t ask for reassurance. Didn’t push back. She wasn’t scared. She was waiting, like a predator settling in while the trap finished closing. That was the part that scared me. Not the betrayal. Not the lie. The fact she was already measuring how hard she was allowed to bite.

That’s when I cried. Quiet. Ugly. Tears slid down and hit the table. I wiped them with the heel of my palm and breathed until the shaking stopped. This wasn’t fear. This was weight. This was knowing exactly how dangerous someone you love really is, and choosing to love them anyway.

I sent the slasher exactly one truth. One nature. Wrapped in myth instead of confession, sharp enough to satisfy curiosity without opening the door all the way. Velicor, the Heart-Binder. La Seraphe Noir. A Cupid variant. Not the soft kind. The old kind. Bonds instead of arrows. Devotion instead of romance. Love enforced, not invited.

The response came almost immediately. Okay. They’re safe. I’ll text you. Or you’ll find the clue to my place.

I locked the screen and exhaled slow. Charlie surfaced briefly. “You know Vicky is going to feel this anyway.” “I know,” I said. “But he doesn’t need to hear it from you.” The café kept humming. Plates clinked. The door chimed. Normal life walking past something dangerous without realizing how close it had come.

After that, I didn’t wait. I opened a new thread and typed Viktor and the Shadow Man at the same time. We need wards across the city. Not later. Now. Then the part that mattered most: Do you know what nature I just let that slasher have.

The line didn’t come back right away. I waited, thumb tracing a shallow chip in the wood. Steam curled up from a cup I still hadn’t touched. Burnt coffee, sugar, something fried in the back. Then the thread lit up.

V: Which one.  
TSM: Yeah… I mean, no. Which one.  
V: You can’t just say that and not specify. That sentence has consequences.  
TSM: We talked about this. This is exactly why we agreed not to hand out her natures like party favors.  
Me: I didn’t hand it out. I rationed it.  
V: That’s not better.  
TSM: Alright. You still have options. You could pivot. Walk it back. Choose another manifestation. We’ve got the Thorned Mercy, the Mirror Hunger, the Salt Bride—  
Me: No.  
V: Absolutely not the Salt Bride. Last time that happened, we lost three blocks and a church.  
TSM: That church was already condemned.  
Me: Stop. Both of you. This isn’t a menu. You’re not swapping loadouts.  
Me: I already sent it. One nature, wrapped in myth. It fits what he thinks he’s hunting, and it doesn’t crack her all the way open.  
V: Which one.  
Me: Velicor, the Heart-Binder. La Seraphe Noir.  
TSM: Yeah. Okay. No. I hate that. But I get it.  
V: Of course that’s the one you picked.  
Me: It’s annoying because it doesn’t kill fast. It drags. It makes people hesitate, confess, circle their own wants until they fold in on themselves.  
Me: It feeds on attraction instead of fear. Obsession. Fixation. Stress spirals. And yes, sometimes it ends in heart attacks when mortals push themselves too far trying to resist it.  
Me: It’s the easier nature. He’s mortal. This one hurts him without turning the city into a crime scene.  
TSM: That does sound like her.  
V: Alright. Then we ward the city like she’s already stretching.  
TSM: Agreed. Full perimeter. No shortcuts.  
Me: Thanks. And just so we’re clear, if this goes sideways—  
V: It was always going to.  
TSM: And you still chose the least catastrophic option.  
Me: Good. Because she’s already hungry.

No one replied. And that silence told me everything I needed to know.

The silence didn’t last.

My phone vibrated once, sharp and wrong, screen flickering like the call didn’t care about settings or permissions. The café noise dulled, like the world leaned away to listen. Then Vicky’s face filled the screen.

He didn’t look angry at first. That was worse. His eyes were sharp, focused, like he already knew most of the answer and was waiting to see how much I’d lie. I glanced at my earrings. “Charlie,” I said flatly. He didn’t surface. Didn’t glitch. Didn’t warn me.

Vicky noticed. “Charlie didn’t tell me shit,” he said, voice low and dangerous. “Which is impressive, because I can still feel it.” I swallowed, fingers tightening around the phone. “I can feel you used Nicky,” he continued, slipping between English and Spanish as his control thinned. “No details. No play-by-play. Just pressure. Like someone twisted a lock they weren’t supposed to touch.” “That wasn’t—” I started. He cut me off. “You were in Miami. Not the point. But what the hell, Ayoka.”

His gaze flicked like he was checking something internal, instinctive. Then his jaw tightened. “You don’t poke a nature like that unless you mean to wake it up,” he said. “And I can feel her shifting.”

I glanced at the quiet thread again, then back at Vicky. “I chose the least catastrophic option,” I said. “On purpose.” He stared a long beat, then let out a breath halfway between a laugh and a growl. “Of course you did,” he said. “And of course it still went to hell.”

The screen crackled, call destabilizing as something on his end pushed harder. “Stay reachable,” he said. “And if she starts hunting—” The screen went black.

I stared at my reflection, heart pounding as café noise rushed back in. I looked down at my earrings again. Then I muttered, for only myself to hear, [“Oh fuck.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pvh408/hasherverse_ep29_grandpa_vicky_clears_the_room/)",1,1766806003.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,0.67,False

1pwnfnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/1pwnfnd/new_qrevo_curvx_keeps_getting_trapped_with/,"New Qrevo CurvX keeps getting ""trapped"" with nothing around?!?!","I'm on the 3rd day into my new CurvX and getting really frustrated, while waiting on tech support I'm curious if anyone else has had this experience.

The robot keeps stopping mid-clean, spinning in circles, then reporting itself as trapped. There's absolutely nothing trapping it and no people/pets in the room. Other times it reports a cliff sensor error (Error 4), when there is nothing that it could fall off of. When I find it, I move it a few feet away and about half the time it repositions and then starts going again, the other half of the time it just goes back into a 360 degree spin cycle not going anywhere until it reports being trapped again. 

I've tried sending it back to the dock, pausing and restarting, power cycling and it just keeps happening in different places every time. I've come home to it trapped just inches in front of the dock and another time trapped partially inside of it. I've repeatedly wiped the sensors when it tells me and eventually did a factory reset and re-mapping of the house. During both the initial mapping and the re-mapping it has gotten stuck on bare floor and just spun in place for > 5 minutes until I manually moved it.

I've started taking photos when its reporting as trapped, just a few are shown here (see photo 1). The other instances are almost all the same just different areas of bare floor. Only once did it get trapped on one side by the coffee table legs. It could have just turned in any other direction and gotten itself out. Instead it would spin around 360 degrees in place and then just keep ramming forward into the legs until it eventually gave up. It was honestly sad to watch it be so dumb. Photo 2 shows the docking area where it's self reported as trapped where clearly there is nothing blocking it.

I'm debating just flat out returning if this is a common issue, but up for replacing if it seems more like a defective unit. When it does run correctly, I've been really pleased with how it handles the daily dog hair and dog dirt. I'd give it 8/10 for vac work and 7/10 for mop work. I bought it to free us of daily floor cleaning tasks, but the amount of time I have spent tending to its navigation issues I could have just deeply cleaned the floors myself everyday.

1pwneau,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1pwneau/a_message_from_the_future/,A message from the future…,"I am meant to graduate in May with my PhD in English - Creative Writing (CNF). I have taught first year comp for 8 years, both as part of my TA-ship and as an Adjunct at my Alma mater and elsewhere.

I’ve applied to a few relatively local positions for Fall of 2026, some TT, some NTT.

I am a teacher’s teacher. I pursued a PhD because of my love of teaching, not research or academia. I think I was a great teacher. My students loved me AND walked away with progress, perhaps the holy grail of teaching.  But my heart isn’t in it anymore. What was once strength is now exploited as weakness. What was once “she creates a sense of community I don’t feel in my other classes and expects more of me than I knew I was capable of but I’ve found I am” is now “she has unreasonable standards and thinks by being nice and friendly those standards can be faked as reasonable”. I can see the writing on the wall. 

While my current focus must be on finishing my memoir-dissertation, a seed has been planted for my next big creative project - a fictional memoir from the future, from 2052 when we have all long rolled over for AI and climate change is now climate is. When all is lost but some of us still hang on.

I thought I’d share my first chapter of that creative venture. See how it resonates. I’ll provide some more important context in a week or so.



The Archivist’s Memoir
Chapter One: Attendance

I wake before the alarm because the grid still runs on habit. The alarm goes off anyway, two minutes late, because the update last month never finished installing and no one knows how to fix it without voiding something called legacy compatibility.

My townhome is dark. The boiler clicks uncertainly, pauses, then tries again. Outside, the streetlight flickers between orange and white, like it’s undecided about what decade it belongs to. It rained overnight. Everything smells faintly electrical and wrong.

I dress without thinking. Black jeans. Soft sweater. Shoes thick enough for puddles and broken glass. I check the campus alert app out of reflex. No alerts. There are never alerts anymore. The system flags everything as low priority now. A fire in the chem lab, a fight in the food hall, an armed man in the Peace Quad…all has coalesced.

The walk to campus should take twelve minutes. Today it takes longer because the main intersection is frozen in all-red. Cars have formed a polite, confused knot. No one honks. No one remembers the rules. Eventually a student jogs through the crosswalk, waving, and the cars follow her like she’s invented something new.

I pass the same houses. The same dogs being walked by people staring into their palms, murmuring corrections to machines that misunderstand them. The frat house on the corner still has a couch on the porch, its cushions split open, springs rusting into lace. Someone spray-painted FREE WIFI on the armrest years ago. It’s never been removed.

Campus rises slowly, pretending not to be a border. The brick buildings look intact because brick ages politely. The banners advertising excellence are sun-faded, their slogans truncated mid-sentence where the vinyl peeled. It’s beautiful actually, compared to the hundreds of campuses that closed in the last two decades.

Inside my building, the elevator is down again. A printed sign is taped to the door: TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE. The date underneath is old enough to feel intentional. I actually can’t remember how it felt to last be carried up a floor or two. No one knows how to fix it anymore, so we just climb.

My classroom smells like marker ink and damp coats and the burnt sweetness of cheap coffee. Twenty-two desks. Twenty-two screens. Half of them show the login screen that never loads unless you jiggle the power cable just right. Someone has written instructions on the whiteboard and underlined them three times:

If frozen, wait.

“Good morning,” I say to the quarter of my class that has arrived on time, and my voice echoes slightly because the sound dampeners were removed during a cost-saving initiative and never replaced.

We begin with a freewrite. Five minutes. No prompts. Just write.

This used to feel radical. Now it feels ceremonial.

Pens move. Keys click. One student stares at her screen as it buffers, the spinning icon reflected in her glasses. Another writes by hand because he says the cloud eats his work. A third whispers into his wrist, trying to coax a paragraph into existence.

I walk the aisles, not reading, just confirming that bodies are present. Attendance is no longer about learning. It’s about proof of continuity.

When time is up, no one volunteers to share. Vulnerability has been algorithmically downgraded. It is not worth the mental health cost.

I talk about voice. I tell them it isn’t style, it’s pressure. That it’s what leaks through when you don’t optimize. I use words they’ve been told not to trust: struggle, uncertainty, risk. I see several students glance at the ceiling, where the classroom recorder blinks red, recording nothing anyone will ever watch.

A student raises his hand. He asks if voice matters when clarity is faster.

Behind him, the projector flickers and displays a slide from last semester’s class, frozen mid-bullet point. No one notices.

“It matters,” I say, because I still believe this counts as teaching.

The second class is louder, more restless. Someone eats chips from a bag that sounds like aluminum foil being tortured. Someone else laughs at a video with no sound. I talk about revision. About staying with a sentence after it disappoints you. About resisting the flattening.

A student interrupts to ask if using AI to revise is allowed now that the rubric auto-scores anyway.

Allowed. The word doesn’t mean what it used to.

“We can talk about that,” I say, which has become a professional survival phrase.

By noon, my throat hurts in the particular way that comes from translating grief into neutral language.

I eat lunch in the faculty lounge because it is there and because leaving campus feels like surrender. The microwave hums ominously, then stops halfway through reheating my soup. No one tries to use it again.

Three colleagues sit around the table, phones face-down like exhausted animals. Someone mentions a student who emailed after grades posted, asking if there was “anything quick” they could add. Someone else laughs, a short bark, and says deadlines are just vibes now.

Another colleague says her niece is graduating this spring and doesn’t know basic history. Says she only read excerpts. Says her longest paper was shorter than a take-home exam used to be. Says the grades are excellent. Says this with the stunned tone of someone reporting weather from a planet they thought was fictional.

We nod. No one argues. Arguing would require believing there’s still a lever to be moved somewhere.

The conversation drifts, as it always does, to policy. To detection tools that don’t detect anymore. To revision histories that can be manufactured, scrubbed, performed. To students who lie without blinking, who escalate complaints like customer service requests, who speak the language of efficiency fluently and the language of responsibility not at all.

Someone mentions a colleague who was let go last week. Another one. A teacher who knew names, who stayed late, who still believed in books. The explanation was budgetary. The silence afterward was not.

When the meeting starts, the chair thanks us for our flexibility.

The agenda is long and oddly cheerful. Retention initiatives. Streamlining assessment. Scaling feedback. A slide appears showing improved outcomes. No one asks how those outcomes are measured. Sad side-eye glances are made at the forgotten AI prompt at the bottom of the slide. Most of us have forgotten to delete a prompt or two.

A junior colleague asks, carefully, whether we should reconsider fully automated grading for writing courses.

The room goes still in the way it does when someone has said the unsayable but not loudly enough to be brave.

The chair smiles and says adaptation is part of professionalism now.

We move on.

Office hours begin on schedule, like a ritual we keep performing to prove we are still here. I scrunch down in my chair like it might offer some protection, like it might hold me in when I explode.

The first student arrives early. She sits carefully, hands folded, eyes bright with effort. She tells me she loves writing but feels like she’s failing at it. That her essays sound perfect and empty. That she can’t tell where her thinking ends and the assistance begins, that she’s not sure Chat is helping so much as holding her back.

I ask her what she writes when no one is watching.

She hesitates.

“You mean… offline?”

The second student is defensive before he sits down. He insists the flag is wrong. That originality is statistical anyway. That the system mirrors his thinking because his thinking is that good.

I ask him to explain one sentence to me. Just one. In his own words.

He scrolls. The sentence disappears. He says he meant to delete it.

The third student doesn’t bring a paper. He brings a question. He asks why we still write essays when no one reads them and everything important seems to be decided somewhere else, by something else.

Outside my window, a maintenance truck idles, its hazard lights blinking out of sync, one bulb burnt out entirely.

“It matters,” I say, and this time I mean: because we are still pretending we know how to know.

When office hours end, the scheduling system crashes and logs my availability as unlimited. I do not correct it.

The rain has returned. Not dramatic. Administrative. It leaks through seams no one budgets for.

On my walk home, the traffic lights are still frozen. Someone has tied caution tape around the pole, like a ribbon on a grave. Cars inch forward on instinct alone.

My crying starts halfway down the block. Quiet. Unprofessional. Rain on rain. Salt dissolving into everything.

I cry for my students, who are maybe not lazy, just trained out of effort. I cry for my colleagues, who are still doing the work of three people with half the protection. I cry for the scaffolding we left standing after removing all the ladders.

By the time I reach my door, the crying has thinned into something like resolve, or fatigue, or both. Inside, the power flickers, then steadies. The system hums, proud of itself.

Tomorrow, I will wake before the alarm again.

And I will go.

Chapter Two: Syllabus


WRIT 101: INQUIRY, CRAFT, AND THE PRESENCE OF EVIDENCE
============================================================

Instructor:   Safi Anderson, Ph.D.
Office:       Room 214, Emergent Studies Building
Office Hours: Mon/Wed 1:30–3:30 PM (in person) or by appointment (synchronous only)

------------------------------------------------------------
COURSE DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Writing is not output. It is not a product, a prompt response,
or a statistical approximation of clarity.

In this course, we will practice writing as a human act of
inquiry: asking questions that matter, sustaining thought
through difficulty, and revising in response to evidence.

This syllabus does not pretend automated systems do not exist.
It insists that you remain responsible for your thinking,
your language, and your choices.

------------------------------------------------------------
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Develop and sustain claims through coherent argument
- Engage sources as conversations, not authorities to copy
- Demonstrate revision as a process of rethinking, not polishing
- Articulate the difference between assistance and authorship
- Reflect honestly on how their writing is produced

------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED MATERIALS
------------------------------------------------------------

- One composition notebook (handwritten work required)
- Access to library databases (print or digital)
- Course readings posted on LMS
- Willingness to write more than once

------------------------------------------------------------
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. LOW-STAKES WRITING + REFLECTION (20%)
   Short drafts, reading responses, in-class writing.
   These are process documents. They are not optimized.
   They are not graded for polish.

2. MIDTERM ESSAY: QUESTION AS ARGUMENT (20%)
   - Exploratory draft
   - Evidence of process (notes, version history, drafts)
   - Self-assessment addressing rubric criteria

3. RESEARCH-INFORMED ESSAY (30%)
   - Research question with intellectual stakes
   - Annotated source list or research notes
   - Multiple drafts showing revision decisions
   - Reflective statement on writing choices

4. FINAL PORTFOLIO (30%)
   - Revised major assignments
   - Reflective essay on growth and process
   - Disclosure of any automated tools used or refused

------------------------------------------------------------
POLICY ON AUTOMATED ASSISTANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

Generative tools can produce fluent text. Fluency is not
thinking.

You may use automated tools ONLY IF ALL of the following
conditions are met:

1. DISCLOSURE
   You must disclose tool use in writing, explaining:
   - what was generated
   - what you accepted, rejected, or revised
   - why you made those decisions

2. PROCESS EVIDENCE
   Every major assignment must include visible process:
   drafts, notes, handwritten work, or version history.

3. REFLECTION
   You must reflect on your authorship. Outsourcing thinking
   and presenting it as your own is academic misconduct.

Failure to meet these conditions may result in a zero and/or
referral to Academic Integrity review.

Detection software may be used, but no penalty is assigned
without human review and conversation.

------------------------------------------------------------
GRADING PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------------------------------------

Grades are based on:

- Depth of engagement
- Clarity of reasoning
- Evidence of revision
- Ethical source use
- Accountability for process

I do not grade perfection. I grade thinking over time.

------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Attendance is not simply physical presence.

Participation means engagement with the work of writing:
drafting, revising, questioning, and responding.

You cannot participate through text you did not author.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORT AND ACCOMMODATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

This institution is operating under strain.

If you need academic, personal, or technical support, reach
out early. Silence after deadlines limits what can be done.

------------------------------------------------------------
SELECTED COURSE ARC (SUBJECT TO CHANGE)
------------------------------------------------------------

Weeks 1–2:  Writing as Inquiry
Weeks 3–4:  Reading as Conversation
Weeks 6–7:  Developing Research Questions
Weeks 9–10: Revision Workshops (in person)
Weeks 12–13: Ethical Use of Tools
Weeks 14–15: Portfolio Conferences

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL NOTE
------------------------------------------------------------

This course resists speed.

You will be asked to slow down, to write sentences you can
explain, and to mean what you submit.

There is no automation for understanding.

There is only practice.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I assume I either have HI or SIBO, it almost seems like they counteract with each other or even are the same almost. I struggle to do any probiotics as it causes bloating and gasses after taking such as saurkraut, kimchi, kombucha. I haven't tried kefir yet because I am scared how ill react to it or yogurt. This all started happening when I cut out coffee as I was having weird stomach problems for 10 months after quitting stimulants such as nicotine pouches and pre workout and energy drinks. Only thing I kept drinking was coffee up until 1 week ago. I switched to carnivore diet because my stomach goes through crazy symptoms now. Turkey dinner was a nightmare as I had to go straight to the washroom after. However, I didn't eat clean I had a bunch of olives, mashed potatoes, kombucha, salad, etc. 

I am now sticking to steak fresh grass fed, eggs, bacon and bone broth with ginger and turmeric. This has lowered my bloating and majority of my issues. Also intermittent fasting. But I am worried to implement new foods now or wait a month?

Also get dandruff abd itchy scalp not sure if related, also sometimes vertigo like sudden dizzy spells but they're quick.

1pwn1wb,https://i.redd.it/ii0uf98wxn9g1.jpeg,Will is an unreliable narrator and how his coming out could parallel Mike getting Vecna'd (theory (?)),"English isn't my first language so it might sound rough in places.
I wrote about the coming out scene, Will being an unreliable narrator, the Tammy parallel and how Vecna might target Mike during the last mission and how that could lead to Byler.
This is a bit long but I promise all the parts are important for the point I want to make. I also don't know if this even counts as a theory but anyway. We still have an episode to get byler and honestly, I've been 'delusional' for so long, what's another week?
Also credits to my friend u/IAMMIKEQUEELER she helped me with this and wanted me to credit her.



Will's Coming out scene 

- it's bad at first sight but important for the plot 
- --> Will knows Vecna uses people's fears/insecurities against them (like he did to him in episode 4), in his case his homosexuality and how the group could react badly if they found out so he comes out to them to see how they would really react before Vecna has the chance to expose him and make him think they react badly 
(like how Vecna made Max think Lucas turned against her in season 4)
-----> MIKE DOESN'T know/expect this, he's never been targeted before (not like ALL the other Wheeler's)
--- we never see Mike's POV because it would spoil his feelings for Will and they might plan on revealing these when Mike is targeted by Vecna is episode 8

(The duffer brothers love slow burns untill the very end & might want to misguide us with all these recent interviews and the Tammy situation (more about that in another paragraph) so Mike's realisation and Byler love confession hits harder for everyone, including those who already shipped it)


Will is an unreliable narrator

(We see this at rinkomania// his POV: Mike and Jane seem happy, Angela's POV/the truth: they seem awkward/not laughing nor talking)
- We didn't get to see the sequence that Vecna (supposedly!) showed Will the second time Will tapped into the hive mind (the one in episode 6 where he fell unconscious) 
---> at the beginning of episode 6 it is revealed Will built the tunnels and at the end Will tells Jane Vecna knows where max is 
-- it is bad writing for Will to talk about the sequence with the other charactersand and for us not to see it (no emotional payoff), because if it's important the viewers should be showed. (And it is important because at the end, this was his final reason/motivation to actually come out and why he did it in front of the whole group)
UNLESS that's the whole point. If we assume Will is unreliable this could be a plot twist in some way. (I'm not sure how yet, if you have any ideas please share)


Will thinks Mike is his Tammy but that's not necessarily true 
-- he lies to himself about his own feelings (season 3 ""I'm not gonna fall in love""--> a lie, he already was in love with Mike at this point/ at least started to have feelings for him.)
He basically tries to tell himself it's ""not that deep"" so it doesn't hurt as much as it would if he accepted the truth. Mike isn't just a passing crush for Will, not just someone at school he sjares a few classes with --> Mike is Wills best friend since kindergarten, Mike was in his 8mm childhood film, Mike makes Will actually feel loved
-- he's bracing himself for rejection/accepting it before it even happens so Vecna can't use his heartache against him in the final fight so he isn't weak

(So yeah, again, maybe the duffer brothers want to rage bait us on purpose so we are even more happy/relieved when byler happens)


Mike is not only Will's weakness, but also Jane's. (Even if you don't ship Mileven, you have to agree their bond is still strong)


---> Final theory: Vecna will target Mike using his internalised homophobia. He will get into Mike's mind using this fear/insecurity to hurt/attempt to kill him to scare/distract Will and Jane at the same time. Since Mike is really important to both of them Vecna could easily distract Will and Jane with one blow. (If I were him that's what I would do lowk)
Also: maybe he already has been watching Mike? I've seen people already talk about this, how Mike drinks lots of coffee and just generally zones out a lot. This would explain his numbness/emotionless behaviour a bit.

Other side points to cure your Byler doubt
- no plot twist yet
(The duffer brothers said they love a good plot twist, but there haven't been any yet. And let's be fr, the wormhole theory was obvious/very foreseeable)

1pwn0x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightlossJourney/comments/1pwn0x4/working_on_longterm_goals/,Working on long-term goals,"I’m an almost 29yo woman with PCOS, lucky enough to be a mother of 4. I am exclusively breastfeeding my youngest who is 5 months old just as I have done with all my children. Breastfeeding calculators with his age and weight say that he is consuming around 900 calories a day from me.

I am unfortunately close to 100lb overweight for my height. I’ve been this way for a decade, with nearly no weight gain in my pregnancies (and any minimal weight gain from my pregnancies has always fallen off within a week after birth). BMR is around 1800 calories. BMR + breastfeeding is 2700 calories. 

Despite being overweight, my health is actually good (blood sugar, liver, thyroid). I keep an eye on that religiously because my dad is Type 2 with NAFLD.

I’ve struggled with losing weight at all. I dieted a lot in my early 20s, no success beyond the 1 month I did the 800 calories a day diet (yes, I am aware now how stupid and dangerous that was).

I worked on my mental health and have gotten to a place where I want to lose weight not because of how I look, but because of what I want to model for my children. I grew up with my dad being overweight and his parents. I also am not happy with the thought of being fat and elderly. My father’s parents are very overweight and 80, life is rough on them. I no longer care about how the world views me, but gosh I am so nervous about what I will FEEL like as I age!

I started having back problems in my teens before I gained weight. Unfortunately all my siblings are the same way, all smaller than me with 2 of them being a healthy weight or underweight. My dad’s side of the family has a myriad of back issues with nearly all of them having multiple back surgeries. I am very aware that when I get into my 40s or 50s that back surgery may very well be something that I have to do. After seeing my grandparents and my dad struggle with recovery and being overweight, I do NOT want that same struggle. I would rather have the normal struggle of recovery.

My joints have started hurting before it rains and I’m feeling like an old lady. We recently went to a theme park, and the last ride (a small child’s ride no less) jerked in an usual way (not normal as we had ridden the ride many times because of the kids), and my back is still feeling tweaked because of it.

I already struggle with shoulder, neck, and head pain because of the size of my chest. Even if losing weight changes that just a little, I would absolutely love that.

Overall, my goal is give myself the future that future me deserves. I cut soda out (ugh, Dr Pepper is such a vice!). We are actually doing a multigenerational homestead and live very rural, so fast food is not an option. I am the primary cook and I do not buy ultra-processed foods. What has a very tight grip on this household is sweet tea. We live in the South, it is in our blood. We make it (1 cup sugar to a gallon or 1 tablespoon sugar to 8oz) or buy it (Milo’s). Coffee is simple, my husband is Cuban and makes cafecito or cafe con leche, which we have most mornings (but not every morning, including this morning). We do buy pulp orange juice (the more pulp the better), no added sugars obviously.

But sweet tea… that’s my biggest struggle right now. I’m one of those lame people who “doesn’t like water”. Especially in the morning. For some reason, it makes me nauseous. I have tried different temps, I have tried with fruits added, water in the morning just really turns my stomach. I am a very easy puker (hyperemesis with all my pregnancies), and I have genuinely gagged to the point of water coming back up while drinking it. YES I KNOW HOW STUPID THAT IS. I am painfully aware and extremely frustrated about it.

I think if I could become a water drinker, that it would really help me lose weight. I know that I’m drinking calories, and to compensate I usually skip breakfast. I am currently about 10 pounds less than my pre-pregnancy weight (so I guess about 2 pounds a month loss while breastfeeding), but I would like to change that to about a pound a week.

1pwmzht,https://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/1pwmzht/want_to_understand_meaning_of_life_here_is_that/,want to understand meaning of life ? here is that purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Mine is simple: finding someone to correspond with. It can be on Reddit Chat, KIK, Telegram, email, and heck, even Morse Code.

The one who has absorbed enough useless knowledge can talk on anything. I am open-minded and will research things. I just cannot believe something as fact. I admit I am a geek/nerd. I collected comic books as a kid, watch to much Anime, have models of WW2 aircraft, and a “few” Japanese swords.

I’m going to wrap this up, as I am likely having too many eyes going ugh, another loser. Hey, I am sure some readers have said that in their heads, if not out loud. I get it I am not the person all would want to correspond with. I prefer Black Tea over Coffee. (Fighting words I am sure)

Also this is random, but when u get an iced drink theres a customer self serving area where u can get a straw, sugar ect. Even tho usually customers are meant to get a straw themselves, he always gets it and prepares it for me ontop of my cup so i dont have to do a thing- which isnt standard.

I met a male coworker (25M) from another department about two months ago. He heard me talking to another male colleague and he interjected in the conversation to ask me a question about something I said (that’s how we met). I asked if he had a card. He didn’t have one, so he proceeded to ask two of his nearby coworkers if they had one. When they both said no, I offered my card and he accepted it. I was surprised when the next business day I actually heard from him with the information I had requested. 

We’ve only been around each other twice, but during those times I noticed he teased me (jokingly), kept eye contact so intense I felt the need to look away, he would ask questions about my job/office/duties but didn’t seem to ask anyone else about theirs (as far as I’m aware of), supported my opinions and ideas to the focus group each time, offered to grab a group of us coffee while staring directly at me, has smirked at me after I teased him back, and apologized directly to me in person after an email delay. He also had asked if I’d be at the next meeting and offered to stay behind to help me work during lunch on something (until he realized he had a calendar conflict). Our last goodbye was a little awkward because he wouldn’t really look at me but smiled kind of oddly and told me to have a good night after we left the meeting. 

He oscillates between seeming confident/normal and nervous/awkward/terse when I’m interacting with him. I emailed him and asked him if he wanted to meet sometime to talk something business related, and he accepted, suggesting a specific week (had to be pushed back a bit for the holidays). We meet in a few days, the first time it will be just us (at a coffee shop), and I’m just not sure how to view his possible interest before going in for this meeting. I want to flirt with him, let him know it’s reciprocated, but with it being work, I’m a little nervous of my perception being off.

# What Is the Manus 1.6 AI Agent?

**Manus 1.6 AI Agent** is a next-generation AI automation system built around *projects* and *connectors*.

Instead of asking for one-off tasks, you can create an AI workspace that handles daily workflows for you.

You can say things like:  
“Check my email, summarize updates, save them to Notion, then schedule a reminder on Calendar.”

And Manus will do all of that automatically.

It’s like Zapier — but powered by an AI brain.



# How Manus Connectors Actually Work

Connectors turn your AI agent into a digital operations assistant.

You can now link your:

* Gmail
* Google Drive
* Calendar
* Notion
* Slack
* Canva
* ZoomInfo
* Stripe
* Xero

Once connected, you can trigger automations that run in the background — even while you’re offline.

That means your AI can send emails, schedule meetings, and build reports all without you touching a keyboard.



# Building My First Project With Manus 1.6 AI Agent

I started by creating a project called “Daily AI News Brief.”

Here’s what it does:  
Every morning at 8 a.m., Manus automatically searches the web for the top 5 AI news updates, summarizes them, and saves the summary in a Google Doc.

Then it emails me the link — all before I’ve had my first coffee.

It even built the folder in Drive and formatted the document automatically.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t just a productivity update — this was full-scale automation.



# Automating an Entire Workflow

Next, I tried connecting Manus to Google Calendar.

I gave it a simple task:  
“Create a calendar event for my live stream today at 4 PM and send an invite to my Gmail.”

Within seconds, it:

* Created a Calendar event with the title and details.
* Sent an email invite using Gmail.
* Added the recording reminder to Drive.

I didn’t touch anything.

It just worked.

That’s what’s crazy about **Manus 1.6 AI Agent** — it can use multiple connectors *in the same project*, chaining them together like human workflows.



# Advanced Automations You Can Build With Manus 1.6 AI Agent

You can build automation stacks like this:

* **Daily Research Briefs:** Automatically summarize AI updates and email yourself.
* **Client Reporting:** Pull data from analytics, export to Sheets, and share a Drive link.
* **Social Posting:** Draft posts, upload visuals via Canva, and publish using connected APIs.
* **Team Alerts:** Post daily updates or Slack reminders across your team automatically.

Each project is reusable.

You just click “Run,” and your agent does everything for you.



# How Connectors Transform Workflows

Before this update, Manus could run tasks individually.

Now, you can chain them — Gmail to Drive to Calendar to Slack — like a flow.

It’s what I call *agentic automation*: one AI coordinating multiple tools like a real assistant.

This is where the **Manus 1.6 AI Agent** stands out — it bridges human workflows and autonomous execution.

It doesn’t just “help.”

It *handles*.



# Manus + Claude = The Perfect Pair

To generate ideas for my workflows, I paired Manus with Claude 4.

I asked Claude to brainstorm automation ideas — then plugged those prompts into Manus.

For example:  
“Pull top AI news, summarize, save to Drive, and post to LinkedIn.”

Claude handled the strategy.  
Manus handled the execution.

This combo gave me a live-stream-ready brief every morning.

No input required.



# Real-Time AI in Action

What blew me away was watching it work in real time.

The browser tab opened automatically.  
It searched the web.  
It compiled news summaries.  
It saved everything into Drive — live.

And while that was happening, it still had another connector scheduling my stream and another sending the email invite.

Multiple AIs.  
Multiple connectors.  
One system running it all.



# Integrating With Google Calendar and Gmail

Here’s how I set it up:

* Connect Gmail → for sending updates.
* Connect Calendar → for scheduling.
* Connect Drive → for saving outputs.

Then I just said:  
“Create an event today at 4 PM and email me the invite.”

It used Google APIs to create the event, sent the email, and confirmed success.

Minutes later, the invite appeared in my inbox — with all the details included.



# Manus 1.6 AI Agent Isn’t Just a Tool — It’s a System

Once you create your first project, you’ll realize how big this is.

It’s not about one-time tasks.

It’s about building *persistent AI workspaces* that think, act, and repeat automatically.

You can design your own flows once, and they’ll run forever.

That’s leverage — the kind that scales teams and businesses.

# Why Manus 1.6 AI Agent Matters

We’ve hit a turning point in automation.

This isn’t about chatbots anymore.

This is about connected intelligence.

**Manus 1.6 AI Agent** shows what happens when AI stops being a “tool” and starts being a *teammate*.

When your AI can talk to your calendar, email, browser, and design tools — that’s not productivity.

That’s transformation.

I don't care about gender. I prefer people in their 20s/early 30s. SFW only.",4,1766804207.0,Needafriend,5,0.83,False

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like those massive life overhauls are just too much to even *think* about? Like, changing everything overnight sounds exhausting and frankly, a little impossible? I get it. We all have those big dreams, right? The ones where we're suddenly a completely different, optimized version of ourselves.

But here's the thing that's been really clicking for me lately: **it’s the tiny, consistent steps that build the foundation for those massive transformations.** We're talking about the almost invisible shifts that, over time, compound into something truly extraordinary.

Think about it:

*   **Morning Rituals:** Instead of hitting snooze five times, what if you just aimed to get up 15 minutes earlier? Use that extra time for a quick stretch, a few pages of a book, or just a quiet cup of coffee. It’s not a marathon, it’s just a gentle nudge.
*   **Mindful Moments:** Feeling overwhelmed? Instead of letting it spiral, try a 60-second breathing exercise. Just breathe in, breathe out. Simple, yet profoundly effective at resetting your nervous system.
*   **Learning on the Go:** Got a commute? Instead of scrolling endlessly, pop in a podcast on a topic you're curious about. Even 10 minutes of new information can spark ideas and broaden your perspective.
*   **Nutrition Nudges:** Can't overhaul your diet tomorrow? Start with one small win. Add one extra glass of water to your day. Or swap one sugary drink for sparkling water. Baby steps!
*   **Movement Matters:** Not ready for a full gym session? Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Go for a short walk during your lunch break. These little bursts of activity add up.

It’s about building momentum. It’s about proving to yourself, day after day, that you are capable of making positive changes. These aren’t drastic measures; they’re subtle adjustments that, when practiced consistently, lead to profound shifts in how you feel, think, and perform.

Sometimes, though, even these small steps can feel tough, and that's perfectly okay. Life throws curveballs, and navigating emotional challenges is part of the journey. If you're looking for some extra support and guidance on building resilience and working through difficult emotions, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) to be incredibly helpful.

What are some of those tiny habits that have made a big difference in your life? Let's share and inspire each other! ✨",1,1766803966.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1pwmq8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALS/comments/1pwmq8j/ever_since_my_dad_was_diagnosed_with_als_ive_had/,"Ever since my dad was diagnosed with ALS, I've had extreme anxiety and I don't know what to do.","Hi. I'm 15yo and my dad was diagnosed with ALS a few weeks ago. Ever since he's been diagnosed, I've been extremely anxious for not just him but for my mom too.

I'm literally always with my dad. I moved all my stuff into the living room (Where his bed is) to be with him. I feel like if I leave to go to the to toilet once he might get up to go to the toilet and fall, or try to drink coffee and burn himself. Every second I don't see him my nerves spike and I immediately run back to check on him.

Same thing with my mom. I've become extremely protective of her and I can't seem to stop. If I see her chopping something, cooking, or going out to shop, I'm so worried she got into an accident or she might cut/burn herself. When I'm in the car with her and i see her going 1km over the speed limit i beg her to stop. And tbh this is mainly for selfish reasons. Cos i know my dad is gonna die, and he's not the most functional rn (hands are extremely weak, needs assistance to walk). I know if i loose my mom, i'll basically be an orphan.

So yeah i.. really don't know what to say. my anxiety over both my parents is getting worse and worse. Has anyone else gone through something similar or know someone who's gone through something similar to try and maybe calm my nerves? ",6,1766803913.0,ALS,2,1.0,False
1pwmq7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pwmq7d/mf_the_leopard/,[MF] The Leopard,"“Grab the rail,” he advised. She lurched backward as the bus pulled away. “I like to hold my lid like this, see? Keeps it from spilling when the bus brakes.” The freckles on her nose crinkled while she contemplated a snide retort. She grasped the cold metal, shifting her fragile body further from him, closer to the stranger sitting in the single seat along the window.

The thought of bolting at the next stop briefly surfaced and passed. She sipped her coffee instead, gripping the foam cup in her other hand as the bus continued. Perhaps these meetings were working after all, or maybe she just craved the taste of bitterness.

His voice kept going. A buzzing gnat fluttering around her ear while she was trapped in thought – reassuring herself of belonging among the same people she once considered soulless sell-outs. The perfectly styled hair, sprayed down sleepily before sunrise. The quiet, consuming stare into their phones, filling each moment with a constant flow of entertainment. Desperate fingers clacking and swiping, looping through endless cycles, while their tired eyes hastily run along the lengths of the screen. Complete disconnection from reality around them. Sounds familiar.  

She counted each stop, each person who got on or off. The ones who didn’t tap their phone. The ones who stood too close to the exit, triggering the irritating warning. Ten people wore jeans, two people were sleeping. One couple sat silently a few rows ahead, legs pressed together. Two young kids screamed over their parent’s phone, tiny fingers clawing for control.

Without realizing it, she did the math. Old reflex.  

Surely, she could move through this world the way she always had – alert, clever, relying on a charm that carried her through worse places than this, ones with sharper edges and harsher rules. She could learn the rhythm, soften into it, pass for ordinary long enough to call it progress. She had thought that before. The timing changed. But the outcome was always the same.

…

The smell of old metal crept by as she shifted in her chair, awaiting her turn. Her lips parted as she exhaled, weighing who to reveal. 

One by one, each member recited their story. A man with a rasp in his voice described the first warm taste of beer at the ripe age of twelve, breaking into his mother’s stash after she passed out cold on their smoke-stained couch. A woman younger than her played a solo game of thumb-wrestling as she recounted the weekend. A friend’s birthday at a bar – how tragic.

The stench of sweat and stale coffee made her want to leave. 

The circle moved on. 

The chairman’s overzealous gaze landed on her, followed by an obnoxious nod and a quick wave of his stout, hairy hand. 

“My name’s Laura and I’m an addict.”

Here we go.

“I guess I’m here,” she cleared her throat, biting back a pile of self-pity word salad, “‘cause I’m over it.” 

A reverb of mundane, robotic chatter filled the hot church backroom, toward her section of the circle. The group echoed their solemn reply: “Hi Laura.” She crossed one leg over the other, nearly losing her balance on the lopsided folding chair.

She briefly revealed some story of despair – the rehearsed, tamed version that she recited during the more boring meetings. Nothing about the lifetime of brutal abuse she endured from her father or the agonizing abyss inside her from her late concubine. None of the obvious events that would explain why she belonged in these groups. Because any one of those terrible happenings a human could endure would justify her belonging. But this part was familiar.

…

She sat there on an uncomfortable office couch, designed to look overtly modern. The secretary’s tap tap tap of her pen against the glass desk, drilled its dull resonance into her. She couldn't stop herself from lingering over the woman’s appearance, acrylic red lips pouting toward a screen full of pretend work. Two windows overwhelmed with tabs – mainly shopping sites.  
The secretary caught her vacant stare, pausing before returning to her work.

“He’ll see you now, you can let yourself in.” 

She followed the command, shuffling toward the seven-foot burlwood door. She noticed the exit sign on the ceiling toward the end of the room, just beyond a row of identical, stark white cubicles. No personal effects lining the desks, an occasional plastic plant poking out the side of the smoked glass dividers. Her eyes linger on that exit for a moment too long, imagining a runner’s hundred-meter dash, ripping off her ill-fitted blazer loaned from some pity program. 

She blinked and continued toward the door.

A middle-aged man leaned forward in his oversized leather executive chair, perfectly fitted to him. A tall stack of documents rose beside him, the kind that probably grows by the end of each day. Behind him sat two full-grown bird of paradise plants, silhouetted against an obnoxiously clear, floor-to-ceiling view of the city. Sunlight skidded across the tacky decor, landing sharply in her eyes. 

“Please, have a seat.” He gestured toward another uncomfortable chair. 

Through a forced smile, she recited her lines, biting back a taste of resentment. She’s charming, she’s entertaining, she’s lying; she’s always been so good at that. 

He described the requirements of the job, typical phone tasks. Read from the catalogue – never go off script. His prickled goatee wiggled around the phrase. Each plausible scenario deliberately described in a deep navy binder, edges curled from the last warm body. 

She only needed to say a handful of half convincing sentences before he offered the job – this part seemed less familiar.

After a few minutes, they both stood. She barely reached his chest, offering a firm handshake. The type that men like him usually respect. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Lana.”

…

The room smelled again of burnt coffee and disinfectant, this time in the back of a community center. She convinced herself to find it familiar, almost comforting. Maybe if she believed it long enough, it would lead somewhere else – a life with picket fences and a golden retriever. Two energetic kids clung to her legs. The husband came home, pushing open a bright yellow door. Maybe it's the holidays. Crooked mistletoe hung in the kitchen doorway. His hands settled at her waist. Burnt ginger and clove float around them.

Or that's just the smell of the room. 

She took her seat, the folding chair sagged like the depleted body it held. Her eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face, finding only the same blank stare. Dark eyes watching, waiting. 

The meeting began with voices that droned on, muffled to a buzz in the back of her head. The same stale air. The same tragic stories. The same boring meeting. 

An oddly shaped coffee stain marked the carpet. She shifted a little taller in her seat. “My name’s Leah, and I’m an addict.” 

They nodded on cue. 

…

A burning drag from her cigarette met her lungs. Obsessive fingers slam the numbers. Delete. Slam. Delete. The process repeats until she’s smoked it to the filter, stinging the sides of her fingers. 
	
She exhaled a plume from her nostrils as her thumb finally landed on the call button.
	
“Hi mom, it’s me.”
	
A pause lingered in the small apartment, mixing with smoke and incense. The old cracks in the wall mocked in hesitation. The metallic knocking from the radiator bounced into the receiver. 
	
Her mother’s voice sounded calm in a way that felt mistaken. She offered her usual whisper of hope. “I just want you to be okay.” 
	
She impulsively hung up before a goodbye. The line goes dead, leaving the room too quiet to move.

…
	
Life has always been an intricate dance with a fleeting sliver of light. She reaches out her hand, playing with the tiny specks of dust that float through the dark. Slow, gentle movements, careful not to chase them away. They drift through the air, only visible when the light hits just right. Her eyes trace each path, lulling her deeper into an eerie stillness. Entranced by the way things fall apart. 
	
Her thoughts spiraled around the room, eyes darting from one letter to the next, asphyxiating in their lengths. Pressure swelled, pushing outward through her body. 
If she could just get a hold of herself. But there lies a dark heaviness – deep, bleak, and warm. Latching around her body, chasing the light away. Her hands moved before her mind could orchestrate, wrapping the elastic around her arm. A gentle, sharp embrace.

The radiator screams, hissing steam. The pipes clang in argument inside the walls. Wooden shelves creak under their own weight. Floorboards complaining with every shift. The ceiling settles. Light fixtures buzz. The refrigerator clicks. The building breathes, uneven.

Just this once, she whispers her hollow promise.

The sliver of light escapes.

She always knew she’d make it here again.

After all, a leopard never changes her spots.

I currently reuse pods and use different flavoured coffees. 

Well i tried the Magnifica plus and i cant believe how disappointed i was. The coffee tastes burnt and has absolutely no flavour. I tried multiple dial adjustments/strengths and volumes based of dozens of sources and nothing changed the flavour to be any bit better. I used different types of coffees and it tastes flavourless compared to when its made in the Nespresso. 

I cant believe it as i feel like either mine is defective or i have a completely different palate to every other coffee drinker out there. Also what is with the sizes? Why is an XL barely half a cup of coffee the small is like 1/5 cup and my cups are not big at all.

User feedback:
- way less AI than I've been seeing on other big blasts.
- the author tags have improved, it was much easier to scroll and scan and see what the relationship was for each book. Thankful that some MF authors tag their books MF, super helpful.
- Great selection of books including quite a few from 2025. 

Two negative notes:
- stop labeling books CLEAN. 
- ""Like Harry Potter for ladies who like their books spicy!"" Eww! Honestly, it's 2026, there's no one alive who doesn't know what JKR is all about. Hard pass on any author using that to promote their book.

1pwmom6,https://i.redd.it/fgt6ywuqsn9g1.png,I Watched A Movie Nothing Lasts Forever (1984),"Don't be mistaken this isn't a James Bond knockoff movie nor is it the novel that Die Hard was based on ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" 1979.

This is a unreleased bad movie that was suppose to be a love letter to 1930- early 40s movies. Except they forgot to add a coherent plot to it. I don't even know what genre I would put this in. Sci-Fi when half the movie has Sci-Fi elements and the first half has none? Thriller? Comedy but there's barely any jokes? Romance probably.

The movie stars Gremlin star Zach Galligan, going to new york after a random man motivated him to work for his dream of being an artist. He goes to New York but is told he needs to pass an art test to draw a model woman. He fails the art test and is put to work as an overseer in tunnel traffic. Helps some bums on the street and 1 old man foreshadows that he will be famous, then starts dating the model woman from before. Then the old man who got a bread and coffee from Zach, shows him a secret world of people who control mankind and they need his help to bring love to the moon where he will meet his true love. You're indoctrinated into the spirit world, Zachey. The most infamous part then happens when Zach accidentally sneaks on to a wealthy elite Government vacation tour rocket bus to the moon. Then finds his space woman. The movie ends with him being a talented pianist famous on earth and him finding the space woman in the crowd.

After hearing that crazy plot you start to understand why they didn't release it or have an official distribution of it. Which also ended SNL's director Tom Schiller's movie career.

Also Zach the main lead, looks as confused as I was watching this movie.

If you would like to watch this strange forgotten film with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd somehow.:

Personally I hate being confused, I also hate boring bad movies. Joy does not last forever.

1pwmoev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pwmoev/how_to_talk_about_sex_without_shame_the/,How to Talk About Sex Without SHAME: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I grew up thinking sex was one of those things you only talk about after a few drinks, half-joking, half-whispering. Most of us did. Sex ed was awkward and incomplete, and porn filled in the gaps in a very unhelpful way. It’s kind of like learning how to drive by watching action movies.

At some point I realized this wasn’t just a “me” problem. A lot of people are bad at talking about sex because we were literally taught to avoid it. Society treats sex like Voldemort. Don’t say the name. Don’t ask questions. Definitely don’t admit you want something.

The problem is that silence around sex creates way more damage than talking ever does. Mismatched desire. Resentment. Fake orgasms. Relationships that slowly start to feel like roommates who cuddle sometimes.

I spent a long time looking into this because my own communication around intimacy was… not great. Here’s what actually helped.

## Be specific about what you want
Saying “I want more intimacy” doesn’t give your partner anything to work with. It sounds important, but it’s vague.

Instead of:
- “I wish our sex life was better”

Try:
- “I’d like to try having sex in the morning when we both have more energy”
- “It turns me on when you text me during the day that you’re thinking about me”

Specificity removes guesswork. *Come As You Are* by Emily Nagoski helped me understand why this matters. Not everyone experiences desire the same way. Some people need context and buildup instead of spontaneity, and realizing that alone removed a lot of shame.

## Don’t have these talks in the bedroom
Trying to give feedback during sex almost never goes well. Timing matters.

Pick a neutral moment. A walk. Coffee. A random quiet evening.

Start with something you genuinely like before suggesting anything different. And frame it as curiosity or exploration, not criticism. “I want to explore this together” lands very differently than “you’re doing this wrong.”

Listening to *Where Should We Begin* with Esther Perel helped me see how easily these conversations can feel like attacks if you’re not careful with tone.

## Figure out your own shame first
It’s hard to talk openly if you’re already cringing inside.

A lot of sexual shame comes from:
- religious or cultural messages
- gender expectations
- comparing real sex to porn or social media
- past experiences that were uncomfortable or unsafe

Reading *The Body Keeps the Score* made this click for me. Shame isn’t just mental. Your body reacts before your brain does. That’s why talking about sex can feel physically uncomfortable, even when you logically know it’s safe.

I also found it easier to process this stuff through audio instead of reading everything. I bounced between podcasts, summaries, and a few apps. Insight Timer helped with grounding. Blinkist helped with quick overviews. BeFreed was useful when I wanted psychology and relationship topics explained in one place instead of jumping between random sources. What mattered more than the platform was slowing down enough to notice patterns instead of telling myself I was “just overreacting.”

## Ask questions instead of assuming the worst
A lot of sex-related fights are built on assumptions.

“They’re not attracted to me anymore.”  
“They think I’m bad at this.”  
“They don’t care.”

Sometimes the reality is stress, exhaustion, or something completely unrelated.

Try asking:
- “How are you feeling about our sex life lately?”
- “Is there anything you want more of, or less of?”

Curiosity works better than accusations almost every time.

## Accept that awkwardness is normal
Talking about sex *is* awkward at first. That doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.

Laugh when it feels cringe. Start with smaller conversations about touch or affection before jumping into specifics. Every person who’s good at communicating about sex was once bad at it.

Sexplanations on YouTube is a surprisingly helpful resource for this. Dr. Lindsey Doe explains things in a way that feels normal and non-judgy, which makes the topic less intimidating.

## Check in before it becomes a problem
Waiting until you’re frustrated makes the conversation heavier than it needs to be.

Some people do monthly check-ins. Not in a dramatic way. Just a casual, “How are you feeling about our physical connection lately?”

Routine makes it less scary.

*Mating in Captivity* by Esther Perel goes deeper into why long-term relationships struggle with desire and what actually keeps attraction alive. It challenges a lot of common advice, but it’s worth sitting with.

## Remember that consent is ongoing
Consent doesn’t stop once you’re in a relationship.

Checking in during sex, respecting changes of mind, and paying attention to comfort builds safety. And safety almost always leads to better sex.

## Get comfortable with the words
If saying “vulva,” “penis,” or “orgasm” makes you want to disappear, that’s a sign there’s still shame there.

Say the words out loud. Use real terms instead of euphemisms. The more normal the language feels, the less power the shame has.

## Know when to get help
Sometimes this stuff runs too deep to handle alone.

Trauma-informed therapy helps. Couples therapy helps. Online therapy can help if in-person isn’t accessible. There’s no moral failure in getting support for something this personal.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: we live in a culture that’s obsessed with sex and terrified of talking about it honestly. That contradiction isn’t your fault. But staying stuck in it is a choice.

Talking about sex without shame is a skill. It feels awkward at first. It gets easier with practice. And eventually, it just becomes normal.

Your sex life won’t improve from one conversation. But it definitely won’t improve from none.

1pwmljl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1pwmljl/we_paid_our_daughters_bills_and_her_car_of_for/,We paid our daughters bills and her car of for Christmas and it was the best gift we gave.,"She lives at home because she loves being with us. She pays us rent on time, works full time, and is a responsible adult. We are grateful because we have heard nightmares of parents struggling with their adult child still living at home and acting like children. She is in her mid 20s and pays us $400 in rent every 1st on the month. Rent is always in an envelope on the coffee table by 6am on the 1st. Never have to ask for it. No matter how much she works, she always helps out with her baby brother and does her fair share of chores in the house. We never have to ask. She has good friends and makes good choices. 


So we decided to show how grateful we are and pay it back.

We gave her December rent back to her. Got her a new computer. Paid off her car, paid for new tires, and paid for a year of car insurance. Bought hair products,  makeup, clothes, socks, laundry detergent, her favorite snacks she splurges on and put it in a brand new hamper for her. And in her Christmas Card was a Costco *black* membership card.

Our daughter hugged us. Cried. We all cried. We told her how proud we are of the adult she has become and all that lovely dovey parenting stuff.

Our four year old son has us laughing by thinking it is just boring adult stuff. As he said  ""Tires? Why does she need tires? They are already on her car.""  He thinks he got the best Christmas gift because we got him a really big $100 dinosaur toy. We can't wait for him to grow up and repay it to him when he is an adult.",590,1766803545.0,Parenting,39,0.98,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

i dont have a lot of people to talk to about my sobriety. my older sister was a debilitating functional alcoholic for my whole life until she got sober about two years ago. sshe is still having a hard time getting on her feet, and thinks my sobriety is easy because i wasnt as bad off as her and i generally have my shit together. it sucks we cant relate much.

i stopped drinking after a breakup when i was around 30. ive had one partner since then, but in the almost 4 years since i stopped drinking it has been so so hard to find people to date. not because theres no booze, but because the bar culture i used to meet people doesnt exist for me anymore. and yes, i have hobbies and a rich friend group and social life. its just not the same. my standards are higher too, and its about impossible to find someone to date. it makes the holidays feel extremely lonely.

its so hard to not want to drink so i can be ""normal"" and do what everyone else does and get what everyone else seems to get. i know in my heart thats not how it works, but i miss it so much. i miss splitting a bottle of wine with a new love, or having margs on a friday, or baileys and coffee at brunch. it feels like men arent interested in a woman who cant do these things. its just so disappointing. makes me wonder if my life is actually harder in this way because of my choosing to quit drinking, would it be easier if i just did? if i was normal? what am i even doing this for?

I’m Rza, 27. I’m a pretty masculine guy overall. I’ve been doing MMA for about a decade now and i love riding my motorcycle around, even in winter!! but lately I’ve been intentionally trying to get more in touch with my feminine/soft side and expand my world a bit.

Recently I’ve gotten into:

* Painting (still learning, but really enjoying it)
* Making music (making songs in DAWs)
* Reading a lot (I’m big on sci‑fi books/movies)

**What I’m looking for:**  
Strictly platonic friendship with people who have a more feminine vibe/energy (gender doesn’t matter. men, women, non‑binary welcome). If you’re in a relationship, that’s honestly a plus, because I’m not here for dating or anything romantic.

**Hangout ideas I’d love:**  
Coffee and a walk, bookstore/library hangs, a casual “paint at a café” session, swapping music and sci‑fi recs, or a low‑key movie night (public meetup first). I’m also open to group hangs if that feels safer/easier.

If this sounds like your vibe, DM me and tell me:

1. your age + general area, and
2. one thing you’re into lately (and your favorite sci‑fi book/movie if you have one).

No pressure. if we click, awesome. If not, all good. :)

Oh and I prefer downtown Vancouver for hanging out.",0,1766803228.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,0.25,False

I’ve been thinking about whether a small circle like this already exists — or if a few of us might want to shape something lightweight together.

Not a program, not a big group. Just a handful of people (maybe 4–6) who are already building something and want a bit of accountability and company along the way.

What I’m imagining (very open to shaping together):

• Quick weekly async check-in (what you shipped / what’s next)

• Optional virtual co-working

• Maybe the occasional coffee shop or library work session if it makes sense

• No single organizer — we rotate who nudges things along

Probably not a fit if you’re:

• Still at the idea stage

• Looking for a mastermind or pitch group

• Not actively building right now

If this resonates, I’d love to hear:

– What you’re building

– What stage you’re at

– Roughly where you’re based in the East Bay

Not trying to build anything big here — just momentum.",0,1766803111.0,eastbay,0,0.4,False

Had the perfect storm last night: CDiff positive patient with an ileostomy that he refused to empty himself. This also happened to be my first time encountering either of these since I started working independently. 

All precautions were followed religiously, I hand washed my hands to the bone after each time in the room, and I bleach wiped every piece of equipment on me before leaving (even the things otherwise covered with PPE). Stripped at the door and immediately threw everything in the washer while I went directly into a scalding shower. 

I lie down, thinking I’ve done it all right….then I wake up and have diarrhea after my morning coffee 🙃 haven’t had anything since besides from stomach discomfort but I’m chalking that up to too many Christmas leftovers. 

Anyone else gaslight themselves into considering a trip to the ED??

Edit to add: I know how unlikely it is to actually “get” CDiff as a healthy person. This was half-way in jest that this all happened to me all at once and I have the stress shits the next day. ",0,1766803106.0,nursing,13,0.5,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pwme2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1pwme2p/separated_from_starbucks_3_pls_give_me_some_advice/,Separated from Starbucks </3 Pls give me some advice,"I’m not sure who would be interested to read what I have to say but I was separated from Starbucks on Saturday December 20th. My manager mentioned that I would be sent a Separation Package for my sudden departure and I left without causing any problems as I was in a bit of shock and still wanted the opportunity to work at Starbucks again if I decided to give this company another chance. Tomorrow will mark a week since I’ve been separated but I have yet to receive my Separation package despite reaching out to Partner Care and my Manager mentioning that within 48 hours I should receive an email with information about the package and signing the documents. Is this something I should be worried about? I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I would like a few unbiased opinions on what happened.

At first it didn’t hit me right away as I was coming from a bit of a Euphoric high as I had taken 2 days off work to celebrate my birthday. I pulled into work as usual on the 20th and was ready to start my 6 hour shift. Did my coffee tasting and mentally was prepared for a busy day and busy week with the holidays and holiday pay coming. However a few minutes into my shift I was called into the BoH to have a conversation with my manager. He handed me the paper and communicated that I would be separated from the company, effective immediately and would have a few minutes to grab my things.

I had a feeling this would happen as I was on a final but heres a bit of context about the work environment I was in. Every single partner, even SSVs were on finals. We were getting written up left and right for every minor infraction and my Manager had separated 4 of our partners this year. A few of my partners had to transfer as his management style was affecting their finances and mental health.

I was told that I was being separated for violating the Attendance and Punctuality Policy. The exact infraction was accidentally no showing for an hour and a half as I slept in by mistake on November 19th. In the past however these separations were handed a week or so after the violation so I was on edge for a bit and had a conversation with my Manager and was believed to think that it was my final straw. A whole month passes and they so conveniently waited until the day after my birthday and less than a week before Christmas to officially separate me. Was it intentional? I’m not sure. But I do give my manager the benefit of the doubt that he was following orders from our DM as he’s been cracking down on a few things and being more by the book than usual.

Yes I know that this easily could’ve been prevented with proper time management but I personally have gone through many burnouts throughout the year. I was sent to Phantom to other locations in my district, working 9+ days straight sometimes and still not cracking 40 hours some weeks and was promised lots of growth and development that was never implemented.

As for my future I’m not sure what to do from here. Part of me saw this as a blessing in disguise as I was thinking of transferring locations as I had enough of this management style but I’ve basically been blacklisted from the district. My manager mentioned I could be rehired at another district but this separation would be on my record and it would be up to the Manager to decide if they would like the application to even go through. They said that my separation wasn’t anything drastic and it truly is possible to be rehired but I’m not sure if I even would want to work at Starbucks again despite loving my job and loving my fellow partners.

What made me feel worse was having to say goodbye to whoever was on the floor and seeing all their faces changing as I said my final goodbye, even having them personally reach out was just so devastating. I’d like to believe that I was pretty good at my job, being recognized a few times for my hard work and receiving compliments in other stores from people i’ve worked with once or twice. I was fairly known in the District but sadly I could never work there again. I’m also stuck wondering if I could even dispute at LEAST the ban from the district, I’m fine with being let go but I want that to disappear at least.

Sorry if this is super long but if you’ve made it this far I appreciate you for taking the time to listen my story and my experience with Starbucks. Any feedback on this situation and where to go from here would be really appreciated and helpful <3",1,1766802949.0,starbucksbaristas,1,0.6,False

1pwmclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1pwmclf/separated_from_starbucks_3_advice_wanted/,Separated from Starbucks </3 Advice wanted,"I’m not sure who would be interested to read what I have to say but I was separated from Starbucks on Saturday December 20th. My manager mentioned that I would be sent a Separation Package for my sudden departure and I left without causing any problems as I was in a bit of shock and still wanted the opportunity to work at Starbucks again if I decided to give this company another chance. Tomorrow will mark a week since I’ve been separated but I have yet to receive my Separation package despite reaching out to Partner Care and my Manager mentioning that within 48 hours I should receive an email with information about the package and signing the documents. Is this something I should be worried about? I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I would like a few unbiased opinions on what happened.

At first it didn’t hit me right away as I was coming from a bit of a Euphoric high as I had taken 2 days off work to celebrate my birthday. I pulled into work as usual on the 20th and was ready to start my 6 hour shift. Did my coffee tasting and mentally was prepared for a busy day and busy week with the holidays and holiday pay coming. However a few minutes into my shift I was called into the BoH to have a conversation with my manager. He handed me the paper and communicated that I would be separated from the company, effective immediately and would have a few minutes to grab my things.

I had a feeling this would happen as I was on a final but heres a bit of context about the work environment I was in. Every single partner, even SSVs were on finals. We were getting written up left and right for every minor infraction and my Manager had separated 4 of our partners this year. A few of my partners had to transfer as his management style was affecting their finances and mental health.

I was told that I was being separated for violating the Attendance and Punctuality Policy. The exact infraction was accidentally no showing for an hour and a half as I slept in by mistake on November 19th. In the past however these separations were handed a week or so after the violation so I was on edge for a bit and had a conversation with my Manager and was believed to think that it was my final straw. A whole month passes and they so conveniently waited until the day after my birthday and less than a week before Christmas to officially separate me. Was it intentional? I’m not sure. But I do give my manager the benefit of the doubt that he was following orders from our DM as he’s been cracking down on a few things and being more by the book than usual.

1pwm9kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMasterApp/comments/1pwm9kt/want_to_know_meaning_of_life/,want to know meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1766802592.0,GameMasterApp,0,0.33,False
