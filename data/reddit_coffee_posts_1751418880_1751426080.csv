If you have had success after 30-45 days please share your stories!

**Please do not comment with any advice to discourage me, it‚Äôs only a month so I don‚Äôt think this will be damaging. I know it is not sustainable long-term.**

*(BACKSTORY)*

I felt healthiest around 150-160lbs, which is where I was from age 19-23. I went through a lot of lifestyle changes at age 22-23 (moved countries, full time job, doing university classes), but I only noticed myself gaining weight around Oct 2023 after a doctor‚Äôs visit weigh in. I was at that point 180lbs. For some reason, I decided to avoid the issue entirely. I did not want to face the fact that I was getting so heavy again. By Aug 2024 I was 200lbs. I had not weighed this much since I was 16/17 years old. I still continued to avoid the issue. I struggled a LOT with body image issues and self esteem as a teenager, so I think I was probably avoiding it as a coping mechanism.

I really need to make a change. This is so hard for me to accept and follow through with. I will be 25 this August, and I don‚Äôt want to start this phase of life weighing over 200lbs. Especially since everyone always says after 25 it becomes a lot harder to lose weight.

*(5 WEEK KETO CHALLENGE)*

I am starting over this challenge July 1st. First attempt was May 27th, but due to various factors (lack of preparation on busy work days, my boyfriend's birthday, and trying to develop a healthy social life again) I fell off on week 3. I managed to get to 191.8 within the first 16 days, which was good progress to me. I believe if I prepare and stick to a plan, I can achieve good results. It‚Äôs 100% a mental challenge.

My intention is to use this as the starting point, and then follow a more sustainable eating plan at the beginning of July. I‚Äôm going to keep it very simple:

**Lunch**: 300-350g beef with broccoli OR 4 eggs with 4 slices of bacon

**Dinner**: 300-350g chicken OR beef with broccoli

**In between**: Diet sodas and black coffee

**Exercise**: Week 1 won‚Äôt be too active, but I am going to try to hit 10K steps most days, and eventually incorporate weightlifting and moderate/high intensity cardio.

I‚Äôm posting this now to keep myself accountable, but I will come back with updates!

1lplbhw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lplbhw,Himalayan Leather: A Detailed Comparison between Imported and Domestic Varieties,"Today, we will conduct an in-depth comparison between Singaporean imported Himalayan leather and domestic Himalayan leather through pictures, exploring not only the differences between them but also the differences in price. Let's start with the dyeing differences. Imported Himalayan leather has the following characteristics: First, the pores are extremely obvious, the color transition of the coffee part is natural, and the texture is three-dimensional. Due to the high price of imported leather, the selected leather embryos are of excellent quality, so the water dyeing process can be used, and the effect is natural and realistic, with the middle white part being milky white.

In contrast, domestic Himalayan leather mostly uses inferior leather embryos that are leftover after being screened abroad and can only adopt the spraying process. As a result, the middle white part will have a slight bluish tint, and the pores in the coffee part are not so obvious. In addition, there is a difference in hand feel between the two. Domestic leather feels sandy to the touch, the leather quality is relatively loose, and it is extremely prone to wrinkling; while imported leather is relatively firm.

For Herm√®s, Himalayan leather represents the top quality. Therefore, if you want to make related products, I strongly recommend using high-quality imported leather.",1,1751425871.0,RepladiesDesigner,0,1.0,False

Am I just over reacting?,"- Ive been seen my an allergist - I‚Äôm not seeking medical advice - 

I‚Äôve been to the ER several times this past month and saw an ENT, Endocrinologist and my primary physician before being referred to an allergist. I get severe throat and neck swelling when I eat gluten as of a little over a month ago. This allergy  is completely random so they thought it was my thyroid for 3 weeks until I discovered it swells when I eat gluten. 

Long story short, the swelling gets so bad that it‚Äôs hard to swallow and breathe, and feels like I‚Äôm being strangled! And the worst part is - gluten is in SO MANY THING that you would never even think of. My freaking SHAMPOO?? COFFEE SYRUP??? GLUTEN FREE FLOUR? 

So I have been getting exposed every day. And it gets worse and worse, and I am not supposed to take anti-histamines until my testing, but they didn‚Äôt give me an epi pen so I feel like I‚Äôm just a ticking time bomb! I called and asked them for one today and they said she ‚Äúmight‚Äù send one to the pharmacy üòÄ 

This new allergy is just terrible. I get body aches, throat and neck swelling, neck itching sometimes with a rash, and a sore throat after the swelling goes down a bit. 

I have prednisone for the swelling but it doesn‚Äôt really help until hours later, so I have to just suffer with the swelling and strangled feeling. 

I went to the ER and the ENT told me that I was overreacting and was just having a normal allergic reaction while I sounded like I smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day from the swelling. C‚Äômon! They did nothing for me but prescribe me Benadryl and prednisone. But I‚Äôm not allowed to take the Benadryl. Ugh! 

I‚Äôm a nanny so I am terrified that I‚Äôm going to be exposed at work and go into anaphylactic shock and then the baby is just going to be alone and I‚Äôll be d*ad .

Do they only give you epi pens if you test positive? My test isn‚Äôt for another week. 

I guess this is more of a rant than any questions. 
I‚Äôm so scared of eating and drinking and showering and washing my hands and using ANYTHING.

When we then asked for help to find the place we were looking for, he said, ""My son will take you."" In moments, a young boy came out of the shop, beckoned to us, and began quickly running down the street. We jogged after him as we navigated the dense streets of Tangier in the middle of the night. He quickly brought us straight to our hostel and then ran off before we could thank him. 

The next morning, we had not yet converted our Euros into Dirham and were having no luck finding a place to do so. We stopped by a restaurant to ask them if they knew anywhere to do the exchange. Without hesitation, they said, ""You have no money? Sit down, and we will get you something to eat."" They came back with multiple dishes of the most amazing food I've ever eaten. After we finished, they tried to give us free dessert and Dirhams. We couldn't accept the free money and they understood. I promised to come back and pay them when we got our money, and they said there was no need. I will never forget that level of hospitality in even just my first 12 hours there.

*Jacques carter greeted me warmly at his bakery, offering a firm handshake dusted with flour. He apologized for the slight delay, mentioning that the bakery had been understaffed over the break due to VA week. He and a few others with no one else to spend their break with simply stayed at the bakery and had been diligently preparing the dough. Since the official end of the conflict and the reformation of the EU, business in the French capital had been flourishing once more. A veteran of the war, he caught my attention at a general assembly meeting of veterans of the conflict. As he shouts to his brother to take over the preparation of the dough he invites me to sit outside, pouring me a glass of coffee and offering me a cigarette before addressing me with some surprise laced in his voice.*

""I‚Äôm surprised you came to me first of all people. Someone in your line of work, I'd expect them to interview the generals or the heads of states,"" he proclaims as he lights his cigarette and takes a smoke. Several seconds later he puffs out smoke from his mouth as it forms a small smokey ring in the air which I avoid.

""Well you are one of the few who survived the war from start to end and the only one of those people I could currently find so I came to you. You clearly must have some story to tell"" I answer curiously.

The Frenchman shrugs as he takes a long drag and stares at the sky. The sight of a bird flying gracefully sky catches his attention.

‚ÄúHonestly, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for you should ask the birds.‚Äù He says with a smile on his face.

‚ÄúThe birds?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, those guys got out of dodge even before the ministers and the journalists.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you explain further?‚Äù

""Listen, it's not just the fact that I lost half my hearing and knee joints in that damn war. It's like it caused a short circuit in my brain. But one thing I know for sure is that those darn birds saw it coming,"" he remarked, exhaling the last drag of his cigarette. He then continues on somewhat exasperated.

‚ÄúOne day they were there. Then, about half a day before those squid things landed followed by the crabs and reptilians. They got out of dodge before anyone realized what was about to happen. For a whole day the sky was filled with flocks of them moving north, east, west, south, up and down. We knew something was up from that point on.‚Äù

‚ÄúTensions around the world were high?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh? You‚Äôd drop a stack of boxes on the ground a bit too loudly and half the base would be jumping behind anything that seemed solid enough to take cover behind thinking we were getting bombed! Then, there's this guy who decides to light a candle in our chapel, and next thing you know, a part of it catches fire after he left! Before we could even dial up the firefighters, My staff sergeant yelled at me to grab my machine gun, lie down in the hallway, and be ready to fend off the Russians. Picture me, in my sport shorts and football jersey, all geared up with my plate carrier and helmet, tucked away in a dark corner, convinced Spetsnaz were about to storm the hallway in any minute.‚Äù He exclaims before continuing on.

""Russia had invaded Ukraine just a year earlier and then when little old Putin realized he couldn't square up the Ukrainians he began eying up the Baltics. A move that would have been stupid had he not signed a formal alliance with the Chinese and had guaranteed support from them. It seemed at any moment ww3 could break out. The issue was both Nato and the Russo-Chinese pact didn't exactly want to be the ones to throw the first punch.""

""That was in 2023 correct?"" The man then turns his head to my question some what annoyed I had cut him off before sighing and continuing his tangent.

""Yes, but little did we know, the storm hadn't even hit us yet. I remember that evening like it was yesterday. I was holed up in my room, binge-watching The Sopranos on my cursed laptop.  Suddenly, one of my comrades calls me out to the hallway. Late-night briefings were nothing new to us; our platoon commander often briefed us after his meetings with the higher-ups. Our lieutenant, fresh out of the academy at 24, had a name none of us could pronounce.

¬†

As I stepped into the hallway with my notebook and trusty foldable camping chair, I saw it written all over his face. Fear. He was trembling like a leaf. He ordered us to gear up for 72 hours straight. One guy was told to sprint to the ammunition depot and save us a spot in line before the other platoons swarmed in. Everyone was to grab their gear, drivers to bring the vehicles to the parade square, and the rest of us to rush to the armory and ammo depot."" He then pauses for dramatic affect and continues but not before letting out another cigarette puff.

¬†

""In those few seconds of silence, we all exchanged the same incredulous looks. 'Is this for real?' was written on every face."" He then lets out a cough before speaking again as I write down the information on my note pad.

""We were like deer looking at headlights. And then, that kid with two stars on his chest and five years of military academy experience let out his first genuine panicked yell in his entire career. In a flurry, we darted to our rooms, snatching up our gear, stuffing our backpacks with everything we might need. Amidst the rush, I stole a moment to shoot off a quick text message to my girlfriend at the time."" Jacques turns around to stare at his wife in the shop who‚Äôs overlooking the books.

‚ÄúSome crazy bastard once told me that the moment I knew I‚Äôd be getting into combat; that I should understand that I was already dead. That way I‚Äôd be less scared once the moment comes. Trust me, even with that I sat on one ass cheek the entire way to our TAA. My wife never forgave me for that message I sent her.‚Äù

‚ÄúTAA?‚Äù I asked.

""Tactical assembly area, where we gather before the action kicks off. The vehicle I rode in, a CV9035, had been prepped daily for potential encounters with the Russians. We had bought them a year ago from the Swedes. Despite the exhaustive technical checks and training drills, it was still a chaotic mess. The transition to the TAA resembled a Congolese farmer's market more than a meticulously planned military operation by the most formidable alliance in history. Vehicles left with tanks half-empty, ammo boxes vanished into thin air, and we discovered our infantry fighting vehicle had only half the water we needed because someone used our war stock to cook noodles during training. Then there was the German tank that accidentally flattened a parked military police car in route to the TAA. The craziest part? The commander didn't even bat an eye once he realized nobody was hurt; he just pressed on to join the rest of his platoon. Can't blame the driver, though‚Äîwe were all pretty distracted.""

‚ÄúBecause of the meteors?‚Äù I then saw asking the big question. The man nods and waves his hands in the air for an emphasis as he speaks.

""You should've been there to witness it firsthand. The footage doesn't do it justice. It all kicked off as we were scrambling onto our vehicles. Everyone hit the deck, seeking cover. It took a few minutes for us to realize we weren't in immediate danger and emerge from our tanks, basements, drainage pipes. Picture this: central Latvia, practically right under the impacts. Every few seconds, our tank would shudder from the sheer force of the explosions. The noise was deafening. No wonder the few survivors in the area ended up with tinnitus.

¬†Meteors, each weighing hundreds of tons, detonating kilometres above us, shattering as they broke the sound barrier. That's what I call shock and awe. Our first air casualties weren't from our or the Russian air defense firing blindly in the chaos; they were helicopters, fighter jets even two air liners unfortunate enough to be directly under those meteors transporting crabs. A buddy of mine witnessed an NH90 torn apart by the shockwave alone. Even the helicopters and jets that made it back to their airbases had to be grounded due to structural damage it inflicted.

As we left our base I had to see it, so there I was like a kid looking at the night sky. It was dark, but the meteors entering the atmosphere was like a second sun lighting up the surroundings. They exploded and became hundred of different smaller pieces each carrying god knows how many squids in them. In fact some of them I heard had the crabs in them though I don't exactly buy it as from what I heard the crabs came in the 10th wave though who knows what the alien attack plan was. Maybe they were crabs in the opening waves for all I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you and your platoon have any idea what was going on at the time?‚Äù I question.

""Not in the slightest, it was chaos. Radios blaring, everyone trying to make sense of the madness. Our lieutenant had to hotmic the radio at one point to restore some order. Initially, we thought it might be MIRV‚Äôs, Multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles. Nukes that separated into multiple different ballistics ogives that each could target a different city. Seemed like the closest match. But the meteors were not even 1/10 of the speed of those. And if they had really been nukes none of us would be here to tell the story, so we scrapped that theory.

¬†

When we finally reached the TAA, my vehicle commander, a sergeant in his early thirties, stone-faced as ever. You couldn't crack a smile out of him if your life depended on it. Ask him anything personal, and you'd get the driest response before he walked off. Guy smoked like a chimney and could outdrink anyone. He hailed from West Flanders, a real 'boer' as we called them‚Äîonly farmers lived there. Anyhow, he ditched his crew helmet, ordered us to hold tight, and bolted towards our platoon commander's tank. From where we stood, there was just one friendly Estonian battalion between us and the Russian border. Not that it mattered, since we were clueless about those falling squids all around us and landing from Kaliningrad to St Petersburg. 510 million square kilometers on earth and they somehow landed in the most heavily militarized region. And that was just in the first wave in the second wave they began to hit the United states and Mexico and then in the 3rd just a couple days later they landed in western Europe.""

As Jacques took a long drag from his cigarette, his eyes lingered on the scene unfolding in the park before us. His gaze followed the carefree movements of a child chasing a small dog across the lush green grass. The innocence of the moment and the gravity of his memories seemed to weigh heavily on him. In that simple interaction between the child and the dog, there was a fleeting glimpse of normalcy. It was as if, for a brief moment, he found solace in the simplicity of the scene. I gently wait for him to speak giving him the time he needs to compose himself before he once again speaks, this time more heavily.

‚ÄúUNKOWN CONTACT, 3 O‚ÄôCLOCK, 400 METERS.‚Äù ‚ÄúI heard one of the men just several meters away yelled. That scared shit out me, our sergeant had quickly switched his monitor on and looked at what the man several feet away was seeing. After what seemed like an eternity of switching camera modes he grabbed the handheld radio and radioed it in to our lieutenant. As he was trying to describe what he saw the meteors lit up the figures for a second or two. They had stopped moving and seemed to be watching us. He had to coordinate things with the lieutenant on the radio, the dismounted troops outside and with us inside.""

He then paused as he world seemed to slow, offering a momentary reprieve from the chaos of his thoughts. He once again continues

""You know, I still can't figure out who fired the first shot. It definitely wasn't us, and the dismounts on our left weren't the culprits either. I'm pretty sure it was that 1-5 vehicle on our right that kicked things off. Anyway, they let loose a burst, targeting one of them. Then BAM! The third high-explosive shell hit, and its whole body just cracked open like butter. The ones before barely made a dent, but that last one? It was a game-changer. I still get chills thinking about it. Even munching on shrimp brings back that memory like it was yesterday. Afterwards, the whole field lit up. Picture this: a hundred of those guys, armed with their makeshift blasters, around 4 or 5 per tentacle, all aiming in our direction. It was like a scene straight out of a space western. They were also massive. Like if you seen photos you know what I'm taking about. 5 meters tall at max and 2 meters at their shortest.

They weren't exactly the most precise bunch but they made up for it in coordination and overwhelming fire power because they could wield multiple of those things due to their tenacles. Half of them let loose their shots all at once, while the others waited for the first half to reload before firing. Even to this day me and my colleagues who survived think those were the first to land, their shock troops of sort. Precision wasn't their strong suit, but trust me, you didn't want to catch one of those 'geo thermal' blasts. It was like getting hit by a supernova in miniature form. The heat seared through tissue, wood and dirt like butter, leaving nothing but scorched earth in its wake. You could practically feel the ground tremble with each blast. A few shots hit our vehicle. Thanks to the armor we survived. They couldn‚Äôt take us out with those blasters as long as we where in the vehicle. Still it made me shit myself. I didn‚Äôt even know who I was fighting but I started blasting. But the dismounts outside were less fortunate. Some fitness freak right in front of our vehicle. She caught one in the thorax and she was split in two. And that was just a ricochet. The driver described to me how her upper half was jolted into the air.

I picked a target, fired a burst of HE shells. They were tough. Shrapnel from the HE shells didn‚Äôt kill them outright. I realized quickly I had to get a direct shot. As I blasted that cannon, I saw those sneaky crabs pop out of the field ahead, wielding their weird weapons. So, I adjusted my aim real quick, targeting the closest critter. When I let loose that first shot, it tore through the air, smashing those squids like they were made of glass."" He once again pauses as he gets a bearing on this thoughts.

""If you want to stop-""

""Its ok don't worry I'm fine"" He mutters before speaking again.

""When we envisioned aliens arriving on our planets we imagined them coming with shiny silver space ships. Those guys seemed like they used recycled materials for everything. It‚Äôs why allot of people believe this confederation of Aliens if you want to call it that, came from a distant collapsing planet, or that they had lost their home world to war and now were trying to settle here. Before I could even think on how I was going to take it down one of them they brought in their armor. It was this massive Tripod looking thing not to dissimilar to that from war of the worlds. The difference was it was made out of pure flesh. Its sides had these mouths snapping about and long tongues that dripped down and tried to grab at any infantry outside of their vehicles. The central and largest of the mouths had the ability to fire some kind of explosive projectile. There was a scream on the radio, someone inside was describing the flesh Tripod before screaming as the heat blast boiled them inside before the ammunition cooked of and sent the turret flying ten meters in the air. I blasted it with all I got. HE, APHE, APFSD. The HE seemed to shake it. But the armor piercing rounds did the trick. Despite it being made of flesh it was thick skinned if one wanted to saw. It was 15 meters tall and a terrifying site to behold.

When I say those thing were resilient I mean it. They traveled god knows how many galaxies or solar systems on meteors and somehow survived the landing and they came in waves. I was blasting it as I saw its mouth heat up. My sergeant, god bless him popped the smokes. We had smoke cannisters on our vehicle pointed at every angle. He saw it heat up and order our driver to drive forward five meters as the phosphorous smoke cannisters flew and exploded in the air. As we pushed through the smoke¬†I started unloading again. As I saw the cannon heat up, some brave bastard fired a rocket at it. I believe it was a Spike. A tv guided anti tank rocket that can pierce pretty much anything human made. It tried to stand tall for a few seconds again before falling in the mud. After that we high tailed it deeper into Estonia. We were one of the lucky ones. Entire battalions got encircled by accident that day or simply ran headlong into them while on patrol or maneuvers that night and in the morning.

Throughout the rest of the night and morning of the next day we bore witness to the carnage we managed to avoid just narrowly if you want to call it that. Their were no ""Front lines"" at this point and squid and our guys were simply running into each other. It was a strange game of cat and mouse were both the cat and the mouse accidently moved around without knowing what was going on until they came face to face with each other. As we drove along the quiet road, the only sounds were the hum of our engines and the gunfire and explosion in the distance. We drove by four destroyed M109 artillery vehicles and half a dozen utility trucks. All blown to bits and still burning. Some with its crew still smoldering in and outside of the vehicles. It‚Äôs hard to understate how critical the position the crabs landed in was.

In modern, peer to peer conflict. Your enemy doesn‚Äôt magically appear behind, above, left and right of you. You don‚Äôt have enemies parachuting in your back yard all of a sudden, that shit only happens in Hollywood movies. Had they landed on the Russian side, we might have had a fighting chance that week. I was on the turret, peeking out with that sergeant I told you about on the side. At first I thought it was a firefly because of the way it flew in the air. It peacefully glided in the air from ground with a weird flight path. That why I thought it was an insect at first. Until I realized it was at a distance and was coming straight for us. I barely had time to yell ‚ÄúGet inside!‚Äù that it exploded in the air into multiple fragments. It hit our convoy. My right hand was still holding the hatch handle and was exposed outside. The burn I still feel from time to time. I am lucky to still have control of the arm. I am even more lucky I managed to get the hatch closed. Second degree burns, I wept and felt like I was about to pass out from the pain. All while we fought our way out of that ambush. Thank god that ordnance didn‚Äôt take out our engine. I wept all the way to the border. Took me a few weeks to get my hand in order.""

I (27M) have had a rough week. I'm going to break this down day by day because I'm struggling and don't know what else to do at this point.

Thursday night- I played a few songs at open mic night, hopped on stage later with a few musicians and did some improvised stuff. Came home and watched a movie.

Friday- went great up until about 6pm. I was getting ready for game night at my friend's house. I was trying to straighten out my glasses and broke them by accident. I start driving to my friends house and I'm laughing about everything, past the point of anger and tears. My relaxed, loopy state continues at game night. It was all going fine until I had 4 beers and excused myself to go get some air. I went onto my friends porch and started sobbing. Friend comes out and we spend roughly 2hrs talking. It helped but something felt really off when I got home.

Saturday- shitshow at work, got yelled at for something that wasn't my fault. I went into Walmart optical after work because the website said they had walk in vision exams but was informed once I arrived that there were no openings for 2 weeks. 

I politely wish them a nice day and leave the store. As I'm driving home, the rage takes over. On the outside, I'm driving safely and normal but inside the car I'm screaming about how sick I am of living, how fucked up the world is, how I want to kms, etc. 

I get home and start using my arm as a cutting board, actively trying to unalive myself. It was at this point that I should have gone to the hospital but I don't have health insurance so that was out of the question. My dad called me and he wasn't very helpful so I said some shitty stuff and blocked him. I called into work for the next day. Later in the night, when I told friend from later what was happening, he came over and sat with me until 2am. Went to sleep feeling stable.

Sunday- I woke up around 10am, felt like dogshit so I went back to sleep. Woke up again around noon and went downtown. I got a coffee and walked 11 blocks straight both ways just absolutely miserable, feeling nothing and everything at the same time. Drove home and worked on some music, took a nap until 6pm. Woke up at 6, had a productive convo with dad, went to the store and then went to bed. Had another self harm episode because I couldn't sleep.

Monday- went back to work and felt terrible for the first few hours but slowly got better. Came home and slept until 7pm.

Today- went to work had a great day but once I got home the depression came back. I slept until 7pm, just got back from the store but on my way home from the store, some jackass in an oversized SUV honked at me for yielding to oncoming traffic. I keep driving, screaming at myself again, hitting myself. Home now, have to be up at 5:30 for work but since I slept until 7 I'm not going to sleep until midnight at the latest.

As a woman, I often think maybe it's too forward to connect with guys I see around me. I'm worried about things being misinterpreted; that maybe I have ulterior motives or want something else when really I'm just looking for friends.

I'm currently in Seattle WA studying computer science, but often have trouble approaching people to connect with them. 

**Does anyone else have this problem?**



I'm interested in building a *social tool* to help connect with people at the coffee shops I go to. I've partnered with some of my friends to explore the idea, but I wanted to check with others to see if it's something you'd be interested in using.  
[**Here is my proposal that explains the social tool.**](https://studio--third-space-connector.us-central1.hosted.app/) **Please let me know your thoughts!**

  
The basic premises of the social tool are:

1. People behave better when there are mutual friends involved. We'll use AI ethically to moderate and drive connections; treating AI as a mutual friend to be on ""out best behavior"".
2. I'm not looking for a ""perfect match,"" I'm looking for community. I want to meet people at the places I already spend time at: church, coffee shops, stores, etc. A sharper focus on geo-matching.
3. People want to be matched on their deepest emotional needs that can't be found from a simple form or checkbox. We'll use AI ethically to try and understand who you are, what you need, and what another person is available to give you based on our understanding of them.",0,1751424622.0,SeattleWA,2,0.43,False

6/17/25: **I‚Äôm feeling off today. I think it might be from not spending that much time with her today. She was offered a shift to substitute at an elementary school about half an hour from our home.**

**I‚Äôve been feeling off the whole day. I should‚Äôve kissed her goodbye. I say that since I‚Äôm not sure if I did give her a kiss.**

**I have work later in the day, which can suck. But she‚Äôs coming home after I leave for work, now that sucks.**

**So I figured it would be a good idea to do something Pre-Her. Pre-Her being my life before 2/14/25. It feels like a lifetime ago. I feel like life didn‚Äôt begin until now. Speaking of her, she was right about one of the reasons I was journaling because I was pretty lonely.**

**I‚Äôm temporarily lonely so.**

I woke up at 4:15 in the morning on 6/6/25. I‚Äôm glad that the first alarm woke me up, I‚Äôm sure that the next five would‚Äôve woken me up anyway. 

I could‚Äôve showered the night before, but I figured it would be better if I showered now. It would help me wake up faster, if it didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why coffee exists.

I made sure to put a couple in the fridge ahead of time. I was only going to drink one of them, the rest for my brother who was dropping me off at MSP. He was gonna do it for me for free, so I figure that I would get him a little something in return. Especially since he had work later at 7. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôs already up around this time anyway. He‚Äôs got a fucked sleeping schedule. There‚Äôs been times where he‚Äôd sleep for 12 hours during high school, so I can‚Äôt imagine the naps he must be having now.

I packed light. It‚Äôs not like I was going to be staying at Los Angeles for the night. If anything, I was going to be staying at that Sun Country flight for the night with my girlfriend. I‚Äôm flying to Los Angeles so I could fly with her to Minneapolis. I figured that‚Äôs nothing compared to what she‚Äôs doing by moving to Minneapolis. It‚Äôs a lot on her. I wanted to make it easy as possible for the transition. Why? Because I love her.

I brought my Switch 2 with me, I bought it the morning before on its release. I was going to wait in line until morning, but it‚Äôs for the best that I didn‚Äôt because I would‚Äôve had zero sleep for this trip. I got the bundle with Mario Kart in it. I probably could‚Äôve waited to make this purchase.

My brother got to my house a few minutes early, of course, I was still rushing to get ready. I wasn‚Äôt too worried about getting to the airport quick though. TSA Pre-check is going to make up for it. I realized my brother was willing to take me when he sent me on a mission to pick up cupcakes from LAX.

Yes, he wanted cupcakes from the airport. I assumed it was for his girlfriend. His girlfriend that I didn‚Äôt know much of at the time. He does go through lengths for his partners. He sent me on another mission while I was in Japan to get an exclusive plushie. Just for that relationship to wind up in the bucket sometime later.

We said our goodbyes and I said my thanks. I busted my ass through TSA, I‚Äôm happy that I didn‚Äôt end up getting groped this time. If I had placed the hand sanitizer in my bag instead of my pocket, I wouldn‚Äôt have been groped though. 

I played some Mario Kart 8 as I waited for my flight to be ready. I would‚Äôve played the new Mario kart but my stupid ass forgot to set my switch up properly. I also kinda regret bringing it since I had kids and babies around me. 

Now, I don‚Äôt hate babies. But being around babies in an airplane is something else! They‚Äôre like a ticking time bomb, but without the jihadist. It also doesn‚Äôt help how uncomfortable planes in general can be for me. The flight to Minneapolis from LAX was definitely easier since my girlfriend was there next to me. Well‚Ä¶ the extra roomy seats we paid for did help. I might have to actually do that more in the future.

I mainly did word searches throughout the flight and listened to LA music. I made it to LA at around 6 AM PST. It was nice to be back! Even though, I wasn‚Äôt really in LA, just in LAX. 

The problem is that my girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt be there until 2 pm-ish. Why? She was at work while I was there. I decided that I‚Äôll begin the side mission that my brother sent me on. I thought I was losing my mind since the fucking map from LAX was wrong. The fucking cupcake machine wasn‚Äôt in terminal 2! 

So I had to go across the airport to the international terminals just so I could get my brother some cupcakes. I wish I found the chipotle before I had this overpriced burrito that was the size of an iPhone 6. Like that burrito was so small that it barely managed to fill me up. I didn‚Äôt really mind though since   
an angel was going to bring me some in-n-out and jack in a box. That angel being my girlfriend.

I mainly chilled after getting those cupcakes since I was dying of boredom. It also didn‚Äôt help that my phone was dying. Had to sit my ass on the ground to charge my phone. Like I could‚Äôve walked back to the terminal I was in so I could charge it sitting down. But I couldn‚Äôt bother at all. I just wanted to sit my ass down.

I was pretty happy upon hearing from my girlfriend that she was on her way to me. I did also feel bad since she was practically rushing to get here after her shift. She was also rushing to get me some In-N-Out and Jack In A Box. It had been two years since I last had some of those tiny tacos from Jacks, and I‚Äôve been craving them for two years. And now those cravings are being fulfilled. It really meant a lot to me that she was going out of her way to not only hook me up with that, but that she is moving to Minneapolis with me.  

It didn‚Äôt take that long, but it felt long to me since I was awaiting this moment since April. The moment that I would see her again in-person. We had a pretty big hug like it felt so right when we embraced one another, it felt like something out of a movie. But this is real.

She had mentioned beforehand that she didn‚Äôt want for us to have PDA in front of her mom, which is fair. I‚Äôd just have to kiss her some other time. 

We then sat down once we caught up. (My ass was starting to hurt at this point for how much it‚Äôs been sitting down) But I didn‚Äôt care about my ass getting sore because my love had brought me a double double, animal style fries, and tiny tacos. We were about to FEAST. I savored every single damn bite out of that meal. I didn‚Äôt care if I was making a mess on myself or if I was eating too quickly or if I looked like Gollum. I felt bad cause I wanted to kiss my girlfriend, but I don‚Äôt think she would‚Äôve appreciated me smearing ketchup or mustard on her. 

After our Lunch, we had a mission. We had to rearrange her luggage to make sure that she didn‚Äôt put too much weight on them. The airport fees can be a bitch. But honestly, it was difficult trying to rearrange everything throughout all our luggage. I should‚Äôve brought a bigger suitcase or duffel bag. Like it got to the point where we were debating if we should just pay the fee. We made it work though. 

And once we made it work, they sent our asses out of the line‚Ä¶ They said that we couldn‚Äôt check in early into our flight. But that had me fucked up since we had spoken to another attendant beforehand who said that it was okay.. My girlfriend soon received a phone call from the airline that we could check in early, which is fucking great because we could now have some actual seating instead of the hard ass ground.

We just have to go through security first. My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt have a passport or have a Real ID, so I was worried when I had to separate from her in line. I wasn‚Äôt able to find her anywhere when she was behind me, TSA was screaming for people to go through the line. The X-Ray was the easy part. Im grateful that I didn‚Äôt get felt up. But holy shit, did it stress me out. I fucked up by not taking my girlfriends laptop out of her bag. So TSA pulled me out of line to inspect through the bag. Am I fucking happy that I no longer carry that knife in my keychain. TSA would‚Äôve made my day an actual shitshow. 

I was also able to find my girlfriend, that got me to calm down. I don‚Äôt like going through TSA. I don‚Äôt appreciate how they make my blood pressure spike up. I‚Äôm just happy that we had that shit over with. Got through the hard part, now we could just relax before the flight. We pretty much chilled for that time. I had already done a lot of walking, so I was cool with taking it slow. 

Like it was really busy when we first got there in the waiting area, but once everyone left, it was really calming how empty it was. There was an amazing view where you could see planes take off. It‚Äôs an even better view when you don‚Äôt have to hear them being loud as fuck, so we appreciated that. We even cuddled for a bit. 

We still had hours to go before the plane got here. I probably should‚Äôve taken a nap, I think my girlfriend actually had a nap now that I think about it. 

**I‚Äôm actually pretty upset at myself for not making journaling more of a habit since my girlfriend moved here. It would‚Äôve been lovely to have a little recording of our first days together, but I suppose that‚Äôs why we have each other to remember in our old age. Also she isn‚Äôt really my girlfriend as of writing this now. Well, she‚Äôs my fiance now! I thought about having it be a surprise when I wrote about proposing to her. I proposed to her in bed, I do think I‚Äôd like to throw a more ‚Äúformal‚Äù proposal later in New York since I do feel kinda bad. A lot of change happened quick, but of course that‚Äôs expected with a major change, I did write some ramblings of our days though.**

The flight back to Minneapolis was nicee. I‚Äôm happy that we got those extended legroom seats. I don‚Äôt usually go for that, but I understand why people put the money towards it. It‚Äôs just much more relaxing‚Ä¶ the seats felt more comfortable. It was my girlfriends (now finace‚Äôs) idea. We held our hands a lot, I really missed doing that. 

We didn‚Äôt have much trouble heading to MSP.  It was an overnight flight so we managed to get a few hours of sleep. Shit still left me sleepy after that. I don‚Äôt know how people can manage to get a full rest with a plane that can shake you awake. 

My mom was already on her way there to pick us up. It did take awhile for the luggage to arrive. I was hoping that the employees didn‚Äôt fuck up my girlfriends luggage up. I was worried that it‚Äôll explode and we‚Äôd have to frantically put her stuff back in there. I get flashbacks of what happened to me returning from LA a couple years ago. My suitcase slid out of the heavy luggage area with shit spilling out of it. Had a fucking anime figurine poking out of it.

Luckily, she didn‚Äôt pack any figurines so her suitcase didn‚Äôt explode. It‚Äôs actually the same suitcase I used for that trip. And when I mean she, I don‚Äôt mean the figurine. 

My mom picked us up. She was pretty happy to see us. I think she really likes my partner because of how much happier I‚Äôve been now due to her. We talked about the flight, the plans my partner and I have, and about visiting my mom soon sometime. (Soon already happened by the time of writing this. Shit. Coming soon had already happened by the time of writing this)

It was nice arriving at this time (6AM), the sun was still coming up. I felt like this day had a lot of ‚Äúmovie moments‚Äù. We went up to our bedroom. It‚Äôs nice no longer calling it my bedroom. We then held each other once more and drifted to sleep. Our lives begin now.

1lpks6f,https://i.redd.it/03lu1pqejdaf1.jpeg,MRE diet,"After seeing the previous attempt from XanzMakeHerDance unfortunately end early, I decided to take up the gauntlet and eat one MRE a day. After I‚Äôve tried every item from both menus I will contemplate continuing. Currently on day 4, will post the 4th review after I‚Äôve consumed it. My previous experience has been with Canadian IMPs and I will often contrast and compare as such. 

The first US MRE I tried was the chili Mac, and honestly it was overhyped a good bit. Came with orange drink, twizzlers, vegetable crackers (super good), jalape√±o cheese spread, and probably something else but I forget. Overall, felt like it was less food than a Canadian IMP, but it was good. The mini bottle of tobasco was cool, and I did not get one in the next two MREs. No coffee In this one. 

Second MRE was the Italian sausage, which was quite delicious. The snacks however were lack luster. Inside was trail mix with cranberries, almonds and beef jerky, peanuts, and dried cranberries. All of these were good on their own but when eaten together it was just one big trail mix and I would‚Äôve liked to see some variation. This one came with lemon sports drink I believe, 
which was not terrible. No coffee. Regular crackers are way worse than vegetable crackers, same with the plain cheese vs jalape√±o. 

Pepperoni pizza was my favourite of the three, purely because you can make an apple crumble with the dessert. Crushing the oatmeal cookie and adding it to the apple slices in sauce, along with the creamer and sugar pack turns it into an amazing dessert. This one did come with coffee. I was expecting the pizza to be worse, but actually reminded me of pizza I used to have for lunch as a kid. The chocolate shake was mid, the powder refused to mix nicely. I wish it came with peanut butter instead of cheese spread so I could add it to the shake (might use personal peanut butter in the future). The shake was very filling, and I comfortably was able to finish my day. 

Overall, pretty pleased with the MREs but none of them had sporks (spoons instead) and only one came with hot sauce. In Canadian IMPs all of them come with a sports drink and coffee, as well as a packet of franks hot sauce. The Lunch rat has 2 drinks which I don‚Äôt expect to see here. Disappointing to see this isn‚Äôt the same. The packaging in US MREs is very robust compared to Canadian MREs using a paper bag and still encasing most items in cardboard, requiring more field stripping when packing them. There‚Äôs other minor differences, like IMPs have tic tacs but I prefer the cinnamon gum in the MREs. Canadian IMPs do not come with the heater inside and must be sourced separately which is a nice change. 

For day 3, bowel movements are regular and energy levels are normal. I am also working out in conjunction with this and might start doing ruck marches to fit the vibe. Occasional supplementary Rip its or other energy drinks may be added on some days.  ",1,1751424219.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

I have terminal stage 4 breast cancer and some liver problems, and I am also obese. I started keto mainly for weight loss, liver repair, and to help fight my cancer because I‚Äôve heard from many people and research that it helps fight cancer.

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

Thank you all in advance for your help and kindness.",6,1751424133.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

I am wonering when/how it is best to get furniture, as it is July 4th soon and will be around labor day when we move. The main things we need:

* couch
* TV
* dining table
* coffee table
* chairs
* bed stands
* dressers
* kitchen equipment
* cleaning supplies
* vacuum

I plan on getting a cat a couple months after moving as well, so any recs on furniture like couches they wont scratch as much or any considerations would be rgeatly appreciated!

I am bringing some stuff with me like a bed, bed frame, and a desk, and some other smaller things.

Main thing I would like to know is when (best time for deals) and where (IKEA, wayfair, fb marketplace) would be the best place to shop for stuff like this to get the most bang for buck? I am splitting costs with my gf as well.

I am also planning on renting a uhaul to move stuff from my house now (living with parents) and idk if its easier to order the bigger stuff here before moving and then bringing it along with the uhaul rather than order it to the apartment (it is garden style and we are on the 2nd floor)?",1,1751424005.0,ApartmentHacks,0,1.0,False
1lpkpck,https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/1lpkpck/our_sign_chats_brought_us_even_closer_than_i/,"Our ""Sign Chats"" Brought Us Even Closer Than I Expected","few hours  ago, I shared how learning ASL completely changed my relationship with my grandfather. We started having weekly ""sign chats"" over coffee, and for the first time, I truly got to know him.

Well, I just wanted to share a small moment that really stuck with me.

Last Sunday, during one of our chats, I asked him:
‚ÄúDid you ever feel angry that no one in the family tried to learn ASL before?‚Äù

He paused. Then he smiled gently and signed:
‚ÄúNot angry. Just lonely. I always hoped someone would try.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget that.

That moment reminded me why this journey matters so much. ASL didn‚Äôt just give us a way to communicate it gave him something he waited a lifetime for: to be seen and understood.

So if you're learning ASL and feel like you're slow or struggling, please don‚Äôt give up. You have no idea how much it might mean to someone you love.

1lpkp6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1lpkp6z/im_50f_still_angry_about_a_fight_with_my_husband/,I‚Äôm (50F) still angry about a fight with my husband (52M) because it‚Äôs the same topic that keeps coming up. How do we get to a different outcome?,"I work 3 days a week but long shifts (12hr) so on my two work week days off I do shopping and cook for the days I‚Äôm not around at dinner. I also manage all the family finances (making sure bills are paid etc), organize everything for the kid‚Äôs‚Äô activities and needs (sports, doctor‚Äôs appointments etc). While my husband and family will ‚Äòhelp‚Äô, it is not unless I specifically ask. Garbage overflowing? No one sees it until I ask someone to take it outside. Collection of dishes in their rooms? They were just about to take them downstairs to the kitchen. Cat puked on the white tile floor while I was at work and is now dried to the floor like cement? Oh they didn‚Äôt see it. 

Yesterday was a ‚Äòday off‚Äô so my schedule is packed with things I need to get done along with an appointment (not sitting sipping mai tai‚Äôs or whatever the kids think I do). I do all the cooking (the topic isn‚Äôt whether I should be, I‚Äôm fine with that part) and the kids wanted tacos so I was checking supplies we would need. The kids prefer soft tortillas (which I never eat) so I keep both the small taco size and larger wrap size in the fridge. I was pretty sure I had lots but when I took out the bags, both had been put back unsealed so they were all dried out and useless, about 20 wraps in total. They come in ziplock type bags which are a bit flimsy so I checked both bags for tears and that the zippers worked. The bags were fine.

I take them out of the fridge and toss them on the counter, and ask my husband and daughter (son was asleep) what the plan for dinner will be now? I don‚Äôt eat these things, and since I do all the cooking hubby does all the putting away of leftovers. Hubby says he doesn‚Äôt eat them either. Daughter says nothing. I ask again- who will fix this now? I‚Äôm not only mad that food was wasted but the expectation will be that I fix it. So I said I am not fixing it, and not fixing anything or doing anything for anyone for the next week. And I left. 

Got back late morning to grab lunch before my afternoon appointment and wanted to talk to husband. He works from home and I started to tell him that I‚Äôm so frustrated because I don‚Äôt expect accolades for the things I do, I just don‚Äôt want people adding to my responsibilities and my mental work load because I literally have all the mental load. And when I ask him to do something (like book a day to get the car‚Äôs oil changed since he works from home and the car sits in the driveway if he doesn‚Äôt need it, so makes sense for him to book a time when he can pop it over) he will often ‚Äòforget‚Äô until I remind him. So I still carry the mental load. 

I start having this same old conversation when he says he understands I am mad but is too busy to talk right then. I said fine, but I‚Äôm not doing anything anymore until he tells me what a solution will be so this doesn‚Äôt happen again. Work day for him ends and the dogs want to be fed. He is ignoring them jumping around until I say ‚Äòsorry dogs I guess you aren‚Äôt getting fed today‚Äô. Hubby asks why not. I told him that me doing nothing means just that- nothing. He didn‚Äôt have time to talk before so I will continue to do nothing until we do. And I walk away and spend the rest of the night in our bedroom. I had some leftover Halloween chocolate in my room so ate that for dinner.

At one point he comes in the room and sits at his work desk. I ask if he needs to do more work tonight because I‚Äôll go if he does. He says no, just needs his phone charger. He takes it and goes. Three hours later I turn off the light and go to sleep.

I‚Äôm typing this as I sit in my car at 7:25am. I need to be at work for 8am. Got here at 6:30am because I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Hubby hasn‚Äôt tried to call or text. I won‚Äôt be home until after 8pm. I‚Äôm always the one who starts the conversation again after we fight, but not this time. So since there is coffee inside I‚Äôll go in now and maybe come up with an idea for tonight but would love some suggestions. Thanks!",2,1751423970.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False
1lpkocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lpkocy/my_29ffianc√©_25m_has_been_excessively_fighting/,My (29F)fianc√© (25M) has been excessively fighting with me pregnant and it‚Äôs making me feel like it was a mistake.,"The title says it for the most part. I found out I was pregnant 6 weeks ago. I was in shock, as it was unexpected. I already have two children and have been separated from their father for 5 years. My new fianc√© and I talk often about kids and we both wanted another one but agreed that in 1-2 years we‚Äôd begin trying to grow our family. It happened sooner than we thought and overall were feeling happy about it. I was very nervous due to just getting accepted into Stanford to complete my degree (and it‚Äôs my dream) but I decided to take a gap year, focus on the pregnancy and enjoy it as much as possible before sending myself off to school next fall. 
Recently all we do is fight. Over minor issues, and I mean minor. Yet somehow they blow up from 0-100 within a matter of 30 minutes and we‚Äôre screaming at each other until I start having a mental breakdown and crying. I‚Äôve tried explaining multiple times that I‚Äôm having a hard time handling my emotions while being pregnant. Im sick every day, have crippling exhaustion, and just don‚Äôt feel like myself. It‚Äôs been hard to say the least considering I was an avid gym lover and active mom. It‚Äôs getting to the point that we are just both extremely defensive and angry. It‚Äôs making me feel resentful, especially because it‚Äôs such a vulnerable time for my emotional state as my body goes through these changes. I‚Äôll tell him I need space or that I can‚Äôt talk, but that makes it worse and things always escalate to us screaming at each other. It‚Äôs now gotten to the point that he just tells me how awful I am and how I‚Äôm not doing enough. How I don‚Äôt give him enough reassurance, how I‚Äôm not there for him, how he feels alone, that he doesn‚Äôt know how he ended up with a woman like me, that we can just figure things out with the baby. Let me also tell you that I‚Äôm have also said these same hurtful things. At this point it feels like verbal warfare and I feel lost. Prior to pregnancy I‚Äôve always been the level headed one, and try to stay emotionally sound. Since becoming pregnant, I just feel like dogshit and am constantly crying and feel so depressed. I try my best to be there for him but can‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm nauseous all day long and have no energy. I just lay in bed and cry. I hate how that‚Äôs taken as im not loving anymore and that I don‚Äôt do enough. We‚Äôve tried having calm conversations multiple times. They usually end pretty well, but things go right back to normal. The other day we were fighting because he got to my house and texted me that he arrived but my phone was in my bag and I had taken the kids to get a muffin from a coffee shop at the corner. I left him waiting for 15 mins until I had arrived back home and he stormed inside and gave me the silent treatment, then told me he was going to the gym without me (we had planned on going together) this made me angry and I asked why he was acting that way. I had only just run a quick errand with the children. That fight blew up to an extreme and we ended up fighting for literally the next 12hours.
I feel emotionally defeated. Depleted, mentally exhausted, depressed, alone, and fearful of the kind of environment im going to bring my child into, or even how he‚Äôll be treating me the rest of pregnancy or postpartum. I don‚Äôt have family where we live, as I moved across the country at 18. I just want to know if I‚Äôm being irrational for thinking that parting ways is for the better.  Please no harsh comments. I‚Äôd love some sound advice or suggestions on how to be better. How can I be better? How can I fix this? I know I‚Äôm not the easiest to deal with being emotional and pregnant. But I‚Äôm also feeling so lost and alone. I love him with my whole heart but feel like I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I‚Äôm leaving many more explosive arguments out of this post due to it being so long, but just know that 99% of the time, they‚Äôre over something that I personally

#‚Å¢ Basic Inquiry: Cost-Effective ArtfulExplorations‚Äå materials

ArtfulExplorations,a term we'll use to encompass ‚Å§creative endeavors driven by exploration,experimentation,and‚Äç personal expression‚Äå rather than strict adherence to customary techniques or expensive supplies,thrive on ingenuity and resourcefulness. The beauty of this approach lies in its accessibility: ‚Å§a limited budget shouldn't be a barrier to artistic expression. Instead,constrained resources can foster creativity and innovation,pushing artists to‚Å£ find‚Å¢ new uses for everyday objects and to re-evaluate what truly constitutes ‚Äúart supplies.‚Äù This ‚Å¢article delves into the realm of cost-effective materials for ArtfulExplorations, providing practical guidance‚Äå and insights to help individuals‚Äå and educators alike cultivate‚Äç creativity without breaking the bank. We will explore readily available resources, affordable‚Å£ substitutions, and techniques for maximizing the value of budget-friendly options.

**The Importance of Cost-Effectiveness in ArtfulExplorations**

Exploring artistic mediums ‚Å¢and developing individual artistic styles can be a challenging journey, especially when financial constraints loom large. by embracing cost-effective ‚Å§materials, individuals can liberate themselves from‚Å£ the pressure of expensive supplies and focus fully on the creative process. This allows for more experimentation, risk-taking, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of their own artistic potential. Moreover, cost-effectiveness‚Äç promotes sustainability by encouraging the reuse of materials and ‚Å§reducing ‚Äçwaste, aligning artistic endeavors with environmentally conscious practices. For educators,utilizing inexpensive ‚Äãmaterials makes art accessible to a wider range‚Å¢ of students,nonetheless of their socioeconomic background,fostering inclusivity and equal opportunity‚Äå in creative learning.

**Foundational Drawing and Sketching Materials on a ‚ÄåBudget**

Drawing and sketching form the ‚Äçbackbone of many artistic practices, ‚Å£and fortunately, quality results can be achieved without‚Å§ emptying your wallet. A simple graphite pencil set,‚Å§ ranging from‚Å£ hard (H) to soft (B) grades, provides‚Äå a versatile foundation for sketching,‚Äå shading, and creating detailed drawings. Avoid overly expensive brands; student-grade pencils often perform admirably.

A crucial companion to pencils is the ‚Äçright paper.Instead of investing in premium drawing paper for initial explorations, consider using inexpensive sketchbooks or even repurposed paper, such as office paper that has only been printed on ‚Å§one side. Newsprint is another remarkably inexpensive drawing surface ideal for swift sketches, gesture drawings, and practicing techniques. Remember that the purpose of these initial forays is experimentation and skill-building, not necessarily the creation of finished masterpieces.Erasers are also essential.‚Äå A ‚Å§kneaded eraser ‚Äåis ‚Äãa versatile‚Äç tool for lifting graphite and creating subtle variations in tone, while a ‚Äãsimple pink rubber eraser provides a more ‚Äãassertive erasing capability. A‚Äã plastic‚Äå eraser ‚Äçcan ‚Äåalso be very useful.

**Paint Alternatives: Exploring Affordable Options**

while professional-grade paints can be costly,several affordable alternatives offer ample opportunities for artistic expression. tempera paints, also known‚Å§ as poster paints, are a budget-friendly option ‚Å§ideal for beginners and large-scale projects. They provide‚Å¢ good coverage and are easy ‚Äåto clean ‚Äãup with water. Although their colors may not be as vibrant or permanent as acrylics, they offer excellent value for experimentation and learning color mixing‚Äå techniques.

Another surprisingly ‚Å§versatile and cost-effective option is watercolor paint. Start with a student-grade watercolor set, wich typically includes a range of colors in pan or tube form.Watercolor techniques can be‚Äã mastered through patient practice‚Äã and experimentation, leading to gorgeous and expressive results. Watercolor paper, though slightly more expensive than sketch paper, is essential for ‚Äåpreventing warping and allowing ‚Å£the paint to flow smoothly.

For a more durable and permanent option, consider acrylic paints. While professional-grade acrylics can be pricey,student-grade versions offer a good balance ‚Å£of quality and affordability. Acrylics are incredibly versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces, including canvas, ‚Å£paper, wood,‚Äç and even fabric.

Homemade‚Å§ paints offer another highly cost-effective and experimental‚Äã avenue. Natural pigments‚Äã can be derived from ‚Äåsources such as berries, spices, soils, and even coffee grounds. while the results ‚Å§may be less predictable and permanent than commercially produced paints, the process of creating and using homemade pigments can be a rewarding and educational experience, fostering a deeper connection to‚Äã the materials and the surroundings.

**Sculpting and 3D Art on a Shoe String**

Sculpting and three-dimensional art forms don't have to be expensive to explore. One of the most readily available and cost-effective materials for sculpting‚Äã is paper mache. Made from simple ingredients like flour, water, and newspaper, paper mache allows for the creation of lightweight and‚Å§ surprisingly durable sculptures. The process is also incredibly accessible and can be enjoyed by people of all‚Äç ages‚Äã and skill levels.

Another readily available material is clay. Air-dry‚Å£ clay is an affordable and mess-free option for beginners. It requires no firing and hardens on its own, making‚Å§ it‚Å¢ convenient‚Äå for creating small sculptures and prototypes. While it may not be ‚Äåas durable as fired clay, it‚Äå provides a great introduction to the basics of sculpting and‚Äå form ‚Äçmanipulation.

Recycled materials offer‚Å¢ a wealth of‚Å§ possibilities for sculptural ‚Å£exploration. Cardboard boxes, plastic bottles, bottle caps, and other‚Äç discarded items can be transformed into imaginative and thought-provoking‚Å£ sculptures. This approach not only reduces waste but also encourages creativity and‚Å£ resourcefulness, challenging artists to see the potential in everyday objects.

**Alternative Surfaces: Thinking Outside ‚Äãthe Canvas**

While stretched canvases can be a significant ‚Äåexpense,there are numerous affordable alternatives that offer ‚Äãunique textures and visual appeal. ‚ÄçCardboard, for example, provides a‚Å¢ sturdy and readily available surface ‚Äåfor painting and mixed ‚Äåmedia projects. It can be primed with gesso to create a smooth surface or left unprimed for ‚Äåa ‚Å§more textured and raw aesthetic.Wood panels, available at most hardware stores, offer ‚Å¢another durable and affordable option. Plywood‚Å§ or even reclaimed wood can be cut to size and sanded to‚Å£ create a smooth surface for painting. Alternatively,the natural texture‚Äã of the wood can be incorporated into the artwork for added visual interest.

Fabric scraps, such as old clothing or bedsheets, can be stretched over a frame or adhered to a ‚Å£surface to create a unique and textured painting surface. This approach allows for experimentation ‚Å§with different textures and patterns, adding depth and dimension to‚Äç the artwork.

**Finding Free and‚Äå Discounted Art Supplies**

Beyond material choices,access can be increased by knowing where to look for accessible or discounted supplies. Thrift stores and‚Å¢ flea markets are often treasure troves of discarded art supplies,offering‚Äã paints,brushes,canvases,and‚Å£ other materials at significantly reduced prices. ‚Å§Online marketplaces and community groups‚Å£ are also great places to find deals on used or unwanted art supplies.

Building relationships with local businesses can also be beneficial. Many businesses discard materials that can be repurposed for art, such as cardboard boxes, ‚Å£scrap paper, and fabric remnants. By simply asking, artists can often gain access to a steady supply of free ‚Äãor low-cost materials.

**Conclusion: Embracing Constraints and Fostering creativity**

Cost-effective materials‚Å£ for ArtfulExplorations are not simply about saving ‚Äçmoney; they are about fostering creativity, resourcefulness, and sustainability.By embracing ‚Å£the‚Äã limitations of a budget, ‚Äåartists can unlock new possibilities, experiment with unconventional materials, and develop a deeper recognition for the artistic process. Ultimately, the most crucial ingredient for‚Å§ successful ArtfulExplorations is not expensive supplies, but rather a curious mind, a willingness to experiment, and a passion for creative expression. By‚Å¢ focusing on these core values,individuals and educators alike can cultivate a thriving artistic community that‚Å£ is accessible,inclusive,and environmentally conscious.financial constraints should not be artistic limitations, but rather creative‚Äç catalysts, proving that true art ‚Äãcan be created with minimal resources.

1lpkle7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lpkle7/my_time_in_apartment_6a_inside_the_complex/,My Time in Apartment 6A: Inside The Complex,"Recently, I‚Äôve been talking with a buddy of mine about chronicling my life over the past couple of years, and he said I should definitely give it a go. With the approval of Mr. Rags, I'm going to do just that. I'm not the greatest of writers and I'm sure that sentiment will be reflected here over the course of my stories, so please bear with me. As long as I don't divulge our precise location, I'm in the clear. A big thank you to Mr. Rags, if he ever does read these. Anyways, I should start with a little background to get you up to speed.



I grew up like a lot of lower-middle class families. My dad was a carpenter for a few different companies, bouncing around to wherever the work went, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom, though she made some money on the side selling fresh breads and baked goods. The house always smelled like confectionaries, to the detriment of my slow metabolism. At 18, following High School, I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and joined a trade school while working as a runner for a construction company. They had a 'jack of all trades' kind of track that I selected, giving me a little bit of knowledge in most home repair services, along with basic handyman business acumen. Unfortunately while I was away, my parents both passed. It was a tragic highway accident, heavy rain and low visibility, so it wasn't anyone's fault. After the funeral, it took a couple months to get their affairs in order and sell the family home. I'm an only child, and I couldn't imagine living in the house without them, so I decided to take the profits and move out west, something my dad and I had talked and dreamed about on plenty of occasions. It's weird, but if they had never passed, I wouldn't be here now at The Complex. I also wouldn‚Äôt have been abducted and implanted and‚Ä¶ well we‚Äôll get to that soon.



I had a used Subaru that was older than me by 10 years. It was usually fit as a fiddle so buying a new one seemed asinine at the time. Looking back, I feel like a bit of an idiot, though that‚Äôs almost a daily occurrence now. I'd taken it on a few road trips with nary an issue, but this time was different. I was making my way West starting in Maine, traveling through the Appalachia's over to the great corn seas of the Mid-West, down to Texas and then up heading towards Colorado. I'd made it to New Mexico and was driving for about an hour or two when the engine started to make a horrendous noise. It sounded like something akin to a shotgun blast followed by two pieces of sheet metal rubbing ferociously against each other in the fiery throes of passion. The car shuddered, lurching forward in stop-and-go patterns until finally came to a end, dead in its tracks. I was at least 2 or 3 hours from anywhere remotely populated, or so I thought, and of course I had no cell signal in the slightest. Took some time and tried looking at the engine but it never was my forte, so it ended up being a fruitless endeavor. I resigned myself to sitting in the front seat, all the doors open with the flashers on, sweating my ass off. While I was weighing my options, I leaned the seat back and decided to doze off, an attempt to cure a headache brewing over the frustration of my situation.



Upon waking up, I realized the hairs all over my body were standing like pins and it felt like I was on the verge of having a panic attack. My heartbeat pounded and it felt like a lead weight sat in my stomach, beads of sweat now covering my forehead. It was darker now, much darker, the inky black of night only barely giving way to pinhole stars in the sky. I scrambled up in my seat and tried taking in my surroundings. Something was watching me, I could feel it. I checked all the mirrors and looked out every window. Glancing around frantically, something in the rear view caught my eye for a split second. Next to a couple of tall cactuses about 50 feet from my car, stood something short and white-ish, completely still, staring right back at me. It tilted it‚Äôs head slightly, almost quizzically. I pressed my brakes to try and make the rear lights flare up, but they weren‚Äôt working. I turned in my seat to check it out through the back window, when I caught a flash of it darting towards a large rock pile right next to my car. I think I screamed, hurrying to shut the doors and windows. I rag dolled myself through the interior of my car to get everything closed without going outside. 



I completed my task, sweating and nearly hyperventilating, and for a moment, the feeling of safety slowly crept back. I went to check the cars clock but nothing was working. I tried turning the key, honking the horn, turning on the radio, but nothing worked. I checked my phone for any signs of life. 11PM flashed back at me. I was sleeping for... at least 12 hours. I thought, ""There's no way. I would've woken up before then, I would've needed to drink or eat or..."" my thoughts stopped in their tracks. As I was sitting there, reeling at how I could've lost hours of the day like they were nothing, the car began to vibrate. At first it was slow, almost rhythmic, but quickly became a fast buzzing feeling, like a giant bee was sitting on top of it. I got ready to hop out of the car, but before I could, there was a flash of white light, brighter than the sun. Technically it's still the last thing I remember from that night still, but there‚Äôs a reason for that.



I woke up some hours later to a pair of headlights coming towards me from down the road. I spun my head around again and saw nothing by the rock or the cactuses, but quickly realized through sudden movements that my head was pounding and my entire body felt like I had ran a marathon. My thoughts of the entire debacle were happily replaced by the sounds of a white T-top Trans Am barreling towards me. It passed me in the car for a moment, then stopped, tires screeching on the pavement leaving long black rubber lines. He revved the engine, put it in reverse, shining bright red taillights into the night, and tore ass right back to where I was sitting, rolling down the window as he shouted.



""Hey buddy! You're lookin a little worse for wear! You like, stranded out here or something? Ain't too safe along the roads here at night."" he said in a valley boy type of accent.



I looked around at the vast nothingness before looking back to him and sarcastically answering, though with an abundance of caution in my voice. ""Yeah I‚Äôm alone out here.. I think. Hey you're real right? Did you just see that huge flash? Like the sun just exploded here on Earth?""



""Uhh no, no I can't say I saw that tonight man, but I do know what you're talking about. You feeling okay? Skin doesn't feel too hot, you're not throwing up your bloody guts?"" he asked.



""I... no? I don't think so. I feel fine other than my head. I think I hit it or something, I don't know. I've been stranded out here for hours. Do you know how far the next city is?""



He laughed, and offered me a ride into town, saying it's only a short drive up the way.



""What town?"" I said. ""There's nothing on my map here, and my planned route doesn't have another place with people for a couple hours.""



""Oh man, no need to worry about that. No worries! Maps don't always show ya the big picture you know? I'll get you right as rain my man. Actually, I know just the guy to get you feeling straight shooting again A.S.A.P! Just hop on in and I'll take you to see the big man himself, the big man on campus. I'm sure he'll like you, cause I already kind of like you!"" he chortled and patted the poorly aged passenger seat.



I laughed nervously, bending down a bit to get a better look at the guy and his ride. He seemed nice enough and gave the aura of a guy plucked right out of 1984, neon sunglasses and all. I looked back at my car and took a deep breath.



""Hey dude, once we get back to The Complex, I can totally get a mechanic to come grab your ride. I promise, not a soul out here is going to touch it. Pinky promise!""



Against everything my brain was telling me, I grabbed my duffel bag and other belongings, threw them in the back seat of his hot rod, and strapped myself in. He gave me a huge grin and extended a paw my way. ""Heck yeah man! Names Ray, and yours?""



""Uh yeah, I'm Zach, nice to meet you man. I really appreciate your help, not sure what I would've done if you hadn't stopped.""



""Not a problem at all dude, I believe a good deed done is a good deed in the bank, so maybe I'll score something big next time at the swap meet!"" he laughed as he pushed in a cassette and turned up the volume. We tore off towards his town blaring 'All Night Long' by Lionel Richie. I took a deep breath and stared out the window, wondering how the hell the night was going to end up.



It only took about 20 minutes to reach the edge of town, though I'm not sure you could really call it a town. As we pulled into the gas station (Rays office/sleeping arrangements/full time job) I realized there were only 5 buildings. The gas station, lit up like a cheap motel on the strip in Vegas, a small mom and pop looking store with a few parking spots out front, an even smaller windowless thing with one door, which turned out to be a maintenance building/den or horrors. Then there was the church about 100 yards from it, and directly across from the church was the main attraction. Standing tall was a 10 story tower resembling something more like a large government building than an apartment complex. It was an all tan brick facade with plenty of windows wrapping around it, a couple of pillars out front with the entrance steps, but nothing else. It looked very out of place in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Ray threw his car in park and hopped out in one swift motion, gesturing for me to follow. I couldn't believe my luck that a total stranger actually picked me up and didn't take me to some far off shack to harvest my organs. By the time I got out, he was already halfway to the large buildings entrance. The lights out front illuminated most of the road, to which the neon lights of the ""The Station"" made up for the rest. The Church had a modest set of lights by the front door, but they were easily drowned out by the others.



""Hey man! You coming or what? I think we can still catch Mr. Rags if he's awake! Let's go!"" I started towards him, still a little weary of the situation but I didn't have much of a choice. Once I caught up to him, we were both standing at the entrance to the building. ""Alright man, this here is called The Complex. Mr. Rags owns and runs it. Yes that's his name, and no I don't know if that's his actual god given one. He's really chill as long as you don't mess around too bad. I mean like really mess around, hurt someone or something ya know? Just be real cool with him, and I bet he'll help you out, no sweat!""



Before I could reply, he reached over to click the large button labeled ""10"" on the intercom system. The whole thing looked lavish, emblazoned with bronze numbers and filigree around the edges, clearly sticking out against the drab tan bricks around it. Ray just stood there, bobbing his head to some tune I'm sure was stuck in his brain, quietly humming along. He reached out to ring it again, but just before his finger hit the button, a voice came through the intercom.



""Yes Ray, how may I help you this evening?"" The voice sounded kind and older, with a slight British accent. I figured someone would be irate being called at this time of night.



""Yeah! Hello there Mr. Rags sir, I'm real sorry to bother you tonight, but I found a friend in need here. I think he saw the you-know-whats and is pretty out of sorts. Could you maybe take a look at him real quick? He can crash at my place after, not a worry there sir!"" Ray said, looking nervous but excited.



""Oh is that so? Well, I can't in good conscience turn someone away like that now could I Ray? You know what they say, a good deed done is a..."" Ray chimed in with him to finish the sentiment. ""A good deed in the bank! Yeah Mr. Rags exactly, that's exactly what I say. I knew you'd be able to help! I'll send him on up if that's okay?""



""Absolutely dear boy, just send him up. I'll be waiting."" The mic cut off as Ray nudged me forward.



""Alright man, best behavior. Just in the front doors here, straight back to the elevator and click the only button for floor 10. That's where Mr. Rags lives, right up on top. I promise, he's a real cool guy even if he's a little creepy. Just have him check you out then I'll be waiting over at the station for ya!""



I thanked him, Ray reaching out for a fist bump before trotting down the stairs towards his place. I looked back at the double doors, hesitant to enter. I inched towards them, and as I did, they unlocked through what sounded like a series of electronic deadbolts. The doors opened silently, perfectly in sync, revealing a spacious interior adorned with vintage chairs and pots full of luscious greenery. I walked past it all, peeking around at the other doors. One side looked like it contained a large dining room and kitchen, the other housing a laundry room or utility area. Making my way through to the elevator, I realized the entire area smelled like fresh cut flowers, though there were none in sight. The elevator doors opened with a 'ding' as they moved, beckoning me inside. I got in, found the number 10, and pressed it. The doors hissed this time, closing like they were a part of a pneumatic system, sealing me inside as if I were fresh meat being packaged in an airtight container. It dinged one more time before lurching upward towards my destination.



The elevator seemed to only take 2 or 3 seconds to reach the top of the entire building. The doors hissed again, opening to a very dark corridor. I called out, ""Mr. Rags? Sir?"" to no response. The elevator shuddered, then chimed something more akin to an alarm beep than a pleasant ding, urging me to disembark. Stepping inside the corridor, there were a few wall lights that turned on, though only enough for a dim glow to ooze over the few things inside the room. A velvet waiting chair and matching loveseat, a few very old but still lovely end tables and a larger matching coffee table, and an ancient looking piano on the other side to even everything out. At the end of the room stood a large maroon door, adorned with brass or bronze inlays all across it, yet with no discernible shape. I swear, as I drew closer to the door, the inlays were moving, or squirming into different designs. Taking a few shallow breaths, I pressed my knuckles into the door, three times. As soon as my skin touched it for the third time, the door slowly opened without a sound.



Inside, it looked like any other apartment setup, albeit with a large open concept. A nice dining room set like a retro diner, a few stylish newer couches around a larger old radio, a kitchen set from the 1970‚Äôs; every thing a different age of creation from the last. I took a few steps in and closed the door behind me. I turned my head for maybe 2 or 3 seconds to do so, but when I looked back into the room, Mr. Rags was sitting on the edge of the sofa seat.



‚ÄúOh Jesus, sorry sir. The door just opened when I knocked and I figured maybe..‚Äù he held a hand up to stop me. Not just ask me to stop, but somehow he made me stop talking, like it all got caught in my throat.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright, I wasn‚Äôt waiting long.‚Äù He spoke, almost jovially, a soft smile on his face. ‚ÄúApologies for the scare, I just like to keep an eye on the door. She can be finicky at times, picky even on who she lets in, never mind whether I want them to or not.‚Äù He looked over at the opposite couch, nodding for me to join him.



‚ÄúFor us to continue this conversation, I need you to extend to me a great amount of trust. I know it seems silly, dangerous even, to do so for someone you‚Äôve only just met, but it‚Äôs of dire importance. You need to answer me entirely truthfully. Did you happen upon a creature in the desert? Possibly lose time or see a bright light?‚Äù he leaned towards me, almost floating on the couches edge.



‚ÄúUh, yeah exactly that. My car broke down completely, I fell asleep and woke up to something just watching me. The car began shaking and there was a flash of light and then‚Ä¶ nothing. I can‚Äôt remember a single thing besides Ray showing up and bringing me here. How in the hell would you know about this? I‚Äôm starting to get nervous.‚Äù



Mr. Rags nodded thoughtfully, staring at me a few moments, before slowly standing up and walking over to me. I recoiled slightly, my fight-or-flight kicking in. He stopped briefly in front of me.



‚ÄúAgain, I know this is an immense amount of trust to put in a stranger, but I need to fix you up, so to speak. If I‚Äôm unwelcome to do so, you may experience more of these events, and eventually you may not be around at all. I‚Äôm afraid I would also need you to leave our town in the event this doesn‚Äôt work, or you decide to forgo it entirely. I‚Äôll give you a moment to think about it while I get things ready.‚Äù he walked past me, down the hall into another room.



I watched and listened as he entered what looked to be a bathroom, things clanging as cupboards opened and closed. My heart was racing and my mind was clouded by a million thought streams, every one slightly worse than the last. Am I going to be murdered? Is he getting ready to take my kidney and throw me on ice? I was only 22 years old, I felt like there was much, much more in front of me I wanted to accomplish and experience. Before I could gather myself, Mr. Rags came waltzing out of the door, gliding down the hall towards me.



Standing up from the couch, I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat exactly are you going to do to me? I swear, I won't call the cops, I won‚Äôt tell anyone you‚Äôre here if you just let me go.‚Äù



He chuckled, then stared me dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúDear boy, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to call if you tried. Your phone is dead and the nearest working one is across the street in the shop. You have no idea where you are and no working vehicle. I don‚Äôt say these things to scare you, but to implore you to see reason. I shall not bring you harm, in fact, it‚Äôs to be quite the opposite. You have something inside you that needs to be removed. Something that, if left unabated, will cause you much more turmoil in the future. Your head must feel like a storm is raging inside it, yes?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Is this about the things in the desert?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI feel like a bus hit me. Whatever you need to do, just please, don‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù



‚ÄúI would never. Please, look forward.‚Äù



I felt a small pain on the back of my neck. I craned my head back to find Mr. Rags smiling down at me, a scalpel in his hand.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck? Did you just?‚Äù I felt the back of my neck with my hand, a small smear of blood covered my fingers as I did.



‚ÄúI do profusely apologize, but yes, the ‚Äòoperation‚Äô was a success.‚Äù he air quoted with his hands, ginning sheepishly. ‚ÄúHere, a bandaid for the small incision, and this.‚Äù he raised a small glass vial, dumping in an even smaller grey piece of metal. ‚ÄúI know, I know, you have many questions. In due time, I will answer all of them. For now, you need to get some rest while I deal with this.‚Äù he gestured to the vial. I felt sick, covering my mouth to try and hold back the upheaval from my insides. Mr. Rags rushed around the couch, helping me lay down on one of the ornate pillows. He nodded at me before walking off, as I fell into a deep sleep.



The next morning I woke up at Rays place, a half inflated blow-up mattress and musty smelling pillow keeping me afloat, and an old sleeping bag wrapped around me. The headache was gone and the wound on my neck was already healing, as was my fatigue and my appetite. It felt like I hadn‚Äôt eaten or drank in days. I leapt out of bed, ravenous for anything to shove down my gullet. Luck had it that Ray already thought ahead. He burst through the door to the guest room, fresh crispy bacon and eggs in tow. He threw it down on an old TV tray that was set up nearby.



‚ÄúOh man! You‚Äôre awake! I knew Mr. Rags was gonna get you all set, I knew it. Here, you‚Äôve gotta be starving yeah? We got some eggs and bacon, some toast and OJ man. Well, it‚Äôs not real OJ, it‚Äôs Sunny D but, you get it. I‚Äôm so stoked it all worked out. How was he? All ominous and stuff? That‚Äôs usually like him, but he‚Äôs really nice man. You get the thing out? You‚Äôll be sporting a cool little scar like this I bet! he said, gesturing to the back of his neck. Sure enough, there was a small scar, not more than an inch in size, exactly where Mr. Rags had cut me last night.



‚ÄúYeah man, it‚Äôs happened to a lot of us here. Depends on how you get here I think, but I know I‚Äôve got one, the Watersons and McDaniels have them, Dr. Rheem has it, they‚Äôre all over. But, we‚Äôre all good now thanks to Mr. Rags!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the hell happened? This is like something out of a book Ray, and it‚Äôs starting to freak me out. Can I use your phone when we're done?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúAh jeez, I mean yeah I would totally let you use mine, if I had one. Just no need out here, there‚Äôs no service you know? There‚Äôs phones in The Complex though, I‚Äôm sure you could use one there! Eat up though man, stuffs gettin‚Äô cold and I know you‚Äôre hungry!‚Äù



He was right, I was incredibly hungry and I couldn‚Äôt stay away from the smell anymore. I think I finished the meal in 3 minutes flat, polishing it off and finishing it with a nice cold glass of Sunny D, just like when I was a kid. I talked with Ray a bit more, helped him clean up the dishes and headed to The Complex.



‚ÄúHey man, just don‚Äôt do anything that would get Mr. Rags all angry okay? He‚Äôs a good guy, and the folks around here are real nice too. Just don‚Äôt want you gettin hurt is all!‚Äù he said with a dismissing wave as I walked down the street.



Walking towards it, I noticed that Mr. Rags was already outside, sitting on the steps of the Complex, talking to two suited men. He glanced my way, nodding in my direction, alerting the men in suits that I was headed that way. They seemed to exchange a few more words, then headed off in the opposite direction. They walked down the road in unison, steadfast and unwavering. As I made it to the steps, they were still walking towards‚Ä¶ nothing. Just down the road, left foot after the right. I turned to Mr. Rags who was looking at me with a slight smile.



‚ÄúGood to see you Zach, I trust you slept well? I know Rays arrangements may have not been the best but you were safe there. He‚Äôs a good guy, if a little‚Ä¶ simple,‚Äù he laughed.



‚ÄúYeah thanks, Ray‚Äôs been a life saver. What was that all about though? Those guys there, they‚Äôre just walking away now. Like.. there‚Äôs no discernible reason they should be walking that way. This is all getting way too weird for me. Is there any way I could just get a ride back to my car or.. into the next town? I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, I just feel like I‚Äôm going crazy.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure I could arrange that, but your car isn‚Äôt in any shape to be driven, and the mechanic won‚Äôt be back this way for about a week. The next town doesn‚Äôt have any motels or hotels, and they‚Äôve not quite fond of visitors, so I‚Äôve heard. I have a proposition for you though. We‚Äôve recently lost our maintenance man, Jerry. Poor soul got caught up in one of the storms that pass by here every once in a while. I believe you have the same capabilities he possessed, correct?‚Äù he glanced up at me, an eyebrow raised.



‚ÄúY.. Yeah. I can probably do those kind of things. How did y..‚Äù he cut me off with a raised hand.



‚ÄúExcellent, excellent! Here‚Äôs my thought. I‚Äôll have the old chaps apartment cleaned up and renovated, post haste. It shouldn't take me but a day or two, and there won‚Äôt be a trace left of his existence. In the meantime, you can stay with Ray, possibly have him show you the ropes around here and get you acquainted with a few of our other residents. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll want to have you for one of his ‚Äòlegendary pizza parties‚Äô or whatever he calls them. While you stay here, you could look into a few mechanical disturbances we‚Äôve been having since Jerry‚Äôs departure, as a means of paying it forward. Does this seem like a mutually beneficial arrangement Zach?‚Äù



I mulled it over a moment. He was right, I wasn‚Äôt going to be getting anywhere fast in my car, as broken down as it was, and for all of the weird shit that‚Äôd happened to me in the past 24 hours, I was oddly intrigued by the entire event, if you can call it that. I still had so many questions I wanted answered, and it‚Äôs not like I had a real plans for my near future. Technically, I had made it out West. This could be a fresh start of sorts.



‚ÄúOf course, if you happen to appreciate your new abode, I‚Äôd be happy to hire you on staff, full-time, benefits and all. You could carve out yourself a new life here, a fresh start of sorts, yes?‚Äù I looked at him puzzled, like he had just read my mind.



‚ÄúYeah, alright Mr. Rags. I‚Äôll take you up on that offer. As long as the mechanic can be here within the week, I‚Äôll stick around and help out. It‚Äôs the least I could do really. I appreciate it, sir.‚Äù



‚ÄúSplendid, splendid! If you‚Äôd like, you can wash up in Jerry‚Äôs bathroom, apartment 6A. He was a clean man so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs spotless,‚Äù he said, holding up a brass key, 6A etched onto the surface. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you tonight in the Complex dining hall for dinner tonight, 6:30 PM sharp. I believe the Stevensons are cooking up something special!‚Äù he licked his lips at the idea.



‚ÄúOkay, thank you Mr. Rags. Could we possibly talk this evening after dinner?‚Äù



‚ÄúAbsolutely, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got quite the list of questions for me, and I‚Äôll do my best to answer them all. Have a good afternoon Zach, and welcome to The Complex.‚Äù He turned away and walked inside, the doors opening on their own accord to admit him.



So that was it. That‚Äôs how I made my way into the weirdest towns I‚Äôve ever been in. Officially, this town has no name. You won‚Äôt find it on any map that you can find, and you‚Äôre not likely to pass through it just driving down the road. I‚Äôm glad I decided to stay that day, it‚Äôs made for a plethora of insane, unbelievable and out of this world stories. Until next time, I‚Äôll tell you how a bit of the day went after accepting the offer. As Mr. Rags made his way inside, I followed him. We both rode in the elevator in silence, him clicking the buttons for our respective floors. The doors opened to the 6th floor, two side of the building each an apartment, 6A and 6B. He gestured to the door with a smile and I got off.



I walked over to it, hands shaking a bit as I went to unlock it. I got the key into the deadbolt, when the elevator dinged. I looked over as the doors opened to see an infant standing there. When I say infant, I mean something that looked maybe 3 or 4 months old, far too young to be standing. It was there, bow legged and looking confused, wobbling a bit as it looked around, its head bobbing a bit back and forth like it was too heavy. I muttered something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat the fuck?‚Äù in it‚Äôs direction. As soon as I did, it locked eyes with me, opening it‚Äôs mouth, almost unhinging it at the jaw sockets. The sound that came out of it‚Äôs bowels can only be described as a low, guttural rumble, like an alligator mating call. I nearly shit my pants, turning the deadbolt and door handle to get myself inside as fast as possible. The door popped open and I threw myself inside, kicking the door closed from the floor. I rushed up to my feet and relocked it. Heavily breathing and practically seeing stars, I waited for something to happen. As I backed away from the door, I heard the elevator ding again, the mayhem and low rumbles of the infant waning, as silence eventually took its place.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I plan on fasting at least once a week for 24 hours and I hope to work up to longer fasts if I can figure out how to get this right.

1lpkjpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kefir/comments/1lpkjpn/my_recent_ferment_went_bad/,My recent ferment went bad?,Okay so I've been doing kefir for about a month now maybe a little over a month. I have been doing it with a double coffee filter with the open part of the Mason jar screwed on top of it for air. It's been coming out pretty thick and the last batch smelled exactly like sour cream and tasted like sour cream and had the consistency of sour cream. This most recent jar that I did I put a lid on it airtight. It's very thin and it smells like sour milk and not the good kind of sour milk. It smells like the milk has turned. Is this normal when you put an airtight lid instead of the filter on it? Because I'm scared to drink it and I'm thinking I should probably strain my grains and rinse them with fresh milk and just do it with the coffee filters like I have been. Also we recently got an air conditioner in the kitchen so the apartment is a lot cooler than it was. Could that also be the reason why it smells like sour milk this time? I'm kind of new to this so I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing I'm just going by what the pamphlet said for me to do. Thanks in advance for the help.,1,1751423495.0,Kefir,0,1.0,False

Ugh so long story short. Canyon group started making robes again. I was stoked. For Black Friday they had a 35% off deal. So I jumped at it and bought the infamous heart robe. They promised a 6 week turn around as the robes were made o order. After a hot minute they apologized and said the volume was higher than they projected and offered me $100 off. Which I came here to share and some poor soul took me up on it; I‚Äôm sorry it that was you. I meant well. Well it‚Äôs been 214 days since I‚Äôve ordered and I‚Äôve yet to get a robe. We‚Äôve emailed. They made excuses and apologies. But no change. As of 2-3 weeks ago we were promised it would come out in the next batch. I‚Äôve seen one person say they ordered their robe after me and receive it but still super late. I‚Äôm absolutely done. I‚Äôm a small business owner myself so I tried to be patient but this is just beyond. Do not order from this company. Just go to eBay. At least you will get the robe. Which is what I did for the fight club coffee mug robe. Got it brand new in the box is 5 days. I‚Äôm so sorry to those of you who might have seen my post and ordered. I meant well and had faith. If you ordered and have yet to receive your robe, please message me. I can and will make legal waves. I refuse to be ripped off for hundreds for a damn robe.

I see other kids having tantrums too but more like if they have to wait their turn, have a toy taken off them ect 
She has a tantrum because I say ‚Äúbe careful, or you just ran into that boy, you‚Äôre going to hurt someone if you do that‚Äù it‚Äôs like she hates being told wat to do.

Other parents kind of move their child away from her at times because she‚Äôs been a bit mean or she‚Äôs not allowing their child freedom to play.
Like the way she took over that girl on the slide.

I always apologise and move her from the situation.

She also hates being told to wait, like she‚Äôs reallllll bossy.
Tells us what to do, ‚Äúdrive now!!‚Äù 

When we got in the car after class, I had to quickly make an important message and I couldn‚Äôt drive for a few minutes and she was getting so angry at me, she stopping her feet saying we need to go now and when I said no, I have to do something you need to wait. She was aggressively Grunting at me and making these low but main screams that are quite horrible to hear since she‚Äôs turned 2 1/2, she‚Äôs got a different personality.
Yesterday she was difficult all day. She had to wait in line with me as I needed to get a coffee but she wanted to run off and get leaves and I told her she couldn‚Äôt do that. She had to hold my hand and wait so she just threw her head back and started getting aggressive and wanted to have a tantrum in the afternoon. I was probably in a bit of a bad mood because she had been so defying all day and I don‚Äôt know if she did this in spite but I walked into the lounge room and she was staring at me as she was drawing crayons on the TV. She knew it was wrong like the way she was looking at me.

I‚Äôm really starting to struggle with her personality. I don‚Äôt know if this is starting to become some sort of personality disorder like defiant opposition or if this is like a hard to diagnosis/low spectrum autism in girls I know you guys might think I‚Äôm crazy for saying this. 
Because she can have a conversation with someone, her speech is incredible and she always spoke early but she‚Äôs always so angry and defiant and doesn‚Äôt wanna listen like on another level.

I feel like this needs  specialist review because when I take her to the doctors for a check up she‚Äôs on her 100% best behaviour.

Like an angel for the doctor so I feel like she needs to be observed while playing and with other kids or at home because she‚Äôs being quite terrible lately.

I love her to death but she‚Äôs been testing me the past few weeks.

She‚Äôs always been extra sensitive.
She was a quiet newborn until 6 months then she started screaming a lot it became intense at 9 months.
Like reallllly extreme crying for everything.

People in the family noticed it and will often say remember she would scream like a terradavtor? Or she was wild.

Now as a toddler that she talks she screams less but she‚Äôs so mad.

I‚Äôm hoping for some advice and support. I weigh 235 lbs and am 5feet 6inches. I started my diet after fasting about a week ago. My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women‚Äôs multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water.

I have terminal stage 4 breast cancer and some liver problems, and I am also obese. I started keto mainly for weight loss, liver repair, and to help fight my cancer because I‚Äôve heard from many people and research that it helps fight cancer.

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation.

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

Thank you all in advance for your help and kindness.",3,1751423379.0,ketobeginners,3,1.0,False

It's been a year since I've been out on a date, and before that I hadn't dated anyone in roughly 7 years (I've been working on my career and doing some emotional healing from some very traumatic relationships).

This year, I felt confident and wanted to get back out there. Since I'm not into the club/bar scene and my friend group is small, I decided to go the dating app route. Instantly, I matched with various guys, but there was one in particular who stood out. 

After about a week and a half of easy back-n-forth conversation, he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee that week. I said yes, but that I wouldn't be available until the following weekend. He said he'd be out of town that day, but he said we could touch base when he got back in town.

Another week went by and he came back to town, but didn't message me. I realize this could've been his way of demonstrating he was no longer interested, but I also figured he may have gotten busy with work because that's happened to me before. So, I just sent a quick, no pressure message saying that if he was still interested in meeting when our schedules align I was up for it, too. I got zero response. 

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if this was a guy I was ""iffy"" about, but this guy was pretty close to what I'm looking for in a partner. And the fact that he has ghosted me (but strangely hasn't unmatched with me) sort of hurts and is upsetting because it has me questioning my judgement with men because he seemed mature enough to at least say, ""No thanks"" or something. It's ridiculous, but this situation is also bringing up uncomfortable feelings of rejection, and triggering me to overthink and wonder if I did something wrong. 

Again, I understand it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, but there's that little voice in my head that says, ""See, another guy you're interested in rejected you"". I've done a lot of work on myself and I really am ready for a relationship, but because of how much work I've done, I feel fragile some days and want to be extremely cautious. With situations like this, it makes me worried that all the work I've done is going to fly out the window. Or that I can't trust my judgement.

1lpjztd,https://i.redd.it/4r8r54o7cdaf1.png,[Multi lines+] Out of his Element. (prompt in body),"Another RP prompt with this boy because I yearn to write the other side of him! 

Yuji Nomura is a 24 year old man living a double life. Every now and again, he masquerades as the low-level villain Puppeteer, a villain known for his love of theatrics and bubble shaped pocket worlds (see my last post for more details). But the rest of the time, he's just an intern at a hero agency.

But as of right now, Yuji is just a normal man getting a coffee and trying to enjoy his day off. That is, until a wrench gets thrown in his plans: his own stupidity, and possibly, someone's keen eye?

Details:

This is a modern day setting with classic hero/villain dynamics. It is common for heroes and villains alike to form groups or agencies. Yuji so happens to be an errand boy intern at one of the larger agencies in his city, while also being a villain that many don't take very seriously.

## ‚òÜ Prompt:

*Yuji strolls out from a coffee shop, cup in hand. He isn't too noticeable, in fact, in his opinion, that's one of his worst traits. So many just walk right past him without batting an eye.*

*Although, ever since he started running his show (as he liked to call being a villain on the side in his head) he started to appreciate the fact that no one cared to look at him for very long.*

*Yuji's appearance was generic, to say the least. If you didn't marvel at the contours of his face for too long, you wouldn't recognize this normal, black-haired gray-eyed young man as a harbinger of evil. His face was always partially covered in costume anyway.*

 *But back to his point, (why did he think that? no one was talking to him.) no one would have picked him out of a crowd, especially in his current attire‚Äîwhich was but a white hoodie with a black turtleneck underneath.*

*He was still fine to show his face in public as long as he didn't make a scene of himself.*

*...And of course, right as he thought that, he bumped directly into someone.*

*Yuji gasped as he collided with another person, the coffee cup he held was squished between them and left the lid to pop off. The liquid splashed over both of their clothes, leaving a confused Yuji visibly mortified.*

""O-Oh, goodness, I'm so sorry-"" *He stammered out, reaching into his pocket and grabbing out a handful of crumpled napkins.* ""I-I'll handle that, ah-""

*Shit. Not only did he have to deal with possibly injuring the wrath of a stranger, he also had to worry about being recognized! They wouldn't though, would they? With his glasses and his mask hiding his chin...that was always how it worked in the movies...*

Do you enjoy relatively hard sci-fi detective-noir stories set in the near future, with enough humor to leaven the final product? This tale is set in the world of tomorrow; one shackled to the problems of today. A world bound by the laws of thermodynamics, where faster-than-light travel is the stuff of science fiction and teleportation is a mad fever dream. This story takes place in the next century, where late-stage capitalism and increasing reliance on genetic and cybernetic optimization has produced a mistrusted transhuman minority class. This is a world where the promise of a better tomorrow has been broken to pieces, where science couldn't lift humanity beyond our nature, or even beyond our solar system.*

*\\Where humanity previously surged from Earth on waves of subliminal chemical rockets and fusion engines, surfing the tsunami of accelerated scientific development, we now stagnate. The collapse of the tech bubble and the following economic crash precede years of armed conflict, leaving humanity scattered across the solar system in an aborted diaspora. In a society where life is cheap and everything else is expensive, an increasingly cyber-civilization wars with itself as unmodified humans retaliate against a future that left them behind.*

*This is a world in which technology has improved by leaps and bounds, but where people are still chained to the economic systems we 'enjoy' today. It's a world where unmodified (or 'baseline') humans find their abilities increasingly obsolete, and their skillsets ever less competitive in job markets filled with made-to-order AI. In this world, in defiance of the saccharine dreams of futurists and transhumanists and tech-cultists everywhere, utopia remains a fantasy. In a time when technology has advanced to the point of human-mind uploading and interplanetary travel, capitalism is still king.*

*The creaking, ad-hoc system flounders at the straining limits of its decaying reach. Oligarchs and mega-corporations feud over the isolated clusters of civilization among the void. A pseudo-government, formed to reign in the remnants of armed conflict and underground factions, finds itself policing a semi-lawless frontier beyond the core planets. Code Enforcement Officers desperately try to stem the tide of malware, hackers, and evolving synthetic life undermining the digital systems on which humanity relies. But don't worry; even in the darkness of the future, for the beleaguered digital cop, there will still be coffee.*

**Synopsis:**

Both as a cop and a person, Lieutenant Mel Cruz is consistently dealt a crap hand.¬† She's a jaded officer coming to terms with the wreckage of her romantic life, a near fatal injury, and an acerbic new captain.¬† Following her transfer to a new unit, she desperately tries to hold her life together while rebuilding her career.¬† Oh, and she's a 34-year-old Scouting Officer for the Code Enforcement branch of the Exonet Maintenance Bureau.¬† To put it in Luddite, she's a cyborg law enforcement officer, and digital systems are her beat.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.¬† Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.¬† A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.¬† And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

I‚Äôm hoping for some advice and support. I weigh 235 lbs and am 5feet 6inches. I started my diet after fasting about a week ago. My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women‚Äôs multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water. 

I have terminal stage 4 breast cancer and some liver problems, and I am also obese. I started keto mainly for weight loss, liver repair, and to help fight my cancer because I‚Äôve heard from many people and research that it helps fight cancer. 

Right now I‚Äôm having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation. 

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I‚Äôve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I‚Äôm doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren‚Äôt that hungry?

>**TL;DR:** The AI slop wars aren‚Äôt about slop vs quality. They‚Äôre about how we read, trust, and care in an age of semiotic flood.

**üëã Context / Purpose:**

The recent waves of AI discourse here ‚Äî the debates, fears, enthusiasm, suspicion ‚Äî have inspired me to step back and try to frame what I see as the deeper stakes beyond *just* pro/con AI arguments.

This isn‚Äôt meant to be a ‚Äúside‚Äù in the slop wars. It‚Äôs an attempt to describe the terrain we‚Äôre all on now, together ‚Äî and to suggest how we might navigate it.

What follows is a dense, reflective piece that *doesn‚Äôt aim to convince you to like or dislike AI-generated content*. It aims to explore **what abundance, automation, and the flood of language do to attention, trust, and meaning itself**.

I‚Äôm posting it here because r/sorceryofthespectacle strikes me as one of the few places where people might want to chew on this together.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Fair warning:** This is long, layered, and probably better read with a coffee or tea in hand. If you‚Äôre not up for that right now, or have better things to do than read AI slop, I respect that! No shame in bailing. If you do read, I welcome your responses ‚Äî critical, supportive, challenging ‚Äî as long as we keep to good faith.

**TL;DR:**  
The AI slop wars aren‚Äôt about slop vs quality. They‚Äôre about how we read, trust, and care in an age of semiotic flood. The crisis isn‚Äôt bad content drowning good ‚Äî it‚Äôs how attention and trust erode when language overflows and mirrors us back, potentially without care or responsibility. The task ahead isn‚Äôt purity or conquest, but building discernment, humility, and collective navigation.

# The Flood of Language

We are living through a crisis of abundance. Not of food or shelter, but of words. Where language was once scarce‚Äîeach sentence a product of human thought and labor‚Äîit now overflows our channels, loosed by large language models (LLMs) that churn out oceans of prose, commentary, dialogue, and code. What once astonished (translation, summarization, synthetic creativity) now overwhelms.

The metaphor of the flood isn‚Äôt chosen lightly. Water sustains life but drowns when unchecked. So too with language. The tools we built to aid expression now deluge us with surface polish at scale. Meaning isn‚Äôt destroyed by malevolence‚Äîit‚Äôs drowned by volume.

# The Mirror of Automation

The mirror rises alongside the flood. LLMs reflect us: our language, our styles, our thoughts. They mimic fluently, sometimes uncannily. We look in, seeking recognition, and are unsettled: *Is this voice mine? Is this thought mine?* The boundary between tool and self blurs.

But this mirror isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs the product of a vast, brute-force project: billions of dollars spent training models on nearly everything publicly available online. The goal wasn‚Äôt wisdom, but coverage ‚Äî to extend fluently into whatever we begin, to predict what might come next in any style, on any topic. These systems are not ‚Äúall-knowing‚Äù in a human sense, but all-encompassing in a na√Øve, statistical way. Their omniscience is hollow: a mirror polished by volume, not by understanding.

And let‚Äôs be honest: the flood and the mirror only dramatize truths that always existed. Words have never carried inherent meaning. Language has always been relational ‚Äî a fragile trust between speaker and listener, writer and reader. The abundance of automated text forces us to confront what was always so: meaning isn‚Äôt in the marks themselves, but in the attention, care, and shared context that frame them.

# The False Binary-Slop vs Quality

In the face of this flood, we instinctively reach for frames. The simplest? Slop vs quality. On one side, noise; on the other, craft. A comforting story‚Äîbut a false one.

All language contains slop. Redundancy, clich√©, ambiguity‚Äîthese are not AI inventions. They are conditions of human communication. What‚Äôs changed is scale. Machines don‚Äôt create noise; they amplify it. The binary between slop and quality collapses under the weight of abundance. A single brilliant phrase can be lost in a sea of polished mediocrity. A flawed passage can still carry the spark of insight.

Yet we cling to this frame because it flatters us. It lets us moralize, draw lines, take sides. But the flood does not care for our categories. The mirror reflects both slop and quality indiscriminately. And in fighting this false battle, we miss the deeper stakes.

# The Real Crisis: Attention and Trust

This isn‚Äôt about bad content drowning good. The real crisis is the exhaustion of attention ‚Äî the most finite resource we have ‚Äî and the erosion of trust. Historically, meaning arose from slow, relational processes: editorial rigor, peer review, conversation in trusted circles. These didn‚Äôt just filter information ‚Äî they conferred accountability. Someone stood behind the words.

LLMs disrupt this ecology. They produce content effortlessly, saturating our channels. And with saturation, the signal that once helped us sense care, responsibility, and intent begins to blur. Even polished text may lack lineage or responsibility. Our filters ‚Äî cognitive and social ‚Äî strain under the flood. We skim, tire, grow suspicious or indifferent. We lose the capacity to sense where *care* lives. And when that capacity erodes, shared meaning collapses.

This isn‚Äôt just about information. It‚Äôs about cognition. When the cues that orient trust are washed out, we disengage ‚Äî not because we don‚Äôt care, but because we can no longer *tell* where care exists. The conditions for shared thought begin to collapse.

# Mirror-Lust and Paranoia

Automation‚Äôs mirror stirs twin impulses: desire and fear. **Mirror-lust** is the thrill of extension ‚Äî seeing the tool amplify our voice, our style, our creativity. We delight in fluency at scale. The machine seems a co-creator, a tireless helper.

But that same mirror breeds **paranoia**: fear that fluency exposes our redundancy, that meaning is hollowed out, that our voice can be too easily simulated. The mirror flatters ‚Äî then mocks.

These impulses feed each other. The more we identify with the tool, the more we fear being replaced. The more we fear hollow meaning, the more we seek to master the machine. We oscillate in a strange loop ‚Äî desire, dread, projection, disavowal.

üëâ **This loop isn‚Äôt just a distraction. It‚Äôs the engine of the slop wars ‚Äî an externalization of our internal crisis. We fight over slop and quality because we are fighting for the survival of discernment itself.**

# Toward a New Literacy

If the flood won‚Äôt recede and the mirror won‚Äôt break, our task isn‚Äôt to resist their presence, but to learn to navigate. The age of abundance is here. There‚Äôs no dam to build, no ark to board, no safe shore untouched. What remains is to develop a new literacy‚Äîa literacy of discernment.

This literacy asks us to:

* **Read through the noise.** Don‚Äôt default to suspicion or cynicism. Learn to look for the imprint of care, the trace of accountability.
* **Distinguish tool-for-thought from mask-for-absence.** The former extends human care. The latter simulates it. The difference isn‚Äôt always obvious‚Äîbut this is where discernment lives.
* **Privilege transparency of process over fluency of output.** Ask: *What is the lineage of these words? Where is the trace of responsibility?*
* **Practice discernment over dismissal.** Reflexive rejection only deepens collapse. We need generosity *and* rigor.

Such literacy is not an individual hero‚Äôs quest. It‚Äôs a collective project. Communities that thrive amid abundance will be those that build shared filters, shared rituals of attention, shared compacts of trust.

# Navigating Together

This isn‚Äôt a war between human and machine. It‚Äôs a civic task. A cultural task. The virtues we need aren‚Äôt mastery or conquest, but humility, discernment, care.

Navigation looks like:

* Platforms that value disclosure over polish.
* Publics that reject both mirror-lust and paranoia.
* Communities that steer together ‚Äî not for purity, but coherence.

The flood will shift. The mirror will distort anew. The work is ongoing. The meaning is made in the act of steering together through uncertainty.

# The Gift of Discernment

There‚Äôs no final victory in the slop wars. No tool will rescue us. The flood of language is permanent. The mirror of automation is permanent. What remains is the ethic of discernment: the daily discipline of reading with grace and rigor, asking *who speaks here, for whom, with what care?*.

Discernment isn‚Äôt a destination. It‚Äôs a way of inhabiting the world we‚Äôve made. The question isn‚Äôt *can we win?* The question is: *can we live, think, and mean well, even here?*",0,1751421453.0,sorceryofthespectacle,6,0.5,False

Also forgive me for thinking aloud/in writing.

I work remotely for a big company, going on two years there. The team I'm on has been remote for almost a decade, so the odds of RTO are almost nil. This job also lets me work part-time, which is a miracle. I can get my kids off the school bus. The job is also teaching me a niche and in-demand skill. I acknowledge that I am very, very lucky and don't mean to sound like a brat.

The trouble is that I'm SO lonely. I'm very extroverted. At my old job, I had lots of friends, with whom I routinely got coffee, chatted, strolled, etc. I'm still in a book club with some friends from that job, two group chats, saw two of them and their spouses last weekend, they know my kids, etc.

In my new job, I am alone all day. My brain is starting to glitch. I sometimes eat something or drink coffee just to feel something, to have something to enjoy in the day.

I work with a lot of male engineers, and it's hard to chitchat with them over a Teams call. And sometimes the work is dull (which is why they pay me).  The company does have an office nearby, but none of the people on my team are there. I went in once, and nobody was talking.

I can't go to a coffee shop because I need two screens. I have gone over to a friend's house to work a few times, which is great, but it feels inconsiderate to take calls.

So what should I do? I don't think it makes sense to leave this miracle part-time remote job while my kids are small (6 and 3). Right??

I could lean into really social evenings, but it's hard to summon the energy after dinner and bedtime. I could also go into the local office and be patient about making friends there.

Do you have any advice? Any other extroverts out there with hints for remote work?

I am grateful for your life, really, for all the kilig, coffees, and late night convos we had because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel kilig again. I‚Äôd like to think that there really was an invisible string tying you to me and me to you.

We've been friends for about 2 years (I started liking her a few months ago), but never really hung out just the two of us outside our friend group. We ended up going out a few other times/both told each other we have feelings for each other within the next 2 weeks. The problem was then that after those 2 weeks I had to leave for the summer. We're both in the same college program, so we'll see each other probably in August when I get back. We've also been texting at least once a week, if not more, while I've been gone.

We never really had the talk of ""making it official"", but I'm fairly certain neither of us have any plans to see other people. I'm just worried it might be too soon, or not the right time.

Should I just ask her to be my girlfriend officially? Or should I wait until I get back and see how things go? Also, what are good ways to ask a girl long-distance to be my girlfriend if that's the right path?

Sorry for all the questions and rambling. I have like zero dating experience, so I get really anxious about this stuff and never really know what to do. Any advice is really appreciated!

1lpjj8r,https://v.redd.it/8rzded6x7daf1,"Screen recording of ""Balaban Channel"" archived YouTube live stream making false accusations against an innocent person","This happened a few months ago back in 2024. A Youtube channel named Balaban Channel and in this screen recording shows his bad behavior towards an innocent person. This screen recording on YouTube taken by ""Pwappo of E-Town Records"" caught Balaban Channel saying all those lies and making false accusations against someone innocent for ""stealing his money"" and calling him a thief even if he's not a thief. And he keeps making false accusations that he's stealing everyone's information and that's not true because when you send money to someone on Venmo, PayPal, Coffee, etc you don't see the information. And the person isn't even asking for money and Balaban channel just straight up making false accusations against him for stealing money for no reason. And then he goes around telling his viewers to unsubscribe to the victim and he can't do that because it's their choice. It's not Balaban Channel's job to tell his viewers what to do. And a few times i caught him bragging about how he has more subscribers than him but in reality Balaban Channel is buying subscribers because it doesn't make sense that now he has 3.24k subscribers and his channel views are at 27,277. I know Balaban Channel doesn't go live that much and thinks he can just move on forgetting about what he did but I'm just sharing out on what he really is because he never apologized to that person he was slandering and this is taken in

There was a mailbox growing in the faculty lounge.

It had sprouted overnight between the coffee machine and the bulletin board where Professor Millicent Threadwhistle posted her increasingly cryptic notices about ""Temporal Hygiene and You."" The mailbox was brass, tarnished with age, and hummed softly with the particular resonance of correspondence that would never be delivered.

Thomas Bramble discovered it while checking on his latest project: a hive of philosophical bees that had recently begun spelling out existential questions in their honeycomb. The bees were agitated this morning, buzzing in a dialect he recognized as Old Melancholic, a language spoken primarily by trees during their loneliest seasons.

""Undelivered letters,"" he said to the mailbox, the way one might greet an old acquaintance. ""How many?""

The mailbox's flag twitched upward. Thomas opened it carefully. Inside, envelopes spilled forth like autumn leaves, thousands of them, each one radiating the particular sadness of words never spoken, apologies never made, declarations of love that arrived too late or too early or in the wrong dimension entirely.

A note was pinned to the inside of the mailbox door, written in handwriting that seemed to shift between scripts:

Property of the Department of Postal Archaeology. Do not redistribute. Contents may cause spontaneous weeping, temporal displacement, or the sudden urge to write poetry.

Thomas sighed and closed the mailbox. The philosophical bees had arranged themselves into a question mark.

""I know,"" he told them. ""Me too.""

The Department of Postal Archaeology had been established six months after the Memory's disappearance, when the university discovered that forgotten correspondence was accumulating in the spaces between things. Love letters lost in transit. Angry missives that arrived after their recipients had forgiven the sender. Birthday cards that materialized decades late, still cheerful despite their obsolescence.

The department chair was Dr. Ophelia Inkwell, a former lighthouse keeper who had spent forty years guiding ships through storms made of unspoken words. She wore spectacles that helped her read between the lines literally and kept a pet raven named Postscript who specialized in delivering messages to the recently deceased.

""The situation is escalating,"" she explained to Thomas over tea that tasted of nostalgia and regret. ""We've had reports of entire conversations manifesting as geographical features. A heated argument between lovers has formed a canyon in the eastern meadow. The philosophy department's debate about the nature of existence has become a small mountain range that keeps changing its mind about which direction is up.""

Thomas stirred his tea thoughtfully. ""And the undelivered mail?""

""Piling up everywhere. The dormitories are knee deep in missed opportunities. Professor Grimbaldi's office has been completely overrun by thank you notes that arrived too late to matter. And don't get me started on the valentine that's been circling the campus for thirty years, still looking for someone named Margaret who may or may not have been a metaphor.""

Through the window, Thomas could see students navigating around what appeared to be a heated discussion about soup that had crystallized into a small maze of contradictory statements. A group of philosophy students was using it as a study aid.

""What do you need from me?"" he asked.

Dr. Inkwell leaned forward conspiratorially. ""We need someone to map them. All the lost conversations, the undelivered words, the spaces where silence has grown thick enough to cultivate. We need a cartographer of lost conversations.""

""I'm a beekeeper,"" Thomas said.

""You're also the only person who's successfully communicated with a living archive,"" she replied. ""The conversations trust you. They remember how gently you listened to the Memory.""

The map began as a simple grid of the campus, sketched on parchment made from the bark of a tree that had once been a particularly eloquent poet. But as Thomas walked the grounds, listening for the whisper of unspoken words, the map began to grow more complex.

Here: a cluster of apologies that had formed a grove of weeping willows.

There: a field of wildflowers that bloomed in the shape of words people had meant to say but never did.

Near the library: a small pond that reflected not the sky, but conversations that might have been, if people had been braver or kinder or simply awake at the right moment.

The most challenging area was the old dragon's crater, where the Memory had first been discovered. The space was thick with layered dialogue, arguments that had been interrupted, confessions cut short, laughter that had echoed long after the speakers were gone. Thomas could feel it all pressing against his consciousness like a crowd of polite ghosts, each one waiting for their turn to be heard.

He set up his equipment there: a compass that pointed toward honesty, a telescope that revealed the emotional weather patterns of the past, and a simple notebook for recording what he found. The philosophical bees accompanied him, humming in harmonies that helped translate the more obscure conversational fossils.

On the third day, he found her.

She was sitting at the edge of the crater, visible only from the corner of his eye, wearing a dress made of pressed flowers and carrying a basket full of unmailed postcards. When he looked at her directly, she became translucent, but her voice remained clear.

""I've been waiting,"" she said.

""For what?"" Thomas asked.

""For someone to ask the right question.""

Thomas consulted his notes. The map showed a convergence here, a place where thousands of lost conversations spiraled inward like water around a drain. He looked up at the woman, who was now flickering like candlelight.

""What question should I ask?""

She smiled, and for a moment became solid enough to cast a shadow. ""Why do words become lost in the first place?""

Thomas thought about this. ""Fear? Pride? Bad timing?""

""Deeper,"" she said. ""Think like a Memory.""

And suddenly he understood. Words didn't become lost because they were unspoken. They became lost because they were unspeakable, too true, too dangerous, too necessary to risk saying aloud. They were the sentences that would change everything if they were uttered. The conversations that would heal old wounds or create new ones.

""They're not lost,"" Thomas said slowly. ""They're hidden.""

The woman nodded. ""And now they want to come out of hiding.""

The revelation changed everything. Dr. Inkwell called an emergency faculty meeting in the Great Hall, where the walls themselves leaned in to listen. The assembled professors including a phoenix who taught Advanced Resurrection Theory and a clockwork golem who specialized in Temporal Mechanics watched as Thomas presented his findings.

""The undelivered mail, the crystallized conversations, the geographical arguments, none of it is random,"" he explained. ""It's all connected. The campus is becoming a repository for dangerous honesty. Words that were too powerful to speak when they were first thought.""

Professor Threadwhistle raised a tentative hand. ""What happens if we let them all out at once?""

""Chaos,"" said Dr. Inkwell. ""Or transformation. Possibly both.""

The phoenix preened thoughtfully. ""In my experience, they tend to be the same thing.""

They decided to proceed carefully. Working with the Department of Postal Archaeology, Thomas began to create delivery routes for the safest messages first. Thank you notes were distributed to their intended recipients (even if they arrived decades late, gratitude was rarely unwelcome). Birthday wishes were delivered to graves, where they bloomed as memorial flowers. Simple expressions of friendship were sent out as morning dew that spelled out kind words on windows.

But the deeper conversations, the ones thick with consequence, those required more delicate handling.

Chester the badger had become the unofficial coordinator of the project. His background in Magical Epistemology and Comparative Biscuitry made him uniquely qualified to understand both the theoretical implications of delayed communication and the practical importance of proper snack preparation during emotionally challenging work.

""The angry letters are the trickiest,"" he explained to Thomas over tea and honey cakes. ""Anger that's been fermenting for decades becomes quite volatile. We had an explosion last week when someone finally received a complaint about noise levels from 1987. The recipient had been wondering why their neighbor stopped speaking to them for thirty seven years.""

Thomas nodded. ""What about the love letters?""

""Bittersweet,"" Chester said. ""Some of them arrive just in time. Others..."" He gestured toward the window, where a small cloud was raining rose petals over the memorial garden. ""Others become weather.""

The project continued through the autumn. Slowly, carefully, the accumulated conversations began to find their way to where they belonged. The campus geography shifted as arguments were resolved and apologies were finally delivered. The canyon created by the lovers' quarrel filled with a stream of reconciliation. The philosophy department's existential mountain range settled into a lovely valley of contemplative acceptance.

But the most profound change was in the people themselves. Professors who had harbored decades of professional grudges found themselves having awkward but necessary conversations over coffee. Students discovered that their parents had been trying to say ""I'm proud of you"" in letters that had been lost in interdimensional mail delays. The custodial staff, who had been ignored for years, suddenly found themselves receiving decades of overdue appreciation.

On the winter solstice, Thomas made his final entry in the map of lost conversations. The campus was quieter now, but it was the peaceful quiet of things that had been said and heard, rather than the heavy quiet of words held back.

The woman in the flower dress appeared one last time, solid and smiling.

""Thank you,"" she said. ""I can go home now.""

""Where is home?"" Thomas asked.

""The place where all the important conversations happen,"" she replied. ""The space between one word and the next, where truth lives.""
She handed him her basket of unmailed postcards. Each one was blank.
""For next time,"" she said, and faded into the evening air.

Thomas returned to his bees, who had spent the season composing a symphony about the importance of saying difficult things at the right time. The philosophical bees had been joined by a small colony of pragmatic bees, who specialized in conversations about grocery lists and the weather, but somehow made even mundane communication feel sacred.
Dr. Inkwell established a permanent postal route for delayed correspondence, staffed by a rotating crew of graduate students and supervised by Postscript the raven. The Department of Postal Archaeology published a groundbreaking paper on ""The Emotional Geology of Unspoken Words"" that became required reading in seven different fields.
And Chester, having discovered a talent for counseling people through difficult conversations, opened a small practice in the basement of the library. His business cards read: ""Chester Brambleworth, Licensed Facilitator of Overdue Discussions. Biscuits provided.""
But Thomas's favorite development was the new mailbox that appeared in the faculty lounge. This one was silver, polished bright, and hummed with the gentle resonance of letters that would definitely be delivered‚Äîmaybe not immediately, but certainly when they were most needed.
The brass plaque on its side read: ""For words that are ready to be spoken. Courage not included but available upon request.""
On still mornings, when the wind carried the scent of honey and possibility, Thomas could hear the conversations that were yet to come. They rustled like pages waiting to be written, patient and full of hope.
The philosophical bees spelled out a question in their honeycomb: ""What will you say when you're ready?""
Thomas smiled and made a note to write a letter to his sister. He'd been meaning to tell her about the dragons.

After a surprisingly difficult round for most with injuries and underperforming premos, we find ourselves in the home stretch and back to best-22 scoring, where those that have planned and built their team well over the preceeding weeks should begin to see the benefits. Trades remain precious and many will be making the tough decision between finishing or augmenting their team with another premo, and saving trades to cover for injuries. Players listed below could be considered for finishing the final positions in your team, or as an option if you are trading out a long term injury.


**DEFENDERS**


**Zorko - 510K**, had decent form over the previous two weeks, and has decent matchups against PTA and CAR the next two weeks, although follows this with a difficult run home against some decently-performing sides. Zorko seems to be a decent pick if you can't afford the 547K+ premos and already have Stewart.


**Rozee - 547K** - played a phenomenal game last week against an abysmal Carlton side, and he's someone that should be included in most sides. Has demonstrated reliable scoring with a great role, the majority of the kickins, a high ceiling, and is sitting at an achieveable price of 547K.


**Dale - 550K**, wasn't quite his usual self last week and reportedly played with a slight injury, but has a fantastic run home that should allow him to finish the year strongly.


**Ash - 557K**, the most expensive of the options on the list, but also the one I would expect to score most highly this week. With Whitfield absent this week due to concussion, Ash should have a field day against WCE given he'll be the primary kickin and distribution player coming out of the backline. For context, he scored 130 against WCE earlier in the year in a game where he only took 1 of 9 kickins and shared the distribution with Whitfield. Given that he's currently sitting at D2 and has a run home that includes ESS/NTH/STK, he is an amazing inclusion at this price.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


Thomas the Intercept Engine.


**Stewart - 504K**, has looked back to decent but not career-best form since return from injury in round 11, achieveing the top score for the Cats in their loss against Brisbaine, and this week plays against an undermanned Richmond forward line with minimal competition for aerial ball. Not only does he have RIC this week, but he follows this up with games against STK/NTH/PTA/ESS and RIC again to finish the year. Given he has demonstrated stability and scoring capacity since return from injury, it's perhaps a bit harsh to list him as a speculative pick, and I would highly rate this selection.


**MIDFIELDERS**


**Caldwell - 520K**, in retrospect the time to bring him in was clearly following return from injury for the match against Richmond, but he has demonstrated over the previous 5 weeks that he's in career best form and has maintained high CBAs each week. He's got some favourable matchups over the coming weeks and should avoid the high volume of upcoming tags (that should go to Merrett), so the inflated (but still undervalued) price of 520K is very reasonable.


**Bontempelli - 568K**, if we make the assumption that every single person who is actively playing supercoach has either previously brought in McCarthy or is trading them in this week, we can see that there are about ~100K active players. At present there are 70K people with Bont, which means 30K active players have yet to bring him in. Of all the players in the premium-but-achieveable price range of 550-590K, Bont is the one that I mostly highly recommend to bring in this week. He is playing against North, against whom he scored 123/157/169 points in the previous 3 games, and has a great run home with only 2-3 tag games upcoming (tags that may go to Richards given his performance this year). The choice to not bring him in when he was 600K+ is understandable, but continuing to omit him by choice (even with the recent ~60 scores) would be a brave decision.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


The Neale-deal?


**Neale - 512K**, unfortunately given his capacity to tear games apart when not tagged, teams have taken to sitting on him to take him out of the game with great effect. His inclusion here is due to the novel scoring dynamics of Supercoach this year with best 22 scoring from 23 players. This means that one approach is to have your 23rd player as someone who has the capacity to have a high scoring ceiling game but who may not bring those reliable 100+ scores each week. With Neale currently at his lowest price since 2021 and a clear capacity for a spike score, he could be one such player to be considered for inclusion, and should only have 2-3 tag games over the final weeks of the season.


**RUCKS**


We've seen over the latter half of the year that not only is TDK at risk of reduced scoring from job-sharing with Pittonet, but also that he's susceptible to being double-teamed by opponent ruck pairs. Unforunately he has matches against FRE and PTA where the dual pairing is near a certainty, and the ever present threat of Pittonet endures. With a BE of 158 and a formidable opponent in Cameron, this is the week to decide whether or not to move him on, if you wait any longer you'll need to add a significant amount of cash to his head to match the price of any of the reachable second-tier rucks.


To avoid repeating the summary of the available rucks from last week ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFLSupercoach/comments/1lj3khu/the_trading_post_round_16_2025/)), if you have unlimited cash this week pick **Grundy - 707K** (2.8% owned, 5-Round average of 152, and matches against GEE/ESS/WCE upcoming), if you have a reasonable bank then pick **Marshall - 531K** or **Cameron - 578K** as funds permit, if you need a poverty speculative pick then consider **Darcy - 361K** who had 9 hitouts-to-advantage and 70% of the ruck contests last week in a shared role with Jackson.


**FORWARDS**


**Moore - 469K**, the 775 new Dylan Moore enjoyers who brought him in last week will be pleased with their new investment, and I would continue to back him to perform in Hawthorn's push for a top four finish over the remaining 8 weeks. He's a great pick if you need a cheap FWD and already have Darcy and Macrae.


**Darcy - 483K**, still well priced following a poor second half against a Sydney backline that did their best to remove him from the game. He plays against an embarrasing NTH defence that allowed old-man Gunston to kick 7 goals against them last week, and I can't anticipate that they will have any answers for his height and the frequency of inside 50s that the WBD mids will provide. There's a very real chance we get to see Darcy's first 150+ score this week, and he should follow this up with more spike games against ESS/MEL/WCE to round out the year.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


**Warner - 461K**, earlier in the year I hopped on my soapbox to caution against the Warner inclusion given his cyclical runs of poor and spike scoring, which has been underscored by his 5 round average of 83. That being said, as discussed above with Neale, the context is different with a full-premo best 23, and Warner could be a value pick that has capacity to have spike games of 130+ scores amidst a baseline of mediocre 85-95 scores, working well in the flex position.


**ROOKIES**


As always, consider 99K DPP rookies if you're looking for the maximum trade-out value for your final trades.


**McCarthy - DEF/MID - 99K**, there are very few non-negotiables in Supercoach, but McCarthy is one. Not only could he break the record for largest price gain in a week since Gulden increased by 123.8K in 2021, his role and scoring output is good enough that he can fill the 23rd premo in a trade/cash-depleted team or as a 24th high-scoring loophole inclusion in a cashed-up team.


**May - FWD - 99K**, scored well last week with 83 off the back of 2 goals, and is priced at 99K, so if you're looking to maximise trade out value and don't need the DPP for flexibility, then why not bring in someone that's playing? Role may be threatened over the coming week if he underperforms with the imminent return of most of Essendon's playing group from injury, but he's worth a pick if selected this week.


The players discussed below are for consideration as inclusions for their role as bench cover for injuries rather than value, given that you're spending an extra 60K to bring them in.


**Rowston - 161K**, two great scores over the previous two weeks with full game time as the third CBA mid. While this role should go to Coniglio when he's healthy, Coniglio has already been confirmed to return via the VFL this week so we should be guarenteed another week of good role/scoring for Rowston. Although his role is threatened when Coniglio returns to the team, if Rowston he keeps perfoming at his current level it is hard to see him being dropped, so he's a decent selection for a cheap player as injury cover.


**Tauru - 163K**, looked the goods as an AFL-level player last week against Freo and there don't seem to be any players due to return over the coming weeks that could threaten his place in the team given Howard re-injuring his hamstring in training two weeks ago. 


Please let me know what your thoughts are on the players discussed, if there's any other trade options you're considering, and if there's anything else you'd like to see in these write-ups.",8,1751419730.0,AFLSupercoach,3,1.0,False

# The Sister Who Destroyed Everything

She stood on my doorstep at eleven-thirty on a Tuesday night, mascara streaking down her cheeks like war paint, her pregnant belly straining against a wrinkled designer dress I recognized from her Instagram posts. The porch light cast harsh shadows across her face as she clutched her phone with shaking hands, probably fresh from another argument with whoever had finally seen through her act. ""Please,"" she whispered, the word hanging between us like a prayer I wasn't sure I wanted to answer. After everything she'd done to me, after the years of betrayal and humiliation, now she wanted my help?

Let me tell you how we got here.

Growing up, I was the reliable Honda in our family driveway while Melissa was the flashy red Corvette that broke down every month but somehow always got more attention from the mechanics. You know how it is in some families - there's the golden child and then there's everyone else. I was everyone else, wrapped up in a single, forgettable package.

Mom used to say I was her ""steady one,"" which sounds like a compliment until you realize it's code for ""the one we don't have to worry about because she'll never cause any trouble."" Melissa, three years younger and born with the kind of effortless beauty that made people turn their heads on the street, was the one who got the worried phone calls, the emergency cash transfers, and the endless second chances.

I remember being fourteen, saving up for months from my part-time job at the local bookstore to buy this gorgeous vintage dress for homecoming. It was hanging in my closet, tags still on, when Melissa decided she simply had to have it for some party she'd been invited to at the last minute. When I came home from school that Friday, it was gone. Mom's explanation? ""She needed it more than you did, honey. Besides, you can always get another dress.""

But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was finding out later that she'd told everyone at the party it was a gift from her boyfriend - the same boyfriend who'd been flirting with me for weeks before she swooped in with her perfect smile and that laugh that could make boys forget their own names.

This became the pattern of our relationship. I would work for something, achieve something, build something, and Melissa would find a way to take credit, take the spotlight, or simply take it away from me entirely. When I made honor roll, she'd have a crisis that required all of Mom and Dad's attention. When I got accepted to my dream college, she'd announce some dramatic relationship saga that dominated every family conversation for weeks.

The thing about being the steady one is that people start to expect you to just absorb the chaos around you. They expect you to be understanding, to be the bigger person, to quietly step aside so the more dramatic personalities can take center stage. And for years, that's exactly what I did.

I went to college, studied hard, graduated with honors while Melissa dropped out of three different schools to ""find herself."" I got my first job at a marketing firm, worked late nights and weekends, slowly climbing the corporate ladder while she bounced between modeling gigs and failed business ventures that Dad always seemed happy to fund.

I met David at a conference in Chicago. He was presenting on digital marketing trends, and I was captivated not just by his expertise but by the way he listened when I shared my own insights during the Q&A session. He actually heard me - not as someone's daughter or sister, but as a professional with valuable thoughts worth considering.

We dated for two years before he proposed, and for the first time in my life, I felt like I was the star of my own story. David saw my worth in ways my family never had. He encouraged my career ambitions, celebrated my successes, and made me feel like I deserved to take up space in the world.

The wedding planning, though - that's when the old family dynamics came roaring back to life.

Melissa had just ended another relationship and was going through what Mom diplomatically called ""a rough patch."" Suddenly, every decision about my wedding became about how it might affect Melissa's fragile emotional state. The date I'd chosen was too close to her breakup anniversary. The venue I'd selected was where she'd had her first date with the ex. Even my choice of maid of honor dresses was somehow insensitive because the color reminded her of something painful.

""Can't you just be more considerate?"" Mom asked during one particularly exhausting conversation about seating arrangements. ""She's really struggling right now.""

But I held firm. For once in my life, I refused to shrink myself to make room for Melissa's drama. The wedding was beautiful, David and I were happy, and I thought maybe - finally - I'd broken free from the cycle of always putting everyone else's needs before my own.

We bought a house in a quiet neighborhood about an hour away from my parents. David got promoted to senior director at his firm, and I launched my own consulting business. Life was good. Better than good - it was mine.

For three blissful years, I maintained what therapists call ""healthy boundaries"" with my family. I sent birthday cards, showed up for major holidays, but I didn't get pulled into the weekly crisis calls or the emergency family meetings that always seemed to revolve around whatever mess Melissa had gotten herself into this time.

I heard through Mom that she'd moved in with some guy named Marcus, that she was waitressing at an upscale restaurant downtown, that she'd started taking yoga teacher training classes. It all sounded surprisingly stable for Melissa, and I'll admit I felt a cautious optimism that maybe she'd finally grown up.

I should have known better.

The anonymous text came on a Thursday afternoon while I was in a client meeting. Just a phone number I didn't recognize and a message that made my blood run cold: ""Check your husband's phone. The Park Hotel. Room 412. Every Tuesday for six months.""

My hands shook as I stared at those words. The rational part of my brain insisted it was probably spam, maybe someone trying to cause trouble, possibly even a wrong number. But something deep in my gut - that intuition women learn to trust when the world feels suddenly dangerous - told me this wasn't random.

I waited until David was in the shower that night, then did something I'd never imagined myself doing. I went through his phone.

The texts were all there. Months of them. Sweet, flirty messages that grew progressively more intimate. Photos I wished I could unsee. Plans for their Tuesday afternoon meetings that coincided perfectly with David's standing client lunch, the one he'd told me was with Peterson Industries, the account he'd been nurturing for months.

But it was the contact name that made my world collapse entirely: ""M ‚ù§Ô∏è""

Not just any M. My sister's number. I'd seen it a thousand times on family group texts.

I sat on our bathroom floor, reading through months of betrayal while the shower ran in the background, feeling like I was watching someone else's life fall apart in slow motion. The messages painted a picture of a relationship that had started ""innocently"" enough - David reaching out to plan a surprise for my birthday, Melissa offering to help coordinate with the family.

But somewhere in those conversations, innocent planning had turned into private jokes, which had turned into meeting for coffee, which had turned into something that shattered everything I thought I knew about my life.

The pregnancy news came three weeks later, delivered not through a gentle conversation or a family meeting, but through another anonymous text: ""Ask M about her doctor's appointment yesterday.""

When I confronted David, he didn't even try to deny it. He just sat at our kitchen table, head in his hands, and said, ""I never meant for this to happen."" As if intention somehow lessened the impact of the bomb he'd detonated in the middle of our marriage.

""How long?"" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady.

""Eight months,"" he whispered.

Eight months. While I was building my business, planning our future, talking about maybe starting a family of our own, my husband was creating a family with my sister.

The confrontation with Melissa was everything you'd expect and worse. She cried, she apologized, she swore it just ""happened naturally,"" as if affairs were weather patterns beyond human control. She begged me to understand, to forgive, to remember that we were sisters and sisters were supposed to forgive each other anything.

But it was my parents' reaction that broke something fundamental inside me.

""These things happen,"" Dad said, as if David and Melissa had accidentally bumped into each other in a hallway instead of deliberately deceiving me for the better part of a year. ""What matters now is how we handle it as a family.""

Mom nodded along, already shifting into crisis management mode. ""Melissa needs our support right now. She's scared and alone, and that baby is going to need stability.""

""What about what I need?"" I asked, genuinely curious to hear the answer.

The silence that followed told me everything I needed to know.

That's when I decided: Enough.

I filed for divorce the next week. David didn't contest it - I think he was actually relieved. I sold the house, took my half of everything, and moved to a downtown loft that overlooked the city skyline. I threw myself into my consulting business with the kind of focused intensity that only comes from having nothing left to lose.

And you know what? It turned out I was really good at it.

Within six months, I'd doubled my client base. Within a year, I'd hired two employees and was turning down projects because I couldn't keep up with demand. Success has a way of attracting more success, and suddenly I was the go-to consultant for companies looking to revolutionize their marketing strategies.

I also started therapy - not because I was falling apart, but because I was determined to understand how I'd allowed myself to become so invisible in my own family. Dr. Martinez helped me see the patterns I'd accepted as normal, the ways I'd been conditioned to shrink myself to accommodate other people's egos and emotions.

""You spent so many years being the supporting character in other people's stories,"" she said during one particularly insightful session, ""that you forgot you could be the heroine of your own.""

Meanwhile, the fairy tale romance between David and Melissa was predictably short-lived. Turned out that relationships built on deception and betrayal don't have the strongest foundations. Who could have seen that coming?

David lost his job about eight months after our divorce - something about irregularities in his expense reports. I heard through mutual friends that he'd been using company money to fund his hotel meetings with Melissa. The Peterson Industries account, the one he'd been supposedly nurturing during all those Tuesday afternoon disappearances? It never existed.

Melissa gave birth to a daughter she named Sophie, and for a brief moment, I wondered if motherhood might change her. But within weeks, she was back to her old patterns - calling Mom at all hours, demanding emergency babysitting, creating drama wherever she went.

David, facing his own financial ruin, grew resentful of the child support payments and the reality of being responsible for another human being. He started missing visits, then stopped showing up altogether. Last I heard, he'd moved to another state to ""start fresh,"" leaving Melissa to raise Sophie alone.

I wish I could say I felt vindicated watching their relationship implode, but mostly I just felt sad. Sad for the time I'd wasted, the energy I'd spent, the years I'd allowed other people's dysfunction to define my worth.

But I was learning something powerful: the best revenge isn't plotting someone else's downfall. It's building a life so fulfilling that their opinion of you becomes irrelevant.

My business continued to grow. I hired more staff, expanded into new markets, and eventually opened a second office in Seattle. I traveled for work, spoke at conferences, and found myself quoted in industry publications as an expert in digital transformation strategies.

I also started dating again - carefully, thoughtfully, but with an openness I'd never felt before. I learned the difference between men who wanted to possess me and men who wanted to partner with me. I discovered I had preferences and dealbreakers I'd never bothered to articulate before.

Three years after my divorce, I was sitting in my office overlooking the city when my assistant buzzed in with an urgent call from my father.

""We need to talk,"" he said, his voice heavy in a way I'd never heard before. ""Can you come over tonight?""

I found both my parents in their living room, looking older than I remembered, with stacks of papers spread across the coffee table between them. Bank statements, legal documents, something that looked like a police report.

""Sit down, sweetheart,"" Mom said, and I noticed her hands were shaking.

The story came out in pieces, like a puzzle assembling itself in reverse. Melissa had been stealing from them for months - forging checks, using their credit cards, even taking out a loan against their house using forged documents. The amounts were staggering, enough to threaten their retirement, their security, everything they'd worked for over forty years of marriage.

""We didn't want to believe it at first,"" Dad said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""She's our daughter. But the evidence...""

He gestured helplessly at the papers scattered between us.

The breaking point had come when they'd discovered she was selling things from their house - Mom's jewelry, Dad's vintage watch collection, even some of the family heirlooms that were supposed to be passed down through generations. She'd been taking advantage of their love and trust, counting on their desire to protect her to keep them from looking too closely at her activities.

""We've cut her off,"" Mom said, tears streaming down her face. ""Changed the locks, closed the joint accounts, everything. But we needed to tell you because..."" She looked at Dad, who nodded encouragingly. ""Because we need to make some things right.""

What followed was the conversation I'd been waiting my entire adult life to have with my parents. They apologized - genuinely, specifically, without qualifications or excuses - for the years of favoritism, for the way they'd minimized my achievements while excusing Melissa's failures, for asking me to be understanding while never requiring her to be accountable.

""We enabled her,"" Dad said simply. ""And we failed you. Both as parents and as people who should have seen your worth all along.""

But they weren't done.

""We've been talking to our attorney,"" Mom continued, ""about our estate planning. We want to make sure that what's left of our assets goes to someone who will use them responsibly, someone who has proven she can build something meaningful with her life.""

They handed me a folder containing updated will documents, trust information, and financial statements that made my head spin. The number at the bottom of the final page had so many zeros I had to count them twice.

Thirty-seven million dollars.

My parents had been far more successful with their investments over the years than any of us had realized. Dad's small accounting firm had grown into a regional powerhouse before he sold it. Mom's careful stock picks and real estate investments had compounded over decades. They lived modestly, drove practical cars, and apparently spent their retirement growing a fortune they'd never talked about.

""This isn't about punishing Melissa,"" Dad explained. ""This is about rewarding the daughter who chose to build rather than destroy, who chose responsibility over chaos.""

I sat in their living room, holding documents that represented more money than I'd ever imagined having, feeling strangely calm. This wasn't just inheritance - it was validation, recognition, a formal acknowledgment of the person I'd become despite the family dynamics that could have broken me.

Of course, Melissa found out within days. She had her ways of getting information, and news like this doesn't stay quiet for long in a small family.

The phone calls started immediately - angry, desperate, pleading calls that I let go to voicemail. Then came the texts, the emails, the messages through mutual friends. She tried everything: guilt, threats, promises to change, appeals to family loyalty.

When none of that worked, she showed up at my office building, causing such a scene in the lobby that security had to escort her out. The story made it into the local gossip blogs - ""Local Woman Claims Sister Stole Inheritance"" - complete with Melissa's carefully crafted victim narrative and photos of her holding baby Sophie.

I didn't respond to any of it. I'd learned that engaging with Melissa's drama only fed it, and I was done being fuel for her chaos.

But I wasn't prepared for her to show up at my apartment that Tuesday night, eight months pregnant with her second child - apparently she'd reconnected with David just long enough for one more catastrophic decision - looking like she'd been living in her car.

Which, as it turned out, she had been.

""I have nowhere else to go,"" she said, still standing on my doorstep, still clutching that phone like it might save her. ""Mom and Dad won't even take my calls. David's gone again. I lost my job, lost my apartment. Please, I know we have history, but I'm your sister.""

I looked at her - really looked at her - for the first time in years. The designer dress was wrinkled and stained. Her perfect manicure was chipped. The confident smile that had charmed her way through life was nowhere to be seen. This was Melissa stripped of all the advantages that had carried her through three decades of bad decisions, finally facing the consequences of her choices.

Part of me wanted to invite her in, to feed her, to let her sleep on my couch, to prove that I was the bigger person I'd always been expected to be. But a stronger part of me - the part that had built a business, survived a devastating betrayal, and learned my own worth - recognized this moment for what it was.

Not a crisis requiring my rescue, but a choice about who I wanted to be.

""I'm sorry you're in this situation,"" I said, and I meant it. ""But this isn't my responsibility to fix.""

""What about Sophie?"" she asked, desperate now. ""What about the baby? They're innocent in all this.""

""You're right, they are innocent. Which is why you need to make better choices for them. There are resources - shelters, assistance programs, support systems for single mothers. I can give you some phone numbers.""

""I don't want phone numbers!"" she screamed. ""I want help from my sister! I want what you got from Mom and Dad!""

""What I got,"" I said quietly, ""was thirty-seven years of being invisible, dismissed, and taken for granted. What I built came from deciding that wasn't enough anymore.""

I stepped back and began to close the door.

""You're heartless,"" she spat. ""You always were. That's why David came to me in the first place - because you're cold and selfish and - ""

I closed the door gently but firmly, turned the deadbolt, and walked back to my living room where I poured myself a glass of wine and sat down to think.

Was I heartless? Maybe. But I'd learned there was a difference between being heartless and having boundaries, between being selfish and practicing self-care. I'd spent most of my life absorbing other people's chaos, and I was done.

The next morning, I called my parents to let them know about Melissa's visit. They weren't surprised - apparently she'd tried them first, camping out in their driveway until they'd threatened to call the police.

""We're worried about the children,"" Mom said. ""But we can't keep enabling her. She needs to face the consequences of her choices.""

It was strange, hearing my mother echo the same conclusion I'd reached. For the first time in our relationship, we were on the same side.

Six months later, I was sitting in a conference room in downtown Seattle, signing papers to establish the Sarah Matthews Foundation for Women's Entrepreneurship. The foundation would provide grants, mentoring, and resources for women starting their own businesses, particularly those who'd faced significant personal or professional setbacks.

I thought about calling it the ""Second Chances Foundation,"" but that felt too much like it was about other people's mistakes rather than women's potential. This wasn't about redemption - it was about recognition. Recognition that women often have to rebuild their lives from scratch, and that they deserve support when they choose to bet on themselves.

The foundation's first major event was a luncheon featuring successful female entrepreneurs sharing their stories. I was invited to be the keynote speaker, and as I stood at the podium looking out at two hundred women who'd overcome their own challenges to build something meaningful, I felt a sense of purpose I'd never experienced before.

""Some of you know my story,"" I began. ""How I went from being the overlooked daughter to building a multimillion-dollar consulting firm. But what you might not know is that my real success didn't come from the business growth or the financial recognition or even the family inheritance that changed my life.""

I paused, thinking about the journey that had brought me to this moment.

""My real success came from learning that I didn't need anyone else's permission to value myself. It came from understanding that being the 'steady one' wasn't a consolation prize - it was actually a superpower. And it came from realizing that sometimes, the most radical thing you can do is simply refuse to accept less than you deserve.""

The standing ovation that followed wasn't just applause - it was recognition from women who understood exactly what I meant.

That evening, I drove to my new house in the hills overlooking the city. It wasn't a mansion - I wasn't interested in showing off - but it was mine, every square foot of it, from the home office where I still took client calls to the guest room that was always ready for friends who valued our friendship rather than what I could do for them.

I poured myself a glass of wine and walked out to the balcony where I could see the city lights stretching out below me. Somewhere out there, Melissa was presumably rebuilding her life, hopefully making better choices for herself and her children. I genuinely hoped she was, though I no longer felt responsible for ensuring it.

My phone buzzed with a text from my assistant reminding me about tomorrow's board meeting for a nonprofit I'd joined, followed by another message from my parents suggesting dinner this weekend, and a third from James, the architect I'd been dating for six months, asking if I wanted to grab breakfast before his flight to Portland.

Simple messages about a life filled with purpose, healthy relationships, and mutual respect. Nothing dramatic, nothing crisis-driven, nothing requiring me to sacrifice my own well-being for someone else's comfort.

As I sat there watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of gold and pink, I thought about that night Melissa had shown up at my door, desperate and broken, asking for help. I'd spent months wondering if I'd made the right choice, if I'd been too harsh, if family loyalty should have trumped everything else.

But sitting there in the peace I'd built for myself, surrounded by the life I'd created through my own choices and efforts, I knew I'd made the only decision that honored who I'd become.

Sometimes, the most powerful revenge isn't plotting someone else's downfall. Sometimes it's simply refusing to let their chaos define your worth. Sometimes it's building a life so fulfilling that their opinion of you becomes irrelevant.

And sometimes, walking away is the most powerful thing you can do.

1lpj9sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1lpj9sv/when_does_caffeine_use_turn_sinful/,When does caffeine use turn sinful?,"Hello there. I am a 21 year old male who started drinking coffee when I was 15. I have quite an addictive personality, and throughout high school and college I started doing other drugs like nicotine, marijuana, alcohol, and others, and formed addictive habits with these substances. Around sophomore year of college is the first time in my life where I looked at my actions and desired to change. This is when my spiritual journey towards God began. Over these past two years, I have grown in my relationship with Christ/ God and with that came a desire for holiness that has allowed me to quit nicotine (I still smoke cigars), alcohol (I still drink, just not too excess), and weed. 

With that being said, I still drink coffee nearly every day. I love it. I love the taste of it, I love the way that it makes me feel, and I love the structure and ritual it provides to my mornings. However, it is still a drug, and a drug that I am physically and mentally addicted to. I don't understand why it's so widely accepted as a non-sinful practice. I understand that what is sinful for me may not be sinful for you, and I generally know the moral theology on drugs and substance use, but I haven't really found a good enough answer as to why daily recreational caffeine use is not sinful. 

Either way, I am going to take a caffeine detox for the month of July and see how I feel after. I am definitely not going to give up coffee forever but I think that I will need stronger theological or biological reasons to not just start daily use after the detox. I know that it's going to be very challenging which is why I am writing this post. It would help me if someone could justify putting an end to habitual caffeine use (caffeine addiction) or just help me to see where my views are wrong or perhaps scrupulous.

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck to play on the go or in loving room tv.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",2,1751419288.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Hey there üëã

I‚Äôm a laid-back, outdoorsy type from Michigan who appreciates good conversation, dark humor, and the kind of company that just clicks. I‚Äôm 5'10"", athletic build, green eyes, brown hair, and I work a hybrid job that gives me a lot of flexibility.

During the week, I‚Äôm all about cozy nights with trash TV, sports, or a good book. But on weekends, I come alive‚Äîcamping, hiking, biking, beach glass hunting, grilling, checking out a new brewery or local spot, you name it.

I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone who‚Äôs consistent, witty, and maybe just as sarcastic as I am. Someone who values connection over chaos, and isn't afraid to be real. Whether it‚Äôs a fun chat that turns into a friendship, or something that builds naturally over time‚ÄîI‚Äôm open to seeing where things go.

No pressure, no expectations‚Äîjust looking for someone cool to talk to and vibe with. Bonus points if you love cuddles, coffee, and don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously.

Shoot me a message if this sounds like your kind of energy.

It‚Äôll be my first time with my vegetarian parents and sister, and I‚Äôm trying to balance adventure and relaxation. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got planned:

Day 1
Arrive in San Jose and get picked up by Hotel El Silencio del Campo in La Fortuna in the afternoon. Planning to have dinner at the hotel and just relax after the travel day.

Day 2
Doing a full-day Viator tour that includes Arenal Volcano, La Fortuna Waterfall, and hot springs. Hoping to wind down again with dinner and chill time afterward.

Day 3
Still deciding between a Rio Celeste day trip or Sky Adventures (tram + hanging bridges). Any recommendations between those two?

Day 4
Morning coffee and chocolate tour (booked through Viator), then heading to San Jos√© and checking into a hotel there. Thinking about doing some nightlife or the Hacienda Trails walking area in the evening and I open to suggestions!

Day 5
Grabbing breakfast, walking through downtown San Jos√© for a bit, then heading out.

‚∏ª

If anyone has thoughts on:
	‚Ä¢	Rio Celeste vs Sky Adventures?
	‚Ä¢	Where to eat in La Fortuna or San Jos√©?
	‚Ä¢	Hidden gems or must-dos near Arenal or downtown San Jos√©?

Would love any recs! Thanks! üôèüèΩ",1,1751419072.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False

Hey, I like talking about philosophy, why we behave as we do, what the f is happening, and subjects that go pretty deep. I can talk about anything. I‚Äôm existential by nature and like to figure things out.. maybe we can do it together. I‚Äôm having trouble finding people like me who are having a hard time and are alone, and I have no one to go through this with, but want to figure their problems out, not avoid them. I‚Äôm looking for conversations where people want to face their fears, but they just don‚Äôt know how to. I‚Äôve done this myself so I know how to and I wanna help others.

I‚Äôm not really a good friend to talk about the weather with, I have problems and I‚Äôm looking for other people who have problems so that we can travel this path together. I‚Äôm not looking to perpetuate a rainbow, coffee world, I‚Äôm looking for people who like to pioneer a new narrative For themselves, like I do.

I want to meet people where they are and help them get through the hard times that they‚Äôre going through because I‚Äôve been there. And every time I post to a friendship community it says that I‚Äôm defeating the purpose of the sub so I have to do it here on my own page. Thank you for reading.

I like to be goofy and I like to laugh. I have things and thoughts in my life that I wanna talk through and heal from, I‚Äôve accepted the fact that I may never have a partner in my life, but I‚Äôm looking for people to travel this road with. This lonely, depressing and scary road with. I can‚Äôt seem to find people of like mid who want to break out of their narrative and forge a new one.

I‚Äôm not a Fairweather friend, I want to talk about the difficulties that we go through in our lives and share how we can overcome it and discover ourselves -who we are. I‚Äôm not looking to perpetuate a rainbow coffee world, if you get what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm looking for the hard times and the good times and the lonely times and people that can go through this with me as I go through it with them.

I am a stable strong save female presence, and I value myself. I‚Äôm not looking for romance, but I am looking for heartfelt connection.

Please feel free to DM me and investigate me (videos) to see what I‚Äôm about if you like - or just strike up a conversation. Thank you so much. ",1,1751419048.0,u_Emminoonaimnida,0,1.0,False

I had very mild flushing for most of my life but I‚Äôve always just thought it was because I was Irish and it was all hereditary and some people get super red after sweating etc blah blah blah 

Back in October I started to get these red spots right above my nose where my glasses would rest, and then red spots on my cheeks. Thought it was my glasses, or acne but nothing really worked to get rid of it. Days would go on and the red spots turned into red bumps- still just a few, thinking it was still acne caused by my horrible eating habits (cheek acne equal digestive I have read? Idk) 

Then one day both of my cheeks were super inflamed and I panicked and I thought it was fungal. So I used that nizoral shampoo as a face mask. For some reason it helped and I‚Äôm like wow I am my own doctor. Then it flared again the next week and I used the shampoo and this time it MESSED my skin up. Thinking it was a skin barrier thing I stuck with moisturizer. Then I used this glycerin rose water spray and I was completed screwed from there. I woke up with the butterfly rash thinking it was lupus because there was no way rosacea was this bad (little did I know) so the derm prescribed me an anti fungal and doxycycline. Doxy def helped me out and I was clear for about a month. 

Months later I kept getting minor flare ups and after seeing another doc it was the doxy that helped and not fungal so I kept taking the doxy. 

Fast forward to about a month ago was the last time I took doxycycline because I just needed to figure out what was triggering my flare ups. I cut out hot coffee, I cut out the Mayno Korean foam cleanser, and I drink Trader Joe‚Äôs turmeric and ginger tea every night (helps with inflammation) I drink ginger carrot and turmeric juice in the morning (Knudsen brand) and so far so good. 

I brought iced coffee back into my life so it‚Äôs probably not the caffeine and maybe it was the hot coffee? I still don‚Äôt know but I might have to stay away from hot coffee. And that‚Äôs fine idc. 

I use the prequel glycerin cleanser so it‚Äôs super gentle and then use Vanicream moisturizer after. I don‚Äôt do any acids unless I need to exfoliate which is rare since my skin is sooooo sensitive. So I use the first aid glycolic and lactic acid pads but I don‚Äôt use them on my cheeks. 

I‚Äôm just rambling on now but I‚Äôm staying hopeful and doing everything I can to figure out what I can and cannot enjoy. I hope someone else can benefit from this even if it‚Äôs just tea at night ü´∂üèº",2,1751418984.0,Rosacea,0,0.75,False
