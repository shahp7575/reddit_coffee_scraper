**Odds Breakdown: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (But They Do Tease)**  
The books are leaning hard on Madison Keys, the sixth seed, to advance to the Canadian Open semifinals. Her H2H odds sit around **-165** (implied probability: \~62%), while Tauson, the 19th seed, is a **+220** underdog (\~31%). The spread favors Keys by **2.5 games**, and the total games line hovers at **21.5-22**, with the over priced slightly lower. Translation? Bookmakers expect a competitive but ultimately one-sided affair‚Äîunless Tauson‚Äôs recent magic against Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek was just a fluke (which, in sports, it rarely is).

**News Digest: Keys Survives, Tauson Thrills**  
Clara Tauson is riding a wave of confidence after her *unreal* (as she put it) upset over second-seeded ≈öwiƒÖtek. The Danish teen avenged a Wimbledon loss with a masterclass in poise, winning a tiebreak 7-1 and closing out the match 6-3. Her journey? A blend of ‚Äúhard work‚Äù and ‚Äúgrowing confidence‚Äù‚Äîcode for ‚Äúthis kid is a menace to anyone wearing a rankings badge.‚Äù

Madison Keys, meanwhile, had to dig out of a deep hole to beat Karolina Muchova. Down a set and facing **two match points**, Keys summoned the sports equivalent of a Hollywood montage‚Äîsweaty close-ups, dramatic sighs, and a third-set rally that would make a tennis ball weep. Her victory? A 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 thriller. Keys‚Äô resilience is as reliable as a coffee machine in the morning: You know it‚Äôll power you through, even if it occasionally burns your tongue.

**Humorous Spin: Plot Twists and Danish Pastries**  
Let‚Äôs be real: Tauson‚Äôs win over ≈öwiƒÖtek was the tennis equivalent of a underdo

1mhejq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1mhejq8/should_you_buy_the_best_ultrabook_laptop_hp_14/,Should You Buy the Best Ultrabook Laptop HP 14 for School or Work,"The HP 14 Ultrabook instantly caught my attention, especially with its ""Back to School Limited Edition"" tagline. As someone who juggles work, occasional gaming, and endless video calls, I was curious to see whether this laptop could handle daily demands with ease. Featuring an Intel quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM, and a whopping 1.6TB of total storage, the specifications alone seemed promising for productivity and multitasking. After putting it through its paces, I have quite a few impressions‚Äîsome that shine, and a few that don‚Äôt.

**Design That Balances Style and Functionality**  
The HP 14 Ultrabook feels like a high-end device, thanks to its slim profile and silver finish. Weighing just about 3.24 pounds, it doesn‚Äôt weigh me down whether I‚Äôm moving it around the house or packing it for a work trip. The 0.71-inch thickness is sleek enough to rival premium ultrabooks I‚Äôve handled before, making it easy to slip into any backpack or tote. The silver coating not only looks modern but seems resistant to fingerprints and smudges‚Äîa big win for someone who hates constantly wiping down their devices. The port selection is solid as well, featuring USB-C and HDMI options, so I didn‚Äôt have to struggle with adapters. That said, the thin bezels around the display add more to its overall aesthetic appeal.  

**Effortless Multitasking with Powerful Hardware**  
Under the hood, the Intel quad-core CPU paired with 16GB of RAM ensures that this laptop doesn‚Äôt buckle under pressure. I ran several programs simultaneously including Excel, Chrome with what feels like 20 tabs, and Photoshop, and there wasn‚Äôt even a stutter. Microsoft 365 comes pre-loaded in this limited edition, which made it easier to dive into work without worrying about additional costs for essential software. The experience of switching between apps felt buttery smooth, and for students or professionals managing heavy workloads, it is undeniably capable.

**Battery That Goes the Distance**  
Battery life is one of those features I rarely feel impressed by, but the HP Ultrabook managed to surprise me. With up to 11.5 hours of battery life, I found myself working the entire day without constantly searching for an outlet. Streaming Netflix, tackling Zoom calls, and occasional YouTube sessions‚ÄîI squeezed nearly an entire day without hitting rock bottom. For travelers or students who spend long hours on campus, this kind of endurance is a lifesaver.

**Impressive Storage Options for Every Need**  
When I saw the ""1.6TB storage"" in the specs, I thought it was a typo. But no, the laptop offers 128GB onboard storage, and it comes with a free 512GB portable SSD and an additional 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage. As someone who hoards high-resolution photos, videos, and documents, I never felt limited by space. The external SSD is super handy for quick file access when I need to switch between devices, and the OneDrive integration makes it perfect for backing up everything securely. It‚Äôs almost like a Swiss Army knife of storage solutions.

**Crystal-Clear Video Calls for the New Normal**  
Since remote meetings and virtual coffee hours have become a regular part of life, I need a device that handles video calls with clarity. The HP True Vision HD camera doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Combined with dual array microphones, my colleagues said my visuals were crisp, and my voice was free of distortion. Whether chatting with friends or stuck in a three-hour Zoom meeting, everything ran smoothly without the ‚Äúcan you hear me?‚Äù loop.

**Good Points**  
- Lightweight and portable; perfect for commuting.  
- Seamless multitasking with Intel quad-core CPU and 16GB RAM.  
- Extensive storage options: onboard, portable, and cloud-based.  
- Sleek and modern silver design.  
- Long battery life for day-to-day use.

**Shortcomings**  
- The display, while decent, doesn‚Äôt have particularly vibrant colors. It‚Äôs sufficient for everyday work but falls short for photo editing or cinematic viewing.  
- Audio quality could be punchier. While it‚Äôs fine for calls or basic music playback, I found it lacking depth.  
- Would‚Äôve loved a backlit keyboard‚Äîyou miss it when working in low-light conditions.

**Other Options**  
Looking at competitors, Dell‚Äôs XPS line comes to mind. While Dell laptops might provide slightly more vibrant screens and premium build quality, the value proposition of the HP 14 Ultrabook becomes evident when considering the storage and software bundle. Lenovo‚Äôs IdeaPad Slim series is a close contender, offering comparable weight and battery life but tends to fall behind in raw performance and multitasking capability. If portability and sheer storage flexibility are top priorities, the HP Ultrabook holds its own quite well.

**Smart Spending**  
While prices fluctuate, the combination of features versus cost on this device is a significant win. Including Microsoft 365 and the additional 512GB SSD as part of the deal makes it an even more attractive package. For students, professionals, or anyone who needs reliable and portable performance, the investment is justified. Sure, it might lack in certain areas like display vibrancy, but for the price, you‚Äôre getting a dependable device without paying a premium.

1mhefts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mhefts/fighting_if_you_can_call_it_that/,Fighting (If you can call it that),"My wife and I don‚Äôt really argue in the traditional sense. When she‚Äôs upset, she tends to shut down emotionally and ignore me for long stretches of time. eventually things just return to ""normal,"" but nothing really gets resolved.

This most recent instance started on Friday. I came home from work after a rough night of sleep (for both of us), and my dad who lives nearby and has been helping with our foundation work was already there. We finished up around 8:00 PM, and by that time, my wife had already gone to bed.

Saturday morning, I had a few meetings. When I got back, I wanted to spend time together as a family and run some errands. I offered to take my wife and our son into town with me. I offered to buy her a coffee, took our son to ride the train at the mall, and even grabbed a pizza for us on the way home. Throughout all of it, my wife was distant cold responses, little affection, and every suggestion I made felt like a point of resistance.

Later that night, after we put our son to bed, I finally asked her to talk with me just to tell me what was going on. She told me she felt unappreciated. That she does so much for the house, for me, for our family, and that I don‚Äôt give her breaks or acknowledge her efforts. And she‚Äôs right she does a lot. She packs my lunch, pours my coffee, has dinner ready most nights. I told her I truly appreciate those things and that I‚Äôd make a better effort to express that more consistently.

But I also reminded her of that same day I had tried to take things off her plate, bought her coffee, picked up dinner, made a point to spend time with our son. I even tried to include her in a relaxing family outing.

She brought up the work she had done in the attic organizing, purging, sorting things out and that I hadn‚Äôt shown much enthusiasm when I went to look. I tried to explain that I had gone up to see it almost immediately after she told me about it. If I came across as underwhelmed, I apologized. I‚Äôve been running on fumes lately and maybe didn‚Äôt give the reaction she was hoping for.

I also mentioned how I had done a big clean-out in the basement the week before something I asked her twice to come see. She didn‚Äôt go look until two or three days later. That‚Äôs why I said it felt a bit hypocritical.

She also said it upset her that I got straight to work on Friday night because my dad was there. From my perspective, it just made sense to use the help while I had it especially since the work was already underway.

Since then, she‚Äôs withdrawn completely spending all day Sunday in our bedroom, barely speaking. I handled everything around the house: took our son to the playground, spent time with him, managed his nap, gave her space, and did all the daily tasks she normally handles. I didn‚Äôt mind it gave me extra time with my son, and I was genuinely trying to give her a break.

This morning, as I was leaving for work, she was out walking with our son. I slowed down to say goodbye, told him I‚Äôd be home after work, and said goodbye to her too. She just stared at me. didn‚Äôt say a word. Just looked at me.

It's frustrating because I genuinely feel like I do a whole lot to ensure that she feels valued. And doesn't seem to be enough for her. 
It's very frustrating because she doesn't want to find a solution to the issue. And she wants to be mad for a couple days and then pretend like nothing happened. She doesn't want solutions.

I'm probably not going to try and find peace with her like I typically do. I'm going to let her throw her fit until she comes to me. I've already tried going to her once to clear the air. It's her turn. ",1,1754316456.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1mhed6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mhed6t/i_may_be_getting_the_love_of_my_life_back/,I may be getting the love of my life back.,"Three years ago I was in a relationship I had no idea would keep me up at nights until now. Poor communication from my side, some shitty decisions and in general being a dipshit 21 year old led to me losing her. The break up, whilst supposedly mutual, could have been avoided had I had a pair and fought it harder.
We stopped talking, I texted her on her birthday 2 years ago and didn't speak again. 
Didn't text her last year because I wanted to ignore this pain I was feeling inside me. Maybe I thought that ""deleting"" her from my life would help me move on. I spent the last year regretting that.
This year I didn't repear my stupid choices. I texted her, we caught up, she told me she'd recently broken up from a relationship of almost 3 years. We reminisced a little, I apologized for 2 days straight, cried my eyes out, tried to make amends.
We've been talking almost daily for the past weeks and oh god i've missed her. Her voice is so beautiful. She's become so much more beautiful, something I had no idea was possible.
She said we should grab a coffee when she's back in town and I'm back from sailing.
I'm trying to keep a clear head and not read into it that much because I don't want to break my heart any more than I've already broken it, but I just can't stop thinking about us getting back together. I love her and never stopped loving her one second. Never stopped thinking about her, never stopped caring. I spent so many nights praying that our paths somehow cross again and I get a second chance at a relationship that had the potential to be my last relationship.
Next month if all goes well we'll go out for that coffee. I have 20 more days in this floating hell and I can finally go back and fix what I broke three years ago by being stupid.
I want her more than she knows.
And i'm trying so hard to not scare her away but it's so damn hard to keep three years of emotions at bay. Three years of so many unheard apologies, so much praying, so much crying, so many mornings wishing I could stay in the dreams I have of us still being together.
I'm tired. 
I just want the love of my life back.
Please manifest for me. I wish everyone had a person in their lives with so much meaning. A person who you could throw everything away and move to the other side of the country for, just to be by their side.

1mhecik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1mhecik/co_postoffer_aboutface_thoughts/,[CO] Post-Offer About-Face (thoughts?),"Looking for any reactions or thoughts:

I recently took a position as HRD w a family run co. about 300 miles away, and moved my family of seven to their location. LSS, the culture at the exec/admin level was sort of a sophomoric cult. CEO got the reigns from his dad, and all his buds got in-clique-only perks, like, not working, drifting in at noon, 3-hour coffees, inflated pay/bonuses, and so on, some of it quite illegal in CO. Needless to say, there was a ton of animosity among the rank and file who worked their butts off in a very laborious industry, and had a front row seat to the above nepotistic shenanigans.

Having worked for family cos. before, I was very careful to tiptoe my way into the mix. Alas, apparently even things like asking everyone in HR to post a weekly schedule by their door was a threat to the status quo, and after five short months I was shown the door. They gave me some BS about ""not bonding with the leadership team"" and ""being a bad fit."" By the end, I could sense many of the jet set didn't like me, maybe because I drove a minivan, or didn't like single malt scotch, or maybe because my jacket wasn't Patagonia or this year's color. But mostly, probably, because I was a straight HRD with crazy notions like communicating and being accountable. I washed my hands and walked away into unemployment.

Anyway, flash forward 3 months and I landed what I thought was the perfect job at last. CO is at-will, so no contracts, but offer letter was issued and signed, I came in and did my I9, the packet, all good. Then, while waiting for a needed industry-specific license to come through bf I could start, all of the sudden the outgoing HRD (who was all smiles before) turned on me OOTB, and zeroed in on how I said not to contact the previous job. I quickly explained that I wanted to go over what happened there first, did so, and gave her permission to contact my reference there.

When she finally circled back to me, she said my reference (my mentor there and a decent guy who only sipped the Kool-Aid) gave me a so-so, and forwarded her to one of the laxidasical reports I described above. This seemed odd to me. She then pulled my offer and said good luck.

When I reached out to my reference, he said he did NOT forward her to the report, but shared that the hiring HRD was gal pals with that report and a bunch of others from the in-crowd back there, and that she had actually been asking them all about me days before anyone contacted him and before I gave her permission and his name.

So there's the lie about how she got her 411, on top of the ugly rescind after her grapevine bashed me unfairly. 

Is this just tough s++t or do I have some recourse here? I filed a complaint with her GM, just for the record, and I'm moving on lord knows, but curious what Reddit thinks, and typing this all out was cheaper than therapy, and helps keep me out of prison. I get networking, but isn't this just a little, IDK, dirty? TIA!",2,1754316242.0,AskHR,1,1.0,False

I got into coffee very recently. I'm currently working with a 2 cup bialetti and a timemore C3s grinder. I haven't tried a lot of brands as of yet. I've purchased BT silver Oak blend and 100% Arabica from cothas. 
I usually grind my beans between 10-13 clicks. I use pre heated water in the pot. The problem is the coffee tastes very bad. It tastes somewhere between extremely bitter to extremely sour. I have no clue how to fix it nor how I can tweak the process to make coffee that tastes better, let alone give off the tasting notes mentioned. I've watched a few videos on how to help it, but it has not done me much good.

I‚Äôm falling for someone who‚Äôs been frequently hooking up, and I don‚Äôt know if I should still feel things for him. 

I (M25) have been talking to my online (gaming) friend (M25) for 2 years na. I just recently moved to Manila for work and had the opportunity to meet him. We met up in Greenhills for a coffee and talked about things. He was so sweet and caring in person pala talaga. He moved me to the inner side of the sidewalk when we‚Äôre walking, he held my hands when crossing the road, etc. some things a gentleman would do. 

While we were at Starbucks, he held my hand and told me na dating me crossed his mind before, and tbh, naisip ko na rin siya before pero I shrugged it off because of how it was impossible to date when not in proximity of each other. He asked kung what if we try dating each other. I told him na I can‚Äôt atm because I have to focus sa career for now at may kasituationship siya. Plus, I know he‚Äôs a Grindr hook-up person kasi he‚Äôd send me pics of grindr profiles and sogo pics (like every other day). 

Nung nakauwi na ako, I really can‚Äôt get what happened out of my mind (kahit ngayon pa lol it‚Äôs been more than a week). Irdk kung ano nararamdaman ko ngayon huabshdhh i want his attention, and i want to be with him. I really enjoy his company online and IRL. Kaso he enjoys hooking up talaga huhu he just sent me a pic of a grindr profile and his mirror selfie sa SoGo like 20 mins ago. parang that should be me ang tema hahahahuhu

Like, you blink and suddenly you‚Äôre buying credits for robots to do your personal gifting. Confession: I legit thought AI gift cards were for *actual* artificial intelligences at first‚Ä¶ Like, is there a little robot somewhere using those credits to buy itself fancier code? üòÖ

But seriously, I just got offered one at check-out, and now I‚Äôm obsessed. Instead of picking a standard coffee card or grabbing generic Amazon credit, you give someone a portal to an algorithmic genie. What even ARE the possibilities?

- Can you use an AI gift card at https://goodnovel.org/? (Not kidding, imagine unlimited sassy novel recommendations based on secret preferences you never reveal!)

- Will the card let you use word count, drawing, playlist curation, and recipe generation, all at once?
- Do you need to know how to *talk* to the AI, or is there a ‚Äúgift card for dummies‚Äù manual attached?
- What if you buy a $50 card and your friend only wants one two-sentence summary of their love life in the style of Jane Austen?

I kinda love the chaos here.

Because it means the gift you give can be totally unique. Your bookworm cousin gets instantly customized reading recs from https://goodnovel.org/, while your foodie aunt gets a never-ending personal meal plan. And hey, someone might even use theirs for a bespoke meme generator‚Äîsuddenly, you‚Äôre the best gift-giver in the family group chat.

But here‚Äôs what also kind of confuses me:

- Does *every* AI site accept these, or is it more like being stuck with a restaurant gift card you‚Äôll never use because it‚Äôs 400 miles away?
- How does the gift card even work? Is it a code you email, a printout you hand over, or some digital blockchain-voodoo?
- Do AI companies even know how weird this is, or are they just laughing all the way to the bank at our excitement and confusion?

I tried poking around, and so far the biggest selling point I see is customization. Like, *maximum personalization*, minimum burden. You don‚Äôt need to know your recipient‚Äôs favorite color, author, or spirit animal. You just send them a digital key, and they decide what kind of AI magic to unleash.

https://goodnovel.org/ is totally my test case. Because if I receive an AI card, I know exactly what I want‚Äîan endless stream of new books tailored by a robot that actually knows what I like, no pretenses.

The future of gifting is both dazzling and a little bit disorienting. Suddenly, what you‚Äôre giving isn‚Äôt a thing, or a number on a card‚Ä¶but access to possibility.

So, would you want an AI gift card? Or is it just another ‚Äúlast-minute‚Äù click-to-pretend-you-care move? And what‚Äôs the most surprising or brilliant way you can think to use one?

We recently completed a week long sit.The pet was lovely, the house was fine, and everything went smoothly on the care front.

Before the sit, we offered to arrive the night before to meet the dog and have a proper handover, especially since the homeowners had hosted previous sitters overnight. This time, they declined, saying they had friends staying. We respected that, even though no friends were there when we arrived the next morning.

Instead, they suggested we stay at the town‚Äôs only hotel/resort, which they claimed some previous sitters had used. We looked it up, it was $500 a night, way out of our budget. Honestly, hard to believe any sitters actually went for that, but maybe we‚Äôre missing something?

So we booked a more affordable hotel 30 minutes away at our own expense and they asked us to arrive the next morning at 8:30am sharp because they had to leave by 9. We skipped our hotel breakfast and made the early drive.

But when we arrived, they took their time ‚Äî went out for coffee and groceries and didn‚Äôt actually leave until almost 11. And the whole vibe was‚Ä¶ cold. Not unfriendly exactly, but we didn‚Äôt feel welcome. No offer of a glass of water, no warmth, just a very transactional handover. We‚Äôre experienced sitters and usually there‚Äôs at least some mutual hospitality, but this felt very one-sided.

We‚Äôre torn on how to handle the review. Would you knock off a star for ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù or ‚Äúoverall experience‚Äù? Or just mention it in the comments? We don‚Äôt want to be petty, but we also think future sitters should know what to expect. The homeowners have 20+ 5 stars reviews.

Not the kind of late that signals urgency, but late the way money waits to grieve until the media has gone. A glossy house behind a coded gate. The kind of home where people bring casseroles in silence and press lightly on the small of your back.

The mother answered the door in silk. Her eyes were red, but her voice was steady. She said she hadn‚Äôt slept. That her thoughts wouldn‚Äôt stop. That she needed help before the funeral.

‚ÄúNot for him,‚Äù she clarified. ‚ÄúFor me.‚Äù

He followed her through glass halls and untouched corners, past framed vacation photos and a wine fridge humming softly in the kitchen. She talked while she walked. About therapy. About expectations. About how her surviving son didn‚Äôt understand how hard it was for her to go on.

The boy was in the living room. Seven, maybe eight. Sitting cross-legged in front of the television, watching footage of twisted metal and flashing lights‚Äîhis brother‚Äôs wreck, looped with commentary.

No one had turned it off.

He didn‚Äôt look away when the Quieter entered. Just kept watching.

The mother lingered at the threshold.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like to talk.‚Äù

The Quieter said nothing.

He stood between them, silence spreading like ink. The boy still hadn‚Äôt moved. His hands rested on his knees. One knuckle was raw, healing slow.

But his cheeks were wet.

No sobs. Just tears, steady and soundless, carving clean tracks down his face.

She shifted, impatient now. ‚ÄúYou do need touch, right? Or is it one of those non-contact versions? I just‚Ä¶ please, I need to feel something else. Anything else.‚Äù

He turned to her.

Her grief sat wrong. Not raw. Rehearsed. The sorrow she carried wasn‚Äôt for the dead. It was for the disruption. The way it bent her narrative out of shape.

He could take it. Could ease the ache she described. But he saw now what that would mean.

Quieters didn‚Äôt hollow lightly, and never by accident.

But she was asking for peace without pain. Absolution without burden. To be swept clean of something she‚Äôd never held. She ordered numbness like coffee, casual and exact. That was the kind of forgetting that deserved to be hollowed.

So he did it.

Fingertips brushing her temple, he took it all. Not just the pain, but the parts of her that held: like fruit clinging to the pit, torn free. He felt the effect immediately. Not a light being dimmed, but a door closed. A room no longer there, to hold pain or joy. Just hollow in its place.

Something bitter and metallic clawed at his tongue,

Lodged unnaturally in his throat.

She gasped. Her shoulders dropped. Relief bled across her face.

And then. Nothing.

Not calm. Not joy. Just absence.

When she looked up, her eyes caught a mirror on the wall.  
She drifted across the room, smoothing her hair.

The boy turned then. Watched her. Watched him.

He didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt wipe his face. Just stared, too knowing for his age. Like he could feel the vacancy before it reached him. Then he turned back to the screen, and something flashed across his face. Repulsion. Or relief.

The Quieter looked back at him. And for a moment, considered.

But this pain, this boy‚Äôs ache, it wasn‚Äôt the kind you take.

Some pain shapes you.

To take it would be to take him.

He stood beside the boy for a few minutes.  
Lights from the television flickered across their faces.  
He reached forward, clicked a button.  
The screen went black.  
They remained there a moment longer. Reflections mirrored in the screen.

He stepped back.  
And left.

1mhe3lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mhe3lb/the_house_on_the_bayou_part_1/,The House on the Bayou (Part 1),"This is my first time telling this to anyone except for my therapist. She actually suggested I share what I'm about to tell you as part of my therapy. 
It's a pretty long story, but I have to get it out. More people need to know. I can't carry this alone anymore. 


My name is Oscar. This happened 8 years ago when I was 17, which means I'm 25 as I'm writing this now. Well, almost anyway.
A little bit of background regarding my family and the place this all happened.
I have.. had.. two parents and a younger sister. She was just 11 years old at the time. Her name is Lucy. My father was a rather successful writer, which also meant that he traveled around the country quite a lot - he found it aided his writing to be in the actual city/town/state one of his novels took place in.  And seeing as my mom always worked from home, she decided it would be better for us as a family to join him in his travels wherever he may go, instead of waiting at home for him for months at a time.
Basically, we moved a lot. A fucking lot.
Anyone who grew up in a similar situation would understand how much it sucks. You can't really make friends at school or build solid relationships with anyone because in a little while you'll be in a whole different state again and that person would be out of your life again, just like that.
No need to say, school sucked. More for me than the kids who actually lived in whatever town or city in whatever state I found myself in during my school years. It sucks to be the new kid. It sucks even more to be the new kid for multiple times every goddamn year.
I'm just glad my little sister wasn't the same age as me. Kids are assholes but at least they were a bit kinder to her in the schools she went to. Puberty hasn't begun rotting their little brains with hormones causing them to treat their fellow students like rabbid dogs quite yet.
Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky. I won't go into the details of my years being bullied (that bit of baggage is locked up and waiting to be spilled at another therapy session) but I believe it's safe to say, it caused me to become quite depressed and introverted. 
I turned to the arts - books, poetry, films (particularly horror), music (particularly metal), video games, etc.

Anyway, it was during my junior year of high school when my dad's job forced us to move to New Orleans, Louisiana. My dad was, of course, super excited about this seeing as one of his favorite authors, William Faulkner, used to live there; his former home now turned into a well known book store: Faulkner House Books. One of my dad's dreams was writing a novel in the very same city and seeing it displayed in the windows of that legendary bookstore.

I hated that we had to move again. I had just met this beautiful girl named Angela at my high school when we were still living in Portland. We were really hitting it off. She was also kind of an introvert like me, but she made me open up a bit more. She was the first person I'd ever met who was able to do that. We shared many of the same interests and, honestly, I was starting to fall for her.. hard.
This meant that I was obviously devastated when I got home from school that Friday afternoon - with a smile on my face, not a care in the world. It was Friday for God's sake. Who wouldn't be happy coming home to the start of the weekend with a gorgeous girl on your mind.
I had just put my backpack down in my room when my mom came in. I could see on her face that what she was about to say was not going to be pleasant for me to hear. I already knew what she was going to say as well. She knew that too. She always had this slight empathetic smile on her face every time she told me.
""Your dad got a job in New Orleans. We need to start packing this weekend, dear.""

It felt like someone punched me in the throat. I didn't respond to her.  New Orleans? Really? Fucking really? What the fuck am I gonna do in New Orleans?! 2500 miles away. Christ.
How am I gonna tell Angela? Things just got good between us. I was finally able to start building a good relationship with someone.
Now it's fucked again.
Fuck my life.

I decided that it would not stop me from staying in contact with her. It fucking sucked telling her the news and I could tell she didn't take it very well. But I promised her we would never lose contact.  In fact, she's in the next room right now as I'm writing this. But more on that later.



So off we went. New Orleans. Everyone was super excited (especially my dad), but I was devastated. I hated the city before we even got there. But, honestly, if it wasn't for what happened to me there, my opinion of the city would've changed. New Orleans is beautiful. Filled with so much culture, colour, history, music, amazing food, etc.
We, of course, didn't move into the city itself. No. My dad got us an old, creepy-ass house on the outskirts of the city. You know what I'm talking about. Swampy, stinky, moldy. Too many bugs. When I protested he simply said that it was cheaper to afford than a place in the city and has much more character which might inspire him to write.
It was a double story house built in the 1800s. Meaning, it was almost entirely built from wood. Old wood. Meaning, you could hear where each person is in the house purely by listening to the creaky floorboards. 
Let me give you an idea of the layout of the house:

When you walk up to it, you're greeted with a wrap-around porch. I've actually always liked that design on a house, but this one was so old, I wouldn't dare lean on the 100 year old railing. 
When you enter through the front door, you step into the foyer where the main staircase sits directly infront of you, leading up to the 2nd story. Directly to the left is the living room, which is connected to the kitchen and the dining area a bit further back on the left side. Directly to the right is another door that leads to another rather large room, which my dad turned into his office area and lined it with some of his favorite books.
A bit farther down on the right side of the stairs, was the 1st floor bathroom. And finally on the other end of the house directly across from the front door (behind the stairs) was the back door, leading to an overgrown and rather derelict backyard with a small dilapidated wooden shed, seemingly equally as old as the house.
When you walk up the stairs you step onto a balcony on the inside that runs along the back wall of the house as well as the right and left side, forming it into a sort of U shape.
This balcony leads into the three upstairs bedrooms as well as the upstairs bathroom. 
The bathroom was in the middle as you got up the stairs, my parents' bedroom was to the right, my sister's bedroom was on the front left looking over the front yard, and mine on the back left, looking over the gross backyard. 

When we walked into the house for the first time, I almost gagged at the smell. It smelled like mold and dust, but worst of all, it smelled like something had died in there quite some time ago. I figured it was probably some swamp critter that got stuck somewhere and couldn't get out. I saw my mom wince at the smell as well. 
""Okay. Oscar, Lucy, go ahead and pick your rooms. Open some windows while you're at it. We just need some fresh air in here,"" she said with a forced smile.
Fresh air? I don't think that exists around here.

My sister and I picked out our rooms (I actually wanted the room she picked, but she's the youngest so, yeah), opened some windows, which didn't really do anything to help the smell, and then helped our parents bring the last of our stuff inside.
After everything was inside and unpacked, we settled in for our first night in our new house. Seeing as we arrived on a Thursday, I was only going to start school the next Monday. So at least I didn't have that to worry about for a few days.
The first night was uneventful, though it did feel a bit eery being in that old house at night time. Especially looking out over the backyard from my window. It felt like something was staring back at me from beyond the dim light provided by our outdated backyard porch light.

The next few days were uneventful as well. We spent them sorting out some of the finer details around the house. Pretty boring stuff.

Then came Monday. The day I've been dreading for a while. But I knew what to expect. I was all too familiar with the many eyes staring at me, like I was some sort of new and exotic animal at the zoo. I sucked it up and kept to myself as much as possible. I just tried to blend in and become my invisible, introverted self. My only escape was talking to Angela via text every chance I could get. She was genuinely interested in making sure I was coping. I assured her I was fine and that I just wished she was there with me. She turned out to be a very good distraction during my time there.

I got back into my usual routine pretty quickly. Soon the school week was over again.
I woke up Saturday morning and went down to the kitchen - the noisy wooden stairs letting my mom and sister know that I'm approaching. My mom greeted me with a smile.

""Good morning, Oscar, honey. Did you sleep well?""

""Yeah, it was okay. I haven't really been getting good rest since we got here. I guess I haven't gotten used to sleeping in this old house yet,"" I said, sitting down at the kitchen table.
Mom was finishing up some breakfast for my sister and me. 
My dad was probably in his new office. He rarely joined us for breakfast.

""Oh, just give it another few days, dear. I'm sure you'll settle in properly soon enough.""

I just nodded as I ate my breakfast. 

""Your dad and I decided to go into the city for a bit today. We want to get to know the place a little. Do you want to join us? Your sister is coming too.""

I wanted to roll my eyes. I still didn't like the place. I didn't want to be here. I wanted to go back. I had zero interest in walking around a city that I knew we were leaving again all too soon. It felt pointless. I was sick of it.

""No, I think I'll sit this one out. You guys go ahead. I want to work on some school stuff (lie).
I'll be fine. I'll see you when you get back.""

""Alright then. Just go say hi to your dad before we leave. Lucy, finish up and go get ready. We want to get going soon.""

I got up and knocked on the door to my dad's office.
""Come in,"" he shouted from inside.
I stepped inside and saw that he was busy. Not busy writing, but inspecting the walls around his office.
""Morning, dad.""

No reply.

""Morning, dad!""

He snapped out of it.

""Oh, uhm, good morning, son. Sleep well?""
He didn't even look at me. Just kept looking at the walls with an inquisitive expression on his face. 

""Looking for something, dad?""

""Yeah, I thought I heard something last night. Like a scratching sound and it sounded like it came from this room. I don't know. I just don't  want another critter getting stuck somewhere and stinking up the place again.""

We never found the origin of the first rancid stench. But it went away for the most part in a few days.

""I hear you guys are going exploring today?""

He finally turned to look at me. 
""You're not joining us?""

""No,"" I said, ""I think I'll rather stay home and work on some school stuff.""

He shrugged. ""Okay, son. I don't know how long we'll be gone. Will you be alright?""

I nodded.

""Alright then, just call us if you need anything.""

""Will do, dad.""

With that, I turned around and went to the kitchen to get some more coffee. 
Soon my parents and my sister were on their way. ""Lock the door behind us, dear,"" my mom said as they stepped outside.
The moment they left and closed the front door, something immediately felt off. Standing alone in that house for the first time felt like standing on the edge of a cliff. Like I'm way, way too close to danger.
I went back up the creaky stairs and with every step I took, it felt like eyes were boring into me. Like I was being watched from every angle. It was incredibly unsettling; goosebumps spread over my entire body.
I took a breath and decided to just chalk it up to not being used to the house yet.
""You're imagining things,"" I told myself. 

I went to my room, turned on my PlayStation and put my headphones on in an attempt to shut off the world around me for a few hours.
This plan was successful for a couple hours. But then, I heard it. Through the sound of my headphones. The unmistakable sound of the floorboards creaking. From the foyer. Like weight was pushing down on them.
Okay, maybe my parents came home earlier? 
I got up and took a look down the stairs to see if they're back.

No one.

Maybe it's just the noise of the house warming up in the sun. 

I went back to my room and continued my gaming session.
About 30 minutes later, I heard it again. Only, this time, it didn't sound like it was coming from the foyer. It sounded like it was coming from the bottom of the stairs. I took my headphones off and just sat still to listen if I could hear it again. Almost immediately. Another stair was creaking. And then another. 
I tried to hear if I could make out the sounds of my parents' voices. Nothing. Just the stairs.
It kept getting closer. Climbing the stairs slowly, one by one. And with each step it climbed, it became louder, harder. More urgent. I didn't know what to do. I knew it couldn't be my parents. They wouldn't be back until mid afternoon. Who could it be? An intruder? Was someone watching the house to see when we left so they could break in?
They weren't being very stealthy because by now the footsteps turned into stomping. Like they were slamming their heels into the wooden floorboards. I could feel it through my bed.
The footsteps came all the way up the stairs, stopped, and took a step towards my room. My door was closed (out of habit) so I couldn't see if there was someone. The footsteps slowed down but came all the way to my door and stopped.
I held my breath. My eyes fixed on my doorknob. I looked down to the gap between my door and the floor. The unmistakable shadow of two feet was visible at the bottom.
My doorknob started to rattle slightly. I felt my heart beating in my throat. It started rattling more and more and more. Becoming more violent by the second. I started hyperventilating. Sweat was starting to form on my forehead. 
""This is it,"" I thought. ""This is how I die. By the hands of an intruder, all alone in a massive old house.""
I closed my eyes. I couldn't take it anymore. The rattling doorknob was now accompanied by a deafening banging on the door. I put my hands over my ears. I was about to start screaming when suddenly it went completely quiet. So quiet, I could hear my heart beating through my laboured breaths.
I opened my eyes. Nothing. My door was still closed. No stranger in my room. No gun to my head.
For some reason this made me very angry. Was this guy just fucking with me? Did he want to scare me before taking all our shit and/or murdering me?
""Fuck this,"" I thought. 
I got up, grabbed my biggest pocket knife and went to my door. I swung it open quickly, ready to do some damage. I took one step out the door and froze.
There's nobody there. Confused, I ran down the stairs, thinking maybe he ran out when he heard me get up. 
All the windows and doors were locked. 
From the inside.

I stood still for probably five minutes, not knowing what to do.

I snapped out of it and went to the kitchen. I got a glass of water, sat down with my head in my hands.

What the actual fuck just happened? I know I didn't imagine that. I didn't just hear it, I felt it.
If it wasn't a person, then what could it have been? A ghost? I almost laughed. I don't believe in that shit. My parents raised us to be sceptic. 
I was still sitting in deep thought when I heard another sound. This time it wasn't floorboards creaking or footsteps. It was much, much worse.

What I heard could only be described as someone trying to breathe, but struggling, because they're gargling. On something thick. 

I could hear the distinct sound of someone taking a deep breath in, with a screeching sound like they're desperate for air, followed by a laboured, bubbling sound as they exhaled.

It came from somewhere behind me.

I got up from my chair, almost involuntarily. I turned and walked, slowly through the dining room, through the living room and into the foyer - the noise getting louder the closer I got. 
I turned my head to see if I could hear where it came from. It dawned on me that it came from directly infront of me - inside my dad's office. I took a step closer to the closed door. I put my ear against the door. What I heard next almost brought tears to my eyes due to sheer fear. 
Through the laboured, gargling breaths, I could hear what sounded like a whimper. Like a woman crying in pain. I don't know how long I stood there listening. I almost went inside, when it changed. The crying started turning into... laughter. 
I could feel my eyes starting to water. It just got worse. The almost rhythmic laughter started turning into a cackle. It got louder and louder until I could even hear the gargling noise anymore.
This time, I didn't fucking dare open the door. I don't know what would've been worse. Opening the door and seeing some witch cackling at me or seeing nothing at all.
Both would've been equally terrifying. So instead, I turned and ran.
I ran up the stairs, straight to my room. I locked my door and sat on my bed with my knees to my chest. I didn't put my headphones back on. I didn't do anything for the rest of the day. I just sat on my bed as quietly as possible. Listening. 
I didn't hear anything again for the rest of the time until my parents came home.
I unlocked the door for them and they hurried inside. It started raining a little while before they got home.
I asked them how their day went. We chatted for a little while in the living room. My mom asked me what I did today. I just told her that I did some school work and then played some games until they came home. 
I didn't tell them anything about what really happened. God, I don't even know if it really happened. 

The rest of the night was uneventful. We all went to bed quite early - my parents tired from walking around all day and I was exhausted from being scared shitless.

The next few days were fine. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I went to school, played some games, read a little, talked to Angela.
God, I missed her. I wondered what she would've said if I told her about what happened that day. I decided not to tell her. I don't really know why. Maybe I thought she would think I'm crazy or overexaggerating. As the days went on I tried to forget about it and decided there had to be some logical explanation for what happened. Even though I had no idea what it could've been.

Fast forward about a week. What happened next, solidified the fact that I did not imagine anything. What was happening was real.

It was a Wednesday night. I woke up lying on my side in my bed, facing my wall. It was pitch black in my room, so it had to have been in the very early morning hours. I felt that uneasy feeling again. Like someone was watching me. I slowly turned around. I almost shat myself. 
In the dark I saw that my door was open. I know I closed it before going to bed. The upstairs bathroom light was on and from the light bleeding into my room I could see someone standing next to my bed, staring directly at me. 
""Lucy?"" I asked, barely able to speak.
No answer.
I squinted my eyes, trying to make out the shape in the darkness. I switched on the lamp next to my bed.
I was right. It was my sister. But something was very off about her appearance.
And then I noticed it. Her eyes. Her eyes were completely white! No iris, no pupil. Nothing!
""Lucy! Can you hear me?! Wake up!""
Still nothing. 
But then she started moving. Not even moving really, she started shaking. Just her shoulders and her little head. Like she was nodding really fast. Going quicker and quicker until her whole body started to shake. Still not making a sound.
I didn't know what to do. By this time I sat up in my bed. Finally, I decided to try to snap her out of it. I reached out my hand to put it on her shoulder but right before I could touch her I saw.. it.
In my doorway, peeking in from the landing, I saw the silhouette of a head with long black strands of hair. This thing was being illuminated by the backlight from the bathroom so I couldn't really make out a face. But what I could see was two white, glowing eyes. Staring right at me. It was hiding the rest of its body behind the doorframe. 
Without knowing it, I placed my hand on my sister's shoulder. She stopped shaking. I forced my gaze away from the creature in my doorway to look back at her.
The moment I did, she let out a blood curdling scream. I instinctively pulled my hand away, staring at her, wide eyed. The thing in my doorway stepped fully into the frame. It was hunched over and I could almost make out a slight smile on its face. In a moment Lucy was silent again. I looked behind her and saw the thing turning around to walk away. As it did, I saw what looked like a baby in it's arms. It was a woman. She turned her head and looked at me one more time before she was gone.
""Oscar?"" Lucy spoke.
I looked at her, still in shock.
""Oscar, where am I? What happened?"" Her voice caught in her throat. She started crying.
""It's okay, Lucy. You're just in my room. I'm here."" I knelt down on the floor infront of her and hugged her as she cried into my shoulder. My eyes, staring right at my open door, making sure that woman is gone.
Soon, my mom burst into my room and flicked on the light.
""What happened?! Lucy? Are you okay, darling? I thought I heard you scream?""
She let go of me and ran into my mom's arms.
""There was a lady, mommy."" Her head now buried into my mother's neck.
""An ugly lady. She was in my room. She had a baby that couldn't cry anymore.""
My mom looked back down at me. Her eyes asking me if I could help her understand. It felt like I hadn't blinked for an hour. I opened my mouth trying to say that I don't know, but nothing came out. All I could do was shake my head.
""It was just a nightmare, sweetie. It's okay now. Mommy's got you. Let's get you back to bed.""
""No!"" Lucy almost shouted. ""I don't want to go back. Can I sleep with you and daddy tonight, please?""
""Of course, dear. Let's go.""
She turned and walked towards my door. 
""Could you close my door please, mom?""
She said nothing. Just flicked the light back off as she slowly closed my door.
The moment she left, I just started balling. I had no idea what had just happened. What the fuck was that? Who was that woman? How did she get into our house? Was she always there? Hiding somewhere all day? Why did she have a baby? Why did Lucy say the baby couldn't cry anymore?
I barely slept the rest of the night.

The next morning I was visibly tired. I almost didn't go to school, but decided to just push through. I texted Angela throughout the day and I decided to just tell her everything. I knew I wasn't imagining things and I knew she would be understanding. 
I called her later and she could tell from my voice that I was serious.
""Did you check the entire house for possible hiding spots? I mean, if you say that you're positive all the doors and windows are locked, she can't possibly get in from the outside, so she has to be inside the house the entire time.""

""I've checked every corner of the house multiple times already. There are no secret hiding places that I could find. Even my dad's office where he said he'd heard some noises. I helped him check thoroughly and we couldn't find anythjng. I'm at a loss. But I know what I saw was real. I know my sister saw the same thing.""

She didn't know what to tell me. Who would? I told her I'll let her know if anything else happens. 

Luckily, for the next couple of weeks, nothing strange really happened besides my sister getting quite frequent nightmares.

A couple of weeks later, I was having breakfast with my mom and sister on a Sunday morning. 
""Oscar, have you spoken with your dad lately?"" my mom asked me through sips of her tea.
""Uhm, kinda. Why?""
""He's been seeming a little off the past few days. Like he's withdrawn. He doesn't really speak to me much anymore. And when I try to talk to him, he seems to get distracted very quickly. I don't know what's going on with him.""

""He's probably just focusing on his writing, mom. I'm sure it'll be fine. Just give him some time. Maybe he's got a little writer's block,"" I said with a reassuring smile.
She replied with a smile but I could see the worry in her eyes.
I decided to go check up on him myself. I grabbed a cup of coffee to bring to him.
I knocked on his office door and, to no surprise, he didn't answer. I decided to just go in.
He wasn't busy writing. He wasn't even sitting at his desk. He was sitting on a chair, hunched over and facing the far left corner of the room.
""Hey, dad. I, uhh, brought you a cup of coffee. Mom said that you seemed a bit distracted lately. Wanna tell me what's up?""
Nothing. I sighed, put the coffee on his desk and was on my way out when I heard him whispering something. I stopped and turned back around.
""Dad?""
He kept whispering.
""Dad, I can't hear you, speak up. Do you need something?""
Nothing. 
I noticed he wasn't sitting still. He was swaying forwards and backwards in his chair.
I went closer, trying to make out what he was saying. I wish I didn't. 

""swing swing, left to right, 
swing swing, front to back
swing swing, hanging by my
swing swing, broken neck""

I felt ice fucking cold. Why the fuck would he say that?
""DAD!? What are you saying?!""
He kept ignoring me.
I grabbed him by the shoulder and started shaking him. 
""DAD! Answer me!""
He jolted upright in his chair and snapped around to look at me. His eyes were bloodshot and bewildered. This made me take a step back.
""Oh.. hey.. uhm.. Oscar?""
""What's going on, dad? Why were you whispering that shit to yourself?""
He looked even more confused.
""What are you talking about, son?""
""Seriously? You have no idea what you were just doing?""
His expression changed as if he was trying to recall a distant memory. 
""I was just, uhm, taking a little break from writing. I haven't been feeling.. myself lately.""
""Mom mentioned that you've been withdrawn. Do you feel sick or something? Do you need to go to the doctor?""
He forced a smile. Probably something he learned from my mom.
""Oh, no, son. That's not necessary. I'm sure I'll be fine. Maybe I just need to get some more rest. I'll try again next week,"" he said as he got up and glanced at his open laptop.
I walked with him to his room and asked him if he needed anything. He said that he just wanted to be left alone for a while. 
I was very worried. I've never seen my dad like this. He could be a serious man at times, but usually he was very easy going and quite fun to be around. 

I went downstairs to my mother who was busy doing the dishes. I told her about what had happened in my dad's office. When I told her about what he had been whispering, she actually dropped the plate she was busy drying.
We were both very concerned and decided to give it a couple of days and if he doesn't get better, we have to get him some help. This change was way too sudden, and considering the batshit crazy stuff I had experienced in that house up until that point, I wasn't taking it lightly.

Recently agreed between us that I would take a career break. I‚Äôm happy with this, I actually have a job to go to so it‚Äôs a short break‚Ä¶ more like 12 months.

During this time I have obviously been with DS rather than him being at nursery.

DP transfers around 150 a week for activities for me and DS, like soft play, lunch out etc any toys we might get while in supermarket and so on.

He covers mortgage and bills at the moment and at weekends I might get a coffee or a lunch but as I‚Äôm not earning this comes from my savings.

Whilst it was my idea to take a year off, I‚Äôve obviously done it with his agreement otherwise I couldn‚Äôt have done it. He was happy DS wouldn‚Äôt be in nursery as much, as was I.

I feel like 150 is a bit stingy and he doesn‚Äôt understand that a coffee, for example, is 4.50 at lots of places. Car parking, soft play, it all adds up! I want to suggest he sends over another 50 but I know he will make a comment like get a flask for coffee etc which just makes me feel irritated as it‚Äôs hard work being with a toddler all day! For context he‚Äôs a high earner, a little over 100k. Am I in the right here?!



Tupaas ¬∑¬†Today 13:41

u/HelpMeGetThrough¬†well today for example it‚Äôs been 12.99 for soft play, 15 for lunch and coffee, 4 parking, 3.50 ice cream. And it‚Äôs not even 2pm. I feel like I‚Äôm careful and go to cheap places, I‚Äôm not having a luxurious day out!

*kittenkipping ¬∑¬†Today 13:38*

*This must be a reverse. ¬£600 for leisure is a generous amount. Surely you dont go to places that cost every day? You go to friends / museums/ walks and the park etc some days? Or even stay home. If you go out to a place with cost 3 days a week you have ¬£50 a day to spend between you and a toddler, that‚Äôs good imo*

u/kittenkipping

yes definitely see friends etc but that might be one day a week and it‚Äôs still ice cream or a bottle of water etc so not totally free

I'm 38 and the more I read about ADHD the more I think I may have it. Hunting for a psychiatrist now but in Germany the wait times can be really really long, and it'd be nice to see if I'm even on the right track.","For most of my life I chalked up my struggles in normal daily functioning to my early life trauma. I was adopted from China to the US at 8. I attributed my lack of energy and motivation to depression caused from the adoption. I've finally worked through a lot of the trauma and realizing that there's a underlying issue, which seems to do with dopamine that has plagued me for all my life.

Not looking for diagnosis, more just community. It'd be nice to think that maybe I can get to the root of all this after all these years.

* I'd say 9-10 months of the year I am in a state of mild to moderate brain fog, complete apathy, lack of energy, lack of motivation. This has gotten worse as I've gotten older.
* I find myself constantly seeking stimulation and dopamine. I was highly addicted to video games as a kid and would play 70-80 hours/week.
* I always thought I had a weird super-power in being able to just grind in games. My friends would game but not for the 12-16 hour sessions like I would do. Now that I read, this sounds like hyper fixation. I'll get in these modes for a few months then not be interested in giving anything any attention.
* I brute forced my way through school through intelligence. Everything was super easy until college. Still to this day I don't understand how I graduated college. I had such a hard time going to class regularly, I put off all my work and studying to the last minute, every test I felt super unprepared, but I still managed. I did switch to a business degree because I found those classes I could pass easily without much attendance or studying.
* I lose complete interest in jobs and haven't held a job longer than 6 months. Most jobs I'd quit after 3 months. For 8 years now I've supported myself with my online business where I'll work in bursts as I get energy and then ignore it completely for weeks/months.
* Caffeine seems to fix all my problems for a few weeks but the effectiveness quickly diminishes, and after a while drinking coffee just makes me tired and all the benefits go away. Then I'll eventually stop drinking it and go into a real low period of brain fog/total lack of motivation.

The only thing that's kept me sane and alive is discovering vipassana meditation. I've attended a dozen 10 day silent retreats now and the practice has helped tremendously in alleviating my suffering. However it hasn't addressed the issue of simply being unmotivated/lethargic much of the time.

Exercise has also been hugely beneficial. I've now hiked 20,000 miles and done many long distance hikes(Appalachian Trail, PCT, etc.). Part of the reason is on those trails is when I feel functional, normal, and alive.

I wonder if it's dopamine related, as when you walk 12 hours a day your baseline dopamine has to be much higher than ""normal life"". Then when I finish a trail I will crash and be in a really low spot for months after.

Through diet, exercise, meditation I am able to be somewhat functional but it's still a struggle and it would be such a relief if taking something like adderall would help alleviate the brain fog/lethargy/lack of motivation.

It just feels like life shouldn't be this hard. Every day is a battle to get out of bed, exercise, meditate, stay off my phone.

1mhdwm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1mhdwm1/engine_resealhow_much_to_seat_rear_main_seal/,Engine Reseal-How Much to Seat Rear Main Seal,"Working on my EJ253 engine out of a 2010 Subaru Forester X AT SOHC and saw that it was leaking out of the rear main seal. Pulled the seal and used a seating tool from Company 23. Snugged the bolts down until the tool bottomed out per instructions and I just want to check on the opinion of those more seasoned than myself on the seal. The picture I'm attaching is to try to show  as close to a side profile as I could get.

The seal is definitely seated into the block as I read it's supposed to be, but I guess I'm asking because I don't know if the lip of the seal that is not recessed is a bad thing. In the picture, the circle at the top shows how it is recessed and (I think) seated properly, while the circle in the middle of the pic shows the lip that I just need to know if that's not good.

Do I just call it done and check for leaks when all is reinstalled? I'm resealing the whole engine while it's pulled for head gaskets and just wanting to do my due diligence before reinstallation and trying to make sure these less simple things (which are new to me) are done appropriately.

Thanks in advance for input.

For project context: I'm in the middle of a project where my 2010 Subaru Forester X AT SOHC needed head gaskets. Price at the dealer kept going up as we discussed timing components, etc. It didn't feel right when head mechanic told me he didn't like the scoring in the cylinder walls and he suggested I buy a new or remanned short block. At that point we decided to put the repair payment toward a new car and tow this one home for a project for me to work on. I've done simpler auto projects before, but this is the biggest project I've tackled. It's been fun, but a little anxiety-inducing at times.

20M How do I take it past a friendship? 19F

My friend (Ellie for this story) is a super close friend of mine through an organization at our university. We recently had our main event (a camp counselor thing) and got incredibly close. I've been feeling little things here and there, like the eye contact in group settings and nicer hugs, and we've really opened up to each other outside of this group. 

For context: this counselor group is incredibly close and tight knit. There hasn't been any romantic things for several months, and lots of people are in relationships. This is kind of a new thing for this group of people were this to happen. It isn't uncommon for this to happen in this organization as a whole, however. 

Essentially, this definitely grew into what I can only perceive as some flirtiness and definitely a lot closer to me at a post-camp party the other day. The next day, I helped get her back home and it turned into running errands, meeting my cat and getting coffee and food. She asked to meet my cat, which everyone is telling me that is a clear sign of something. 

My idea was to either tell her on the phone call she wanted to have or text her about it prior to seeing her next. I don't know if it's jumping the gun but I'm confident in what I feel and how the friendship has seemed to shift. But then again, I don't wanna misread the room.

1mhduv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mhduv4/this_savage_song_by_victoria_schwab/,This Savage Song by Victoria Schwab:,"¬†The schoolbag sagged open on the bed, spilling supplies‚Äîand the uniform was way too tight. Emily claimed that was the style, but August felt like the clothes were trying to strangle him. The Flynn Task Force outfits were flexible, designed for combat, but the Colton Academy uniform was stiff, suffocating. His shirtsleeves came to rest just above his wrist bones, and the lowest of the black tallies on his forearm‚Äînow four hundred and eighteen‚Äîshowed every time he crooked his elbow. August growled and tugged the fabric down again. He ran a comb through his hair, which didn‚Äôt really stop the black curls from falling into his pale eyes, but at least he tried.  
  
¬† He straightened and found his gaze in the mirror, but his expression stared back with a vacancy that made him shudder. On Leo, the expressionless planes of his face registered as confidence. On Ilsa, the evenness read as serenity. But August just looked lost. He‚Äôd studied Henry and Emily and everyone else he came across, from the FTF cadets to the sinners, tried to memorize the way their features lit up with excitement, twisted with anger or guilt. He spent hours in front of the mirror, trying to master the nuances and re-create those faces, while Leo looked on with his flat black stare.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting your time,‚Äù his brother would say.  
  
¬† But Leo was wrong; those hours were going to pay off. August blinked‚Äîanother natural act that felt unnatural, affected‚Äîmanaged a tiny, thoughtful crease between his brows, and recited the words he‚Äôd practiced.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy name is‚ÄîFreddie Gallagher.‚Äù There was a slight hitch before the F, as the words scratched his throat. It wasn‚Äôt a lie, not really‚Äîit was a borrowed name, just like August. He didn‚Äôt have one of his own. Henry had chosen the name August and now August chose the name Freddie, and they both belonged to him, just as neither did. That‚Äôs what he told himself, over and over and over until he believed it, because truth wasn‚Äôt the same thing as fact. It was personal. He swallowed, tried the second line, the one meant only for him. ‚ÄúI am not a . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† But his throat closed up. The words got stuck.  
  
¬† I am not a monster, that‚Äôs what he wanted to say, but he couldn‚Äôt. He hadn‚Äôt found a way to make it true.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you look handsome,‚Äù came a voice from the door.  
  
¬† August‚Äôs gaze traveled up a fraction in the mirror to see his sister, Ilsa, leaning in the doorway, wearing the barest hint of a smile. She was older than August, but she looked like a doll, her long, strawberry-blond hair pulled up in its usual messy nest, and her large blue eyes feverish, as if she hadn‚Äôt slept (she rarely did).  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHandsome,‚Äù she said, pushing off the door, ‚Äúbut not happy.‚Äù Ilsa padded forward into the room, her bare feet moving effortlessly around the books, though she never looked down. ‚ÄúYou should be happy, little brother. Isn‚Äôt this what you wanted?‚Äù  
  
¬† Was it? August had always imagined himself in FTF fatigues, guarding the Seam and protecting South City. Like Leo. He heard the troops talk about his brother as if he were a god, keeping the darkness at bay with nothing but the piece of music in his head. Feared. Worshiped. August straightened his collar, which made his sleeves ride up again. He tugged them down as Ilsa snaked her arms around his shoulders. He stilled. Leo refused such contact, and August didn‚Äôt know what to make of it‚Äîtoo often touching was a part of taking‚Äîbut Ilsa had always been like this, tactile, and he reached up and touched her arm.  
  
¬† Where his skin was marked with short black lines, hers was covered in stars. A whole sky‚Äôs worth, or so he thought. August had never seen more than a handful of real stars on nights when the grid went down. But he‚Äôd heard about places where the city lights didn‚Äôt reach, where there were so many stars you could see by them, even on a moonless night.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dreaming,‚Äù said Ilsa in her singsong way. She rested her chin on top of his shoulder, and squinted. ‚ÄúWhat is that in your eyes?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat speck. Right there. Is it fear?‚Äù  
  
¬† He found her gaze in the mirror. ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he admitted. He hadn‚Äôt set foot in a school, not since the day of his catalyst, and nerves rang like bells behind his ribs. But there was something else, too, a strange excitement at the idea of playing normal, and every time he tried to untangle how he felt, he just ended up in knots.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre setting you free,‚Äù said Ilsa. She spun him around and leaned in until her face was barely an inch from his. Mint. She always smelled like mint. ‚ÄúBe happy, little brother.‚Äù But then the joy fell out of her voice, and her blue eyes darkened, sliding from noon blue to twilight without a blink between. ‚ÄúAnd be careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† August managed a ghost of a smile for her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always careful, Ilsa.‚Äù  
  
¬† But she didn‚Äôt seem to hear. She was shaking her head now, a slow, side-to-side motion that didn‚Äôt stop when it should. Ilsa got tangled up so easily, sometimes for a few moments, sometimes a few days.  
  
¬† ÔøΩ  
ÔøΩIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he said gently, trying to draw her back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe city is such a big place,‚Äù she said, her voice tight as strings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs full of holes. Don‚Äôt fall in.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ilsa hadn‚Äôt left the Flynn compound in six years. Not since the day of the truce. August didn‚Äôt know the details, not all of them, but he knew his sister stayed inside, no matter what.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll watch my step,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† Her fingers tightened on his arms. And then her eyes lightened and she was there again. ‚ÄúOf course you will,‚Äù she said, all sunshine.  
  
¬† She kissed the top of his head, and he ducked out of her arms and went to his bed, where his violin case sat open, the beautiful instrument waiting inside. August wanted to play‚Äîthe desire a hollow weight in his chest, like hunger‚Äîbut he only let himself run his fingers over the wood before snapping the case shut.  
  
¬† He checked his watch as he moved through the dark apartment. 6:15. Even here, twenty stories up, at the top of the Flynn compound, the first morning light was still buried behind the sprawl of buildings to the east.  
  
¬† In the kitchen he found a black lunch bag with a note pinned to the front:  
  
¬† Have a great first day.  
  
¬† I hope you don‚Äôt mind, I took a bite.  
  
¬† \~Em  
  
¬† When August opened the bag, he saw that everything inside, from the sandwich to the candy bar, was already half-eaten. It was a sweet gesture, really. Emily hadn‚Äôt just packed him a lunch. She‚Äôd packed an excuse. If anyone bothered to ask, he could say he‚Äôd already eaten.  
  
¬† Only a green apple sat, untouched, in the bottom of the bag.  
  
¬† The kitchen lights came on as he was shoving the lunch sack in his bag, and Henry wandered in, nursing a cup of coffee. He still looked tired. He always looked tired.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAugust,‚Äù he said with a yawn.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad. You‚Äôre up early.‚Äù  
  
¬† Henry was practically nocturnal. He had a saying‚Äîthe monsters hunt at night, and so must we‚Äîbut lately his nights had gotten even longer. August tried to imagine what he must have been like, back before the Phenomenon‚Äîbefore violence gave way to the Corsai and the Malchai and the Sunai, before the anarchy, the closed borders, the infighting, the chaos. Before Henry lost his parents, his brothers, his first wife. Before he became the Flynn the city turned to, the only Flynn it had. The creator of the FTF, and the only man willing to stand up to a glorified criminal and fight. August had seen photos, but the man in them had bright eyes and an easy smile. He looked like he belonged in a different world. A different life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBig day.‚Äù Henry yawned again. ‚ÄúI wanted to see you off.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was the truth, but not the whole truth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried,‚Äù observed August.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I am.‚Äù Henry clutched his coffee cup. ‚ÄúDo we need to go over the rules again?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù answered August, but Henry kept talking anyway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou go straight to Colton. You come straight home. If the route falls through, you call. If security‚Äôs too tight, you call. If there‚Äôs any trouble‚Äîanything at all‚Äîeven a bad feeling, August‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call.‚Äù  
  
¬† Henry‚Äôs brow creased, and August straightened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be fine.‚Äù They‚Äôd gone through the plan a hundred times in the last week, making sure everything was in order. He checked his watch. Again the tallies showed. Again he covered them. He didn‚Äôt know why he bothered. ‚ÄúI better get going.‚Äù  
  
¬† Henry nodded. ‚ÄúI know this isn‚Äôt what you wanted, and I hope it proves unnecessary, but‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† August frowned. ‚ÄúDo you really think the truce will break?‚Äù He tried to picture V-City as it must have been, two halves at war along a bloody center. In North City, Harker. In South City, Flynn. Those wanting to pay for their safety against those willing to fight for it. Die for it.  
  
¬† Henry rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúI hope it holds,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúfor all our sakes.‚Äù It was a deflection, but August let it go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet some rest, Dad.‚Äù  
  
¬† Henry smiled grimly and shook his head. ‚ÄúNo rest for the wicked,‚Äù he said, and August knew he wasn‚Äôt referring to himself.  
  
¬† He headed for the elevators, but someone was already there, his shape silhouetted by the light of the open doors.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLittle brother.‚Äù  
  
¬† The voice was low and smooth, almost hypnotizing, and a second later the shadow shifted and stepped forward, resolving into a man with broad shoulders and a wiry form, all lean muscle and long bone. The FTF fatigues fit him perfectly, and beneath his rolled sleeves, small black crosses circled both forearms. Above a chiseled jaw, fair hair swept down into eyes as black as pitch. The only imperfection was a small scar running through his left eyebrow‚Äîa relic from his first years‚Äîbut despite the mark, Leo Flynn looked more god than monster.  
  
¬† August felt himself standing taller, trying to mirror his brother‚Äôs posture before he remembered that it was too rigid for a student. He slouched again, only this time too far, and then couldn‚Äôt remember what normal looked like. All the while, Leo‚Äôs black eyes hovered on him, unblinking. Even when he was flesh and blood, he didn‚Äôt quite pass for human.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe young Sunai, off to school.‚Äù There was no uptick in his voice, no question.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet me guess,‚Äù said August, managing a crooked grin, ‚Äúyou wanted to see me off as well? Tell me to have fun?‚Äù  
  
¬† Leo cocked his head. He‚Äôd never been very good at sarcasm‚Äînone of them were, really, but August had picked up scraps from the guys in the FTF.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour enjoyment is hardly my concern,‚Äù said Leo. ‚ÄúBut your focus is. Not even out the door, August, and you‚Äôve already forgotten something.‚Äù  
  
¬† He lobbed an object through the air and August caught it, cringing at the contact. It was a North City medallion, embossed with a V on one side and a series of numbers on the other. Made of iron, the medal prickled unpleasantly against his palm. Pure metal repelled monsters: Corsai and Malchai couldn‚Äôt touch the stuff; Sunai simply didn‚Äôt like to (all the FTF uniforms were traced with it, but his and Leo‚Äôs had been woven with an alloy).  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo I really have to wear this?‚Äù he asked. The prolonged contact was already making him nauseous.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you want to pass for one of them,‚Äù said Leo simply. ‚ÄúIf you want to get caught and slaughtered, then by all means, leave it off.‚Äù August swallowed, and slid the pendant over his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a solid forgery,‚Äù continued his brother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll pass a cursory inspection by any human eye, but don‚Äôt be caught north of the Seam after dark. I wouldn‚Äôt test it against anything that actually comes to heel at Harker‚Äôs side.‚Äù  
  
¬† Of course, it wasn‚Äôt the metal alone that kept the monsters at bay. It was Harker‚Äôs sigil. His law.  
  
¬† August settled the medallion against his shirt, zipping up the FTF-issued jacket over it. But as he moved to step into the elevator, Leo barred his path. ‚ÄúHave you eaten recently?‚Äù  
  
¬† He swallowed, but the words were already rising in his throat. There was a difference between the inability to lie and the need to speak the truth, but silent omission was a luxury he didn‚Äôt have when it came to his brother. When a Sunai asked a question, he commanded an answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAugust,‚Äù chided Leo. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always hungry.‚Äù  
  
¬† He flinched. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat later.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leo didn‚Äôt respond, only watched him, black eyes narrowed, and before he could say anything else‚Äîor make August say anything else‚ÄîAugust pushed past him. Or at least, he tried to. He was halfway to the elevator when Leo‚Äôs hand snapped out and closed over his. The one holding his violin case.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen you don‚Äôt need this.‚Äù  
  
¬† August went stiff. In four years, he‚Äôd never left the compound without the instrument. The thought made him dizzy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat if something happens?‚Äù he asked, panic climbing.  
  
¬† A ghost of amusement rippled through Leo‚Äôs features. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll just have to get your hands dirty.‚Äù With that, he pulled the case from August‚Äôs grip and nudged him into the elevator. August stumbled, then turned back, his hands prickling with the sudden absence of the violin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood-bye, brother,‚Äù said Leo, punching the button for the lobby.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave fun at school,‚Äù he added as the doors slid shut.  
  
¬† August shoved his hands into his pockets as the elevator plunged twenty floors. The compound was part skyscraper, part base of operations, all fortress. A concrete beast, steel, barbed wire, and Plexiglas, most of it dedicated to barracks housing members of the task force. The vast majority of the FTF‚Äôs sixty thousand officers were housed in other barracks across the city, but the nearly a thousand stationed at the compound served as camouflage as much as anything. The fewer people coming in and out of the building, the more each one stood out. And if you were Harker, trying to ferret out Flynn‚Äôs three Sunai, his secret weapons, you were keeping track of every face. It wasn‚Äôt so much a problem for Leo, since he was the face of the FTF, or Ilsa, since she never left the compound, but Henry was determined to keep August‚Äôs identity a secret.  
  
¬† On the ground floor, people were already streaming in and out of the building (with the night curfew as it was, days started early), and August moved with them, as if he were one of them, across the concrete lobby and through the guarded doors and onto the street. The morning washed over him, warm and bright and tarnished only by the disk of metal scratching against his skin and the absence of his violin.  
  
¬† Sunlight seeped between the buildings, and August took a deep breath and looked up at the Flynn compound looming overhead. Four years of hardly ever going out, and even then, almost always at night. Now here he was. Outside. Alone. Twenty-four million people in this supercity at last count, and he was only one of them, just another face in the morning commute. For one, dazzling, infinite moment, August felt like he was standing on a precipice, the end of one world and the beginning of another, a whisper and a bang.  
  
¬† And then his watch beeped, dragging him back from the edge, and he set off.  
  
¬† The black sedan cut through the city like a knife.  
  
¬† Kate watched as it carved down streets, across bridges, the traffic splitting like flesh as the car sliced its way through North City. Outside, the morning was loud and bright, but from within, it looked like an old movie, all the color leeched out by the tinted windows. Classical music piped through the radio, soft but steady, reinforcing the illusion of calm that most people bought into so willingly. When she asked the driver, a stone-faced man named Marcus, to c  
hange the station, and he ignored the request, she put her left earbud in and hit play. Her world became a heavy beat, a rhythm, an angry voice, as she leaned back into the leather bench of the backseat and let the city slide past. From here, it looked almost normal.  
  
¬† V-City was a place Kate knew only in glimpses, snapshots, time-lapse moments strung together with years of space between each one. She‚Äôd been sent away once for her own safety, stolen a second time in the dead of night, and banished a third for her mother‚Äôs crimes. But she was finally back where she belonged. In her father‚Äôs city. At her father‚Äôs side.  
  
¬† And this time, she wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.  
  
¬† Kate fiddled with her lighter as she studied the tablet propped in her lap, a map of V-City filling the screen. At first glance, it looked like every other supercity‚Äîa high-density center trailing off at the edges‚Äîbut when she tapped the screen with a metallic nail, a new layer of information appeared.  
  
¬† A black line cut across the image from left to right, bisecting the city. The Seam. In reality, it wasn‚Äôt a straight line, but it was a hard one, carving V-City in two. Stand on the North side, and you were in Callum Harker‚Äôs territory. Stand on the South side, and you were in Henry Flynn‚Äôs. Such a simplistic solution to six messy, brutal years of fighting, of sabotage and murder and monsters. Draw a line in the sand. Stay on your half. No wonder it wasn‚Äôt holding up.  
  
¬† Flynn was an idealist, and it was well and good to talk of justice, to have a ‚Äúcause,‚Äù but at the end of the day his people were dying. Flesh and bone versus tooth and claw.  
  
¬† V-City didn‚Äôt need a moral code. It needed someone willing to take control. Someone willing to get his hands dirty. It needed Harker. Kate had no pretentions‚Äîshe knew her father was a bad man‚Äîbut this city didn‚Äôt need a good one.  
  
¬† Good and bad were weak words. Monsters didn‚Äôt care about intentions or ideals. The facts were simple. The South was chaos. The North was order. It was an order bought and paid for with blood and fear, but order all the same.  
  
¬† Kate traced her finger along the Seam, over the grayed square that marked the Barren.  
  
¬† Why had her father settled for only half the city? Why did he let Flynn hide behind his wall, just because he had a few strange monsters on a leash?  
  
¬† She chewed her lip, tapped the map again, and a third layer of information appeared.  
  
¬† Three concentric circles‚Äîlike a bull‚Äôs-eye‚Äîghosted over the top of the map. It was the risk grid, designed to show the increase in monsters and the need for vigilance as one traveled in toward the center of the city. A band of green formed the outer ring, followed by yellow, and red at the center. Most people didn‚Äôt pay attention to the zones during the day, but everyone knew the boundaries, the place where the violent red gave way to the vigilant yellow before bleeding into the relative safety of the green. Of course, for those with her father‚Äôs protection, the risk dropped to almost zero . . . so long as you stayed within the North City limits. Go past the green and you hit the Waste, where North and South didn‚Äôt matter, because it was every man for himself.  
  
¬† Go far enough and you eventually found safe ground again; out near the borders where monsters were still rare, the population kept low. Out where supercity people weren‚Äôt welcome in case they brought the darkness with them like a plague. Where a girl might burn down a chapel, or lie in a field of grass beside her mom and learn the summer stars . . .  
  
¬† Somewhere, a horn, and Kate looked up, the house in the country dissolving back into the city streets. She stared past the partition and the driver and the front window, at the silver gargoyle on the hood. The car had originally come with an angel ornament, arms and wings flung back by some invisible wind, but Harker had broken it off and replaced it with the beast, hunched forward, tiny claws curling around the front lip of the grill.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is a city of monsters,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, tossing the angel in the trash.  
  
¬† Her father was right about that. But monsters‚Äîreal monsters‚Äîdidn‚Äôt look like the stupid little hood ornament. No, real monsters were much worse.  
  
¬† August tipped his face toward the sun, savoring the late summer morning as he walked, letting his body move and his mind go blissfully still. It was amazing how easy it was to think in straight lines when he was in motion, even without the violin. He made his way down cracked sidewalks, past buildings with boarded windows. Half the structures were burned-out husks, abandoned and gutted, any useful materials scraped out to fortify other buildings. South V-City still looked like a ravaged corpse, but it was rebuilding. FTF were everywhere, standing on rooftops, patrolling the streets, radio signals crackling from the handhelds on their uniforms. At night, they hunted monsters, but during the day, they tried to stop new ones from being made. Crime. That was the cause. Corsai, Malchai, Sunai‚Äìthey were the effect.  
  
¬† August blended in with the heavy foot traffic as he made his way north, the noise of the city like music around him, full of harmony and dissonance, rhythm and clash. It layered and layered until the melody tipped into discord, the wonder turning to distress, and he had to fight to focus on the path instead of everything in it. The path itself was easy, four blocks straight up Center Ave.  
  
¬† A beeline to the Seam.  
  
¬† August‚Äôs steps slowed as it came into sight.  
  
¬† The barrier was massive, a three-story barricade cutting east to west through the downtown, warded with stripes of pure metal and studded with cameras. The wall was the result of six years of territory war, each act of violence, each human death, ushering more Corsai and Malchai into the world, all because the Flynns had the city, and Harker wanted it.  
  
¬† Two blocks to the west sat the Barren‚Äîa ruined block of scorched earth, a reminder to both sides. It had been a plaza once, a piece of green at the heart of the city, but now there was nothing. Some people said you could see the outlines of the dead still ghosted on the pavement. Most of the FTF said that Henry Flynn had detonated a weapon there on the last day of the territory wars, something bad enough to scrub every sign of life. August didn‚Äôt believe that‚Äîdidn‚Äôt want to believe it‚Äîbut whatever happened that day, the threat of an encore was enough to make Harker call terms, agree to cut V-City in two.  
  
¬† By day, the capital was still unified, at least in theory. Three gates were punched out of the Seam to let people through, but they were monitored by armed men and the ever-watchful red eyes of the moving cameras, and everyone who passed through had to show identification while the scanning cameras verified them as human.  
  
¬† Which was a problem.  
  
¬† August turned down a narrow half-ruined street that ran parallel to the Seam until he reached an office building, its windows replaced by sheets of steel, a pair of FTF flanking the door. The woman at the front desk offered him a short nod as he passed through security and down a separate elevator to the basement. Small dots of neon paint on the wall marked the path and he followed them through a web of dank hallways to a wall. Or what looked like a wall. Metal sheeting pushed aside to reveal a tunnel, and August made his way along until he reached a matching false wall on the other end. He slid it open, and stepped out into the cellar of a ground floor apartment.  
  
¬† It was quiet here, and he paused, hating how relieved he felt to be alone again so soon. He gave himself ten seconds, waiting for his heart to slow and his nerves to settle, before he dusted himself off, and climbed the stairs.  
  
¬† Paris was chain-smoking and cooking breakfast.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt even startle when August appeared in the kitchen behind her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning, doll,‚Äù she called, her iron medallion dangling dangerously close to her omelet. Allies on the North side were rare, and extremely expensive, and even then they were risky, but Henry and Paris were old friends, and she‚Äôd passed Leo‚Äôs inspection. August looked around. Her apartment was . . . cozy, like pictures he‚Äôd seen in magazines from before the Phenomenon. Tile and wood and window glass. ‚ÄúSubway pass is on the table.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Paris,‚Äù he said, unzipping his FTF jacket and hanging it on a hook by the door. His shirtsleeves had ridden up again, and tw  
o rows of black tallies were now showing. He pulled the material down, even though Paris couldn‚Äôt see the marks. Couldn‚Äôt see anything, for that matter.  
  
¬† Paris might be blind, but her other senses were sharp. Sharp enough to notice the absence of his violin, the barely audible vibration of its strings within the case. She blew a thoughtful puff of smoke.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo concert today?‚Äù she asked, dripping ash into her eggs.  
  
¬† August‚Äôs fingers curled the way they always did around the case‚Äôs handle but found only air. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, digging the Colton Academy blazer from his bag and shrugging it on before the hall mirror. He was surprised to see his features crinkle, almost automatically, into a frown.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFlynn told me about your music,‚Äù mumbled Paris, to herself, and he knew by her tone that when she said your, she meant all three of them. ‚ÄúAlways wondered what it sounds like . . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† August buttoned the blazer. ‚ÄúI hope you never know,‚Äù he said, heading for the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back before dark.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave a good day at school,‚Äù she called as it closed behind him, and unlike Leo, she actually sounded like she meant it.  
  
¬† August stepped onto the street and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the Seam safely at his back. And then he turned north, and his eyes widened. He‚Äôd braced himself, but the difference between the two sides of V-City still caught him in the chest. North City wasn‚Äôt a bombed-out shell. Whatever scars it had, they‚Äôd all been covered up, painted over. Here the buildings glittered, all metal, stone, and glass, the streets dotted with slick cars and people in nice clothes‚Äîif Harker had enforcers on the street, they blended in. A shop window was filled with fruit so colorful it made August want to try it, even though he knew it would taste like ash.  
Anger flared through him at the sight‚Äîthe illusion‚Äîof this safe, clean city, and the tallies across his skin prickled in warning, their warmth countered by the sickly cool weight of the medallion against his chest. Focus, focus.  
  
¬† The nearest subway station sat a block away. South City had shut down the subways‚Äîit was too dangerous, what with the Corsai flocking to the dark‚Äîand boarded up the passages as best they could, even though August knew the FTF still used the tunnels when they had to.  
  
¬† He took the stairs two at a time. He‚Äôd read somewhere that V-City had grown up as much as out, that the buildings were actually built on top of the old grid, the subways where the original streets used to be. He didn‚Äôt know if it was true, but the subway station below was as clean as the roads above, buffed white stone and, somewhere underneath the sounds of foot traffic, a strain of classical music. A piano concerto. No signs of struggle or suffering, no remnant of the terrors that came out at night. It was a trick, meant to lure South siders over and remind North siders why they paid the price.  
  
¬† August got to the platform just in time to miss the train. He slumped back against a post to wait for the next one, his attention wandering from a couple kissing farther down the line to a busker playing guitar before it finally settled on a small girl in front of him, clutching a woman‚Äôs hand. She looked over at him, and August stared back, fascinated by the sight of such a young child. There were so few children in the compound, so few in South City for that matter. The girl broke into a toothy grin, and August found himself smiling back.  
  
¬† And then she starting singing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMonsters, monsters, big and small,‚Äù she sang cheerfully. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna come and eat you all.‚Äù  
  
¬† A shiver ran through him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCorsai, Corsai, tooth and claw,  
  
¬† Shadow and bone will eat you raw.  
  
¬† Malchai, Malchai, sharp and sly,  
  
¬† Smile and bite and drink you dry.‚Äù  
  
¬† August swallowed hard, knowing what came next.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSunai, Sunai, eyes like coal,  
  
¬† Sing you a song and steal your soul.‚Äù  
  
¬† The little girl‚Äôs smile grew even wider.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMonsters, monsters, big and small,  
  
¬† They‚Äôre gonna come and eat you all!‚Äù  
  
¬† She gave a small, delighted squeal, and August felt ill and took a step away.  
  
¬† When the train pulled into the station, he chose another car.  
  
¬† Monsters, monsters, big and small . . .  
  
¬† Kate hummed as the car barreled on. She tapped the tablet‚Äôs screen, closing out of the map and opening a new window, clicking through the folders on her father‚Äôs private drive‚Äîshe‚Äôd swiped the access codes on her first night home‚Äîuntil she found the ones she was looking for. Harker had surveillance throughout North City, not just on the Seam but on nearly every block of the red zone. Every day the footage was checked and then cleared, save for any ‚Äúincidents‚Äù‚Äîthose were stored so he could see them and take action, if necessary. These ‚Äúincidents‚Äù would never make the news, of course. They knew better than to put stuff like this on TV. It would disturb the illusion of normalcy, of safety‚Äîand that‚Äôs what the people were paying for.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

1mhdr89,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1mhdr89/why_should_you_consider_the_boss_gt1b_bass/,Why Should You Consider the BOSS GT-1B Bass Effects Processor?,"Reviewing the BOSS GT-1B was an experience worth savoring. It‚Äôs not every day I come across a bass multi-effects processor that manages to pack a punch while staying compact and lightweight. I‚Äôve been putting it through its paces for weeks now, and this model definitely delivers some unexpected surprises. From live gigs to studio work, this little gadget made its way into various setups with ease.

**Sleek Design That‚Äôs Travel-Ready**

You wouldn‚Äôt believe how easy this thing is to carry around. At just 1.1 pounds, it‚Äôs lighter than my trusty coffee thermos, yet rugged enough for regular gigs. What's fascinating is the smooth, modern design. With no hard edges, I felt confident tossing it into my instrument bag without worrying about scratches or dings. A small but surprisingly thoughtful touch that genuinely enhances its portability.

**User-Friendly Controls and Layout**

Ever had one of those devices where you need a PhD in audio engineering just to get started? That‚Äôs not the case here. The streamlined interface on this bass effects unit is intuitive and responsive. Tinkering with this multi-effects processor feels smooth‚Äîwhether it's adjusting the expression pedal or fiddling with the control switch. The user experience has been delightful. The included BOSS Tone Central connection also came in handy for snagging new patches and experimenting with software customization.

[Check BOSS GT-1B deals on Amazon now.](https://cavenyc.com/p/b072xkkh8d/)

**Pro-Level Sound Quality in a Compact Package**

What truly stunned me is the depth of the sound. We're talking premium BOSS sound here, tailored specifically for bass. From clean tones to gritty bass distortion, the variety is insane. Having advanced MDP effects available on a device this small is a treat. During a live set, I even toggled multiple effects effortlessly, thanks to the responsive pedal. Best part? The performance held steady‚Äîeven through those heavy drops and slap bass interludes.

**Key Benefits**

- Compact and lightweight, perfect for mobile setups.
- Bass-optimized amp and effects combinations.
- Intuitive patch editing with BOSS Tone Central integration.
- Durable design, travel-friendly without added bulk.

**Battery or Corded Power Options**

It‚Äôs worth noting that the GT-1B supports both corded operation and battery power. The option to power it with 4 AA batteries meant I could even take it to an outdoor jam session without needing a reliable electrical source. However, the lack of rechargeable options for the batteries could‚Äôve been a useful upgrade for modern convenience.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The onboard display felt cramped for more detailed adjustments.
- Beginners might find the range of effects somewhat overwhelming.
- Requires a bit of practice to maximize real-time effect switching effectively.

**Challengers in the Market**  

When matching it up against similar models, the Line 6 HX Stomp immediately comes to mind. While the HX Stomp offers a broader variety of effects and amps compared to the GT-1B, its interface isn‚Äôt as beginner-friendly and the price tag leans heavier on the wallet. On the other hand, the Zoom B3n provides a closer-priced alternative, but the sound quality and portability don‚Äôt quite match up to the GT-1B‚Äôs polished performance.

The GT-1B‚Äôs distinct advantage lies in its bass customization possibilities, compact frame, and budget-conscious price point. While competitors may outshine it in niche areas, this device keeps things balanced for an array of users.

**Bang for the Buck**  

Evaluating the price-to-performance balance, this model holds solid ground. You're getting pro-level orchestration options bundled in a user-friendly design without making a massive financial commitment. It‚Äôs hard to argue against the value the GT-1B offers, given its standout sound quality and easy mobility for bass enthusiasts at any level. Whether jamming solo, recording at home, or hopping between gigs, it rises to the occasion.

1mhdpsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mhdpsk/should_best_wireless_earbuds_xinwld_a97_pro_be/,Should best wireless earbuds Xinwld A97 Pro be your next pick,"The Xinwld A97 Pro earbuds have been my go-to for the last few weeks, and they've been through it all‚Äîcommutes, gym sessions, Zoom calls, and even a rainy jog. These sleek wireless earbuds came into my life boasting Bluetooth 5.4 technology, ENC noise canceling, and a staggering 40-hour playback time, which frankly seemed too good to be true initially. But after repeatedly pushing them to their limits, I must say that while they don‚Äôt come without their quirks, they certainly pack a lot into their modest price bracket.

**Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality**  
The design of these earbuds caught my attention right away. Despite being ultra-light, they don't feel flimsy. In fact, the ergonomic shape fits snugly into my ears, and I‚Äôve never once worried about them popping out, even during a particularly intense workout session. Being IP7 waterproof is a real bonus because I didn‚Äôt have to think twice about using them in the rain. And carrying the compact, lightweight charging case around is effortless. Everything about the A97 Pro's style screams minimalistic functionality, which I love.

**Hi-Fi Sound Quality and Noise Canceling Features**  
Audio for me is everything. These earbuds deliver a crisp, immersive listening experience thanks to their 13 mm drivers and AAC/SBC audio coding technologies. Whether I was powering through my favorite playlists or taking calls, the clarity and deep bass hit the spot. The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) microphones reduce background noise pretty reliably in calmer environments, though I found them struggling slightly in particularly windy conditions. A few coworkers did tell me my voice was clear during calls, even in moderate background noise, so it‚Äôs no slouch in that respect either.

**Winning Points**  
- Bluetooth 5.4 technology ensures seamless pairing and super-stable connectivity, even if I wander a few rooms away.  
- The 40-hour playback time, split as 8 hours on the earbuds themselves and the added hours from the charging case, is a lifesaver. No battery anxiety here!  
- Universal compatibility with anything Bluetooth 4.0 and above makes these earbuds versatile for all users, whether you're sporting a new iPhone or a seasoned Android device.  

[See Xinwld A97 Pro deals on Amazon now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dxf5f1tl/)  

**Touch Controls: Convenient, but Not Flawless**  
Let me be upfront about this: touch controls are both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it‚Äôs convenient to adjust volume, change tracks, or answer calls with just a tap. On the other, it‚Äôs way too easy to accidentally pause music or wake Siri when adjusting the earbuds in your ear. This isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but the responsiveness can feel a bit finicky at times.

**Battery Performance That Goes the Distance**  
Charging these earbuds takes about an hour, and they reward you with an impressive runtime. The LED display is particularly handy when you‚Äôre traveling‚Äîit‚Äôs nice not to guess the remaining charge. I've owned wireless headphones before where guessing battery life drove me crazy, so this simple display feature brought me serious peace of mind. And as someone prone to binge-watching shows, having 40 hours of total playback practically ensures I‚Äôll never run out mid-episode.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Touch controls can be overly sensitive, resulting in accidental interruptions.  
- The ENC noise reduction isn‚Äôt suited for very noisy environments like bustling coffee shops or busy roads.  
- No aptX codec support means the audio may not be as high-fidelity as some audiophiles might prefer.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
I‚Äôve dabbled with other competitors in the past. Brands like Jabra and Anker sport better noise cancellation and often come with aptX support for that higher-tier sound quality. However, they usually come at a steeper price point. The A97 Pro competes favorably when you consider its affordability alongside its long battery life and sweat-proof design. For everyday use, including workouts and commutes, these earbuds absolutely hold their ground.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of value, I think the A97 Pro earbuds deliver affordable quality that punches well above their price category. While premium features like adaptive noise-canceling or ultra-long-range Bluetooth coverage aren‚Äôt on the menu, the robust sound quality, waterproofing, and exceptional battery life make them a smart spending choice for most users. If you're looking for an all-rounder that‚Äôll work seamlessly with smartphones, laptops, or tablets, these won‚Äôt disappoint.

But often I want a good quality coffee, but I don't need the particular speed of the espresso machine. In coffee-loving countries like Brazil and Australia, you have the middle options like french press coffee or mocha pot coffee. You have to wait a bit longer for the brewing process, but the shop doesn't have to buy a machine that cost as much as a car so it's cheaper.

1mhdp3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mhdp3o/casual_weight_loss_is_a_myth/,Casual weight loss is a myth,"I (43f) noticed a couple of years ago that I was putting on a bit more weight than I wanted. Nothing crazy, about 150 when I like to be more like 130. I knew I wouldn't be able to do a complete overhaul of my entire life and maintain that long term, so instead I started making small changes to my life and habits.

I went from drinking almost a 2L of Pepsi a day to maybe a can a week. I switched from Pepsi in my insulated tumbler, to koolaid or lemonade, and now I almost always drink just ice water. 

I went from eating a big bowl of sugary cereal in whole milk for breakfast, to a scrambled egg and a slice of whole wheat toast. Switched from butter on my toast to lower calorie plant butter.

I gradually reduced the sugar in my morning coffee to none, and creamer. Now I add a dash of oatmilk or just drink it black.

I started reading labels and counting calories. I realized that box of Milk Duds was actually 600 calories and I didn‚Äôt need to be eating 600 calories as a little pick me up on my work break.

I started packing my work lunches instead of getting fast food. I went from eating fast food at least three times a week to maybe once a month as a treat for my kids.

I started focusing on eating vegetables as much as possible. Instead of making a big piece of meat and a small side salad for dinner, I started making a big salad, a side vegetable like squash or green beans, and a small piece of meat. I switched from ranch dressing to vinaigrette on my salads. I added chopped broccoli and bell pepper to my morning eggs.

I switched from snacking on chips and crackers to snacking on fruits and vegetables. I kept celery and carrots and apples in the refrigerator at all times. I started dipping my veggies in humus or yogurt or salsa instead of ranch dressing or onion dip. I stopped buying chips, crackers, cookies, and candy. I started giving my kids a snack allowance to buy their own stuff to keep in their rooms so I would not see it when I was hungry.

I don't binge eat, or eat out at all. I wait 10 minutes before having seconds at dinner to ask myself if I am really actually still hungry. I walk as much as I can and get my steps in every day. When I feel like snacking I first drink a glass of water and clean something to see if I'm hungry or just bored. 

After two years of making all of these changes, the payoff was...that I gained 10 pounds. I now weigh 160. Nothing I did helped. Apparently making small lifestyle changes is completely pointless. Yes, I see a doctor. No, there is nothing physically wrong with me and all my bloodwork is fine. I don't weigh enough to go on Ozempic or anything. I have been trying to avoid making a fuss about my weight or passing along body image issues to my teenage daughter. But all the quiet, small changes have gotten me exactly nowhere. Apparently the only way to lose weight is by completely changing the way I do everything from the ground up, and just hoping I could somehow maintain that massive deprivation forever. I used to think it was possible to just casually lose weight without making it your entire personality. But I was wrong. ",1,1754314701.0,Vent,16,0.67,False

She is now back in the States and wants to cotinue tutoring with me.,"A student I tutor recently graduated from college in New York and visited Bangkok, Thailand (where I live) with her friends. She told me about her plans to visit at the end of tutoring session several times but didn't ask me to meet up or anything, which I found hurtful. I'm a guy and I'm wondering if she feels unsafe about me, if she thinks I'll do bad things to her if we were to meet up, etc.

I sent her an email asking if she wants to meet up in BKK but she replied several days later when she was back in the U.S. She requested tutoring sessions to resume but I haven't replied to her message in over a month because I'm furious at her for not asking to meet up when she flew half-away across the world to visit a city I'm living in.

If a student you teach online were to visit your City, wouldn't grabbing coffee or a meal be a nice thing to do?

I'm probably the only tutor who can help her achieve her goals so she needs me more than I need her. Yet she let it be known that she didn't want to meet me in person, yet wants me to continue passionatley teaching her online. I've been tutoring her for a little over a year now.

My question is this: why did the student let me know she was visiting Bangkok and then NOT ask me to meet up? Does she think I'm a creep or something? If she thinks I'm dangerous or a creep, why does she want to resume tutoring?

I'm a pretty darn good tutor but I suffer from Asperger's syndrome, which makes me act really weird at times, especially around women. I'm concerned that I might have scared her off or something like that.",0,1754314464.0,TutorsHelpingTutors,15,0.33,False
1mhdkqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1mhdkqc/its_time_to_adjust_the_winch_claw/,It's time to adjust the winch claw,"With all the close range weapons being nerfed, the winch claw has become the current darling of degenerate design and the centerpiece of yet another game-balance tragedyince. You have no way to fight back, nor any time to react due to being stunned and displaced all the way to Africa. Pair it with the highest close range DPS weapons such as the shak and the SA, and you have the most toxic and low skill playstyle for the heavy. Which happens to be the metaslave loadout for this season. Low effort, high reward, and zero shame required.

The winch comes with so few downsides it might as well be a premium battle pass perk:

- Offers a long range stun and displacement
- You have 2 chances to hit it (on press and on the hook returning)
- it bypasses all shields (why..?)
- Gives you cashout manipulation
- Low cooldown (7s to 14s)

This thing is the Swiss Army knife of bullshit. It does everything except make you a coffee while you cheese your way to victory. Especially considering the other specializations only offer 2 benefits at most, aside from the goo gun which desperately needs them. Picking the winch is pretty much a no-brainer.

With the following in mind, the winch should be adjusted by:

- Removing the stun if used with ranged weapons - The stun is enough to disable counterplay since you have a medium-long range rifle and you stand no chance in close range when pulled. You have 0 time to react. While back when it was used with the sledgehammer, you at least had time to put a jump pad, slide behind the heavy, dash away, charge away, etc. Another variant is to make the stun lost if the user is damaged before getting the winch off or adding a quick melee skillcheck for the victim during the animation.
- Remove the return hook chance - There is no reason for this since you have already failed the skillcheck on the initial miss.
- Turn the winch into a projectile - This way the winch will be blocked by Dome shield, mesh shield and APS turret, resulting in a buff to those 3 and giving them another usage case. This also denies ""kidnapping"" the person stealing or the cashout itself when inside a dome shield, while you are safely hiding 1 floor above.

It started 2 days ago. I had an annoying warm feeling in my leg. after half an hour, it disappeared. Soon after I felt chest tightness, wanted to breathe a lot, head felt light. After 3 min, the feeling went away.

And today, I wake up at night because my heart beats once per two seconds. Beats so loud I can feel it in my whole body. After like 10 seconds, it goes a bit faster, then returns back to normal. Then I get the same chest tightness, breathing a lot, light head, wanted to vomit. After 5 minutes, it went away again, ambulance came and found nothing wrong with me, told me to rest.

Since then, I get these episodes of chest tightness, light head, wanting do breathe. In those times, heart rate is at 100+ and pulse oximeter consistently shows 97-99. ECG that I did today found abnormally short P-Q 90ms. Back 1.5 years ago, it was normal 119 ms, and ultrasound of the heart done back then showed nothing wrong. My blood test shows nothing wrong except vitamin D deficiency.

I don't know what to do. please, please help me

1mhdfmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1mhdfmn/explore_why_the_best_keurig_coffee_maker_might_be/,Explore Why the Best Keurig Coffee Maker Might Be the K-Slim,"The Keurig K-Slim Coffee Maker made a perfect addition to my kitchen. I wasn‚Äôt particularly short on counter space, but the compact design of this machine made it a seamless fit without looking bulky or overbearing. Measuring less than 12 cm wide, it feels like it was designed with meticulous thought for smaller spaces or anyone who appreciates a clutter-free countertop. I put it next to my toaster, and it still left me with enough room to navigate my kitchen essentials. 

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
I can't stress enough how straightforward the brewing process is with this coffee maker. The simple push-button controls eliminate any confusion, which was especially ideal on groggy mornings when my brain wasn‚Äôt fully operational. I tested all three cup sizes‚Äî237 ml, 296 ml, and 355 ml. The option to choose is fantastic, whether I need a quick energy shot or have the luxury of enjoying a larger serving. Plus, the coffee brewed fast without sacrificing flavor. At one point, I was rushing to join a Zoom call, and the machine had my coffee ready in minutes. Efficiency at its best!  

[Check Keurig K-Slim coffee maker price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0bdt6htjj/)  

**MultiStream Technology: What Sets It Apart**  
One feature that genuinely wowed me was the MultiStream Technology. It‚Äôs not something I had seen in similar coffee makers before, and I noticed a real difference. Unlike other machines that spray a single stream of water into your K-Cup, this one employs multiple streams to evenly saturate the pod. You end up getting full flavor and aroma in every brew. It was as though every cup jumped out of the caf√©‚Äîrich, aromatic, and satisfying. My parents, who visited recently and tried it, even asked if I had upgraded to gourmet coffee.  

**Water Reservoir: A Small but Mighty Improvement**  
The removable 1.36 L water reservoir is a detail I underestimated initially. I brewed up to four cups before needing to refill, which was a lifesaver during my weekend gaming binge with friends. Refilling was straightforward, too‚Äîthe design made it easy to detach and reattach the reservoir without any fumbling. While it's not the largest capacity you‚Äôll find, it balances practicality with the slim design perfectly.

**Benefits**  
- Compact design saves counter space.  
- MultiStream Technology ensures robust flavor.  
- Fast brewing process enhances convenience.  

**Negatives**  
- The water reservoir could be larger for families or heavy coffee drinkers.  
- Not compatible with ground coffee unless you purchase a separate accessory.  

**Build Quality and Aesthetics**  
The sleek Twilight Blue color adds a modern touch to the kitchen without being too loud or overwhelming. Its build feels sturdy, though slightly lighter than I anticipated. While I was initially worried about durability given its minimalist weight, I‚Äôve been using it daily, and it hasn‚Äôt skipped a beat. The buttons function smoothly and don‚Äôt feel flimsy, which is a common issue in lower-budget appliances.

**Competing Products**  
While this coffee maker has a lot going for it, I had also tried the Nespresso Essenza Mini before settling on this one. Nespresso definitely earns points for its espresso-quality coffee, but its pod system is limited compared to Keurig‚Äôs expansive selection of K-Cup varieties. Moreover, the Essenza Mini‚Äôs water tank needs refilling much more frequently than the Keurig. The Keurig‚Äôs MultiStream Technology and ability to brew larger servings also tipped the scales in its favor. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew deserves a nod for its two-in-one feature, which allows both pod and ground coffee use, but the brew time felt sluggish compared to this machine.

**Value for Money**  
This coffee maker strikes that sweet spot of affordable quality. It‚Äôs stylish, functional, and has noticeably enhanced my daily coffee routine. While it doesn‚Äôt have the bells and whistles of pricier machines, it delivers consistent performance without burning a hole in your pocket. Given its mix of practicality and features like MultiStream Technology, you're truly getting an excellent price-to-quality ratio.

1mhdemj,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1mhdemj/delve_into_the_best_countertop_blender_vitamix/,Delve Into the Best Countertop Blender Vitamix E310 Review Worth It,"Owning the Vitamix VM0197 has been an interesting experience for someone like me who practically lives in the kitchen. Being a home cook, I often find myself experimenting with different recipes‚Äîfrom silky soups to chunky salsas. The promise of a ""professional-grade"" blender drew me in, and I knew I had to see if it could really live up to the hype. After testing it for weeks, here's a breakdown of how it performs and where it excels‚Äîor doesn‚Äôt.

**Build and Design: Robust and Kitchen-Friendly**  
Right out of the box, the Vitamix VM0197 impressed me with its design. The matte black finish not only looks sleek but also blends seamlessly with most kitchen d√©cors. However, I couldn‚Äôt help noticing how hefty it was. At 10.5 pounds, moving it back and forth from the cabinet can be tiresome. Its dimensions‚Äî11"" D x 8"" W x 18"" H‚Äîmean it doesn‚Äôt fit under all cabinets easily. 

The unit screams durability. True to the claim, the stainless steel blades feel sturdy enough to tackle the toughest ingredients. I‚Äôve thrown frozen fruits and even ice cubes at it, and it barely flinched. A reinforced motor base houses the cooling fan, adding to the durability. You don‚Äôt find components that scream ""cheap plastic,"" which is honestly rare nowadays.

**Performance that Packs a Punch**  
As someone who loves smoothies packed with greens, I‚Äôve tested its blending prowess extensively. The ten variable speed options offer a lot of control. Setting it to the lowest speeds lets you create coarse chops, while higher settings produce creamy blends that feel like they came straight out of a restaurant kitchen. 

The pulse option was surprisingly useful too. Thick soups and salsas turned out better than I‚Äôd expected since I could easily alternate between chunky and smooth textures. However, one thing caught me off guard‚Äîsince it‚Äôs so powerful, the container tends to shake a bit in higher settings. I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call it unstable, but you‚Äôll definitely want to keep an eye (or a hand) on it while in use.

**Ease of Maintenance: A Game-Changer for Me**  
Cleaning up after using the blender was one of my biggest initial concerns. With its self-cleaning feature, though, cleanup is ridiculously easy. All it takes is a drop of dish soap, some warm water, and about 30 to 60 seconds at the highest speed. It saved me a ton of time, and I didn‚Äôt even have to take it apart. Forget scrubbing; this is something busy users like myself will truly appreciate.

**Professional-Level Versatility**  
What really stood out to me is how versatile this blender is. From making nut butter (yes, I tried almond butter!) to mixing pancake batter, it can handle just about any task you throw at it. I even experimented with dry ingredients‚Äîthink grinding coffee beans‚Äîand it worked like a charm. However, with a 48 oz. container, it‚Äôs perfect for small to medium batches but might fall short if you‚Äôre cooking for a crowd. I did wonder if this size limitation might frustrate large families. 

[Check Vitamix VM0197 price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b0758jhzm3/)  

**Benefits Worth Highlighting**  
Here are some things I particularly loved:  
- The self-cleaning feature makes this blender a dream for daily users like me.  
- Variable speed control ensures incredible texture precision, whether you want chunky or smooth.  
- Professional-grade durability is evident in its stainless steel blades and sturdy motor base.  
- Compact enough for small batch recipes yet functional for a variety of uses.  

**Shortcomings That Might Bug You**  
Even with its perks, there are limitations:  
- Its weight could make it cumbersome to move frequently.  
- Limited container size makes it less than ideal for large families or meal prep in bulk.  
- At higher speeds, the vibrations are noticeable and might feel unsettling for certain users.  

**Competing Products Worth Considering**  
The Vitamix VM0197 isn‚Äôt without its competition. One of its closest rivals is the Ninja BL660, which boasts a similar ability to crush ice and tough ingredients. While the Ninja is much gentler on the wallet, it doesn‚Äôt quite match the finesse of the VM0197 in terms of consistency and durability. Another peer product, the Blendtec Total, offers an equally powerful blending experience with larger containers. However, I found the Vitamix edges it out with its superior ease of cleaning and quieter operation.

If versatility is your focus, though, there‚Äôs Breville Super Q, which arguably comes with more advanced features but gets significantly louder. All in all, VM0197 finds its niche by offering stellar performance without becoming overly complicated or requiring a small crane to carry it. 

**Price Worthiness Compared to Features**  
This blender feels like an investment rather than just another kitchen tool. Though it sits on the pricier side of the spectrum for countertop blenders, the features‚Äîthe stainless steel blades, pulse control, easy cleaning, and durable motor base‚Äîjustify the price if blending is a regular activity in your life. For someone like me, who values high-quality tools that don‚Äôt wear out after a year, it‚Äôs worth its cost. However, casual users making the occasional smoothie might cringe at the price tag unless they value premium build and longevity.

1mhdcv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottGalloway/comments/1mhdcv9/imports_do_not_subtract_from_gdp/,Imports Do Not Subtract from GDP,"I'll admit that I got pretty upset when I was listening to Pivot this weekend and I heard Scott say ""Imports subtract from GDP because that's economic activity in another country"" (paraphrasing).



Imports don't subtract from GDP. Imports are neutral to GDP.



If I buy a camera from Sony, I'm not poorer. The country isn't poorer. I get a new camera and measured consumption in the country goes up.



It's just a lot easier to measure products coming in at ports than it is to break down how much people, companies, and governments are spending and investing abroad. That's why we set up the GDP equation as Y = C + I + G + NX

(NX = net exports)

The full equation is Y = \[C(d) + C(m)\] + \[I(d) + I(m)\] + \[G(d) + G(m)\] + \[X - M\]

D is domestic. M is imports. 

and C(m) + I(m) + G(m) = M.



Because GDP measures the domestic economy, imports net out to zero. The we just write down the things that make actually measuring the gigantic and diverse American economy easier to get better data.



This bugs me so much because the ""Imports subtract from GDP"" mistake gives Trump too much credit and gives nationalists too much credit. They're just wrong.



I don't think Scott's an idiot or anything (most reporters make this mistake all the time). I think he was speaking off the cuff and made a common mistake, but since this mistake seems to be driving US economic policy, I think it's important to call is out when it happens, especially among people with such a following.



Economists and economic popularizers are continually explaining this, if anyone wants a longer explanation:



[https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/once-again-imports-do-not-subtract](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/once-again-imports-do-not-subtract)



[https://aneconomicsense.org/2025/05/12/imports-do-not-subtract-from-gdp-econ-101/](https://aneconomicsense.org/2025/05/12/imports-do-not-subtract-from-gdp-econ-101/)



Personally, my view is that imports do increase the US economy because Americans get access to the best products in the world (from cameras to coffee) and there's a huge supply chain industry that employees tons of people and creates tons of economic activity. That certainly doesn't make us worse off and probably makes us a bit better off, in an indirectly measured way.

The only mention we get of Lois in Mercy is when she calls Clark to tell him Martha didn't show up for the event she was going to. It's a subtle thing, and maybe I'm reading too much into it, which I never do of course lol, but Clark didn't hesitate to pick up when he saw she was calling, even when he was in the middle of talking to Chloe about Lionel. She's so important to him that it's just instinct to answer.

Our girl is back and she's just doing what we all do, avoiding work lol. Lois is playing a video game when Clark and Martha come home. Clark says her name but she's too caught up to hear him. Then he says it louder and that's when she looks over at him, which unfortunately gets her killed in the game There's all this new equipment that got set up, but Lois has no idea who it came from. Clark almost has a smile, but I'm not sure I can count it, but he's got his hands on his hips like a disappointed father lol.

Lois strong-arming a senator while doing crunches in the Kent living room is just so believable lol. So is her freaking out when a stranger appears in said living room. I know the line about her not being Clark's girlfriend in this lifetime is supposed to be a nod to their lore, but this is one I don't love as much. It's kind of dismissive. I'm glad this is the last bad guy Lois gives a chance, it makes much more sense for her to be drawn to heroes like A.C. and later Oliver, and of course Clark. Right now she's still in that flirting with bad boys stage, but while showing us Clark's decision to not keep the stuff is one she wouldn't have, Lois also understands why Clark made that decision. It's just who he is, and she knows that.

Graham convinces Clark to come out, and he brings him to a party that he's also brought Lois to. This is one of my favorite underrated scenes and one of my favorite dresses of hers and I swear it's actually Erica's because I saw her in the same one at some kind of press event. But Clark is shocked Lois is there, and the last time she was in a dress was when they technically went to his prom together, so I always thought that was in the back of his mind. He tries to talk with her, but Lois again is kind of dismissive here. I do love their synchronized ""What are you doing here?"", somehow they are still in tune even when he's shocked and she's annoyed lol. I did clock that Clark checked Lois out at least once, possibly twice, but the camera cuts so quickly it's hard to tell. Lois seems to like Graham and just wants Clark to ignore her, and Clark doesn't seem too happy that Lois is with a guy, something that is a recurring thing when it comes to Clark's unrealized feelings for Lois.

Ok I think this scene with Gia has a bit of nuance. So Clark earlier saw Lex and Lana kiss, so he now knows they are an item of sorts. Lois has told him to ignore her, Chloe is no longer an option to him like that, and here is this bold dark haired woman, secretly Clark's type, just coming onto him and kissing him and he is very flattered by the attention...until he realizes it's counterfeit because Graham paid her, and he doesn't shame her but he kindly rejects her.

I love Lois putting that much sugar in her coffee, even though I think they retcon this and in Rabid she requests black coffee. I think the scene in the new Superman movie is inspires by this one though. I also think this interaction with Lois and Graham is an interesting parallel to Lana with Lex in season 6. Because Graham wants to wine and dine Lois but she doesn't need all of that and suggests a place that sounds like it will look disgusting but taste delicious. Lois doesn't really flourish under that kind of power, but Lana does. Just an observation I had a while ago.

Even Graham with his limited time spent with them knows that Clark knows Lois pretty well.

Clark knows Graham is a killer and Chloe tells him that Lois is getting ready for a date with the guy. She goes to call her, but that's not good enough for Clark who speeds off to make sure Lois is ok. 

Lois is showering but feels like she's being watched, so what does she do? Turn off the water and grab a shower brush as a weapon of course. She opens the door, ready to throw down, and it's Clark. In front of Lois. Who isn't wearing a towel. Tom Welling does a really good job here. Clark is shocked at this turn of events, and he's trying to be respectful, the man is fighting for his life to keep looking at her face, but he can't help looking down. His eyes get really big and Lois doesn't know what to say and Clark doesn't know what to say, and Lois goes to shut the door and Clark just can't help himself. He looks down again at Lois in all her glory. After she shuts the door to get a towel, Clark steps away in a kind of daze, his feet stumbling a bit. He cannot believe that happened, and I wish we could have sat in that moment a bit longer, but the story must progress. So Lois asks what Clark is doing there, and he looks terrified and she's annoyed which is much safer territory for Clark than to be faced with the knowledge that he now knows what Lois looks like naked, so he tells her he's been calling and knocking on her apartment door. He asks how long she was in the shower and her answer of 90 minutes stuns him lol. I kind of love that Lois takes these long showers or baths, because I would imagine she never got to do that living on military bases, so it's a nice luxury for her.  Lois wants to know if Clark was the one creeping on her, he says he just got there, so she tells him she thought someone was in there. Clark says it's Graham, to which Lois is incredulous and wants to know why Clark always throws a grenade at every guy she dates. Inquiring minds want to know, Clark. But then Clark hears Graham and tells Lois to be quiet, who is actually quiet, even if she doesn't fully believe him.

There was another deleted scene in this episode that I really wish hadn't been cut. Martha comes and helps Lois find something to wear on her date, the yellow top that we see Lois admiring, and Martha tells her that if she had had a daughter, she would have wanted her to be like Lois, and Lois is so touched by that. I know we get the later scene, but this one could have been kept in too. Anyways, Chloe comes in looking for Clark, but Lois says he took off after warning her about Graham and she says she getting tired of his tendency to be overprotective of her, but Chloe tells her Graham is a killer, and Lois is like, ""Of course he is.""

They run out to find him, calling out his name, Chloe with Clark and Lois with Smallville. She does switch to Clark a few times, sounding very worried. Chloe calls his phone and they see he's been buried, they work frantically to unbury him, and this detail has always stuck with me. While Chloe finds the kryptonite and throws it away from Clark, Lois is cradling his face, calling him Clark again. She almost strokes his face in this moment, but then Chloe's hands kinda make her hands move. It's very quick but Chloe has that brown jacket and Lois has that blue jacket on so the sleeves tell you whose hand is there on his face. Idk, just another tiny little moment where we can see despite her teasing him, Lois truly cares for Clark. Meals out of crumbs lol.

Lois is back at the farm, talking business with Martha, who heard about what happened from Clark. That boy is just always talking about Lois. But Lois gives a glimpse into her love life saying she seems to be a magnet for unsavory guys. And since all we've seen from her is being coerced to go on a date with Tim, a couple of dates with A.C., and now this with Graham, I think she's alluding to the guys she dated before Smallville. We haven't heard about Wes yet either, but he seemed to be one of the good ones as well. So for me, it seems like both good and not so good guys are drawn to her, but she knows what to expect with the not so good and they don't scare her as much as the good, so she also gravitates towards them. Lois wonders why she can't just meet a decent guy from a decent family who happens not to be a psychopath, and we all know that that is Clark Kent to the letter. Martha tells her she had her own struggles with the dark and mysterious type, until she met Jonathan. And I swear she had a little twinkle in her eye when she said that, because Clark is Lois' Jonathan, they just don't know it yet. But Lois is worried that when her Jonathan does finally come around, she'll be looking the other way and she'll miss him completely. What if her soulmate comes along and she's too blind to see it? But Martha tells her she has to keep a closer watch...as in look closer to home....to someone always backing her up perhaps? That might be a bit of a stretch lol. She then says they go through these bad relationships for a reason. Lois wants to know what that reason is because all she's gotten is pain and aggravation. And Martha says, ""Maybe you have to get through all the wrong men so you can recognize the right one."" And I always took that to her secretly talking about Clark as well, because I believe Martha is firmly on the notLana team for Clark, and very well might be co-captain of the Lois and Clark team with Jimmy later. Lois takes comfort from Martha's advice though.

Clark is talking about how he feels seeing Lana with Lex, to Chloe, as if she doesn't know exactly how he feels initially when she saw him with Lana. And I know with the reaction shots of Chloe's face, we're supposed to see it as lingering feelings she has for Clark, but I don't personally see it that way. I see it as a wound that while healed, still pulls at the skin sometimes when faced with just how utterly oblivious Clark can be. She tells him Lana has moved on and so should he. Ugh if only that meant he could move onto Lois already.

I actually like this metaphor for the telescope as Clark and Lana's relationship. It reminds me of Dawson's Creek when Pacey used his boat as a metaphor for his relationship with Andie in season 2. But Clark is putting it away because he might still care, but it doesn't work anymore. And we all know he fell in love with Lana from afar, watching her through his telescope. She brings up that she hated when he was less than honest with her, and I know she's trying to be kind and fair, but I can't help but feel a twinge of smugness when she says she doesn't wanna be like that. That she can be honest with him even though he refused to be honest with her. And Clark's bitter reply of ""That's a good choice."", is delivered with just the right amount of regret and self hatred, because Clark wishes he could be that honest, but he just can't. She tells him she's been spending time with Lex, and he says he noticed, but that's not good enough for Lana I guess, so she says they've been seeing each other. This scene is similar to me with the one in Transference, when she tells ""Clark"" about Jason and when he doesn't react the way she wants him to, she says it's serious. Like she wants to hammer home someone has replaced him. Clark tries to warn her that she can't trust Lex, but she replies back with an incredulous, ""And I could trust you?"" And it's another time when she's trying to be kind, I know she is, but she gets that hard look on her face, full of resentment and distrust and bitterness. She tells Clark she knows he's being some kind of hero but she doesn't need him to protect her. Sure, Jan. I know their dynamics are different, but when Clark told Lois in Aqua he was looking out for her in that final scene in the barn, she tells him she appreciates it. She doesn't throw that protective quality back in his face like Lana does here. Clark tries to talk to Clark again, but she tells him it's over, and that he made that decision. And we fade to end credits. I will say, at this point, Lana seems to be well and truly over Clark, she seems exhausted with their dynamic and not all that heartbroken. And Clark seems to be sad, but really just scared of what might happen to Lana being involved with Lex. There's no going back this time, right? It's well and truly over. If only.

1mhd86x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mhd86x/explore_if_the_best_food_processor_from_cuisinart/,Explore if the best food processor from Cuisinart is worth it,"Testing out the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus has been a bit of a game-changer in my kitchen routine, I must admit. This brushed stainless four-cup food processor has seamlessly integrated itself into my culinary adventures. Whether I‚Äôm tackling a quick salsa or grinding nuts for a pastry, this little machine has shown its utility more times than I can count. Sure, the name ""Mini Prep Plus"" suggests compactness‚Äîand yes, it‚Äôs small‚Äîbut don‚Äôt underestimate its potential. It‚Äôs more than just pretty brushed stainless steel; it‚Äôs a hardworking little workhorse. 

**Convenient Design and Build Quality**

What immediately caught my eye when unboxing this food processor is its clean and modern look. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit comfortably on my cluttered countertop without hogging space. The stainless steel housing not only screams durability but also adds a touch of sophistication. The lightweight plastic body, coupled with the manageable dimensions of 3.9""D x 8.2""W x 8.2""H, makes it very easy to maneuver. That‚Äôs ideal whether you‚Äôre tidying up after prep or finding a spot for it in your cabinets.

[Check Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0000645yn/)

**Ease of Use for Everyday Tasks**

I‚Äôm a firm believer that kitchen gadgets should make your life easier, not more complicated, and the Mini Prep Plus does just that. Its simple push-button control panel is blissfully user-friendly‚Äîthere‚Äôs no fumbling over dials or advanced settings while your veggies wait patiently to be chopped. Plus, the reversible stainless steel blade is a nifty surprise. It doesn‚Äôt just chop; it can grind as well! Whether I‚Äôm crushing up some garlic or grinding coffee beans on an experimental whim, this processor makes it as easy as pressing a button.

**Good Aspects**

- Compact size makes it easy to store in kitchens of any size.  
- Reversible blade lets you switch between chopping and grinding effortlessly.  
- Dishwasher-safe bowl and lid save precious cleanup time.  
- Comes with a useful spatula and recipe manual that kick-starts meal ideas.  

**Power-Packed Performance**

For such a small machine, this thing holds its own. The Mini Prep Plus boasts 250 watts of power‚Äîplenty of muscle to tackle challenging ingredients. I‚Äôve chopped carrots and celery for soup without the processor even hesitating. However, I noticed it can over-process softer items like tomatoes or herbs if you‚Äôre not careful. With its auto-reversing SmartPower blade, I experimented with different textures and found it particularly outstanding at creating fine crumbs or coarsely chopped vegetables.

**Shortcomings**

- Loud operation, which may annoy sensitive ears during morning prep.   
- Limited to smaller quantities of food due to the 4-cup bowl capacity.  
- May not handle heavy tasks like kneading dough or shredding cheese well.  

**Choppers and Competitive Edge**

You‚Äôve got options in the mini food processor category, but this model stacks up quite well against some of its peers. The KitchenAid Mini Food Processor, for example, also offers portability and convenience but can feel a bit bulky compared to the sleek design of the Mini Prep Plus. Where this product really shines against others is the stainless steel reversible blade‚Äîa feature not all mini processors include. The plastic build of some competitors can feel flimsier too, while this processor strikes a good balance between weight and sturdiness.

**True Value**

Where cost-efficiency is concerned, I‚Äôd say this processor offers a lot of bang for your buck. While prices fluctuate, the durability, multi-functionality, and inclusion of complementary accessories like a handy spatula make it a worthwhile addition to any kitchen. It‚Äôs not a splurge item by any means, but it delivers consistent performance that makes you feel you‚Äôre getting your money‚Äôs worth.

She had blonde hair with some black peekaboo highlights, blue eyes, and this kind of tired, sarcastic expression in most of her videos. Her vibe was alternative, but soft and chill. She used to post a lot of GRWM videos from her college dorm room, usually before class. I think she was studying psychology.

She used to joke about how bad the dorm conditions were, and I remember she‚Äôd say things like ‚Äúignore my pile of clothes, I can‚Äôt do my laundry‚Äù because she didn‚Äôt have access to a washing machine. Eventually she and her roommate moved into an apartment together.

1mhd54g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mhd54g/uncover_how_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_coffee_maker/,Uncover How the OXO Rapid Brewer Coffee Maker Transforms Your Brew Routine Review,"Testing out the **OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer** has been an enlightening addition to my daily coffee routine. As someone who often juggles the demands of remote work and family life, a reliable, fast, and versatile coffee maker is critical. This rapid brewer boasts an impressive ability to deliver rich, concentrated coffee in record time, which initially caught my attention. It turns out the product has its merits, but there are a few considerations worth pointing out too.

**Lightweight and Compact Design**  
What instantly stood out was the brewer's ultra-portable build. The dimensions‚Äî3"" x 3"" x 10.5""‚Äîmake it compact enough to throw in a backpack or purse without weighing you down at just 1.06 pounds. Its matte black design, paired with high-quality Tritan‚Ñ¢ Renew construction, gives a minimalist yet sturdy vibe, making it look sharp on any kitchen counter. This compactness makes it perfect not just for home use but also for travel, which has been a lifesaver during those spontaneous camping trips with my friends.

**Rainmaker Showerhead for Flawless Extraction**  
One feature I genuinely appreciated was the Rainmaker showerhead; it sounds fancy, and rightfully so. The even water distribution across the coffee grounds ensures your coffee comes out balanced and flavorful. I could taste the difference‚Äîit managed to coax the coffee's full-bodied richness better than some high-end electric alternatives I‚Äôve tried. That small detail elevates the brewing experience and even allows you to tweak variables like water amount and temperature to fully dial in your preferred taste.

[Check OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)

**Manual Operation, No Charging Hassles**  
As a manual coffee maker, it eliminates the dependency on electricity or batteries, making it perfect for outdoor adventures, power outages, or even just reducing countertop clutter. Unlike traditional French presses or pod-based brewers that require specific conditions, this hands-on operation felt liberating. It‚Äôs like the brewer encourages you to embrace your inner barista. The locking pump that allows safe storage is another smart touch for portability.

**Dishwasher-Safe Components for Easy Cleaning**  
Nothing ruins a great coffee experience like after-brew cleanup, but thankfully, this brewer eases the burden. Every part except the pump is dishwasher-safe, which is such a blessing after a busy morning or late-night coffee session. However, I noticed that the stainless-steel filter needs a quick rinse to avoid residue buildup; otherwise, it compromises taste over time. Not a huge annoyance, but something worth remembering.

**Versatility Unlocks Endless Options**  
This brewer isn‚Äôt just about coffee; it‚Äôs about creativity. The concentrated coffee it produces can be transformed into an Americano, a creamy latte, Vietnamese cold brew, or even an affogato. I‚Äôve experimented with milk, ice, and water in the recommended 1:2 ratio, and every time, it was a great hit. My kids even joined the fun, making their own iced mocha concoctions without too much mess. The simplicity of operation matches the versatility, so you can craft new coffee drinks with almost zero hassle.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and lightweight for easy portability.  
- Produces robust, concentrated coffee quickly (2 minutes for hot, 5 for cold).  
- No need for disposable filters, as its reusable stainless-steel filter does the job.  
- Safe and easy to clean thanks to dishwasher-safe parts.  

**Critiques**  
- The manual pump action can feel tedious, especially when brewing multiple servings.  
- The stainless-steel filter sometimes traps fine grounds that require careful cleaning.  
- Lack of an insulated carafe means your coffee can cool down quicker if not served immediately.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While the rapid brewer carves its niche, competitors like the AeroPress and Hario v60 offer their own appeal. The AeroPress, though slightly bulkier, provides similar hands-on brewing versatility and produces similarly concentrated coffee that‚Äôs perfect for traveling. The Hario v60, on the other hand, leans more toward pour-over simplicity with a brighter, cleaner flavor. Both options cater to different preferences, but if portability and speedy extraction are top priorities, the rapid brewer definitely holds its own. However, the lack of dependency on disposable filters gives the OXO model a sustainability edge over both.

**True Value**  
At its price point, the brewer sits in the sweet spot between premium home-use coffee makers and budget-conscious portable brewers. You‚Äôre not merely buying a coffee maker; you're investing in a brewing system that adapts to your lifestyle while reducing waste through reusable elements. Considering the flexibility it offers in brewing methods and the satisfaction of never having to queue at Starbucks, it‚Äôs an economical coffee lover's dream.

My wife and I are in the process of building our own specialty coffee brand, with a focus on high-quality beans from Panama.

Over the years, we‚Äôve seen specialty coffee shift from being this carefully crafted art form to something much more mainstream. Our goal is to bring back that original, curated essence, the connection, the craft, and the story behind each cup.

I‚Äôm really curious: what makes you connect with a coffee brand? Is it the origin, the roast style, the story, the packaging, or something else entirely?

For us, we‚Äôre putting a lot of weight on narrative and storytelling. The coffee itself is top-notch, but we believe that pairing it with valuable, engaging information makes it truly stand out.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

I'm looking to expand my social circle with new connections. I've met amazing people, both virtually and IRL from Reddit, but sometimes people ghost and communication tends to fizzle out, so I'm putting myself out there again hoping to find some more great people.

About me: 
I work in the health care industry, though I'm on leave currently. I'm rather analytic, and I enjoy figuring out how the world works, especially the social bits of how people relate with each other. I enjoy good conversation, and a sense of humor. My interests are pretty varied. When I'm indoors, I'm reading a book, listening to an audiobook, or watching an action or thriller series on Netflix. When I'm outdoors, I'm probably on a scenic walk üòÖ Also, I'd love to get someone to share pics of my walk with, and would love to hear about the ""mundane"" things that fill your day too. But I'm just as happy grabbing a coffee as I am exploring a new city.

I'm looking to connect with people who are at least 30 years old and based in the UK. I'm not looking for something NSFW or for suggestive conversation. If we have a good chat online and we click, I'd be open to moving our conversation to phone calls.

If you're also looking for a new friend and think we might get along, send me a message, SKIP THE HI and tell me a bit about yourself. 

Alternative conversation starters. You could pick one
1. If you could safely visit any planet, which planet would you go to?
2. If you no longer had to sleep, how would you spend your sleep hours?
3. What's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you as a teenager?

Currently im 22, but i felt like im in a weird situation here. 

When i was little, i like to go out, making friends trough conversations. But then i get trough hard times. Economy, Bullying and suchs. As those moments passes, im spending more time on books and phone games alone on room. Reaching standard school scores, and making more careful decisions, just like what my asian parents wanted to.

Things happened, and i spent a full gap year at 19 till 20 doing absoulutely nothing but keep playing anime games on my phone and reading novel books. Following my parents around and suchs. A bit of tears seeing my friends already at colleges while im still gap year. 

And now im 22. Spent 2 last years just learning language because my parents drafted me to currently semi europe/asia country college. And NOW they're saying to me:

""Please, make friends""
""Dont think too much about college""
""Be happy"".

Im not mad, im a bit dissapointed that they were hard on me to be a great student, and im commited on it when im still little. 
(But i dont wanna tell em bcs i feel like it l be a bad decisions) 

With little to no communication skill, now i felt lost. Not in terms of knowledge, but experience and existense. 


Now the thing i ask is simple : is there anything i can do to, at least grow up my mental a bit? Because i felt like my friends already being adult while im still stuck here playing like a child.

This is a product meant for people who prioritize spotless garments and unbeatable efficiency. Here‚Äôs my detailed and personal take on this detergent after putting it to daily use.

**Laundry Day Sorted with Superior Cleaning**

I‚Äôll kick this off by saying that white clothes rarely stay white in my home. Between coffee spills and toddler mischief, my whites end up looking more like a faded memory of their former selves. The Miele UltraWhite Powder Detergent, however, has been a game-changer. Its high active oxygen formula made a noticeable difference right from the first load. Stains and spots that I thought were permanent vanished, leaving my whites looking brilliantly fresh. Even on garments with fast-dye colors, I noticed no color bleeding, which is always a relief.

[Ready to snag Miele 10459720? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0746n9y6j/)

**Powerful Yet Gentle Formula**

This powder‚Äôs ability to deliver such results at varying temperatures amazed me. It promises exceptional cleaning at a broad range of temperatures‚Äî68¬∞F to 203¬∞F‚Äîand it delivers. I tested it on a few delicately embroidered white cushions, washing them at a lower temperature, and even they came out immaculate. However, what stood out most is its phosphate-free and paraben-free composition. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that it‚Äôs unscented and gentle on all skin types.

**Ease of Compatibility**

Owning a Miele W1 washing machine meant I had no compatibility issues. The detergent is formulated to work optimally with W1 machines, and that much was evident from the smooth washing cycles and residue-free rinses. However, I also shared the powder with a cousin who uses a non-Miele washing machine, and she reported equally effective results, which speaks to its versatile nature.

**Favorable Attributes**
- High active oxygen formula ensures stain removal without the need for additional boosters.  
- Safe for all washing temperatures, making it ideal for different fabric types.  
- Phosphate-free and paraben-free formula caters to users with sensitive skin.  

**Areas of Concern**

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a few things worth mentioning:  
- On bulkier loads, you might need to adjust the detergent amount for optimal results.  
- The unscented nature may not be everyone‚Äôs preference if they enjoy a lingering fresh laundry smell.  

**A Comparative Look at Peer Products**

Comparing this detergent to leading competitors like Tide or Persil showcases why it stands out. In terms of stain removal, the Miele powder performed equally well but offered an added edge by being unscented and eco-friendly. Tide excels at providing a fresh scent but contains phosphates in some variants. Persil, while solid in performance, often requires pre-treatment for tough stains, which was unnecessary with the Miele detergent. If you‚Äôre someone who prefers no-fuss efficiency and environmental sustainability, this is the better choice.

**Price Worthiness**

I‚Äôve used plenty of detergents over the years, ranging from budget options to premium ones, and the performance of this powder detergent aligns more with premium solutions. While it‚Äôs undoubtedly a higher-end product, the cost-efficiency becomes clear when considering its effectiveness and the 48 washes promised per container. Ultimately, it‚Äôs about whether you value impeccable stain removal and fabric care‚Äîboth of which are delivered consistently here.

CONCEPT

A friendship hangout app where people post or join casual IRL plans based on location, availability, and shared interests.

Example:

* ‚ÄúAnyone up for a coffee after work this Thursday in \[Your Area\]?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúDog walk Sunday morning in \[Neighborhood\]‚Äù
* ‚ÄúNeed a study buddy at the library Tuesday 6‚Äì8PM‚Äù

You could join with a tap, and that‚Äôs it. no swiping, no DMs, no weird flirt-vibes. The goal is to actually meet¬†*nearby people*¬†without all the awkwardness or creepiness of friendship apps that feel like dating apps in disguise.

FEATURES

* Max 10km (or even walkable) radius‚Äîno more matches from across town
* Simple filters: time, vibe, hobbies
* No profiles, no pressure. Just quick hangouts or activity invites.
* Optional post-meet feedback like ‚ÄúWould you hang again?‚Äù

Would anyone here¬†*actually*¬†try something like that?

Also curious:

* What would make it safe + comfortable for you?
* Would you prefer to go 1:1 or in small groups?
* Should there be a way to track who's flaking or showing up?",4,1754312577.0,AppIdeas,3,1.0,False

Looking for some advice. Always thought about becoming an electrician (ideally commercial work) since school, never ended up doing that. Went in to software engineering instead.

Did my A levels, got a degree apprenticeship + 4 years at a top company. Got a full portfolio, and got a first on my degree. The market in this country for software engineers is absolutely terrible: too much competition, competing with AI (since I'm upper junior/lower mid) and if not those jobs, I'm competing with jobs that are being outsourced to India. It's hell.

Now looking at it, I don't want to feel like a number in the system and don't want to just be replaceable at the click of an email, hence me thinking this way. Might seem nuts but it's the truth of being a software engineer at the moment.

How would I even go about retraining? Seems like a very steep uphill climb competing with those fresh out of college with their level 2s / 3s. Doesn't help that people keep calling me mental for wanting to ditch the 9-5 white collar work with free coffee and sitting in a warm office (but those people don't see the constant fear of losing your job, chip-on-the-shoulder managers, stress, lack of health, etc).

**Design and Build Quality**  
Spending my mornings with the Koolatron KKCM12 coffee maker has been like inviting a minimalist friend into my kitchen‚Äîsleek, stylish, and not overly complicated. The silver finish fits well with modern d√©cor, and it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù like some bulkier machines. At 9.3 x 6.5 x 13.5 inches, it blends into the countertop without hogging all the space, which is a relief if you've ever juggled too much kitchen clutter. The glass carafe feels sturdy and can hold up to 12 cups of coffee, which I‚Äôve tested thoroughly on too many groggy mornings. It even includes simple buttons and a clear LCD display for programming, keeping everything user-friendly. However, I did notice it can be a bit wobbly on uneven surfaces, so you might want to test where it sits.  

**Functionality and Features**  
The programmable feature is probably my favorite perk. I‚Äôm someone who relishes not having to fumble with buttons before I‚Äôve had caffeine, and you can set the timer the night before to wake up to freshly brewed coffee. The ‚ÄúPause and Pour‚Äù function has come in handy so many times I‚Äôve lost count. Mid-brew, pulling the carafe out feels like sneaking a cookie before dinner, but the machine allows you to pour a cup before the brewing finishes. It‚Äôs a lifesaver for rushed mornings.

One neat addition is the aroma control. Pressing the 1-4 cup button enables a ‚Äúbold‚Äù mode, brewing a richer and stronger coffee. I‚Äôm not typically into overly strong drinks, but this option pleasantly surprised me when hosting friends who have a taste for intense flavors. The grounds steep a bit longer for a more robust result, reaching a nice balance without bitterness‚Äîunless you overdo the ratio.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Programmable timer simplifies mornings.  
- Aroma control for bolder flavors.  
- Pause-and-pour for mid-brew convenience.  
- Reusable gold-tone filter and charcoal water filter reduce waste.  

**Performance**  
It‚Äôs a reliable little performer, capable of producing consistently good coffee without unnecessary frills. Using regular ground coffee, the drip system extracts flavor efficiently, and the warming plate keeps the pot hot for hours without scorching it. One small hiccup I‚Äôve faced is the carafe spout. It‚Äôs not perfect, and I‚Äôve managed to spill while pouring more than once. Careful tilting is a must.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Carafe design isn‚Äôt the most spill-proof.  
- Lacks advanced features some users may desire, like app connectivity.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing it to others like the Keurig K-Classic or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Koolatron stands out for its simplicity and customization. While pod systems like Keurig excel in convenience, they can‚Äôt quite match the fresh taste from using your own coffee grounds. On the flip side, premium machines like the Breville Precision Brewer offer advanced brewing features but come at a hefty price tag. The Koolatron KKCM12 positions itself somewhere in the middle‚Äîreliable, cost-effective, and feature-packed without being overwhelming to operate.  

**Price Worthiness**  
For what it offers, I feel this coffee machine delivers solid value. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, but the programmable timer, aroma control, and reusable filter justify the price point. It‚Äôs the kind of purchase where you won‚Äôt regret spending just a bit more for better quality.

1mhctkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mhctkd/aitah_for_giving_my_partner_and_mil_cold_treatment/,AITAH for giving my partner and MIL cold treatment,"My partner (32M) and I (30F) have just bought a house and moved in it this weekend. It was an excruciating process as we have had to fast track the process and do a substantial amount of moving all in one weekend. 

He sought out assistance from MIL (60+F) as 3 pairs of hands are better than 2, and also for handling large pieces of furnitures (so equal strengths could be employed on either sides when lifting etc). I am not frail. I am petite but we have managed our extra large couch between my partner and I when we first bought it. MIL is also not too frail but help was thought more for cleaning etc. She joined us the second day. 

Anyway, there had to be a second trip to collect the remainder of our things and it was suggested that I stayed in the new house to start sorting things out while partner and MIL do the last bit of moving. I wanted to go back because I prefer to handle my belongings myself but I‚Äôm also quite sensible so I agree with the plan. The old house is quite a long way away so it meant they had been out from 7am for the better half of the day working together. I started unpacking and cleaning and sorting things out also around 7:30, all on my own, still tired and stressed from all the moving we did on the first day and events leading to it. I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt look the happiest by the time they were back due to reasons above. I was also feeling off and have been feeling lonely a lot lately. 

The first thing that was said to me once back was that I was bringing the energy down. I tried to change my attitude for the better but in my defence, they have been running around together and had coffees to go while I had no access to essentials (we got rid of perishables food, milk, bread, eggs etc and everything else were still in boxes) so I had to soldier on without having anything and on my own. Fast forward to having unloaded all of our stuff, there‚Äôs clearly double the amount of work for me to go through to unpack and sort things out while my partner figured out other things external of the house. In that, neighbours started introducing themselves to him. I have met a couple neighbours the day before, but him and MIL were happily chatting and getting warm welcomes as neighbours kept stopping by. Throughout the day, the pair of them happily tackled his jobs and I was left to my own devices, MIL only coming in to the house to very briefly report that she‚Äôs met the neighbour, that they‚Äôve done this and that, get a drink, then ran off to help partner again. When he sat down, MIL also sat down. The odd time he came to the house, I joked that I hate moving and that we probably should‚Äôve gotten a bigger house (as obv boxes and things were everywhere). 

His eyes widened and said that I was being ungrateful and out of order for saying what I said. I was shocked that he‚Äôd taken what I said out of context. I hadn‚Äôt had him at all to cope with the stresses of moving while him and MIL had had each other to rely on. MIL sought him out at all times, basically partnered with him and only helped him. I feel absolutely and utterly sidelined by all the things that have been happening but I didn‚Äôt want to create drama over what I expected to be a stressful day. So when he said what he said to me, I started to close off and faded in the background (because what do you say to that). I carried on with what I‚Äôm doing but I think that MIL sensed that I was really beginning to seem off and cold so when they both came back to the house she started to ask me what she could do. I said something along the lines of I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to find something there‚Äôs lots to do. 

At some point, she cornered me and said I was making her feel uncomfortable and that if it was upsetting me having her there she‚Äôd leave. I said she better not leave because her leaving would make it seem that I sent her off and that I was being unreasonable after all the help she‚Äôs offered us. This has happened before where somewhat similar circumstances: they are very close that they alienate me and I go quiet then MIL tells him she feels uncomfortable for being ‚Äòin the way‚Äô and partner blames me for making the atmosphere awkward. 

Eventually, after what I assumed was a closed door gossip with one another because I was already feeling indifferent and giving them the cold treatment, partner started to try to involve me. But damage had been done, I really couldn‚Äôt pick up any enthusiasm or energy anymore to feel elated. And I recoiled to the other times they made me feel exactly how I felt that time. Still, I played along with a very neutral energy but nothing more, maybe deteriorating for less. 

I appreciate that they are close and most of the time it bothers me and I put up with it. I get it was mostly just the two of them when he was growing up (dysfunctional background). It‚Äôs definitely not the first time I felt sidelined by the dynamic of their relationship and I tried to get closer to her because.. as they said if you can‚Äôt fight, be it, or something. I thought that would make me feel like I‚Äôm part of the dynamic at the very least. But I would‚Äôve thought that this occasion was primarily about me and my partner, and that she‚Äôd understand that. We spoke about buying a house together and even MIL knew how much moving to this new house meant for the both of us. Yet I have been made to feel like this is partner and MIL‚Äôs world and I‚Äôm just a small part of it. 

The worst is I do not have my family around conveniently, so whilst it is just the two of them in their family, I do not have mine to balance the interaction we both get from either sides of our support because my parents live in another country. 

I felt so anxious last night I had to go and stay in the other bedroom. I didn‚Äôt sleep. I can feel my body is in fight/flight mode. They left together again this morning together to drop off the moving truck and I went to work. He hasn‚Äôt said/texted a word to me at all today. 

TLDR - partner and I moved houses and asked MIL to assist. What should have been a momentous occasion between me and partner was not, because MIL inserted herself in a way that was maybe appropriate or inappropriate, thus I gave them the cold treatment. Also I fear this has revealed to me that the dynamic between partner and MIL is something I will always be secondary to.

His startup, JB‚Äôs Gourmet Spice Blends, which offers high-quality spice blends for all grilling and culinary needs, secured a bulk order of 200 units from Veterans United Home Loans. The deal was made possible through connections he established during the program.

Brack is among several boot camp alumni already seeing success since completing the eight-day program in June.

Mizzou‚Äôs Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans is one of just eight programs of its kind in the country. It relies on local professionals who volunteer their time to lead sessions and mentor the participants.

The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans is headquartered nationally at the D‚ÄôAniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University, which relies on its consortium of university partners to provide the curriculum each year.

Veterans United Foundation has provided more than $1.2 million in funding for the program since 2015 when Mizzou joined the consortium.

Participants from around the country identify funding opportunities, including bootstrapping, loans from the Small Business Administration and introductions to potential investors.

The program also offers a $20,000 annual seed fund, from which the graduates can apply for up to $2,000 in non-equity grants to grow their businesses.

By the time the veterans leave Columbia, they have been exposed to a broad network of experts and support systems. They are also encouraged to find similar resources back home.

Greg Bier, the program‚Äôs executive director, said the Columbia community makes the program distinct. Dozens of local professionals, including small business bankers, digital marketers, grant writers and legal experts, volunteer to lead the workshops.

‚ÄúWhen veterans come here, they don‚Äôt just meet professors with PowerPoint presentations,‚Äù Bier said. ‚ÄúThey meet their potential teammates, mentors and champions.‚Äù

Kelsey Raymond, executive director of entrepreneurship programs, who took over coordination of the program this year, said community involvement is especially meaningful.

‚ÄúThey show up because they believe in what these veterans are trying to do,‚Äù Raymond said.

Support continues after the program ends. Bier and Raymond keep in touch with alumni, offering advice and introductions as needed. Bier said he often meets with past participants over coffee when they‚Äôre in town.

One veteran, a triple amputee who had received significant public support when he was released from the hospital (such as an adaptive home and car), joined the program hoping to start an engraving business.

He completed the residency portion of the program at Mizzou with two new projects and a renewed sense of purpose.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt want pity,‚Äù Bier said. ‚ÄúHe wanted to provide for his family and feel like he had a mission again.‚Äù

With about 70% of the program‚Äôs 157 total alumni currently operating businesses, EBV is already exceeding expectations. Raymond hopes to enhance the program in the future by adding networking events with local entrepreneurs and tracking long-term business outcomes like job creation.

‚ÄúAt the end of the day, our goal is to make sure every veteran who comes here says, ‚ÄòThat was the best use of my time,‚Äô‚Äù Raymond said. ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre not just building businesses. They‚Äôre building something that lasts.‚Äù",1,1754312374.0,mizzou,0,1.0,False

I used to be 129, then 180, then 260. Then suddenly I was 300lbs. I‚Äôve been vaping since I was 14. I quit 2 weeks ago because my boyfriend asked me too and because the timeline just worked.(I moved away from my smoker family and cut off my mom). So I wasn‚Äôt near anyone vaping. Well I have asthma. I blame myself and my mom and sister were the ones buying me them. My sister didn‚Äôt until I was older. Well, I for 40+ hours, graduated at 16, associates at 19, and now getting my bachelors in science-nursing. So I thought to myself, I‚Äôve tried to lose weight in the past, how hypocritical am I to be a nurse and not be healthy? So I am throwing the vape down for good. But my issue is, since moving away I‚Äôve lost baggage but also gained grief. I‚Äôm tired of being overweight. I‚Äôm not a lazy person, I work 12-8 AM, my partner and I split mostly 50/50 and try to Atleast. We have I dog who‚Äôs very spoiled. The issue is my bf is heavy too. Nothing wrong with that, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô5 and 300 and it looks scrumptious on him. It‚Äôs another problem we have is overeating, not healthy food, and stuff alike. My biggest issue is I‚Äôd eat then starve when I was the ages of 14-17. My bf got me out of that. I have IBS, GERD, Asthma, MDD and anxiety. And I wanna let it go. I want to be on a diet that handles my GERD. And IBS. My anxiety is managed atm and so is my MDD. I‚Äôve grown quite a lot. So my next question is working out with Asthma. What would you guys reccomend. Every time I ask my bf about different lifestyle choices we both try and fail or he just doesn‚Äôt want too. We can‚Äôt afford to be buying multiple different foods. I‚Äôm thinking about going gluten free unfortunately. I‚Äôm dairy free other than cream for coffee 2 times a week( couldn‚Äôt give it up, not bc I‚Äôm big back but because it genuinely one of my favorite hobbies) and Greek yogurt( it‚Äôs a obsession ofc) how do I go about this?

Question 1. Asking my bf to try a diet or support me?

Question 2. What diets have worked for people with IBS

Question 3. Does meditation work for you?

1.It would've make both sides use environments minimum 1 time, not plants 1 time and zombies 2 times. For example nebula: you played tp zombie on zombie stage; plants played, idk, pear pearadise and used it; now you cover it with nebula and did that disgusting buried treasure combo; after the battle you can repeat it on zombie stage performing that combo again, and plant player can't stop it, he have to wait his turn to cover it. Now, if environments were played on zombie stage: you place nebula and now have to use all of it, because plants will cover it next turn, but they still can use their environment on one turn. In that scenario both sides have equal use for environments.
2.Yes, you might think that some environments would be useless now, like lasers, since plants can now cover it, and zombies can't even make use of it, since it won't make it to combat stage and most bonus attacks come from tricks, but what actually happened is that it switched position with coffee bean and other combat effect environments, and it's still more fair than it is now. Zombies can place lasers in trick stage and Plants can do nothing about it, but if plants play coffee beans or force field, zombies still has removals to play.
3.It solves problem with zombies environments being much cheaper, without changing any environment on both sides.
I think it's solves the problem where plants have to pray every turn that zombies don't have an environment, because if the do, all invested suns going in waste. For a stat giving environments it's tableturn in favor of plants, and now zombies have to pray, but not much since they still have a tricks.
I want your opinion about it.

* ‚ÄúDog walk Sunday morning in \[Neighborhood\]‚Äù
* ‚ÄúNeed a study buddy at the library Tuesday 6‚Äì8PM‚Äù

* Max 10km (or even walkable) radius‚Äîno more matches from across town
* Simple filters: time, vibe, hobbies
* No profiles, no pressure. Just quick hangouts or activity invites.
* Optional post-meet feedback like ‚ÄúWould you hang again?‚Äù

1mhcn33,https://www.reddit.com/r/red_muppets/comments/1mhcn33/green_shoots_for_man_utd_or_another_false_dawn/,Green shoots for Man Utd or another false dawn? - Simon Stone,"Manchester United have been so underwhelming, so erratic and talked so many good games over the past decade without delivering, it is sensible to watch closely to see if any green shoots of recovery continue to grow before passing judgement.
Ruben Amorim is wise to this.

He knows his searingly honest appraisal of United and his welcome openness in outlining how he is trying to improve things will count for absolutely nothing if they lose to Arsenal at Old Trafford in their Premier League season opener on 17 August.

He also knows United tend to attract extreme reactions, and said as much after Sunday's 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta confirmed his side as winners of the four-team Premier League Summer Series.
""It's normal in our club,"" he said.
""If you play well, they will say we play really well, if it's on the opposite side, it's the same thing.""

After four minutes of speaking to the press - not even a sixth of the time he spent with travelling UK journalists in Chicago on Friday - he was gone, choosing instead to watch the non-starting members of his squad - Joshua Zirkzee, Noussair Mazraoui, Andre Onana and Lisandro Martinez were not involved at any point - do a full training session on the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch.
Woe betide anyone who didn't meet Amorim's standards.

It is a big part of Amorim's coaching strategy to treat his players like adults. This seems sensible, although this is football we are talking about and even in Sir Alex Ferguson's day one player - who is still close to the club - turned up for a European trip with all his house keys, having locked the door with the rest of his family still inside, and had to sheepishly ask another employee to go back and let them out.

The sight of United players wandering round Chicago after training - either for a coffee, a bite to eat or a browse through the very expensive shops that make up the 'magnificent mile', without being accompanied by security, suggested a healthy dose of normality, which, as Amorim makes clear, comes with responsibility.
Players posed for numerous selfies - plenty of fans asked and no-one refused - when they were out and about around the team hotel. Letting the dressing room run the dressing room served Ferguson well.

It has made for a more relaxed environment. This is a contrast to the prescriptive approach of Erik ten Hag, who punished players if they were late for meetings.
That is not to say punishments don't exist in Amorim's world.
Defeat in the small-sided games at the end of training means having to pack away the training equipment. And in his revealing chat on Friday, Amorim said poor performance in training is identified and shown to the entire group rather than the individual concerned being singled out for a quiet word.

There are other subtleties too. Training on day one was at 8am to allow a transition through a six-hour time zone swap, in the knowledge Amorim will have his squad back together at Carrington on Wednesday before Saturday lunchtime's friendly with Fiorentina - disruption caused by a change in time zones should be easier.
It means Amorim was getting up even earlier to do his morning exercise, a run and weights, before the players arrived.

Training itself consisted of more intense gym work, lasting up to an hour, and walking through game scenarios - which Amorim takes and club media are not allowed to film.
Information is kept to key points rather than risk overload, where no messages get through. It is the general framework Amorim is trying to create. The players, he feels, should have the intelligence to make decisions themselves in key moments.

This means not all the key work takes place on the pitches. Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes does the set-pieces and drill work. The previous tradition of double sessions to build fitness have been ditched.
In addition, some of the running being asked of the players has been disguised. Two shooting drill stations were created at training but the gap between them was widened so more energy was expended to get between the two.

On the surface, all this seems positive. Certainly, reports from inside the club say the sports science team were delighted with the numbers from the early training sessions after Amorim's players returned for the start of pre-season on 7 July.

This, they reasoned, suggested the players had stuck to a pretty detailed and strict fitness programme to work on during their time off.
This is Manchester United, so there were some commercial appearances, but they have reduced from previous tours.

In fact, potentially the most significant commercial event as far as the club was concerned had no player involvement at all as Lord Coe, chair designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) for the Old Trafford regeneration project, was part of a delegation who addressed an audience of Wall Street investment banks and US financiers in New York to try to generate interest in helping to fund the planned ¬£2bn new stadium project.

The fact neither Coe nor chief operating officer Collette Roche, who spoke at length to travelling media about the stadium plans in Los Angeles 12 months earlier, met the press this time suggests strongly nothing significant has changed and the feeling is growing United will not meet an initial five-year timeline minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke of in March.
That is not Amorim's concern, of course.

He must deliver on the pitch. And to that end, United did look much better than last season.
It was obvious the much-discussed three-man defence splits when Amorim's team have the ball so, when the build-up begins, the right and left-sided defenders operate as normal central defenders with the middle man of the three - Matthijs de Ligt is in pole position for that role - moves into midfield alongside the deeper of the two chosen for those jobs.
Matheus Cunha definitely brings more invention to Amorim's attack and Amad Diallo, if selected, is a massive danger offensively at right wing-back, even if questions are asked defensively.

It is clear Amorim feels he can find an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, even if many would argue a better use of the funds United do have would be to find someone who can bring physicality and energy to midfield.
Watching the industry of Bournemouth's Alex Scott emphasises it is a significant weakness in Amorim's squad.
Nevertheless, as tours go, this has been a fairly calm one. Amorim's group of players, in general, seem happy enough and the positive spirit needed for any team to be successful does exist.
Yet the reality of modern football is that everything in seen through, and judged by, the prism of results.

The walk through might be an advancement. If United win it will be seen that way. If they lose it will be written off as a terrible idea - even though it is the exactly the same process.
Conceding the winning goal to Tottenham in the Europa League final through a flick off Brennan Johnson - that took a deflection at close range off Luke Shaw and then squeezed in at the corner despite Onana's desperate attempt to keep it out - has nothing to do with training and everything to do with the small margins managers across the league talk about.

I'm looking to expand my social circle with new connections. I've met amazing people, both virtually and IRL from Reddit, but sometimes people ghost and communication tends to fizzle out, so I'm putting myself out there again hoping to find some more great people.

About me: 
I work in the health care industry, though I'm on leave currently. I'm rather analytic, and I enjoy figuring out how the world works, especially the social bits of how people relate with each other. I enjoy good conversation, and a sense of humor. My interests are pretty varied. When I'm indoors, I'm reading a book, listening to an audiobook, or watching an action or thriller series on Netflix. When I'm outdoors, I'm probably on a scenic walk üòÖ Also, I'd love to get someone to share pics of my walk with, and would love to hear about the ""mundane"" things that fill your day too. But I'm just as happy grabbing a coffee as I am exploring a new city.

I'm looking to connect with people who are at least 30 years old and based in the UK. I'm not looking for something NSFW or for suggestive conversation. If we have a good chat online and we click, I'd be open to moving our conversation to phone calls.

If you're also looking for a new friend and think we might get along, send me a message, SKIP THE HI and tell me a bit about yourself. 

Alternative conversation starters. You could pick one
1. If you could safely visit any planet, which planet would you go to?
2. If you no longer had to sleep, how would you spend your sleep hours?
3. What's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you as a teenager?

Read the following article.

Source: [https://nos.nl/artikel/2577544](https://nos.nl/artikel/2577544)

Translated with [Deepl.com](http://Deepl.com)



# Swiss upset by unexpectedly high U.S. import tariffs

Concerns in Zurich. The Swiss stock exchange SMI opened this morning with a loss of 1.8 percent. It is due to the announced US import tariffs of as much as 39 percent. The unexpectedly high rate puts the Swiss government in crisis mode. An economic crisis is feared, although deep red figures are not yet forthcoming and the stock market has already recovered somewhat.

Switzerland, along with Brazil, Syria, Myanmar and Laos, is among the countries with the highest U.S. import tariffs. The upset is great. The Swiss feel unprecedentedly punished by their, after the EU, most important trading partner. Nota bene on the national holiday, Aug. 1, the news was announced.

On Thursday, the import duties go into effect. Before then, Bern hopes to reach an agreement with the Americans. That too will limit the loss of the stock market somewhat. Still, expectations are low. After all, reconstructions from Swiss media show that previous negotiations went disastrously.

**Escalated telephone conversation**  
A day before the announcement of the import tariffs, Federal President Karin Keller-Sutter had a telephone conversation with Trump. According to the Tages-Anzeiger, he kept her waiting for 10 minutes and then she encountered a president in a bad mood. The Swiss proposal of a 10 percent levy was waved away.

Keller-Sutter tried to explain to Trump why there is a lopsided trade balance, according to Swiss newspapers. She allegedly came across to Trump as a ‚Äúpedantic woman,‚Äù reconstructions sound. Eventually, her team received a text message from Trump's entourage suggesting they end the conversation ‚Äúbefore it escalated further.‚Äù The conversation then ended.

Just two hours later, the import tariff was announced: 39 percent, significantly higher than the expected 31 percent and well above the desired 10 percent. The Swiss suspect that the rate was revised upward on a whim by the taunted Trump.

**Watches and coffee cups**  
Switzerland exports many luxury and high-end products to the U.S., but imports relatively few American goods. In the hard-to-follow economic logic of U.S. President Trump, that lopsided trade balance must be redressed by heavily taxing Swiss products.

Watchmakers Swatch and Richemont are expected to be hit hardest. The pharmaceutical industry and food group Nestl√© with its Nespresso cups will also be affected. Service providers and banks such as UBS, on the other hand, will hardly suffer, causing the red stock market figures to fall slightly.

Keller-Sutter faces strong criticism from her opponents. The federal president is said to have acted naively and with hubris. There is also criticism that the federal government reacted too slowly. Emergency consultations on an appropriate response will begin only today.

**Contrast with EU**   
The 39 percent import tariff is in stark contrast to trade agreement negotiated by the European Union. The EU gets ‚Äúonly‚Äù 15 percent imposed, with some exceptions. Whereas the EU was able to negotiate as one strong bloc, the Swiss stood alone against the Americans.

The Swiss trade association Handel Schweiz fears a ‚Äútrade catastrophe,‚Äù now that the Swiss are at a merciless disadvantage compared to their EU neighbors. Other employers' associations also fear that Swiss industry is at risk. Tens of thousands of layoffs are feared.

The question is how Switzerland can avert an economic crisis. The federal government is considering announcing hefty investments and seeking further rapprochement with the EU. In particular, the largest governing party, the nationalist SVP, is known as a fierce critic of economic treaties with Brussels.

For now, the federal government is staying away from retaliatory measures such as halting the purchase of F-35 jet fighters. Hopes remain pinned on reaching an agreement before the import duties take effect on Thursday. Until then, the Swiss stock market waits tensely.",10,1754311745.0,europeanunion,3,0.78,False

Should I start with something versatile like an AeroPress or French Press? Or is it worth jumping straight to a V60 for pour-over? Moka pot?  Do I need a dedicated cold brew maker, or should I just DIY with a jar ?


Basically, if you were in my shoes, what‚Äôs your go-to setup that covers these styles? Bonus if it‚Äôs beginner-friendly but good enough to grow with.

Thanks üôè

1mhcfpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1mhcfpf/3_essential_tips_to_master_spanish_or_any_language/,3 Essential Tips to Master Spanish ‚Äî Or Any Language,"Here are 3 tips for learning Spanish or any other language that will help you along the way. Try not to make the mistakes mentioned, and follow these suggestions consistently. If you do, you‚Äôll see real progress.

1 . **Treat language learning like a marathon, not a sprint.**

One of the biggest mistakes is chasing quick results. YouTube, Instagram, and ads love to promise things like ‚Äúfluency in 3 months‚Äù or ‚Äú10 phrases that will make you speak like a native.‚Äù It sounds great, but it‚Äôs mostly marketing. Real language learning takes time, patience, and flexibility, especially if you‚Äôre starting from scratch and not living in a Spanish-speaking country.

Fluency doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhappen.‚Äù It‚Äôs a gradual build-up. You‚Äôre not only learning words, you‚Äôre absorbing emotion, tone, humor, and cultural nuance. At first, progress may feel painfully slow. You learn and forget. You repeat and still get confused. But then, at some point, it gets easier and you realize all that effort wasn‚Äôt for nothing. You start understanding movies. You speak without translating in your head. The right word pops up mid-conversation. No, it doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but suddenly you notice: you‚Äôve reached a solid level in the language.

So don‚Äôt set unrealistic expectations. Instead, commit to practicing every day for an amount of time that‚Äôs sustainable, something that pushes you, but doesn‚Äôt burn you out. What matters most isn‚Äôt how much you do, but how often you show up.

And don‚Äôt compare your journey to others‚Äô. ¬†Everyone learns at their own pace, but the ones who win are simply the ones who don‚Äôt give up.

2 . **Don‚Äôt focus on just one skill, develop your language from all angles.**

Many beginner learners make the same mistake: they focus only on what they‚Äôre best at or what feels the most ‚Äúeffective.‚Äù Some people listen to podcasts for hours but are too afraid to speak. Some write well but struggle to understand spoken language. Others memorize grammar rules but never actually use them in conversation.

The truth is ‚Äî all the skills are connected. If you read a lot, you naturally build up your vocabulary, which helps you write and speak better. If you listen often, you improve your ability to understand real speech and intonation, making it easier to speak. When you speak, you activate the language. And when you write, you organize your thoughts and reinforce what you know.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to keep things balanced and try to develop all four core skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) more or less equally. It also keeps your learning experience fun, doing the same thing every day gets boring fast.

Here are a few tips for practicing each of the 4 core skills:

1 . Listening

Surround yourself with natural language. The best way to train your ear is by listening to real conversations, whether face-to-face or online. Talk to native speakers, watch interviews, listen to music, podcasts, YouTube channels, or news. Focus on voices, tones, slang, and rhythm, they help you tune in to the real way people speak, not just textbook phrases.

2 . Speaking

You don‚Äôt need to be fluent to start speaking, you need to speak to become fluent. Talk out loud to yourself, describe your day as you go, or join online language exchanges. Record yourself and listen back, it‚Äôs a great way to catch patterns and mistakes. Speaking activates the language and builds confidence faster than you think.

3 . Reading

Reading strengthens vocabulary and grammar naturally. Start with short and simple things ‚Äî children‚Äôs books, comics, or translated versions of stories you already know. Once you're comfortable, explore blogs, articles, and eventually full-length novels. Reading helps you see how the language flows and builds your inner ‚Äúlanguage sense.‚Äù

4. Writing is the best way to slow down and organize your thoughts. Keep a short daily journal, even just 3‚Äì4 sentences about your day. Write captions for photos, comment on Spanish posts, or text with native speakers. You could even try writing poetry or short dialogues, creativity makes the process more fun and memorable.

3. ¬†**Immerse in the culture**

Immersion in a language isn‚Äôt just about practice and listening. It‚Äôs also about getting to know the culture.

In Spanish courses, cultural topics often come up and that‚Äôs not by accident. Without culture, the language can feel dry and artificial. But when you learn about traditions, watch movies, listen to music, and try the food of a country, whether it‚Äôs Spain or somewhere in Latin Americ, you begin not just to understand the language, but to feel it.

Take the word ‚Äúmerendar‚Äù, for example. A textbook might translate it simply as ‚Äúto have a snack,‚Äù but in reality, it‚Äôs a whole tradition deeply connected to culture. In Spain and Latin America, ‚Äúmerendar‚Äù is almost like a ritual: after school or work, people gather with family or friends, drink coffee or hot chocolate, eat something sweet, and just relax. It‚Äôs about comfort, connection, and social time. When you understand these kinds of cultural details, you don‚Äôt just learn to speak the language, you learn to feel it.

Cultural immersion makes learning more fun and engaging. It helps you fall in love with the language and stay motivated. Even if you don‚Äôt live in a Spanish-speaking country, you can still join local events, talk with native speakers online or explore Spanish-speaking communities in your area.

This isn‚Äôt just an extra layer of learning ‚Äî it‚Äôs the heart of it. The more connected you are to the culture, the more naturally the language will flow!

It ended due to reasons relating to codependency, insecurity and inability to communicate. We were in no contact on and off throughout the past couple years, had our falling outs and reconciliations, and sent ‚Äúhappy birthdays‚Äù, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äôs‚Äù and had the occasional coffee meetup in between. We both said had so much love for each other and that we always wanted the best for each other. 

During the time we‚Äôve been broken up we‚Äôve both had our fair share of seeing and dating other people. I am currently still in therapy to try and grow from what happened. There was a point where I truly felt like I had moved on but there was always a small part that still thought about my ex. 

It was recently that I saw him out in public and we reconnected and tried to re-kindle things after that. We admitted that despite seeing other people we still felt like we couldn‚Äôt find a connection like what we had. I truly thought it was going to work out this time because things seemed different. However, things didn‚Äôt work out this time due to my jealousy getting in the way and he was unwilling to meet me halfway and respect my relationship boundaries (this is a whole other story in itself).

We ended things amicably and still said we loved each other so much and wanted to be friend and keep in touch. One part of me wants to hold onto this feeling of hope, especially since we came so close to making it work this time. It seemed like fate was on our side. Also the way we were ending things was along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is going to work right now‚Äù and ‚Äúthe timing isn‚Äôt right‚Äù which makes me think it could work out one day again. But the other part of me feels like I‚Äôll never be able to move on unless I fully put this down. Is love supposed to be this hard?

Summary: In the soft rot of whatever came after, a guy wears a busted radio helmet and listens to transmissions from his future self while planting weird little messages in the dirt. His cat, Burger, used to translate but gave that up - now he mostly reads and digs things up. Time‚Äôs bent, language grows like weeds, and meaning doesn‚Äôt so much arrive as it just shows up and sits there. This is a story about memory, gardening, and things falling apart in ways that almost make sense.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Rotten Fruit and Radio Waves: Part One
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I wake up and feel the heat already heavy on the sheets. Sunlight trickles through the blinds, and I squint at the familiar clutter of coffee cups on the nightstand. In the kitchen, the coffee maker gurgles like it always does, and I fill the red ceramic mug half full with cream. Outside, the air smells of damp earth and summer‚Äôs approaching.


I step into my garden after the first cup. Burger, my cat with a permanently amused expression, follows on tippy-toes behind me. The tomato plants lean toward the morning light. I pat the towel on my shoulder and prune a stray leaf from the rose bush. It used to be grandma‚Äôs rose, but at some point it left the family and came to me in a ceramic pot.


The backyard is quiet except for the hum of bees and the distant leak of a sprinkler. Burger pauses by the mint patch and flops down. I pour water carefully around the squash vines. Sometimes I swear the squash whispers back, but I told myself I was just hearing the garden spout its own stories. I glance at a photograph pinned to the porch post: me, shaved head in a transplant ward, a clipboard in hand, my grandfather smiling. He‚Äôs dead now, too, and somehow there‚Äôs no one here to congratulate me on remembering birthdays or anniversaries.


The porch swings a little as an August breeze finds it. I sweep off the tiny white stones and sit to drink my coffee while Burger yawns and stretches. The mug is warm in my hands, and I feel the familiar tug of loneliness. I used to share this porch with someone who called me love. Now I share it only with Burger and the cat hair in my laundry.


The humid Texas morning blooms into heat. I drink the last of the coffee as Burger rubs against my leg. A thunderhead rolls in from the west. I notice the hairs on my forearm prickle: rain is coming. I don‚Äôt move, watching the sky darken. The first drop is a diamond ping on the porch roof.


Then time stops. I know the air has frozen but I keep moving forward until I feel a sensation of stillness settle around me. The rain hangs in the sky, straight threads of water caught like needles. Even Burger pauses mid-step, his tail locking in the air. The whole world looks gilded, like a photo someone forgot to develop.


Burger speaks then. The cat opens his mouth and breathes words: ‚ÄúEverything is new. You just forget it faster now.‚Äù The voice is low and pleased, coming from the cat as if from a stranger. I blink at him.
I say nothing. I lean down and scratch behind his ears instead. He purrs and nudges my hand. The warm weight of him reminds me to stay steady.


After a moment I pry my face back to the open air. The rain is starting again, tipping down straight and fast. The world moves again; a rush of new wetness and solid ground where it should be. I slip back inside without telling anyone about the cat‚Äôs sermon.


My notebook lies open on the kitchen table, a new page waiting. On it I scribble a line: It rained at the same time an old voice seemed to speak. I finish my coffee. The words feel strange and incomplete, but I write them anyway.


I set the mug in the sink and let the warm water run. The room smells like damp coffee and old paper. I sit back down and lean my head on my folded arms, looking out the sliding glass door at the small, wet garden. Burger is settled on his mat by the door, cleaning his face methodically.
My eyes drift closed. The afternoon sun has passed west, and my shadow is long on the cracked sidewalk. I remember what it‚Äôs like to listen to the earth for answers. It‚Äôs quiet, still early, but something has shifted in my skin. I sit up, hearing the promise of more rain on the wind.


I gather my mug and a day-old plate of toast from the counter. I rinse them under the tap, listening to the drip. I notice a lone beer can behind the sink; I didn‚Äôt know I had one. I must have forgotten to throw it out last week. Drinking didn‚Äôt fix my memories, it just made them hazier, so nowadays I keep only coffee around.
Burger follows my steps into the kitchen. I scratch his head absently. ‚ÄúI should clean up more,‚Äù I mutter to myself. The floor is sticky from spilled cola I didn‚Äôt bother wiping last night. These small cluttered tasks feel comforting in their predictability.


I put on a light jacket as I prepare to head out again. Rain hasn‚Äôt arrived yet, but the air is heavy and still. The neighborhood is quiet; even the mailman is likely hiding from the heat. I open the front door and take a deep breath. There, on the doorstep, is my old watering can - dented and green - just as I left it. I carry it to the garden one more time, because maybe I‚Äôve learned something: rituals are the only things that hold what is new in place.
Outside, the rain starts again, soaking the earth with each plop. I listen to the plinking of water on leaves. In my childhood, my adoptive mother used to say that rain washes away memories and leaves only the important ones. I wonder if that was true. Was there something important here I have forgotten?
The garden looks brighter after the shower. I kneel by the squash plant and tuck my hands into the soil. It feels cool, alive. I bury a scrap of notebook paper beneath the leaves, something I scribbled in the margins: Lost things grow here. Maybe it‚Äôs just clay, maybe it‚Äôs ritual. I brush dirt from my fingers and let the rest of the page flutter away.

I was always polite yet neutral towards him until the separation, when I noticed the way he looked at me felt different, and that perhaps he had been holding something back. And before you come at me, hell yes I‚Äôm going through with the divorce, my ex is a shitty person who I never should have married to begin with. Divorce laws are intense in my state (in Arkansas you need a 18 month separation first) but the marriage is over. 

About my crush - I think he embodies a lot of the stereotypical sag traits. He‚Äôs charming, funny, and effortlessly confident. He‚Äôs refreshingly direct and honest. He seems to hold everyone at an arm‚Äôs length while at work, but still sits and chats with me when his shift is up. When we talk, the conversation turns real deep real quick, which is fascinating and fun for me. He‚Äôs a deeply interesting person. He also seems endlessly optimistic (toxi-posi maybe?) and is very comfortable disagreeing with people or opposing their views, which makes conversation more interesting to me, and makes me trust him to be honest. Got a real cute butt, too. 

My biggest concern is - how prone are y‚Äôall to a dismissive avoidant attachment style? While his confidence and honestly would normally indicate to me he‚Äôs capable of a secure attachment, he‚Äôs confided in me a bit about how he grew up, which was objectively rough/neglected. He also seems to stay single. And I‚Äôm wary of avoidants now. I really like deep connections and emotional/physical intimacy, 

Also - y‚Äôall okay with curvy girls?? If not I‚Äôm just gonna give up now, hah. ",4,1754311206.0,Sagittarians,5,1.0,False

1mhc8rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mhc8rz/does_the_keurig_kslim_coffee_maker_truly_offer/,Does the Keurig K-Slim Coffee Maker Truly Offer Convenience and Quality?,"Testing out the Keurig 5000376527 has been a pretty interesting journey for me. I drink a lot of coffee‚ÄîI mean, can‚Äôt-function-without-it kind of dependency here‚Äîso I was eager to see if this sleek, compact setup could handle the demands of my caffeine-intensive lifestyle. Let‚Äôs just say, it performed admirably, but I did have a few nitpicks to keep it real.

**Design and Space-Saving Awesomeness**  
Right out of the box, I could tell this coffee maker meant business. The compact design, standing at just over 13 inches high and 8 inches wide, is a game-changer for someone like me who‚Äôs perpetually battling for counter space. It fit snugly between my toaster oven and blender, looking all sleek with its matte black finish. The style factor is on point‚Äîit‚Äôs minimalist yet still feels modern. Moving it around isn‚Äôt a hassle either, thanks to its lightweight 7.85-pound build. But heads up, it might wobble a little if you‚Äôre over-enthusiastic while inserting pods.  

**BREWING PERFORMANCE: SPEED MATTERS**  
This coffee maker had me at ‚Äúunder a minute.‚Äù I barely have time in the morning to decide what tie matches my pants, and this thing has me sipping coffee before my brain fully wakes up. Using K-Cup pods, it whips up a beautiful brew in 6, 8, or 10-ounce sizes. The 6-ounce setting is my go-to because I like my coffee bold enough to practically glare at me. The Smart Start feature felt like a lovely touch too‚Äîit heats and brews in one go. No fiddling around while waiting for it to warm up, which is nice because time wasted before caffeine is unacceptable in my books.  

[Check Keurig 5000376527 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)  

**User Experience: Easy Peasy Buttons**  
The interface is as simple as it gets. You‚Äôve got basic buttons, and nothing too flashy or complicated‚Äîjust insert a pod, press the size you want, and watch it work its magic. It‚Äôs practically foolproof. My teenage nephew tried it once when he was over, and even he managed not to screw it up. However, some coffee lovers might find the lack of advanced programming features limiting. If you like to nerd out over brew strengths and timings, this might feel a little too basic.

**Highlights**  
- Occupies very little space with its slim, compact design.  
- Heats and brews in one seamless step, thanks to Smart Start.  
- Offers multiple sizes (6, 8, 10 oz.) to cater to varying caffeine needs.  
- Removable 36-ounce water reservoir makes refills easier than ever.  

**Negatives**  
- Can feel slightly flimsy during use if you‚Äôre heavy-handed.  
- Lacks advanced programming options for customization fanatics.  

**A Reservoir Built for Convenience**  
The water reservoir was a pleasant surprise. Holding 36 ounces, it saves you from annoying multiple refills during busy mornings. For someone like me, who goes back for refills after the first cup like it‚Äôs a reflex, this feature is gold. Plus, it‚Äôs removable, so cleaning and refilling aren‚Äôt a chore. I did notice you need to handle it gently to avoid splashes, but that‚Äôs hardly a dealbreaker.  

**Energy Efficiency and Hot Water Bonus**  
This energy-efficient champ automatically shuts off two hours after your last brew. Considering how often I forget to turn things off, this feature basically saves me from myself. Oh, and it can even dispense hot water, which I tested by making ramen noodles once. Not its primary purpose, of course, but hey‚Äîoptions!  

**Competing Brands**  
While it stacks up well against other compact coffee makers, comparisons to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and Nespresso Vertuo are unavoidable. The Hamilton Beach model has a dual brewing system for both pods and ground coffee, which beats the Keurig if you‚Äôre a fan of versatility. On the other hand, the Nespresso Vertuo offers impressive foam capabilities for a higher price‚Äîbut its pod system is more restrictive. Keurig wins in simplicity, speed, and ease of use, and it offers a wider variety of compatible pods without locking you into a single brand ecosystem.  

**Quality for Price**  
Is it worth the cost? I‚Äôd argue yes, though it certainly falls in the category of ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get.‚Äù Don‚Äôt expect advanced features or espresso-level performance. For its price, you‚Äôre paying for space efficiency, convenience, and reliable daily functionality. It‚Äôs perfect for busy households, small kitchens, or even office use where lots of people need their coffee, STAT.

I'm planning to upgrade the full setup at some stage but starting with a grinder as Im led to believe that's most important. I mostly make 1-2 milk drinks at a time once or twice a day, with the occasional 4/5 at when entertaining 

So would I be able to get a new grinder and continue pulling the shots on my barista express or would that defeat the point of getting a new grinder?

I generally like a light to medium roast for me espresso and will be using it almost exclusively for espresso with maybe the odd aeropress or v60. Does this impact whether I should go for conical or flat burrs?

So starting from the very beginning we matched on a dating app twice but he blocked me both then after the second time he followed my TikTok and I gave him a chance again (yes I realized now that was probably a mistake after he blocked me the other two times for no reason) so our dates for 2 months were car dates just sitting in his car talk which was kind of frustrating especially because he said I never got dressed up which I didn‚Äôt because he‚Äôd pick me up before or after work which I worked 12hr shift at the time so I was always in my scrubs so it was kind of hard to have the effort to change and do my hair and makeup after already being tired. 

Anyway I ended up getting sick of it because I‚Äôd ask to go to his but he‚Äôd say no because he doesn‚Äôt take anyone to his because of stalkers because his ex used to stalk him until she went to jail. I understand but once it hit close to the two month mark I kind of got tired of sitting in a car for an hour. Also I couldn‚Äôt take him to mine because my roommates had a no guest rule since they had a baby which I wanted to respect but he lived alone. 

I ended up blocking him because I felt it was a waste of time to just sit in the car for an hour and never even get dinner. So a month or so later he adds my TikTok again and I decided to text him asking why and he said he wanted to apologize so I listened and we saw each other again and went on actual dates. We would go to his and go out to eat. 

The first red flag came when his ex showed up one day before one of our dates and he called me freaking out while I was getting our coffee so I left the coffee line and rushed to his because he was having a panic attack and when I got there she was gone but she left a not saying she wanted to apologize and she put her number I had a feeling he would call her but he said he wanted nothing to do with her ever again and he hated her but I had a bad gut feeling. That weekend I went to a friends graduation and we shared locations which I saw nothing out of the ordinary except he was at the park which was weird but I had a gut feeling he was seeing her but I told myself I was overreacting then me and my friends drank yes I know I‚Äôm underage but I was sort of responsible I ended up getting really drunk and high then one of the guys there tried forcing me to do stuff but I left right away and got in my car and drove intoxicated af because I knew how I get when drunk and high and didn‚Äôt want to do something I‚Äôd regret later on and drove and I almost crashed 5 times and I felt so bad I started crying. He had gotten drunk that same night I found out later on which caused him to cancel our plans but later the next night he called telling me he went and saw her which I started crying because I realized my gut feeling was right he said they didn‚Äôt do anything and I believed him. He said he‚Äôd block her and I asked him to because I was insecure yes I know I‚Äôll get hate for being insecure and in a relationship and told to not date if I‚Äôm too insecure. 

Anyway I found out right before we went to a trip to Mexico he had unblocked her and was texting her because she texted me but before I texted her back I asked him I don‚Äôt yell or hit I just asked and he lied for about an hour and kept changing his story until he finally told me the truth that after his going away party he got really drunk and went to see her which again I had a gut feeling that same night especially once I saw his location and before I get hate for checking I was checking it because I got him a hat with his name engraved on it to give to him and I wanted to give it to him after his party especially since I knew what time it ended I checked but saw it at a random location and asked him where he was the next day he stopped sharing his location and so did I because I had the rule if he stops sharing I do to. Come to find out he went to see her because she ended up telling me and so did he before she did because he knew she would tell me. I might be delusional but he told me he didn‚Äôt sleep with her and I believed him and I made him block her on everything and even told her to reach out if he texted her again. We went on the Mexico trip the next day but more things came to light that after one of our first trips and fights he texted her saying he loved her and missed her and wished I was her saying he wanted to marry her. Yes I should have left sooner I know but I was dumb and in love and still am. We fought a lot the Mexico trip but also mad up a lot and I don‚Äôt mean with yking I mean genuinely talking to each other and not going to bed angry even when I was way to drunk to walk he took care of me so I forgave him. Although the next night we fought again because we were pulled over and the cop patted me down and went inside my dress then charged us money to let us go after we left I started crying because I was scared and he made fun of me and called me a cry baby I called my mom after and he said what am I gonna go cry to mommy but I didn‚Äôt tell her what happened I just called to check in on her and my niece and my sister she could tell I had been crying and asked if I was okay I sort of lied and said yes I‚Äôm just drunk and emotional for no reason and she said oh okay and I told her I loved her and to tell my mom and sister then hung up and cried more he hugged me not out of comfort but because he felt like he had to after our other friend A who‚Äôs a guy hugged me and comforted me. He continued being rude to me and we finally got back to the Airbnb but I ended up sobering up more than he was sober so I carried him up the stairs and laid him on the bed then slept on the couch. 

The next day he was still a butt hole and we argued again but I didn‚Äôt really argue I just walked away because I was emotionally tired. He called me too much and was saying I was overreacting but I felt I wasn‚Äôt. We ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù after he got mad at me for crawling under a truck to get a soccer ball for the kiddos because he said I was too childish and he couldn‚Äôt stand it so I said okay and I didn‚Äôt cry which shocked him because I started checking out of the relationship because I was getting drained. 

He tried holding my hand and hugging me and I pulled away he got mad asked what was wrong and I told him then he said he was hung over and didn‚Äôt mean it my naive delusional butt believed it. We finally got home the next day at 8 am I slept at his instead of driving to mine because I didn‚Äôt feel safe after not sleeping. 

Later on another day we got into another argument because he said I was stalking his family which I don‚Äôt know anything about his family and he got upset saying I was lying then I told him I don‚Äôt even know anything of their names because he‚Äôs never talked about them and finally reasoning got to him and he apologized. 

My breaking point came when he followed my cousin on facebook after I asked him not to and he promised the reason I asked him not to was because she‚Äôs known for dating the other cousins man and stealing them and causing drama he knew how I felt but did it anyway. I broke it off with him once he got back from his trip to another place because I couldn‚Äôt handle the lying and gaslighting anymore. 

We still text because I‚Äôm still in love with him. So last night while he asked me to move with him in September because he wants me to live with him when he moves back home and he wants to be with me he was very drunk and before that he talked about his ex and the sexual stuff they did after I asked him not to. Anyway AIO at the fact he‚Äôs lied so many times and the fact every time he‚Äôs drunk he brings her up and talks about her then talks about how he wants to be with me. AIO when we argue about the stuff in the past I always bring them up? Am I the toxic one for bringing them up and did I overreact about all of the stuff. Genuinely I‚Äôm confused he even says I‚Äôm the best and healthiest girl he‚Äôs been with but for some reason he still wants his ex so idk if I‚Äôm overthinking and overreacting over all of this. Please I need advice. I know I should probably end it but I don‚Äôt want to and would like advice on what to do. I‚Äôm in love and I can see he‚Äôs changed a little but not fully. Also anytime we argued I never yelled or hit him I always remained calm but he‚Äôd always say I was scaring him.

I know a lot of this kind of has nothing to due with the title but I really needed to spill it. I‚Äôll edit later today if he tells me the same things after he‚Äôs sobered up.",1,1754310498.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1mhc18i,https://i.redd.it/71aucgh8wzgf1.jpeg,I made a cereal milk flat white so that you don‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶,"I think I read this idea on here a while ago, and this is my second attempt at this, but the first that was actually tasty. My first go was with Honey Nut Cheerios and it was so overpoweringly sweet that I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. This time I used a chocolate cereal that was way less sweet and it was actually drinkable.


Used my cocktail strainer to strain the cereal milk into my frothing pitcher after finishing the bowl and made my typical drink. It definitely picked up the chocolate flavor and there are hints of the cereal, almost like an oat milk, but with using regular whole milk. I‚Äôm probably going to keep experimenting with different cereals, and if you want to try it, my advice is that unless you like very sweet drinks, go for the least-sugary cereal you can find with a flavor you want to drink with coffee.",25,1754310420.0,espresso,6,0.97,False
1mhc0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mhc0nk/uncover_the_truth_is_the_drinkmate_omnifizz_the/,Uncover the Truth: Is the DrinkMate OmniFizz the Best Soda Maker?,"When I first got my hands on the DrinkMate 410-02-14Zx4, I couldn‚Äôt wait to dive into the world of fizzy drinks. With its promise to carbonate just about anything, this soda maker intrigued me right from the start. Naturally, I had to put its capabilities to the test, and, after countless experiments, it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôve formed a love-hate relationship with it.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**

Aesthetically, this carbonation machine is quite the stunner. The sleek matte black finish gives it a modern and premium look, blending into my kitchen seamlessly. It has a compact footprint, so it didn‚Äôt take over my counter space, which is at a premium in my apartment. The manual operation is a double-edged sword‚Äîit saves you from worrying about cords and outlets but does demand a bit more effort. The stainless steel build feels durable, but I did notice that fingerprints tend to linger a bit, requiring regular cleaning to maintain its chic appearance.

**Innovative Technology Packed In**

What truly sets it apart is the patented Fizz Infuser technology. This feature slowly releases pressure from the bottle, making it safe and easy to carbonate beverages without any unexpected spurts or leaks. Unlike traditional soda makers that stick to water, this system embraces creativity. I‚Äôve carbonated everything from fresh orange juice to cold brew coffee, and even flat soda. The bubbles were consistent, and the flavor remained intact, which is a significant victory for any home carbonation enthusiast‚Äîseriously, carbonated iced tea is a game-changer. 

**Check DrinkMate 410-02-14Zx4 price on Amazon.**

**Performance for Everyday Usability**

Performance-wise, this machine gets a solid thumbs-up. The four 60L CO2 cylinders included can produce up to 240 liters of carbonated beverages. Considering I often host gatherings and love experimenting with different fizzy concoctions, these cylinders lasted longer than I initially expected. The carbonation levels were customizable‚Äîlight fizz for juices or an intense sparkle for mocktails‚Äîwhich added a layer of flexibility. However, it takes a bit of trial and error to find the perfect carbonation level for beverages beyond water.

**Winning Points**

- The compact and attractive design suits any kitchen d√©cor.  
- Patented Fizz Infuser handles pressure safely while carbonating diverse liquids.  
- Comes with four CO2 cylinders, offering significant value and longevity.  
- The carbonation levels are customizable for varied preferences.  

**Caveats**

- It requires frequent cleaning to avoid lingering odors, especially after carbonating drinks like wine or tea.  
- Fingerprint smudges are a constant battle on the stainless steel surface.  
- The manual operation demands some effort, which might not suit everyone.  

**Competing Brands**

Looking at similar options, the SodaStream lineup is an obvious comparison. SodaStream models offer electric-powered alternatives, which might appeal to those who prefer low-effort operation. While their machines are reliable and efficient, they mainly focus on carbonating water. This is where the DrinkMate shines. The flexibility to carbonate any beverage‚Äîincluding cocktails and juices‚Äîgives it a decisive edge. Additionally, SodaStream users often have to tackle proprietary CO2 cylinders, whereas the DrinkMate allows compatibility with standard options using adapters, proving itself to be the more versatile choice.

Another contender, the Aarke Carbonator, boasts a stylish stainless steel design. However, its higher price tag and limited use with only water make it less appealing for those who want to explore creative drinks. Between these three, DrinkMate has found a sweet spot by balancing affordability, versatility, and ease of use.

**Budget-Friendly Sparkles**

From a value perspective, this product delivers a lot for its price. The inclusion of reusable BPA-free bottles, the sturdy design, and, of course, four CO2 cylinders make it an enticing investment. Considering how much it saves on buying pre-made sparkling drinks, it‚Äôs easy to justify purchasing one, especially if you‚Äôre tired of the recurring expense of canned seltzers or want to reduce waste. Additionally, its ability to carbonate beyond plain water means no drink gets left behind. There‚Äôs clear long-term savings here if you‚Äôre someone who regularly enjoys effervescent beverages.

1mhbzho,https://i.redd.it/0zcgadcywzgf1.jpeg,Margo and Marce is a Retro Typeface That Feels Like a Conversation,"In a digital world built on sharp vectors and flawless grids, a quiet revolution is taking place. Designers and brands are consciously turning towards aesthetics that feel more human, more personal, and more authentic. This movement finds its perfect expression in the [Margo and Marcel](https://weandthecolor.com/margo-and-marcel-font-komet-flicker/205001) font, a hand-drawn retro typeface from Komet & Flicker. This isn't just another font; it's a deliberate choice to infuse warmth and personality into design. With its charming, all-caps style and a friendly, down-to-earth vibe, **Margo and Marcel** provides a powerful tool for anyone looking to create a genuine connection with their audience.

# The Anatomy of a Friendly Typeface

What gives **Margo and Marcel** its distinctive and approachable character? The magic lies in its thoughtful construction, which prioritizes personality over sterile perfection. It‚Äôs a study in how intentional imperfections can create a more engaging visual experience.

At its core, **Margo and Marcel** is defined by its hand-drawn origins. Each letter was individually crafted, resulting in the subtle inconsistencies and organic shapes that machines cannot replicate. This quality makes the font feel relatable and sincere. Think of it as the typographic equivalent of a friendly, handwritten note left on a colleague's desk. Consequently, it bypasses the formal, corporate feel of many standard fonts and instead communicates with a disarming warmth. This inherent personality makes the typeface feel truly unique.

Komet & Flicker elevated **Margo and Marcel** beyond a simple A-Z character set. Its creative flexibility is significantly enhanced by a few key additions. The font includes alternate versions for eight different characters (C, G, I, J, K, Q, R, and S). This allows a designer to manually swap out letters to avoid conspicuous repetition, giving text a more custom, hand-lettered appearance.

Furthermore, the inclusion of 20 pre-designed connecting words like ""AND,"" ""THE,"" and ""WITH"" is a game-changer. These glyphs are crafted to link words together fluidly, strengthening the illusion of bespoke lettering and adding a layer of professional polish to the casual aesthetic.

# Why Margo and Marcel is a Strategic Design Choice

Imagine it on the packaging for artisanal coffee, the logo for a boutique clothing store, or the website for a creative professional. The font immediately signals craftsmanship, care, and a human-first philosophy that deeply resonates with today's consumers.

On crowded digital platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, or even in email newsletters, capturing attention requires more than a good photo. The typography needs to be compelling. The charming and legible nature of **Margo and Marcel** makes it ideal for creating shareable graphics, video thumbnails, and engaging headlines. Its warmth feels less like advertising and more like a friendly recommendation, which can dramatically improve user engagement and shareability.

# How to Master the Margo and Marcel Font

Unlocking the full potential of this typeface means knowing how to use its special features. The process is straightforward in modern design software.

To use the alternate characters and connecting words, you need to open the Glyphs panel in your design program of choice.
