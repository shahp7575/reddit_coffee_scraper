1hnfk5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hnfk5e/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1735308110.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False
1hnfh68,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnfh68/have_yourself_a_black_sabbath_christmas/,Have Yourself a BLACK SABBATH Christmas,"Hi. My name is Randall Huckabee, I’m a retired librarian. Mr. Excitement, that’s me. As a hobby, I’ve taken to assembling music box figurines. It’s easy, you can order them from Amazon. Since they come mostly assembled, I decided to spruce things up by replacing the music. Not an easy feat, let me tell you. They come equipped with tiny keyboards that only play certain notes. Good thing I learned to play piano.

I like jazz music. Not the over-the-top, can’t-tap-your-toes-to-it jazz, but Cool Jazz. Think: Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck – and if I’m feeling extra spicy – Thelonius Monk. 

My goal was to personalize some figurines and give them to my family. Sounds nice, right? It was a good idea. It truly was. But something went dreadfully wrong.

I made six in total. One for each of my three sisters (all younger), two for my kids (all grown up now), and one for my wife. She’s deceased, but don’t get choked up about that. Life, as they say, must go on. Still, I like to think she’s here with me in this rickety old house. Same house we raised our children many moons ago. 

For the kids (and their spouses), I chose Jack and what’s-her-name from the movie Titanic. You know, the scene where they’re at the bow of the ship, arms locked, gazing at the wondrous world of the ocean. And for music, I added ‘I Will Survive’. Looking back, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea, considering the Titanic sank. But hindsight is what it is, and the irony was lost on me.

For my sisters: tiny ballerinas. As children, they’d parade in their pink tutus, dancing along to the Nutcracker. So, for the music, I chose Carol of the Bells. Finding a music box with that many notes was strenuous. Plus, it’s a difficult tune to play, especially for an arthritic old fart like me. But I persevered. That’s what I do. 

For my darling wife, I wanted something special, seeing how this year would’ve been our wedding 50th anniversary, so I made her an angel who plays Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World. You see, this may be my last Christmas in this rickety old house. Doctors say my time left on earth is limited. But isn’t that true for all of us? Anyway, I’m sidetracking. “Get to the point, Randy!” my wife would say. “You’re procrastinating again!”

Last week, my family showed up for Christmas dinner. We chose to have it earlier in the month, to fit everyone’s hectic schedule. The dinner was nice. My sister Maybelle (the oldest of the bunch) cooked a turkey as plump as ol’ Saint Nick, with all the fixings. My youngest son Luke and his wife brought oven-baked apple pie. Mmm mmm, good.

Then there’s Eitan, my one-and-only grandchild. A real hell-raiser, he is. Damn kid nearly burned the house down, mucking about with the candles during dinner. Although looking back, maybe that would’ve done us all a favor. 

After the Christmas feast, we exchanged gifts. The sisters got me sweaters. Not the cheap ones either. The thick, woolly ones that can endure any winter hardship. The kids chipped in and bought me a TV as big as a movie screen. They even signed me up to all the latest streaming sites. If only I could get the stupid remotes to cooperate, maybe I’d catch a show or two. But I digress.

The trouble started in the wee hours of night. By then, most of the family was gone. The sisters left shortly after the gifts were exchanged (surprise, surprise), and Paul, my oldest, left later that evening; Luke, his wife Charla, and Eitan stayed the night. Eitan, the little brat, kept mucking about with my wife’s figurine, getting his filthy hands all over it. I damn-near skinned his hide, too. Would have, if that were allowed these days. 

The boy slept on the couch, Paul and Charla slept in the spare bedroom. Paul’s old room, in fact. Ralf, my dear ol’ Great Dane, slept with me on the bed, as he always does. Sometime during the night, a creature was stirring, but it wasn’t a mouse. Nor was it quiet. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I shot out of bed like a firecracker. Where’s the banging coming from? And why so friggin’ loud? Figuring it was the neighbors having a party, I buried my head under the pillows.

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

I nearly fell off the bed, it was THAT loud. Greatly distorted, too, like heavy metal music played full volume. I didn’t like it. Neither did Ralf. He started barking, which he rarely does. By now, the entire household was awake, wondering where the hellish racket was coming from. 

We assembled in the living room, rubbing the sleep from our eyes. Paul was hungover, I could tell. Too much eggnog. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The nightmarish noise was ear-splitting. The bass pounded our eardrums into submission. I thought it was the TV, so I started screwing with it, but I inadvertently turned it full bast, adding to the mayhem. Paul was shouting at me, but I couldn’t hear him. I’m partially deaf. Meaning: if the noise was this loud to me, I can only imagine how loud it must’ve been for them.

Eitan, wearing Spider Man pajamas two sizes too small, was bawling, snot sliding down his fatty face. The kid looked like maple syrup was poured over him, and he was trying to lick it off. His mother was freaking. She stole the remote, turned off the TV, then threw the remote against the wall. Good thing it didn’t break.  

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The weight of the noise nearly knocked me over. I’d never heard anything so loud. So offensive. So rude.  

I AM IRON MAN.

The voice was sardonic and overtly cynical. A demon’s voice. And still, nobody knew where it was coming from. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The bass drum was rattling inside my brain. I was shaking all over. Simultaneously sweaty and cold. Hell, I thought I was suffering a stroke. A heart attack, perhaps. Then I recognized what I was hearing. It was that damned devil-worshiping group from England: Black Sabbath. 

I hate Black Sabbath. Amateur musicians, at best. But my wife loved them. Saw them in concert too. Many times. (We’d had several heated quarrels about this, but ultimately, I lost every one of them.)

What the heck was happening here? Why was Black Sabbath performing in my house? And must they play so loudly? Paul, slack-jawed, steam puffing from his cauliflower ears, was scanning every inch of the living room. He even checked outside. Just in case. No one knew where the God-awful noise was coming from. Ralf went sniffing, searching for clues. When he approached my wife’s music box, he started barking at it.

“The music box!” shouted Paul, loud enough for the neighbors to hear. 

“What?” 

“The music box!”

“Speak up!”

This was getting ridiculous. Eitan pissed himself, like the big baby he was, urine dripping down his plump little leg. Charla was livid, shouting orders at the top of her lungs, but the boy couldn’t hear her over the blasted heavy metal music.

I started crying. I hate to admit this, but I was overstimulated. And tired. It was 3 am, for Christ’s sake. I should be sleeping. Hell, we all should be. Nothing good ever happens at 3 am. 

Eitan grabbed the harp-tooting angel and stuck it inside his mouth. The sound lowered ever so slightly, proving the racket was indeed coming from inside the music box. Impossible as it may be.

The kid’s mother was furious. “Gimme that, Eaty. Or else!”

The boy refused to give it up; instead, he leapt off the couch like a guitar villain and started rocking out, snot charging down his chin. All the while, the little angel kept blaring that devil’s music. 

HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

“Drop dthe box, Eaty!” Charla kept shouting. 

The boy farted, and some of it leaked out. (A shart, I’d later learn.) I could’ve killed him right then and there. Amidst the chaos, Eitan threw the figurine against the bookshelf. It knocked over some books, and teetered vicariously over the edge. 

IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD?

Everyone held their breath. The bookshelf was about to crash.

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

The teetering blue angel tumbled. 

NOW HE HAS HIS REVENGE

Down came the entire bookshelf, the angel toppled by a Holy Bible. Everyone gasped. Ralf, the cowardly ol’ pooch, disappeared into my bedroom, whimpering. We stood transfixed, reveling in the resounding silence. A platoon of hardcovers, mostly Harry Bosch, carpeted the living room floor. The lamp was broken, the light bulb shattered. None of that mattered. What mattered most was the bulky, black Bible. It belonged to my wife’s grandfather, who brought it over from Sicily, way back when. I was warned never to harm it.   

The leatherbound bible boasted a creepy golden cross. Surrounding it, heavenly words I didn’t understand. Something about Christ being the King. The bible was from the Gothic era, so it looked creepy. It weighed as much as Eitan, I’d wager.

All eyes were on me. Nobody knew what to do. Hell, I didn’t know what to do either. Truth be told, I was terrified. If I thought too deeply about this, I’d go bat-shit bonkers. So, instead of standing around like an idiot, I joined ol’ quivering Ralf on my bed, leaving Paul and his wife and their sulky boy to deal with it. 

Next came nightmares. While sleeping, I was assaulted by never-ending heavy metal music. Namely, Black Sabbath. Every damned song in their catalogue, as far as I could tell. Although they all sound the same. I couldn’t wake up soon enough.

They must’ve cleaned up the mess, because when I awoke, the books were in their rightful spot on the shelf, a bright new bulb lit the lamp. The Holy Bible was returned to its rightful spot on the bookshelf. Everything was hunky-dory. Except for one thing.

“Where’s the music box?”

Charla, looking twelve years older than she did the previous day, shot Paul a look. Paul gulped. They were sitting at the kitchen table, fully-dressed, sipping freshly-brewed coffee, wearing worried-sick faces. While waiting for a response, I poured myself a mug, praying last night was an elaborate hoax. Maybe they’d drugged me. Wouldn’t put it past them. 

“Um, Pop,” Paul stuttered. “The music boxes were a nice gesture…” Charla’s eyes never leaving his, “but...” Tomato-faced, he returned the gift.

I was stunned. “If you don’t want the damned thing, just say so!”  

Paul nodded. Charla squeezed his arm, then adjusted her glasses, which were too large for her thinly freckled face. 

“But…” pouted Eithen. “I want it!” 

I noticed he was wearing an Iron Man tee, which was covered in chocolate. Or at least, I hoped it was chocolate. Glued to his filthy little fingers was my wife’s music box. He pressed play. Then he farted. Overwhelmed by the abominable odour, the twirling blue angel sang. Oh, what a wonderful world indeed.  

Charla’s face matched Paul’s. What a bunch of nincompoops. After the most awkward breakfast in the history of the world, they decided to keep their gift, which was still in its box. Eitan wanted to reassemble it. The kid may be a jackass, but at least he was curious. 

After they left, I spent the day trying to figure out the new TV. Yeah, call me a stereotype-old-gaffer (which I am), but I couldn’t get the stupid thing to cooperate. Finally, after hours of mucking about, and several YouTube tutorials later, I got the stupid thing to work. I was set to retire for the night, when the phone buzzed. My sisters were calling. It was a group chat, which they’d never done. I didn’t like it. Figured someone must’ve died. 

“Hello?”

After an uncomfortable silence, Maybelle spoke up. 

“Um, Randy,” she coughed. “How are things?”

“Get to the point, May. I’m in bed.”

More coughing. I could hear a woman’s voice in the background. The voice didn’t sound pleasant. 

“That music box…” 

More muffled chatter. 

Melanie, the oldest, interrupted. “It’s possessed!”

Silence. 

“There,” her voice lowered, “I said it.”

I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, and once I started, I couldn’t stop. Even Ralph joined up, barking up a storm.

“Randy,” now Maybelle, “We’re serious.” 

“Unless,” back to Mel, “you triggered them to play Black FUCKING Sabbath, full volume.”

“Even when they’re shut off…”

“In the middle of the night!”

A chill dripped down my spine. I dropped the phone. What in blue-blazes were they gabbing about? Possessed? Black Sabbath? Then I remembered. It’s funny how the mind works. It tricks you. By dinner time, I’d forgotten about the mayhem from the previous night.  

“Hello?” Maybelle speaking, “Anybody home?”

“You two are off your rockers!”

I hung up. They could destroy the damned things for all I cared. I put my heart and soul into assembling those music boxes. Now this? I put my phone on silent and went to bed. Good riddance. 

…

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I snapped awake. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

“What the?”

Ralf was trembling, his puppy-dog eyes all droopy. He stood up, shaking, then half-hid under the bed.   

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The Noise. Loud as a 747, rude and mean and raucous. This can’t be happening. I’m dreaming. Must be. 

I AM IRON MAN.

My blood turned icy cold, the hairs standing tall on my arms. My testicles disappeared. As the electric guitar soared, seventy-seven years of pent-up rage came coursing through my veins. I leapt out of bed, tripped over Ralf, and fell face-first. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The music was FULL VOLUME. Everywhere at once. I hated it. I stood up (slowly this time), and pinched myself. This is real, I reminded myself. As crazy as it may be.  

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

I checked the time: 3:33 am. Somehow, this made it worse. Like a war-weathered tank, I barged into the living room, fists clenched, ready for battle. 

“Where’s the wretched box?”

My voice was drowned out by the noise. Something caught my attention. My wife, in the prime of her youth, regarding me via her framed high school picture. In it, she’s wearing a Black Sabbath tee, smiling mischievously. Taunting me. 

I turned and stubbed my toe. Damn, it hurt. Cursing my existence, I stole another glance at my wife. She’s probably having herself a good chuckle. Heck, she probably knows all the words. I was livid. I’m surprised the police aren’t banging on the door, the noise was THAT loud.

NOBODY WANTS HIM. 

Where's the damned music box? Frantic, I scanned the living room. AHA! The bottom shelf. How in blue blazes did it get down there? And who repaired it? I knelt down and inspected it. The cracks it suffered were gone; it looked brand new. Still, something about the angel seemed wrong. Mostly, her eyes. They were callous and cold, impossibly red. The rest of her seemed fine. Heavenly pink heart-shaped wings cradling her Tiffany-blue body, tin whistle tucked between her ashen lips. But those eyes... 

PLANNING HIS VENGEANCE.

My heart, rickety as a wooden roller coaster, nearly exploded. I raced to the garage, sweating and shivering at the same time; and after a panicky search, I found my hammer. 

VENGEANCE FROM HIS GRAVE.

The blue angel tooted its whistle, fiery red eyes never leaving mine. 

KILL THE PEOPLE HE ONCE SAVED.

I swung the hammer. 

The angel exploded. 

And the music stopped. 

So did my heart. 

…

As the week passed, my health steadily improved. But not a day went by when I didn’t think about the damned music box; the cursed blue angel, who died not once, but twice. I thought about that dreadful band from Britain. And, of course, I thought about my wife.  

…

This morning, a package arrived. I wasn’t expecting anything. But then again, tis the season, right? The box was decently heavy and marked FRAGILE. When I opened the package, I gasped. 

The ballerinas. 

Not one, but all three. My good-for-nothing sisters sent them back to me! Not surprisingly, I suppose, since I’d been ignoring their texts and emails. Not just from them, but from Luke and his wife. Like I needed more stress. 

Disgruntled, I found a place for the ballerinas on the bookshelf. I wound up the little ballerinas, just in case, checking to see if they were jinxed. Carol of the Bells percolated from the tiny dancers as they twirled. Phew! Relief came instantaneously. 

After dinner, I retreated to the living room for some quality TV time before bed. I must’ve fallen asleep on the sofa, because around 3 am, I snapped awake. My heart sped up. Then it stopped. Then it started up again, twice as fast. I groaned. This can’t be happening. Please God. Not again.

For context our boys are 15 months. I am a sahm and my husband works full time Monday-Friday. I have the boys on a pretty rigid schedule but I take them out on walks daily and they do well going through our downtown area to the coffee shop & restaurants when I am with my mom during the week. They just recently started walking so we have been taking them more to parks so they can explore which doesn’t usually last long cause they get tired and then we head home. I’ve done that with my mom and husband. 

However, every holiday or birthday event we’ve been to, it always end in an argument with my husband. I start the day stressed about their schedule getting messed up plus having to get them and me ready. It’s a lot to pack: diaper bag, extra clothes, portable high chairs, water bottles, bibs, stroller, baby gate, toys, snacks, blankets etc. My husband gets the big items ready. The boys cry every time we put them in the car seats. Not sure if that’s cause I don’t take them in the car much (I don’t have my own, just husbands truck) but once we put Bob Marley on they quiet down and they usually always fall asleep. Then we reach our destination and they are good for the most part until they get cranky and tired since they aren’t in their usual environment. It’s just not enjoyable having  to control 2 toddlers in non baby proofed houses. I of course don’t expect special baby proofing but it’s exhausting. They don’t like others to hold them for long. So it’s usually us holding them or we keep them in an area with the baby gate. Outside is usually never an option since every house we go to has a pool in the backyard. The last house we went to had a fire going on in the fireplace so living room wasn’t an option and they kept trying to get to the dogs bowl in kitchen plus they had their fully decorated Christmas trees so the whole time I just have hawk eyes on them. So by the end of the event my husband and I are tired and annoyed with each other since the whole day from the beginning was not relaxing or enjoyable. He argues that we need to take them out more to get them used to the car seats and other family members and I agree but when I do suggest taking them somewhere on the weekend like to the store he says I’ll just go after bedtime. I am trying to be more go with the flow about their schedule but somehow I always feel like it’s my fault that the day wasn’t enjoyable. I understand we need to get them used to more environments but just packing everything up is draining plus the non baby proofed places. I just want to know when will we have fun as a family for more than 30-60 mins since that’s the amount of time we go on walks to the park and seems to be the only enjoyable outing we have together with them.

Nick relayed the story so far to Queenie. He talked about boosting the memory cube, finding out it was empty, meeting with Jameson, working with Sunny, the whole story. When he's finished, she was silent a long time.

""Nick, I can see why your ladies like you. You have empathy, and are kind and are generous. Honestly when we first met I was just a twinge sad that Evie wasn't interested."" She chuckled. ""But Nick, you're… kind of dim, you get that, right?""

Eastern nodded. ""Finally, someone else sees it. Right Sel?""

Selkirk agreed and her tail flicked, playfully. ""Dim as a spent LED.""

""I *knew* there was a reason I liked your girlfriends Nick. They're the smart ones. So, let's get down to it. You, and I assume Eastern have a full suite of cybernetics installed by Jameson's dark doctors, and he didn't even give you a tutorial?” Nick could hear her tisk over speakers. “That sounds like Jameson. I swear, the AIs are all the same. It's *easy* for them, so they assume it's easy for everyone. Selkirk, Eastern, this is going to take a bit, and I think you'll be bored. Why don't you head up front with Evie and see if you three can figure out dinner. Me and Nick’ll be ready to take a break by then.""

Eastern and Selkirk stood, Eastern glancing at Nick, not saying anything. They locked eyes, and he shrugged with his eyes. ""Sure thing Queenie, thanks for taking care of our pet idiot.” Selkirk said, laughing. “We'll figure out how to pay you.""

Queenie chuckled. ""Don't worry, it'll be very affordable."" She paused a moment. “Probably.”

They made their way to the front and found Evie back behind the counter, watching something on her Pad. ""Queenie kicked you out eh?"" She didn’t look up from her show.

""Yeah, said we should find dinner. She and Nick are going to be hungry when they're done.""

Evie nodded. ""Probably. Even now, when Queenie gets it in her head to do some work, everyone else comes out tired.""

Selkirk looked up at Evie. If she squinted, she could see the resemblance. They had a similar bone structure in their cheeks, the same color eyes. ""Evie, I thought most humans died around one hundred or less. She's so..."" she struggled to find the words and still be polite. ""Coherent?""

Evie laughed. ""She has good days and bad days. You're just lucky today was a good day. But yeah, she thinks the implants are keeping her alive almost as much as her body at this point.""

""Where did she get them?"" Eastern asks, as she comes up to the counter where Sel and Evie were talking.

""Just like she explained. An AI thought they were 'helping' and gave them to her. As you probably guessed by our experience with Nick, running the shop wasn't always out main source of income and Queenie's line of work isn’t exactly... legal all the time.""

They said nothing, letting her continue to speak.

""To hear her say it, it was… *fashionable* to have black market cybernetic mods installed back 70, 80 years ago. I don't know, it seems an awfully foolish thing to do for fashion, but she swears it was 'this close' to going mainstream.” Evie glances at Sel. “Not like, limbs and eyes and augs,” Evie says quickly, noticing the K’laxi’s artificial eye. “I mean, the real deep brain stuff, the things that let you interface with AI hardware.”

Selkirk glanced back down the hall. ""I don't know. I've been around humans a long time, and I completely believe that they'd do something stupid like get cybernetic implants for fashion.""

Evie laughed. ""You're right of course. How long have you been on Hyacinth, Selkirk?"" Eastern leaned against the counter and just listened. She hadn’t heard much of this out of Selkirk either.

""You can call me Sel if you want. I've been here, Ancestors, twenty five years now? I moved here from K'lax when I was just a kid. Familial group got together and sent me off to a magnet school on Hyacinth."" She smiled bitterly. ""Go and make something of yourself. Do your family proud!"" She shook her head. ""I was mostly sent here to get out of the way. The paterfamilias wanted *his* offspring to take over the leadership of the familial group. An older kit from a deceased line was a... complication.""

Evie looked down at Selkirk, her eyes kind. ""Do you still talk to them?""

Selkirk flicked her ears. ""Not in years. I sent them a message back when the Empress Melody shit started going down telling them I was all right and going to stay on Hyacinth, but they never even bothered to reply, so... I stopped sending messages. I'm sure they think they're better off that way.""

""Oh Selkirk. I bet there are still people in your familial group that love you."" Eastern chimed in.

Sel snorted - another human gesture. ""You haven't met them. I'm sure they don't feel any ill will towards me, but I'm also sure they don't feel anything to me. It's ancient history."" She leaned back off the counter. ""Queenie said to get dinner, so I assume that if we don't she'll be upset.""

Evie laughed. ""Upset is possibly the most mild way that could be phrased."" She took out her pad. ""I know some local places that she likes, take a look and tell me which ones would work for you and your crew.""

Nick came out of Queenie’s room hours later looking exhausted but pleased. She came out shortly after them with the help of her walker, but she also looked brighter and more alive than when she went in. Instead of going to Queenie's bedroom, they made their way to the front of the store, where Selkirk and Eastern had set up a table piled high with takeout from a local place. 

Nick looked hungrily at the food. ""This is quite a spread Selkirk, nice work!""

Selkirk flicked her tail and her ears and smiled. ""Evie helped, but we all decided that you were going to come out of your training hungry.""

""I feel like I haven't eaten in years."" Nick laughs and sat at the table."" 

Queenie shuffled to the head of the table and sat. ""Now, like I told you, those implants are powered by your bodies. Use them a lot and you need the calories to recover."" She poked Nick's soft belly. ""It's also a decent way to build a calorie deficit if you ever decide to lose that paunch, Nicholas North,"" but she was smiling as she said it.

They all sat down and started on dinner. After a few minutes, Selkirk looked up at Nick. ""How did it go?""

Queenie started gesturing with a fork full of food. ""Typical AI. Stuff a human full of tech and send them on their way without so much as a lesson on how to work it. He was frankly lucky he knew me; he could have had his brain braised by the first aggressive attack he endured."" 

Eastern put down her fork. ""We're very grateful Queenie, thanks for all the help."" 

Nick nodded and swallowed, “Yeah, thanks again.” He looked at Sel and Eastern. “Queenie helped me through an initial setup, helped me with my encryption and firewalls and gave me some basic lessons on access and intrusion. She says I even have enough deep brain connections to pilot a starship in a pinch.”

Selkirk and Eastern stopped, mid bite. Sel blinked and looked at Nick, surprised. ""You can pilot a starship?""

Nick shrugged awkwardly and blushed very slightly. ""According to Queenie, I have additional modules and sensors that… could be related to piloting starships. She thinks its an upgrade to the old Colony Ship co-captain package. Back before wormhole linking, the relativistic colony ships would travel with an AI and Human sharing captain duties, and the human would need additional… hardware to be able to do it.”

""But... why? You're not going to be piloting a starship."" Eastern said, carefully.

Nick shrugged. ""Who knows with AIs. Maybe Jameson thinks I'll need it. Maybe he thought it would be funny. Maybe he's making a point to another AI faction that we don't even know about."" He put his head down and continued to eat.

Eastern sighed and nodded resigned. “We're pawns in a much larger thing here. It's entirely possible that Jameson gave Nick the piloting package to show *someone* that AIs aren't the only game in town when it comes to operating a ship.”

Queenie looked up at the three of them. ""*My* advice is to not try and make sense of what AIs do. They go and do their own thing; they always have. It's up to us to stay out of their way and try and not get burned. Remember what they did when Empress Melody came by? They linked in a pile of their own Starjumpers and attacked her right above us. I remember looking up and seeing the flashes of the fight. Even here on Hyacinth it was visible. It was something else."" She shook her head sadly. ""I never got to meet the Empress, but I heard she was looking out for everyone in Sol."" She looked up at the three of them sharply. “Heed that lesson. Keep your heads down, do your work, and don't get involved in AI politics.""

Nick glanced at Eastern, but she didn't say anything.

After Dinner, Selkirk tried to pay Queenie and Evie but they wouldn't take her money. ""You bought dinner, *and* you owe us a favor, that's enough."" Queenie’s small voice was like iron when she refused the money. Evie smiled, playing the ‘good CSE’ to Queenie’s ‘bad CSE’. Evie continued, “Now, don't be a stranger down here, come by and say hello to us every now and then. I haven't seen her this active in weeks."" She winked at the three of them. ""You're a good influence on her.""

Queenie's cackling laugh startled them as she shuffled towards the back door. ""They're anything but Evie, but they're fun to be around. If you ever need a fence, even for high value stuff you see old Queenie first, you get me?"" She turned and locked eyes with Nick. “I’ll get you a fair price. I always have.”

Eastern assured them that they'd be the first place they stopped when they had some goods to fence and said their goodbyes. When they left the shop it was late. The Metro ran all night long, but was on a reduced schedule to allow for maintenance. They decided to take an omnibus up to Eastern's apartment. As they rumbled along one of the main arteries up Hyacinth, the rocking motion and gentle movement caused Eastern and Selkirk to quickly fall asleep on Nick as he looked out the window and watched the lights and nightlife of Hyacinth go by. It was a weeknight, but still there were people out living life and having fun, pouring out from bars and laughing in a pile as they clicked for a Hopper. He mused on what Queenie had said about AI politics. It was entirely too little too late, but he did appreciate that Queenie cared enough to give the warning. They were being played off two if not three different factions now with no real sign as to why. Nick woke everyone up when it was their stop. They made their way home and fell into bed.

The next morning, everyone got up, got dressed, got some coffee, and tried to come up with something to do. They still hadn't heard from Sunny, so it was just a matter of waiting to hear from her. She had said that she would do fifty hours of searching, and by Nick's reckoning that meant they'd hear from her tomorrow afternoon.

Nick declared that they'd head to the lake today. Since Hyacinth is so large, the original designers decided to put a large lake on each arm. It was a long shallow lake, not more than three or four meters deep, but that was enough for watercraft and swimming and a small marine ecosystem. The beaches on the lake were a popular destination. Against Eastern's protestations, Nick took the girls shopping. They rode down arm to some mid range shopping in Laurel square and soon enough Nick found what he was looking for. He bought Eastern a black bikini and a sari skirt in blue and yellow, and found a K'laxi style bathing suit he thought would suit Sel. When Eastern saw what he bought her she blushed. ""Nicholas North, you horndog.""

Selkirk looked up at the both of them, as she felt the fabric of what Nick picked for her. It was exactly her style, and she loved how it felt. ""What?""

Eastern laughed. ""This is what I was wearing when Nick and I were connected together during the surgery. Nick took me to a memory of a beach on Parvati.""

Selkirk's ears flicked as she smiled lasciviously. “He has impeccable taste, you look great in it.""

Eastern stared at Selkirk's suit too. “He does have great taste, doesn’t he? The suit he picked for you is stunning.""

Selkirks tail and ears poofed in embarrassment. ""It not a style I would have ever picked for myself, but I admit I look good in it."" Selkirk and Eastern went to Nick and both gave him a kiss. ""Nice work.""

This time, they picked out a suit for Nick. Eastern insisted on a black speedo like in their shared dream and after picking up some towels they headed back out, their bathing suits on under their street clothes. The most popular beach was off Dahila square. When they arrived, they grabbed some food to eat later and took the short omnibus ride to the beach.

Growing up in Naya Chennai, right on the water, the beach on Hyacinth was a bit of a letdown for Nick, though he did his best to hide it from the girls. He went to the beach once or twice after he first moved here and while it was interesting to have a lake and a beach in space, it really couldn't compare to the ocean. Eastern, a kid who was born and raised in space loved it though. It was the largest body of water she had ever seen - while awake. Selkirk had fun too. She hadn't been to a large body of water since she was a child, and while she was a terrible swimmer - most K’laxi were - she did enjoy splashing around in the shallows. Nick decided to try and leg go of his opinions about it being a 'real' beach and just have fun.

They spent the afternoon at the beach, sitting on the soft sand, splashing in the water and having a fun time. Nick even convinced them to rent a watercraft and they zipped around the lake, getting a view of everything. It was the first time Nick drove a watercraft since leaving Parvati and was pleased to find he still had a knack for it. He found a small secluded beach far away from everyone else and they stopped and relaxed all on their own. 

After only a few minutes of lying on the sand, Eastern sat up and declared that she wanted to try having sex on the beach like in the romance novels she read.

It was *very* sandy.

After, everyone went into the water to wash the sand off and Nick grimaced. ""I think I speak for everyone when I say that I got sand in places I didn't think it was possible to get sand into. Let's keep that one to the novels, okay?""

Selkirk was in the water up to her head scrubbing her fur as hard as she could. ""I agree.""

By now it was evening and they had to return the rental. They made their way back to the main beach, returned the rental, and found a restaurant right on the water to get dinner. Hyacinth doesn't have sunsets, not really, but it was gently getting dark as they ate, and they even heard some animals in the water making noise as it got darker. You had to squint a little, but you could pretend you were on a planet. Nick looked over at his girlfriends and smiled. ""Thanks.""

""Eastern raised her eyebrow. ""For what, Nick?""

""For being here. For being with me. Both of you. This is nice. Sure, we are deep into some shit, but we're into it together. I don't know."" He looked out at the water. ""It just feels a little more solvable with you two here with me, eating a nice dinner, looking out at the water.""

Selkirk flicked her ears and smiled. ""It is nice. Thanks to you too Nick. I'm glad we're all here, together.""

After dinner, they slowly made their way back to Eastern's place, chatting and laughing. They made it to Eastern's place and fell into bed, tired and happy.",4,1735307608.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

My project is currently at 2,600+ users and 80+ active paying customers after about two and a half months since launching, so today I’ll tell you how I got my first users and hopefully it can be of help to you on your journey.

So this is exactly how we did it.

**I'll try to be as concise as possible because I know reading a wall of text is boring.**

I'll start from the beginning:

How did we come up with our idea?

We experienced a problem ourselves that we wanted to solve.

After a few days of market research, head-scratching, and coffee drinking, an idea for a solution began to take shape.

To see if others experienced the problem and if there was interest in our solution, we created a survey and shared it on our target audience's subreddit.

The survey questions were:

1. *Do you build businesses?*

To get responses we made sure to offer them feedback on their project in return.

**You have to give something to get something.**

This can take a few tries so if you don't get many responses > improve post and try again.

We got positive feedback on the idea so we built the MVP.

About 30 days later it was finished.

To get our first users for it we:

* Shared the MVP to the survey participants
* Did a launch post on their subreddit

The results..

* First 3 users now!

Not bad.

We need more.

So we..

Kept posting in communities of our target audience for two weeks

* Daily posts in the Build in Public community on X
* Every other day in r/indiehackers, SaaS, and SideProject on Reddit

These were posts talking about subjects related to our project and would often end with mentioning our product.

Our total users after two weeks..

**+100 new users**

That’s amazing! We had never had that many users even after months of working on our previous two projects.

This approach:

* Didn't take too much time.
* Didn't take too much effort.
* Didn't cost any money.

You can do it too if you apply yourself.

At this point you've got an MVP and you have your first users. Now all you do is get as much feedback as possible and improve your product.

All the time we've spent improving our product based on user feedback has definitely made marketing easier for us, so I highly recommend it!

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany and Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn’t so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). I came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. Then south-east through Austria on the Silvretta and through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d’Ampezzo towards Venice. I’d never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I’d thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. An interesting experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I had been made to believe. 

From there on I turned east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg) where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It’s French, but don’t say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB’s and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It’s quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can’t really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There’s more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn’t bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo we pushed the KTM out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‘lost potential’. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn’t happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It’s a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it’s definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it’s basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn’t mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who’s using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it’s there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There’s hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There’s occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro’s worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don’t give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren’t nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren’t openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they’d have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don’t know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn’t, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they’d just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn’t expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It’s going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I’ve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there’s even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you’re offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you – but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren’t a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I’d like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: “Here, take my number. If you’re ever in front of someone who doesn’t speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you”. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It’s a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF. Also, [the Kuwaiti customs officials that helped me so nicely](https://i.imgur.com/9pqvmE5.jpg).



**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn’t very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn’t particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn’t take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‘Hulanda’ in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80’ies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don’t last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there’s pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it’s impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It’s essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there’s no space or time for extended controls or they’ll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there’s the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It’s only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there’s a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn’t make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You’ve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren’t entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It’s hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it’s much better than what they’d get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it’s also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I’d have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it’s possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there’s always a bit of traffic around and it’s easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‘civilized’](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could’ve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it’s a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it’s obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro’s for Riyals, about 50 euro’s worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn’t having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro’s for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‘the rose-colored city half as old as time itself’. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‘lost’ for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there’s not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), and the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards.",2,1735307327.0,motorcycle,1,1.0,False

## **TLDR; Bike is nice. Desert is hot. Governments suck.**

[Approximate route](https://i.imgur.com/8tVuJeI.png) (red there, blue back)

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany and Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn’t so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). I came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. Then south-east through Austria on the Silvretta and through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d’Ampezzo towards Venice. I’d never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I’d thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. An interesting experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I had been made to believe. 

From there on I turned east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg) where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It’s French, but don’t say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB’s and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It’s quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can’t really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There’s more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn’t bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo we pushed the KTM out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‘lost potential’. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn’t happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It’s a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it’s definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it’s basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn’t mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who’s using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it’s there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There’s hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There’s occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro’s worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don’t give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren’t nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren’t openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they’d have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don’t know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn’t, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they’d just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn’t expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It’s going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I’ve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there’s even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you’re offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you – but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren’t a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I’d like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: “Here, take my number. If you’re ever in front of someone who doesn’t speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you”. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It’s a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF.

**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn’t very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn’t particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn’t take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‘Hulanda’ in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80’ies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don’t last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there’s pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it’s impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It’s essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there’s no space or time for extended controls or they’ll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there’s the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It’s only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there’s a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn’t make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You’ve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren’t entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It’s hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it’s much better than what they’d get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it’s also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I’d have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it’s possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there’s always a bit of traffic around and it’s easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‘civilized’](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could’ve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it’s a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it’s obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro’s for Riyals, about 50 euro’s worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn’t having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro’s for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‘the rose-colored city half as old as time itself’. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‘lost’ for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there’s not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), and the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards.",2,1735307323.0,motorcycles,3,1.0,False

* ""Tides is a nonprofit and philanthropic organization dedicated to advancing social justice.""
* ""Everything we do starts with justice. Without it, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives appear equitable without actually working to dismantle the harmful power dynamics inherent in traditional philanthropy.""
* Previously backed by George Soros
* Backed Media Matters (left-wing media watch-dog group) from 2003-2012

""We recognize and define racism as micro and macro acts of harm, power, and violence against Black, Indigenous, and other non-white people across the globe.

...and plenty of others, too.

**Grants Given Outside of the United States**

**You jump back to page 34**, and you can see they spent $32 million on Program Services... okay, fair enough, they gotta spend money to keep the website running globally beyond just core staff.

**But then, you get to Page 35 - Grants and Other Assistance to Organizations or Entities Outside the United States** (the same sorts of grants as I listed above), and details aren't required.

The money they spent, and to whom the grants were given, is hidden behind the meaningless phrase ""Further Mission"" listed as its purpose.

**$17 million+ more in grants similar to the above** were given out to similar groups globally, with no transparency at all.

**Then you get to page 37 - Grants and Other Assistance to Individuals Outside of the United States**

* **$2.2 million+ given to 216 unidentified individuals (approx $10K each) to ""Further Mission"" - whatever that means.** Except based on the US grants they had to report detail on, I think we know exactly what it means.
* **Perhaps most ridiculous of all - $715K spent to bring 378 ""scholarship recipients"" to Wikimania**, **the Wikipedia conference which can be attended virtually.** I'm sure this is exactly what people thought their money was going to be spent on when they donated.

The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.  

-----------------------



Rigoberto's Taco Shop (Redmond), Redmond, Score: **62** (12/13) (lowest score in a long time)

Sunriver Lodge Restaurant / Owls Nest Pub, Sunriver, Score: 84 (12/11)




-----------------------
 

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

📣 Meet Jack, the Waiter With a Dream 🌟

“I’m tired of working for tips while watching others build wealth. $YOUTH isn’t just another coin—it’s a movement. A group of people lifting each other up, sharing resources, and building a future together.”

Today, Jack is no longer just a waiter. He’s part of a generational wealth revolution. 🌍 The $YOUTH community showed him that it’s not just about the money—it’s about who you build with.

Here are some highlights of grants given inside of the US (found beginning on page 46):

**$1,487,648** given to the [Tides Foundation](https://www.tides.org/)

* ""Tides is a nonprofit and philanthropic organization dedicated to advancing social justice.""
* ""Everything we do starts with justice. Without it, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives appear equitable without actually working to dismantle the harmful power dynamics inherent in traditional philanthropy.""
* Previously backed by George Soros
* Backed Media Matters (left-wing media watch-dog group) from 2003-2012
* Donated over $1 million to anti-Israel groups in 2023
* Manages the multimillion-dollar [Wikimedia Endowment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation#Wikimedia_Endowment) itself

**$381,685** given to [Art + Feminism, Inc](https://artandfeminism.org/)

""Art+Feminism builds a community of activists that is committed to closing information gaps related to gender, feminism, and the arts, beginning with Wikipedia.""

""What is Art+Feminism? We envision dismantling supremacist systems and creating pathways for everyone to participate in writing (and righting) history. From coffee shops and community centers to the largest museums and universities in the world, Art+Feminism leads a do-it-yourself and do-it-with-others campaign that teaches people of all gender identities and expressions to edit Wikipedia.""

""We recognize and define racism as micro and macro acts of harm, power, and violence against Black, Indigenous, and other non-white people across the globe. As a colonial system, centered in maintaining and protecting whiteness, racism permeates our societies through antagonism, exclusion, and disenfranchisement – acts and processes that reduce quality of life and produce premature death.""

**$196,434** given to [Whose Knowledge?](https://whoseknowledge.org/)

* ""We are a global campaign to center the knowledge of marginalized communities (the majority of the world) on the internet.""
* ""Technology is a feminist issue and an issue for all feminists. It is implicitly and explicitly embedded in gender-based violence, state surveillance, war and genocide, and many more issues affecting womxn, LGBTQIAP+ persons, and communities""
* ""Our podcast Whose Voices? brings together conversations with incredible activists and change-makers to re-imagine and re-design the internet together. This year’s season is focused on decolonizing structured data, diving deeper into these systems.""

...and plenty of others, too.

**Grants Given Outside of the United States**

**You jump back to page 34**, and you can see they spent $32 million on Program Services... okay, fair enough, they gotta spend money to keep the website running globally beyond just core staff.

**But then, you get to Page 35 - Grants and Other Assistance to Organizations or Entities Outside the United States** (the same sorts of grants as I listed above), and details aren't required.

The money they spent, and to whom the grants were given, is hidden behind the meaningless phrase ""Further Mission"" listed as its purpose.

**$17 million+ more in grants similar to the above** were given out to similar groups globally, with no transparency at all.

**Then you get to page 37 - Grants and Other Assistance to Individuals Outside of the United States**

* **$2.2 million+ given to 216 unidentified individuals (approx $10K each) to ""Further Mission"" - whatever that means.** Except based on the US grants they had to report detail on, I think we know exactly what it means.
* **Perhaps most ridiculous of all - $715K spent to bring 378 ""scholarship recipients"" to Wikimania**, **the Wikipedia conference which can be attended virtually.** I'm sure this is exactly what people thought their money was going to be spent on when they donated.

","I've been using [Attapoll](https://attapoll.app/join/tnuku) for many years now and I've had a very positive experience.  
It's a mobile app where you get paid for sharing your opinion and completing short surveys (usually 20 minutes max).

Cashing out is really easy and quick. You can use Revolut, Paypal or choose from various giftcards. I personally cashout through Revolut because the payout threshold is just 2.5 euros.

You won't make tons of money using the app, but trust me, if you keep doing surveys here and there, the money does add up! It basically pays for my coffee.

When you download it, make sure to visit the settings and complete your profile so you get more surveys. Also, tap on ""Notifications"" and enable ""short surveys"" and ""long surveys"". For Notification Frequency, tap ""As many as possible"". You can also enter the code ""tnuku"" as an invitation code in the settings to start with a small bonus :)

If interested, you can download the app here!

Camp 98.7 is founded
3050s-3060s

Before the destruction of Earth

At some point, a Worker Drone named Cyn would be discarded by the Elliotts and left at the bottom of a corpse pile of discarded drones.
Sometime within a five-year period, Cyn self-reboots due to improper disposal; allowing a hostile entity known as the Absolute Solver to infect her. However, Cyn's consciousness is immediately discarded by the Solver.
Serial Designation N, V, and J are disassembled as Worker Drones but later salvaged and repaired by Tessa.
The three drones serve as maids and servants at Elliott Manor.
Tessa repairs ""Cyn"" and introduces her to the other drones.
As time went on, due to her imperfectness and Tessa's parents' dislike of her repaired Worker Drones, Cyn was often locked up in the basement, where she performed many experiments on different drone bodies while being possessed by the Absolute Solver.
The gala premieres.
Not too long before, V and many other Worker Drones become comatose due to ""Error 606"", rendering them immobile and unaware of their surroundings.
Having been fed up with the mistreatment of Worker Drones, the Absolute Solver, disguised as Cyn, slaughters every human attending the gala and erases N's memories.
Before the massacre, Cyn warned Tessa to stay away from the gala because she was the only human who loved and cared for her.
Humans investigate the massacre at Elliott Manor.
Tessa was the sole survivor, but her forearm was severed.
The Absolute Solver repairs and upgrades the Worker Drones that Tessa had repaired into bloodthirsty-killing machines known as Disassembly Drones.
Tessa dies at some point and the Solver merges her corpse with Cyn's body, creating a drone-human hybrid.
The Absolute Solver releases the Disassembly Drones, instigating a global massacre on Earth. It later destroys the planet by turning the planet's core into a black hole.
The Solver's arrival at Copper 9

Humans on Copper 9 witness the massacre at Elliott Manor and the following destruction of Earth, so they try to investigate more into the matter by experimenting with the Absolute Solver. However, they unintentionally spread it, with more drones being infected, like Nori Doorman and Yeva. Yeva had a fix that did not allow her to take the program's influence over her.
The humans create Sentinels to guard Cabin Fever Labs.
The Absolute Solver takes full control of Nori, causing her to kill humans and create a massive crater in Cabin Fever Labs, leading to the core of the planet. Yeva stops the influence of the program in Nori's body with a Crucifix Patch, then cuts off her hand which has a small black hole. Unfortunately, an arm with a small black hole falls into the core of the Copper 9 and causes the core to collapse, wiping out all biological life on the planet. Nori and Yeva escape from the lab.
At some point during Nori's rebellion, the Sentinels were ordered to kill any drone on sight.
After the collapse, the Worker Drones pick up where the humans left off. It was also around this time that the Absolute Solver sent the Disassembly Drones to Copper 9 for the extermination of all Worker Drones. Nori marries Khan and creates Uzi. Yeva and her husband create Doll. Both Uzi and Doll also inherit their respective mothers' Absolute Solver.
Alice and many other drones were trapped in labs. Alice began to hate Nori because she had abandoned her.
Over time, Nori begins to see the plans of the Absolute Solver, she asks Khan to build doors to protect themselves from the approaching ""sky demons"".
The arrival of the Disassembly Drones

The Disassembly Drones touch down on Copper 9, causing a huge planet-wide genocide. The Absolute Solver brainwashed the Disassembly Drones into thinking that they were sent by JCJenson to destroy the rogue Worker Drones.
As per their directive, the Disassembly Drones construct giant spires made of Worker Drone corpses all across the planet. They are also ordered to locate and enter Cabin Fever Labs to find Crucifix Patch and destroy it.
Many Disassembly Drones successfully located and entered the Labs, but all were massacred by the Sentinels at the entrance.
Alice manages to trap all the Sentinels in a room and fends for herself in the Labs as a scavenger. She harvests the Disassembly Drones' corpses, stealing their cores, arms, and tails for her use. At some point, she finds Beau and modifies him with those parts too.
Uzi's mother, Nori was killed by an unknown Disassembly Drone, it is implied that N killed her.
Nori's core manages to survive and returns to Cabin Fever Labs. Khan believes she is dead.
The Worker Defense Force is founded.
Khan Doorman builds gigantic blast doors for Outpost 3, hoping to protect the Worker Drones.

Shortly before the events of the series

V kills Doll's parents in front of her eyes, Doll then activates the Absolute Solver.
3071

Pilot

Uzi presents to her class the Worker Drones' current predicament and how she is unhappy with her father Khan's plans.
She also demonstrates her railgun. However, it explodes, causing her to go to the infirmary to seek medical treatment.
In the infirmary, Uzi talks to Thad about her plan to sneak into the Murder Drone lair to retrieve the last part of her railgun.
At 3:00 AM, Uzi prepares to sneak out but is interrupted by her father.
Uzi lies about wanting to join the WDF so she can convince her dad to let her exit the outpost, which works.
Uzi goes out into the wasteland of Copper 9 to retrieve the last part of her railgun, which is located in a Corpse Spire.
Uzi encounters N at the landing pod. 
They fight, with Uzi emerging victorious, blasting N's head off with her railgun.
N's head regenerates but has no prior recollection of the fight and assumes Uzi is a Disassembly Drone.
Uzi and N enter the landing pod to heal Uzi's sting wound.
N talks to Uzi about his other squad mates, V and J.
Uzi realizes that the landing pod is a spaceship, and if they fix it, they can leave Copper 9.
Uzi gives N a revelation about his goal of wiping out all Worker Drones, asking him if he knows what will happen after the Disassembly Drones complete the extermination.
V and J return, with Uzi leaving the landing pod just before they enter the Corpse Spire.
J reboots N with a slap to the face, causing him to recover his memories of what had happened.
N finds out that he was talking to a Worker Drone, who is armed with a dangerous weapon and goes off to pursue them.
Uzi manages to run back to the colony, but before she can fully close the door, N pries the door open midway.
N forces every blast door to open by destroying the master control panel with his acidic tail, and proceeds to massacre the WDF workers currently situated there.
Khan suddenly appears and witnesses the destruction caused by N, thinking Uzi did it.
N ambushes both of them.
Before Uzi can shoot N, he pins her to a wall and throws her railgun aside. 
Uzi tries to convince her dad to retrieve her railgun and shoot N with it, but he retreats out of fear and abandons her. He shuts the blast door behind him and sounds the alarm.
V and J managed to enter the colony now that the doors were unlocked, congratulating N. N quickly throws Uzi out of sight.
V crawls through a vent to reach the workers as J and N talk.
N asks J about their true purpose, but J sees this as a sign of treason and implants a virus on him before leaving.
Uzi comes out of hiding to see a dying N, who apologizes.
Uzi initially wants to leave N there but decides not to.
V and J manage to find the workers' evacuation spot. V also injures Thad in the process.
N and Uzi confront V and J.

Heartbeat

N gets a dream about the Elliott Manor.
He wakes up in a cold sweat and falls onto the snow.
Uzi asks him to enter the landing pod.
In the landing pod, Uzi's Absolute Solver instinctively shatters a mirror.
V smugly comments on it, leading to a minor argument.
N enters the landing pod, and Uzi places a badge on his cap, telling him that he is the pilot of the pod.
N is initially jubilated by this fact but quickly becomes horrified after realizing that he was the one who crashed the pod.
N questions Uzi if going to Earth to enact genocide on all humans is ""morality.""
Uzi responds that they modified V and N's memories, cut contact with them, and were way past the point of negotiation.
V lashes out, saying that Uzi ""missed the negotiations"" and that her kind is not as innocent as she says.
N pulls Uzi away from V to prevent a quarrel from happening while questioning who was giving them orders from the communication relay.
Uzi pouts, saying that N is just ""complicating her murder plan.""
At some point, V breaks her chains and meets up with Lizzy, but returns to the pod periodically to avoid suspicion.
Tim and Frank are at the evacuation spot, looking at the large hole N made in the ceiling.
Tim tells ""Ladderbot 5000"" (Frank) to fix it due to it being a security risk. Despite Frank's wishes, Tim turns off all the lights.
As Frank tries to fix the hole, he hears something and goes over to investigate.
The initially dormant Solver awakens inside J's deceased body, transforming the corpse into an abomination. Frank is killed in the process.
Meanwhile, at the parent-teacher conference,
Uzi's teacher tells Khan that his daughter has been absent from class.
Khan thinks nothing of it, saying that she's just being an angsty teen like he was when he was younger.
The teacher (through some flashbacks) comments about how Uzi is an outcast (potentially due to an issue in her programming).
Khan is distraught about this, but before he can make more comments, Sarah enters, reporting that an incident happened.
Uzi and N are outside.
Thad finds Uzi and gives her back her railgun, telling her about the recent disappearances and how J's corpse started moving on its own.
Uzi decides it'll be best to return to the colony.
Back inside the colony, Tim sees a hologram of Frank.
Tim makes the mistake of joining ""Frank"" at the vending machines.
Tim gets stabbed by Eldritch J, and his corpse is assimilated, his hologram joining Frank's.
Uzi, N, and Thad make it back to Outpost 3's blast doors, and they're greeted by Ron.
Ron questions if Uzi is grounded, and she replies that she was ""banished.""
Ron questions why N was following along. He gives him an apology card as a response.
Ron accepts the apology card and allows N to enter with Uzi and Thad.
Uzi, N, and Thad sneak past a warded-off murder scene.
The Detective Drone attempts to explore the crime scene further but discovers too late that her companions, the coffee mug, the corpse, and the police tapes are all holograms.
Eldritch J seizes the opportunity to kill her.
Back at the parent-teacher conference, Khan is scolding the teacher for thinking that his daughter's programming is damaged.
The teacher ignores Khan's outrage, playing solitaire on his HUD.
Lizzy, sitting at the back, jokes about the death of Doll's parents.
Lizzy sees a hologram of herself outside and approaches the door to let it in.
Doll uses her Absolute Solver to break the door to prevent Lizzy from opening it, thus saving her and foiling Eldritch J's plan to kill her.
Uzi, N, and Thad find a bunch of oil stains and a sign about the Absolute Solver.
Uzi asks N if the Absolute Solver contributed to him regrowing his head. He responds that he actively avoids thinking about it.
Uzi tries to explain what the Absolute Solver did before being silenced by N and noticing that Thad is also terrified.
A humanoid hand appears from the darkness and grabs Thad by the leg. N fires an illumination round, revealing the silhouette of a gigantic centipede.
Eldritch J tries to take Thad but fails when N cuts the hand with a ninja star. It succeeds the second time by knocking Uzi and N to the wall and grabbing Thad with its claw.
Uzi and N pursue Eldritch J, finding a hologram of Thad (which Eldritch J portrays horribly).
Uzi and N see through the disguise; Uzi throws a ninja star to free the real Thad, who invites the two to his shindig and leaves.
Eldritch J disorients Uzi by using a hologram of her dead mother.
Eldritch J also manages to capture N, creating a hologram of him for later.
Eldritch J further traumatizes Uzi by creating a hologram of her dad and pretending to kill him in front of her, stunning Uzi.
Before Eldritch J can attack Uzi, ""N"" appears and shoots Eldritch J with missiles.
""N"" convinces Uzi to give him her railgun. The hologram of N disappears, and Eldritch J destroys the railgun while pinning Uzi in place.
Before Eldritch J could eat and assimilate Uzi, the real N appeared, sawing off Eldritch J's limbs before realizing the destroyed railgun was going to explode.
N quickly grabs Uzi and flies away to avoid being caught in the blast. Eldritch J is distracted by the gun and is destroyed by the explosion.
Eldritch J's core tries to escape but gets stabbed by N's tail and collapses into a miniature black hole that floats away.
A search party led by Khan enters the Cryosleep room to investigate the explosion.
N tries to help Uzi up, but she is too traumatized to trust him. N decides to leave her be.
Khan finds Uzi, who hugs him. Khan tells the search party to look around before seeing N, who climbs out of sight.
Doll is seen at the back of the classroom with a photograph of V. She looks at the door and remembers how she saved Lizzy just now.
A robotic bug crawls up to her arm, and Doll bursts it open, licking the splattered oil off her face with a sinister grin.
V remains captive in the pod, accompanying a very saddened N. V asks why he is that way.
V's chain is broken, but she decides to stay with N.

Doll and Uzi continue to fight.
Uzi throws the microphone stand at Doll, who deflects it back at Uzi. Uzi is now immobilized as Doll barrages her with knives.

The class disembarks the vehicle, and Uzi finds a skull bracelet, similar to her own.
The bracelet she found is Doll's bracelet.
Sometime before the beginning of the episode, Uzi's father shows Uzi an old photo of Camp 98.7.
It depicts several Worker Drones, including 2 Worker Drones wearing the skull bracelets with numbers 048 and 002.
Uzi is given the bracelet she normally wears on her neck.
One of the students asks the teacher what the field trip is for, and tells him to ask Uzi.

The ground starts to shake from some 'thump'.
N adjourns his reading session to investigate.
Several books fall from the shelves, reading 'Danger, Enter, The Spooky Basement'
N disregards the books and leaves the library.
N passes the bar and has a conversation with Cyn.
Cyn brings up the gala happening later in the manor, wanting N, her adoptive brother to go with her.
N claims this is not possible.
While wiping some blood off his plate, he notices the words 'BASEMENT NOW!!! STOP IGNORING ME >:(' reflected.
N throws away the plate in shock and agrees to ask Tessa if they can come to the gala.
The pair proceed to the dining hall.
Upon arriving, they see multiple Worker Drones setting up the furniture and utensils, James is displeased with the quality of their work and kills one of them.
J and Tessa talk to each other, and Tessa tells J about her excitement about meeting new humans.
Tessa greets and hugs N, as N notices a message written on the window that once again urges him to the basement. 'WHEN U ABOUT 2 FRIKKEN DIE. SPEAK ALOUD. ID: DarkXWolf17'.
Tessa notices Cyn, and Cyn informs her that J didn't let her out of the basement again.
Tessa's mother comes over and scolds Tessa for bringing out the (broken) drones and demanding the removal of the drones.

Before Louisa can act, N deflects the blame for her behavior to him instead.

He believes this is a sleepover, despite Uzi's allegations saying otherwise.
Uzi locks him out with Absolute Solver and retakes control of the crow.
//Past Memories

Uzi and N arrive at the manor, and they find V standing still, deactivated.

Uzi informs him that if they leave, these memories will be erased, and these memories are significant to her and him.
N refuses to move closer but is pulled by Uzi.
N moves the inert drone, and lifts the rug, revealing the basement is locked.
After a realization that J is in possession of the key, they hear a giggle.
They turn around and look at V, who is smiling and wielding a claw hand.
In Tessa's room, J is trying to bite through Tessa's chains to free her.
Once she is successful, the two leave to stop Cyn from killing everyone at the gala.

In the world of outdoor adventures, the right gear can significantly impact your experience.  For enjoying hot coffee at sunrise or a refreshing cold drink after a long hike, a reliable, portable, and insulated mug is essential. The **GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug** emerges as a strong contender, boasting a blend of features designed for backpackers and campers. This review delves into its strengths and weaknesses to help you decide if it's the ultimate camping companion for you.

## Product Overview: A Detailed Look at the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug

The GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug prioritizes functionality and durability. Crafted from clear, tough, BPA-free, non-leaching polypropylene, it's safe for outdoor use and allows for easy measurement of your liquid inside.  The outer sleeve is now made from wholly recycled RPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate), reflecting GSI Outdoors' commitment to sustainability.  This mug offers a generous capacity of up to 591ml (20 fl oz), sufficient for multiple refills.

Its design features contribute to its practicality:

* **Insulated Sleeve:**  Provides better-than-expected temperature retention, keeping your beverages hot or cold for extended periods.
* **Secure Lid:** Prevents spills and keeps out pesky insects.
* **Non-Slip Base:** Ensures stability on uneven surfaces.
* **Dishwasher Safe:**  Easy cleaning is a key feature, although occasional scrubbing of the insulating sleeve is recommended.

The mug itself weighs a lightweight 62g, but the total weight with the sleeve is 108g.


## Pros and Cons: Weighing the Advantages and Disadvantages

The Infinity Backpacker Mug offers several compelling advantages:

* **Lightweight:** At 62g (mug only), it minimizes pack weight, a crucial factor for backpackers.
* **Excellent Insulation:**  Keeps drinks hotter or colder longer than many comparable mugs.
* **Secure Lid:** The lid remains firmly in place, preventing accidental spills.
* **Easy Cleaning:** Dishwasher safe (with the aforementioned caveat for the sleeve).


However, some drawbacks need consideration:

* **Sleeve Stability:** The mug shows a tendency to slide out of the cloth holder, especially after prolonged use.  This can be frustrating during hikes.
* **Weight Compared to Alternatives:** While lightweight for an insulated mug, some alternatives weigh less.  The added weight of the insulating sleeve is a factor to consider.


## User Experience and Real-World Testing

The Infinity Backpacker Mug has been rigorously tested by countless backpackers on challenging trails, including the Appalachian Trail.  User feedback consistently highlights its ability to maintain beverage temperature effectively, even in demanding conditions. The easy-to-clean design is also frequently praised.

While some users reported the insulating sleeve loosening over time, this issue seems easily resolved with occasional scrubbing or, in severe cases, some reinforcement with a durable tape.  The lack of a carrying handle is also sometimes mentioned, but many users find the weight and size manageable without one.


## Design Improvements Over Time: A History of Refinement

GSI Outdoors has continuously refined the Infinity Backpacker Mug design.  Early versions lacked internal measurement markings, a feature subsequently added in response to user feedback.  More recently, GSI has transitioned to wholly recycled materials for the sleeve, increasing the capacity slightly to 550ml while enhancing sustainability. These improvements demonstrate a commitment to customer needs and environmental responsibility.


## Industry Comparison and Market Analysis: How Does it Stack Up?

The market for insulated camping mugs is fiercely competitive, with brands like MSR, Primus, and Stanley offering similar products.  The Infinity Backpacker Mug distinguishes itself through its combination of lightweight design, relatively good insulation, and a reasonable price point.  GSI Outdoors' established reputation for high-quality outdoor gear further enhances its appeal. The key differentiator is often the weight versus insulation balance, with some users prioritizing extreme lightness over slightly reduced insulation.


## Addressing Pain Points and Common Questions

Several common concerns regarding portable camping mugs are directly addressed by the Infinity Backpacker Mug:

* **Durability:**  While the insulating sleeve may loosen over time, this is manageable through simple maintenance. The mug itself is quite robust.
* **Portability:**  The lightweight design makes it ideal for backpacking, though users should consider the trade-off with other ultra-light options.
* **User Comfort:** The simple design is generally comfortable to hold, even for extended periods.  The non-slip base adds to this comfort.


## Conclusion and Recommendation

The GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug presents a compelling option for backpackers and campers seeking a balance between lightweight portability, effective insulation, and ease of use.  While the sliding sleeve issue is a valid concern,  it doesn’t necessarily negate the mug's overall value.  Its eco-friendly design and GSI Outdoors' reputation contribute to its appeal.  If weight is your absolute top priority, you might explore ultra-light alternatives, but for many users, the Infinity Backpacker Mug offers a solid compromise between weight and performance.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How durable is the insulating sleeve?**

A: The insulating sleeve tends to loosen over time with repeated use and washing.  Regular scrubbing can help maintain its integrity, and in some cases, reinforcement with durable tape might be necessary.

**Q:  Can I use the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug with hot liquids?**

A: Yes, the mug is designed for both hot and cold beverages.  The insulated sleeve helps maintain temperature effectively.

**Q: Is the Infinity Backpacker Mug completely leakproof?**

A:  The lid is designed to prevent spills and leaks under normal use. However, extreme jostling or dropping could potentially lead to leakage.

**Q: How does the Infinity Backpacker Mug compare to other insulated camping mugs?**

A: The Infinity Backpacker Mug offers a good balance of weight, insulation, and price.  Ultra-light options exist, but they often compromise on insulation.  Heavier mugs may offer better insulation but increase pack weight.  The best choice depends on individual priorities.

**Q: Where can I purchase the GSI Outdoors Infinity Backpacker Mug?**

A: The mug is widely available online through various retailers specializing in outdoor gear, as well as in many physical outdoor stores.

i got a switch for christmas, and have been trying to brew something with it for the past few days, unfortunately leaving me with bitter or sour or just generally really wrong tasting coffee. i've been grinding my beans on c3s pro alternating between 14, 15 and 16 clicks - i've got a lighter and a medium roast, and i've been trying to find a good enough setting for each, but with no success. i'm relatively new to coffee, and apart from working at a commercial cafe, had never done ANYTHING - besides religiously watching james hoffmann lol. i've been trying to replicate his switch method, but again, something is going wrong and i can't just figure out what.
any advice will be helpful.

My partner and I are moving to Hanoi early 2025, and we couldn’t be more excited. I’ve accepted a job there with a good salary, plus housing allowance and annual flights home. It’s a big upgrade from what I earn in the UK, and the overall package feels incredibly generous. 
We’ve never been to Vietnam, but we’ve been devouring everything we can about the country – the food, the culture, the coffee – it all looks amazing. 

We have a few questions if anyone can help answering them for us please 🙏🏼 

1- How is the weather in Hanoi? Are outdoor activities still enjoyable, or do we primarily stay indoors? We live in the wettest city in England and it just rains nonstop for weeks, very grey and depressing which makes most outdoor activities not very enjoyable. 

2- We’ll be living at Ocean Park which looks incredible! How is it living there are there enough amenities. I’ll be working somewhere near there. 

3- The flat given looks like on a high floor (20th floor). Are there any concerns regarding noise levels or air quality living in a tall building in Hanoi?""

4- What opportunities are there for outdoor adventure activities near Ocean Park, such as hiking, cycling, or water sports?

5- We have lived in the Middle East, Japan, New Zealand and the UK and we are used to extreme heat, high humidity, cold winters, typhoon and gal force. As well as sand, snow and thunder storms. The one that depresses us most is grey clouds and continues rain where the sun is nonexistent for weeks! How would you compare the climate and living conditions in Hanoi to any of those?

6- Is it easy to make local friends, we started learning Vietnamese and as a mixed m-culture couple we are very open to meeting people from everywhere. 

7- we have no dietary requirements and very adventurous when it comes to food. We have taken all the vaccinations required and we have a good health insurance. Does it take long for your stomach to get used to the food without having an upset stomach?

8- just an observation, all the apartments they showed us online have no oven and a small kitchen. Is that because eating out is easy? We can’t afford eating out daily in the UK. ",3,1735304878.0,VietNam,5,0.8,False

But can an at-home kit really deliver the same results as professional treatments? I recently tried one of these kits to find out, and I’m sharing my full experience for anyone considering giving it a shot.

# Why I Chose an At-Home Whitening Kit

Professional teeth whitening is effective but comes with two major downsides: cost and sensitivity. Spending hundreds of dollars for a brighter smile isn’t always practical, and my past experiences with in-office treatments left my teeth feeling painfully sensitive. That’s why I decided to try a whitening kit that promised professional-level results at home with minimal discomfort.

I was particularly drawn to this kit because it used a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** and an **LED mouthpiece**, which seemed like a step up from the usual strips and toothpaste.

# How It Works

The kit’s process was surprisingly straightforward:

1. **Preparation**: Brush and dry your teeth to remove surface debris and allow the gel to stick better.
2. **Application**: Use the applicator pen to apply a thin, even layer of whitening gel to your teeth.
3. **LED Activation**: Insert the LED mouthpiece, which connects via USB, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, rinse your mouth and clean the device for the next use.

The whole process took less time than making a cup of coffee, which was a huge plus for my busy schedule.

# My Results: Day-by-Day Breakdown

* **Day 1**: After my first session, I didn’t notice any dramatic changes, but my teeth felt cleaner. The gel didn’t taste bad, and the mouthpiece was comfortable.
* **Day 3**: By the third day, I could see subtle improvements. The surface stains from coffee and tea were starting to fade.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the six-day cycle, my teeth were noticeably brighter—around 6 shades lighter. The results looked natural, not overdone, which was exactly what I wanted.

The best part? I experienced **no sensitivity** at any point, which was a refreshing change from other whitening products I’ve tried.

# What Makes This Kit Different?

Here’s what stood out to me about this whitening kit:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The whitening gel was designed to deliver results without causing irritation or enamel damage.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece activated the gel, helping it penetrate deeper into the enamel for more effective stain removal.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Storage**: The gel was stored in controlled conditions, ensuring it remained fresh and potent when it arrived.

Many over-the-counter options don’t offer these features, which likely explains why this kit worked so well for me.

Check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

Having tried a range of whitening products in the past, here’s how this kit stacks up:

* **Whitening Strips**: These are convenient but often cause uneven results and sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Great for maintaining results but not strong enough to remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and often uncomfortable.

This kit felt like the perfect middle ground—it delivered professional-level results at a fraction of the cost and without the sensitivity.

# Who Should Try an At-Home Whitening Kit?

This kit is ideal for:

* People with sensitive teeth who struggle with harsher whitening products.
* Coffee or tea drinkers who want to remove stubborn stains.
* Anyone looking for a more affordable alternative to professional treatments.

If you’re willing to commit to a simple daily routine for six days, the results are well worth it.

# Tips for Success

If you decide to try an at-home whitening kit, here are some tips to maximize your results:

* **Stick to the Routine**: Consistency is key to achieving noticeable results.
* **Avoid Staining Foods**: Cut back on coffee, tea, and wine during the whitening process.
* **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brushing and flossing regularly will help keep your teeth bright and stain-free.

# Final Thoughts

At-home teeth whitening has come a long way, and this kit proves that you don’t need to visit a dentist to achieve a brighter smile. It’s easy to use, gentle on sensitive teeth, and delivers results in less than a week.

1hneavv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hneavv/i_hate_a_lot_of_my_family_for_the_emotional_abuse/,I hate a lot of my family for the emotional abuse I received as a child ,"So this is a throwaway for some obvious reasons.

I (NB24) can't bond with people because of Trauma I guess. I wanna get rid of it, am working on it and hope writing it out will help me get a better grip on it. This is written on module so pardon the formatting and English ain't my first language so excuse some errors please.

I was raised by my mother after my father cheated on her with his secretary (cliché, I know, but he ain't the brightest) and was with him every other weekend. He also married her, I'll call her StepMom (SM) from this point on. My mother and I lived in a apartment building my grandma owned for almost no rent while my father had his own bakery he rented, together with an apartment.

I wanna start with a bit of stuff about my father. When I was over we mostly just did some stuff that was fun for me in the first few years. I think I was about 5 when my memories started with him. We sometimes went to a boardgame museum, some amusement park or we're just driving to a playground and sometimes we even got McDonald's after a long day there. Those times I remember mostly good. Later on when I became a teenager we almost never did anything cool anymore. I also didn't sleep at his place after I was 12 or so anymore. We mainly cleaned his fishtank together, or changed tires, or cleaned his garage. Mostly stuff that noone wants to do or at least likes to do. Eventually around 13-14 or so I didnt go to his place anymore since I didn't like it anymore. I'd say he tried, not his best but he did. Ome memory I remember fondly is of us going to ""James Bond 007: Skyfall"" as it was released with a coupon I got for my birthday. Halfway through the movie there was a pause because it was extra long and we got out of the cinema only for him to tell me that his twilight movie show at a different cinema would start soon. I got really sad, mostly because of the coupon since my mother and I didn't really had a lot of money to spend for that stuff, but also because we began a movie and my father would prioritise another movie with his friends over time with me. He gave me the money for the coupon back but I should not tell my mom anything about it. I didn't until about 8-10 years later. I also remember finding condoms in his car since he kept them in a candy box, a bit weird if you transport a child around, but hey, as mentioned not the brightest. This also lead to me believing he cheated, I never mentioned it to anyone since this was no proof but my belief does stand till today because of some other stuff as well which we will come to later. Looking back I never really felt like he loved me truly or was ever happy I was over, which as well somehow kills my self esteem a bit.

Onto my Mom, the best person I still have. She cared for me, was loving, tried to help when I was down and even got me out of school when I was feeling sick because of Latin lesson (I never learned for vocabulary tests which were at the beginning of each lesson). She supported my hobbies, got me great education and even learned a new job aside. Of course my grandma also supported us with that but I'm nonetheless Hella proud of my Mom for doin it. The only thing that somewhat grinds my gears is the move to another city because of my now stepdad. Cool guy, but at the time I really didn't understand it and it really destroyed my drive to do anything since I had seemingly no control of anything at the time. My grades were bad, my class a bunch of assholes who couldn't handle the fact that I wouldn't mob someone (had a lot of mobbing behind me) to fit in and my interests were scarce, to say the least. She also had a boyfri Nd before my now stepdad, who was an manchild. He lives next to his Mother, got food from her, couldn't handle a child around him and I also just got the feeling he was an asshole. As explanation, my mom once broke her arm while driving scooter. This day I came home from school, noticing my mom wasn't home as usual but her Boyfriend was. I asked him where she were and he only said she had an accident and if she would die I'd go into an orphanage. I just ran into my room and cried, she later called home and told me but I was just emotionally finished. He as well just turned the TV off when I wanted to watch with him. He was in general giving me the feeling I'd be a nuisance. I only noticed later that what he did was actual emotional abuse, not only to me but my mom as well as I heard later.

Now onto the reason I make this post, my SM. Cliché again, I know, but I hate her with every cell of my still living body. She was the kind of person who hates all children except of her own and I felt it. Whenever I spent the weekend with my dad I would feel it, I always had to eat up, no matter the portion she put on my plate nor if the food would taste. I know I should be happy we always had food and so on, and I am! But fuck her with the way she told me to eat up. Needed to go on toilet? Eat up first! You had enough baked dove? Too bad still stuff on the plate. You want something to drink? Eat up, no matter if it's dry as hell. You don't like this way too overcooked zucchini? Too bad you gotta eat up. Most of the times it ended in me crying, getting yelled at by SM and eventually getting support from Dad to not having to eat up. When my half sister was born she got a lot of stuff. I was for sure somewhat jealous and honestly I think that's understandable as a kid. I was never bad towards her, nor was I ever really close to her. She wanted a Playground in the garden? She got one. She wanted toys from the flea market when we went there? SM always got her the stuff, I was only second thought if at all. I know that's somewhat normal with the own children and stepchildren but it still built some resentment. Now to the nights I slept at their place. One would imagine I could sleep on the bed couch but nope, only a small foam mattress for the child. I had a night where I neede to pee, so I want to the bathroom, only for SM to come out of their room to yell at me for making too much noise because of the squeaking door handle. I literally feared needing to go to toilet at night at their place to the point where I rather peed in the potted plant than risking to wake anyone up. Also since my dad owned his own bakery his sleeping times never aligned with mine so I had to stay in the living room on the mattress till i was tired about 2 hours later. Mostly okay cause I had my NintendoDS though. I once broke a coffee can and got yelled at for it. I remember fondly because it was the kind of yelling that would induce tears and me running away from SM. I hate her for making me scared as a kid already. I always felt as if I was a nuisance in her surroundings. She never hugged me as a child, never even got really close to me. I peed my pants a number of times at their place because of it and one day I told my mom I wouldn't want to stay over there anymore. Just to keep in mind that was when I was around 7-9ish years old. We had a lengthy chat about it and she again with my dad later. I don't really remember the ending of it, only that after my dad got a second store I wouldn't sleep at their place anymore. I still hate her for it. I try to keep any contact with her at the bare minimum, the last time we saw each other she was just condescending of my hobbies and otherwise just avoided me as she could. I truly want to scream at her by now.

Any family on my father's side is either annoying, I really can't care about them, or they just dont care bout me. I had my dad a few times at my place when he needed help with technical stuff but always avoided politics since we WILL argue once we get to that. My grandma on his side is dearly but I can't really stand her for bein just a husk of a person. No depth when talking with her nor any interest in anything but watching TV.

Family on my mother's side was mostly okayish. Grandma was a bit naiv but really smart and nice. She died cause she didn't ever stop smoking but left us with debt after she fell for a lovescam in Turkey. My aunt is a esoteric Christian who is anti Vax which makes me really not very interested in her. My grandpa on that side is an egoistic asshole most of the time, who you can't argue with. Last time I saw him was when I was around 13-14 years old and he just made me cry because he yelled at me for not wanting to wear a way too large costume I didn't like for carnival.

To get to now: I can't really open up to anyone since I always think I might just be annoying. I found a friend group a few months ago, which I dearly adore, but I don't know how to really connect with them other than our meetings. Every time I think I could send someone some funny stuff I just remind myself that if they don't find it funny I might just get noticed as annoying or unfitting and getting cast out. I fear the consequences of inaction, but can't act cause of fear of being a nuisance. It's a circle I want to break out. But doing that is easier said than done. I was in therapy for social anxiety for about 2-3 Years which helped but I really feel like I got a long way ahead of me. I just want to truly 
bond with people and feel like I got the chance just to do that right now. I hope they are patient and keep assuring that I belong to them as they did a few times by now. I am really happy I found them and hope this will last for a long time.

The cups I've brewed all seem to leave a very sour/sweet after taste that is making it quite unpleasant to drink. The coffee lacks bitterness so I've tried going a bit finer but there isn't much difference. I'm using the Santa Elena beans from Origin Coffee in the UK.

I'm using a Fellow Ode Gen 1 as my grinder, with the following settings:

Single cup /w Medium Profile: Ground at setting 2/2.1 

Small batch /w Medium profile: Ground at setting 5 

  
Both of these approaches produce a similar taste. I've also tried a profile with two pulses and the coffee was very weak but still had that sour taste. Any tips or should I just upgrade my burrs in my Ode?",2,1735304185.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

After a lot of thought (and countless coffee-fueled mornings), I realized something: how great would it be to wake up, sip your coffee, and dive straight into your favourite newspaper on your Kindle? No fuss, no extra clicks—just automated goodness. 📖✨

As a software developer who *loves* automating life’s little tasks, I’ve successfully built a service that automatically sends me my favourite newspapers **via email** straight to my Kindle every morning. 💻🚀

To make this happen for all of you, all I'd ask is:  
1️⃣ Add the service's email address as an approved recipient in your Amazon account & tell me what newspapers you'd like to read.  
2️⃣ Next sit back, relax, and let the news come to you! 🌟

**Note**: I plan to make this service entirely **FREE** for as long as I can and for as many people as the servers can hold themselves up for. I'd keep visiting this post and start this service by 7th of January 2025 for everyone interested. 💬 Would you use something like this? What features would make it a must-have for you? If you'd vote below, that'll give me a fair idea for scaling this app. At the end, if it works, it works for everyone : )

I have never been pregnant. I need to remind myself that I truly don't know what she's going through.  

  

I'm still furious at her because she did almost everything wrong when it comes to her pregnancy and now her callousness is probably going to cost her her baby's life.   
First she planned her baby all by herself without informing her then fling that's she's trying to get pregnant. This is just speculation, I have no proof she didn't plan it with him, just that he was very surprised when she told him she's pregnant. 
She lives with our dad.
My little two year old niece (my middle sisters kid) found a paper bag *filled* with negative pregnancy tests and pills to help with fertility. She denied it was for pregnancy, just that that was the way to check if she had some bacteria???!  

  
Her boyfriend is 21, she's 31. They work together at a fast food chain.
 Then she went on medical leave to protect her pregnancy because the gynecologist saw that she has a thin placenta. Was told to take it easy. This is in Europe so not uncommon.
That was on the 1st of October. Since then she went to Italy, Austria, Slovakia, even to a spa in Slovenia and was planning on renting a lodge in the mountains for New Years. She drove to all those places, which means the spent hooours sitting in a car. 
She has had bacterial infections for years now and refuses to wear anything but synthetic thongs. Even now, at 30 weeks pregnant.  

  She drinks two to three pots of turkish coffee every day, as late at 7PM. 

  

If I told her I don't think it's a good idea do drive that long, or to drink coffee she just shut me down and started yelling. Same as with our other sister, or dad.

And now she's in the hospital, because she has breached and has contractions. The doctors asked her if she was taking it easy on herself; she said she was cleaning the last few days so that must be it.

  

She's scared shitless of losing her baby, and I just want to shake her and scream at her. She's so stupid, I just can't. Everything was more important than taking care of herself properly, it mattered more to her that her boyfriend got her a Hugo Boss bathrobe than making sure she was doing what was good for the baby THAT SHE PLANNED FOR!

  

I can't yell at her, so I'm yelling here.

1hne5gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/1hne5gm/job_hunting_and_gearing_up_for_2025/,Job hunting and gearing up for 2025.,"Nitong November, pagkalipas ng Undas weekend, I was let go from a job after 4 months working as a store crew ng isang kilalang dessert shop. Although inclined to rest muna ang enjoy the holidays, I thought to start job hunting already as soon as around 2nd half of that month. Taken into consideration na magiging busy na mga companies for the holiday season or paubos na hiring budgets for this year or both, medj expected na magiging matumal.

Btw, HRIM grad ako with at least 2 years experience sa hospitality na mostly F&B. Apart from related hotel and F&B trainings and 5-star hotel practicum sa cost control noong college, tsaka isang pre-employment training for linen attendant sa isang hotel sa Antipolo, 1st job is service staff sa isang cafe/resto for 2 years dito rin, and the 2nd one is dining staff sa isang Singaporean cafe sa isang Ortigas mall na saglit lang. Now medj pinalawak ko na job search ko, though prefer pa rin hotels as well as kahit resto or cafe or basta anything related sa F&B or hospitality, medj open na rin sa iba pang aspects ng hospitality or even other relevant fields I may be interested in.

This month nag-apply ako supposedly for an admin assistant position for a coffee shop based in Taytay, Rizal, got invited to a sales associate role sa kanilang mother company based in Ortigas, but after a week since na-interview I received the unfortunate news of not getting the job.

As a back up plan, nag-apply na rin ako for civil service exam which is scheduled for March 2025. Just in case I would consider working for a government job. Added credential na rin siguro if maipasa ang exam, which is around May 2025 ata malalaman ang results.

Not long enough nag-apply ako sa isang residence hotel in Ortigas for a sales account executive role, saw the opening via FB through a hotel job opening related group, got interviewed as in 2 yun same day - 1 with HR and nexy is with director of sales, which seemed to go well. Waiting game sa kanilang decision until a week after new year, whether uusad pa sa final interview with the general manager, and if tuluyang matatanggap. Sales director gave me her calling card para maka-follow up ako for updates regarding my application by early January, though I sent a thank you email for inviting me sa nasabing interview to try to keep in touch with them.

Pero hindi lang yun ang hinihintay. Few days before Christmas, I was invited for an interview for a brand associate for food ng isang retail company based in BGC Taguig na inapplyan ko rin via LinkedIn. Pinapili ako whether to be interviewed on Dec 23 or Jan 2-3, since birthday ng mommy ko ung nakaraang monday, after new year celebration na lang magpa-interview. So after salubungin ang 2025, konting prep na for that as well.

May isa pang nagreply, for a hotel business development analyst role ng isang real estate company ata based in Makati. Wala pang interview pero nareceive nila ung LinkedIn application ko, was asked to submit my application thru their email, so pending pa for initial screening.

Marami-rami pang pending applications, hopefully may mag-respond na rin by January, to follow-up na lang after the holidays.

Tbh one reason to look forward to 2025. Hopefully would land a new and better job, para makaraos and eventually umasenso na rin sa buhay. All the rest bahala na si Lord. 🙏

After using a Philips LatteGo 3200 for 6 years we decided to go for a new superautomatic. The taste of the LatteGo was amazing, but maintenance terrible. At the end the whole machine had wet coffee grind over all internals, even with mold. Very inconsistent pucks.

After some Reddit research, we decided to try a DeLonghi. Eventually settled on a Dinamica Plus (still thinking of switching to Rivelia or Magnifica Plus). 

However, we are struggling to get a good tasting coffee, like our LatteGo. The (fresh) beans are the same but we cannot configure it good. Usually we like strong coffee, having it on the highest setting. But the DeLonghi already gives strong coffee at 2 beans. It has a very strong aroma, but is still very watery. 

Grind setting now is 6/7, below 3 just gives droplets of water.

TL;DR any tips how to configure a DeLonghi?

Having experienced literal home cafes in the past, I came there expecting to dine in inside the house and have a coffee chats with the barista similar to the kind of conversations you have with Joab from dream latte


To my surprise, they were only delivery basis, and the home cafe was only a pop-up to serve as a pickup point for orders 😂

But the barista was kind enough to welcome me in their porch, set up a small table and chair, and gave me a menu they had printed. They showed me their setup - manual grinding, boiling, and pressing, and they talked to me about the beans they are prepping and the method they’re going for.

They had other orders to fulfill but they took the time to sit down and chat. Their pets kept me company while waiting. It was honestly a very refreshing take on the cafe culture that I wish to have more off - the laid back setup of an actual “home” cafe, passionate baristas talking about coffee, and most especially, 3rd wave coffee in a small town like Bataan

Theme: Waiting on God: Shifting Our Focus 

Scripture: Heb. 12:1-2; Isaiah 40:31 & Ps.130:5

Message:

Waiting is a part of life. We wait in traffic on our way to and from work or school, in line at our favorite coffee shop, and for packages to arrive on our doorstep. Sometimes, waiting can be frustrating, and other times, it can be filled with great anticipation - like a young child waiting for Christmas morning.

However, most of us will do just about anything to avoid waiting. In our minds, we sometimes kick and scream and act like a two-year-old when moments of unplanned waiting inevitably creep into our day. There is just no way to avoid waiting altogether.

But what happens when we find ourselves in a season of waiting on God? When weeks, months, and even years go by, it doesn't seem like anything is happening.

Maybe our season of waiting is a desire God put in our hearts many years ago that has yet to become a reality. Or perhaps it is a future season of life that seems so much more exciting than the one we currently find ourselves in. Or maybe still, it is a dream God birthed in our minds. We can visualize a clear picture of it, but under the dark cloud of our current circumstances, we can't see how our dream could ever come to pass.

The truth is that God has a plan and a purpose for our lives, but He often only reveals it one step at a time. Henri Nouwen once wrote, ""The art of living is to enjoy what we can see and not complain about what remains in the dark. When we can take the next step with the trust that we will have enough light for the step that follows, we can walk through life with joy.""

In times of waiting, Hebrews 12:1-2 reminds us of where our focus should be, ""Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God."" (emphasis added) Truthfully, waiting on God can often feel like wandering around in a dark room alone with nowhere to focus our eyes.

Over the next few days, we will consider four ways you and I can shift our focus when we find ourselves in a season of waiting on God. Shifting our focus allows us to continue to trust in the goodness of God, even when things feel dark and uncertain. And trust in the goodness of God makes it possible to experience joy as we walk through seasons of waiting.

Its just... You will understant why when you read it. Also im gonna try to TLDR otherwise it would too long and boring i assume.

  
I have a bff, long time childhood friend, super guy love him like a brother without exaggerating it, he has a relationship over a year now. We live together, and his gf also stays time to time at us. So far so good.

Last week we had a party and my bff fall a sleep, we bring him to his bed, our regular party after, nothing weird so far. Ive made a coffee for myself and she asked if she can join, i said sure, this is also nothing weird either.

Then after we drink coffee and had a talk, i was washing the glass and was ready to go to my room, she said ""wait have this glass to"" and reached to me to give her glass and suddenly from fuckn nowhere she fuckn tried to kiss me. I freeze, like i couldnt move i couldnt think i just dodged her kiss and froze after that. She said sorry and wanted to say a few shit but i felt so bad and angry i just told her to go to her room and dont fuckn say a word to me. She said sorry and went to her room.

Im still having a red head, a fury on my head while writing this. Because i know maybe for some of you it can be weird but my bff is ACTUALLY like my fuckn lil bro. I would catch a bullet for him, just like i would for my mom, dad and lil sis. 

Then a few days after i called her when my bff wasnt at home and asked her to talk about it. She came, explained that she was drunk af (she was actually drunk af i can confirm that) and she said she had a crush on me back in uni days, not anymore ofc but at that moments she just went for a kiss, not a big deal etc. 

For me personally, i dont mind that. Look, ive been in hundreds of parties, people get drunk and then they do primal shit like an ape, i get that. I am an atheist so i also dont have those sexist or oldschool ideas or behaviour either. 

But im thinking like i think my bff needs to know this but then i feel stuck because this is not like a story where you tell ""hey man your girl tried to kiss someone when she was super drunk"", she tried to kiss ME, and im not an outsider. I will be always here, and i fear that my bff would feel discomfort around me if he learns it.

Im confused as fuck, i dont know what to do or how to behave tbh. I definetely feel like i should tell it. But on the other hand, i actually dont think she did something unbelievable, i mean for some reason i can relate to it. And im also kinda sure she doesnt have feelings for me so there is no problem from my perspective (if i felt otherwise about her feelings, then i would definetely said kick her bro but if you take my word, i believe her about it being a ""just a moment thing"").

What would you guys do? Please any advice i will appreciate because i definetely feel fucked up for a reason. I cant sleep properly, i cant stay alone with my bff because i fear i would tell him etc.

Even if im gonna tell him, i want to do it proper way. RN i dont think speaking would be my strong point, i dont wanna make him sad either. Also another point is that, i actually dont think she is a cheater in general. At least she doesnt behave like that, she was always loyal to him in my eyes at least but that fuckn move was weird.

1hndw97,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hndw97/faith_is_not_knowledge/,Faith is not Knowledge,"Good morning (or whenever you are)

[I discussed this idea verbally over a coffee this morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSPZqXbhNVM) if you prefer to engage via video/audio.

I hope all is well. Today, I am here to discuss the difference between faith and knowledge. I know the biblical definition of faith might find it's way into this conversation, so lets plant that right here:

Hebrews 11:1  
**11** Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

I want to take a moment to highlight the word ""evidence"" as I do not feel this definition lines up with how we use the word ""faith"" in practical conversation.

Let's take a look at the word evidence:

""the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or [proposition](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f94e1dc8538b051&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1103US1103&sxsrf=ADLYWIL21dbcraVSEa71zPp3uzEYyxtL6A:1735301795004&q=proposition&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Yimkyl6bef4ahpJJWZYVcH-VYFRx75N8T3wmlsxBJAmzs5CpRrTQwqIKFy-kXzE1Q0grJYnLLElWAsr02eEV5LJjTrNI%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib18b49seKAxXyJ0QIHaTbOL4QyecJegQILRAO) is true or valid.""

The definition of the word ""evidence"" helps us to see that a belief can be false, because evidence would have no meaning if all beliefs were true.

Beliefs can be false. They just can. I can believe the moon is made of cheese, but that doesn't mean it is. In order to call my belief about the moon cheese ""knowledge"" I would have to demonstrate it.

So, lets look at how the word faith is used in practical conversation. 

""I have faith he will show up."" <- does the speaker know he will show up? no.

or 

""I have faith things will work out."" <- does the speaker know things will work out? no.

So, lets try this one:

""I have faith Jesus rose from the dead."" <- does the speaker know this? no.

In order for the speaker to know such a thing, they would have to be able to demonstrate it.

Lets imagine a less dramatic scenario.

""I have faith Elvis faked his death and is still alive"" <- does the speak know this? No, but what if they said, ""I know Elvis is still alive."" How would we go about verifying this claim?

Easy, we would just demand to speak to Elvis. That would be the only way we would believe it.

But what if someone said, ""Elvis rose from the dead and ascended to Heaven""? What would it take to believe this?

What if 100s of raving Elvis fans committed suicide in conviction of their belief in the risen Elvis. Would that be enough to convince you?

I don't think anything would convince me of a risen Elvis, because there is no real way to validate or invalidate the claim.

Same goes for Jesus. We cant do anything to demonstrate a risen Jesus, all we can do is have faith. And it is a faith no one would consider evidence in a court of law.",6,1735302689.0,DebateReligion,22,1.0,False

1hndsh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hndsh5/please_help_me_fix_my_mum/,Please help me fix my mum,"Any advice or suggestions are much appreciated.

My mum is 57, she used to be active but last year she got cancer and since surgery has be going downhill. It's gotten to the point now where she can literally barely put one foot in front of the other. She's around 120kg (she was around 100 this time last year, she refuses to weigh herself so not sure). She needs someone with her to put her shoes and socks on, can barely get up and down the stairs and bend over etc, she can barely walk holding a cup of coffee. 

So she's obese, but she also has terrible and constantly deteriorating mobility. 

Now, despite this she still tries to be active, she used to push herself to go for walks around the block or go up to our field (which she can't even go to now due to her condition). She literally doesn't stop during the day, it'll take her an hour but she'll somehow manage to mop the floor and do basic cleaning things. She works remotely and continues to work which stresses her out a lot as she doesn't get on with her boss.

Now I'm 22M and currently studying in my final year of uni, every time I've come home her condition gets way worse. I'm a qualified personal trainer and have a good understanding of diet and nutrition. Earlier this year me and mum were doing online PT sessions while I'm at uni, 4x a week we'd call and I'd take her through basic strengthening etc. The aim was to get her mobility better and build some strength. After about 2 months that fizzled out, she hadn't made any improvement, then since then her condition has gotten way worse.

Now I've had great success with carnivore, I keep saying for her to go on low carb then potentially carnivore because that will help her. Growing up she lost 15kg while ketogenic so she wants to do it. But she has got such bad diet fatigue from years of yo-yo dieting and overtraining. She gets really bad food noise and I think she would eventually rebound from this diet once again as it can get tough, potentially putting her in worse health.

I beg my mum to start looking after her health, she's very sick but to start with the basics like go to bed a bit earlier or do some meditation as she's constantly stressed from work (she always falls asleep at her desk and on the sofa and when I try get her to sleep she says she's got more work to do). Now every time I ask her it feels less effective to the point where I get extremely angry at her because while I've been home I've had to do everything, but I have a bunch of work to do for uni. Obviously I don't mind helping out, but when I have to do all the work and end up sacrificing studying etc I get wound up.

My mum's boyfriend lives with her, but he is dependant on her because he can't drive so she takes him everywhere (she also is still driving somehow). He has barely any money as well so mum always pays for food etc, it's like she's his mother. He does care about her looking after her health, but lacks the discipline and knowledge himself, he's pretty lazy and not very proactive in helping her health, but if I say something he does try and enforce it on her. He also does all the basic work around the house and mum wouldn't be able to live without him.

My brother is 23 and still lives at home, he's working full time, but we never see him. It's like he avoids mum for her situation. We've fell out countless times as well because I tell him he's not doing enough but he says he's working to hard at work. Realistically he should make time for her. My sister lives away from home and is busy as well, she's taken her horse and tries to help out where she can.

No one seems to care how bad the situation is, everyone around her seems to just ignore it. It's tearing my family apart because I feel so alone with it. I sent a message into the group chat about looking after her, to which I was met with 'not this again'.

There could be something wrong with my mum, and she keeps saying she must have some sort of disease, she's been to the doctor SO many times, has a range of different tests for everything and the doctors haven't found anything wrong, I think she's chronically stressed from work and insulin resistant. That's why she's so tired and has no energy. She also has cream in her coffees and i think gets through 400-600 calories of it every morning, I think that's what's stopping her from loosing weight as she eats fairly clean but doesn't track calories. She's been told she has a vitamin B12 deficiency and had help from injections, but they're every 3 months and barely help her. I genuinely think she needs to fix her sleep, look after her stress, and go carnivore/low carb as a normal diet won't fix her now. It's also important to note money is very tight at the minute and she definitely has some trauma from her past, which adds to the stress. I've pushed it so hard onto her how bad the situation is, but she seems so far from accepting help. I've definitely made the situation worse all together as I do stress mum out. But I'm genuinely trying to help her. 

Once I go back to uni next week I know she'll just fall back into bad habits and nothing will change. I'm scared she won't be here by the time I get home in summer.

Now I want to find external help or any suggestions on how I can support her transition to better health because what I'm doing right now isn't helping. In my head I feel I can make her better, but I feel because of so many failed attempts she doesn't listen to me anymore.

My boyfriend is 29 and still lives with both his divorced parents, it feels like they either have joint custody of him (they separated when he was 20) or the relationship has crossed over into companionship. 
I don’t know why it bothers me so much but it does. 

He spends two nights a week at his mums and the rest at his dad’s. He’s constantly back and forth and it feels like he lives out of his backpack. 

He’s the middle child of three, the eldest lives locally with his wife and child and the youngest lives a few hours away so it seems he’s the free one to run around after everyone. Including his siblings and any extended family. 

His parents make plans, go away for weekends, evenings etc. and it feels like he’s just expected to be around and run back and forth to feed cats, walk dogs etc. 
Christmas Day he spent with his dad but his mum was away so he did the hour round trip to feed her cats and a two hour walk for his aunties dog. 

I know the main point here is he says he’s happy to do it, he enjoys their company and wants to help. 
I feel like that *should* be a lovely thing but from the outside looking in, I just feel he’s taken for granted because I think it’s expected that he’ll do it. 
He said he can say no if he wants but everyone knows he’s not going to. 

I’ve been on the phone to him and heard his dad say ‘you need to go to Tesco for XYZ’. Not ‘can you go?’ Or ‘if you’re passing’, it’s an out right instruction. 

I feel the relationship with his dad is still one of a parent/child. This is what we are doing and you are coming, like when his dad’s car was going in for a service and he had to go with him. Again he said he wanted to and it was an opportunity for a day out but is that not what you do with a partner, not a parent? 

Yes ok he’s happy to but when does that stop and you become a real grown up with an independent life?? 

With his mum I definitely see it as crossing some boundaries. 
She’ll cut recipes out magazines for them to try and he’ll cook them for her getting home from work. 
They’re often DIYing or crafting together but it comes across to me in a way where she’s decided this is what we’re doing this weekends the way wives spring jobs on their husbands. 
He was late setting off to come see me once because his mum’s friend came round to see her for coffee… I have no idea why that involves him but hey ho. 

He’s not working just now due to injury and so living ‘rent free’. He says his parents are just being very good to him to allow that. 
I’d argue his parents are doing what parents are supposed to do and supporting their son, but that doesn’t mean he’s indebted to them. If it was my son, yes, I’d expect him to help out and I’d like to spend time with them but I just feel he’s either still a child in their eyes or a ‘companion’. 
I looked into enmeshment and I think some of it fits. He took that the wrong way and thought I was suggesting something dodgy was going on with his mum. I wasn’t suggesting that, but it all just seems weird to me 

I tried to figure out why this bothers me so much. I even wondered if I was just jealous of his attention and affection elsewhere but I don’t think it is. It technically doesn’t affect me and I’m an outsider looking in, I’m not experiencing it first hand. 
I think I just find the situation odd. ",2,1735302122.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.76,False

it’s happened and no one has come back to do a check on it since the last service request back in August or October I believe.

**Nuisance complaint**
I'm sure this is very minor but it has become a very pressing issue I live off Pimlico Pkwy and 3023 Pimlico Pkwy in Lexington has had noisy dogs for the past years I have been here I have been blamed for the loud dogs and at this point I feel it's the safest option to report this neighbor for a noise nuisance. I'm not looking to fine my neighbor by any means but this is downright out of control and I have tried everything from talking to my neighbor, befriending the dogs, using white noise, and blatantly ignoring it. I feel the best approach is to make it known this isn't ok behavior. I have lost alot of sleep as well as patience with this neighbor so I feel the best option is to address it via a warning. I want to remain anonymous in this situation if it is at all possible.

**Housing Complaint - Non Emergency**
I began my rental in October, but I did not move in until November. I paid everything in full. I have connected the lights, water and gas. I paid rental insurance and landlord insurance upon my moving in. I’ve been charged for a late payment which was already received to them, but then they added an extra tax to make it where I my payment was returned so therefore it was $75. I had to pay now within the month of November, my heat was not working. It took them two weeks to come and fix it to make it blow blow heat then the end of November 22 my stove went out. I did not have a stove up until December 23 then I was charged $40 on my monthly bill because I missed the appointment time to be here for them to come and check my stove, which I had already have information telling that lady that they could use the key to come in and maintenance the stove I don’t really believe that I’m supposed to be charged for missing the appointment when I when that when the landlord knows that I work every day eight hour shifts a day and they I’ve already listed on the maintenance service complaint that I was not gonna be home and they can get the key and come in Next within the same time they had to come back and fix my heat again because it stopped blowing heat and at this time I still do not have a stove. They didn’t bring me a stove for a whole month from November 22 to December 23. They brought the stove on the 23rd And I called the landlord and asked them for me to get a discount on my rent because it was inhabited for me not to have a stove for a whole month and breakages of my furnace heat not blowing heat when I have paid my gas bill and I have not heard back from themand I just want them to understand. We haven’t not having a stove having all the appliances working in the home is inhabited then within December, the knobs broke off in tub in the bathroom. They came immediately and fixed that but still I had no heat at that moment. The people downstairs had a sewage problem &mold
