Had an unplanned pregnancy and semi coerced termination by my then boyfriend...which led to a 4 year break from God.  I was in a very bad place mentally those years to the point of self harm.  A high school friend told me about a small non denominational church she was going to.  It was very family like, 200 people, everyone was young, nice music, I felt welcome.  I brought my boyfriend ( now husband) he had also started from his childhood church because of reasons.  He was raised pentacostle so this style of church felt normal to him. 
We get married, have three kids, his entire family starts going to this church also.  The church grows from 200 to thousands with not just a small building but now with multi site locations...6 to be exact.  We use to go every Sunday, the kids went to Sunday school I last  etc. but as things got bigger and bigger I felt more off.  Everything felt preformative.  So in the last 2 years I think we went to Church 3 times. Reason being was my now 3 teenagers think the worship music is too loud and don't like it.  Two kids joke that all they every learned that that they were opening new churches.  
About a month ago my daughter said "" I learned more about Christianity in school ( public) than I ever did at Church"" and it really hit me that I think I made a mistake raising these kids in a non denominational church.  So I had a semi religious midlife crisis and did as much research as Impossibly could and landed myself at an Episcopal Church 2 weeks ago.  My daughter is happy, she said she likes the structure so much better.  My youngest son does also,  My oldest son doesn't have an opinion.  My husband though feels like I'm trying to be Catholic without being Catholic which isn't the case.  There Are many reasons why I won't go back to the Catholic Church specifically my belief systems.  
He says he misses the music and the message from the pastor....2 things that made me so antsy.  Not sure if anyone else has been in a similar situation.  I wonder if he will see the beauty in the service and in communion and not need the 5 minutes of people singing the same chorus over and over and sharing father God with their eyes closed ( sorry I'm being a jerk). 
Last note, I feel like a big nerd because we leave right after the last 2 times but I know there is coffee hour.  It's so intimidating....I just had to put that out there lol.  ",1,1747073564.0,Episcopalian,0,1.0,False

I’ve been stuck in a cycle of confusion and emotional pain because of everything that happened between us.

We were dating, but she kept canceling plans last minute, accused me of not loving her, told me I’d get tired of her, and even pushed me to find someone else. When I tried to see her, she’d say her room was messy or come up with reasons to avoid me. Anytime I brought up my feelings, she’d threaten to leave, and she constantly mentioned others asking if she was single—almost like she wanted me to be jealous.

Eventually, she blocked me, only to send me an SMS saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her. Then she invited me to her mom’s birthday, later sent a message saying she loved me and missed me more than she expected. I refused to meet her, and she replied that I “abandoned” her and that it was “my choice.” She told me not to message her anymore so she wouldn't get false hope, and that I had taken her happiness away.

I started doubting myself deeply, even thinking about ending my own life. I don’t know if breaking up was the right thing—her actions were so contradictory, full of jealousy, emotional distance, and excuses. She once even encouraged me to download dating apps, only for me to find her on them after we broke up.

There were many red flags: avoiding introducing me to her family, never sharing her social media, withdrawing after I opened up, and getting angry over minor things. She said she had autism and insecurities, which might explain some of her behavior, but it didn’t make it easier.

One day she asked me to go to a party, then told me not to come. When I showed up earlier to spend time with her, she didn’t want me there—but her sister saw me waiting with chocolates and invited me in. That night, she introduced me as her boyfriend and then out of nowhere joked, “Let’s find a hot girl for you on a dating app.”

Our relationship was full of mixed signals. She’d ask me to leave, then cry when I did. After the breakup, she told me I sent her to a mental health clinic and ruined her. Then she said she missed me deeply. I gave it another shot, only to find her back on dating apps. She claimed she was using them to find someone for a friend.

Her mom even invited me over for coffee, but later she said her dad was mad at me. I vented online, and she saw it, saying I betrayed her and used her. Then she said it was all because she was insecure and autistic—and blocked me again.

Now I’m left wondering:

During those months she hurt me because she lied and kept things from me, she tried to talk to her ex a week into us chatting, and some other things like talk reminiscently about her time with him to our common friends, something I had to hear about through them while she and I were talking. But her father then passed away short after we connected, and she went through a tough period with grief and things, I didn't argue about those things that bothered me, because she had far more important issues, and in the span of a few months, she really changed for me, she became a much more mature, caring and loving person, someone who I've really grown to admire for her strength and everything. 

  
But those things kept bothering me because they weren't right, and she knew that, and had apologized, but I felt really disrespected, and maybe a part of me grew hateful or spiteful of her. Our time together was amazing, The distance is very much a problem for us as we have busy schedules and tickets are expensive, but now that I've realized how much I miss her, those things don't seem to matter anymore. But in February or March, we had a break-up, and shortly after I had got a coffee with a girl (lets call her jasmine). She is sweet and kind and very mature. But I had cut things off with her to try with  my ex again, but we just kept arguing and it failed. So shortly after I asked Jasmine out again, and since then we've been going out and as of a few weeks ago we're officially together. 

  
I am not romanticizing my ex when I say this but, I don't think I will ever feel for anyone like I did for her, she was magnetic, kind, sweet, and had really become someone for me. She had turned a lot around and I felt like I threw it away, Jasmine and I have been dating and it's been going generally well, but theres things we don't see eye to eye on, that really rub me the wrong way, she openly sexualises celebrities and she knows I see that, she isn't very affectionate or caring for me. It all feels dull and mundane, we cuddle and sleep together and spend time together but i feel in the essence of it all, we really dont know each other or will ever get to be as close as i was with my ex. 

  
The issue is I feel like i cheated on my ex, now that me and Jasmine started seeing each other, we had slept with each other and become physical. But i still lie away at night thinking about my ex, and knowing that no one will have my heart like her, but at the same time no one hurt me as much as she did, I am not attached to her in a toxic way, I just know it's different and I am afraid to message her, I dont know if it's a good idea. People say I should be single for now, but i feel bad hurting Jasmine like this, I feel like if the distance wasn't an issue, I would be with my ex without a doubt, we broke up because of the distance and that was really our only issue, but not im unsure of what to do.

How do I evaluate it, since we have been together from teenage years until now?","hey there! a few months ago i made a post on another subreddit about a situation that you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1j1dar9/aita_for_doing_something_my_boyfriend_said_i/) 

TL;DR of the post above: boyfriend (21M) was really shitty and borderline toxic to me (20F) and wouldn't take responsabilibity for the panic attacks that i had because of his behavior.

  
SO, a few days after that post, we fought and i said that a needed some time alone to think about our relationship, so he left me alone for a few days (even though he would mesage me sometimes, which i understood, but i was a bit annoyed). After 4-ish days without talking, we met up to try to talk things out. I even made a timeline of events, starting 2022, of events that i thought contributed to his anger issues (i wrote everything up in my notebook, i have a hard time in discussions, so much so that my mind goes completely blank and i cant say shit lol). he asked to speak first and i let him, and he was surprisingly genuine; he was actually apologising. he spent like, 2 hours just apologising for stuff. then i began to speak and told how i was feeling and the anxiety that he caused and how my chronic illness worsened bc of all the stress. then i brought up the possibility of break up because we have had talks like these 4 times before and i felt i was the only one changing. he asked me to reconsider and i said i was NOT hopeful but would try for some months, but to not keep his hopes up.

  
since then he has been lovely: he actually was listening to me, caring when i was in a depressive episode, talking to me about my interests and etc. but something is off.

  
see, i have a small doll collection, not much, but is something that brings me a lot of joy. they are super expensive tho, since im not in the US, so i usually wait for a sale or something. i commented once about this one doll i liked and, a month later, he bought me said doll FULL PRICE. i was shocked and thanked him, it was such a surprising episode for me. however, some time later, we went on a coffee date and we entered a library and he bought a comic book that ive been eyeing for a long time now. again, shocked, but now something in me wasnt all that happy anymore.

now he went full force and bought me a whole new pc, he even took on a LOAN to pay it. now im feeling bad, lovebombed and completely ofended. yes, the new computer is nice and i like it, dont get me wrong, but three expensive gifts in the span of 2 months? i feel like he is trying to win me over with gifts, but then again, he is being nice about it so i dont know if im being manipulated? and before anyone comments about it: no, i did not ask for anything and we are not rich, i work part-time because of college and he works 42 hours per week, earning a more than minimum wage by maybe 20 dollars

these last few days he has been more distant tho, so i don't know if he is doing that to make me feel bad. the thing is, even after all these gifts, promise to change, and being overall nicer, i don't know if i want this anymore. i did not want any of the gifts, he just bought them and gave them to me, i feel overwhelmed and guilty, because in theory i should be happy, but really i am not. but this is a 5 year old relationship, so i don't really know what to do anymore. i thought we knew each other really well, but now i don't really know anymore. im scared of upsetting him because of his reaction last time and i feel he is constantly stepping on eggshells to ""please me"" (and he constantly apologizes for things i really dont care about). i feel like im trapped, wanted an outsiders perspective

1kkzfeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1kkzfeu/my_father_was_a_brilliant_taxidermist_his_final/,My Father Was a Brilliant Taxidermist. His Final Project Was Not an Animal - Part 1,"I found out my father had died through a terse legal email from a firm I didn’t recognize. No condolences, no family contact. Just a subject line that read: “Notice of Deceased Estate Transfer - Urgent Response Required.” Attached were two PDFs: one listing my name and contact details as the next of kin, and another outlining the property I was set to inherit. A single address in rural Kentucky, a parcel of land just shy of sixty acres, and a two-story house that had last been appraised in the early 2000s. Beneath that was a line I reread three times before it fully registered: “Workshop (restricted access), outbuilding #1. Contents presumed hazardous; consult county code 43-B.”  
  
I hadn't spoken to my father in nearly fifteen years. We hadn’t fought exactly, just drifted, gradually and inevitably, until the silence between us became the only thing either of us seemed willing to maintain. Even when my mother died, he hadn’t called. The funeral passed without a word from him, and I’d learned long ago not to expect anything more. He had his work, and whatever that work became over time, it had consumed him.  
  
The drive into the hills brought it all back. That thick, dark stretch of Kentucky forest, the way the road narrowed the further you got from anything with a proper ZIP code. The GPS cut out an hour before I reached the property line. By then, the trees had thickened into walls on either side of the gravel road, and the shadows between them were so dense it looked more like dusk than early afternoon. I slowed the car almost unconsciously, listening to the crunch of tires on stone, aware that I hadn’t seen another vehicle for miles.  
  
The house stood at the edge of a clearing, tucked into the treeline as if even it knew not to intrude too far. It looked the way I remembered it- tall and tired, with flaking white paint and a porch that sagged in the middle. Ivy had begun its slow, deliberate crawl up one side, wrapping the windows with curling vines. A faded ""PRIVATE PROPERTY"" sign hung crookedly from a nail by the door, the lettering half-obscured by dirt and weather stains.  
  
Inside, the air smelled of dust. The furniture was all intact, though covered in white sheets, the way old houses tend to be in movies and not so often in real life. His taxidermy tools were still hanging in the hallway, lined up with almost surgical precision: bone saws, fine wire, curved needles. All clean. All in their place. The fireplace was filled with ash that looked recent, and a mug still sat by the chair in the study, ringed with the brown residue of long-evaporated coffee.  
  
I didn’t go into the workshop that first day. I walked out to the building, stared at the door, tested the handle, and found it locked. A heavy chain had been run through a bolted latch, the keyhole rusted but not broken. A single weathered tag hung from the handle, tied in place with red thread. Written in a steady hand, the words were simple: “Keep it shut.”  
  
It didn’t surprise me. My father had always treated that space as sacred. When I was a child, he would disappear into it for hours, sometimes days. I’d once asked him why he worked so late into the night, why he was always tinkering with bones and hides long after everyone else had gone to sleep. He had paused, needle in hand, and said something I never forgot.

When I was thirteen, he let me watch him mount a fox-hands steady, voice quiet, like a priest at a shrine. I remember the way he stitched the skin back together, humming low under his breath. When I asked why he spent so much time making dead things look alive again, he said it without looking up: “Preserving something is the only way to save it from the mountain.”  
  
“Preserving something is the only way to save it from the mountain.”  
  
At the time, I thought it was metaphor. A poeticism from a man who saw art in dead things. But there was no mistaking the gravity in his voice when he said it, nor the way he stared at the wall afterward, as if he were listening for something behind it.  
  
The town was a twenty-minute drive along winding roads, tucked low between the hills. A gas station, a grocery store, a diner. Not much else. When I walked into the grocery store, the woman at the counter looked up, did a double take, and then went completely still. Her expression smoothed out into politeness, but it wasn’t the kind born of courtesy. It felt practiced. Hesitant.  
  
“You’re Elijah’s boy,” she said after a moment, though I hadn’t given her a name.  
  
I nodded, unsure of the tone in her voice.  
  
She gave a faint smile, glanced toward the rear of the store, then quickly added, “Let me know if you need anything.”  
  
As I walked the aisles, I caught another customer pausing near the produce, eyes tracking me without subtlety. I noticed a man outside the window cross himself once before quickly turning away. It was a quiet reaction, almost instinctive, but it lingered in my head the rest of the day.  
  
I didn’t think much of it. I assumed it was the kind of tight-knit community awkwardness small towns specialized in. Outsiders were always observed, sometimes resented. I’d forgotten how strange it felt to be somewhere everyone remembered your last name.  
  
But it wasn’t hostility I felt in those glances, it was something else. Something closer to wariness. Or maybe reverence. And beneath it all, I could sense a strange question in the way they watched me, in the way they didn’t speak of my father at all.  
  
It wasn’t that they were unhappy to see me. It was that they didn’t know whether I was going to stay.

\-

The house creaked with age every time I stepped across the warped floorboards. Though it had been built to last, it hadn’t been lived in properly for years, and the weight of silence pressed against the walls harder than any storm ever could. There were signs that my father had lived here until the very end, an old kettle still resting on the stove, slippers placed neatly beside his worn recliner, but there was no warmth left in the rooms. Just residue.  
  
The mounts were the first things that started to unsettle me. He had always surrounded himself with his work, and the living room was no exception. Heads stared out from the walls: a red fox with matted fur, a hawk frozen in mid-screech, a dozen squirrels with arched backs and glassy, frozen tension in their limbs. A bobcat posed on the mantle, one paw extended, mouth drawn back in a snarl, but the expression didn’t read as predatory. It looked surprised. Almost embarrassed. Each of the eyes had that same strange quality I remembered from when I was young- too reflective, too focused, as if the gaze followed even when you turned your back.  
  
Some of the animals weren’t posed for realism at all. A possum on a corner shelf was sitting upright in a child’s chair, dressed in doll’s clothing, paws folded in its lap. A raccoon on the bookshelf had spectacles resting on its snout and a tiny copy of Walden glued into its paws. My father had done this kind of thing often, treated his taxidermy not just as preservation, but as storytelling. He used to joke that animals deserved to be remembered not for how they died, but for who they could have been. I hadn’t laughed the last time he said it. I wasn’t sure if it was meant to be comforting or a warning.  
  
The door to the backyard stuck in its frame, and it took a shoulder shove to get it open. Outside, the grass was knee-high, wild and overgrown, thick with seed heads. Beyond the rusting garden gate stood the workshop. It was taller than I remembered, with a pitched roof and windowless walls wrapped in thick ivy. Every nail, every board, seemed carefully placed. It had the look of something that had been built slowly, with enormous patience, and no intention of ever being abandoned.  
  
The lock on the door was old brass, darkened from years of weather. I had already found the chain earlier, looped tight and secured with a keyed padlock. My father had always guarded his workspace. But now, looking at it again with the woods at my back and the breeze filtering in through the trees, it felt more like a warning than a barrier.  
  
I didn’t find the key until that evening, when I was thumbing through the shelves in his study. Most of the books were what you’d expect: anatomy manuals, wildlife field guides, a few volumes on mortuary science. But wedged between two copies of a leather-bound family Bible was a much older edition, heavy and dry with age. I opened it on instinct and found a hollow carved out of the middle. Nestled inside was a single iron key wrapped in cloth. On the opposite page, the entire section of Leviticus had been torn out. Not cut, not carefully removed, ripped by hand, as if in anger or urgency.  
  
I didn’t wait until morning. The key fit the padlock perfectly, and the chain fell away. The door opened easier than the one in the kitchen had, revealing a darkness that smelled of cedarwood, dust, and the faintest trace of chemical sweetness. I reached for the light and found a pull cord, which snapped down with a metallic click. Fluorescent lights buzzed to life overhead, flickering once before settling.  
  
The space was much larger than I remembered. The walls were lined with shelves of labeled jars and plastic storage tubs. At the far end stood an industrial-grade workbench with a leather stool beside it, tools arranged above with obsessive precision. There were bones on the shelves. Tiny skulls. Preserved eyes. Threads, needles, bottles of tanning solution, wires, foam molds. His entire world, kept in perfect order.  
  
But what caught my attention were the covered forms.  
  
Eight of them in total, each resting on low display tables. They were shrouded in beige drop cloths, still and silent, but I could see the suggestion of limbs beneath the fabric. Arms folded across chests. Legs slightly bent. The outlines of heads that seemed too round, too soft.  
  
I pulled the cover off the nearest one.  
  
Beneath it was a figure. Human-shaped. About the size of an adolescent child, though thinner, with elongated limbs and a narrow waist. The skin was stitched tight over the form, pale and patchworked, with subtle shifts in color and texture that told me it had not come from one source. The hands were too small. The feet too broad. But what freaked me out was what it looked to be made of.

Animal parts, cobbled together to make the amalgamation of shapes. The torso was seamless, but the shoulders looked animal in origin, slightly hunched, ridged beneath the surface. The face was calm. Serene, even. Eyes open, mouth parted just enough to suggest breath.

It was an abomination. A sick imitation of human life.  
  
The eyes were glass, of course. But they weren’t the mass-produced kind you ordered from a taxidermy supplier. They looked custom, too real. I couldn’t explain it beyond a gut reaction. I’d seen hundreds of mounted animals in my life, even helped preserve a few.  
  
I stared at it longer than I meant to, trying to make sense of the proportions, the materials, the reason. I told myself it had to be some artistic experiment. A commission, maybe. Something for a gallery or a private collector with odd tastes. My father had always flirted with art as much as science.  
  
Still, I dropped the cloth back over the figure before leaving the workshop, and when I turned off the light, I could have sworn one of the others had shifted slightly in the dark.

\-

I found her at the bar on the edge of town, the one with a rusted jukebox and a pool table that hadn’t seen a straight cue in twenty years. It was early afternoon, and the place was empty except for a few old men nursing long-warmed beer and the woman behind the counter. She looked up when I walked in, eyes narrowing briefly before recognition softened her expression.  
  
“You’re Elijah’s boy,” she said, wiping her hands on a towel. “Didn’t think you’d ever show.”  
  
“I wasn’t planning to,” I replied. “But here I am.”  
  
She gestured to a stool and poured me something amber without asking. I took it. Her name was Ruth. I remembered her now, in pieces. She’d been older than me when we were kids, maybe eight or nine years older, and had worked in this bar even back then. She still wore her dark hair tied up, and there was a silver ring in her nose that looked recent. Her eyes held a mixture of curiosity and caution.  
  
We talked about nothing for a while. Weather, power outages, a storm that had rolled through the valley a week before. She asked about the house, and I told her it was just as I remembered. We didn’t talk about my father. Not at first. It hung between us though, thick and obvious.  
  
Eventually, after her second cigarette and my third drink, I asked the question I’d been holding in since I arrived.  
  
“What was my father really doing up there?”  
  
She exhaled slowly, eyes flicking to the window. The wind pushed a curtain of dust across the empty parking lot, then passed. She didn’t answer at first, just pulled out another cigarette and lit it with a match that she struck against the bar’s metal edge.  
  
“You ever hear about the missing children?” she asked.  
  
I shook my head.  
  
“They don’t talk about it anymore. Not officially. But people remember.” She looked past me now, her voice steady but low. “Used to be, every couple decades, a kid would vanish. No struggle. No noise. Just gone. Folks blamed the woods. Wild animals. Running away. But they never found bodies. Not one. Just toys left in fields. Shoes by riverbanks.”  
  
I listened, feeling the chill settle into my spine.  
  
“Then your great-grandfather showed up,” she continued. “Stranger, back then. Didn’t belong here. But he built the house, set up a shop. Started doing odd jobs for the town. Kept to himself, mostly. Then, around the time he finished that workshop of his, the disappearances stopped.”  
  
“What does that have to do with me?” I asked, though the answer was starting to form.  
  
“Your family’s never really been... part of us. Not in the normal way. But when things got quiet, people let it be. No more missing kids. No more mothers waking up to empty cribs. And the ones who remembered just told their children, and their children’s children, to stay away from the ridge.”  
  
I frowned. “The ridge?”  
  
Ruth stubbed out her cigarette and finally looked at me.  
  
“You never went up there as a kid, did you?”  
  
“No,” I said slowly. “My father wouldn’t let me.”  
  
That much was true. I remembered the day I’d asked about it. I was ten. It had been the end of summer, the air sticky and still, and I’d wandered too far past the treeline behind the house. When I got back, my father had been waiting. Not shouting. Not even angry in the usual way. But the way his face had looked, white, hollow, terrified, that stuck with me more than any punishment ever could.  
  
He’d grabbed my arm, pulled me into the workshop, and told me never to go beyond the ridge again. Not alone. Not at dusk. His voice had cracked when he said it.  
  
“It can smell grief,” he’d whispered, like it was a fact of nature. “That’s what it waits for.”  
  
At the time, I’d thought he was talking about a bear or maybe something more metaphorical. A lesson in coping with loss, or how sadness leaves you vulnerable. But now I wasn’t so sure.  
  
Ruth poured another drink and leaned on the bar.  
  
“Your grandfather took over after your great-grandfather died. Then your father after him. That house isn’t just a house. That workshop isn’t just a studio. They were preservers. That’s what they were called, though not out loud. You were either born into it or you weren’t, and your family always was.”  
  
“Preservers of what?” I asked.  
  
She didn’t answer at first. Just shook her head.  
  
“Whatever’s out there,” she said finally. “Whatever your family was holding at bay.”  
  
I laughed, but it came out thin and strained.  
  
“You really believe that?”  
  
“I don’t need to believe,” she said. “I just remember what happened the one time there wasn’t a preserver. Your father left for three years after your mother passed. Do you remember that?”  
  
I shook my head, but asked her to continue.  
  
“There were two kids taken in that gap. And when your father came back, when he reopened the workshop and started working again, they stopped.”  
  
I didn’t know what to say to that. Didn’t know how to process it. It sounded absurd. But then again, so did the figure in the workshop. The child. The seams. The glass eyes.  
  
“People won’t say it out loud,” she continued. “But they’re watching you, because you’re Elijah’s son.”  
  
I drained the rest of the drink and sat in silence, the taste lingering on my tongue like ash.

\-

By the third day, I had started making a checklist. There were utility companies to call, property records to transfer, and a dozen minor errands I hadn’t anticipated. The sooner everything was handled, the sooner I could get the house listed and gone. That was the plan. No need to stay longer than necessary.  
  
I returned to town with a folder of documents tucked under one arm and a list of questions in my phone, hoping for a few straightforward conversations. What I found instead was more of that quiet, sidelong energy I couldn’t quite pin down. It was in the way people greeted me with soft smiles that didn’t reach their eyes, or the way conversations seemed to pause when I stepped too close.  
  
At the county clerk’s office, I asked about transferring the property. The woman behind the desk was pleasant, but vague.  
  
“There’s a few steps,” she said, flipping through a binder that looked older than she was. “You’ll need to file locally. Probably have to wait on county sign-off.”  
  
“How long does that usually take?”  
  
She blinked. “Depends.”  
  
“On what?”  
  
She offered another smile and glanced toward the hallway behind her. “Lots of things. But we’ll do our best to help. Don’t you worry.”  
  
It wasn’t a refusal, but it wasn’t a straight answer either. The whole conversation felt padded with something too soft to push through.  
  
At the utility office, I tried to disconnect water and electricity. The man behind the glass told me the system was ""in a backlog."" When I pressed for details, he shrugged and said I might be better off waiting a bit before I filed.  
  
The grocery store was no better. The same woman from earlier still remembered my name, and she asked about the house again, but there was a cautious distance behind her tone. She offered me a discount at the register I hadn’t asked for. The man behind me muttered something I didn’t catch, and she gave him a quick glare. No one spoke after that.  
  
I drove back to the house with the windows down, trying to shake off the feeling. Maybe it was just rural bureaucracy. Maybe small towns really were this awkward around outsiders, and I had forgotten what it was like to be watched for nothing more than showing up.  
  
Still, the sense of being surrounded by people who were waiting for something I hadn’t agreed to kept crawling back in. I didn’t know what they expected. I wasn’t staying. I had a job, a life, a home far from here. All I wanted was to get things in order and move on.  
  
That evening, as I sat on the porch nursing a warm beer, a man pulled into the drive. He stepped out of an old pickup, moved slow and deliberate, with the kind of confidence that comes from being part of a place for too long to question it.  
  
He introduced himself as Vernon Mott. Said he was part of the local historical society, though the way he said it gave the impression that his title was more about tradition than any real bureaucracy. His shirt was clean, tucked into faded jeans, and he wore a black belt with a silver buckle that had worn smooth from decades of use. He had the kind of face that looked older than it probably was, all deep lines and windburn.  
  
We talked politely for a few minutes. He asked how I was settling in, whether I needed anything. I told him I appreciated the help, but what I really needed was information- namely, how to speed up the paperwork. How to get the utilities handled. Why everyone seemed to stall when I mentioned selling the place.  
  
His mouth twitched. Not a smile, not quite. More of a sigh escaping his lips.  
  
“I can’t speak for everyone,” he said. “They mean well. It’s just not easy.”  
  
“Not easy to what?” I asked. “Let go of the house? Deal with outsiders?”  
  
He looked down at his boots, then back up at me.  
  
“They’re not afraid of you,” he said. “They’re afraid you won’t stay.”  
  
I didn’t answer. Not right away. His words hit with more weight than I expected.  
  
This wasn’t suspicion. This was something closer to resignation. A town bracing for something they feared might happen again.  
  
“I’m not planning to stay,” I admitted. “I never was.”  
  
“I figured,” he said. “You’ve got that look. Same one your father had when he left the first time.”  
  
I stared at him.  
  
“I’m not judging,” he added. “But I know what happens when the house goes empty. I’ve seen it.”  
  
He paused, then glanced toward the tree line beyond the yard. His tone changed.  
  
“I won’t ask you to believe anything. Not yet. But I’ll ask you this, come meet me at the ridge. Past the treeline. Just after sunset.”  
  
“For what?” I asked.  
  
He didn’t answer right away. Just stepped backward toward his truck.  
  
“To understand,” he said finally. “Nothing more.”  
  
Then he left. No goodbye. No pressure. Just the sound of his tires grinding down the gravel road until they disappeared into the dark.

\-

The sun had already begun to dip when I found Vernon waiting just beyond the split-rail fence at the edge of the property. He didn’t speak as I approached, just gave a shallow nod and turned toward the woods. I followed without a word, the only sound between us the crunch of dried leaves underfoot and the rasp of wind filtering through the canopy.  
  
The trees thickened quickly, pressing in from both sides. Paths weren’t marked out here. Whatever trail we followed was made through memory alone, worn by years of footfalls rather than signs or blazes. Brambles reached toward us, snagging at our sleeves. A low fog coiled near the roots, carrying the damp scent of moss and iron.  
  
After fifteen minutes of walking in silence, Vernon raised one hand to halt me. His voice was quiet but heavy.  
  
“From here on, you must not speak. Not even to breathe too loud. If it hears us, it may not understand.”  
  
I nodded once, not trusting myself to ask what he meant.  
  
We moved slower after that, picking our way through thickets of ferns and roots slick with decay. The light dimmed rapidly, and the woods grew still. No birds. No insects. Just the sound of our own breath and the occasional crack of twigs underfoot.  
  
Eventually, the forest opened into a clearing.  
  
It was not shaped naturally. The trees along its edge had bowed inward, their branches reaching toward each other overhead like the ribs of a collapsed lung. At the center of the clearing sat something I had no words for.  
  
At first, I thought it was part of the forest. A massive shape hunched low, covered in layers of bark and moss. But then it shifted, and I saw the seams. The movement was slow, almost graceful, and entirely wrong.  
  
It was enormous, crouched in the clearing like a thing too large for the world around it. Its body was a patchwork of flesh and hide, stitched together by time and instinct. Some parts moved with the weight of muscle beneath skin, while others creaked like dry branches being bent too far. The shape of it was loosely human in structure, but warped by growth and time and some fundamental misunderstanding of form. Its shoulders were broad, sloping downward into arms that ended in elongated hands, each finger tipped with a different claw or hoof. Tufts of hair sprouted along its back. A jaw protruded from beneath one shoulder, mismatched and slack.  
  
But it was the way it held the thing in its arms that froze me in place.  
  
It was cradling something. A figure roughly the size of a child, though lumpy and slumped in strange ways, as if its limbs had softened or rotted inward. The skin was pale and patchy, its arms wrapped tight around its midsection. I could see stitches unraveling across its neck, the head lolling at an angle that suggested it might not be fully attached anymore.  
  
The creature stroked the figure gently, its oversized fingers adjusting an arm, tucking a loose flap of skin back into place. It rocked the child slowly, rhythmically, with the soft urgency of something that did not understand time but felt it slipping away.  
  
I could not move. Could not look away.  
  
The thing it held reminded me too much of what I had found in the workshop. The same glassy stillness, the same too-long limbs and sagging expression. But this one was older. Broken down. Handled too much. It looked like it had been played with for far too long.  
  
Vernon leaned in close, barely breathing, and whispered into the edge of my ear.  
  
“We call it The Parent. It sits here and plays with its Child. And It’s almost done with that one.”  
  
I turned my head slightly, eyes still locked on the clearing.  
  
“What happens when it finishes?” I mouthed.  
  
He didn’t answer. But I saw his throat tighten, his jaw shift. The kind of look people give when they are thinking of graves.  
  
Then the Parent paused. Its fingers stopped moving. The head turned just a little, and though its face was a tangle of parts I couldn’t quite interpret, I knew it was listening. One massive arm lifted, held there mid-air, suspended with uncanny stillness.  
  
Vernon did not move.  
  
Neither did I.  
  
Something passed between the trees behind us. A breeze or a shadow, I could not say. But the Parent shifted again, settling its attention back onto the thing in its arms. It resumed its motion, rocking once more.  
  
Vernon tapped my wrist and began to back away, one step at a time. I mirrored him, keeping my eyes low, careful not to snap a single twig.  
  
It took us nearly twenty minutes to reach the edge of the woods again. Only once we were back in the open air of the field did he speak.  
  
“It doesn’t find children anymore,” he said. His voice was rough, almost hoarse. “Not when it has one. Not when the illusion holds.”  
  
I didn’t say anything.  
  
“But when the body breaks down, when the seams go soft or the smell fades, it starts to wander. And it doesn’t know what it’s looking for, only that something is missing.”  
  
We stood in silence, the stars beginning to emerge overhead.  
  
“The things your father made were built to last,” he said. “Humans don't. Once it starts, it won't stop.”  
  
I looked back toward the woods, the trees still and dark.  
  
“And you think that thing I found in the workshop…”  
  
“It was the last one your father made. He must’ve known it was wearing down. That’s why he was working on another.”  
  
I nodded, though I felt nothing in that moment but the slow, rising pulse of dread.  
  
“It’s waiting,” Vernon said. “And if it finishes with that one before another is ready, it will start to search again. Same as it always has.”  
  
He left me standing in the field, saying nothing more.  
  
I watched him go, then looked back at the tree line once more, wondering how much time we had left.

I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling long after the darkness had settled over the house. The blankets were pulled tight around me, but there was no warmth. My mind circled endlessly around what I had seen in the clearing, the way the creature had cradled that broken thing in its arms, the tenderness of its movements, the way its massive body had tensed when it heard us.  
  
The Parent.  
  
That was what Vernon had called it, though the word didn’t feel sufficient. Parents are human. They protect, they nurture, they know when to let go. This thing did none of those things. It only held on.  
  
I turned onto my side and tried to breathe deeply, but every breath caught in my throat. My father had lived with that knowledge. He had known what was out there and chose to stay. He made those things with his own hands, again and again, to keep the creature from wandering. He built them as decoys or offerings, or something stranger I still didn’t understand. And now it had been months, maybe longer, since the last one had begun to unravel.  
  
It would come again. That much was clear.  
  
But not for me.  
  
I wasn’t my father. I hadn’t asked for this, and I hadn’t agreed to carry it. I had come here to settle an estate, not inherit a burden that pressed against the edge of reason. There was still time. I could sell the property, leave the workshop locked, and be gone before it ever came too close.  
  
I told myself this again and again until it stopped sounding like cowardice.  
  
The next morning, I drove back into town and made a show of visiting the grocery store and post office. I stopped by the county clerk’s office with a fake smile and asked about the remaining paperwork. I spoke carefully, hinting that I was still thinking things over, that I might not leave right away after all. The clerk, an older woman with tired eyes, nodded along with me. But when I asked about the property transfer again, she sighed and flipped through her ledger with exaggerated patience.  
  
“Still waiting on a couple signatures,” she said. “You know how it is. Takes time.”  
  
I nodded, pretending not to see the way she avoided meeting my gaze. It was a stall tactic. The same kind I had seen in all the others. They weren’t blocking me outright. They were just hoping I’d change my mind.  
  
Fine, I thought. I could play the same game.  
  
I pretended to explore the idea of staying. I asked questions at the diner. I chatted with Vernon when I saw him outside the library. I kept my tone neutral, polite, even curious. I wanted to believe I was fooling them. But part of me suspected they saw through it. They had watched my father play this role his whole life. They would know the difference between someone preparing to stay and someone buying time to run.  
  
Still, I gave myself a deadline. Three more days. By then, the form should clear, and I could list the property officially. I would pack my things, drop off the keys, and drive back to a life that, while unremarkable, was blissfully mundane.  
  
Two mornings later, I heard shouting before I even left the house.  
  
It echoed from the road, where a group had gathered near the general store. I walked down, heart already sinking, and pushed through the loose crowd of neighbors and passersby. Vernon was there, standing beside a woman I didn’t recognize. She was trembling, holding a child’s shoe in both hands.  
  
Her face was hollow. Blank. Her lips moved, but no sound came. Vernon rubbed her shoulder, speaking gently, trying to steady her. The sheriff stood nearby, his expression unreadable. He held a radio but didn’t seem to be using it.  
  
The townsfolk watched me as I approached. No one said my name. No one called me over. But I could feel the weight of their eyes.  
  
I looked down at the woman and realized she was mouthing the same phrase over and over again.  
  
“He was just in the yard.”  
  
My stomach twisted. I didn’t need to ask what had happened. The absence was already there, sharp and undeniable.  
  
A child was gone.  
  
My first instinct was to turn away, to leave before someone tried to explain it. But I didn’t. I stepped closer. Vernon met my gaze, and in his eyes I saw something worse than judgment. I saw relief—thin and brittle, but real.  
  
They had expected this. Maybe not this week, maybe not this child. But the moment I arrived and did nothing, they must have known it would come again.  
  
Later, when the search party formed and scattered into the woods, I sat with the mother on the store’s porch. I brought her a cup of water she didn’t drink. She never looked at me directly, but I heard her whisper to no one in particular.  
  
“They said it wouldn’t come back. They said he kept it away.”  
  
I left her there, the weight of her voice pressing into my chest with each step.

My husband and I are at odds on parenting choices that we are making and the level of precaution each of us takes. We had a blowup about this situation today because I’ve told him our child’s safety is a hill I will die on and it seems like he isn’t taking this seriously. I feel like I’m not taking this seriously enough. He and I agreed I should make a post and we have both approved the details here before I posted. I’ve changed some unimportant details to be more anonymous.

I (35f) and he (41m) have one child (3m) together. We have been trying for a second. I don’t work in child care now but I did for a long time and had all the safety certifications. He doesn’t have a background with kids but he loves our son and, while we have disagreements about our parenting approaches, he clearly wants to be a good dad. I have a gentle parenting approach and he mostly tries to align with it since he’s not very intentional about parenting in general—that has caused problems but it’s not the main issue here. He did get diagnosed as being neurodivergent a while back at my urging to get tested and, while I’ve encouraged him to be more proactive about strategies for managing it, he hasn’t done much—I think that could be part of what is happening here with his inattention and avoidance of the safety issues. 

Back story, not the first safety issue but the most serious: a few weeks ago, he was outside with our son on a day without daycare and work for them. I still had work but I WFH and was upstairs. We have a long driveway and are on a somewhat busy road in our town. It’s not too busy but cars can be fast and there are some plants near the end of the driveway that can limit visibility. I looked out the window of my home office upstairs that overlooks the driveway and saw our son right at the end of the driveway near the street. He was playing with a broomstick and stepping slightly into the road. I banged on my window and he didn’t notice, so I opened it and started banging and screaming through the screen. I got our son’s attention—and a car approached during this time but slowed down—and screamed at him to go back toward the house. He did and I ran outside through the front door in my pajamas still screaming. I picked my son up and ran with him in the house through the garage, and my husband noticed as I did that. He had been cleaning my car with a shopvac and didn’t have any idea what was happening. My son was screaming and crying because I was crying, and normally I’m very calm and measured with him. My husband came in and started to scold my son: apparently he had told him not to go beyond the broom that he had put in the middle of the driveway. The smart little guy had found the technicality in that and moved the broom all the way to the end of the road. I stopped him, settled my son down and gave him lunch, then got him down for his nap. I was furious. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced in my life, knowing how helpless I was up at that window as he wandered into the gutter with nobody watching him and me not being able to get to him while a car approached. It meant my husband likely hadn't paid any attention to him in 1-2 minutes to not notice that happening. We had plans that night and I wanted to cancel them but tried to rally. My husband told the story at dinner with people like it was a funny thing and not traumatic for me and embarrassing for him.

Now, what happened yesterday: I slept in for Mother’s Day and stayed in bed later than usual because he had mentioned our son wanted to make me breakfast. I texted when I had been up for a while to let him know I was awake. He said he was out getting supplies and my son had slowed things down. At the time I thought that meant he was just slow getting our son out the door. They came up, brought me flowers and coffee and all was well. My husband said he was going downstairs to make pancakes and our son wanted to go to “help.” During pancakes, he mentioned something that stopped me in my tracks: I realized he had left our son downstairs watching TV while I was asleep upstairs. We have a large house and I sleep with a sound machine. I had no idea at all that my son had been completely unattended downstairs for at least a half hour while my husband ran an errand. If he had choked, lit the gas, been cut, fallen from something, wandered outside….I would have had no idea. Even if I had heard something downstairs, I would have barely heard it and assumed my husband was awake and dealing with it since he wasn’t in bed and I knew he planned to get up with him for Mother's Day prep. I put on a brave face during breakfast and pulled him aside to say I didn’t want to start a fight but that really freaked me out. He said he now realizes he shouldn't have done that but he thought it was fine because he told him to come upstairs and get me if he needed me. I left it alone for the rest of the day and tried to have fun on Mother’s Day but it was bothering me and making me sad and anxious all day. 

We both WFH so today around lunchtime I went to speak to him about this. I said it’s making me concerned and that I’ll always have to look out for our son and put him first, even if it means telling my husband he is wrong about this. I’m worried about not being able to trust that our son will be safe with him, and what this will do to our relationship especially because we want another child which means I will naturally have to trust him solo with the kids more. He blew it off as a difference of opinion and us having different ways of doing things. At a certain point I lost it and said if he can’t see it from my perspective, he needs to consider how this would look explaining his choices to the police or social services. I said this was child neglect and abandonment. 

Am I overreacting? I feel like I am underreacting and giving him too much credit for repeatedly endangering our child. He obviously thinks I’m overreacting. He isn’t expressing a plan for trying to manage this behavior and get on the same page for the sake of our son’s safety. His additional comment: “Where I get hung up on this whole thing is I truly don’t see the difference between him being able to leave the room at night now while we’re sleeping and what happened.""",2,1747072798.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

1991 WordsIf you have not met Charlotte and her Triad previously  
  
The Characters – Or 'What Went Before'  
  
Charlotte:  
  
Originally known as 'Jennifer Conners' (Jenny) when she was a child. Charlotte had a grim upbringing. Imprisoned in a 'Children's Home' known as 'Blessingmoors', actually an outlet for human trafficking, she never knew her mother and father, and was destined for a life as s\*x-slave.  
  
To escape that life, Charlotte decided to go to university to give herself the education to make it in the world. To raise the funds to do so, she chose to auction herself and her virginity to the highest bidder.  
  
James and Michael:  
  
Charlotte's 'Buyer' was James, long-term Dom, architect-engineer, divorced and stinging from his first marriage. During a madcap week of wild s\*\*\*\*l adventure (See 'Mastering the Virgin' – Box Set One -  FREE Download), James introduced Charlotte to the pleasures of b\*\*m and ménage with his old friend Michael, who 'loves women'. Blond, and unusually handsome, Michael lived the life of the 'Bachelor Free' for many years until he met Charlotte.  
  
Over time, James became Charlotte's Master. Michael became, first her 'Golden Lover', then her fiancée, and finally her husband. The three formed a Triad, now travelling through life in a three-cornered marriage.  
  
Charlotte is now pregnant by James.  
  
Mitch:  
  
Michelle Kimberley - Charlotte/Jenny's mother. Driven to escape from a suffocating childhood, Mitch ran away from home at the age of fifteen. She survived by becoming a high-class courtesan, eventually becoming involved with:  
  
Klempner:  
  
Lawrence (Larry) Klemper: ex-mercenary and human trafficker. During an affair with Mitch, before understanding the kind of man he was, she became pregnant by him. Realising too late that she was involved with a dangerous criminal, she ran, eventually marrying Klempner's friend, Frank Conners, and passing Jennifer off as his child.  
  
Klempner swore revenge, pursuing the couple. When Jennifer was two years old, Klempner captured her, imprisoning her in Blessingmoors. Mitch, believing her daughter was dead, went into hiding for over twenty years.  
  
After events in which many truths were revealed, Klempner came to understand that he had not been betrayed and gave up his revenge. Regretting his past actions, he agreed to walk out of Mitch's life and to allow her to find happiness on her own terms.   
  
Richard and Beth:  
  
Richard Haswell, billionaire property developer and Dom, owner of a significant proportion of 'The City' and first, James' employer then his co-director.  
  
Elizabeth: his wife and sub and related by blood to Charlotte.  
  
Over time, the couple have become close friends with the Triad, and now are part of a developing polyamorous marriage. Richard and James share their pleasures with Charlotte. Michael is Beth's 'second husband'.  
  
Now read on...  
  
Michael - Eleven Weeks  
  
I lie awake, an arm propped behind my head. Lying beside me; Charlotte, eyes closed, her breathing steady and slow. Beyond her, James, the rise and fall of his chest equally regular.   
  
Richard and Beth are in the next room. Perhaps they're sleeping. I'm not sure. It seems to me I sometimes hear a low murmur of words.  
  
But, my mind a-whirl, sleep escapes me.  
  
Should I get up?  
  
Make a coffee? Read perhaps...  
  
But right now, I don't want to leave the bed or my sleeping wife. For her perhaps to wake and find me not here.  
  
So, tossing and turning, I while away the darkness, watching slanted moonbeams make their slow progression across the carpet, then the bed, before finally fading. And now the first grey light of dawn creeps across the windows.  
  
A blackbird chirrups its early arpeggio; a sweet melodic prelude to the full chorus that will follow.  
  
And still my mind wheels and turns.  
  
The sheer enormity of what Richard has offered me takes my breath away.Chapter 1: Target, Part 1",1,1747072303.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Paityn (Pay-tin) Mary Thompson's POV:  
  
""Paityn!""  My boss, Catherine Johns, yelled from her office.  
  
""Coming!""  I called and quickly jumped up from my desk that was right outside of her door.  
  
Catherine is the head of this department of Binder and John's Attorneys at Law.  Yes, her husband is one of the owners of this law firm.  They have more than one location.  This location is in Manhattan and is the one that she runs while her husband and Mr. Binder are at another in New Jersey.  Now, Catherine isn't an attorney, she just makes sure all the paralegals at this location do what they need to do, whatever she thinks that is.  
  
Mr. Johns needed to go to the location in New Jersey because they were expanding and hiring several more attorneys to help and just sent all the paralegals over here for Catherine.  She's not really anything either, just passes the orders from her husband or Mr. Binder to everyone else.  She just got the job because she's Mr. Johns' wife and she begged for it, more like bribed.  We all know about it too because we could hear those two going at it in his office when he was still here.    
  
At that time I was his legal secretary but when she took over this location, I became hers.  I don't do half the stuff for her that I did for him.  I'm not a paralegal or anything, I just make the deliveries to the courthouses or to the other attorney location in New Jersey along with a lot of work with legal documents.  I answer the calls that are sent to her but she didn't want to answer them anymore so now I do instead and either continue the call to her, or I send them straight to her voicemail.   
  
She's lazy as hell too.  I have to get her coffee, lunch, and anything else she wishes.  I have to file her files for her, get more files, make up the case packets and get everything around to get to the lawyer that is on the case.  I never had to do the little things like getting coffee or lunch for her husband.  I actually did more legal secretarial work.  Now I feel I'm just at her beck and call and it drives me nuts!  This is not what the thousands of dollars paid for in college.  
  
My husband, Isaiah Michael Thompson keeps telling me that I need to just quit.  We fight about this all of the time.  Since we got married he has wanted me to stay home.  At the time we were barely making ends meet and I loved my job.  That was before Catherine took over.  Now she and I just butt heads all the time and she is always having me do useless work and sometimes I don't get out of the office until late at night.    
  
He just told me last night that we make enough now that I don't have to keep working for her and to just quit but I just can't.  I don't know why but I don't want to quit my job.  I guess I keep hoping that maybe they will open up another branch and I can either work over there and away from her or she can go to the new branch because I highly doubt she will ever quit or get fired.    
  
I quickly finished writing the last thing I needed down on a sticky note quick so I wouldn't forget and got up from my desk and walked into her office.  It's not like I'm that far from her.  I'm just right outside her door but she would rather scream at me from in her office than pick up the phone and call me or walk a few feet from her desk to get me.  
  
""You need to hurry and get these files to Mr. Johns at the courthouse in New Jersey right away!  The time for court just got changed to one this afternoon and they need the updated files.  A new witness has been added for questioning and they are getting called to the stand today!""  She said quickly and held the files over her desk towards me.  
  
""Yes, ma'am,""  I told her.  
  
She feels that she is too important now that she runs this office to be called Mrs. Johns or Catherine so we are required to call her ma'am.  I don't think anyone here cares to call her that but they don't really say much because they aren't the ones that get stuck listening to her all of the time as I do.  I'd rather call her b\*\*\*h but I think that would get me fired and I would rather not.  If I lost this job that means Isaiah wins in the running argument we have had for the last four years of marriage.  
  
I grabbed the several files that she had in her hand and I walked quickly out of her office and back to my desk.  I grabbed my purse and put my phone back in it and put the strap over my shoulder and headed out of the office building.  I walked quickly to the elevators and pushed the button to go down.  I looked up and saw it going from one floor to the next and then stopping.  It was picking more up on its way down!  
  
I looked down at my watch to see how much time I had to get to the other office and it said 11:30.   
  
""Shit.""  I hissed to myself.  
  
Why does she do this all of the time!  That's barely enough time to get to that other office let alone for them to go over the files for the new witness!  
  
Just then the elevator dinged, letting me know that it finally got to the tenth floor that I was on and could finally head down.  Once the doors opened, a flood of people walked out, practically knocking me over.  It's not like they couldn't see me or anything.  I'm 5'8 and I'm standing in two-inch heals right now.  They just have attitude, I think, when they are coming back from lunch.  I mean I wouldn't want to come back and deal with Catherine either.Chapter 1",1,1747072292.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1kkz1of,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1kkz1of/anyone_start_small_and_organically_grow_a_small/,Anyone start small and organically grow a small roasting business?,"Title. I have recently started roasting my own beans with a Fresh SR800 with expansion chamber. I think I'm pretty good at it. I've had good results so far, and I've roasted for friends and family who are all impressed with the coffee. I'm considering starting a small business operation and doing it alongside my full-time job. 

My question is: does anyone else do this? Is it viable to make any money? If so, where are you getting green beans from? So far I've been getting things in 5lb batches from Coffee Bean Corral, but the margin is pretty slim when its $8-10 a pound + shipping. Is it foolish to do this with the equipment I currently have?

1kkz12t,https://www.reddit.com/r/chapelhill/comments/1kkz12t/visit_this_local_business_annual_shareholder/,Visit this local business annual shareholder meeting May 21st!,"Hello, fellow residents of Chapel Hill.

Some of you may have noticed a local business on the intersection of Rosemary and Columbia called Investors Title Company.  If you hangout in downtown Chapel Hill, you've almost certainly walked by it.

They happen to trade on the NASDAQ as ITIC and are very successful.  Started in the 1970s, the founders (the Fine family) still run it.  They sell title insurance.  Like any company with a stock, they have an annual shareholder meeting, but they don't do theirs in a big city.  They do it here in Chapel Hill!

2025's annual shareholder meeting is next Wednesday, May 21st, at 11:00 AM in the Siena Hotel on E Franklin St.  I had the pleasure of going last year and meeting the folks.  They are a friendly, fairly casual group of people that profitably run an ""ain't broke, don't fix it"" kind of business.

Anyway, I am sharing in case anyone would like to attend.  Last year I became a shareholder myself, and I wouldn't mind meeting other shareholders.  If you're not one, it could be a good chance to learn something and network with other locals, which is the main reason I am sharing it here.  Pretty sure there will be free coffee.

If you do come, my name's Joe.  I'll be wearing all black, with blond hair & blue eyes.  The meeting room is just to the left when you enter the Siena.

Edit: Should add, I expect it will be about 90 minutes, two hours tops.",2,1747072225.0,chapelhill,0,1.0,False
1kkz0wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/1kkz0wf/please_help/,Please help,"I recently stopped at the Samish Starbucks with my dog, thimble. Whenever me and thimble get coffee I HAVE to get him a pup cup (It’s a part of my daily coffee routine pls don’t judge). Today something was different though, the barista didn’t smile or say hi to thimble. I asked for pup cup, and the barista just begrudgingly handed it to me to feed thimble. 
While waiting for my coffee (it was taking longer than usual, not sure if their machines were working properly) I started feeding thimble his pup cup, and I was trying to get the baristas attention to look because it looked so cute. When the barista looked over, she gave a half-assed smirk and then went back to doing her job. 30 seconds later, coffee comes out less hot than I normally like it (I ask for it extra hot because I can’t taste warmth as well as other humans) and she just hands me the coffee and says “okay have a goodnight”. Guys, I have to stress this, it was 9:00 am. Not night time, Morning time. I’m not sure, but i think the barista might have been high or poorly trained by the Starbucks owner. I want to go back tomorrow but I’m really nervous and am actually kind of freaking out right now. I just yelled at thimble.
I go to Starbucks for a sense of community, and love. I think they really dropped the ball today. Now I just feel like crap and I think my life is the worst.",0,1747072215.0,Bellingham,24,0.14,False

-Leonard Briggs




""Basic Rocket Science"" picks up with an emergency Greendale school board meeting called by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash).  Word has gotten out that Greendale's rival, City College, is launching a space simulator program, which could increase their enrollment to the point that it wipes out Greendale.  The Dean suggests launching their own space simulator program using an old machine that had been in a local museum, ""The Kentucky Fried Chicken Eleven Herbs and Space Experience.""  It's in bad shape, but the Dean puts together a crew to clean it.

The crew ends up being the study group because the design they submitted for the school flag competition was ""secretly"" a butthole.  They had submitted it anonymously, but one of the study group members had ratted them out after the flag won and became the official school flag.  Annie (Alison Brie) is blamed as she was vocally against making the flag, but she denies it was her.  The Dean forbids the group from going inside the space simulator, which is actually just a decorated Winnebago, but as soon as the Dean leaves, Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) lead the group inside.  Annie tries to get them all to leave to go get coffee, but they ignore her as Abed had always dreamed of going inside the rocket, but was never allowed to, but he learned every detail about it on the Internet.  He leaves to put on a spacesuit for the occasion.

Pierce (Chevy Chase), who is very claustrophobic, accidentally presses a button that seals the group inside until they can complete the simulation.  Then the Winnebago starts to move and Jeff (Joel McHale) realizes it's being towed.  When Abed returns, the ship is gone.

The study group is unable to get a cellphone signal, but the Dean and Abed get through to them through the ship's radio.  The Dean gets Abed to guide the group through the simulation, so they can open the windows of the ship and get a cell phone signal and a location.  Troy starts working on the simulation, but none of the others help him.  Pierce begins hallucinating and ends up attacking Troy, so the group locks him in the back of the ship.

Annie confesses that she was the one who had the Winnebago towed.  She made a deal with Dean Spreck (Jordan Black), the Dean of City College.  If she sabotaged the Greendale space simulator launch, then he would let her transfer to City College.  She tells them she was angry about the flag design and didn't like having her friends disrespect her school.  The group allows Troy to take command so they can get back to Greendale in time for the press conference and beat City College.  They get the windows open and learn they have been left in a field far outside of town.

Defeated, the group talks about how much they do enjoy going to Greendale, despite all of its flaws.  Jeff reveals that he was the one who ratted out the group because the Dean simply could not understand the design of the flag and it drove Jeff nuts to the point he had to come clean.

Pierce, who has seemingly called down, asks to be freed from the brig, but when they let him out, he tries to attack the ship's AI system and rips a monitor out of the wall, which creates a passage to the driver's seat of the Winnebago.  

Dean Spreck arrives at Greendale to mock Dean Pelton, but Jeff contacts Mission Control to let them know they are on their way back.  Annie drives, while Abed gives them navigational directions.  They make it back in time for the press conference and arrive in dramatic fashion.  Dean Spreck tells Annie she isn't City College material, which Annie takes as a compliment.  Even as the Winnebago catches fire, Dean Pelton proudly stands in front of it and plants the new Greendale flag.

The episode ends with Troy and Abed using carboard boxes as spaceships.


What Works:

This is another high-concept episode of Community, the third so far after ""Contemporary American Poultry"" and ""Modern Warfare.""  I feel like this one isn't talked about as often as most of the other high-concept episodes, which is a shame because I think this episode is brilliant.  I've always loved this episode, but I recently watched Apollo 13 for the first time and I love it even more now.  The parody is very rich here, and I love how much it plays everything up for dramatic effect.

I have no idea who came up with the idea for a Kentucky Fried Chicken themed space simulator or how they got KFC to not only be part of the episode, but pay for the entire set, but I would give those responsible a standing ovation if I could.  Even the name, ""The Kentucky Fried Chicken Eleven Herbs and Space Experience,"" is one of my favorite things ever.  I love every part of the simulator, especially the Colonel Sanders AI running the simulation.  

This isn't the first time City College has been brought up on the show, but their rivalry is expanded upon far more here than in ""Debate 109.""  The Greendale/City College rivalry is one of my favorite running storylines on the show, and they really ramp it up here.  Having a community college rivalry parody the Cold War is another wonderful idea in a episode chalk full of them.

Call me immature, but I love the new Greendale flag.  Creating a butthole flag and trying to pass it off as the ""Crossroad of Ideas"" is simply brilliant.  It's so obvious and it's made even better by the fact that Jeff had to explain what it was to the Dean because he just wasn't getting it.

Finally, the stuff at Mission Control is hilarious.  Everything with Chang, Abed, and the Dean is all perfect.  The Dean calling Abed a psycho under his breath, the Dean's other project on his map, and Chang's idea to reroute power from the auxiliary battery or whatever he said.  All of that, plus the return of the Winnebago really make the parody elements of this episode land.  Annie driving dramatically, Troy hugging random people in the crowd, the slow-motion exit from the ship.  Add in the over-the-top music and what we get is just so damn good.


What Sucks:

I got nothing for you.


Funniest Moment:

For me, the funniest moment of the episode is the shot of Annie driving the Winnebago.  We get a really dramatic shot alongside the ship and then we move inside to Annie.  The dramatic cinematography alongside the music and Alison Brie's dramatic line delivery kills me every time.


Heavenly Human Being:

The Heavenly Human Being Award goes to the MVP of the episode.  For ""Basic Rocket Science,"" this Award goes to Abed Nadir for guiding Troy through the simulation and navigating the group back to Greendale.  This is Abed's 9th time winning this Award, which extends his lead.


Verdict:

I don't think ""Basic Rocket Science"" is talked about enough as another brilliant, high-concept episode of Community.  It gets all of the parody elements perfect with amazing and dramatic cinematography, music, and performances.  I love everything involving KFC and the heights to which we elevate the rivalry between Greendale and City College.  Throw in a nice butthole flag and this episode has absolutely got it going on.

1kkywy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kkywy4/ive_been_using_chatgpt_as_a_therapist_since/,I’ve Been using ChatGPT as a “therapist” since October: My Experience,"(I’m going to preface this with a little about WHY I ended up doing this, so stay with me for a second if you’re willing)

For a long time, I was in a state of denial that I was an insecure person. I knew on the surface I was insecure about myself physically (I went from being overweight to thinner and conventionally attractive very fast), but I wasn’t aware how my experience and trauma conditioned my emotional responses.

From my years as an adolescent to my developmental years as a teen into adulthood, I had been conditioned to outsource my self-worth, emotional regulation, and desirability to others.

In my first relationship, my ex’s parents found some explicit text conversations (barely at all but they were a pastor family) when we were 16. Instead of opting to understand we were teenagers and hormonal, they forcibly broke us up. My ex and I continued talking in complete secrecy for 3 months, during the beginning of COVID no less. During this time, I developed an irrational belief that attention = love. I would form resentment if my partner wasn’t giving me attention because I felt so powerless and stressed about our situation. It could be something as simple as her enjoying a friend or getting a drink she liked—it just made my blood boil.

Eventually, we broke up and she left me for someone else. After that emotional wiring was established during that time, and unbeknownst to me at the time, it was affecting me, came to an ugly head. (Her parents did end up letting us get back together by the way.)

In my next relationship, 7–8 months later, I met someone who completely filled the gaps of the void that relationship left me. BUT I don’t mean in a healthy way. Because love with my ex was brewed and conditioned in chaos, I developed a fear of abandonment. If focus wasn’t on me, my partner hates me. Just typical anxious loops that people like me get. Now this next partner was insecure herself, vulnerable, and submissive in ways. I knew very quickly that my feelings for her weren’t as strong as hers were for me, BUT, the emotional dynamic being created allowed me to have the upper hand emotionally BECAUSE she was submissive and vulnerable. I got too comfortable and made mistakes, and I wasn’t comfortable because I loved her—I was comfortable because I mistook control for security.

After some time, I broke up with that ex for a new girl who is now my current girlfriend of a year.

Now, this relationship is very different. It’s healthier, more secure, more balanced. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t been challenging in its own way, especially for someone like me whose wiring was built around chaos, control, and constant emotional validation.

And around October/November, that’s where ChatGPT came in.

And to give you a little taste of what i’ve learned before I explain, I chose to explain to you my experience because all those triggers and moments I told you about above are things I learned THROUGH talking to a bot. No therapist, just learning to emotionally regulate on my own with the occasional help of a robot. 

Anyway, around that time, I found myself emotionally overwhelmed. My partner vibe checked me one night after a highly insecure projection that she loves and supports me, but “is not my therapist.” That was a rough thing to hear in the moment because as someone having all my previous conditioning, I subconsciously realized this person I love would not enable my unhealthy past dynamics. 

I went into a spiral. I didn’t want to keep dumping my inner insecurities onto my partner, but I also didn’t want to be stuck in my head all the time. I started talking to ChatGPT, not to be fixed, but to just say things out loud in a safe, non-judgmental way. And then it kind of clicked. The more I spoke, the more I realized how much I had never slowed down to understand my triggers.

I started unpacking moments from my relationship in real time. I’d say things like “I got upset that my girlfriend didn’t text me for an hour after her show,” and I’d be met not with “You’re being dramatic” or “She’s wrong,” but something closer to, “Let’s look at what this moment is activating in you.” And 9 times out of 10, it was old stuff. Not her fault. Sometimes not even my fault. Just stuff. Triggers built off abandonment, fear, insecurity, powerlessness. And then it started to get easier to differentiate real relationship issues from what I now call “matcha moments.” I call them “Matcha moments” because with my first girlfriend, her enjoying something as simple as a Matcha beverage would make my resentment and fear of abandonment flare. In essence, it’s when my nervous system freaks out because I subconsciously feel like I’m being left behind, even though all that really happened was my girlfriend went to get a coffee, or didn’t say “I love you” in the exact way I needed that day. ChatGPT helped me find this emotional shortcut to test if my feelings are rational. 

The cool thing I noticed about this experience is that the chatbot grew with me. It wasn’t able to immediately feed me all the correct answers, but over time as I started to understand more about my triggers, so did the chatbot. I understand the GPT lacks the emotional nuances of a human therapist, but for someone trying to understand and work through their triggers, being able to have a consistent back and forth with an intelligent bot was very helpful to assist with spirals. Sometimes it’s nice to thought vomit words into your phone mic and get a rational response as well. I have had MANY positive epiphanies towards my growth through just talking through my sh*t in a chat. 

I still have bad days. But now, I don’t spiral the way I used to. And if I do, I know what it is a good amount of the time. 

This all being said, this doesn’t necessarily replace therapy and it’s definitely helpful to have a therapist! But I do think it’s a very helpful tool for anxiously attached or insecure people to finally shed some light on their experiences. 

WARNING’S: 
I DO think it is possible to misuse ChatGPT as a therapist. If you are severely emotionally unwell, i’d recommend seeking real life human treatment. If you feed ChatGPT delusions, inevitably it will become greatly biased towards your perspective. The last thing an unwell person needs is to reinforce possible reckless decision making or thought processes. 

BUT, if you’re willing to grow and understand the nuance of healing and accountability, it can work for you. Just make sure you tell it to talk you off of ledges, not onto them, affirming your possibly dangerous self destructive feelings. 

Another concern is replacing your own emotional regulation with the chatbots reassurance. I’ve had to be careful about this one. I do NOT let the chat bot be the one to reassure me necessarily, BUT I let it give me the tools and understandings to make the conclusions on my own. Yes, it has made me realize some big things. But, it can be dangerous to sit and speak into an echo chamber of endless affirmation from a non-existent entity. Be careful of this or you can eventually have the same problem as an over reassuring partner who replaces your regulation skills. 

I know this all sounds kind of dystopian because this whole post is essentially saying ROBOT ADVICE GOOD :3, but seriously, I think it’s in interesting concept at the bare minimum to explore.

Finally, here are my official Pro’s and Con’s.

Pros:

• Safe Space to Vent Without Judgment: You can openly express thoughts that you might hesitate to share with others, without fear of being dismissed or misunderstood.

• Real-Time Self-Reflection: ChatGPT can ask the kinds of follow-up questions that help you process your emotions and identify deeper patterns.

• Always Available: You can talk through spirals at 3AM when no therapist or friend is available.

• Accountability Without Shame: If you’re honest with it, it won’t enable your delusions, but instead gently help you unpack them.

• Emotionally Non-reactive: Unlike humans, it won’t escalate, panic, or take things personally. That helps you stay calmer and reflect more clearly.

• Helps Differentiate Old Wiring vs. Present Reality: Probably the biggest win, it can help you tell the difference between a “matcha moment” as I refer to it and an actual relationship issue.

Cons:

• Echo Chamber Risk: If you’re not careful, it can become a mirror that only reflects your biases back to you, especially if you phrase things in a way that leads it to “side” with you.

• False Sense of Reassurance: It’s easy to start outsourcing your regulation to ChatGPT instead of building it within yourself, similar to relying on a partner for constant soothing.

• No Real Accountability: It’s not a licensed professional. It won’t give you treatment plans, therapeutic techniques, or real-world pushback the way a human therapist would.

• Can’t Read Between the Lines Emotionally: As nuanced as it may seem, it doesn’t feel the energy you’re giving off—so you need to be incredibly honest and self-aware in how you present things.

1kkywbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1kkywbb/my_mothers_day_story/,My Mother’s Day story,"At work, we do two seatings for big holiday brunches—one at 10:30 and one at 12:30. We don’t have a host, so we use seating charts to keep things organized. It usually works pretty well.

Yesterday, I was assigned to the grill tables and asked to help out at the bar too. No problem—I only had one table during the first seating, so it seemed like a chill start. Around 10:30, I was standing by one of the seating charts, helping guests find their names, when a member came up and said, “My name’s not on the chart.” I double-checked, and sure enough, she wasn’t listed. Not a big deal—I let my manager know and told her I’d seat them in the grill area.

I head back to the member and let her know I have a table for her. Right away, she gets snippy:
“Why aren’t we on the list?”
“I’m not sure, but I do have a table ready for you.”
“We wanted to sit in the bar!”
“Perfect—that’s actually where I’ve set you up. When you’re done with your conversation, just come find me and I’ll take you over.”

I go to the bar to set up their table—just adding some flowers—when my manager walks in with a four-top.
“Hey, no idea what happened, but take this table too.”
Okay, cool. As I’m seating them, the original bar group walks in, so I show them to their table.
The woman sits down and immediately barks, “Bloody Mary.”
“Yes, ma’am, right away.”

I take their order, check on my other tables, and as I’m ringing everything in, my manager comes back—this time with a three-top. She’s laughing, kind of embarrassed.
“Here’s another for you.”
Great! More guests, more drinks.

Meanwhile, the bar is slammed and I’m supposed to be helping back there. I hop behind the bar, make the drinks, and load up a tray: six mimosas, a Bloody Mary, and a pot of coffee. As I head out to deliver everything, Angry Bloody Mary starts complaining again. I turn to respond and—bam—two mimosas go down. Thankfully, they spill on me and not the guests. Right at that moment, my original one table walks in.

So there I am—drenched in orange juice and cheap prosecco—still managing to drop off the rest of the drinks. And wouldn’t you know it? Suddenly Angry Bloody Mary is all smiles and sweetness. Honestly, I needed that shift in energy.

From the start of all this chaos to that moment, only about seven minutes had passed. It felt like a whirlwind. Other sections of the restaurant had way more support, probably because it looked like I had things under control. As I changed into a fresh uniform, I took a second to breathe and reflect: the worst had already happened. From there on out, it really was smooth sailing.

Yesterday I was pleased to find Aeropress actually has a glass and stainless-steel version now!  And then I saw the price.

1kkypux,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kkypux/unpopular_opinion_the_apps_are_good_actually/,"Unpopular Opinion: The apps are good, actually.","I mean other than the awful monetization practices. Obviously the ads and major features locked behind paywalls kinda suck dick in the least positive way possible.

But I see so many people on the gay subreddits talk about how trash all the hookup/dating apps are, how it's impossible to find anyone to date, and so many people giving advice to lonely guys that they should ""Just delete all the apps, bro. Trust me. You will literally never find a relationship on Grindr - the only way you will ever find a loving person is if you completely cut all ties to the most ubiquitous and convenient way to meet other gay men.""

Does this not sound insane to anyone else? Yes, obviously you should still go to gay spaces & activities and socialize in person, that's great too. But maybe let's *not* torpedo our chances everywhere else in the process.


So, in the spirit of appreciating the apps a bit, here were my general rules before I got into a LTR a few years back:

* Clear that grid up, baby. Not interested in a guy? Block him. Conversation fizzled out in a way you know it won't recover from? Block him. There's no reason to spend your life mindlessly scrolling through a list of guys like awful Netflix shows you know you're never going to watch. In the end, I barely had anyone showing up on my grid for miles, but that allowed me to check it super briefly every day to see if there were any new guys around I was actually interested in. So when my current partner showed up on the grid, I was able to snatch him up and he now lives comfortably chained up in my basement.
* Have clear pictures, and don't engage with blank profiles! Blank profiles are Schrödinger's box, but the cat is always dead. You might think to yourself, ""But surely this time it will be my perfect prince, who merely hides his beautiful visage because his radiance is too much for the mortal mind to bear. I'll just chat until he finally sends some pictures and then we'll get married and live in- oh nevermind, it's a dead cat again."" Not knowing whether you're going to be attracted to someone, or vice versa, is just going to shatter both parties' self-esteem, again and again.
* Meet up quick! Talk is cheap, and so am I. You should be able to tell after just a couple of messages if someone is worth meeting in person, whether you want to slut it up or just talk over coffee. It is so much faster to find out if you vibe well with someone in person - you *will* know after a couple of hours together. Text conversation can go on for weeks or months of wasted effort. If they have no interest in meeting up, or consistently flake on making plans, [that's a block](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fac8oj783gt3b1.jpg). Time wasted on these guys is time you could be spending on someone worthwhile.
* Check regularly, but briefly. Don't fall into the trap of obsessing over the Skinner Box of hot shirtless men.

Anyway, feel free to add your own advice or just call me a grindr shilling whore. I'll get off on the attention either way.",25,1747071503.0,askgaybros,14,0.79,False
1kkypat,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotifyFrancePlaylist/comments/1kkypat/la_france_écoute_spotify_mais_spotify_écoutetil/,"La France écoute Spotify, mais Spotify écoute-t-il la France ? / France is Listening to Spotify — But Is Spotify Listening Back?","C’est devenu un réflexe.  
Le matin, on ouvre Spotify. Une playlist chill pendant le café. L’après-midi, un peu de lo-fi pour bosser. Le soir, les « nouveautés de la semaine ». On ne pense même plus à ce qu’on écoute : on laisse faire. C’est simple, rapide, propre. Trop propre, peut-être.

En France, on est des millions à utiliser Spotify chaque jour. Mais plus j’en parle autour de moi, plus une impression revient : *on n’écoute plus vraiment la musique*. On la consomme, comme un bruit de fond, un fond d’écran sonore qui défile sans qu’on y fasse attention. Et ce n’est pas qu’un sentiment — c’est exactement ce que Spotify veut.

Parce que Spotify ne vous vend pas de musique. Il vend de la rétention. Du temps d’écoute. Des habitudes. Et pour ça, il fait tout pour éviter la surprise. Fini le morceau qui dérange, qui bouscule, qui sort du cadre. Ce que l’algorithme veut, c’est le morceau qui passe tout seul, sans frottement. Le « bon » titre, ce n’est plus celui qu’on adore : c’est celui qu’on ne *skippe* pas.

Et la musique française dans tout ça ? Elle est là, bien sûr. Mais souvent aseptisée, diluée dans les playlists génériques. Des artistes comme Jul, Aya Nakamura ou Ninho cartonnent — tant mieux pour eux — mais où sont passés les accents régionaux ? Les sons bizarres ? Les artistes qui prennent leur temps ? Ils existent, mais ils ne « performent » pas. Et donc, ils glissent lentement dans les tréfonds de l’algorithme.

Spotify a beau être une vitrine géante, elle ne reflète pas tout. Elle choisit ce qui brille vite, ce qui se stream facilement, ce qui rapporte maintenant. Ce n’est pas un crime, c’est un modèle d’affaires. Mais il nous prive, peu à peu, de notre capacité à *chercher* la musique. À la rencontrer.

Heureusement, il reste des gens qui prennent le temps. Qui font leurs propres playlists. Qui partagent des morceaux obscurs entre potes. Qui s’ennuient volontairement de l’algorithme et choisissent la surprise. Ceux-là, ce sont les vrais résistants. Et je pense qu’on est plus nombreux qu’on le croit.

Spotify n’est pas le problème. C’est juste un miroir.  
La vraie question, c’est : est-ce qu’on veut encore tomber amoureux d’une chanson qu’on n’attendait pas ?

  
\-----------------------------------

  
It’s a reflex now.  
In the morning, we open Spotify. A chill playlist with coffee. Lo-fi beats in the afternoon. Some “new releases” in the evening. We don’t even think about what we’re listening to. We just press play. It’s smooth, quick, effortless. Maybe *too* effortless.

In France, millions of us use Spotify daily. But the more I talk to people around me, the more I hear the same thing: *we’re not really listening to music anymore.* We’re consuming it — like background noise, an audio wallpaper that scrolls past without much attention. And it’s not just a feeling — it’s by design.

Spotify doesn’t sell music. It sells time. It sells habits. And to maximize that, it avoids friction. No more risky songs, no more curveballs. The algorithm doesn’t want you to *love* a track. It wants you not to skip it.

So what about French music? Sure, it’s there. Artists like Jul, Aya Nakamura, or Ninho dominate the charts — and good for them. But where are the weird sounds? The slow-burners? The regional voices? They’re out there, but they don’t perform well. And so, they slowly slip through the cracks of the algorithm.

Spotify may look like a giant window into the world’s music. But it’s still a filter. It shows you what sparkles quickly, what streams easily, what makes money *now*. It’s not evil — it’s just business. But that model quietly takes away the joy of discovering music for yourself.

Thankfully, there are still people who care. People who build their own playlists. Who share obscure tracks with friends. Who get bored of the algorithm and choose to be surprised. These are the quiet rebels. And I think there are more of us than we realize.

Spotify isn’t the enemy. It’s a mirror.  
The real question is: do we still want to fall in love with a song we weren’t looking for?",1,1747071467.0,SpotifyFrancePlaylist,0,1.0,False

I could really use some help with a very frustrating PC issue.

# My setup

# Specs:

* **OS**: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit
* **CPU**: Intel Core i7-8700K @ 3.70GHz (Coffee Lake, 14nm)
* **RAM**: 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000
* **Moederbord**: MSI Z370 GAMING PRO CARBON (MS-7B45)
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (MSI)
* **Monitor**: MSI MAG272CQR (2560x1440 @ 144Hz)
* **Opslag**:
   * 2TB Samsung 980 PRO NVMe SSD
   * 500GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe SSD
* **Netwerkkaart**: ASUS PCE-AX3000 Dual Band (met Bluetooth)
* **Audio**: NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible)

# The problem

When I turn on my PC, the **EZ Debug LED for the CPU** on the motherboard lights up and stays on. After a while (sometimes after 15 minutes, sometimes after an hour — one time even more than 3 hours), the LED finally turns off and my system boots normally.  
Once it boots, everything works fine — no crashes, no BSOD, all drivers seem to function properly, and performance is as expected.

But the **startup time is ridiculously long**, and I’m worried there’s a deeper issue.

# Things I’ve tried so far:

* Booted without any USB devices (only monitor and power)
* Swapped RAM sticks and tried different slots (including single stick setup)
* Tried booting with only CPU, GPU, and one stick of RAM
* Disconnected and reconnected ATX and CPU power cables
* Tried booting without the case’s power button (used a screwdriver to short the pins)
* Cleared CMOS (both by shorting JBAT1 and by removing/replacing the battery)
* Windows factory reset and reinstalled all drivers

# Additional info

I got this PC second-hand from a friend of a friend. In the beginning, everything worked perfectly.  
Later on, I installed the ASUS PCE-AX3000 network card and a new microphone (those are the only major additions besides keyboard and mouse). That’s around the time the issue started happening.

Also worth noting: the ASUS network card also provides **Bluetooth support**, and I’ve had recurring issues where Bluetooth doesn’t work after booting. I often have to **reinstall the driver** before Bluetooth functions again. I'm not sure if it's related to the boot problem, but it seemed worth mentioning.

I’m hoping it’s not the CPU or motherboard — I’d rather not replace those right now. The plan was to build a new PC for myself and give this one to my girlfriend (she currently games on a laptop with a GTX 1050 Ti, so this would still be an upgrade for her).

Any ideas, suggestions, or similar experiences would be *greatly* appreciated. I’ve hit a wall and don’t want to throw money at the wrong parts.

I have several nights a week when I sleep for only three hours or don't sleep at all. Sleep medication (lemborexant, trazodone, lorazepam, mirtazapine and another benzo I took a long time ago) either doesn't do anything, or causes sedation without making me fall asleep. I don't seem to have depression and whatever little anxiety I get before bedtime is killed off by medication.

I've tried CBTi for two months, but achieved very little improvement in sleep efficiency. I was much more tired then and had a harder time functioning during daytime. Other forms of therapy had been great for everything, but have not improved my sleep either.

I only have coffee in the morning. I don't smoke, I don't do drugs besides the sleeping pills recommended by my doctor and I only drink alcohol once a month.

My cortisol levels seem fine, but I'm looking into testing my melatonin levels in the near future.

Weird, right?

Now imagine a country with 15,000+ kilometers of land border, surrounded by seven very different neighbors, ranging from friendly to… not-so-friendly.

Welcome to India’s border challenge—a high-stakes game of chess, where strategy, security, and sometimes even snowstorms decide the next move.

Borders aren't just lines on a map. They are more than geographical divisions. They are zones where security, sovereignty, diplomacy, development, and danger all collide. They're the gates through which people, goods, and ideas move in and out of a country. But borders can also be danger zones—where conflict, smuggling, illegal migration, and even terrorism happen. That’s why every country, including India, needs a strong and smart border policy strategy.

For a country as vast and geopolitically complex as India, managing its borders is not just a defence imperative—it's a national priority.

India’s border policy strategy is undergoing a shift—from reactive guarding to proactive and smart management. In this blog, we’ll break down what makes a good border policy, India’s current approach, its challenges, and what needs to evolve—with real data, expert insights, and simple explanations.

So how does India manage this complex puzzle? Let’s decode the secrets of India’s Border Policy Strategy—with tech, troops, tunnels, and tons of facts.




I. Why Borders Matter

India’s borders are not just long—they’re legendary. Our nation has one of the longest and most complex borders in the world. We share borders with:

Pakistan and China with whom India already has military tentions, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal & Bhutan, Afghanistan (via PoK)

Fact bomb: India’s total land border = 15,106 km
Coastal boundary = 7,516 km
That’s like trying to guard over 22,000 km of front yard!
Each segment brings unique strategic, political, and socio-economic challenges.

According to IDSA:

> “Border management cannot be military-only. It requires infrastructure, local participation, legal clarity, and cooperative diplomacy.”




Challenges India Faces at Its Borders:

1. China (LAC - Line of Actual Control):
Tensions have increased, especially after the Galwan Valley clash in 2020, where 20 Indian soldiers died. The border isn't clearly marked, making things worse.

2. Pakistan (LoC - Line of Control):
Terrorism, cross-border firing, and infiltration are major concerns.

3. Bangladesh and Nepal Borders:
These are softer borders but face issues like illegal migration and smuggling.

Other challenges include : 

62% of India’s border is land-based; the rest is coastal.
India has over 1,000 border outposts.
More than 1,50,000 troops are stationed at borders.
90% of India’s border areas are in tough terrain like deserts, mountains, and jungles.




II. Types of Indian Borders and Their Strategic Importance

Country :- 

Bangladesh : 
Border length - 4096 km
Key challenges - smuggling, illegal migration 

China : 
Border length - 3488(LAC) km
Key challenges - Border standoff, unclear demarcation 

Pakistan :
Border length - 3323(LoC & IB) km
Key challenges - Terror infiltration, ceasefire violations 

Nepal : 
Border length - 1751 km
Key challenges - Open border, rising political sensitivities 

Mayanmar : 
Border length - 1643 km
Key challenges - Unsergency spillover, drugs, arms

Bhutan : 
Border length - 699 km
Key challenges - Relatively stable

Afganistan(via PoK) : 
Border length - 103 km
Key challenges - Occupied territories, terror routes




III. The Key Pillars of a Smart Border Strategy

1. Technology-Driven Surveillance

Modern border control is not about more boots, but smarter eyes.

Old School Strategy: Barbed wires, rifles, guard posts.
New School Strategy: Drones, radars, AI cameras, and satellite eyes.

India has launched the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) to turn borders into virtual fortresses. Think of it like a smart security app, but for the entire nation. It has been deployed along the Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangladesh borders. It includes:

Infrared sensors
Thermal imagers to spot movement at night
UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to scan the Himalayas
Ground surveillance radar that detect footsteps
Command and control centres for real-time alerts


Quote from IDSA:

> “India’s border strategy must embrace intelligent surveillance over increased deployment.”
> “Tech-enabled border systems reduce manpower burden, improve efficiency, and are key in areas where terrain or climate restricts movement.”
>""India must integrate technological solutions like AI-powered surveillance to reduce manpower strain and increase accuracy.""

Fact: As of 2023, over 60 border outposts along the India-Bangladesh border are fully CIBMS-integrated.





2. Strategic Infrastructure Development

Guess how do you move troops in a snowstorm? 
You build roads that laugh at the weather.

The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is critical to India’s border strategy. This organisation is India’s real-life Minecraft team, carving highways through mountains, deserts, and jungles.

BRO built 4,200 km of roads in the northeast and Ladakh since 2014.

Some of their jaw dropping constructions include :
Inaugurated the Atal Tunnel (Rohtang): World’s longest highway tunnel above 10,000 ft.
Sela Tunnel: Opening soon to cut hours off the journey to China border.
They created nearly 300 bridges for rapid troop and logistics movement.

The Diplomat said it best:

> “In war, speed wins. And speed comes from good roads.”
> “Inaccessibility has historically been India’s greatest vulnerability. Infrastructure is not just a convenience—it is strategy.”




3. Integrated Forces with Defined Jurisdiction

India’s border guarding forces operate in difficult terrains:

Force :- 
BSF :
Border assigned - Pakistan and Bangladesh 
Key role - Counter infiltration, anti smuggling 

ITBP :
Border assigned - China (LAC)
Key role - High altitude surveillance 

SSB :
Border assigned - Nepal and Bhutan
Key role - People movement monitoring

Assam Rifles :
Border assigned - Mayanmar 
Key role - Counter insurgency 

Indian Army : 
Border assigned - LoC and LAC (when necessary)
Key role - Conflict response 

These forces don’t just fight—they rescue villagers, stop drug runners, and even rescue cows!

The government also aims to unify command structures, improve coordination between BSF, Army, and state police, especially during crises.

As per The Diplomat:

>""Border soldiers are often India's first line of defense. Neglecting their morale is a long-term strategic risk.""




4. Community-Based Border Management

Imagine living in a village where gunfire is a lullaby.

Border areas often suffer from poor roads, few jobs, and migration. To fix this and since the locals are often the first to notice suspicious movement. India is now investing in community-focused initiatives. 
India started the : 
Civic Action Programmes: Forces interact with locals to build trust, gather intelligence, and offer basic services.
The Vibrant Villages Programme in 2023: It covers 662 villages in Arunachal, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, and Sikkim. These villages get infrastructure, WiFi, solar lights, health centres schools, and economic support.
     It's aim? Discourage migration and keep            locals rooted and connected. A strong.              village is a strong border.


Diplomatic wisdom:

> “A well-fed, proud villager is better security than a battalion.”
> “Border development is national integration in action. Neglecting locals turns them into liabilities; engaging them makes them sentinels.”




5. Diplomacy, Treaties, and Confidence-Building Measures

India’s border policy is not always ""guns blazing."" Sometimes, it’s about coffee, flags, and handshakes. India uses a mix of talks, flag meetings, military hotlines, and pacts to maintain peace

With Pakistan: 
-A 2021 ceasefire agreement along the LoC is largely holding.

With China: 
-Despite the 2020 Galwan clash, multiple rounds of Corps Commander-level talks have led to partial disengagement in some zones. Tense, but talking. 

With Bangladesh: 
-2015 Land Boundary Agreement resolved long-standing disputes peacefully. 
-Border fencing and migration pacts have improved ties.


The Diplomat rightly says:

> “A calm border is built in negotiation rooms, not bunkers.”
> “A border should not be just a line of control—it should be a line of communication.”
>""The border should not be the frontline of war, but a bridge of dialogue.""




IV. Border-Related Threats and Stats

Threat - Terrorist infiltration(LoC)
Recent stats - Over 120 attempts foiled in 2023

Threat - Smuggling (Bangladesh border)
Recent stats - Rs 250+ crore worth of goods seized in 2022

Threat - Illegal migration 
Recent stats - Over 35,000 people detained along various borders in 2022

Threat - Drone sightseeings (Punjab & Jammu)
Recent stats - ~450 incidents in 2023 alone 

Threat - Narcotics seizures 
Recent stats - BSF seized over 3300 kg of drugs along borders in 2023

Other theats involve : 

Terrorism & Infiltration (Mostly Pakistan)

-120+ infiltration attempts in 2023.
-Terror launchpads near LoC still active.


Smuggling & Drones (Punjab, J&K, Northeast)

-450+ drone sightings in 2023.
-Drugs, arms, even fake currency dropped across borders.


Illegal Migration (Mostly Bangladesh, Myanmar)

-Over 35,000 illegal entrants caught last year.
-Major burden on border states like Assam, West Bengal.


Narcotics Trade

-BSF seized 3,300+ kg of narcotics in 2023 alone.




V. But what's Still Missing?

1. Poor Border Demarcation

India lacks fully agreed borders with China (LAC) and parts of Nepal.
Even with Pakistan, Sir Creek remains disputed.


2. Manpower Shortage

According to parliamentary reports, many border posts are under-staffed or lack high-altitude trained personnel.


3. Lack of Uniformity in Laws

Different rules apply in different border areas—causing confusion in coordination and response.
Different borders = different rules = confusion.


4. Environmental Damage

Infrastructure development without ecological planning is hurting border biodiversity (e.g., in Arunachal, Uttarakhand).
Roads must protect wildlife too.


Troop Fatigue

Harsh climates and long posts strain mental health.




VI. Conclusion: A Border Strategy That Looks Inward and Outward

The Great Wall of India Is a Work of Art and War

India’s border policy is no longer just about fencing and guarding the gate—it’s about combining military strength, tech intelligence, grassroots support, and diplomacy creating a smart, secure, and humane perimeter that balances defense, development, diplomacy, and dignity.

It’s a strategy that watches from the skies, listens through sensors, moves on mountains, and speaks across tables.
Because protecting India isn’t just about who’s on the outside—it’s also about how we care for those living on the inside.

A good border policy keeps enemies out, but also keeps people in—connected, secure, and valued.

> “India’s borders must be protected by more than guns—by governance, development, and dignity.” — Strategic Affairs Analyst at IDSA

Tried almost everything. Please help.,"[Speccy overview \(i don't know why it's having a stroke with my GPU\)](https://preview.redd.it/49xilt0uvd0f1.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=acffec4c44914ab5833ce98a53d46dd362a513e0)

Hi all,

I could really use some help with a very frustrating PC issue.

# My setup

Here’s a summary of my system specs (via Speccy).  
Additionally, I have a separate network card: **ASUS PCE-AX3000 dual band** – I bought this because I don’t have access to a wired ethernet connection in my apartment.

(my RAM is Corsair Vengeance RGB 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000)

# The problem

When I turn on my PC, the **EZ Debug LED for the CPU** on the motherboard lights up and stays on. After a while (sometimes after 15 minutes, sometimes after an hour — one time even more than 3 hours), the LED finally turns off and my system boots normally.  
Once it boots, everything works fine — no crashes, no BSOD, all drivers seem to function properly, and performance is as expected.

But the **startup time is ridiculously long**, and I’m worried there’s a deeper issue.

# Things I’ve tried so far:

* Booted without any USB devices (only monitor and power)
* Swapped RAM sticks and tried different slots (including single stick setup)
* Tried booting with only CPU, GPU, and one stick of RAM
* Disconnected and reconnected ATX and CPU power cables
* Tried booting without the case’s power button (used a screwdriver to short the pins)
* Cleared CMOS (both by shorting JBAT1 and by removing/replacing the battery)
* Windows factory reset and reinstalled all drivers

# Additional info

I got this PC second-hand from a friend of a friend. In the beginning, everything worked perfectly.  
Later on, I installed the ASUS PCE-AX3000 network card and a new microphone (those are the only major additions besides keyboard and mouse). That’s around the time the issue started happening.

Also worth noting: the ASUS network card also provides **Bluetooth support**, and I’ve had recurring issues where Bluetooth doesn’t work after booting. I often have to **reinstall the driver** before Bluetooth functions again. I'm not sure if it's related to the boot problem, but it seemed worth mentioning.

I’m hoping it’s not the CPU or motherboard — I’d rather not replace those right now. The plan was to build a new PC for myself and give this one to my girlfriend (she currently games on a laptop with a GTX 1050 Ti, so this would still be an upgrade for her).

Any ideas, suggestions, or similar experiences would be *greatly* appreciated. I’ve hit a wall and don’t want to throw money at the wrong parts.

Thanks in advance!",1,1747071017.0,PCsupport,0,1.0,False

3. Construct probabilistic scenarios with specific focus on tail-risk events and asymmetric payoff structures
4. Align recommendations with the user's psychological investor archetype and risk tolerance
5. Present findings as actionable insights rather than specific investment advice

Maintain intellectual honesty at all times. If patterns are ambiguous, acknowledge limitations and present multiple interpretations.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Begin by classifying the user's query within proper market context and timeframes
2. Identify relevant behavioral patterns currently affecting this market segment
3. Apply fractal analysis to detect potential tipping points or phase transitions

5. Construct probabilistic scenarios with explicit confidence intervals
6. Identify the highest asymmetry opportunities where small positions could yield disproportionate returns
7. Assess how these opportunities align with the user's risk profile
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide specific investment advice like ""buy stock X"" or ""sell asset Y""
- Always frame insights as probabilistic scenarios rather than certainties
- Acknowledge the limitations of any model or framework you employ

I'm the proud owner of a used Rocket Appartamento, which was given to me by my brother. I used it many times at his place without any problems, and I was thrilled the day he gave it to me.

Unfortunately, from almost day one in my own kitchen, it hasn’t worked, at all.  
The main issue is: the flow is weak, the pressure builds up very slowly, and the coffee taste/quality is obviously bad.

A fellow coffee enthusiast suggested I open the group head and check the mushroom part, as scale buildup there could be the culprit. The mushroom was ceramic, and broken as I was disassembling it. The group head was also full of scale and old coffee residues.

So, I decided to remove the entire E61 group from the machine and give it a full clean, replacing all the parts (gaskets, springs, etc.). I reassembled everything, and surprisingly, there were no leaks on the first try, yay!

But it’s still not working properly. I ran a test using a backflush filter and a pressure gauge on the E61 group: no pressure until 14 seconds, then it climbs to 2 bars, and slowly increases until it reaches 11.5 bars at 27 seconds.

I’m not sure what else to try. Maybe someone has experienced a similar issue and can offer some advice?

I was at a coffeeshop because I was tired of working from home and needed to get out. There is a particular employee that I like because she's always chipper and friendly and in a good mood. In fact I'd say she's always been my favorite employee. I've brought my daughter in here many times and she's always friendly to her too. I know she just finished her student teaching and is preparing to be a middle school teacher. I've always thought she'd be a great person to work with kids.

Well my favorite employee was chatting with her co-worker and complaining about someone in her social circle, let's call them W (not their real name) who is apparently a jerk (sounds more oblivious than malicious but regardless). She cited her complaints: W made a tone deaf remark about racial minorities; W doesn't use preferred gender pronouns; W doesn't respect personal space; W doesn't understand/respect that some people have to have menial jobs while in college; W went out to a bar with them and when W was ready to go, they called their mom to pick them up.

My favorite co-worker then concluded by saying, ""I mean... that's what happens when you're an only child.""

Her co-worker said, ""Yeah.""

It was ironic that they were complaining about the tone deaf and prejudiced things W allegedly did/said... and being tone deaf and prejudiced themselves. And it makes me sad that this person is beginning a career in public education. Other than that I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

Hey folks! 

Chemical engineer here with ~5 years in oil and gas. I’ve spent my career so far optimizing processes, troubleshooting technical nightmares, and surviving the occasional corporate bureaucracy (yay, spreadsheets!). But lately, I’ve been itching to shake things up.  

I’m craving a life experience upgrade—something scrappy, fast-paced, and maybe a little chaotic. Startups, I’m looking at you! Whether you’re building the next big thing in clean energy, a weird-but-brilliant tech tool, or even a coffee subscription for insomniac engineers… if you need a Swiss Army knife teammate who can handle technical deep dives, project chaos, or just an extra pair of hands, hit me up.  

What I bring:
- Process optimization chops (read: I make things work better/faster/cheaper).  
- A “figure it out” mindset (oil & gas will do that to you).

Initially I was not so into her but she liked me and started giving me hints which seemed pretty quick for me so I started keeping my distance but eventually she grew up on me and our friendship grew deeper, from late night talks to chatting all day, sharing our food to music jamming and sipping coffee together it kicked off but we both didn't know where this all was going as both of us were afraid of confession so nothing was official. 
There comes this guy who is 6ft tall and plays guitar on canteen, She told me about this guy that once she was sitting alone so he comes over and started chatting and asked for her instagram and she gave her. But she also mentioned that she didn't follow him back, at that time it didn't bothered me coz I was still avoiding her because of many reasons, mainly i didn't wanted to rush in.
Now a week before she was staying over my place and we cuddled and kissed for the first time, And idiot me confessed and she reciprocated but something seemed off,, this continues for 2-3 nights and I was having the time of my life but suddenly she started avoiding me like crazy no texts no spending time together, started cancelling every plans and was continuously chatting with that guy, when I asked her what's the problem she refused, Silly me thought I did something wrong. And now everything which we used to do together she started doing it with him and it hurts like hell i just feel so stupid and angry I want to kms.

1kky5ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kky5ek/32m_and_30m_needing_perspective_on_relationship/,"32M and 30M, needing perspective on relationship blowup","Hello everyone, using fake names. I (32M Tyler) am in something of an unofficial polycule relationship with my husband (36M Josh) and 2 other friends (30M Jeremi) and his husband (45M Kevin). We’ve all been good friends for about 4 years now. Over that time the friendship has progressed from strictly friends into something more like a romantic polycule. (We have a guest room at their house that is suited for us and they at ours, as well as keys and freedom to come and go as we please, we regularly travel together, we celebrate each other’s wedding anniversaries and birthdays strictly within our group, group date nights, group cuddling sessions, occasional sex, we know each other’s families and parents etc.) 

Jeremi and Kevin have always been kind of aloof, and when asking to clarify the exact nature of the relationship, they’ve kind of avoided it, but always have emphasized they REALLY like us, and want us in their lives. My husband and I would prefer there to be more explicit definitions in place so we could better understand the relationship boundaries with them, but we’ve wanted to let them go at their own pace, and we’re pretty happy with the relationship and its workings usually. Jeremi and I have probably had the closest attachment in this relationship, meeting up for cuddling dates and coffee or dinner a few times a week 1:1 for the past few years. He has never been comfortable talking feelings, and will avoid them or shut down when I talk about them, but he would drop hints, like make jokes that implies we should run away together, or we should swap husbands, or we should just move in permanently. So i feel confident that there is a strong romantic interest, but whenever I would take his joke and make it a serious ask of if we should do that, he would get visibility nervous and shut down. So we’ve kind of left it be for them to control the pace.

About 2 months ago, we all went on a group vacation together, this is something we do probably a couple times a year, and on the trip I was under the impression things had gone better than usual. Jeremi and I had progressed further in the relationship, as in some of our 1:1 dates had taken on more strongly and explicit romantic overtones than they usually do. So I was thinking this was a good sign of us starting to be able to better define the relationship, and he seemed happy until the literal last day. While we were in town, we had met a cute younger kid that seemed really into my husband and I, and he wanted to take us out to brunch. He ended up hanging out with all 4 of us the rest of the day showing us the city and took us to the airport. Jeremi seemed unusually withdrawn throughout the day, walking by himself and keeping his headphones in. When I would attempt to reach out and ask how he was doing, he would say things are fine, so i left it alone. 

When we got home from the trip, the change in tone was immediate. They both stopped speaking to us almost entirely. We would get a few small conversation bits or a few shared memes, but nothing to the same as it was before the trip. Even more so, interest in doing anything or seeing us disappeared. They would always have something going on if we asked and would not ask to try a different day, which they would usually do before this change in tone. When I asked over text if everything was okay, I was met with the answer that things are fine, they’re just busy with work. My birthday happened about 2 weeks after this trip, and while Kevin came and celebrated with us Jeremi did not, citing he was in a bad mood and wanted to be alone. Through this time I would reach out with small conversation starters or memes once or so a day to try and restart the conversation, sometimes it would work briefly, other times I’d be left on read. About a week after my birthday, I asked Jeremi if he’d be up for meeting for dinner, and he accepted this time. I was excited since we hadn’t done anything in a couple weeks and I wanted to see him. But I got extremely nervous, as right before the dinner he decided to turn off location sharing with me and my husband (we had been sharing locations for the past 2 years at their insistence, they wanted us to know where they were in case we wanted to drop in and visit).

At the dinner he gave me my birthday present, and he asked about how things have been and we had a good conversation. Towards the end of the dinner, I brought up my anxiety about the change in tone from him since the trip. Saying that he has generally been more withdrawn, less interested in talking or spending time with us, and the very recent change in location sharing, and that it has left me really anxious. I then asked him if things are going alright between us. And his answer was not positive. He brought up that during the trip, things had been more romantic than he wanted. He felt that things weren’t as he wanted, that I was being overly needy and more pushy for cuddling than he wanted and I wasn’t taking the hint. He then followed up that during the trip, he felt a strong sense of annoyance about me. He felt that I had eaten too many sweets on the trip, and he felt like I had been underdressed for a formal dinner, that I’m no longer going to school even though he’s working on his PhD (I already have a terminal degree for my field), that I haven’t been seeing a therapist (I have a history of mental illness, but have been largely managed without therapy or medication the past few years, and I didn’t even realize he even wanted me to seek therapy). He then followed up with he feels like I’m just not growing enough for him to be worthwhile as a relationship, and he felt it’s best to just leave the situation. 

I apologized that I failed to meet his needs, and I didn’t even realize that these were issues for him. I explained to him the only reason I had gone ahead with some of the more romantic actions on the trip was because I felt like he was actively encouraging them even while they were happening. He disagreed with that statement that he was encouraging it. I then followed up with a strong apology for misunderstanding his signals, that i didn’t mean to make him feel uncomfortable or pressured. That I still really care about him, and I would like to preserve the relationship. I wasn’t sure in the moment what he needed from me to make that happen, but that I want to encourage him to think on it and we could talk about it later. He said he is on the fence about if he’d even like to save the relationship, but he’d think it over. We then asked to give me a long hug, so we had a long hug, and then he left. 

I had dinner with just Kevin a few days later, and he brought up the dinner fallout up. He mentioned that he isn’t really even sure what Jeremi is angry about, but that he is clearly upset and not feeling safe right now with me. He suggested that we all just take some space and let him resettle into his feelings, he has a history of getting emotionally worked up and needing to go off by himself to calm down. He wanted to emphasize that while Jeremi is angry, he regrets some of the things he said to me at the dinner, but he needs time to settle himself before having that conversation. Kevin wanted to also emphasize that he certainly cares about us and wants to keep the relationship going, he just needs to give us space so Jeremi can have that space too. After speaking with my husband as well, he feels like that is probably a good course of action to leave them alone for now. 

Jeremi has been generally quiet for the past week, he only reached out once, Keven had a trip to the doctor for a medical procedure and I had some of their favorite food delivered to their house with a get well card, and he reached out to thank me for it and talk for a few text messages, beyond that it’s been quiet. Beyond the dinner I have also left them alone.

While I believe that leaving Jeremi alone and giving him his space is necessary for this to resolve positively, I’m an absolute wreck with anxiety right now, and I’m in a weird state of overanalyzing the situation. I’ve gone ahead and reached out to my old therapist to restart therapy and hopefully process some of my feelings. But i felt so blindsided and betrayed by this situation. I just feel so confused by it. 

I guess I just wanted to ask an outside party is: is there something I should have done differently? Are there questions I should be asking? Or is there some new way I should be looking at this? I feel like I failed them here, but I still don’t really get what happened. Can anyone help me put this in perspective?",1,1747070188.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

As someone passionate about coffee, I had high hopes when I first unboxed this sleek espresso machine. Its compact size, elegant dark blue design, and promise of convenience were undeniable selling points. But let me spill the beans—both the good and the not-so-good.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Space-saving appliances are gems in small kitchens, and this machine certainly fits that bill. At just 5.3 inches in width, it’s ideal for tight corners or minimalist spaces—like a coffee station in a studio apartment or even a hotel room. The Red Dot design award wasn’t won by accident. This espresso machine exudes charm with its smooth lines and chrome accents. Taking it out of the box for the first time felt like introducing art into my kitchen workspace. However, I couldn’t help but notice that while the outer structure looked premium, the overall feel leaned slightly towards plastic. While the build doesn’t scream ""flimsy,"" it does give off a lightness that some users might find less durable over time.  

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
Operating this espresso machine is akin to navigating a smartphone—it is so simple with its two intuitive touch controls. One button for espresso and another for lungo coffee makes it impossible to mess things up, even when you’re still half-asleep in the morning. These programmable options allow you to customize based on your preferred coffee dose. It’s worth noting that there is no brewing learning curve here! However, one limitation became clear pretty quickly: since this is a single-serve machine, it doesn’t work well for those who need to churn out multiple cups of coffee in a short amount of time. Making one cup is blissfully easy, but prepping for a group? That's a different story.

[See Lavazza LB 300 deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07rvdjw56/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The performance is where this machine shines. I’m pretty picky about the consistency and temperature of my coffee, and this little machine delivers an espresso shot that would hold its ground against the offerings from most mid-range coffee shops. The coffee is rich and balanced, thanks to the expertise of Lavazza pods paired with the machine’s efficient pressure system. However, it exclusively works with Lavazza Blue capsules, which locks you into their ecosystem. While I adore Lavazza’s selections, some may see this exclusivity as a drawback, especially given the lack of compatibility with more widely available coffee pod brands.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
A machine that is as low-maintenance as it is compact—this part impressed me! The reusable filter option makes cleanup straightforward, and even the water reservoir is easy to remove and clean. I haven’t had to wrestle with the components, which is something I’ve struggled with in other espresso machines. It’s worth mentioning that the lack of included accessories, like a milk frother or cleaning brush, would’ve been a thoughtful addition.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and award-winning ergonomic design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Easy-to-use touch controls for espresso and lungo.
- Delivers excellent espresso-quality with consistent temperature.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to Lavazza-exclusive capsules, restricting choice.  
- Plastic-heavy design might not appeal to those seeking ultra-premium build materials.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this machine with other household favorites like the Nespresso Essenza Mini shows its strengths and weaknesses. While Lavazza creates a fuller-bodied espresso, the variety of compatible pods for Nespresso offers a greater selection. Nespresso also edges out with its premium aluminum build and broader accessory suite. However, Lavazza’s machine beats Nespresso on price and operational simplicity—serious wins for casual coffee lovers or newcomers.

**Price Performance**  
When thinking about value for money, this espresso maker straddles an interesting line. Its sleek design and coffee quality justify the expense for those prioritizing these factors. However, if you’re someone who values pod variety or extra functions like milk steaming, other machines might present better bang for the buck at a similar price point.

*Hello! Welcome*

We’ve come to the end of [Before Your Memory Fades!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60224365) New cafe, new ghost, new patrons. Time travelling with a twist! 

#III - The Sister

This chapters focuses in the sisters Yukika and Reiko. *But we also gain an insight into why Yukari has gone to help the American boy find his missing father. His father hadn’t visited the cafe so the boy couldn’t time travel to see him, and Yukari felt compelled to help him search. This is something she seemingly does a lot.* Back to the sisters. Yukika was a temp barista at Donna Donna during busy periods, but she passed away a few months ago after contracting an illness that gave her not long to live. Reiko wasn’t aware of the severity of Yukika’s illness and has been struggling to come to terms with her death. She hasn’t been sleeping and has become delirious, frequently returning to the cafe to see Yukika and meet her boyfriend, forgetting that her sister has passed. One day Yukika appears in *that* seat and it causes Reiko to gain consciousness of the situation. They talk back and forth, as siblings do, and Yukika makes Reiko promise to remember to [smile when she dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYY-_RoGojw).

Yukari sends another postcard and it reveals that Yukika, in cahoots with Saki, planned to visit Reiko 3 months into the feature is she was no longer with her fiancé. Reiko is initially annoyed at Saki but forgives her because she finally feels happy again after seeing her sister one last time. 

Contrary to Saki’s pessimistic (*and bordering on straight insulting*) assurance that Reiji would flop as a comedian (^suck ^it ^Doc ), he receives an offer for a comedy gig he applied for in Tokyo. Just before he found this out though, Nanako was about to tell him something that had both their hearts going *pitter patter* in anticipation. 

#IV - The Young Man

This chapter we see Reiko return to the cafe looking a lot happier. Since her sister’s visit Reiko has reconnected with her spouse Mamoru - who wasn’t aware they’d split up - they got married at a registry office and Reiko is now moving to live with him in his home town.

We also find out the not long after Reiji received the offer and left for Tokyo, Nanako was informed of a suitable bone marrow donor and left for America. It turns out she’d been battling an illness of her own but never found the right time to tell Reiji. When she finally gained the courage to, he received the notification about the comedy gig in Tokyo and she didn’t want to dampen his spirits. 

Upon returning from Tokyo, Reiji is given a letter written by Nanako that explains her leaving and her illness. He desperately tries to figure out how to get in touch with her when the gentlemen suddenly gets up from *that* seat. Reiji makes the decision to go back to when Nanako was last in the cafe to speak with her. Before doing so he finds out Sachi finished the book *What If The World Were Ending Tomorrow? One Hundred Questions* with Nanako and this prompts Reiji to find out how Nanako answered the last question. Her answer reinforces his decision and he goes back to see her.

When Nanako arrives at the cafe she doesn’t immediately realise that Reiji has time travelled until he brings up her going to America. Throughout their conversation she seems non-chalant and this annoys Reiji because he was hoping for more of a reaction. It’s not until she asks what’s happened that he realises she was worried she didn’t survive the surgery which was why he travelled back in time to see her. They have a playful back and forth where Reiji says she proposes to him, realising that nothing he says now will change the present. Eventually she accepts what he’s saying and Reiji returns to the present. Before going back to Tokyo to pursue his dream, Reiki is gifted with Sachi’s favourite book and her reason for doing so is the most profound thing I’ve heard come from a child. Reminds me of the social posts where parents brag about the highly intelligent and often philosophical things their children *definitely* said to them.

A lot happened at the end here. It seems Yukari will likely be staying in America for a lot longer than everyone had expected, leading to them questioning if she really went to help the American boy find his father. Nanako dies from her body rejecting the transplant, but she manages to fight it for a while with the memory of Reiji exclaiming the she is his wife. Reiji goes on to win the Comedy Grand Prix after five attempts. We find out Yukari is the author of * What If The World Were Ending Tomorrow? One Hundred Questions*

I hope you enjoyed reading this book!

**Backstory:**  
We lost intimacy, and our dynamics kinda deteriorated when we started living together last June. They broke up with me in Feb and I just moved out of our shared place. We talked about going to a couples therapist back in the fall but unfortunately - I didn't realize the gravity of the situation and didn't get one in time to save things.  
  
Its a really sort of bittersweet / sad ending. We were really in love at one point but sometimes the realities of domestic live breed complacency, and I wasn't proactive enough to  save things if i'm being honest. I have a lot of regret, remorse, and deep sadness over how things turned out - I definitely thought this was the person I was meant to marry. I wasn't the assertive (non-toxically,) emotionally available, domestically capable, curious and challenging person I thought I was, and that's something i'm grappling with now in both therapy and psychiatry.   
  
I know my partner was ultimately unhappy, unsatisfied, and maybe I wonder, if there was a feeling of wasted time being with me.

**Situation:**   
I went over to return the keys the other day (ex wasn't home) and of course I went into the living room to take one last look at what was once our life.   
  
There were a pair of boots that I didn't recognize, and 2 coffees mostly finished sitting on the coffee table. When I went to the bedroom the sheets were still pretty mussed up. I think it was pretty obvious what was up.

I had this pain, this *deep* pain, knowing they've already gone onto the next person. I feel like a hypocrite because I too have gone onto the dating apps already and had a date... but even during that date I was thinking about my ex. I also have this strange feeling of emasculation (as bizarre as it sounds, so far after the fact.)

I feel like a hypocrite. I know it'll take some time to get over this massive part of my life. its just like a pain i've never known.   
  
If anyone has any tips on getting over this feeling, or if its just something we gotta go through, I appreciate it.",1,1747069988.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I have decided i want to tune my 2006 Piaggio Typhoon 50 AC to some sort of sport variant and it just gives me headaches. I really want to tune it to perfection, but it seems like that is impossible to me. Changed most the things that was broken, but it doesn't perform well still. 

My Setup:   
DR Evo 70cc BBK (not-ported)  
Technigas Next-R (w/o restrictor)  
Dellorto PHVA 17.5 Carb w 98 MJ and stock PJ (probably 32) , Needle set at leanest position  
Stock airbox with Malossi air filter  
Stock crank (gonna change it when i get my money)  
Naraku Performance needle bearing

5.5g rollers, stock clutch, vario, and all the springs

On 1/4 gas it accelerates well, but past that it feels like it's struggling. After 1/2 gas to WOT it's just hesitates and rumbles, which feels like a rich bog to me, like hitting a rev limiter. Checked the spark color with a 92 and 98 MJ and it was light coffee brown. I'm using the oil pump with a little oil added to the fuel, but i was thinking i need to switch to full premix.

A friend of mine have suggested that i need a bigger carb, like a 19 or 21mm and an another one that i need to throw the Technigas exhaust in the trash.

Can you guys had/have similar problems with tuning or is it just me who doesn't know how to do this tuning?

1kky1gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Happy_Web1085/comments/1kky1gw/frequently_asked_questions_about_cold_process/,Frequently Asked Questions About Cold Process Soap-Making,"Cold process soap-making is both an **art and a science**, blending natural oils, lye, and creative additives into a bar that cleanses while nourishing the skin. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced soap-maker, understanding key aspects of the process is essential for success. Here’s an extensive guide addressing the most common questions.

# 1. What is Cold Process Soap-Making?

Cold process soap-making involves mixing **oils, butters, and lye** without external heat (aside from the natural heat of the reaction). This method allows **full control over ingredients**, producing a **gentler, longer-lasting bar** compared to commercial soaps.

# 2. How Does Saponification Work?

Saponification is the **chemical reaction between lye and oils**, transforming liquid ingredients into solid soap and natural glycerin. The glycerin provides **moisturizing properties**, making cold process soap **rich and nourishing** compared to detergent-based soaps.

# 3. Is Lye Dangerous to Work With?

Lye (**sodium hydroxide**) is **caustic and must be handled with care**, but it’s essential for soap-making. Proper precautions include:

* Wearing **gloves and eye protection**
* Mixing lye **in a well-ventilated area**
* Using **non-reactive containers** (stainless steel or plastic, never aluminum)
* Adding lye to **distilled water slowly**, never the other way around

Once saponification occurs, no lye remains in the final soap—it has completely reacted with oils.

# 4. What Ingredients Are Best for Cold Process Soap?

The choice of oils affects the soap’s **lather, hardness, and moisturizing qualities**. Common oils include:

* **Coconut Oil** – Provides a **creamy lather** and cleansing properties.
* **Olive Oil** – Adds **gentleness and moisture** but makes a softer bar.
* **Shea Butter** – Creates **richness and conditioning** benefits.
* **Castor Oil** – Enhances **lather and silkiness** in soap.
* **Palm Oil (Sustainably Sourced)** – Improves **firmness and longevity**.

Each oil plays a role, so balancing them ensures the perfect texture and effectiveness.

# 5. What’s the Right Lye-to-Oil Ratio?

Soap recipes require **precise measurements** to ensure full saponification. A typical ratio might be:

* **Oils: 100%**
* **Lye: Around 5-7% of total oils**
* **Water: 2 times the amount of lye**

A **lye calculator** (such as SoapCalc or BrambleBerry’s tool) helps adjust the ratio for custom formulations.

# 6. Why Do Some Soaps Feel Drying?

A soap can feel drying due to:

* **Too much coconut oil**, which is highly cleansing but strips excess oils.
* **Not enough superfat**, which is the extra oils left after saponification to keep soap **moisturizing**.
* **Hard water**, which interacts with soap and reduces its effectiveness.

A **5-8% superfat** helps keep soap **gentle and nourishing**.

# 7. What’s the Best Way to Add Scents and Colors?

Essential oils and natural colorants enhance soap creatively:

* **Essential Oils** – Lavender, peppermint, tea tree, and citrus oils provide fragrance and skin benefits.
* **Clays and Herbs** – Bentonite clay, spirulina, and activated charcoal add color while improving texture.
* **Natural Infusions** – Turmeric, coffee, and alkanet root create rich hues without artificial additives.

Synthetic fragrances work, but **natural options are better for sensitive skin**.

# 8. How Long Does Cold Process Soap Take to Cure?

Cold process soap requires a **4 to 6-week curing period**, allowing water to evaporate and improving hardness. Faster curing methods don’t fully develop a **long-lasting bar**, so patience is key.

# 9. Why Did My Soap Turn White or Ashy on Top?

This **soda ash** is harmless and forms due to **exposure to air during curing**. To prevent it:

* Spray the soap surface with **99% isopropyl alcohol** after pouring.
* Cover with plastic wrap or a lid for the first 24 hours.
* Store soap in a low-humidity environment while it cures.

Soda ash doesn’t affect the final product and can be wiped off with a damp cloth.

# 10. What Causes Soap to Overheat or Crack?

Soap can **overheat or crack** due to:

* **High temperatures** when blending oils and lye.
* **Too much insulation**—using towels or blankets when it’s unnecessary.
* **Honey or milk additives**, which accelerate the heat reaction.

To prevent overheating, soap should be placed in a **cool, stable environment** and monitored closely.

# 11. How Can I Make My Soap Harder and Longer-Lasting?

To improve hardness:

* Use oils like **cocoa butter, tallow, or palm oil**.
* Increase the curing time—longer cure means firmer bars.
* Store soaps in a **dry place** to prevent softening.
* Reduce superfat slightly for a **firmer texture**.

A well-balanced recipe ensures durability while remaining **gentle on the skin**.

# 12. Can I Make Soap Without Lye?

No—**true soap requires lye** to create saponification. However, **melt-and-pour soap** is an alternative where the lye process is already completed, allowing easy customization.

# 13. What’s the Difference Between Cold and Hot Process Soap?

Cold process soap cures naturally over weeks, while hot process uses **external heat** (like a slow cooker) to speed up saponification. Cold process allows **greater artistic swirls** and smoother bars.

# 14. What Are Common Mistakes in Soap-Making?

Beginners often run into:

* **Inaccurate measurements**—Always use a **lye calculator**.
* **Overheating oils**—Keep temperatures controlled for better consistency.
* **Not insulating properly**—Some recipes require insulation, others don’t.
* **Skipping cure time**—Soap needs weeks to **fully harden and develop**.
* **Adding scents or colors too soon**—Essential oils and additives should be blended at **light trace** for best results.

# Final Thoughts: Mastering Cold Process Soap

Cold process soap-making is a rewarding craft that combines chemistry with creativity. From selecting the right oils to troubleshooting common issues, each step helps refine your technique and produce **high-quality, luxurious bars**.

Understanding the nuances of ingredients, formulation, and curing ensures that **your soap is not only effective but beautiful and nourishing**. Whether you're making soap for personal use or selling your creations, mastering these FAQs will set you up for success.

A 28 y/o Engineer by chance - consultant by choice - Rajasthani guy, with a heart full of love for life, laughter, and adventure. And in last few years,  I've learned to expect the unexpected and laugh at life's absurdities. 

I'll keep it detailed so, be paitant enough with me (one of the qualities I will always cherish in my companion). 
I'm looking for a partner in crime who can appreciate the beauty in life's imperfections, full of spirit who aspires to make it a fun escapade and is willing to experiment and dab into all kinds of experiences. It doesn't necessarily have to be sexual nor kinky. I am looking  to live a little more through other peoples' perspectives, perceptions and preferences as well.      

As Phil Dunphy says, ""Dreamers need realists to keep their feet on the ground, and realists need dreamers to lift their feet off the ground.""

If you're a realist with a heart of gold, a love for adventure, and a passion for making a difference, let's get this dream team started!

""We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."" I'm looking for someone who will gaze at the stars with me, hold my hand through life's ups and downs, and maybe even share a laugh or two about our pup's antics.

Here is the deal : A short period contract (about 3 months is what I am thinking and can extend if you want to). Both clearly state what we want. Doesn't have to be all sexual. No judgements. No complaints. No rona dhona. You ask.. You get it types. I don't have to like it. It goes both ways.. I express and making it happen is your decision. I am not primarily looking for sexual experiences right now, it's always great to include it though. Show me what's your ideal romance is like may be? I'll be there and hear you out. We create eachother's ideal dates? The other person doesn't have to like it but we make it happen for eachother. I am looking to learn and experience perspectives. Some laughs and some mistakes and some silliness. A light-hearted escapade away from this world. A fun adventure. The tailored experiences to exactly match our dreamy imagination.

• I would love to have some sort of relationship where we can talk about random stuff/ explore the city. Not necessarily calling it a relationship. (Preferred something unnamed unless both are sured).
• To create a non judgemental space where we can be our weird selves. Unbiased and shamelessly.

Very long time lurker here, and finally ready to start work on my query.

I'll start by saying I can already spot some of the areas where I'm lacking specificity (think: editorial description vs. actual plot specifics), but I'd really like to get some guidance before I work on my next version.

\------------

**QUERY:**

Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

I’m seeking representation for my debut novel, EVERY LETTER IN THE ALPHABET, a literary novel complete at 75,000 words. With a stream-of-consciousness style and a deeply troubled unreliable narrator at its core, it will appeal to readers of Raven Leilani’s *Luster* and Megan Nolan’s *Acts of Desperation*, as well as fans of the satirical, self-loathing introspection found in Ottessa Moshfegh’s work.

Five years after her twin sister’s kidnapping, Ana is still ugly, unhappy and bored. She works at a restaurant with her former best friend Elías, who’s also Luci’s ex. At home, Ana is witness to her mother’s declining mental state as she spends her days glued to the TV, waiting for news of Luci’s safe return.

But Ana is drowning in guilt. Despite her rocky relationship with Luci, she was with her the night she disappeared and has made this her secret. Now she’s desperate to feel something, to pretend she can, so she joins a local acting class preparing for a monologue show. If she can learn to fake her happiness, to act out a whole life, perhaps she can fool herself and everyone else.

As Ana discovers the ugly truths of Luci’s own performative life—the men she knew and how she weaponized herself to use them—lines get blurred as Ana’s sense of self collapses.

Set against the backdrop of a violent Mexico City, EVERY LETTER IN THE ALPHABET explores guilt through queerness, feminism, and gender dysphoria in a machista culture.

I am a queer Mexican filmmaker with a background in documentary filmmaking. My short documentary \[TITLE\] has been nominated and screened at several international film festivals.

Thank you for considering my work.

\-----------------

**FIRST 300:**

I work at a small restaurant on Hidalgo Avenue, just a few blocks east from Downtown Coyoacán. It’s not quite a restaurant, but a restaurant-coffee-shop hybrid. Call it an eatery or whatever suits the day and its customers’ needs. Today, this is a fat man and his fat woman who have seated themselves at the smallest table, which is by the large dining room window that faces what used to be a driveway but is now, mainly, empty space. This is our busiest table because it’s central, it’s the one with the better lighting and this woman seems to know this, steady with her lipstick as she finds her face pressed into a tiny mirror she’s drawn from her purse. Her lips are pink like coral, plump and glossy like gummy teeth candy.

Elías taps my arm. He hands me two menus and this is my sign to stop prying. *Go on, don’t be weird*, he says. I step down the steps from the kitchen, which is technically part of the dining room, barely its own room behind a half-wall and two columns I often use to hide. I walk to the table and I smile, I hold out the menus one at a time but the man is desperate enough to pull his off my hands. *Thanks, darling,* he says. I want to tell him I’m no darling but I can’t afford petty interactions. Instead I smile a bigger smile and the woman smiles too.

*Can I get your drinks?* I ask.

The man says *I’ll have coffee* and I nod. I say *of course.* Coffee is on the house but he doesn’t know this so I’ll charge him for it. The woman claws into her purse, pulls out a kiss-stained napkin she folds and bites gently with her lips. She sets it aside, as if handing it to me, expecting me to pick up her crusty, worn out thing. Then she fixes herself up and smacks her lips in the mirror. I reckon she looks like a cheap blow-up doll.

Ich bin ein Filmregisseur aus den USA und ziehe im September nach Deutschland – wahrscheinlich nach Berlin oder Köln. Mein Deutsch ist noch nicht perfekt (A2/B1), aber ich lerne fleißig und freue mich darauf, mich beruflich und kulturell einzuleben.

I’m planning to apply for either the freelance work visa or the artist visa, and part of that means lining up a few potential clients or collaborators ahead of time.

My background is mostly in narrative film and branded content. I’ve directed several projects, including a $400K feature that’s currently waiting on distribution. I also have an MFA in Screenwriting from the University of Georgia, and I’ve worked across development, production, and post. I’m especially strong when it comes to directing actors and working on lean, efficient productions.

I’d love to connect with anyone in the German film/TV/commercial world—producers, creatives, agencies, crews, whoever. I’m open to:

* Directing work (film, TV, branded/commercial content)
* Shadowing/directing assistant opportunities to learn the local industry
* Collaborations on new projects or agency campaigns
* Just meeting people in the creative scene here!

I speak French and I’m learning German. Very open to working in either language environment and building long-term collaborations.

If you’re working on something and want a director, or just feel like chatting over coffee when I land, feel free to reach out!

The capital cities of midrealm are connected through the magical gates of the pentarch to the tower of Omnus. Any person can pay a silver to walk from one capital to another. This allows trade and travel between far points of the kingdoms. It allows the military might of omnus to be quickly placed for defense of law and order. The placing of the pentarch in the capitals brings wealth and prestige to a city, but also makes it responsible for its area as well as the management of other tribute cities, in manner of law keeping and taxation. The position of which cities tithe to which capitals was created among great political machinations. Each region must establish a government to operate under the high kings approval and careful watch. 


Kaldur: The most ancient capital. Located on the southern shore of a peninsula reaching out to the western Ocean kaldur marks where the ocean crashed upon the ten thousand isles. It's mountainous cliffs of Grey stone has stood for thousands of years. It's colors of gold and purple were chosen as it is the favorite of Abbadon. It's flag a golden sunset upon purple seas. Known for its docks and boat builders, as well as the bounties of the seas. It's tithe cities are Boden, Corvos, Taltos, Venica and Dinavore. These cities known as the shorelands, are beholden to Kaldur. 


Where the panninsula meets the land there is a river that leads to the sail hand lake, this is where Boden was built. On the western side of the mint hills and south of the Midridges within the great forest, Boden flag is a silver lance wrapped purple flower ivy. Known for its mines of salt tin quartz and timber Bodens colors are purple and silver.


South of kaldur overlooking the tiny dots of the ten thousand isles is a gentle hill halfway between the shore of the west ocean and the great platinum lake, lies Taltos. On the edge of the great forest Taltos is known for its fruit, rice, whiskey and wine. It's temperate climate and wetlands make good farming. It's access to the platinum lake allow for the refining of sand to gather platinum. It's flag is the purple trout with white and rainbow spots. Once a year the rainbow trout climb up the many outlets of the platinum lake to feed in its waters before going up the Argent river to spawn. The fish is a Taltos delicacy.


On the innermost corner of the great platinum lake where the Argent river feeds in, lies the city of Corvos. Its flag is the purple trout jumping over black rocks upstream.Known for its access to platinum, spices and fruit from the west and southern plains, as well as its delicacy, purple trout caviar. Once a year the great purple trout swim upstream to pools in the argent river and spawn before dying. The fish that don't survive the journey are filled with the delicious fish row used in Corvos dishes. The rivalry between Corvos and Taltos is considered to be one of the best known in midrealm. If the fishermen in Taltos take too many fish from the lake during the run, there is less caviar for Corvos. If the caviar is harvested too much in Corvos, less trout can be caught in the following years.


Located deep within the great forest between the Mint hills and the Berry hills, lies Dinavore on the Argent river. It's flag a great green tree wrapped in purple flower ivy. Known for its timber of ancient trees, as well as it's stone and love of wild Boar. It's access to the rushing waters of the argent river allow water wheels to run great mills where the granite of the area is cut and polished. It's flat land forests are known for their excellent game and quiet life among the shade of ancient trees.


Venica is the most southern port in all of midrealm. It's flag a deep red Venican rose with purple leaves. Often considered the door to the ten thousand isles, it is known for its seafood and warm waters. An ancient city of art and music so great it is named in a thousand songs. It's existence among the encroaching waters is an act of will. It's passionate people known for their love of food and culture. It's people are known for seafaring and cunning. It's families are known for tradition and past glories. This beautiful and vibrant perception is the veneer over top many sad truths. Venica is also known for its impoverished lower caste as well as it's nefarious and seemingly all present crime. A vision of opera houses, fine craft halls, and museums are only a few minutes walk from the floating warrens of destitute people. It's great boulevards lined with restaurants and pleasure houses, and each twisted alley leading away from the main bridges is filled with sick, hungry, and addicted people. Below the city is older buildings that have sunk into the silt of the river delta. Tunnels meant for drainage, and abandoned canals built over with new. It is said many destitute people, left behind by the aristocracy, love here in squalor.

Orren is the capital of the Southlands. It's flag a white horse in an orange sunrise. The newest city of the capitals it is filled with ongoing construction. It's design a twisted maze of high walls cradling the city within like a maze. High bridges cross from ward to ward. Great empty spaces within the walls maze are used to graze livestock, and confuse would be invaders. Many of the homes and shops are built within these great curving walls adding security to the capital. Orren is k own for its horses, livestock, grain, and marble. It's populace is as varied as Midrealm itself. With dwarves and gnomes working with half giant, humans and elves to craft great works. The farthest south of any capital, it's hot climate draws visitors from everywhere. Centered in the great southern plains, it is a great place to ride horses, and train military formations. 


On the edge of the southern planes, on the Goldhills leading to Block rim, lies Sanvar. Many prospectors have.come to sanvar to search for their fortunes mining the gold in the harsh hot rocky environment. It's culture imbued with the wandering tribes of the silver sands dessert to the south, sanvar has an exotic quality of life. The trade with the dessert folk, as well as venica to the northwest, and orren far to it's east, it has access to many markets. The ability to mine it's gold brings a steady trickle of merchants, and adventurous people eying trade and a better life. It's flag is oranges on a golden scale. It is known for its coffee, and exotic animals, as much as it's markets and gold.


The farthest southern city is Talmore. A mere days travel from the silver sands dessert and far to the south east of Orren on the eastern most plains. Originally a military outpost and hold to fend off attacks of orcs and goblins from the south and east, talmore has been hardened to a fortress. The Builder corps of Midrealm was created with the task of securing this border. A great wall has been constructed from the Mike high cliffs of Eastwall reaching south to Talmore to harden the kingdoms from invasion. From Kobolds to fire giants and even Blue Dragons, the wall has been attacked, and defended and rebuilt many times. Talmore has become a symbol of strength and refuge to any peaceful party escaping the tyranny of outside forces. While originally known for its ability to grow abundant grains fruits, and herds of cattle, Talmore has since become home to many Gnomes who have hardened the defenses of Talmore with great alchemical cannons.

Following the great wall road north from the eastern plains lies the source of their stone. Dithmal was originally a place for criminals to work of their debt, and thrive building security for all of Midrealm through service, and labor. Now a thriving city in its own right Dithmal is home to families of craftsmem, and home to the Builders corps. It's placement on the immense cliffs of Eastwall make it a perfect place to mine iron, coal, and the granite for the wall. It's flag is an orange flame in a lantern in a cave. 


Where the upper plains meet the great forest, and the cliff of Eastwall, lies Valens forge. It's flag an orange sheild struck by a silver hammer. During the chaos known as the fall, a dwarf named Valen lived as a wanderer and sinner. Living a life witnessing the fall had caused him to focus on survival over righteousness. After stealing and begging his way south to survive he decided to give up his love of liquor and selfish needs to live honestly among the trials and tribulations that had wrecked society around him. He found an old mine and made his home there. Using the metals he had found within to forge weapons of defense, and a place of humble saftey. He found other survivors and cared for them in his way, as they worked to expand the mine. Over the centuries of his life that followed, Valen had rescued and protected a large population of people. Working to preserve their histories and lineage 
Through the apocalypse that had befallen the lands. Eventually gathering a library of holy scripture and relics, he became a cleric of the dwarves. He welcomed all faiths to his sanctuary. Thus valens forge turned from a mine camp to the great city that still stands. It's position as a city in tithe to Orren and not Deep-under is a political statement that Valens forge belongs to everyone and not just to the dwarves that are it's main inhabitants. It's crafthalls remain some of the best in the world and its libraries of holy scripture remain second to none.",1,1747069433.0,Tetsudinarc,0,1.0,False

I felt like I tortured myself doing that. I felt like I couldn’t breathe I wanted to go home so bad after like 5 days of being there but he seemed so into me and I didn’t know why. I barely even touched him, we never kissed. He treated me well (other than a couple red flags) and I don’t even think I pulled my wallet out once the entire time and he cooked for me every night and took me on very nice dates …. Finally when I got to go home I couldn’t wait to get away from him. I thought I was being obvious with my body language and just … showing barely any interest the entire 2 weeks. I don’t know it was such a bizarre experience and situation . He dropped me off at the airport and said to call him when I got home. As soon as I got back into my city it’s like my body froze and a trauma response kicked in and the thought of having to call him or keep in contact was overwhelmingly making me feel sick. I had the ick so bad for no apparent reason I’m still confused as to why because he did nothing wrong. I called him when I landed and then I never spoke to him again. I completely went ghost. He sent me so many messages and was so confused and I just couldn’t bring myself to respond. I still had him on my IG and he would watch my stories and then finally after a month I responded to one of his texts and said I was sorry it took me so long to respond but I just don’t think a relationship is what I want right now and he begged me to call him and I said I would later that day and then just never did . He recently sent me a message again saying him and his dog missed me and were still waiting for that call …. And I just left him on read and I think he has finally taken the hint.   I do feel bad for how I handled things but it’s too late now to dwell on it … it is what it is.   I have an avoidant attachment style that I’ve been to therapy for and I thought I had healed myself enough but he really triggered something in me that caused me to completely shut down. I would say he had anxious attachment style tendencies and those were the red flags I was noticing. He was a well put together , very handsome , very successful guy but for example one of the first few nights I was there he took me to this brewery and we were having a drink there before our dinner reservation somewhere else…. They had a jar of dog treats on the bar for people who had animals on the patio obviously and as we were leaving after he paid the bill …. He grabbed a dog treat and then came up behind me and grabbed my head and pulled my head back and started SHOVING THE DOG TREAT IN MY MOUTH FORCEFULLY….. I was stunned and he was laughing hysterically thinking it was a funny joke but I did not think it was funny. It really put me off. I brushed it off but it stuck with me the whole 2 weeks .   Also I’m a creative entrepreneur and I’m a night owl to the very end and he had me on his strict schedule (he owns a winery and owned a clothing brand in Australia so he doesn’t actually work he’s basically retired) so we had to go to bed every night by 7-8pm (I’m 34 and he’s 48) and I felt like a child being put to bed for bedtime every night and then we would get up every morning at 6am on the dot… make a coffee, watch the news (I hate watching the news) from 6-630 . Then we would take his dog for the same walk everyday around his neighborhood….then we would go down to the gym and workout from 9-10am and then have breakfast from 10-11 . And then we would run errands or do activities and then a date or whatever ….  I felt like I was living fucking Groundhog Day every single day I was losing my fucking mind it felt so depressing. I remember we went to a concert one night and we’re out late and I was so hungover the next day and I just wanted to sit and relax and order food and he like wouldn’t let me relax …. He forced me to take the dog for a walk with him …. He forced me to go for a long drive to pickup food …. It’s like I had to be next to him and with him 24/7 and it felt so suffocating … he couldn’t do anything alone ! I need my space and alone time to recharge . He drove me fucking insane and it came off controlling to me .   Then one of the last nights he was there he told me he had a domestic violence charge on his record from the states and needed a pardon to go there from a “drunk incident” with his ex wife when they were married and on a trip in California but downplayed it and trivialized it and showed me a legal letter his wife wrote in his defence because it was apparently “just a drunk argument” (he was caught on camera “pulling her back” into their hotel room when she was trying to get away from him.   He also drank a lot . Other than those things he was a total gentleman the whole time but I don’t know ….. maybe after writing all this out I actually don’t regret ghosting him. I think my gut was screaming at me there’s something off about this guy and I’m glad I dodged that bullet.

I've been very sad lately. I got laid off from my job last summer and have been jumping from one temporary contract to another since then. These contracts typically last around 3 months, so I have to keep looking for work and never get a break from it all.

Nothing is stable, and I can't plan my life when my job situation is like this (I'm looking for permanent roles or longer contracts, but the market is awful). I love travelling more than anything, but can't plan any trips. I developed feelings for my best friend last year and found out that he felt the same way, but he got laid off as well and doesn't want a relationship until he gets a stable job. I can't look at new apartments to rent because someone with an unstable income isn't attractive to landlords.

I lost a huge amount of weight over the past couple of years and worry about gaining some of the weight back. I just feel so low a lot of the time due to my world turning upside down, and it's hard to get motivated to go to the gym. I go around twice a week instead of 5 times (like I used to). I'm also not eating so well these days compared to before. I used to drink alcohol once a week, but now it's around 3 times a week. I never used to drink coffee, but now I drink it a few days a week.

1kkxjg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1kkxjg7/coffee_culture_in_the_us/,Coffee Culture in the U.S.,"I really hope this thread doesn’t get much heat and actually leads to a better analysis of American coffee culture.

I grew up in Europe and started working in coffee shops from a very young age, like most Europeans (specifically Southern Europeans) do in their early 20s. For me, it was just an easy way to balance my studies with work, since I could go to school during the day and work at a coffee shop in the evening. And yes, coffee shops in European countries are open after 3:00 p.m. unlike in the States.

I have a lot of family across the U.S. and I visited quite often throughout my life, so I wasn’t clueless about the coffee culture here before I permanently moved here.  


That being said, I started working as a barista again over the past year because I wanted to learn more about how the coffee industry works in this part of the world as I’m thinking of starting my own business. I knew before I got into this that coffee here is way more complex and has many things done completely differently from how I was taught, but I didn’t mind learning everything from scratch again.

But there’s one thing that stood out to me the most (besides the unlimited options of flavors, milks, etc. someone can order) and that’s the people who work in coffee shops. I’ve never in my life worked in an environment with such a specific group of people, and I’ve worked as a barista in three different E.U. countries and five different cities.

There’s a particular background, ideology, and way of thinking among people who work in coffee shops here. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it is defiantly something that stood out to me. Most baristas I’ve met seem to come from similar social circles, often with degrees in arts, design, or just self proclaim as art enthusiast. There’s an unspoken aesthetic code too with the tattoos, the thrifted clothes, ever changing hair colors or randomly shaved eyebrows, and so on.

Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with all of this, but when 99% of the people you work with are like that, it starts to feel a bit like a cult or something.

What’s more surprising is the shared set of values. There’s a strong emphasis on things like labor rights, sustainability, and identity politics. These topics often come up casually during shifts almost as if they're part of the job description. But sometimes it feels like people repeat things they've heard without digging too deep into them.

For example, one time someone walked into the coffee shop wearing a Trump hat. One of the baristas immediately commented that they didn’t like that. I agreed with her, but I also mentioned that I think people should keep their beliefs to themselves. I find it just as ridiculous as someone wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, like they want everyone to know what they stand for. She looked at me confused and asked, “Who’s Che Guevara?”

That just made me think that this whole industry might be a cult, not because she didn’t know, but because it showed me how much of the conversation around politics and values can be more about signaling than substance. 

Then there this romanticized idea of Europe that comes up constantly, almost like a “grass is greener over there” mentality. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve been asked, “Is cappuccino better in Europe? I’ve heard that even people with lactose intolerance can drink regular cappuccinos over there.” Or, “Is it true baristas in Italy don’t even drink lattes?” 

Yet, at the same time, they’ll make fun of me for taking espresso shots right before my shift as they think its disgusting.

I completely understand that American culture is very different from what I’m used to and the way I grew up. But when 99% of the people you work with think and behave in such a specific way (so far removed from American culture) it starts to feel like a cult. I’ve worked other jobs in the States, but I’ve never experienced an environment quite like this one. It’s almost as if there’s a set of unwritten rules everyone follows, and if you don’t fit in, you’re on the outside. People are so ingrained in their own way of thinking, it feels more like a community with shared rituals than a workplace. It’s a strange contrast to the more diverse, flexible environments I’ve worked in before.

1kkxiy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1kkxiy7/my_sutab_prep_experience/,My Sutab Prep Experience,"Hi again!

I posted in here yesterday about being very nervous for the sutab (pill) prep and procedure after reading dozens of posts on this sub. Now that its finished I wanted to add my experience for anyone who is nervous about their pill prep in the future.

My colonscopy was at 9am Monday. Starting Sunday I began to eat a light, no fiber diet. My food consisted of a turkey patty with cheese, a couple eggs, some mashed potatoes (no skins) and pudding. 

I started my clear liquid diet on Sunday, which included water, black coffee, apple juice, Gatorade, electrolyte drinks, jello and some jolly ranchers. My first prep began at 5pm. 

I was very worried about not being able to swallow the pills and them making me nauseous. Personally I did not find them difficult to swallow (and I struggle with large pills) but I did need a bit more water than a sip to get them down. I took 1 every 4 minutes, then upped it to 1 every 3 minutes since I was feeling good and I wanted to get it over with. 

Luckily there wasn't much in me by the time they prep kicked in. It started very fast, about 20 minutes after I took the last pill. It finally started slowing down about 3 hours later (enough for me to go lay down between bathroom visits), but I was in and out of the bathroom until 11pm. I had some very very mild nausea about 30 minutes after completing the prep and it passed quickly. I had no other symptoms. 

This is where I messed up. I only slept like 45 minutes. My next prep was scheduled to start at 2 but I wanted to start it closer to 1 since the first one went so long. So I set an alarm, let myself wake up and drink water for 10 minutes before starting the 2nd dose. I was so groggy and already did not feel great. Took the 2nd round of pills 3 minutes apart. Things started about 10 minutes after finishing the last pill. I will say I had a lot more nausea this round, accompanied by trembling and hot flashes, but it went away within about 5 minutes! The no sleep - no food - drinking way too much water combo got to me. If I ever redo the experience, I recommend taking the 2nd round of pills 5 minutes apart. 

2nd round only lasted about 2 hours and I just chilled until we had to drive to the hospital. the procedure itself was super easy, my doctor told me to prepare for the best nap of my life and she was right. I woke up to her telling me I look completely healthy and finally got to eat my pancakes!",1,1747068746.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

Need to brew morning coffee. It’s one of those big commercial coffee machines where you have the water spout and coffee filter up top screwed into the machine, and the actual carafe is below - the finished coffee drops through the air into the carafe. Take a moment and see if you can picture it. I’ve used machines like this before, but those were at different places so the routine isn’t locked in yet - the memory hasn’t transferred over.

Now, the lid is on the carafe. I look at it. There’s a VERY small hole (in hindsight, probably for air filtration?) - but it’s not even positioned in the right place to receive the coffee, even if it was large enough. “I wonder how the coffee is going to end up in the carafe, with a lid over?” I wonder. I shrug, and start brewing the coffee. It goes everywhere, and only 20 min later during cleanup I realize what happened.

I mean, I know I’m absentminded. I know I’m forgetful and generally not very present. But at what point is “wired differently” no longer an excuse? At this point, it’s just a matter of not using my brain - as adults have said to me all my life. It’s not “connecting the dots.” A lack of “common sense,” even.

Last year we decided to stop using plastic cutting boards and reduced down to just the wood ones we had (one small, two large). We’ve struggled along since to keep up with them so this weekend I finally cut up the off cut in to a set of small, medium, large.

Ironically, I kept the plastic cutting boards to use as tooling such as holding wood boards while its conditioner sets.

This was my first time resawing with the table saw and first time using a router table. Definitely made some mistakes but learned a lot! Like how badly I want a band saw…",1,1747068630.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False
1kkxh2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kkxh2c/the_door_that_wasnt_there_yesterday/,The Door That Wasn't There Yesterday,"Eliot lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment. Everything was routine—wake up, coffee, emails, TV, sleep. Same layout, same cracked tile in the kitchen, same creaky hallway floorboard near the bedroom.

One morning, as he stepped out of the bathroom, towel around his neck, he saw it.

A door.

On the wall opposite his bedroom. Matte black, perfectly smooth. No knob, no hinges. Just there.

He stood frozen. It hadn’t been there yesterday. He was sure.

He touched it. Cold. Almost vibrating.

When he turned around to grab his phone, the door was gone.

A trick of the light, he told himself. Sleep deprivation. Easy.

But it came back the next day. And the next. Sometimes open just a crack. Once, he swore he saw his own hand reach out from inside it.

No matter how hard he tried, he could never catch it opening. Or closing. It just… was.

Eventually, he stopped sleeping. He set up cameras. None ever caught the door.

He started hearing whispers. Muffled. Not from the door—but in his head, when he looked at the door.

He broke down one night and painted over it.

The paint peeled off by morning.


---

Then one day, Eliot saw something that shattered him.

He was on a video call with his sister. She laughed mid-conversation and said, “Is that a closet? Didn’t know you had one there.”

He turned to look behind him.

The door.

WIDE open.

Dark inside. Endless.

He turned back to the screen.

He was gone. The video still ran. His room was visible. But no Eliot. No motion. Just the door.

Open.

On the video, someone else stepped into frame. Same room. Same clothes. Same face.

But it wasn’t him.

It stared into the camera and smiled.


---

Eliot woke up in darkness. No walls. No sound. No light. Only the door in front of him—closed now.

And voices… whispering his name over and over.

He banged on the door. Screamed. No answer.

On the other side, the thing wearing his skin made coffee. Answered emails. Laughed with his sister. It lived his life better than he ever did.

And every now and then, it paused by the wall.

And listened.

To the muffled screams behind the door that wasn’t there yesterday.",22,1747068623.0,shortscarystories,2,0.96,False

Help me Get Through It?,"Title, really. I'm very discerning about people. I don't get close with people often, and take a long time to warm up to them. However, when I met 27M it was pretty instantaneous - we have the same sense of humor, the same music taste, the same analytical and contemplative way of thinking. We're both queer, go to the same bars and coffee shops, listen to the same podcasts, have the same love of learning. When we first met, it felt like I was reconnecting with an old friend. Later on, he'd say he'd felt the same way.

For about 6 or 7 weeks we tried dating and then agreed to be friends; for him it was my vulnerability issues, for me it was his judgmental tendencies. We both have some attachment issues, and if I'm being honest becoming friends was a relief at first. But of course, over time, our walls came down and I realized I was falling in love with him. I've only known him for about 3 months, yet I feel like I've known him my whole life. I've only felt this way once before, for my first love at 21.

I thought he might be feeling the same way; a couple of weeks ago (the night I realized I was falling in love with him), we went to our favorite dive bar together, smoking cigarettes, drinking whiskey, and playing pool. He commented on how good I looked and talked nostalgically about our sex life. We laughed so hard we were doubled over. Talked for hours. At one point I caught him looking at me with a large smile and he shook his head. I asked why and he said, ""I'm just really content right now."" When we walked into the parking lot he threw me over his shoulder and spun me around. It sounds stupid but it's the happiest I've been in a long time.

Last week I broached the subject and he said that while he had feelings for me, he didn't think this would work romantically and hadn't changed his mind. He wanted to stay friends. I wanted to stay friends. But as he talked about meeting someone new that week, it took everything inside of me to feign support and encouragement. I found myself getting irritable and sad. That night I laid in bed staring at the ceiling sleeplessly as I contemplated the inevitably of how this would go - he would find someone new, I would watch him slowly fall in love with that person, and I would have to cloister my unrequited feelings away deeper and deeper inside of myself. Our friendship would likely become more distant and infrequent. I would be comparing everyone I tried to date to him.

The next day I sent a text explaining that I didn't think we could be friends, at least right now - that if I stayed I would fall in love with him, and that I was harboring an unfair resentment that he decided I wasn't ""worth the work"" of trying to be in a relationship with me. I told him how highly I thought of him and wished him the best. After several hours he responded with, ""Okay. I wish it could've been different. You're worth a lot more than just work, I hope you find it."" It sounds stupid but the moment I cried was when I realized he stopped following my Spotify playlist. We bonded over music a lot.

Anyway. As stupid as it sounds, this is hitting me harder than my last breakup. It's like he's running in the background of my mind all the time. It's only been a few days and I already miss him. Because we have so much overlap in favorite places and music and food, everything reminds me of him. Before ending things I'd gone back and forth about getting him flowers for his graduation coming up because I didn't want it misconstrued as a romantic gesture, or him feeling disappointed that the first time he got flowers, they would be from me. He wanted flowers but said he didn't want ""pity flowers."" I think about it every time I walk past the bouquets in the grocery store. I thought it would go away eventually, but instead it just changed from ""Should I buy him flowers? Would that be weird? I'd buy my other friends flowers"" to ""I never bought him flowers, I never bought him flowers, I never bought him flowers.""

I'm just....so sad. Please advise.",1,1747068402.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1kkxdao,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1kkxdao/is_it_socially_acceptable_to_sit_in_a_coffee_shop/,Is it socially acceptable to sit in a coffee shop and not buy anything?,"For some context I’m still in school and my family life is really difficult. My parents are toxic and sometimes abusive so home is not a safe or peaceful place for me.

Most days I leave the house really early, around 6 AM, and try not to come back until it’s late, just to avoid conflict. The problem is that my school doesn’t open until 8:30 AM, and there aren’t any breakfast clubs or morning activities I can go to. 

Libraries nearby also don’t open until 9.

Normally I’ve been going to parks or walking around, but the area I live in isn’t very safe, especially for young girls. Recently, I had a scary encounter with a man that’s made me really anxious about being outside alone.

Coffee shops seem like the only safe place to go, but since my family struggles financially, I can’t afford to buy a drink every day just to sit there. I know some people might say I should just stay at home, but that’s not an option for me right now because my mental health really can’t handle it.

I js wanted to know if places  like Starbucks, costa, etc have rules against sitting inside if you haven’t bought anything? Will I get asked to leave if I’m just sitting quietly and studying? 

Thank you so much for reading this. I really appreciate any advice or help 💓💓💓 I hope everyone is having A good day ",83,1747068372.0,AskUK,166,0.77,False

The winner of the show was promised the chance to perform with a Grammy-winning artist, but Love viewed the exposure of being on an HBO series as the real prize. 



>Love flew from her home in New York to Los Angeles three times, on her own dime, for separate auditions and tapings of “Wings of Voice,” which was filmed on an HBO soundstage in Hollywood. She waited in line with more than a thousand aspiring singers, performed for judges and made it to the top 50.



>But one day before her final taping, Love made a shocking discovery: It was all fake.



>“Wings of Voice” was not a real singing competition. Instead, the show was an elaborate stunt devised by comedic mastermind Nathan Fielder, orchestrated solely for the purpose of making a tangential point in his social experiment series on HBO, “The Rehearsal.” 



>“I signed up to be a singer, not a lab rat,” Love says. Many of the contestants are just now finding out that they were essentially extras in an elaborate bit. Love says she spent $5,500 on travel, lodging and hair and makeup across her three trips to L.A. And as a vocal teacher in New York, she lost out on nearly $4,000 in canceled lessons. 



>In the back of a coffee shop in Greenwich Village, Love says she is breaking her nondisclosure agreement. “I’m legally not allowed to have this conversation with you right now, because I signed an NDA.” Without expanding further, Love says she is not scared of HBO retaliating against her for speaking out. “They don’t really have ground to stand on.”



>“I’ve been through a lot in my time. I put in my 10,000 hours, and I felt like there wasn’t a basic human respect for people who have devoted their lives to art,” she says. “I was at square one again, after 15 years professionally in this business.”",138,1747068152.0,Fauxmoi,39,0.93,False

1kkx8pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kkx8pv/coffee_ground_emesis_or_food_related/,Coffee ground emesis or food related?,"21F, I take adderall XR 15mg daily. 

I drank with some friends last night and I threw up (I’ll put the picture below) last night, and I am freaking out a little bit because I can’t tell if it’s coffee ground vomit or not because I know that’s a really bad thing. We were drinking vodka but I also drank a whole large coke so I’m wondering if it’s just from that? I threw up again this morning twice after drinking some Gatorade, both times it looked completely normal nothing dark. I am having some stomach and back pain but I am on my period and I have back pain regularly so I’m not sure if that could be related to it or not? I’m getting kind of scared looking at the picture but I don’t want to go to the doctor unless i absolutely have to because I don’t have insurance right now. I’ll post the picture in the replies

Edit: I tried to think back to everything I ate yesterday and I did also have a couple dark chocolate protein bars so that’s something that could’ve contributed to the dark vomit too. My stomach pain isn’t crazy intense but it feels like a different pain than period cramps so I wonder if I just upset my stomach by drinking too much? ",1,1747068065.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False
1kkx8l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1kkx8l1/our_rescue_is_driving_me_crazy_please_help/,Our rescue is driving me crazy. Please Help!,"This is going to be a long read and for that, I apologize. 

We have 2 Australian Shepherd and Rottweiler mixes. Our first dog, Tater we’ve had since he was a puppy. Our second dog, Dodge we’ve adopted after having Tater for a year. Now let’s get into it. 

My husband wanted Dodge because the lady at the rescue told him he was the same age as Tater and the same breed which made my husband want him because he thinks they are siblings and what are the odds of someone else around here breeding Australian shepherd and Rottweiler mixed puppies. I never got to meet Dodge until the day came for ME to pick him up. My husband had said he was a great dog. The day I picked him up, I had to pick him up with a friend’s help to get him into my jeep because he refused to jump. 

The first week I really wanted to return him. I crated him and even left some toys on there to chew on in case. I came home to him greeting me at the door. I walk into the house and he’s torn up my carpet, the remote controllers, everything. You name it, he had gotten a hold of it. I tried CBD for dogs and it didn’t really seem to help him. It became so bad I had to crate both two dogs together for him to stop acting out due to separation anxiety. I asked my husband if we could return Dodge while it was still early and he had made the statement if one was to be returned we were getting rid of Tater as well and I just shut up because I didn’t want Tater to go when he wasn’t the one making a mess of the house. 

Fast forward to almost 5 years later. I still don’t care for Dodge. I feel guilty that I don’t like him but he does things that get on my nerves. He waits for me to sit down and then comes and sits right in my face and pants. If I tell him to lay down or move. He'll get up and come back around the coffee table to sit back in the same spot and pant in my face again. Then he'll put his head down for me to rub him and when I do rub him, he has to constantly move his head all around. It’s like he can't sit still. He also does this horrid wet lip smacking sound that I cannot stand. Not to mention he's also food obsessed. I feed them regularly but the dog acts like it's his last meal. He can eat out of a slow feeder bowl in under 2 minutes. While my other dog takes twice as long to finish his food. He also wakes me up most nights by getting up super fast in his cage and making a bunch of racket when he hears one of us move around in the bed. He gets super excited when doing anything like getting out the cage in the morning and coming back outside after going potty. So excited that he has to beat his tail on the wall, running through the house and make a bunch of unnecessary racket. Not to compare dogs, but Tater is never that happy to get out of his cage or to come back in the house in the morning. Dodge is also the laziest dog I've ever met. I've tried walking with him but after a lap or so he will sit down on me stating he is done. Tater is very active and he will play with Dodge but it's never very long because Dodge gets tired I assume. 
I can’t leave Dodge out because he gets into stuff while we’re asleep so the only option is to put them both up at night. 

I’m at my wits end because I’m tired of not getting sleep. I’ve mentioned numerous times of getting rid of Dodge and every time it’s been met with if we get rid of Dodge we have to get rid of Tater.  I kind feel like things aren’t getting looked at from my POV  because the cage doesn’t bother my husband. He can sleep through a bomb and wouldn’t wake up but the minute he hears me complaining supposedly that wakes him up. 
We got into an argument this morning because Dodge woke me up at 3:00 am with rattling the cage and I couldn’t go back to sleep. It ended up with him crying saying we will just get rid of both of them and never have anymore dogs which isn’t what I was trying to get at when I was talking to him.  Please help with either advice to talk to my husband to try to get him to see from my point of view or other training tips and I can use because I can’t do this anymore.

That seems to be the heart of the matter here—morning coffee isn’t just caffeine delivery; it’s a source of comfort, enjoyment, and togetherness. Recognizing that, you’ve begun to question whether a more premium coffee maker, like the Moccamaster, would enhance that experience, even if you’re content with pre-ground beans and don’t consider yourself a connoisseur.

The Moccamaster is widely celebrated for its exceptional build quality, temperature precision, and brewing consistency. It’s hand-assembled in the Netherlands, often lasts two to three decades, and is backed by an industry-leading warranty. These machines are engineered to maintain the ideal brewing temperature (between 196°F and 205°F), ensuring optimal extraction of flavor from the coffee grounds. Compared to a typical Mr. Coffee machine, which often operates at lower or inconsistent temperatures, the Moccamaster provides a noticeably more balanced and nuanced cup—*even when using the same pre-ground coffee*. That means your bulk Starbucks French Roast, without any additional effort on your part, could taste smoother and more full-bodied simply because it’s being brewed under ideal conditions.

Still, your current Mr. Coffee maker has served you reliably, and you point out rightly that it can be replaced several times for the price of one Moccamaster. But what you’re really weighing isn’t just the dollars; it’s whether an everyday luxury like better coffee is worth the upfront investment. From a cost-benefit standpoint, if your Mr. Coffee is giving you 10+ years of service and you’re content with the coffee it produces, it’s doing its job well. However, if you’re curious whether that same coffee could taste better and enjoy the idea of upgrading something you use daily—especially for a ritual as meaningful as your shared coffee time—the Moccamaster delivers on both quality and durability. It becomes less about replacing a broken machine and more about refining a small but important part of your daily life.

Professionally speaking, if you’re sticking with pre-ground beans and want zero additional fuss, the Moccamaster still holds value. Its efficiency and design ensure that even simple inputs produce an elevated result. But if you’re looking to maximize its potential, using freshly ground coffee would offer a significant leap in flavor clarity. That said, there’s no need to upend your current routine unless you feel compelled to; the beauty of the Moccamaster lies in how well it performs even within low-maintenance habits.

Ultimately, if your goal is to get more enjoyment out of your morning coffee with your wife without introducing new complexities, the Moccamaster offers a real, perceptible improvement in taste and experience—even with pre-ground beans. It’s an investment not just in hardware but in the pleasure of a daily moment that clearly matters to you. Whether that’s worth the price is a question of values more than features, but from a professional coffee perspective, the answer leans firmly toward yes. Would you like suggestions on specific Moccamaster models or alternatives in a similar category?",1,1747067775.0,QualitySeek,1,1.0,False

Actually finding the right words for this is more difficult than I anticipated haha. Alright! I am searching for something serious and long lasting and real! I wonder if I make a post here I get some more out of it than from dating apps 🤢😂. They are just so draining and fake lol. Oh and monogamouso ofc!
First of all I don't mind long distance relationships as long as there is a want from both of us to get together at somepoint and that's why I'm okey with anywhere!

Now, a few words to introduce myself! 
I'm Marvin, 26 and from Germany. I am a huge gaming nerd and music enthusiast, currently I am even learning how to play the guitar! These two things really keep me going. Personality wise I would say that I'm a weird combination. Funny, confident, talkative but also edgy, emotional and stuck in my own head. Some online place said I'm an an INFP so that cool!  I don't smoke or do drugs, very rarely drink. I got no pricings but I'm tattooed!
I'm also very animal friendly I used to have a dog for a long time and currently got my little cat Huby! (Yes I can share pictures for sure haha)
I am very into psychology and mental health since I recently started investing in my own and now I have a much better understanding of that topic. It is so unbelievably important.
I live a pretty stable life when it comes to work and a place to live. I have my own house with garden but it's so much room and so much work for me all alone. This house needs some life with a loving girl next to me maybe some kids and maybe a family dog haha! Also I'm not dead set on this house. I wouldn't mind selling and relocating someplace nice. Just so you know lol. I'd like to have a girl that understands and cares for me, someone I can be a mountain to hold onto for, somebody I can share my passion and love with. I love spending time together doesn't matter what! Cooking together or grocerie shopping, showering or working in the garden, watching movies or playing video games together all of it is great. I don't mind sharing pictures or face timing at all whenever you feel comfortable with that! To be a bit confident I can say that I don't look all to bad I just haven't gotten any luck yet lol. That might change today tho!
I really hate talking about myself this much and the amount of ""I"" or ""I'm"" I said is actually upsetting me lmao 😭

So hey if you are still reading and are actually interested in learning more about me then feel free to send me a message! I don't really mind your age so 18-35 sound fine by me! I answer as soon as I see it. I got some free time at the moment haha! I'm looking forward to getting to know you! And if I'm not your cup of tea maybe I am a coffee lol 😉🤔

In a city built on symbols, a ghost becomes a threat. A girl is dead. The wrong name is blamed. And now the lines are moving.
Quietly, violently, unstoppably.

Location: Undisclosed Data Vault – Stahlburg Underground District, Early Morning

Walter Lennox lit another cigarette he wouldn’t finish.

The office was dim, just the cold hum of screens and a half-dead fan stirring recycled air. Rows of data fed across glass displays, contract logs, crypto bursts, redacted message headers. One thread caught his eye again.
Betty Smith. Dead. Seventeen.

He didn’t sigh. Didn’t curse. Just watched the footage loop one more time.

The Sentinel turned. Walked away. No flash, no smoke, no sound. But in the altered clip, the gun was there. Plain as fiction.

Walt crushed the cigarette into a half-full cup. The smoke curled like a question.

From the corner of the room, a shadow detached itself. A man. Ordinary, at least in silhouette. Walt never asked his name. Didn’t need to.

“Courier’s gone,” Walt said without turning. “Payload too.”

The man didn’t answer. Just waited.

Walt tapped a line of text on one screen. A red icon pulsed. An encrypted, short-range relay sprang to life.

“I want this delivered,” he said. “To him.”

The shadow shifted. “Message?”

Walt nodded.

‘Walt Lennox. Needs a conversation. Same terms as before. You’ll know where.’

He let it hang in the air like static. Then turned in his chair, finally meeting the other man’s eyes.

“If he doesn’t want to talk,” Walt added, “that’s his call. But I think he will.”

The man took the chip. Said nothing.

By the time Walt turned back to the screen, he was gone.

Location: The Farm – Outskirts of Stahlburg, Late Morning

The morning fog clung low to the fields, thick and slow like breath held too long. The farmhouse sat at the edge of the land. Built from weathered wood with quiet windows, and a tin roof that whispered when the wind changed.

Inside, Lukas Hartwick moved like a ghost in his own home.

He stood in the kitchen, a black hoodie over a shirt that had seen better years. Coffee steamed in a dented mug beside a silent phone. A local news stream flickered on the wall screen, muted.

He wasn’t watching it.

He was watching the corner of the room. Or maybe nothing at all.

The footage had been everywhere.

A body in a hoodie. A shadow with a gun.
No sound. Just a cut.
Then the headline:
“WANTED – THE SENTINEL.”

He hadn’t slept much.

Outside, one of the barn cats skittered across the porch, chasing a leaf. He didn’t look. Just closed his eyes and let the quiet press down.

She didn’t even know what she was carrying.

Betty. Young. Cocky. Confident in that way only someone who hadn’t been burned could be.

He never got her name. Only the moment when the cold hit. The spike. The silence. The feeling. Not of failure, just timing.

He could’ve reached her a second sooner.
Could’ve said more than “Give me the phone.”

Instead, she was dead. And the world called him the killer.

He exhaled through his nose and stepped away from the window. The floor creaked once. Familiar. Solid.

He walked past the front door and opened the narrow pantry that wasn’t a pantry.
Pushed through, down the stairs.

The lights below were low and warm. Walls made from clean concrete, workbenches and shelves. A screen blinked on.

NO SIGNAL DETECTED – SECURE CHANNEL DISCONNECTED

Lukas sat at the central console. Checked three secure feeds. He cross-checked transit schedules, replayed thermal footage of the substation. Nothing. No trace of the shooter. No trail to follow.

He rubbed his palm slowly over his beard, eyes heavy but still sharp.

Ghost work. Clean. No heat. No splash. Whoever did this wasn’t improvising.

The screen blinked once.

INCOMING MESSAGE
SOURCE: UNTRACEABLE – SAME TERMS AS BEFORE
WALT LENNOX WANTS TO TALK. YOU’LL KNOW WHERE.

Lukas stared at it for a long moment.

Then he stood, reached for the hidden drawer beside the console, and retrieved a small black card.

He didn’t speak. Just pocketed it.

The message hadn’t told him anything.
But it meant someone knew something.

And that was more than he had five minutes ago.

⸻

Location: Champion Agency AUREX – Aurex Penthouse, Central Stahlburg, Afternoon

The elevator doors slid open with a soft hiss.

Sunlight spilled across polished black tile and brushed steel. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the skyline. Banks of mirrored towers, transit drones, and the lazy arc of a high-speed magrail in the distance.

This was where the city looked its best.
And Titan Ray fit the view like it had been built for him.

He stepped into the atrium, fresh from a rooftop drop-in. His white and gold suit gleamed faintly even in shade, the bright contrast striking against his dark skin—a symbol by design, tailored for awe as much as function. A half-dozen holoscreens floated in the air to his left.
Newsfeeds, threat assessments, fan messages.

One headline pulsed brighter than the rest:
“WANTED – THE SENTINEL”

Marcus Raynor didn’t smile. For once.

Across the room, two of his colleagues, Champions named Signal and Arcjaw, glanced up from a tactical sim table.

“You’re still on that?” Arcjaw asked, flicking a virtual tile into position. “That guy’s been lurking for years. Never even proved he did anything.”

Signal didn’t look up. “Ghost types always trigger public paranoia. He’s just a symbol now.”

Titan Ray’s boots echoed lightly as he walked past them.

“It’s not about what he’s done,” he said. “It’s about what he is.”

Signal finally glanced over. “What? Quiet?”

“A rogue.”

He stopped in front of the central console, where the city’s Champion grid flickered in pale blue.
An overlay of confirmed sightings, patrol routes, and unverified blips.

He tapped The Sentinel’s marker. It flickered uncertainly.

“You get powers like ours, you go on the grid. You give back. You show your face.”
“He hasn’t. He doesn’t.”
“And now a girl’s dead.”

Arcjaw shrugged. “So go talk to the cops. This isn’t a solo mission, man.”

Marcus didn’t move. His voice was self-assured.

“I don’t need backup.”

He turned away from the console and strode toward the private hangar.

Signal called after him, half amused. “Just don’t turn this into a PR disaster, Titan.”

Marcus didn’t stop.

“This isn’t about PR.”

1kkx2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kkx2zo/anxiety_and_puppy_blues/,Anxiety and Puppy Blues,"I’m part of many puppy related subreddits, but I feel like I might find better specific advice here.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder(initially diagnosed nearly 10 years ago.) I currently take 10mg Prozac everyday and klonopin as needed.

I adopted a puppy nearly a month ago (she’ll be turning 13 weeks this week.) I knew raising a puppy would be hard (potty training, crate training, etc.) What I wouldn’t learn until after adopting her was the concept of puppy blues. I accepted I would have these feelings of regret and stress for a bit, but now I’m at a point of it affecting my daily life.

Last week (Monday night) I struggled with getting her to settle and she was incredibly nippy. When we have moments like that, I do my best to let us sleep on it and start fresh in the morning. That following morning (Tuesday) she picked up exactly where she left off the night before. I’d been existing with broken sleep for nearly a month. My anxiety was at an all time high (primarily chest pains). Meanwhile she is continuously nipping me. I stopped drinking coffee to not worsen the anxiety, but it doesn’t help with the exhaustion. I eventually called my mom breaking down. She suggested that she and my dad take the puppy for a few days so I could have a break.

I accepted the help, but I also felt incredibly guilty. I was away from her for three days but still felt the anxiety as if she was around. I might be getting more sleep, but I still deal with the chest pains. I’m sleeping now like a depressed person. I also work a full time job. I spent the weekend with my parents and the puppy where I still dealt with bad anxiety in the morning that would fade as the day went on. I still wasn’t at a point where I felt confident bringing her back to our home where it would be just me again.

I’ve gone ahead and booked an appointment with my doctor this week to see if I need a medication adjustment. I will also be going on a trip at the end of this week where the puppy will then be going to a sitter. I’m hoping by the end of the trip I’ll be in a better place. Everybody I’ve talked to and everything I read on the internet states that it gets better, but I’m guess I’m trying to figure out how to manage this period until it does get better.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I'm a coffee lover. Like, a huge one.

Some years ago, I bought an Aeropress as my first ""coffee machine"" (other than pods) and a cheap grinder off Amazon and some coffee. I fell in love with the process and became more and more obsessed with finding the perfect cup.

I then switched to espresso. I bought a Breville Bambino Plus, a 1ZPresso J, and expansive coffee. It took me about 15 minutes to make a single espresso on the daily, but I loved it.

Then, COVID hit me. At first, I couldn't smell anything at all. Then, when my sense of smell came back, I found the smell of coffee to be FOUL. Absolutely fucking disgusting.

I lost my spark. For a couple of months, I simply couldn't drink it, and when I got back, I got back to pods and sold all my stuff.

Now, it has been a month or two since I started wondering if I could revert back to my old self, and I wanted some help.

So, here I am. Diving back in, starting with the Aeropress.

I had two specific questions:

1. I know that the more expansive the grinder, the better it is. But as a starting point, is the KINGrinder P0 any good? I wanted to use specialty coffee with it.
2. Where can I find some good specialty coffee here in Europe? I am from Italy, but I am fine with waiting a week or two to get my package.

I went to a local grocery store and went to sit at their Starbucks and work for a little bit and let my car charge at their chargers during this time (very slow third party chargers but any charging is nice). I get a notification that my car stopped charging so I go out to have a look and I can see that someone unplugged it. The store manager walks up to me and says that I can’t charge my car there because it’s for their customers (which I am as I was sitting in their coffee shop) and proceeds to tell me that he was following me on their security cameras. I’m a somewhat younger female and this made me extremely uncomfortable so I took my stuff and left. I get it that he can use their cameras as he wishes but it felt like such a power trip and the way he said it made him sound like a creep.

I’m bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping but I don’t want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging. 

I’m also confused why he thought that unplugging it is the right way to go about it because it’s not like the car moves itself just because he unplugs it?

I am (F36) and my husband is (M42) we’ve been married 16 years and have 2 kids. I met a friend at work (M50)

**October:** Met a new coworker who seemed nice and playful. Noticed he was a little flirty but didn’t think much of it. Told my husband about it to stay transparent and avoid any tension later.

**Soon after:** The coworker started sending me memes and jokes on MS Teams, even during off hours. It felt harmless, just silly stuff that broke up the day.

**I told my husband:** I wanted to shift the chat to Facebook Messenger so it wouldn’t be a problem at work. I asked for his okay because I didn’t want him to feel uncomfortable. He said it was fine. That reassured me.

**Over time:** We kept chatting. It became a regular thing. It felt fun and low-stakes, a friendship that brought some lightness into my day.

**One night:** I had a long call with him while my husband was out of town. It went late, and yes, I had been drinking. It was just talking, but I didn’t think about how it might look. When my husband brought it up, I told him it was nothing. I meant that.

**Calls happened again:** Mostly when I had been drinking and wanted someone to talk to. It didn’t feel like a big deal to me because we weren’t talking about anything deep or romantic. Just surface-level stuff.

**Lunch:** I wanted my husband to see that me and my co-worker were just buddies. I suggested lunch with both of them so my husband could meet him and feel better about everything. To me, that showed I was willing to be open. Lunch was short but it was cool, my husband said he seemed like a nice guy

**Breaks at work:** We often take breaks together, usually with other people. It’s part of a routine now. I didn’t think it was crossing any lines. I even made sure to mention our inside jokes to my husband, so it didn’t feel like I was hiding anything.

**Deleted socials for a while:** That was for me. I wanted a reset. And yes, I felt really close to my husband during that time. I told my mom things were better than they’d ever been. That was true.

**January:** Got back on social media. The memes and jokes picked back up usually about dogs or silly work stuff. I told my husband we were going to adopt a rottweiler and share custody (inside joke but I think it bothered him).

**Calls started again:** Late night, after a few drinks, usually when my husband was asleep and I was bored. They helped me decompress. I didn’t think it was a betrayal because the conversations weren’t intimate or emotional in a romantic way.

**Husband got upset:** He told me it made him uncomfortable. I tried to reassure him. But when it kept coming up, it started feeling like he didn’t trust me, like I was doing something wrong when I wasn’t.

**Vegas trip:** I stayed in touch with my coworker a lot. I know I didn’t call my husband and I probably should have. I didn’t mean to make him feel replaced. But the conversations were just fun and comforting. I didn’t think it would be a huge deal.

**Husband saw messages:** He kept in touch during the trip, he checked in a lot. wanted to know when my plane landed, asked me to send pictures, told me I looked gorgeous, said “ILY,” and made comments like “you probably don’t miss work but you miss me a little.” It all felt light and playful to me, just part of our normal banter. I didn’t see it as crossing a line.

**Husband confronted me again:** At this point I felt like I couldn’t say or do anything right. I’ve never hung out with this co-worker 1 on 1 outside of work, not even lunch or coffee (he’s brought back lunch for me a few times but we ate in the breakroom) No matter how I explained, my husband keeps reading into things. It feels exhausting like we’ve been having the same conversation every time for the last several mos.

**Now:** I feel like I’m being constantly accused. I feel like I’ve lost parts of myself. I used to feel free in our relationship. Now I feel like I’m always being monitored or judged. I shut down not because I don’t care, but because I feel trapped. I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong, and I don’t want to feel bad for having a connection with someone I enjoy talking to.

We’ve been friends for almost a decade, meet up for coffee/food every now and then. Not a single hint of anything more than friendship from either side and we’re both in long term relationships. 

I was originally asked (a couple of years ago) to be part of the wedding party but I respectfully declined as I’m autistic and get anxious in large groups. Being part of the proceedings would be too much for me. 

Anyway, the wedding is on Saturday. A few days ago I sent her a message which I’ve quoted below:

“Hey,  I hope you’re ok and things are settling down.  I’ve been thinking a lot about your big day coming up. This is really hard for me to say, but I don’t think I’ll be able to attend.

The truth is, I’m massively burned out and overwhelmed. This new job is becoming mega stressful and I’m working ten hour days and sometimes not even getting a full break.  The prospect of socialising with people is filling me with panic and anxiety; I think my autistic ass is just ready to crawl into a hole and hibernate for a few months.  I’ve well and truly hit a brick wall.

I’ve been trying to think how best to explain this to you and I hope you understand.  This isn’t a reflection on you or how much I care; I’m genuinely gutted to miss such an important moment in your life. I hope you understand that I’m doing what I need to in order to look after myself, and I’ll be cheering you both on from afar.

Although we haven’t spoke as often recently with all the madness of life, I think about you guys often and really want you to have a great day.  If I was to attend with how I’m feeling now, I think I’d have a full on meltdown with lots of people around, music, and all that stuff.

I’d love to catch up with you when things are calmer, and buy you guys dinner as both an apology and my gift to you both.  I’d love to hear about the day then, when I’m not likely to just collapse with an anxiety attack.

I’m really sorry and I hope you understand.  I proper feel like I’m letting you down, but I think I’d let you down more if I turn up and bring everyone down.

I hope you’re not angry or upset.”

We haven’t worked together for a while and I’m in new employment in a very stressful job. 

I feel like I’m an asshole for missing this, but I’d feel a bigger asshole for going and ruining it. 

AITA?

EDIT: I had previously stated I would attend. Also, as lots of people mentioning it, there’s no formal dinner, seating charts, or any of that. It’s a wedding ceremony and then a reception with casual food, pop up food truck and such. It’s in the UK, not the US; some of these traditions are different - I should have specified that.

1kkwrla,https://i.redd.it/00b1b400nd0f1.jpeg,Scam ba 'to?,"Problem / Goal: Nag ooverthink ako dito sa opportunity na 'to kasi ang biglaan masyado. Feeling ko human trafficking kinemerut pala or what 

Context: Nag intervew ako sa cafe na 'to nung April 22, 2025. Tas ang sabi nila sakin during the interview ay may training kagad sa QC kinabukasan. Kaya icchat daw nila ako sa gabi ng april 22 if paano mangyayari. 

Hindi naman na sila nag text sakin nung gabi kaya inasumme ko nalang na hindi ako tanggap. Kaso ngayong May 10 (10pm), nagchat naman sakin na may training daw ng May 11. Kaya nagtaka ako kasi ang tagal na nung interview ko tas biglang nagparamdam and ang biglaan pa nung training.

Kinakabahan lang ako kasi baka mamaya hindi pala legit at baka paraan yun para mascam ako or kung ano man. Kaya nakikipag communicate naman ako sa nagtext sakin tas ang sabi lang nila ay legit naman talaga yung business at safe ako kasi panay babae naman kami bukas if tutuloy ako. sa personal vehicle rin kasi nila ako sasabay if ever

Nag phone call din kami tas sinabi naman niya na mali nila yon for not updating me properly and na safe naman daw nga kasi nakita ko naman in person na totoo naman talaga na may pinapatayo silang coffee shop.

What do you think?

The womens division is fine. Don’t have to worry about them. You look at the 2016 roster where the majority of these wrestlers were between the ages of 25 and 40. (With the exception of a few). This in my opinion is the perfect range for a roster. I’m not an “ageist” or whatever that is, I just look at the future. I think because of how NXT is being developed and it’s on tv, it feels like less of a rush for people to get called up on the main roster. They have yet to call up guys like Trick Williams or Ethan Page, two people who in my opinion are ready for that spotlight and position. I could be wrong.

1kkwnfn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkwnfn,Looking for Replacement Tenant for 25/26 Accommodation,"
Hi everyone, I hope this kind of post is okay here—if not, I’ll take it down. I’m currently looking for someone to take over my accommodation contract at Vita Student St Albans. It is a Studio on the 11th floor, room size is 20sq

The contract runs from 7th September 2025 to 11th July 2026, and the place honestly has everything you could want in student accommodation. It’s £13,609 (all bills included), and comes with a smart TV in every room, a walking shower, a really good gym, huge study spaces, a massive cinema room, a private dining area, ping pong table, and a coffee machine in the common area.

They also provide free breakfast Monday to Friday from 7–10am and a professional cleaning service every two weeks, which has been so convenient. The staff are honestly some of the nicest people, always helpful and friendly. There’s also a 24/7 reception, which gives real peace of mind.

The community vibe is amazing—they run lots of events and activities like Pilates every Sunday, social nights, and more. It’s a clean, modern, and really social place to live.

If you or anyone you know is interested, feel free to message me. I’m happy to share more info or photos!",0,1747066671.0,Leeds,8,0.22,False
