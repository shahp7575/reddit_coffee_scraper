I can‚Äôt remember having an actual bowel movement besides small bits in about 4-5 days. Today I had the urge and felt tremendous pain finally. Only pushed out very small hard stool. I can feel it at the entrance but it will not come out. I just took a capful of miralax (5‚Äô1, 155lbs, female) about an hour and a half ago. Should I try another scoop or maybe magnesium citrate as some have suggested? Coffee? And what to do about the pain? This is my first time ever suffering like this and I hate that I didn‚Äôt attempt to remedy this before it got this bad. ",1,1748117393.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

1kukln0,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1kukln0/setting_boundaries_with_mentor/,Setting boundaries with mentor,"Hi,

I need some advice. Recently went for dinner with a senior manager. I'm a younger woman, early in her career. The man has been mentoring me for a while which is why I ended up accepting after a lot of consideration. Is it normal for senior managers to go for dinner with younger women they are mentoring? Perhaps this is completely normal and I have nothing to worry about? I just normally never meet male colleagues outside workhours, only for lunch/coffee. 

Dinner was ok, but had some weird comments. People are strange sometimes so I thought some of his comments were just ... quirky. I don't quite know what to do now. I don't want to overreact. He didn't do anything that you could go ""report to HR"", but felt like he was very much toeing the line on what is appropriate and testing my boundaries a little bit. He doesn't directly impact my management, but I thought I had a senior colleague who I could trust. How do I gently but firmly set boundaries and make sure no more dinner invites are extended? Do I just take longer to reply when he messages and don't respond to his banter?

Maybe I am just being too sensitive? I feel like I oscillate between feeling ""oh it was fine "" and guilt/disgust. ",1,1748117330.0,managers,0,1.0,False

Because, honestly, how does anyone muster the energy to be that cheerful at the crack of dawn? But hey, in the land of emotional avoidance, denial is my weapon of choice. 

Tbh, it's kinda impressive how good we get at pretending those waffle-happy coworkers are just background noise when all we need is a caffeine IV drip to start processing human interaction. If avoidance was a sport, I'd surely have a gold medal by now... or at least an honorary mention ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

Anyone else find themselves perfecting the art of pretending inconvenient feelings‚Äîand people‚Äîdon‚Äôt exist until a certain amount of caffeine has been properly administered? üòÇ",2,1748117209.0,emotionDenialClub,0,1.0,False
1kukjnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1kukjnl/i_hate_this_feeling/,I hate this feeling,"Before I start, I just want to say I DO love my husband so much. Like more than anything.

Ever since I got pregnant I have such a distaste for men in general. And unfortunately, my husband takes the brunt of it considering we live in the same house. Everything he does or doesn‚Äôt do just puts me in a RAGE. I asked him three times today to please pick his clothes up off the kitchen table (it‚Äôs right next to the washing machine so we fold clothes on the table.) Except his WERENT folded and have been sitting there all week in a pile. I asked him for the last time and then went upstairs to lay down because my back was hurting. I come back down an hour later, he‚Äôs still on the couch‚Ä¶ I freaked out.

He also makes so many stupid comments about babies in general. Asks the DUMBEST questions. ‚ÄúWhen can I put him on a skateboard? Like 3 months?‚Äù DUDE. He hasn‚Äôt asked one reasonable question and this is our first. I bought him the ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù book because he ASKED for it. It‚Äôs been sitting on our coffee table collecting dust for 3 months. It makes me so upset that he can‚Äôt be serious. Everytime I ask him why he can‚Äôt be serious about this he says something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just silly‚Äù which I know. He‚Äôs very silly and normally I love that, just not about this!

Idk, even my brothers piss me off these days. I talk to them pretty often and everything that comes out of their mouths pisses me off. Is it the testosterone from carrying a boy? Idk. I don‚Äôt knowwwwwwwww but it makes me so upset that I feel this way.",2,1748117178.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Greetings. I'm a mushroom farmer, mushroom hunter, outdoorsman and citizen mycologist located in the Willamette Valley. I teach Oregonians how to forage sustainably while being responsible stewards to our public lands.

I farm some of our native species and help spread their genetics to farmers and hobbyists. I also sell a variety of mushroom products and forest products.

I'd like to invite you to ask any questions you may have about mushrooms, mushroom hunting, foraging or the outdoors.

I have a website with a foraging guide and summary of native PNW mushrooms

Also, I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it but my butthole also hurts if that makes sense like if I try to pass gas it hurts. It‚Äôs like the lightning butthole cramps I used to get on my period. 

The two days prior I was having a lot of what I think are Braxton Hicks on and off. My belly was tightening. It wasn‚Äôt painful, just uncomfortable at times. I was on my feet all day those days and also had coffee so thought it was just because of my activity and caffeine. My midwife knows I was having Braxton hicks a couple weeks ago during exercise and said it‚Äôs normal and safe and just means I need to chill out and hydrate. 

Then last night I was up all night with my calves cramping so bad it was waking me up in tears. Now today I‚Äôm cramping and my whole body is just sore even though I haven‚Äôt hardly done anything and I‚Äôm exhausted. My joints hurt really bad in my knees and ankles and hips all of a sudden too. This morning (about 5 hrs ago) I had sex so thinking maybe that caused some of my cramping? 

Is this normal? Should I be concerned? Am I just dehydrated or low on electrolytes?

I am not at all in a good place right now. I am currently living in Toronto, Canada. Moved here in 2023, from India, in hopes of a better life as a neurodivergent individual.

I got diagnosed with ADHD in 2022. But also sort of knew something was not right with me since my middle school days. 

I haven't been able to take meds persistently due to financial issues.

I'm struggling to enter into data field and find a stable job (preferably: data analyst) which is aligned with my long term goals.

I found data analyst role very interesting and it seemed to be naturally aligned to how my brain works.

However, it has been very rough to find a job, I know about saturation but I don't think about it too much

I know my education sort of reflects my adhd symptoms of impulsivity and incoherence.

Ug!  The thoughts have been overwhelming this week.  I feel like discovering this sub is a curse because now I am forced to confront how unhealthy my ""crush"" really is.  I don't have anyone I can talk to about this, I've already shared just a little with my family and distant friends and they are always asking me how ""things are going with that guy"".  I've obviously overshared with them -- but I think you all here would actually hear my tale and understand what I'm going through.

  
I work for a university - lots of employees, spread over a sizeable campus, with lots of siloed departments.  So you see, 'Daniel' who works in another department is my ""coworker"" but not someone I necessarily see a lot or have direct interaction with.  I met Daniel face-to-face at one of those optional weekly workshops that I usually avoid.  He was facilitating it and I'd actually previously exchanged email with him.  I was in the height of my divorce process and really just looking for a break in routine.  

I walked into the conference and Oh, wow! did he just have the cutest grin ever!  When I filed for divorce I told myself I would likely never fall in love, or have sex, ever again.  And I was okay with that, but suddenly I stopped feeling dead inside when I met Daniel.  I mistakenly thought he was quite a bit younger than me.  But nope!  we are only one year apart (late 40s).  A thought he must be married, great guy like that, and I even Facebook stalked him and found an (old) wedding photo, but he said something that made me think he was single.

Well hey, maybe there is hope for me?  Maybe I could meet a great guy my age like Daniel, now that I know they are out there.  So I go on the dating apps (my divorce was final at this point).  Okay, got some attention.  And then, oh shit!  It's HIS profile!  He is indeed single, and looking to date!  Now I see him everywhere on campus and hear his name constantly.  And....well....I started 'stalking' him.  I went to every single event he or his department put on.  I joined a class at our gym because he did a weekly thing there.  I volunteered for anything he might be a part of.  I figured out which parking lot he uses and started parking there.  I was inspired to take on a long term project in my department because it would give me reasons to collaborate with him.

It's been three years now and I wish I could stop the obsessive thoughts!  I dated another guy for a few months that I met on a dating app which distracted me for a while.  But as soon as we broke up all of the feelings for Daniel came back with a vengeance.  Just about everything I do at work includes a thought for how I could possibly use this to speak to him.  I practice my conversation starters so I will have witty and interesting things to say when I talk to him.  I use every shred of info I get about him from others to spin into some kind of scenario with him.  He doesn't drink? Well, make sure I work how I'm ""not much of a drinker"" into some casual conversation we have.  He lives in what neighborhood? Well, isn't there just the coolest coffee shop around there that I want to hang out in.

It's sick!  It's driving me crazy.  Though ironically the things I've been doing - going to the gym, trying to look my best, collaborating with other departments, creating student programming - have been good for my mental and physical health and my career.  But I haven't been out on a date in over a year - because I don't see any other guy measuring up to him.  But I know he is on a particular, so I keep my account active, hoping that he will see me and know that I am available.  (Ug!  I'm infuriated by the thought of him being on there!  Getting shot down by picky bitches because he isn't tall or rich and is kind of dorky {all the things I like about him!}  Or feeling like he has to settle when I would be perfect for him!). 

Sadly, this isn't my first bout of limerence.  Now that I'm looking back, I've always done this had massive, unrequited ""crushes"" on various men and women through my life.  I think it's a part of my pure-O OCD.  I've always had intrusive thoughts.  I think in a way my crushes have been a way to filter or at least control these thoughts.  I could obsess over and fixate on something ""pleasant"" - how our first kiss would go, or what song would play at our wedding, and come up with schemes to casually hang out together.  I'd thought that my 20 year marriage would have cured this, or at least that I would have matured beyond such foolishness, but apparently not.

I know it's unhealthy and it needs to stop.  I seriously considered a lesser job offer at another university longer than I should have, simply because then I would be free to ask Daniel out on a date.  I've used my own children to spend time with him!  Bringing them to campus/community events that his department was involved in which I wasn't interested in myself but appeal to teenagers.  

Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far.  It feels good to just lay it all out.",1,1748116472.0,limerence,0,1.0,False
1kuka8x,https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rWh6L3M4xuJa2EG4yw12MRdqqwl-udWET6GJtkKyqs/edit?usp=sharing,Beats & Beans Music Cafe: Tunes and Coffee to warm the soul,"Hey Reddit! I'm a percussionist returning to school for a degree in Commercial Music Technology with a Music Business concentration. I've taken a few wrong turns to get to where I am, but I feel like I have a pretty solid vision.

I live to make music, and just so happen to drink a lot of coffee along the way. I can only imagine that there are at least a decent amount of people reading this who fit that bill. Maybe you like tea or hot chocolate? How about a mocktail? Regardless, you probably have a refreshment nearby when you're on stage or in the studio.

Enter Beats & Beans. In 2021, I took a Restaurant Operations class where I drafted a concept for a cafe and board game lounge. While still fun and possible worth keeping the board games, I had to put them to the back burner for what really gets my foot tapping. I can go a few days, weeks, even a couple years without breaking into my shelf or running a D&D campaign. It stinks a bit, but I survived.

For context, we knew each other in Uni, she had someone and I also had someone. I later on split with the person I was seeing while for her, they continued all the way to last year. I always saw her as someone unique,, someone I wouldn't mind sitting down with and hearing them talk the whole day.


And so after so many years, we finally had that coffee (lunch). It was vibes for the most part. She has changed alot and so have I. Najua mtasema it will end in tears..but at least I took the initiative.


I'm happy at the prospect (LinkedIn language). Whatever the outcome. I've seen enough in these Nairobi streets and this is the closest I've hard to a normal date in a long time.

‚ÄúOh, we just saved for a year or two, bought a nice place near the city, raised three kids, and still had money for vacations and lawn darts!‚Äù

Meanwhile in 2025:
You‚Äôre 34, sharing a 2-bedroom with someone named Kyle who only communicates in grunts and DoorDash coupons, while trying to outbid 27 couples, 6 hedge funds, and a mysterious numbered company from Luxembourg for a semi-detached in Oshawa with no roof and ‚Äúgreat bones.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs talk numbers before we cry into our recycling bins:

1975: Average house price in Canada: $55,000.
Minimum wage: $2.40/hr.
Ratio of house price to annual income: 3 to 1. Easy peasy, sign and squeegee windshields on King Edward all the way to home ownership.

2025: Average house price: $760,000.
Minimum wage: About $17.60/hr.
Ratio of house price to income: 8 to 12 to 1‚Ä¶ depending on if you‚Äôre allowed to count tears as equity.

And no, renting isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúeasy alternative.‚Äù You're paying $2,300 a month for 620 square feet with a view of a brick wall and a dryer that sounds like it‚Äôs summoning demons from a Whirlpool dimension.

Gone are the days when your mortgage was less than your car insurance. Today? You‚Äôre lucky if your rent doesn‚Äôt force you into learning how to make soup from old ketchup packets and optimism.

So what happened? Simple:
Wages stagnated. Housing exploded.
Millions moved to Canada at a dangerous rate when compared to new housing supply. That existing supply? gobbled up by speculators, so here's the gist of what's happening:

Canada‚Äôs housing crisis isn‚Äôt just about supply and demand‚Äîit‚Äôs also about homes sitting empty while people sleep in shelters or pay half their income in rent. As of 2021, over 1.34 million homes in Canada were vacant, representing about 8.7% of the nation‚Äôs total housing stock. While not every empty home is an investor‚Äôs toy, a huge chunk are believed to be owned by folks who see property not as shelter, but as a speculative goldmine with granite countertops.

Take Toronto and Vancouver‚Äîground zero for real estate madness. In Toronto, 21% of all housing and a whopping 56% of condos are investor-owned. Vancouver‚Äôs not far behind, with 48% of condos and 33% of all housing held by investors. Many of these units sit empty, especially in the high-end market, acting more like bank accounts with windows than homes for real Canadians. And while cities have responded with vacancy taxes‚Äî3% in Vancouver and now 3% in Toronto‚Äîthe long-term impact is still up in the air.

The real question is: Should housing be a human right or a hedge fund strategy? Because right now, it feels like average Canadians are trying to buy shelter in a casino. If you‚Äôre tired of watching foreign shell companies and domestic flippers treat housing like Monopoly with better snacks, join us at r/PersonalFinanceEh‚Äîwhere we don‚Äôt just talk interest rates, we talk interesting rage.

Governments passed the buck like a hot poutine. And somehow, YOU got told it‚Äôs your fault for buying too many lattes.

Spoiler alert: It ain‚Äôt the coffee, Karen. It‚Äôs the system.

But hey, it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. There‚Äôs a place where you can laugh through the madness, cry into your Excel sheet, and learn how to budget like a frugal beaver in a recession.

Welcome to r/PersonalFinanceEh ‚Äî the only subreddit where we discuss compound interest, credit hacks, and which brand of peanut butter is on sale, and how you can save on maple spread like true patriots.

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how many cups of coffee I drank, how many ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù meals I forced down, or how many hours I slept‚ÄîI never truly felt like myself.

I‚Äôm talking about **MITOLYN**.

And if you‚Äôre reading this right now, I want you to pay attention. Because this isn‚Äôt just another overhyped product. MITOLYN delivered real, tangible, life-changing results for me‚Äîand it might do the same for you.

# ‚ö° What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average health supplement. It‚Äôs a scientifically formulated mitochondrial enhancer that works at a **cellular level**. While most supplements only mask the symptoms of fatigue or brain fog, MITOLYN goes straight to the root cause‚Äî**your mitochondria**, the energy factories of your cells.

When your mitochondria are sluggish, you feel sluggish. When they‚Äôre powered up, you become unstoppable.

MITOLYN is designed to **optimize mitochondrial function**, restore natural energy, sharpen focus, and improve overall vitality‚Äîwithout caffeine crashes or artificial junk.

# üî¨ What Happened When I Started Taking MITOLYN

Let me walk you through my personal experience, step by step.

**Day 1-3:**  
I honestly didn‚Äôt expect much at first. I took 2 capsules with my morning water. Within a couple of hours, I felt‚Ä¶ a little clearer. A slight lift in my brain fog. I was cautiously optimistic.

**Day 4-7:**  
This is where things got exciting. I was waking up before my alarm‚Äî**without the usual grogginess**. I didn‚Äôt crave afternoon naps or extra caffeine. I actually wanted to work. I was productive, focused, and surprisingly calm under pressure.

**Week 2:**  
My body started to feel lighter, more agile. My mental clarity was through the roof. Even my digestion improved. Friends noticed I looked ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and asked if I was doing something different. The **confidence boost** that came with this transformation was priceless.

**Week 3 and beyond:**  
I became a different person. **Motivated, balanced, full of life**. The fatigue that once held me back was replaced by a flow of energy that made every day feel exciting.

MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just help me feel better‚Äîit helped me perform better.

# üí° Why MITOLYN Works (When Other Products Fail)

I‚Äôve taken dozens of supplements over the years. Most are filled with empty promises. But MITOLYN is **backed by real science**. Here‚Äôs what makes it stand out:

* **Mitochondrial Support Formula** ‚Äì It works at the cellular level, restoring the very source of your body‚Äôs energy.
* **Clean Ingredients** ‚Äì No fillers, no sketchy chemicals, no artificial stimulants. Just powerful, natural compounds.
* **Zero Crash** ‚Äì The energy boost is clean, consistent, and long-lasting.
* **Brain & Body Benefits** ‚Äì It improves not just physical energy, but also mental clarity, mood, and focus.

The results weren‚Äôt ‚Äúovernight magic,‚Äù but within days, I could tell something inside me was waking up.

# ‚úÖ What I Love About MITOLYN

# ‚ö° What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average health supplement. It‚Äôs a scientifically formulated mitochondrial enhancer that works at a **cellular level**. While most supplements only mask the symptoms of fatigue or brain fog, MITOLYN goes straight to the root cause‚Äî**your mitochondria**, the energy factories of your cells.

When your mitochondria are sluggish, you feel sluggish. When they‚Äôre powered up, you become unstoppable.

MITOLYN is designed to **optimize mitochondrial function**, restore natural energy, sharpen focus, and improve overall vitality‚Äîwithout caffeine crashes or artificial junk.

# üî¨ What Happened When I Started Taking MITOLYN

Let me walk you through my personal experience, step by step.

**Day 1-3:**  
I honestly didn‚Äôt expect much at first. I took 2 capsules with my morning water. Within a couple of hours, I felt‚Ä¶ a little clearer. A slight lift in my brain fog. I was cautiously optimistic.

**Day 4-7:**  
This is where things got exciting. I was waking up before my alarm‚Äî**without the usual grogginess**. I didn‚Äôt crave afternoon naps or extra caffeine. I actually wanted to work. I was productive, focused, and surprisingly calm under pressure.

**Week 2:**  
My body started to feel lighter, more agile. My mental clarity was through the roof. Even my digestion improved. Friends noticed I looked ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and asked if I was doing something different. The **confidence boost** that came with this transformation was priceless.

**Week 3 and beyond:**  
I became a different person. **Motivated, balanced, full of life**. The fatigue that once held me back was replaced by a flow of energy that made every day feel exciting.

On Tuesday 6 of us met and went out to a social activity, this was the first stop, so we were pretty sober still. She said you look a bit like my ex but much more attractive', which suggests I'm her type. She also made sure I had her number, and named herself in my phone as 'favorite person ever'.  
  
After the social activity, we went to a bar and 3 people left, so it was me, her and 'frank' who's a mutual friend (she said he's like an annoying cousin, certain it's a platonic friendship) , we kept drinking and then she eventually sat on my lap and would touch my hands etc.   
  
Eventually 'Frank' left at around 11PM, me and her stayed out and went to another bar, eventually we decided to just walk around the city and she grabbed my hand and we wandered for hours just talking, laughing and being flirty - we clicked really well. We stayed out until 2:30AM, and called separate Taxis home.   
We texted in the taxis how we both had a nice time and really enjoyed spending time together. The next few days, we were texting non-stop about everything, with cute emojis, teasing etc. (sort of flirty).   
  
on Thursday we had a phone call for an hour the same vibe from texting continued, and she said she's going to be in the office on Friday and said I should come because she'll be there, I then asked her if she wanted to do something after work and she said yes.   
  
On Friday (Yesterday), at the end of the work day, I went and found her (didn't hug her, because we were in the office), and we went to the bar near by, for what I thought was a date-like situation, she then said 'I should invite 'frank'' my ADHD kicked in and I started overthinking it so I suddenly thought 'oh, this is 100% platonic'.  
  
'Frank' couldn't come so it was just us two. I went into it thinking it was just friends hanging out, I wasn't flirty with her, didn't really touch her, didn't give any indication that I like her because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable as I thought this was suddenly a platonic thing.  
However, we did laugh and talk for 6 hours at this bar when she eventually said she needs to go home (around 9:30PM).  
  
We both got on the same train and sat next to each other, when it was time for me to get off, I felt it'd be too awkward to hug her as the arm rest was in the way and there were people standing in front of us, so i kinda just said 'cya'. 



I'm kicking myself so badly because I overthought the situation about this girl I'm into and kept it strictly platonic and didn't let it see where it could go. 



This morning I sent her a message and she hasn't even opened it, which is completely different to how it was before and I believe it's because she was expecting more/for it to be flirty like Tuesday.



What would you recommend I do? Ultimately I want a re-do of Friday and we actually get to know each other instead of me biting my tongue and keeping it platonic, which I believe would've been reciprocated looking back at the situation/all the obvious signs which i missed.

 I've written out a message I was tempted to send, or I can wait until Tuesday and ask if she wants to get a coffee in the office. 

This is the message I was prepped: 

Sooo I‚Äôve gotta admit something ‚Äî I went into our drinks thinking it might be a bit of a see if we get along/semi-date kinda thing‚Ä¶ But when you invited 'Frank', my ADHD kicked in like ‚Äòah shit, this is 100% platonic.‚Äô So I basically friend-zoned myself to avoid misreading things. But now I‚Äôm realizing I overthought the whole thing which is very standard, basically, I like you - I‚Äôm just an idiot.

  
Please let me know what you think is the best way to salvage this and try again :)

  
TL;DR: 

Met a work colleague at a social night, we hit it off and started flirting over text. After a fun night out where she got really touchy and flirty, we kept chatting non-stop. We agreed to meet after work, but when she said she will invite our mutual friend, my ADHD brain overthought it and I assumed it was just a friendly hangout. I held back flirting, kept it platonic, and now she hasn‚Äôt even opened my message the next day. I think I misread the signs and missed the chance.",1,1748115605.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Among bills and expired driver‚Äôs licenses, I discovered a yellowed envelope. Inside was a crumpled letter sent from a town called Lowdell‚Äîa speck on the map, two hours north. The return address read: George and Marilyn Arder. At first, the names meant nothing.

But George brought back the smell of smoke.

Looking back now, I don‚Äôt know why I went there. But I‚Äôve always been curious, and something pulled me toward that place. Forbidden fruit is sweet, right? So, during break, I decided to meet my grandfather. I rehearsed questions‚Äîwhy he and Dad were estranged, what happened‚Äîbut none of it would matter.

Lowdell was smaller than any town I‚Äôd seen: one gas station, one diner, one grocery store, and houses scattered along winding roads like fallen teeth. The last stretch from the bus stop, I walked. At the end of a gravel path, framed by bare trees and silence, stood a red wooden house.

He opened the door before I could knock.

""Good Lord Almighty!"" he boomed, grinning wide with crooked teeth. ""Look who it is‚Äîmy favorite grandson! God, it‚Äôs good to see ya!""

Grandpa was massive. His frame barely fit the doorway. He wore a brown flannel shirt stretched over his gut, the collar stained, a thick pipe seemingly fused to his lips. His hug knocked the air out of me.

Behind him stood Grandma. Her hair was neatly pinned, her sweater hanging loose, as if years of worry had whittled her down to bone. Her eyes met mine‚Äîand didn‚Äôt match her smile. They said, ""What have you done?""

Grandpa ushered me inside, clapping my back so hard I stumbled. The house smelled of smoke, meat, and something coppery-brown. The furniture was old but sturdy, the kind that outlives generations. He gave me a tour, laughing and gesturing wildly, and I sat with them in the living room, dark from heavy curtains. Grandma brought me tea with trembling hands. The first few days were‚Ä¶ tolerable.

Grandpa joked, smoked nonstop, and taught me woodcarving. He told stories to neighborhood kids who trickled in after school, two or three at a time. He was what people call ""the life of the party."" And he really was. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but Grandpa had this magnetism‚Äîpeople just gravitated toward him. He was kind, genuine, funny. His life stories were fascinating, and he clearly loved the attention, his pipe never leaving his mouth. Everything seemed normal.

Except for one thing.

His appetite.

He ate constantly. Bacon by the pound, bread by the loaf, pies in single sittings. Once, I watched him devour an entire rotisserie chicken and a pan of cornbread before dinner. He chewed loudly, wheezing, sweating, never stopping. Plates piled around him like building blocks, yet he always wanted more‚Äîlicking plates, sucking grease from his fingers, gulping tea by the liter, nearly choking on it.

Grandma brought out plates piled with pork chops, sausages, whole chickens, gravy boats the size of bowls, and he inhaled it all, groaning with pleasure. His face gleamed with grease. He didn‚Äôt chew so much as engulf, as if tasting was optional.

""You always eat like this?"" I asked, half-joking.

He grunted around his pipe and patted his belly.

""Big man needs big meals.""

I figured he just‚Ä¶ needed a lot of food. But not this much. All day, he only ate and smoked, barely able to move from his chair, just sitting in the kitchen, waiting for the next massive meal. Hell, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve eaten as much in my life as he did in one dinner. Still, evenings with him were fun‚Äîuntil the hunger returned.

One night, Grandma caught me alone in the hall while Grandpa snored like a bear in the next room.

""You need to leave,"" she whispered, her face pale, lips cracked. ""While he‚Äôs asleep. Tomorrow. First thing.""

""But why‚Äî?""

She flinched at the sound of heavy footsteps. Grandpa emerged from the shadows, pipe smoldering, eyes unreadable.

""Everything alright?""

""Just telling him about my childhood,"" Grandma answered too quickly.

Grandpa stared at us in silence, and for the first time, I felt afraid. The only light was his burning pipe; the only sound, his labored breathing. He filled the hallway, his bulk swallowing the space.

""This house has many stories,"" he finally rumbled before retreating to bed.

I barely slept that night‚Äîbetween Grandpa‚Äôs snoring and the dread gnawing at me. Leave in a hurry? But why?

By morning, the fridge was empty. Grandpa sat at the table, licking his lips, breathing hard.

""Where‚Äôs that woman gotten to? Starvin‚Äô over here...""

Grandma returned with three bulging grocery bags and frantically unpacked them, cooking while Grandpa fidgeted, growling incoherently. I claimed I wasn‚Äôt hungry (a lie). Watching him eat‚Äîdevouring even the gristle‚Äîmade me nauseous. Instead, I went to the store, chewing on Grandma‚Äôs warning. Something about this was starting to scare me, especially one thought: How does he eat so much? At his age, that obese, chain-smoking‚Äîhow was his heart still beating?

At the store, the clerk and a woman were whispering, tense, glancing at the windows.

""Ben‚Äôs lost another pig,"" the woman muttered. ""Sixth one.""

""Coyote? Bear?"" the clerk asked vaguely.

""When‚Äôs the last time you saw a coyote‚Äîlet alone a bear‚Äîaround here?""

""Uh, sorry,"" I cut in awkwardly. ""Animals are disappearing?""

""You new here, kid?"" The woman sighed, recalling something grim. ""First pigs. Then goats. Chickens. Even dogs‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs left is just bones‚Äîgnawed, split open‚Ä¶ like something sucked out the brains. But no one‚Äôs seen an animal do it. No tracks. No blood.""

Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was drenched in sweat. They didn‚Äôt know what could do this‚Ä¶

But I might.

And Grandpa? He still laughed, smoked, told stories. Evenings, he‚Äôd call me to the porch, where kids gathered like moths to his booming voice. One older girl‚Äîmaybe ten‚Äîsat at his feet and asked:

""Mister Arder, are you ever scared?""

He looked at her and smiled slowly.

""Only when the meat runs out,"" he said, laughing like it was a joke.

The kids laughed too.

I didn‚Äôt.

When I asked about the missing animals, Grandpa just chuckled through a mouthful of stew.

""Wild times, huh? Makes me feel young again.""

He played cards with me and the kids. Everyone adored him. But I grew uneasy around his bloated body, his yellow teeth grinning through smoke as he launched into another story‚Äîtoo good, too vivid, too scary. The kids leaned in, wide-eyed, while Grandpa basked in their attention.

Until Grandma, shaking, announced:

""We‚Äôre out of food. Nothing left. No meat, no eggs, not even flour‚Äîwe can‚Äôt‚Äî""

""Find more,"" Grandpa growled, pupils shrinking to pins. ""I‚Äôm starvin‚Äô.""

He didn‚Äôt move from his chair. Even when we went to bed, he stayed in the kitchen. Around 3 AM, I woke up thirsty and flicked on the kitchen light‚Äîthen nearly had a heart attack.

Grandpa was still in his chair, trembling, staring at the same spot. His skin was pale, almost translucent, veins purple beneath. His pipe was gone. For the first time, I saw him without it, and that alone made me want to crawl into a corner. At first, I thought he was dead‚Äîbut then he shook harder, sweat beading on his forehead.

""Grandpa? You okay?"" I whispered.

""Get me food, boy.""

His voice held no trace of the man I‚Äôd known. No warmth. Just threat. Something not human.

""I‚Äôll go to the store in the morning. Just sleep, Grandpa.""

""Get. Me. Food.""

He didn‚Äôt look up. I edged past him, turning off the light. All night, strange sounds came from below‚Äîgrowls, wet slithering, the front door creaking. At dawn, Grandpa was gone, the door ajar.

Grandma stood behind me, eyes red with fury and regret.

""Go, grandson. Now. He won‚Äôt be satisfied with store food. Pack your things and leave!""

""But‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with Grandpa? How can he eat so much?""

""You don‚Äôt want to know what happens when he stops eating.""

She turned to leave but froze at my next question:

""Why do you stay with him?""

""If no one controls him‚Ä¶ it gets much worse.""

That morning, the town buzzed with news: a boy had vanished overnight. Only bones were found‚Äîcleaned, not a scrap of meat left. No animal could‚Äôve done that.

And I knew exactly what could.

I returned to the house. Grandpa sat on the porch, pipe in teeth, smoke wreathing his head. His shirt was stained‚Äîworse than usual. He stared into nothing.

""Boy,"" he rasped, voice thick with smoke, ""Fetch me somethin‚Äô from the store.""

Something was off that morning‚Äîhis posture too rigid, eyes glassy, lips cracked. Skin pale and swollen, like raw meat.

I mumbled an excuse and went to pack. Then I heard them arguing.

""The kids are comin‚Äô tonight,"" he snarled. ""They want stories.""

""No,"" Grandma said. ""Not this time. I‚Äôll call the police. I‚Äî""

""You won‚Äôt do shit.""

Then she screamed‚Äînot in fear, but rage:

""I won‚Äôt let you feed on them again!""

I backed away. I didn‚Äôt want to know what that meant. Didn‚Äôt want to see more.

Dusk fell too fast.

The kids arrived on foot, alone, drawn like moths. George waited on the porch‚Äîbloated, sweating, unable to rise. Blisters covered his hands. His jaw‚Ä¶ elongated. He still smiled‚Äîbut not like before. Something inside him was pushing out.

Grandma begged them to leave.

""You don‚Äôt understand,"" she wept. ""This isn‚Äôt a game. Go home.""

""Please, Mrs. Arder, just one story!"" the kids pleaded.

""Get out! Now!"" she hissed.

""Let ‚Äòem be,"" Grandpa‚Äôs voice growled from behind, making everyone jump. ""Kids want stories.""

He shut the door after them.

Grandpa swelled. Grotesquely. Glassy-eyed, he stared at them, his pipe forgotten. He didn‚Äôt speak. Couldn‚Äôt stand. The kids giggled nervously in a semicircle. I watched, helpless, knowing something terrible was coming.

""Mister Arder,"" one child said, ""Don‚Äôt tell our parents we came, okay? They‚Äôve banned us from going out‚Ä¶ but we need your stories!""

""I‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ tell‚Ä¶"" Grandpa gasped, clutching his chest. ""Won‚Äôt tell‚Ä¶""

Then I saw it‚Äîhis shirt ripping, hands swelling, mouth unhinging wider than possible. He collapsed from his chair onto all fours. The kids screamed. So did I.

His arms melted, fat dripping like candle wax. His distended belly dragged on the floor. Blisters erupted across his skin‚ÄîGod help me, his face slid into a wet, jagged grin of meat and fangs.

Grandma stepped between him and the kids, gripping a fireplace poker, her eyes darting to me‚ÄîRUN.

""No more, George,"" she said. ""If you want meat‚Ä¶ take me.""

He didn‚Äôt hesitate.

One swift motion‚Äîher head vanished into his maw.

The kids rushed the door, but it was locked. They pounded, shrieking. I stood frozen, praying this wasn‚Äôt real.

But it was.

Grandpa‚Äînow a slithering mountain of hunger‚Äîgurgled, hissed, and dragged his bulk toward the children. I wish I could say I helped. But I couldn‚Äôt. I vomited at the sounds, couldn‚Äôt even look. Finally, I moved‚Äîbolting to the attic, heart hammering.

I stayed there‚Äîshaking, gasping‚Äîas the house filled with the sounds of slaughter. Chewing. Crunching bones. One voice. Then another. Then silence.

Sniffing. Scratching. Something huge lumbered down the hall, snuffling, muttering. I pressed into the rafters, too afraid to cry. Hours stretched into centuries. Then, a wet, slurping voice:

""Boy‚Ä¶ Come back‚Ä¶ Feed your grandpa‚Ä¶ I smell you.""

I buried myself in dust and shadows, praying to disappear. I stayed until the silence returned and dawn crept in.

I crept downstairs, stepping over bones and blood. Grandpa was gone‚Äîonly a greasy stain remained where he‚Äôd fallen. The house reeked of death. I vomited down my pants.

Then I ran‚Äîuntil the road turned to asphalt. Didn‚Äôt stop, even at headlights. I told no one‚Äînot the police, not the townsfolk. I don‚Äôt know what happened after. Where Grandpa went.

I returned home. Couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat. I vomited, cried, had nightmares of that night.

Months later, at breakfast, I met Dad‚Äôs eyes and asked:

""Why didn‚Äôt you tell me?""

He stared into his coffee.

""I hoped you‚Äôd never go there,"" he said softly. ""You weren‚Äôt supposed to know that address. Guess blood calls to blood.""

""What does that mean?""

He looked up, eyes bitter.

""You‚Äôre not my son.""

Silence fell like snow.

""I mean‚Ä¶ You are my son. I raised you. I love you. But you‚Äôre not mine. George brought you as a baby. Said he found you by the river. I didn‚Äôt ask. Didn‚Äôt want to know. But your real parents‚Ä¶""

""What happened to them?""

He swallowed.

""George got hungry. That‚Äôs all you need to know.""

""And you‚Ä¶ How did you live with him?""

""We moved town to town, keeping him fed. But it was never enough. When I was sixteen, we settled in Lowdell. A month later, he brought you. I escaped with you‚Ä¶ He stayed. For eighteen years.""

Now I live with that truth. Try to forget. But some nights, I wake tasting ash and smoke. I hear news reports‚Äîmissing animals, missing people. I lock the windows.

The guilt eats me alive. Those kids‚ÄîI knew. I could‚Äôve stopped it. Could‚Äôve spoken up. But I was scared.

And that‚Äîlike the nightmares‚Äîwill haunt me forever.

This is just a quick, extremely easy recipe that's delicious. Growing up in Arkansas, chicken and rice was a weekly meal, but we generally cooked with different aromatics, giving it an American soul food flavor profile. Oyako means ""parent and child,"" which is a punny title for this dish since it's mainly chicken and egg. In this recipe, the chicken comes before the egg.

- 2.5lb package boneless skinless chix thighs (cut them into bite sized pieces)(marinade in soy)
- 4 yellow onions (julienne)
- 6 to 8 eggs (separate yolk and whites)
- one bunch green onions (thin slices on bias)
- 100ml mirin, 100ml sake (cheap geikkekan), 300ml soy (I used usukuchi and kikkoman)
- 500ml dashi stock* (you might have to order katsuobushi, kombu, and possibly dried shiitake for this if you don't have an H mart or Asian grocery store nearby)
- nori sheets
- toasted sesame seeds (I pulsed mine in a coffee bean grinder since I couldn't find my mortar and pestle)
- steamed short grain white rice

*simple, quick dashi stock: 500ml water+a chunk of kombu (around 10g)+2 dried shiitake caps+2 handfuls of katsuobushi+onion skins from the 4 that were julienned for the recipe. Drop everything into the water and let sit to the side for a bit to rehydrate the kombu and shiitake. Do this first as you wash your rice 4 to 5 times until water runs clear. After kombu and shiitake rehydrate, cook on lowest setting. Don't boil. The kombu will get slimy and bitter if you boil it. Once you get to a decent simmer (180-190‚Å∞F) drop katsuobushi in and let steep for 10 minutes. Strain. Dashi stock done. Set kombu to the side. Once your rice is done boiling and is on low with the lid on, add the piece of kombu to add a little extra umami to the rice.

Cut chicken, throw in plastic bag with some soy for about 30 minutes. I used chashu simmer sauce here since I make a lot of chashu pork and always freeze the sauce after for other dishes. It's simply 1:1:1 soy, water, sake with green onions, ginger, peppercorns, and a little brown sugar. Soy sauce works fine.

This dish is easiest in a rice cooker, but for simplicity sake, I'll give instructions for a Dutch oven or pot.

Get Dutch oven preheated on medium high. Use a little neutral oil with a high flash point. I had some scallion+chili+garlic aroma oil that needed to be used, so I used that here. Vegetable oil, avocado oil, lard, tallow, etc. all work fine. Grab a few sacrificial pieces of your chicken thighs (pick fattier ones) and build a little fond in the bottom of the pan. Splash a little sake in the pan and use a wooden spoon to release the fond.

Drop chicken, onions, 500ml of the dashi stock, and the 500ml mixture of mirin+sake+soy into the Dutch oven. Cook on high with lid on for 20 to 30 minutes.

After that, open the lid and drop egg whites. Cook 2-4 minutes until you see them start to solidify. Don't stir this a bunch or the eggs bits will be too tiny. Lightly break the egg yolks (don't beat them until they're smooth). Once the egg whites have started to solidify, drop in the yolks. Cook for another 4 minutes, give them one gentle stir.

Done. Depending on how small you cut your chicken, it should be cooked through here. Make sure it's reached 165‚Å∞ if you cut them on the larger side.

*plating*

Rice in bowl. Use a slotted spoon to top with onion, chicken, egg. Use a ladle to pour a scoop or two of liquid over the top. You can go heavy or light with the liquid; I like to cover my rice completely. Not ""soup,"" just wet. Just be sure to save what liquid you don't use, as it's a great addition to many other recipes. It has profound umami from the dashi stock. 

Finally, top with sesame seeds, green onion, and chiffonade nori (optional). 

If you have a rice cooker, just throw everything (minus eggs, green onion, and sesame seeds). Steam 20 minutes, add egg white (steam another 3 or 4 minutes), then add yolks and steam an additional 3 to 4 minutes (or to your preference of doneness.)",2,1748115288.0,TrueChefKnives,2,0.75,False
1kujump,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceEU/comments/1kujump/hepatoburn_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest/,HepatoBurn Review'S and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer Reviews 2025!,"After reading a ton of **HepatoBurn reviews** and finally deciding to try it myself, I figured I‚Äôd share my **first-hand experience** with this unique liver-focused fat-burning supplement. I‚Äôve been using **HepatoBurn** daily for the last **6 months**, and I want to give you a real, no-BS look at what happened ‚Äî the good, the great, and anything in between.

If you're someone who‚Äôs been struggling with stubborn belly fat, slow metabolism, or just feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù due to a sluggish liver or aging metabolism, this might be the post for you.

# Why I Tried HepatoBurn in the First Place

Like many people, I hit my 40s and noticed some frustrating changes:

* **Extra weight around the belly** that wouldn‚Äôt budge, no matter how clean I ate
* Slower **metabolism and energy crashes** during the day
* **Brain fog** and a general lack of motivation
* A feeling like my body was ‚Äúclogged‚Äù or out of sync

I‚Äôve always been skeptical of fat burners because most rely on **stimulants and caffeine**, which just make me jittery and don‚Äôt help long-term. But **HepatoBurn caught my eye** because it focuses on a **different mechanism ‚Äî supporting your liver**.

Turns out, your liver plays a massive role in **metabolism, hormone balance, and fat storage**, especially around the midsection. So when I saw that HepatoBurn was made to **reignite your body‚Äôs fat-burning by supporting liver function**, I decided to try it ‚Äî and I‚Äôm really glad I did.

# What Is HepatoBurn?

**HepatoBurn** is a natural supplement that supports the liver, specifically targeting a **liver-brain-fat axis** that regulates fat burning, digestion, and energy.

According to the research behind it, many people (especially over 35) have a **sluggish liver** that can‚Äôt process fat and toxins effectively. This leads to:

* **Slow metabolism**
* **Stubborn belly fat**
* **Low energy and fatigue**
* Hormonal imbalances that cause weight gain

HepatoBurn is designed to **reactivate your fat-burning metabolism by optimizing liver function** with natural, research-backed ingredients.

# HepatoBurn Ingredients ‚Äì What‚Äôs Inside?

This is one of the reasons I felt safe trying it ‚Äî the formula is **clean, natural, and well-dosed**.

Key ingredients include:

* **Cynomorium Songaricum Extract** ‚Äì a rare herb that supports liver detox and metabolism (used in traditional medicine for centuries)
* **Cistanche Deserticola** ‚Äì promotes fat-burning and energy by improving liver efficiency
* **Alpha-GPC** ‚Äì boosts brain-to-liver communication and helps regulate metabolic functions
* **Turmeric Root Extract** ‚Äì known for its anti-inflammatory and liver-cleansing effects
* **Milk Thistle** ‚Äì supports liver regeneration and detox
* **Schisandra Berry** ‚Äì a powerful adaptogen that protects liver cells and enhances fat breakdown

There are **no stimulants**, **no caffeine**, **no synthetic fillers**, and it‚Äôs **GMP-certified** and made in the USA. Plus, it's **non-GMO and gluten-free**.

""Drinking from My Saucer"" by John Paul Moore

I‚Äôve¬†never made a fortune and it‚Äôs probably too late now.

But I don‚Äôt worry about that much, I‚Äôm happy anyhow.

And as I go along life‚Äôs way, I‚Äôm reaping better than I sowed.

I don‚Äôt have a lot of riches, and sometimes the going‚Äôs tough.

But I‚Äôve got loved ones around me, and that makes me rich enough.

I thank God for his blessings, and the mercies He‚Äôs bestowed.

I‚Äôm drinking from my saucer, ‚ÄôCause my cup has overflowed.

I remember times when things went wrong, my faith wore somewhat thin.

But all at once the dark clouds broke, and the sun peeped through again.

So God, help me not to gripe about the tough rows that I‚Äôve hoed.

I‚Äôm drinking from my saucer, ‚ÄòCause my cup has overflowed.

If God gives me strength and courage, when the way grows steep and rough.

I‚Äôll not ask for other blessings, I‚Äôm already blessed enough.

And may I never be too busy, to help others bear their loads.

Then I‚Äôll keep drinking from my saucer, ‚ÄòCause my cup has overflowed.

## Key Features Analysis

The market for commercial hot water dispensers offers a wide range of models, each with its own set of specifications. This analysis delves into the core features that differentiate these dispensers and contribute to their overall performance.

**Tank Capacity:** A larger tank capacity translates to fewer refills and a greater ability to meet high-demand periods.

Commercial hot water dispensers typically range from 1.5 gallons to over 5 gallons in tank capacity. Larger businesses, such as cafeterias or large office buildings, will benefit from dispensers with tank capacities of 3 gallons or more. These units can provide a continuous supply of hot water for extended periods without needing frequent refills. Smaller offices or restaurants may find that a 1.5 to 2 gallon capacity is sufficient for their needs.

**Temperature Control:** Precise temperature control ensures optimal results for various applications, from brewing delicate teas to preparing instant coffee.

Advanced models offer adjustable temperature settings, allowing users to select the ideal temperature for specific beverages or tasks. This feature is particularly useful in environments where different types of tea or coffee are served.Dispensers with digital temperature displays and precise temperature control provide a more consistent and accurate hot water supply compared to models with fixed temperature settings.The temperature range typically spans from 175¬∞F to 212¬∞F, allowing for customized water heating.

**Dispensing Options:** Different dispensing options cater to varying user preferences and volume requirements.

Some dispensers offer a single dispensing button for continuous flow, while others provide portion control options for pre-set volumes. These portion control options can definitely help reduce water waste and ensure consistent beverage preparation. Touchless dispensing is another increasingly popular feature, promoting hygiene and reducing the spread of germs, especially in high-traffic environments.

**Filtration System:** An integrated filtration system improves water quality and prevents mineral buildup,extending the lifespan of the dispenser.Many commercial hot water dispensers include built-in filtration systems that remove impurities, chlorine, and other contaminants from the water supply. This not only improves the taste and quality of the hot water but also helps prevent scale buildup inside the tank, which can reduce the dispenser's efficiency and lifespan. Filter replacement is usually required every few months depending on water quality and usage.

**Energy Efficiency:** Energy-efficient models can substantially reduce operating costs over time.Look for dispensers with energy-saving features such as insulated tanks and on-demand heating. Insulated tanks help maintain water temperature, reducing the need for frequent reheating. On-demand heating only heats the water when it's needed, further minimizing energy consumption. Energy Star certified models meet stringent energy efficiency standards and can help businesses save money on their electricity bills.**Material and Durability:** robust construction ensures long-term reliability and resistance to wear and tear.

Commercial hot water dispensers are typically constructed from stainless steel or high-quality plastic.Stainless steel is more durable and resistant to corrosion,making it a better choice for high-use environments. The construction materials and build quality directly impact the dispenser's lifespan and ability to withstand the demands of a commercial setting.

The long-term cost savings can offset the initial investment in a higher-quality, energy-efficient dispenser.

**Consistent Hot Water Quality:** Precise temperature control ensures that water is always heated to the optimal temperature for various applications. This consistency is particularly important for brewing delicate teas and coffees, where temperature can significantly impact the flavor and aroma. Reliable temperature control allows businesses to deliver a consistently high-quality product to their customers.

I was supposed to be making a customer‚Äôs coffee, but the sight in front of me made my eyes itch. 

It was incredibly distracting. 

Parish, our bright-eyed newbie, was across the road, sitting shoulder to shoulder with Juliet, a Golden Grounds girl. She was so perfect, and that was exactly why he was in danger. 

Blonde curls, a heart-shaped face, and a smile with too many teeth. 

Golden Grounds Coffee was our rival, and 
they were painfully beautiful.

I‚Äôd made the mistake of becoming infatuated with one of their guys. Jet. 

Light brown curls. Perfect jawline. A smile that made me melt.

Oh, I was so close to falling into that asshole‚Äôs trap.

Second Street Coffee, where I'd worked for the last year, was known for its secret recipe. Not even we knew what made our coffee so rich, so sweet, so perfect. 

Jet didn‚Äôt want me. He wanted the formula. So, our *date* was a kidnapping. 

I watched Juliet and Parish get closer, leaning into each other. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize I was pouring boiling water all over my hand until the customer squeaked, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam! Oh god, are you all right?‚Äù

I nodded with a smile. But that bitch fucking stung. 

I only had to shoot a glance at Bateman, who was cleaning tables. 

Bateman was my age, cute, the sunshine of our group, always smiling and cracking jokes. With everyone but me. Instead, I got the silent treatment. 

His bright red mop of hair made him a standout. 

But now he was silent, dark eyes glued to Juliet and Parish across the road. 

He straightened up, pulling off his apron just as Juliet stood with a suggestive smirk and dragged our oblivious colleague down the street. A shiver ran down my spine. No doubt back to their turf.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a goner,‚Äù Bateman muttered, arms folded over his chest. He caught my eye, and my cheeks burned. 

Bateman had been a dick since, while drugged with a truth serum, I‚Äôd spilled several of our secrets. That included our manufacturing chain and the codes to several storage containers holding valuable assets. I was rescued, but ever since, Bateman couldn‚Äôt look me in the eye.

It was one time, and he still couldn't forgive me. 

I was one of their best! 

He was a twenty-three-year-old man-child. 

‚ÄúIf they do to him what they did to you, he‚Äôll squeal like a fucking pig.‚Äù Bateman grabbed his jacket from the back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go get him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll come with you,‚Äù I said. When he raised a brow, I shrugged. ‚ÄúI was the one who let Parish go.‚Äù

Bateman grunted, throwing me my coat. ‚ÄúJust stay out of my way,‚Äù he said, lightly dragging me out into the night.

When we stepped into Golden Grounds, the place was empty. 

Juliet greeted us with a wide smile, and something in me snapped. 

Bitch. I stayed close to Bateman. 

She knew exactly what she was doing. Taking Parish was just bait. 

She was leading us straight into their hands.

Juliet leaned across the counter, resting her chin on her fist. ‚ÄúSecond Street,‚Äù she said casually, adding our names, a hint of venom in her tone. ‚ÄúLia.‚Äù She nodded at me, eyes flicking to Bateman. ‚ÄúNoah.‚Äù 

Her smile tightened. 

I had no doubt they had history. I wasn't the first to fall under their spell. 

Bateman was one of the first. He didn't like to talk about it, but, yes, *he* was almost a goner--- and from the look on Julie's face, she still *wanted* my colleague. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúParish,‚Äù Bateman growled. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù

Juliet‚Äôs smile stretched wider. ‚ÄúI have no idea you're talking about.""

She barely had time to raise her hands before Bateman pulled his gun and shot her point blank. In a blink, he vaulted over the counter, grabbed the nearest coffee, took a gulp, and spat it out.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here,‚Äù he gasped. I already knew what was in the coffee. ‚ÄúParish.‚Äù He shot two other baristas and spun to me, wild-eyed. ‚ÄúFind him. I‚Äôll deal with them.‚Äù

I nodded and headed deeper into Golden Grounds. I knew where to go, down the same stone-cold stairs they had dragged me a year ago. When I first met Jet, I thought he was just beautiful. 

Effortlessly, hauntingly pretty. 

But then he pulled me into their place of worship, a pool room filled with red sludge laced with coffee, and I noticed his teeth were just a little too sharp.

Now, stepping into that room again, I saw him. Jet, holding Parish‚Äôs decapitated body in his arms. I watched as he teetered on the pool‚Äôs edge, and dropped him in. I staggered back. 

When I was brought down, I had a choice; a gunshot to the head, or jumping in myself. 

The transformation was fast. Parish sank beneath the bubbling, blood-dark coffee and rose again, not even a minute later, flawless. Perfect. 

Jet observed the transformation, before lifting his head, baring a grin, elongated teeth flashing. ‚ÄúLia,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúNice to see you again.‚Äù

I had no choice. I lowered my gun and made a run for it.

Bateman was waiting for me. All I had to do was shake my head.

His expression crumpled, but we got out of there.

Parish was one of them now, and we had to deal with another loss.

The next day, I was serving coffee when Juliet stepped through the door.

With a simple smile, she snapped Bateman‚Äôs neck, her hands around his throat before we even realized she was there. Bateman dropped to the ground, and I stiffened. There was a gun under the counter, but I wasn't close enough. 

Jet, and a newly turned Parish stood in the doorway, blocking the exit. 

Rosie was in the back, and Carlisle was getting high. 

Neither of them were good shots. 

Juliet came nose to nose with me. Her smile brightened. ‚ÄúIf you want to save him, bring him to us and we‚Äôll talk.‚Äù Her lips found my ear, breath tickling it. 

‚ÄúSecond Street humans,‚Äù she hummed, ducking and scooping Bateman into her arms. He was limp, arms dangling. 

But Juliet finally had exactly what she wanted. Her smile was pure *ecstasy*. 

‚ÄúYou have just declared *war*.‚Äù

She stepped back, throwing Bateman over her shoulder. Juliet turned and strode to the door, joining the others.

Many here probably can connect to this feeling, sadly. 

I felt that it was super physical as well, even the anxiety and social anxiety. Like it wasn‚Äôt me. I‚Äôve been trying everything the last 3.5 years and this time, I felt so angry at all of this that I decided to combine a bunch of things and just see what happens. 

It‚Äôs only been about 3 weeks but I‚Äôve been having really clear moments with friends where I felt like my ‚Äúold‚Äù self, was making people laugh, I felt ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and present again. Which happened sometimes, but not as often and clear as now. As if my body is feeling more grounded. Also, I still have bad moments but the ratio has improved quite a lot! If anyone has additions to what I‚Äôm doing, feel free to lmk so we can combine our methods! Especially the dizziness is still there.

First off I quit strong stimulants like coffee and switched to green tea and matcha, I‚Äôm now taking in the morning. I have issues exercising with PEM so I can‚Äôt do cardio but have started to slowly build a yoga/pilates routine. I‚Äôll do anywhere between 8 and 25 minutes of gentle yoga/pilates 2 or 3 times a week and it‚Äôs really been more helpful than i thought. I also stopped drinking to overcome my anxiety in social situations and been sober the past month. 

I started taking L-tyrosine, L-theanine and CBD oil in the morning. Also started up again with vitamins and supplements, such as b, c, d, NAC, quercitin, nattokinase, ubiquinol, omega 3 and a bunch of others. Can let you know if you‚Äôre interested.

In the evening i take anti histamines (loratadine and cetirizine), 10mg quetiapine (which is also anti histamine), valerian root and melatonin.

I‚Äôve noticed a big difference!

Does anyone else get annoyed/frustrated/angry about how people handle their pregnancies? 

So context: I have had 2 miscarriages. And during the second pregnancy from the moment I got the positive test at 10DPO I tried to do everything perfectly. I stopped drinking coffee, ate my Whole Foods, did more walking (but slowly). I told myself I will do anything to protect my baby because I know how badly I felt about my first miscarriage and how I blamed myself. Unfortunately no matter how perfect I was it still ended in miscarriage. But I see women talking about eating deli meat, having a glass of women, raw fish, etc during their pregnancies and I get so mad. I know the chance of listeria is slim to none but I wouldn't take the chance because I can't live with the potential that I may have hurt my baby. So watching other women do it is infuriating. Especially since even though they weren't ""perfect"" they go on to have healthy babies. I don't wish miscarriage on them ( please don't think that's what I'm saying).

Well she works but its whenever her bosses want her to every few months, just to buy herself little things bc she feels bad I pay for everything, she wants to do her part I guess. We've gone traveling before and had similar problems. Were in our early to mid 20s (she's younger only by a year) Shes very smart and bright when it comes to planning things and paperwork, and just knows her way around through an argument to come out on top( I like it when she does it to others, but not when we have arguments lol)

Main story: Were planing a trip somewhere cold in south America, as we‚Äôre finally beginning to pack there's a jacket that I grab, that I enjoy wearing when the climate is cool. I've had it for about 4 years, it's almost my staple jacket for winter time its a banana republic jacket, it isn't the warmest but it definitely can be layered. Anyways, she began to say that I'm not taking that, and hung it back up‚Ä¶ we repeated this 4+ times. Then she raised her voice trying to snatch the jacket of my hands repeating you're not taking it, ‚Äúits not a warm jacket‚Äù ‚Äúthen you'll have to leave your shoes behind‚Äù (I'm taking 4 shoes for different events and activities she's referring to some casual brown shoes).

While this is happening I'm thinking ‚ÄúI'm paying for this entire trip for me to not take what I want to take?‚Äù ‚ÄúShes over reacting‚Äù ‚Äúshe's acting childish‚Äù
I think I'm a fairly patient person, I just held on to my jacket in a calm tone repeating ‚ÄúI'm taking it, I like it, I want to take it‚Äù eventually she walks away grabs some clothes she was planing to take, hangs it back up and tells me she's not going on the trip, and says you can take someone else. That upsets me a little, so I just go off to the kitchen to make me a coffee.

Aitah for thinking she should back off a bit? I'm letting her plan the trip, take what she wants, plan what she wants, basically plan all my other outfits and I can't take 1 jacket?

I got normal office job in tech company. My job is focusing fixing users' problem, make sure the software is safe for users.
Okay salary, good benefits.

But might be toxic working environment. 

- Managers keep changing the policy rules which narrow down the flexibility in shifts and holiday.

- KPI more and more. Sometimes we feel like we are just numbers.

- When the performance review season is coming, people are trying to report at each other with tiny issues, to get some extra points.

- No one cares about team-work spirit anymore.

- If you are excited about improvements and ideas, you have to go through many layers of approval. Then it might be rejected. And one day it appears as someone else's idea.

- If the managers got investigation from Employee Union, they will say that everyone makes mistake and they will adjust their managing style. But they has been saying same thing like that for 10 years without changes.

(*) Coffee shop

I am helping take care of a small coffee shop in weekend for a person in the neighbor area.

Everyone comes with order and say thank you when they left. Some funny stories everyday, some jokes, smiles all the time.

The most important thing, if I follow the business rules, no one will breathe against my neck to ask for more and more. 

They dont expect a normal employee to change the world and be the superman. 

==> My take-away notes and questions:

- I know that we can not fairly compare an office job to a coffee shop job because they are different on several aspects.
But it feels like office workers, (majorily) in tech area,  spend a lot of energy and effort to improve the system has big impacts on consumers but got no respect much from employers.
Is the employers getting more and more greedy and toxic?

- Is that lacking of true human connection in the office working environment drives people burn out easily?

- I honestly feel so lost and robotic in my office job. Just wanna note down some words, hoping to get more insights from people.

I also trained another barista who unfortunately didn't work out. When I'm not working with her, I'm all by myself most days (5:30AM-4:30PM). People often ask if I'm the owner and I say no, I'm the manager, because my responsibilities fall under a managerial role rather than simply a barista. I do several other things regarding inventory and calculations. 

I would consider myself a manager, not a hiring manager but definitely store manager considering I'm supervising and maintaining the store/ building upon our current facet of what we do. I took a massive pay cut when I started because I was passionate about the industry and thought it was a good place to start considering it's a new business. My boss however just made it clear he would not consider me a manager because I don't do the ordering like he does. Am I out of bounds for wondering why my title is the same as someone with significantly less responsibility and skill? 

As a sidenote, my boss is not from America and the pay setup is also very questionable. I've tried to talk with him about it but he's not receptive. He takes most of my other feedback and implements it but I'm feeling kind of used for all that I do. I don't want a raise either, just the acknowledgement that I do more than the other employee and I am 2nd in command. I love this job and the potential growth but I'm feeling super down about all of it right now. Am I wrong?",2,1748113538.0,barista,4,1.0,False

Be kind. feedback welcome.","My first job sitting in front of a computer screen all day was in the year 2000.¬†

Now, I‚Äôve heard it said somewhere that nothing magical or transcendent is going to happen to you in your life by looking at a screen. And while I mostly agree with this sentiment, life can surprise us sometimes. In the last few decades or so we started experiencing everything through screens. In our living rooms, then later through the ones on our desks, then more recently the little ones in our pockets. Hell, you‚Äôre probably reading this on one of them right now‚Ä¶¬†¬†

But I digress. I‚Äôm gonna try to tell a story.¬†

I was twenty years old and struggling to escape my small town after the death of my best friend and the subsequent 2-year bender I‚Äôd been on. I convinced my then-girlfriend that we needed to get out. Somewhere far away. As luck would have it, around the same time her brother came down to visit from Boston and expressed that he might be able to get me an interview for some low-level position in a software company where he worked. I jumped at the chance, aced the interview and was packing my things for Boston in no time.¬†

In my world and especially at this time, having a ‚Äúcomputer job‚Äù felt exhilarating. Not only could I learn a lot, but also could chat with people and fuck around on the internet while doing my job. Back before social media destroyed basic human decency, people used to meet strangers this way. I talked to everyone, dozens of people from all over the world. ICQ was an international chat messenger that could randomly link you up with any user and I was a junky. Bookish and quiet as I was in real life, the internet was the one place where I had some game.¬†

One day, upon coming back from my lunch break, I was met with three words.

* ‚ÄúTalk to us‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù, I typed.¬†

* ‚Äú2 girls from Poland‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what they say about Polish girls, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I can‚Äôt even remember what I followed it up with. It didn't matter. They were instantly intrigued.¬†

Ewa (Eva) and Ania were just high school girls looking to improve their English, and so I indulged them. I was a proficient online flirt. Ewa, just the right mix of intelligent and demure, cracked me up. We chatted almost every day.

Eventually things in Boston, and thus my computer job and my relationship with my girlfriend, didn‚Äôt pan out. I wanted to stay, build a new life up there despite the insane cost of everything and she missed home.¬†

And so little more than a year after I left, I found myself back at my uncle‚Äôs construction company in New Jersey, tail between my legs, lifting heavy shit all day and coming home in dirty clothes. There I was, warming a barstool in my hometown and wondering if I‚Äôd ever get out again. All around me, the clutches of small town life‚Ä¶ the local watering hole with all the usual suspects‚Ä¶ made me feel like the walls were closing in on me. My chat sessions with Ewa had turned into 2 or 3 emails a month; I logged on every so often to check in with her.¬†

At about the same time, I started working with Grover.¬†

Now, to go into all the details of how exquisitely weird he is would take many pages and a whole story, so suffice it to say that he was a disruptor of things. The year previous, while I was trying on a buttoned-up, business-casual lifestyle in Boston, he‚Äôd schlepped his gangly ass across Europe all by himself‚Ä¶ staying in hostels and hanging out with expat trust-fund babies. He filled my head with all kinds of stories. We‚Äôd spend all day in a truck working alongside each other, and every day he goaded me.¬†

* ‚ÄúEurope, bro! Europe! We gotta go! Sleep in hostels! Meet some European girls‚Ä¶ see some amazing shit!‚Äù¬†

The teenage bookworm in me had read about and romanticised the idea of visiting Europe for years, but such things seemed above my station in life. This was my chance to finally see it. While I didn‚Äôt exactly have all the money, Momma raised me with enough good sense to pay my bills and develop a good credit history‚Ä¶ so I could put it on my card. Was it worth the debt?¬†

Whatever reservations I might have had about the whole thing were washed away in an instant by Grover‚Äôs sage advice:¬†

* ‚ÄúLook man, I know it‚Äôs easier said than done‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ but trust me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs easier done than regretted (later in life).‚Äù¬†

Ok not exactly grammatically correct, but the man had a point.

So we worked, we planned, saved a bit of cash, eventually bought a rail pass and flights‚Ä¶ all the while hyping each other up for it. I told Ewa about our plans and she invited us to come to Poland, but that wasn‚Äôt on the agenda. Poland? Maybe someday, but we had better and more important destinations in mind. Hell, at that time I‚Äôm not sure I could have found it on a map.

April arrived. Go time.

First stop - Amsterdam.¬†

To say that it was everything I‚Äôd imagined would be understating it. Amsterdam is a gem. Spring had arrived and the buds on the trees were glowing a pale green that seemed to complement every canal-lined avenue. The buildings and streets and coffee shops were, to my American mind, something straight out of a movie. I must have looked like a total geek.¬†

*Four middle-aged women sitting in a cafe on their lunch break, smoking a spliff‚Ä¶ Beautiful girls pedalling past us on old, junky bicycles‚Ä¶ Walking through the red-light district at night, looking down a narrow alleyway, wondering what the soft, red glow of those windows might reveal once you were standing directly in front of them‚Ä¶ tripping on mushrooms in the park... the cold realization that it‚Äôs completely obvious to the entire world that you‚Äôre a tourist, and an American one at that.*¬†

These vignettes exist, somewhere in the old shoebox of my memory, as blurry snapshots‚Ä¶ far more of them than can be recounted here, so I‚Äôll keep this relatively short.

After three or four revelrous days, it was onward to Paris.

The sheer size of it was overwhelming. Arriving by train, we had to trudge across the entire city to find the hostel we were looking for from the *Frommer‚Äôs Europe on 70$ a day* guidebook - the ‚Äòbackpacker‚Äôs bible'. Any romantic notions I‚Äôd had about the city were rapidly fading. Unlike Amsterdam, it wasn‚Äôt very walkable. Apart from the child-like wonder of seeing the Eiffel Tower in the distance, I remember almost nothing about that day, just that we were exhausted when we finally settled into our little hostel.

At around midnight, still awake and reading my book and excited for the following day, Grover walked up to me.¬†

* ‚ÄúHey, I gotta get the fuck out of here.‚Äù, he said.

At first I thought he was already sick of France or something and wanted to move on to Barcelona, step three.¬†

I muttered something along the lines of - ‚Äúbut we just got here today‚Ä¶?‚Äù¬†

* ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù, he interrupted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home.‚Äù¬†

While I was reading, he had called his mother and found out that she‚Äôd just decided to sell his childhood home in the next two weeks. We had three weeks left in our trip.¬†

‚ÄúWhaaaat‚Ä¶ the fuck dude?‚Äù¬†

Panic washed over me like a cold shower. Truth be told, at that moment I wanted to leave with him. It was my first time outside of my country and I was terrified. What I said next is lost to my memory. I‚Äôm sure I was sputtering justifications about why I should also leave, but was cut off by my friend -¬†

* ‚ÄúYou should stay.‚Äù¬†
* ‚ÄúHere - ‚Äù, he said, shoving the ‚Äòbible‚Äô into my chest‚Äô*,* ‚Äú - take it.¬† Have your own adventure.‚Äù¬†

What is one to do in this situation?¬†

That night, sleep didn‚Äôt come easy. The upside to traveling alone is that you have no one to answer to. There are no debates about what to eat, what to see or where to go, but it's incredibly lonely. The plan we had outlined was to see Paris then go on to Barcelona, then Rome.. then home. I could change the plan to whatever I wanted. I wish I could tell you that at this moment I let go of all my inhibitions and leaned into the possibilities and plotted a fearless journey into the ether, engaging every smiling face and shaking every hand. That certainly crossed my mind. But this ain't no fairy tale. I wasn‚Äôt that guy.¬†

Was it fear of being alone that kept me thinking about the only person on the entire continent that I knew? Was it a sense of adventure? Something else?

I woke the next morning with a few clear goals in my head. First was to find an internet cafe and make contact with Ewa. I told her what had happened.¬†

* ‚ÄúDoes this mean that you‚Äôre coming to Poland?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù, I replied. ‚ÄúI need time to think about it. Is the invitation still open?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs back up a bit. A few years prior to this whole story, my mother had walked into a casino in Atlantic City and won a ‚Äòdoor prize‚Äô - an all-expenses paid trip for two to Munich, Germany. The trip of a lifetime for my mom, who had hardly traveled beyond New Jersey.¬† She‚Äôd spent the time afterward regaling me with stories of how magical and fairy-tale-like it all was. ‚ÄúYou *have to* see it!!‚Äù¬†

Munich *was* in the right direction, after all. Right?¬†¬†

More blurry snapshots. *A French toddler riding his scooter up to me and asking me something, my reply ‚ÄúJe ne comprends pas le fran√ßais‚Äù, and the scrunched up look on his face ‚Ä¶ thinking to myself ‚ÄúTHAT is the Mona Lisa?! It‚Äôs the size of a fucking stamp!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ getting lost in the Metro and asking for help from a woman who could barely contain her chuckling at my horrible French. she was warm, nonetheless‚Ä¶ the elevator ride through the massive, imposing guts of the Eiffel Tower‚Ä¶ a train ride through Bavaria which, indeed, is like a fairy tale.*

Munich.

As the train pulled in it was getting dark. I had no idea where I was going to sleep. Panicking, I found a tourist info center to ask where the nearest hostel was. I would have killed for the little pocket screen to tell me where to go. That world hadn‚Äôt been invented yet.

A mid-40s German woman greeted me as I walked into her little office. The nearest hostel? Two blocks away. I then asked her how I might get to Prague, another waypoint between me and Ewa. Looking back, I may not remember what this woman looked like, but I‚Äôll always remember what she said.¬†

* ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù ... ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your final destination?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve got this invitation from a person I met online to stay with them in Poland. Like, a regular Polish family.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not sure if you want to go?‚Äù

I shrugged ‚Ä¶¬†

* ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I don't *really* know this person. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm sure I would offer *them* if they were coming to me in America. Ya know? It feels a little weird.‚Äù

There was something in the way she looked at me. Was she sizing me up?¬†

* ‚ÄúI think you should go.‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll be surprised.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

Her smile and nod were all the confirmation I needed.

And that was it. I was in.¬†

At the hostel, the clerk told me that he was all booked up, but that if his reservation didn‚Äôt arrive in the next twenty minutes then I could have a bed. I waited and silently prayed. In hindsight, it was funny but at the time I must have looked like a frightened rabbit. Unable to speak the language and not knowing where you are going to lay your head at night can be pretty intense. But they never came, so I got the bed. Giddy, I threw my backpack on top of it and went straight down to the bar.¬†

Walking into the crowded pub area, the only available seat was at a small table where a cute girl was sitting.¬†

‚ÄúDo you mind if I sit here?‚Äù¬†

* ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ please.‚Äù, she motioned for me to sit.¬†

After an agonizingly long time ‚Äúreading my book‚Äù I mustered up the courage to talk to her.¬†

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ where are you from?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúNew Jersey. What about you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGet the fuck outta here‚Ä¶ I‚ÄôM from New Jersey!‚Äù

Serendipity is a funny thing. We decided to stick together and do touristy stuff. Bike trips and museums and eating out. Evenings in the pub with the beautiful Danish bartender and the old Eurotrash dude who‚Äôs far too old to be hanging out here but unable to stay away from the college backpacker girls. Some sisters from Australia. A cast of characters as colorful as any circus, or maybe that‚Äôs just what my booze-addled brain kept telling me. I had a blast. I was finding my feet.¬†

*A moment of clarity in my drunken pub haze, a feeling of being untethered, young, alive, a stranger in a strange land and relishing it‚Ä¶ ¬† ‚ÄúUp ahead we‚Äôre going to see a nude beach on the riverbank. But don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt see anything too risque. You‚Äôre more likely to see reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt drink beer and eat sausages for 60 years‚Äù‚Ä¶ the stark outline of the letters ARBEIT MACHT FREI relieved against the overcast sky at Dachau, and the sad choir of Israeli students singing at the incinerators‚Ä¶ the seating area at the Hofbrau house, just pick a seat and strike up conversation with whoever is there, the way the world should be‚Ä¶ someone giving me a little card with the name of a Prague hostel on it, The Clown and what?*

Arriving in Prague was a bit of a shock, like I had traveled back in time another 20 years or more. It lacked the pastel, Bavarian quaintness of Munich. It seemed far more brutalist and dingy to me. *This* was Eastern Europe. I couldn‚Äôt escape the thought that only a dozen years or so had passed since Communism collapsed.¬†

It began downpouring as soon as my train pulled into the city. Heavy, sideways rain. Briskly walking out of the train station and trying to find a taxi, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. Was someone following me? ‚Ä¶ Uh huh.¬†

I began shucking and jiving through the kiosks outside the train station to throw him off. A young gypsy perhaps? He was right behind me every step of the way and gaining on me. Seeing the glass doors of the train station up ahead, I immediately ducked back inside the station and spun around to look through the glass and lock eyes with him. He jumped back like something had bit him. I pointed my finger at him as he snapped his head away and tried to look innocent.¬†

Crossing the station to the other side, I ran to a parked taxi. ‚ÄúThe Clown and Bard?‚Äù, I said as I handed the card to the driver.¬†

At this point in the trip the combination of the non-stop rain, the close call with a thief at the train station and the loneliness of solo travel had started to catch up with me. I was feeling tired and just a bit depressed.¬†

The entrance to the place was on the street, but you had to walk down into a basement pub area, check-in, then go upstairs to find a bed. I seemed to be the only person in the whole place for a while, until early in the evening the bar began to fill up. As I sat reading my book, a few guys walked up to my table and asked if they could sit with me.¬†

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù¬†¬†

They were black, which was something that seemed out of place in eastern Europe. They seemed a bit shady, didn‚Äôt say much to me or each other, so I ignored them. After a short while, one of them leans over to me and says,¬†

* ‚ÄúHey man‚Ä¶ you smoke?‚Äù and gives me the international gesture for smoking a joint.

‚ÄúYeah, sure.‚Äù, I hadn‚Äôt smoked since Amsterdam.¬†

* ‚ÄúYou wanna go outside and smoke with us?‚Äù¬†

My mind raced‚Ä¶ ‚Äò*here we go*‚Äô, I thought ‚Äò*I‚Äôll go outside and the first thing I‚Äôll feel is a sucker-punch to my ear*.‚Äô¬† But I didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and a joint sounded like just what I needed.¬†

‚ÄúGive me a second.‚Äù, I said, and instantly ran up the stairs to my bed and put away all my money and my passport. I came back.

* ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù¬†

I braced for a scuffle as I walked outside, literally held my breath‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ nothing. The guy lit up a joint and passed it to me, cool as can be. Turns out he lived there. He and his boys were in a reggae band and his wife was Czech. They‚Äôd come there for movie night, when all the locals pile in and hang out with the backpackers to watch a movie on the giant pull-down projector screen. That night was the first time in my life I‚Äôd ever seen *Monty Python‚Äôs Meaning of Life*, and it was truly a gift to get to watch it with a group of complete strangers, laughing our asses off in unison.¬†

All this time, I‚Äôd been keeping a rough correspondence with my Polish friend, updating her on what I was doing and the progress I was making. She‚Äôd agreed to meet me after Prague. Somehow, I managed to buy tickets to her small city in Poland. I say somehow because the language barrier was pretty insurmountable and the trip wasn't exactly easy to plot out.¬† After two days, I decided Prague was a wash‚Ä¶ the rain wouldn‚Äôt stop and the idea of sloshing around through it all day just seemed like it would make me even more depressed. I just wanted to get on to my destination. *I‚Äôll see it another day*, I thought. On my last night I went out to a shitty club with a few people that mostly bored me. Or maybe I bored them?¬†

*The trains looked like something straight out of 1984, Slavic graffiti all over the outside, upholstered seats that were clearly older than I was‚Ä¶ a disturbing 2-hour delay at the border, German shepherds sniffing through the baggage‚Ä¶ a stopover in Katowice, rushing around asking everyone ‚ÄúDo you speak English?‚Äù, every single person shaking their head and shrugging‚Ä¶ holding up a little hand-drawn note with Gliwice on it‚Ä¶ aha! I‚Äôm saying it wrong! It‚Äôs Glee-vee-tsuh‚Ä¶ Is this the right train*

I finally arrived in Gliwice.¬†

When I walked out of the train station, it was getting dark and nobody was waiting to meet me.¬†

Surely something was wrong. Ewa had agreed to meet me when my train arrived. Where was she?

It was then that I realized that I hadn't gotten her phone number or address. Our sole form of communication had been through email. What kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn‚Äôt have their phone number or address?¬†

Yep. Me.

I scanned the area outside the train station looking for any sign of an internet cafe, but the likelihood of finding one seemed impossible. This was a small city, a town really, in my mind. I noticed a girl sitting there on a bench and pantomimed my way through an explanation about what I was doing there and how royally fucked I was. She could do little more than politely smile at me before she left. I decided to wait.¬†

After what felt like an eternity, a car pulled up in the parking lot, and a familiar face stepped out of the passenger side.¬†

We hugged.¬†

Upon entering the car, her older sister Ola immediately asked.

* ‚ÄúWhat kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn‚Äôt have their phone number or address?

It turned out that the delay at the border made my train late. They had already been to the train station and waited for me and left. They decided to come back to check again. The Fates were looking out for me.¬†

What can I say about those first awkward days in this place? Ewa proved to be much quieter and more reserved than I ever imagined. The girl on the screen was nowhere to be found, she‚Äôd been replaced by a mousy introvert who was extremely difficult to read. Thank the gods for her sister, who never seemed to shut up.¬†

They made me feel welcome in their home and fed me. It was a big and lovely house, and I soon realized that her family probably had more money than mine, but the culture shock was substantial. This place lacked all of the luster of my previous destinations. Everything seemed gray and a bit dilapidated, as if the Second World War had only recently ended. This was real Poland, real people. No backpackers and trust fund kids and tourists.¬†

If I'm being honest, I wanted to go home. The girl I‚Äôd come to meet wasn't at all what I had expected. I was convinced that she didn‚Äôt like the person I was beyond the screen, but we‚Äôd made a few plans already and would see them through.

She showed me her city and I met a few of her friends‚Ä¶ we took the train to Krakow, another absolute gem. We walked through its Baroque beauty, fumbled through conversations, discovering more and more about each other. No more screens to hide behind.

I started to do this thing each day, where I said - ‚ÄúI think I have to leave tomorrow.‚Äù

And she‚Äôd say - ‚ÄúDo you *have to*?‚Äù

And I‚Äôd look into her eyes and ask - ‚ÄúDo you *want* me to stay?‚Äù

* ‚ÄúYes‚Äù

So I stayed‚Ä¶ another day. Then another.¬†

I‚Äôll spare you, dear reader, the extremely awkward details, but suffice it to say that I was falling *hard* for this girl.¬†

And since this was my time‚Ä¶ my adventure‚Ä¶ the transmutation of a criminally shy boy into a man unafraid‚Ä¶ I told her so.¬†

It‚Äôs been the defining moment of my life.¬†

Two decades later, here I am plugging away, plotting it all out on a different screen‚Ä¶ in my home‚Ä¶ in Poland‚Ä¶ and yelling at my kids to get off of *their* screens.¬†

So‚Ä¶ If you ever think that you‚Äôll never have a transcendent experience by looking at a screen‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶¬†

1kuj3gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1kuj3gf/people_with_pcos_are_the_biggest_copers_in_the/,People with PCOS are the biggest copers in the world when it comes to losing weight,"You'll find the most common opinion among PCOS-havers online is that 'calories in, calories out' is not actually 100% true and that losing weight with PCOS is incredibly difficult. They'll come out with some bullshit argument involving the words 'insulin resistance' and 'hormonal imbalance' and will definitely talk at some point about having 'horrible metabolism' which means they have a harder time losing weight.

You know what the funny thing is, though? When they finally reveal what DID help them lose weight, it's lists like the following (pulled from a PCOS weight loss post):

""1. I got a medical test to determine how many calories I burned. It was 1486 - over 200 calories less than what my Withings scale had said.

2. Bought a refurbished recumbent bike. I can‚Äôt recommend recumbent bikes enough. They let me be seated and use my laptop and I love it. I also got a cushion from Amazon. The brand of bike is Lifefitness - it‚Äôs is really sturdy and allowed me to watch a bunch of streaming services or use my laptop to get things done - so working out is fun! I bike 90 minutes a day at a zero resistance.

3. I was used to eating a lot and I strategically used caffeine (coffee) as an appetite suppressant while learning how to only eat 1500 calories a day.

4. My stomach shrunk over the course of a month and it became easier to feel full with less. I started slicing 4-5 of those those smaller tender cucumbers and throwing them in a ziploc with rice wine vinegar and soy sauce. After about 5 minutes they‚Äôre really yummy.

5. I also love cherry tomatoes covered in a little rice wine, salt and olive oil.

6. The point is - eating a ton of fiber fills the stomach and creates a sense of fullness with very low calories.

7. For some sweet fiber I love frozen peaches I buy at Wholefoods as a dessert or before bed snack.

8. Avoid calorie dense foods more than I used to. Things like skinless chicken thighs here or there has been fine.

9. Abide by the Japanese principle of only eating until I'm 80% full.""

Hmm... reading this, does anything seem interestingly familiar to you? Here, lets look at a few more quotes:

""I'm 5'1, 130lbs and eating 1150 calories a day. I can't lose weight.""

""I didn't lose weight with just CICO. I had to cut out all sugar completely.""

These people are just a microcosm of the bigger context, but the overall story is the same -- they just do not understand how weight loss works whatsoever and think these 'revolutionary' ideas are anything besides a calorie deficit in a fancy dress. I mean come on... only eating until you're 80% full, eating frozen fruits instead of traditional desserts, cutting fucking sugar, THESE ARE JUST CALORIE DEFICITS.

Yet you still get so many women (and to be honest, guys too, just women with PCOS are the most common culprit) who claim that losing weight is impossible or so much more complicated than just CICO. It's just pure cope and the worst part no one is ready to talk about is that this kind of shit is just gluttony. These guys are always binge eating or secretly eating, and then share their 'impossible to lose weight' story to justify that shit to other people, and all of a sudden you have a society of people overeating. It weighs heavy on the medical field because obese patients have way worse health outcomes and require much more medical attention, and it also weighs heavy on the food industry",0,1748113193.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,17,0.47,False

*****

What began with a Florida teacher grooming his student for an alleged sexual relationship ended with the 16-year-old victim hanging from a tree with rope around her neck.

Former SouthTech Academy AP English teacher Damian Conti was arrested on February 6, 2024, charged with several counts of unlawful sexual activity with a child and as of April 16, a newly added charge of attempting to assist in self-murder, Palm Beach Post reported.

""This case is much more than just the sexual abuse of a minor by a teacher. Some of the most upsetting evidence includes the defendant taking this young girl to the store to buy materials to end her life,"" Alexa Ruggiero, Assistant State Attorney wrote in an email.

According to court documents, the 36-year-old teacher met the girl at Home Depot hours after allegations of abuse were brought to the attention of school officials. He is seen in security footage as his student purchases 30 feet of rope and 15 feet of chain. She told the cashier they were building a treehouse, but told Conti they would commit suicide.

Conti began grooming the girl in August 2023, communicating over school email, text and Instagram. They met near her locker at the end of each school day after he offered to serve as her academic mentor. According to her family, he also took her for coffee, gave her driving lessons, and encouraged her to play on the volleyball team he coached. Soon he was confiding in her with personal information about his work, marriage, and sex life.

According to court documents, the 36-year-old teacher met the girl at Home Depot hours after allegations of abuse were brought to the attention of school officials. He is seen in security footage as his student purchases 30 feet of rope and 15 feet of chain. She told the cashier they were building a treehouse, but told Conti they would commit suicide.

Conti began grooming the girl in August 2023, communicating over school email, text and Instagram. They met near her locker at the end of each school day after he offered to serve as her academic mentor. According to her family, he also took her for coffee, gave her driving lessons, and encouraged her to play on the volleyball team he coached. Soon he was confiding in her with personal information about his work, marriage, and sex life.

By October 2023, he told the victim he ""liked her,"" and began sexually assaulting her in parking lots and on campus. Rumors circulated among students, with an assistant principal issuing a warning to Conti after a TikTok capturing the victim getting into his car spread online.

When another student with access to the victim's Instagram account found ""curious"" messages between the victim and an account seemingly belonging to Conti, he shared screenshots with the principal.

Conti was immediately suspended and the victim was called to the office, where she refused to answer the principal's questions and asked for an attorney. Without notifying her parents, the school allowed the victim to leave campus, at which point she drove to meet Conti and buy materials to commit suicide.

""When they pushed her out, they basically turned her into the hands of the predator,"" her attorney, Victoria Mesa-Estrada, said.

At the store, Conti told the girl he changed his mind about their suicide pact and begged her not to do it. When they ""went their separate ways,"" Conti called his therapist, who insisted he call 911. After half an hour of searching, police found the girl hanging from rope. She was resuscitated and slowly recovered in a pediatric intensive care unit.

Conti was arrested the same day, admitting that his suspension following his sexual relationship with the victim motivated her suicide attempt. ""There was feelings that shouldn't have been there. I should have stopped it,"" he told police.

Prosecutors offered two separate plea deals to Conti, but he rejected both and maintains his innocence. If convicted, he faces life in prison. A trial by jury is scheduled to begin June 23.

In Florida, 16-year-olds can legally consent to a sexual relationship only if the partner is younger than 24-years-old.",1,1748113045.0,WeChooseTheBear,0,1.0,False

The bistro was warm, and I was flush, maybe it was from the cocktail I was nursing so I could spend more time, more time hoping I could find something to say to May or maybe May would say something to me.

It was May and The Paloma was bitter and the bistro was warm. And loud. And it had May.

May had a warm smile, and tattoos, and blonde hair. I liked May's tattoos. They were soft. Unlike the bistro. That was loud and colorful, and full of chatter. 

Maybe one day I'll come back, and May will be here, but it won't be May and I won't be flush, and maybe I'll have done enough rehearsals that I can say something when she spills the coffee next to me, at the bar, nursing my bitter paloma. But May glides and is soft, she won't spill the coffee.

May is almost over, and I don't know if I'll be back and If I do return I won't be dressed for May weather, because it won't be May.

1kuivt2,https://i.redd.it/rbksmzqc0s2f1.jpeg,my stupid tranny life (reposted rant and cleaned up typos),"Extremely bitter in my life as an Autistic Trans Woman, unable to move on

I am a 28 year old going on 29 year old almost 30 year old trans woman. I can say without a doubt, I hate my life beyond what words I can use to describe said hatred on this computer screen. My life has been nothing but agony. I was born relatively normal. A healthy baby boy by all accounts. Grew up the first year of my life, baptized Catholic, normal baby boy, family moves to Kentucky from Jersey to be near my pop pop. Age two problems start, I have speech regression, my milestones fall apart, paddy training etc. Mom takes me to the University of Kentucky doctor. Doctor says (at the time) I have aspergers. Said I'll never walk, talk, ride a bike or have a normal life. My mom puts me in intensive early intervention training. Move to Pennsylvania to be near my cop brother. Realize from a young age I am fucked up. No one wanted to be my friend, inclusion classes the like. Had gender dysphoria from a very young age. Desperately wanted to be a girl. Begged my parents to let me be a girl. Got all the help in the workd for my autism, none for my gender identity. Lived a very isolated childhood, video games raised me. Interests moved away from girl ones because ""those make mom and dad's scream"". Years pass, shit happens, my teen years occur. Again, confront mom and dad. Deeply unhappy and in pain with my changing body. I have puppy dog eyes at the pediatrician while I BEG for life saving gender affirming care. Mom puts her foot down, ""parental rights"" as I stare the doctor in the eyes, tears in my eyes begging for treatment. High school comes, high school goes, reach the age of 18. 

I should have started HRT. I should have got a job and moved out. Extremely emotionally undeveloped and stunted. Spend almost the next 10 years in and out of community college, a year unemployed where my already chunky body ballooned to 306 lbs at 5'11. Hair severely thinned. At 26 mom finally relents and I self advocate, seek out HRT while I returned to college to finish, have a two year associates while most people by then have graduated. I know what you are thinking and will say to my post. ""Comparison is the thief of joy! Everyone is unique! Everyone goes at their own pace!"" then why is my life so shit? How can I make myself feel better and fix my life when there is no frame of reference for comparison? Chugging along I'm still in deep pain, manage to get HRT after one endo denied me and needed a letter from  my psychiatrist, had to take a train TWO HOURS from my shitty tiny home town to the fucking BRONX for my HRT appointment with planned parenthood because I lived in an informed consent black hole, got HRT, 6 months in go through an emotional hell scape, against better judgement move on campus, take a wrecking ball to what little social life I had, after summer end up on psych ward, mom kicks me our, did Marijuana gummies found out THC is basically a psychedelic for me, psychosis, pain 3 weeks without HRT as my body falls apart again. If I didn't have autism I would have  been homeless. Ended up in a shelter, then a respite stay, then shared living, now have an independent autism waiver with ""in home and community"" staff so far up my ass I cant breathe. They have reduced hours but I still have four hours a week of someone I DONT WANT IN MY HOME, in my home to maintain the rent assistance that comes with my autism services. I'm about to lose SSDI because I went over my trial work period. 

I can't find a job because I'm an androgynous fat blob of autism. I have a job as a security guard but this won't pay the amount I need for my surgeries, for my wardrobe to be redone, and to finally have a normal middle class standard of living. Everything feels pointless.

I am 28 going on 29 and I'm in so much massive emotional pain thats turning physical as of late, throbbing headaches, heart palpitations, I binge eat, drink 3 cups of coffee a day, my recent weightloss is about to be undone because my Medicaid stopped covering ozempic. Primary Medicare wouldnt cover it, NOW with Republicans about to pass their ""big beautiful bill"" I'll have to pay out of pocket for hormones while ALREADY on the poverty line, having to work less because earn to much"". I had my balls sliced off in December before Trump became president. I'm almost three years on HRT and I look like shit. Hair came in decently but still has a ""M"" shape. Facial hair still grows, cant consistently voice train because I cant bring myself to do ANYTHING with my goals. I'm not in an environment to voice train, I'm in unbearable amounts of pain. I cry myself to sleep every night, I passively tell my one trans girl friend who is the ONE that sticks with me because I've become a pariah in local trans circles because of my politics, desire to be cis fem and neurotypical, I told her I want to die, that this will eventually kill me. I hate my body, I see a blonde gorilla looking me in the eyes. Everyone hugboxes and say I pass so well. Then why is it, when I put a tshirt and jeans on all of a SUDDEN I'm sir? 

Why do cis girls get to dress down and be girls? I also feel my brain is at war with me because of my masculine interests. Don't tell me they aren't gendered, because when these interests are the MAJORITY of my headspace, when I TRY to do feminine things and recoil in pain and fear because of ot being ""cringe"" and me being an ""invader"" and the only other thing I can think about every day outside the PAIN of my gender, with my obsession with history, is seeing us in the nightmare timeline, the Trump won again timeline, the 4th Reich tineline, the alternative being leftism/anarchism/communism or any OTHER type of ideology I just see Hitler and Stalin looking out from their Graves trying to come back. I feel so much PAIN that literally nothing in my life went right. My gender wasn't right, my mind wasn't right, the family I wanted to be born i to wasn't right, the timeline wasn't right, loterally everything in my life is some sort of extension and pain from the central core.

I was not born a girl, and telling me I already was one, when the ability to make me one does not exist, has created a life of insufferable agony for me.

Yet people say I have ""internalized transphobia"" or ""internalized abelism"" because it hurts their own truth and their comfort of ""positivity no matter the cost""

This will either kill me, or I'll kill myself

1kuiv4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kuiv4y/why_choose_the_frigidaire_efic240_gourmet_ice/,Why Choose the Frigidaire EFIC240 Gourmet Ice Maker Review? Unveiling Its Unique Features!,"The Frigidaire EFIC240 Countertop Artisanal Sphere Ice Machine caught my eye as I searched for a way to elevate my home drinks game. It‚Äôs hard to deny the appeal of perfectly round 2-inch ice spheres in a sleek countertop machine that promises up to 84 spheres a day. After a week of daily use, I decided to spill the, uh, ice cubes on this product‚Äîboth the sparkling merits and those slight drawbacks. 

**Stylish, Compact, and Kitchen-Friendly**  
The ice maker‚Äôs design fits perfectly in my kitchen, and its compact dimensions (16.75‚Äù x 9.76‚Äù x 16.26‚Äù) mean it doesn‚Äôt dominate countertop real estate. The gray color blends nicely, and the transparent window is surprisingly satisfying. I‚Äôve caught myself peeking at the artisanal ice progress more often than I care to admit. It doesn‚Äôt require a water hookup, so all I had to do was plug it in and fill the reservoir. Honestly, it‚Äôs like it was custom-made for smaller kitchens and portable enough to take to gatherings or barbecues.

**Effortless Operation with a Smart Control Panel**  
I appreciated the touch control panel that made ice production feel almost futuristic. It‚Äôs not overly complicated; a few taps and this machine sprang to life, cranking out ice spheres. The first batch hit my glass within 30 minutes, which came as a delightful surprise. Over several days, it consistently made about 84 spheres daily, making it ideal for small parties and those marathon nights I enjoyed sipping whiskey with friends. It even has a self-cleaning function, so keeping it in top shape is practically hassle-free.  

[Ready to snag Frigidaire EFIC240? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dmtznlc7/)  

**Performance in Action**  
One of the standout features for me was the 2-inch round spheres this little beast produced. These gourmet ice spheres are not just for whiskey; I popped them into cocktails, iced coffee, even sparkling water. The melt rate is slower than standard ice cubes, keeping beverages cold longer and diluting them far less. Though it performs well for its size, I noticed a slight hiccup. Occasionally, the machine struggled to keep up during long weekend drink-fests with back-to-back use. I get it‚Äîit‚Äôs doing heavy lifting, but it‚Äôs something to consider.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Produces elegant ice spheres perfect for fine spirits or special occasions.  
- Compact design that fits neatly under most kitchen cabinets.  
- Easy-to-use touch control panel, even for tech-averse folks.  
- Automatic self-cleaning to keep things hygienic and hassle-free.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- A bit of a slow startup, with the first ice batch taking about 30 minutes.  
- Struggles slightly to meet demand during continuous heavy use.  
- Though compact, it‚Äôs not as lightweight as some competing machines.  

**Other Options**  
While this machine has a lot going for it, I did compare it to other sphere ice makers like the GE Profile and the Igloo Sphere Machine. GE‚Äôs unit edged ahead in style and build quality but was priced significantly higher; it also had a slightly smaller ice output. Igloo‚Äôs machine offered similar performance at a competitive price but lacked the self-cleaning feature, which is a dealbreaker for me in terms of hygiene and maintenance. The Frigidaire EFIC240 struck a nice balance between cost, output, and convenience, though it may not be the absolute premium player on the field.

**Quality for Price**  
As someone who likes their drinks to have a touch of luxury without draining the bank account, I see the product as an investment in beverage enhancement. While it‚Äôs not budget-tier, the functionality, daily capacity, and impressive results offer a bang-for-the-buck proposition. For me, the spherical ice alone was enough to justify its place on my counter. If you enjoy hosting or just like your everyday drinks to feel special, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth every penny.

Some context. My husband has watched the movie Anora like 20 times. He works from home and I've come home to him watching it in his office on one of his many monitors (he does data entry and has a big setup). I've noticed it because I saw a scene once that looked like porn--I asked him about it and he said it was from an Oscar-winning movie that's actually very feminist. 

I haven't seen the movie, and him watching it so many times isn't an issue. BUT he does like to place his favorite movie of the moment in our living room just below our TV. That's also not an issue, but this cover is a little explicit, especially with our four year-old running around. I asked him to remove it once (he didn't) and then I asked him to remove it again (he didn't). Finally, I asked him to remove it for Mother's day because our parents were coming over and I found it embarrassing. 

He refused and I took the blu-ray and hid it. I just didn't want to stare at it while we were all having coffee. He flipped out and yelled at me. Demanded I give it back to him. I did eventually, and he put it away for our visit. BUT I'm so pissed that it took all that for him to put this stupid movie away. We're not talking now, and he's sleeping in the office. Am I over-reacting? Is this movie all that feminist? Based on the cover, which feels pretty exploitative, I can't imagine it, but I'm planning on watching it later to see.

1kuiot5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gabormate/comments/1kuiot5/my_journey_with_adhd_from_childhood_compliance_to/,My Journey with ADHD: From Childhood Compliance to Adult Healing,"When I was younger, I was treated for ADHD with Dexedrine. I didn't really understand why people told me I had a problem and needed to take this medication. I went along with it because I wanted my mom to look at me a certain way. I wanted her approval‚Äîsomething I not only chased with her, but with most people in my life. Of course, I didn't realize I was doing that back then. There was no awareness within me of the purpose of the medication, no understanding of what it was meant to address. I was simply a child being told I needed to be fixed, without any real connection to why.

At some point in my late teens, I chose to stop taking prescription medication and began to self-medicate with cannabis. This wasn't just a rejection of medication‚Äîit was an active opposition to the entire pharmaceutical approach. Life seemed to be great for a few years, but eventually big life changes created stress and I didn't know how to deal with the way I was feeling. I didn't really know myself fully... but who does at 21 years old?

After 18 years of raw dogging life, I read a book by Gabor Mat√© called *Scattered Minds*. It's a book about ADHD that approaches it not as a genetic disorder but through the lens of trauma and development. I was already into Mat√© because of his work with compassionate inquiry, a self-inquiry practice that had proven useful for me in debugging difficulties in my life.

The book was eye-opening to say the least. I could clearly see myself in the way Mat√© was articulating people who struggle with the symptoms of ADHD. One example stood out to me in particular‚ÄîI'll paraphrase: Imagine an intersection with a police officer coordinating all the traffic, clearly seeing everything as it approaches and directing it accordingly. For a person with ADHD, it's like that policeman fell asleep. When I heard this example it was a big WHOA moment for me. Up to that point I had been struggling with starting and completing things I felt I wanted to do. I didn't have issues with work, paying bills, or losing things, like others reportedly do, but just with the things I wanted to bring forth from within myself. I would begin a task, and eventually so many thoughts pour into my mind I could not stay focused, I feel overwhelmed by the noise, and I stop what I am working on, and get carried away with whatever other thoughts entered my mind.

What Gabor outlines in *Scattered Minds* about trauma has laid out groundbreaking work in approaching these types of disorders in a way that can lead to real healing. This stands in stark contrast to mainstream science that insists ADHD is genetic and incurable. I beg to differ, and my experience proves it.

After I completed his book, for the first time in so many years, I felt like maybe it would be worth it to give taking some form of medication a try‚Äîbut this time with full awareness and intention. At that point I was still scared to commit to getting a psychiatrist and going the formal route, but I was becoming more open to the idea. I did find a nootropic called phenylpiracetam in a product called ""Absolute Focus"" by Bright Brain. There were some other nootropics in it which all contributed to helping maintain focus.

I gave Absolute Focus a try. The first time I took it, it was before dinner. After dinner my partner and I watched a movie, and I found myself able to work on my computer and watch the movie without trailing off in either direction. I was also exploring a coding framework I had never explored before, and was able to retain what I learned as I moved through the demo. This was something I was not used to. The next morning, I took it before I left and went off on my usual morning routine. When I got to the coffee shop I like to hang out at, and sat down, I realized my head was silent. It felt so clear. This was very strange and I remember thinking to myself, is this how it is for a person that doesn't struggle with these symptoms of ADHD?

One amazing benefit of this quieting of mind was that I become 100% more emotionally present. I could feel my environment much more than usual because I wasn't hearing 100 different streams of thoughts bombard my head.

After 3 or 4 days, I took a day off, amazed at how I had felt I didn't go backwards in terms of my emotional presence or clear headed thinking.

This stuff worked! Well, it worked for SOME symptoms... but not all of them.

Eventually, after some months with this product, I found myself still failing at being able to bring about the things I felt I wanted to. I worked up the verve to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. The crucial difference this time was that I approached medication not as something I was told I needed, but as a conscious choice‚Äîa potential therapeutic tool that I could use alongside my years of self-inquiry practice and NLP training.

She was lovely, and a great listener. She agreed that I do struggle with ADHD symptoms and prescribed me Vyvanse.

The first day taking Vyvanse was something quite remarkable. It was as if the noise and dark cloud that I had not really noticed was hanging over my inner atmosphere was washed away. Before I left the house that morning, I gave my partner a hug, and noticed that I actually felt her put her arms around me, and then realized I do not remember when the last time a hug felt that way. I was totally present. I felt a sense of joy in myself that I seemed to have lost touch with.

Some hours later it seems that the clouds started to return... and I wasn't feeling as great as initially.

But here's where my years of self-work became crucial. After spending a week working with Vyvanse, I began to notice that after the initial 2 hours had passed where it felt like nothing short of a miracle, I would end up engaging in thoughts that were akin to the dark cloud returning. I started to pay more attention. I started to see when a cloud was rolling in, and rather than engage with it, I found myself creating a different picture. The things I would identify with that created me to feel cloudy, I could see they were not true and let them float past.

This process actually allowed me to not feel the medication had stopped working, but rather it turned into a day of flow where I was able to stay with myself, without all the clouds. The medication gave me the space to stop reacting emotionally, which allowed me to detect the underlying triggers for why I had been reacting that way all along.

# The Therapeutic Breakthrough

Over the past five weeks, this process has only deepened. What I've experienced has been nothing short of a miraculous therapeutic benefit. I have healed patterns that have been present in myself for years, peeling back layers of what actually drives me to react the way I do‚Äîand the layers just keep peeling back.

I've been able to catch myself before I react to patterns that contributed to years of stress. I'm able to see clearly WHY I was reacting that way, and by looking and inquiring into what's coming up, I have rewired myself where I do not engage in these behaviors that were causing me stress. I have observed concrete changes to things that once triggered me into reacting a certain way. I've worked through the intense sensations that would come up which I normally would react to because I felt it was going to ultimately affect my safety. When the things that would activate the triggers in myself occur now, it doesn't even phase me.

The coolest part for me isn't just that I have healed these patterns, it's the clarity in seeing the roots of them. This is proof that trauma can be healed and healing it absolutely influences behavioral health. It points directly to where these behavioral problems originate, and rather than having someone believe they have an incurable disorder, we can actually teach people how to address and resolve these issues.

# The Critical Caveat

I never thought I would advocate for medication, but here we are. It might not be for everyone, but it certainly helped me. Though one caveat to this I want to firmly put across is that **I didn't just take the medication‚ÄîI took it and worked on myself**.

I do not at all believe it was solely the medication that created these therapeutic benefits. It was the medication coupled with the training and experience in the application of self-inquiry and NLP that I have under my belt that really has led to the quality of the therapeutic benefits. When things came up, I found myself having a therapy session with myself. The medication doesn't fix you, but it can be a powerful method of therapy when we set our intention that way.

In the years prior to taking the medication, I had learned a lot about myself and about the roots and nature of triggers. I felt equipped to deal with things when they came up. Perhaps the ideal situation for people who choose medication would be to have this awareness. Either working with yourself if you feel equipped, or working with a counselor, coach or therapist, or even both‚Äîthis is how you can get the most out of medication as a form of therapy. A road to true healing, rather than lifelong use of medication.

# A New Paradigm

My journey represents a fundamental shift: from being a child who was medicated without understanding or agency, to an adult who actively opposed pharmaceutical intervention, to finally someone who could approach medication with full awareness, intention, and a toolkit for healing. This isn't about medication compliance‚Äîit's about using every available tool, including medication, as part of a conscious healing journey.

What I want to advocate for is this approach: recognizing that what we call ADHD may have roots in trauma and development, that it can be healed, and that medication‚Äîwhen combined with deep self-work‚Äîcan be a powerful catalyst for that healing rather than a lifelong crutch. We need to teach people how to address and resolve these issues at their root, not just manage symptoms indefinitely.

The difference between taking medication as a child because you're told you're broken and taking it as an adult as part of an intentional healing journey is profound. One reinforces helplessness; the other empowers transformation.",2,1748112107.0,gabormate,0,1.0,False

I've made a post on AITA about this situation once before years ago, right around when this all started. I was a lot nastier about it back then, so when I posted it and explained his issue and my perspective, I was labeled the asshole. It was a humbling experience, and between that and just coming to accept that did have OCD, I tried my best to buck up and be more patient. I tried to talk calmly with him about things, nudge him towards getting help, give him evidence as to why what he was doing was harmful to himself and others, and just generally try and control myself. I'm done with that now. I do not care if I'm the asshole for not supporting him anymore, because I am just done with how he treats me. If I'm the asshole after making this post, then so be it, I'm done.

My brother and I used to have a fairly okay relationship. It was tough to connect like neurotypical siblings might (I wouldn't know, I have ADHD, he has ""high functioning autism"" - though I believe there's a more updated term for it now - and my other brothers have autism with high support needs). We did manage to connect though, with us both loving movies, shows, media, books, etc. Looking back, some of the things he did back then that upset me were just amplified when this shitshow started, but back then I could let them go a lot easier.

Pre-COVID, he lived a generally positive life. He was very interested in theater and wanted to become a professional stage actor/singer, he played sports and was involved in the community. He ate well enough and stayed physically active enough to stay skinny. He kept himself clean, shaving daily, washing his face, got haircuts. He actually looked up to the Amity faction from Divergent because he said they were peaceful and caring, and he wanted to be like that. I remember thinking it was silly, because why wouldn't you want top be Dauntless and cool and tough?

But I digress. We weren't incredibly close, but we were friendly enough to enjoy each other's company. We'd sing in the car to duet songs, we'd sit and watch TV shows together. Arguments we got into tended to just boil down to dumb sibling things - I wanted to watch something but he wanted to watch something else, he/I had something the other wanted, etc.

Then in 2020, it was like he went through this change that completely changed him as a person. The reason was probably a deep anxiety that he had as well as the tendency for people with ASD to take things very literally. When the pandemic hit and we got all this information online about how to keep yourself safe by washing your hands and avoiding touching things like doorknobs or whatever, he took everything too far. At first it was just handwashing. He'd wash his hands a lot more. Then when he did wash his hands, he would wash them for a lot longer. Not just a minute, upwards of 3-5 minutes PER WASH, with the water running the entire time. He'd start to use a lot more soap during these.

It just kept getting worse from there. I went off to college in the next state over starting in 2020, and I would move back home during the breaks, and it continued to get worse. I can't give an exact progression of when he started doing what, but I can give a list of things that I noticed happening and either persisted through today or even got worse.

* Washing his hands excessively through the day, again 3-5 minutes per wash, using a ton of soap. This has led to his hands actually being red and raw from how much he washes them. And there's never a point where he just does a quick rinse, maybe with a little soap - EVERY SINGLE TIME he washes his hands, it is 3-5 minutes with a ton of soap.
* Going through hand soap and body soap incredibly fast. I believe his current record is going through a full bar of Dove body soap in 3 days, though I never kept track of how fast he would burn through a bottle of hand soap. (With this, he also tended to just stash the empty soap boxes and bottles away, so we would find these huge piles of them in the bathroom cabinets).
* Showering 2-3 times per day, upwards of 30-45 minutes per shower. There has been many times I've been made late because he managed to get into the shower before me. Then, there would be absolutely no hot water left. And with his excessive soap usage, I have almost slipped and fell in the shower dozens of times because the tub is so slick after.
* Doing laundry on a near daily basis. He somehow has a near constant rotation of clothes he can throw into the washer, and our mom has apparently caught him changing clothes multiple times per day. This burns not only through our detergent/soap supply, but it wastes an incredible amount of water and electricity, and I can't imagine how bad our dryer vent looks now. Also - if he finishes his laundry and something falls on the floor as he's carrying to where ever he deems ""clean"" (which tends to be in very obstructive places like the couch or the coffee table), he picks it up like it's infected and tosses it back into the hamper. Also he washes his hands after every step of doing his laundry - putting clothes into the washer, changing them to the dryer, then taking them out of the dryer.
* General avoidance of ""dirty"" things. He won't pick up food/objects he drops on the floor, and if asked to, he'll get huffy and hesitate a lot before doing it, then wash his hands after. He avoids touching door handles literally every chance he gets. He won't sit down at the table to eat anymore. He is extremely anxious about the trash bins and will avoid touching them at all costs, even if it's to help take out the trash as a chore. He hates doing the dishes, he doesn't like feed the dogs because their bowls are on the ground. And again, if he is made to do any of this, he will wash his hands after.
* Avoidance and general apathy towards our pets. This sort of plays into the previous one, but I feel it deserves its own segment. We have 2 dogs (a German Shepherd and a Labradoodle), and while they're not the most trained dogs ever, they definitely are not messy. They don't make messes inside beyond exceptional circumstances, they aren't rolling around in poop or dirt outside, they don't lick us a lot, they don't jump up on us unless we allow them, they don't get into the trash, and so on. Generally, in terms of cleanliness and staying out of things they shouldn't be in, they're very good dogs. My brother, however, avoids them like the plague, often doing weird dodges if they pass near him to avoid any part of them touching him, not walking past them if they're in the way, scolding them if they come up to sniff him while he sits, scolding them if they're just in his way at all, not petting them, etc.
* Using an excessive amount of cleaning/household supplies. There has been many times that he maybe spilled something or found a mess, and he would spray it with Lysol to the point that the carpet would be moist or the hard wood would have puddles on it. He could burn through a bottle of disinfectant wipes in a week. He burns through family sized paper towel rolls in 1-2 weeks. He uses ONLY wet wipes for the bathroom, and burns through packs of those very quickly. And again, there's the issue with the soap/detergent.

And here's some other specific examples that I can't put a general label on, but have continued to happen consistently and/or have gotten worse:

* He stashes his personal items like his wallet, phone, belts, books, etc. in obstructive places like the entertainment center, end tables, the coffee table, a downstairs table/bench, and other places, instead of organizing them in places that they would at least be neat and orderly. Not only is it obstructive to other people, it's an eyesore and embarrassing when I have friends over because it makes the house that our mom and myself try very hard to keep tidy look incredibly messy and cluttered.
* He will avoid doing any household chores, because they require touching something on the ground, or picking things up. He won't do yard work anymore because again, he doesn't want to touch anything outside. He will vacuum if asked to - followed by washing his hands.
* He drips so much water on the floor, just everywhere. If he showers, there will often be enormous puddles on the ground that he refuses to wipe up. When he washes his hands, he doesn't shake off the excess water and just lets it drip everywhere in the kitchen without wiping it up.
* He will not use any sink other than the kitchen sink to wash his hands, despite every bathroom in our house having sinks with access to soap. So even if he goes goes to the bathroom, he will walk out and wash his hands at the kitchen sink.
* (This is the result of a situation I don't know if I need to explain fully for the story, but the necessary context is that our downstairs bathroom and his room are currently under renovation due to water damage late last year). His process of getting into the shower include using the half-bathroom by the kitchen or going to the laundry room just down the hall, getting fully undressed, then hurrying through the house fully naked to reach the master bathroom. I have seen him fully naked many, many more times than I ever cared to, which is obviously fucking 0.
* If he poops, it is an all out crisis to him. He will be in the bathroom for an hour and burn through a ton of wet wipes. He will take a shower and use probably triple the usual amount of soap and shampoo he'd normally use, and take upwards of an hour in the shower.
* If he just goes to the bathroom normally, it justifies a change of shirt to him. He will take off his shirt when he's done and go wash his hands, then go put the shirt into the hamper and wash his hands again before getting a new shirt. All the while being shirtless. Again, embarrassing when I have friends over who don't want to see that.
* He will often pee outside. We have a larger property, so he'll typically go way out to pee. But I have on more than one occasion heard and/or found pee spots just outside our basement door. Two specific instances come to mind. The first is following a large snow storm, I heard very clear peeing sounds outside my window. The second, I saw him standing just outside the downstairs door leading to the patio, and found a massive pee spot right next to the door and almost against the house.

And before anyone labels this as germaphobic behavior, I would have agreed with you for a long time, until my oldest brother (who is in his 30s and moved out) pointed out the fact that he does not obsess over EVERYTHING being clean. He doesn't wipe down places he wants to sit, he's not disinfecting everything, he is actually quite fond of public transportation. He doesn't actually CLEAN anything - his room was incredibly messy and generally in disarray, with thick layers of dust everywhere. His stashes also got incredibly dusty, and when our mother and I eventually took it upon ourselves to start cleaning up his spots, he actually found mouse poop behind a lot of books and items of his on the downstairs table. So while I don't know what else it could be labeled as other than symptoms of OCD, I know it's not a case of germaphobia.

There is probably a lot more I could mention, but I'd rather get into the next part of things - how his health, habits, and attitude has changed, and how this has affected our family.

He stopped doing any kind of sports or community interaction. He became rather obsessed with TikTok and if he's not reading or watching TV or YouTube, he's on TikTok watching Karen skits or family drama skits (this is important later). He started eating A LOT. I'm bad at gauging weight and height by sight alone, but my best guess is that he's about 6'6"", and between 300-350 lbs. He has eaten almost entire pans of brownies I make in a day, he has eaten a full 3lb bag of Sam's Club nuggets in a few days. He stopped maintaining his appearance, and now has a patchy and thin facial hair he will shave every week or two as well as patchy skin and pimples. He has stopped getting his hair cut entirely, even stopped getting it trimmed, with it having grown out down to his neck and to the point that he ties it back often. While he does at least wash it (excessively), he doesn't take care of it in any other way than brushing it sometimes, leading to it looking incredibly frizzy and beginning to thin out and recede. I know this is because of how he takes care of it, because we are not genetically disposed to balding at any age on either side of our family.

He has also gotten incredibly lazy. A lot of the time, he will just be sitting on the couch listening to music, reading a book, watching a movie/show, or watching TikTok. If he's asked to do any kind of household chore, he gets all huffy like a teenager being asked to do a chore. And not to mention, he will either put off the chore for as long as possible or until someone else does it, he will take an ungodly amount of time to actually complete it, or will only do it halfway and get upset when he's asked to finish it.

As I stated, our downstairs bathroom and his room had to be packed up and repaired due to water damage, and we took the chance to rennovate and have been working on it since. The damage happened in October, and he has been sleeping on the couch since. But in about March, it was finally to the point where we could rennovate and begin putting things back in order. But he has put zero effort into his room. As of right now, he could 100% move back into it and sleep on his bed again, but he decides to continue sitting on the couch through most of the day. His room right now has 1 wall painted, with some paint on another wall, with all the paint supplies on the floor and covered in dust, with all of his stuff he had to move out for the repair just stuffed back into his room, also covered in an insane amount of dust. And if you ever bring up how he should finish his room so he can sleep on his own bed and have his own space again, he just gets upset and huffy.

Where this really has affected me and our mother is how he treats us with both his new habits and his obsession with ""cleanliness"". He sees his perspective as the only correct perspective, and it often leads to conflicts between us and him. My mother and I are not unhygienic - we wash our hands after using the bathroom, doing some chores, etc. We clean enough to make things tidy, we do our laundry once a week, we do everything that normal hygienic people do. Sometimes we pick up things from the floor. Sometimes we take dishes out of the sink/dishwasher, give them a rinse, and call them good. We touch door handles. Stuff sometimes touches our clothes and we don't change our clothes.

But what we do not only isn't enough for him, sometimes he just thinks it's wrong. Pick up something from the ground? We should wash our hands. Throw anything in the trash? Wash your hands. Pet the dogs? We shouldn't touch this or that. Clean up a mess from the dogs? We need to spray the spot with a huge amount of disinfectant. We're not allowed to touch his laundry or take it out and put it somewhere so we can do laundry or else he needs to run the ENTIRE load through again. We ask him to take out the trash? Well that's a huge problem and he often will take up to 30 minutes to actually get the trash bag out, take it to the bin, and replace the bag, then he washes his hands for an extra amount of time after (and this is only worse when he's asked to empty the bathroom trash of all the wet wipes he uses). Ask him to pick up something he dropped? He will ignore you.

His behavior, in my opinion, has gone beyond just being anxious - it has become downright controlling, abusive, and incredibly self-centered. He does not care when you bring up something he's done that bothered you or directly affected you in some way. We have tried to talk to him about everything - why he shouldn't wash his hands for so long, why he needs to take shorter and less showers, why he shouldn't wash his clothes as much as he does. Why he shouldn't talk to us the way he does when he disagree with him, how selfish it comes across when he uses an insane amount of soap and leaves us with nothing, or when he takes a shower and uses all the hot water, or when we go to wash our clothes and he's taken the washer AGAIN, not to mention using a ton of the detergent. We have talked to him about this for the last 5 years, and not only has he not cared and not changed in the slightest, a lot of things have just gotten worse.

It's not just a lack of care though. If he gets push back or disagreement, he becomes very hostile. He usually starts with just insisting on his point in a more aggressive way. He has used a ""dad tone"" not only with me, but with our own mother. He often will become very condescending. He will talk down to us and essentially say things like how he has more sense and/or we don't have the common sense to do whatever he's saying we should/shouldn't do. He deflects and will relate what we're trying to discuss with him to some other instance of offense he took (for example, when our mom found out about him peeing on the porch, he tried to deflect and say it wasn't as disgusting as asking someone to wear clothes out of the hamper). With his deflection, he will often try and make rather harsh digs. Saying that we have no common sense, or that we're just being incredibly unsanitary, and saying in various ways that we're basically dumb for how we act because it's not in line with his view.

He and our mom got into a lot of heated arguments over the past five years, and I heard a lot of things he'd say to her. Attacking her for things she did that he views as bad or wrong, deflecting blame to her, talking down to her like a child. And seeing how he treated her was infuriating to me. Not only is she in full-time care of our autistic brothers, and she has to deal with the added stress of all of his extra habits and literally footing the bill for his extra electricity and water usage, but she then had to deal with him yelling at her and scolding her. But the issue is, while my brother does have a job, he does not make enough to afford rent anywhere else, he doesn't have a car, and he doesn't have anyone to go to if he were to leave, and being her son, she doesn't want to leave him homeless and without any support at all.

But it got to the point with her that I pulled him aside one time and told him that if he didn't stop talking to our mom like that, that we were actually going to fight. Granted, he ran and told her that I said that quickly after, but she was so fed up with how he treated her that I saw no repercussions, and he at least sort of toned down how he spoke to her.

There's other examples of him just being nasty and selfish, this one I'd figure I'd mention. We went on a trip to a big city a few months ago for our mom's birthday, where we got a suite with not enough beds for everyone. The plan me, my mom, and my oldest brother thought up was to just rotate someone sleeping on the floor on a nest of blankets and pillows. I would sleep on the floor the first night, my oldest brother would sleep on it the second, then my brother would sleep on it the last night. Come the last night, we tell him that he'll be sleeping on the floor, and he outright just says ""No, I won't be"". Not like he was pushing back, or like he was ready for a fight, just like he was stating a fact. That started a whole argument, and we eventually just had to keep an eye on him around when we were settling in to make sure he didn't steal a bed.

I digress again.

Then there's myself and him. I will admit that I know I was not and can sometimes still not be a nice person when it comes to disagreements. Even before this situation, I was a little brat and I would relish in the chance to ""spew venom"" (as my parents called it and subsequently my brother calls it) any chance I could. I was a dick, and sometimes I can still be a dick. However, following my parents' divorce in 2016, I steadily found myself trying to be more patient in situations, and trying to take care of both the house and my autistic brothers more and more, despite being the youngest. I wanted to help keep things in order, I wanted to keep stability, and most importantly, I wanted to try and lighten the load on my mom. When all this started, I was particularly nasty with my brother early on because I saw the added stress it was putting on her, and often I would become very nasty in my comments towards him.

But following my AITA post on Reddit where they made me accept that these are symptoms of OCD and a talk with my mom, I reeled it in. I bit my tongue on mean comments and tried to present them in a more discussional manner - which didn't matter any way because he still would not listen to me. I tried to be patient, even just avoiding commenting on a lot of things he was doing because I knew it would just cause an argument or he would turn to his deflecting and condescention, and it just wouldn't help. If we did get into an argument, I worked really hard to just contain my anger and respond to exactly what he said to me. I actually went so far as to calculate how much water he was using for every laundry load, every hand wash, and every shower; to find out how long the average soap bottle or bar should last; or even just how long surgeons, who have to be incredibly sterle, wash their hands for.

None of that mattered. None of that actually got him to listen to me about anything, and it certainly did nothing to stop him from being hostile and verbally abusive towards me constantly. He will try and call me careless because I won't wash my hands after doing something, then I turn around and outright refuse to. He will try to take a fatherly tone with me and demand I do something, and will only get more angry when I say no, and to not talk to me like that because he's not my dad.

He will deflect the second we get into an argument which is usually about something he is currently doing and try to bring up various instances of issues he's had with me. For example, I forgot to wash my hands ONE time after going to the bathroom - literally once. I wasn't choosing not to, I wasn't in a rush and decided it would be faster. If I remember right, I was just sucked into doing something and was trying to get back to it. He instantly snapped at me and scolded me, again like he was my dad, demanding I get back in the bathroom and wash my hands. We got into an argument about it, whether he seemed to misunderstand why I was upset - it wasn't because I was asked to wash my hands, it was because of how he demanded I do so and treated me like i decided to just wipe shit on my fingers. Ever since then, in every argument we have, he will try to deflect from whatever point I make to him by saying something along the lines of ""Well, I'm not the one who chooses to not wash their hands after they poop."" Even though I do. And remind him I do everytime.

That's just one example. He has a lot of ""ammunition"" he uses against me to degrade me, make me feel like I'm stupid or lack sense, or downright insult me for. Even though I act just like a normal person would act, it's not ""his"" normal, so when we're in arguments, he turns our normal into something that's dumb.

And god forbid I get upset and get nasty with him back. Because he falls back on how it used to be when I truly was a worse person - He calls me cruel, he says that I'm just mean, that all I do is spew venom and attack him, that I'm way overreacting. He is insanely into Taylor Swift, and every time I get particularly upset, he just says ""you need to calm down"" in a sing-song voice, like from the Taylor Swift song. Basically, yes, I do get upset sometimes and push my point by getting mean - but he invalidates whatever I'm trying to say by just slapping the label of venomous and cruel on me again.

And if I say anything that particularly upsets him or actually curse at him, he will run to our mom and tell her what I said. Again, because I used to be a dickhead, so when I would do something like that before, he'd go to them and they'd punish me. But now, if I say something he doesn't like or curse at him, he will run to our mom and repeat what I said, but nothing comes of it. Because at this point, our mom understands what I'm saying and why I get as upset as I get. That's usually when our arguments get really, really heated and I raise my voice and say nastier things about how he's acting foolish or that no one else does what he does, or how he is just being an asshole about everything.

But please note. I do my best to not yell or scream. I try not to get petty after arguments by doing stuff to outright bother him. Despite how much I do not like what he does, I don't go out of my way to terrorize him. Not out of a lack of ideas, but because I know it would only cause fights and make things worse between us.

I never LIKED fighting with him on this stuff. I never WANTED to blow up at him. At first, I wanted him to get better and for our relationship to go back to normal. And over the course of the last five years and his constant conflict, I'm just at the point that I want it to stop. I've stopped trying to actively improve things because he refuses to give up any ground, but I've also refused to make it any worse between us. But unfortunately, my apathy just led to things getting worse and worse.

For months now, I've vented to family and friends about how much what he does bothers me and how I'm just gonna stop doing things like driving him to work or the theater, or listening to him chatter on about movies and shows, but I never actually stopped. And even last year, I was hit with a realization of just how much I did care for him, following an incident where he was hit by a car. It was probably the most worried I had ever been in my life, and I made it a point to take care of things as much as I could for him. But following the accident and his recovery, he went right back to how he treated us and how he spoke to us during disagreements.

Last night was my breaking point. I was making brownies while watching a movie with our mom, and I had put a measuring cup into the sink. He walked in and started his usual long handwash, and just offhandedly said, ""Just make sure you wash the measuring cup, I washed my hands on it."" Again, when he does this kind of stuff, I really get upset internally, I want to just snap at him and tell him to not tell me to do things that don't make sense. But I didn't want to fight last night. So I just told him, ""I'll just give it a rinse and dry it off, it'll be fine.""

That didn't stand with him. He immediately put up his dad-tone and with that sort of teeth-clenched voice demanded that I wash the measuring cup. I've made it a point to not bend when he demands things as to not reinforce it (though it clearly is already reinforced in his mind), but to not blow up when he demands things because I know he'll very quickly fall back on me overreacting and being cruel. So, I matched his energy as I tend to do, and just said ""Make me.""

Oh, he took some particular offense to that last night. He scolded me again and demanded I wash it, because he washed his hands over it so it needs it. I told him, ""It will be fine if I just rinse it, and you are not my dad.""

Of course he launched into his usual tirade with being condesending and degrading me. It was just such a blur, but I remember a few remarks, in no particular order. That it's common sense to fully wash something that people wash their hands over. That he's not the one who doesn't wash his hands after he poops. That I just act like germs don't exist. That I'm just careless. That I lack common sense.

I responded to everything he said by just pointing out what he was doing or that he was just wrong. No, it is fine to just rinse off a dish. That he was deflecting from the fact he was trying to demand things of me that made no sense by trying to make me seem gross. That I know germs exist but I take the normal precautions. That what he's suggesting isn't common sense, it only makes sense to him and no one else. I eventually said that he's being careless by just not caring about other people and forcing everything to be sterile, which yeah, was an overstatment. He pointed it out and said that he absolutely does not make everything sterile, and I just said ""yeah, and that's why you pee on the porch."" Which I know was just coming after him directly, but this was at the climax of the argument and I was frustrated.

He was quiet for a minute, to which I just said ""what, you don't have some hateful quip to say before you run off?"" He just got huffy and said ""You have NO common sense"" and tried to hurry off, followed by another ""NO SENSE!"" from another room. This is how he tries to ""win"" arguments - get the last word in by saying some ""smart"" remark and running off, sometimes followed up by another quip from the other room. Why? Becauset that's how arguments are won in movies and shows, or in skits on TikTok where the cool good guy says an insult to a ""Karen"" and leaves. But obviously it doesn't win arguments because this is real life, it just means he ends the argument on the last word so he feels like he won.

Keep in mind that I never raised my voice during this. I said what I needed to in order to match his energy, but I never went above a speaking tone. The thought crossed my mind - I had shown just how much I truly do care about him when he was in an accident, despite our disagreements, and that even with what was going on, I was trying to look out for him. And his response is to continue degrading me and talking down to me for doing normal things.

I have been talked down to like this for 5 years. I have had to put up with his actions and listen to him throw fits about stuff that we do not see as an issue. I have had him berate me and my mom for years now. And yet, I keep doing things for him because I don't want to be THAT person who just refuses to have anything to do with a family member, and because at the very least, I had some sort of care towards him. But that disagreement, which wasn't even the worst of what we've had, just convinced me that I was done doing anything for him. It felt different than just thinking about not it, it felt like the committment just...happened, and that it was already starting. I wouldn't be taking him to work. I wouldn't listen to him anymore. I wouldn't try and tiptoe around his rules. I wouldn't do anything for him. I even started it off by finishing up those brownies, and specifically writing a note that said they weren't for him.

I sat down to watch the rest of the movie with my mom. I put my feet up to relax on the couch, which happens to be the one he sleeps on. It was partially out of pettiness, but I also just did not care. He comes storming out after a long shower and snaps at me to move my feet because they were touching his laundry on the other end of the couch. They weren't, but I just shifted my feet a little bit. He scoffed and walked off, grumbling about how I was petty. Again, I didn't raise my voice, but I wanted him to know where he stood with me. I told him that how I acted was the natural consequences of ruining a relationship. He got offended and demanded I repeat myself, so I did. He tried to coax me into another argument, finishing off with ""Pff, just two minutes to wash could have avoided all this."" I didn't engage, I just stayed quiet and watched the movie.

My intent was to just stay quiet and basically give him the cold shoulder, and just say no to any requests he had. I wasn't going to be outright petty, I wasn't going to pick fights, I was just going to remove myself as a resource for him entirely. (Which, by the way, a lot of my attempts to just ignore him as he talks to me results in ""Oh wow, the cold shoulder, reaaal mature"". So I'm nasty if I engage with him, but I'm immature if I don't talk to him). I wasn't going to say what I wanted to say, but I wasn't going to continue pretending like it didn't affect our relationship.

But after the movie finished, he tried to storm up to me and say ""Alright, you and I need to talk before either of us go to bed."" I know what that means for him. His version of ""talk"" after an argument is just calling me mean, petty, that I overreact, and basically continuing to refuse to give up any ground and expecting me to just concede.

I knew what was going to happen if we talked. I knew I was going to get angry. I knew I was going to blow up at him. I did not want to. So I simply said ""No."" and walked away.

He instantly got angry and shouted ""No!"". He rushed in front of me to try and block me from going downstairs - a tactic he does a lot when words don't work, he will physically try to prevent things. I shoved past him and went downstairs. He demanded I get back upstairs and talk, and I just said, ""No."" again and went to my room.

Then he followed me. I closed my door and locked it. He tried to open my door, then when he couldn't simply figured he had cornered me enough and started into his speech about him mean and petty.

I try so hard to be patient. I have had coworkers I have wanted to scream at for actually doing nothing. I have had a boss that tried to screw me out of money in a contract. I have dealt with my brother for years treating me like this. And I have tried to just keep the peace, not scold, not yell, just be patient and let things go, no matter how much they stress me. But him trying to corner me in my room and shout at me through my door about how I'm a bad person just brought out everything.

I screamed at the top of my lungs at him. I screamed at him about how I've had to deal with his shit for 5 years. I screamed that I've had enough of him treating me like this. I screamed that I was never going to do anything for him ever again. I just screamed as loud as I could force myself to. Some part of me was even susprised at how loud I could get.

I tried to interject. He tried to say that nothing he does justifies me just being cruel. I screamed back that he was the cruel one, he treated me so badly and I was done with it. He tried to pull a sympathy card, whining that he ""didn't ask to have anxiety, but-"" and I didn't even let him finish. I screamed that he doesn't get to push it on us. He has refused therapy and counseling for years (and continues to do so, despite our mom providing several resources for him - he won't look online, he won't make any committments, he just refuses to go). He refused to go see anyone about it and we had to effectively force him onto medicine that he doesn't take consistently enough to work. I screamed that he was treating us so poorly and I am just done with it at this point, I'm not doing anything for him anymore.

And to my surprise, he just walked away from my door, without trying to get a last word in.

I have never screamed at someone like that in my life. Not to my coworkers, not to anyone thats made me angry before, not to my boss, no one. Not even during any stupid angsty arguments as a teenager. I was just so incredibly angry and I felt like it was the only way I could get him to just leave me alone and stop talking to me like I was the villain of some family drama story that could be fixed just by telling them all the bad things they were.

He left for work before I got up this morning, so I haven't talked to him. But I'm just finished, I don't care to talk to him, I don't care to reconcile this. He's tried to just walk up after arguments and apologize for how he acted, but at this point, it's not going to fix it because he does not change. Him apologizing for everything won't fix it. And at this point, unless he does a total 180 and changes for the better, nothing he does is going to fix it.

I know he has autism and OCD, and I know that those two together create problems. I understand he needs support. I understand that his social circle is limited because of his autism and that the more people he can have around him the better. I also understand that he does not always act hostile, and does try to be friendly. And I understand that as his family member, I should be pressing him even harder to do better.

But I have spent 5 years being called some form of disgusting, bad, venomous, careless, or stupid on almost a weekly basis. I have spent years telling him, with our mom, that he needs therapy and continuing to tell him, only to get him being more upset at us for saying that he does. He acknowledges he has a problem, but when we say he needs to get help or offer anything to start the process, he shuts it down. But he also won't look for any way to help himself. Our mom has told him that what he's doing is going to tear apart his relationships, and you know what, I'm done keeping our relationship together for the simple fact of proving her wrong and not upsetting her. If I don't agree with him, then I have no common sense. If I argue with him on something, I'm venomous and overreacting. If I try to remove myself from the situation or not talk to him, I'm immature.

At this point, I don't care if I'm the asshole for pulling away entirely. I have tried. I have been patient. I have discussed calmly, I have argued, I have presented facts, I have asked other people about it, I have encouraged getting help, and none of it works. Let me be the asshole then, because if being the asshole means I can be treated like shit at least a little less because I avoid him, then fine, I'd take that deal. I try so hard to be a kind person and not let my anger get the best of me, but if he wants to insist that I am only the angry person that I used to be and invalidate everything I try to say or do, then what is the point of trying to continue to be kind to him?

I won't go out of my way to hurt him or terrorize him. But I am not doing anything for him. I'm not talking to him anymore, I'm not driving him anywhere anymore, I won't even let him eat any treats I make if I can get away with it.

I'm done. I do not care. I suppose this is a cry for help, just some kind of outside perspective, but at the same time, I don't know if I care enough anymore.

{Note on a few things:  
\- He has a job, part time. He has to either take public transport to get there or get a ride from our mom or myself. She and I have our own cars, he does not.

\- Yes, we all live in the same home. Yes, both I and him do pay rent. No, as much as I'd like to move out, I can't. For one, the housing and rent market where I am is ungodly expensive, and I got laid off from my job in March and have been job hunting ever since.

\- My mom is not just letting him do all this and is very much on my side, but her perspective is different because she has to take care of him. She has gotten into the same arguments that I have with him, and he does the exact same thing, and continues to just not listen. She has tried many things, but he either works around them or just totally ignores her. It's not so much that he's getting away with it, it's more that we just don't know what we could possibly do to punish him for not listening or caring. He's 26, not a teenager, despite how he acts. We can't just kick him out, because she doesn't want him to be homeless and even with how I am now, I don't want that. We can't up his rent because he hardly pays it because he throws his money away on books and stuff, so upping it would just mean he'd contribute even less money to the house.

\- Yes, we have offered him routes of thereapy, counseling, and psychology. He usually just refuses them all. Sometimes he'll say he's looking into things, but nothing comes of it. And again, he's 26, we can't drag him to the doctor's office.}",4,1748112107.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.84,False
1kuio5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1kuio5h/my_journey_with_adhd_from_childhood_compliance_to/,My Journey with ADHD: From Childhood Compliance to Adult Healing,"# My Journey with ADHD: From Childhood Compliance to Adult Healing

When I was younger, I was treated for ADHD with Dexedrine. I didn't really understand why people told me I had a problem and needed to take this medication. I went along with it because I wanted my mom to look at me a certain way. I wanted her approval‚Äîsomething I not only chased with her, but with most people in my life. Of course, I didn't realize I was doing that back then. There was no awareness within me of the purpose of the medication, no understanding of what it was meant to address. I was simply a child being told I needed to be fixed, without any real connection to why.

At some point in my late teens, I chose to stop taking prescription medication and began to self-medicate with cannabis. This wasn't just a rejection of medication‚Äîit was an active opposition to the entire pharmaceutical approach. Life seemed to be great for a few years, but eventually big life changes created stress and I didn't know how to deal with the way I was feeling. I didn't really know myself fully... but who does at 21 years old?

After 18 years of raw dogging life, I read a book by Gabor Mat√© called *Scattered Minds*. It's a book about ADHD that approaches it not as a genetic disorder but through the lens of trauma and development. I was already into Mat√© because of his work with compassionate inquiry, a self-inquiry practice that had proven useful for me in debugging difficulties in my life.

The book was eye-opening to say the least. I could clearly see myself in the way Mat√© was articulating people who struggle with the symptoms of ADHD. One example stood out to me in particular‚ÄîI'll paraphrase: Imagine an intersection with a police officer coordinating all the traffic, clearly seeing everything as it approaches and directing it accordingly. For a person with ADHD, it's like that policeman fell asleep. When I heard this example it was a big WHOA moment for me. Up to that point I had been struggling with starting and completing things I felt I wanted to do. I didn't have issues with work, paying bills, or losing things, like others reportedly do, but just with the things I wanted to bring forth from within myself. I would begin a task, and eventually so many thoughts pour into my mind I could not stay focused, I feel overwhelmed by the noise, and I stop what I am working on, and get carried away with whatever other thoughts entered my mind.

What Gabor outlines in *Scattered Minds* about trauma has laid out groundbreaking work in approaching these types of disorders in a way that can lead to real healing. This stands in stark contrast to mainstream science that insists ADHD is genetic and incurable. I beg to differ, and my experience proves it.

After I completed his book, for the first time in so many years, I felt like maybe it would be worth it to give taking some form of medication a try‚Äîbut this time with full awareness and intention. At that point I was still scared to commit to getting a psychiatrist and going the formal route, but I was becoming more open to the idea. I did find a nootropic called phenylpiracetam in a product called ""Absolute Focus"" by Bright Brain. There were some other nootropics in it which all contributed to helping maintain focus.

I gave Absolute Focus a try. The first time I took it, it was before dinner. After dinner my partner and I watched a movie, and I found myself able to work on my computer and watch the movie without trailing off in either direction. I was also exploring a coding framework I had never explored before, and was able to retain what I learned as I moved through the demo. This was something I was not used to. The next morning, I took it before I left and went off on my usual morning routine. When I got to the coffee shop I like to hang out at, and sat down, I realized my head was silent. It felt so clear. This was very strange and I remember thinking to myself, is this how it is for a person that doesn't struggle with these symptoms of ADHD?

One amazing benefit of this quieting of mind was that I become 100% more emotionally present. I could feel my environment much more than usual because I wasn't hearing 100 different streams of thoughts bombard my head.

After 3 or 4 days, I took a day off, amazed at how I had felt I didn't go backwards in terms of my emotional presence or clear headed thinking.

This stuff worked! Well, it worked for SOME symptoms... but not all of them.

Eventually, after some months with this product, I found myself still failing at being able to bring about the things I felt I wanted to. I worked up the verve to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. The crucial difference this time was that I approached medication not as something I was told I needed, but as a conscious choice‚Äîa potential therapeutic tool that I could use alongside my years of self-inquiry practice and NLP training.

She was lovely, and a great listener. She agreed that I do struggle with ADHD symptoms and prescribed me Vyvanse.

The first day taking Vyvanse was something quite remarkable. It was as if the noise and dark cloud that I had not really noticed was hanging over my inner atmosphere was washed away. Before I left the house that morning, I gave my partner a hug, and noticed that I actually felt her put her arms around me, and then realized I do not remember when the last time a hug felt that way. I was totally present. I felt a sense of joy in myself that I seemed to have lost touch with.

Some hours later it seems that the clouds started to return... and I wasn't feeling as great as initially.

But here's where my years of self-work became crucial. After spending a week working with Vyvanse, I began to notice that after the initial 2 hours had passed where it felt like nothing short of a miracle, I would end up engaging in thoughts that were akin to the dark cloud returning. I started to pay more attention. I started to see when a cloud was rolling in, and rather than engage with it, I found myself creating a different picture. The things I would identify with that created me to feel cloudy, I could see they were not true and let them float past.

This process actually allowed me to not feel the medication had stopped working, but rather it turned into a day of flow where I was able to stay with myself, without all the clouds. The medication gave me the space to stop reacting emotionally, which allowed me to detect the underlying triggers for why I had been reacting that way all along.

# The Therapeutic Breakthrough

Over the past five weeks, this process has only deepened. What I've experienced has been nothing short of a miraculous therapeutic benefit. I have healed patterns that have been present in myself for years, peeling back layers of what actually drives me to react the way I do‚Äîand the layers just keep peeling back.

I've been able to catch myself before I react to patterns that contributed to years of stress. I'm able to see clearly WHY I was reacting that way, and by looking and inquiring into what's coming up, I have rewired myself where I do not engage in these behaviors that were causing me stress. I have observed concrete changes to things that once triggered me into reacting a certain way. I've worked through the intense sensations that would come up which I normally would react to because I felt it was going to ultimately affect my safety. When the things that would activate the triggers in myself occur now, it doesn't even phase me.

The coolest part for me isn't just that I have healed these patterns, it's the clarity in seeing the roots of them. This is proof that trauma can be healed and healing it absolutely influences behavioral health. It points directly to where these behavioral problems originate, and rather than having someone believe they have an incurable disorder, we can actually teach people how to address and resolve these issues.

# The Critical Caveat

I never thought I would advocate for medication, but here we are. It might not be for everyone, but it certainly helped me. Though one caveat to this I want to firmly put across is that **I didn't just take the medication‚ÄîI took it and worked on myself**.

I do not at all believe it was solely the medication that created these therapeutic benefits. It was the medication coupled with the training and experience in the application of self-inquiry and NLP that I have under my belt that really has led to the quality of the therapeutic benefits. When things came up, I found myself having a therapy session with myself. The medication doesn't fix you, but it can be a powerful method of therapy when we set our intention that way.

In the years prior to taking the medication, I had learned a lot about myself and about the roots and nature of triggers. I felt equipped to deal with things when they came up. Perhaps the ideal situation for people who choose medication would be to have this awareness. Either working with yourself if you feel equipped, or working with a counselor, coach or therapist, or even both‚Äîthis is how you can get the most out of medication as a form of therapy. A road to true healing, rather than lifelong use of medication.

# A New Paradigm

My journey represents a fundamental shift: from being a child who was medicated without understanding or agency, to an adult who actively opposed pharmaceutical intervention, to finally someone who could approach medication with full awareness, intention, and a toolkit for healing. This isn't about medication compliance‚Äîit's about using every available tool, including medication, as part of a conscious healing journey.

What I want to advocate for is this approach: recognizing that what we call ADHD may have roots in trauma and development, that it can be healed, and that medication‚Äîwhen combined with deep self-work‚Äîcan be a powerful catalyst for that healing rather than a lifelong crutch. We need to teach people how to address and resolve these issues at their root, not just manage symptoms indefinitely.

The difference between taking medication as a child because you're told you're broken and taking it as an adult as part of an intentional healing journey is profound. One reinforces helplessness; the other empowers transformation.",1,1748112059.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

A little more about us: 
One male and one female and both are in early 30‚Äôs. We are transplants from the Midwest and east coast and have lived at the house since it was built in 2020! We all have our own lives but once in a blue moon we will do something together i.e. grab a bite to eat, concerts, pickleball, movies, holiday celebrations, etc. One works from home (finance) and likes cooking, yoga, meditation, researching restaurants, and playing guitar. The other is hybrid (supply chain at a gaming company) and likes motorcycling, going to the gym, pickleball, and comedy shows. Shared interests include anime, gaming, coffee, and rock music! Occasionally someone might vape. In terms of alcohol, we rarely drink by ourselves but in social situations we may partake. One of the housemates burns incense in their room twice a day and opens all the windows (other housemates have said they can hardly smell it).

A little more about what we are looking for:
Ideally we‚Äôd like someone that is low maintenance, positive vibes, steady job, clean, tidy, respectful, responsible, and no drama! Since we are in our 30‚Äôs now we will have people over but we‚Äôre not looking to party all the time üëµüèΩüòÇ As for pets, we are leaning towards no pets, but for someone that‚Äôs cool we can open the conversation for ONE CAT üêà provided that person can give the attention and care the cat requires. The house is month-to-month but ideally we‚Äôd want our new housemate to stay for at least two years so we don‚Äôt have to keep going through this process all the time üòé

Rent is $1369 per month (month-to-month) + utilities. Security deposit is $1319.

For the person that ends up moving in, they will apply through the real estate agency, name will go on the lease, work out the security deposit with the housemate that moved out, then they‚Äôll be good to move in!

If interested or any questions message me. Thanks for reading üôè

A healthy baby boy by all accounts. Grew up the first year of my life, baptized Catholic, normal baby boy, family moves to Kentucky from Jersey to be near my pop pop. Age two problems start, I have speech regression, my milestones fall apart, paddy training etc. Mom takes me to the University of Kentucky doctor. Doctor says (at the time) I have aspergers. Said I'll never walk, talk, ride a bike or have a normal life. My mom puts me in intensive early intervention training. Realize from a young age I am fucked up. No one wanted to be my friend, inclusion classes the like. Had gender dysphoria from a very young age. Desperately wanted to be a girl. Begged my parents to let me be a girl. Got all the help in the workd for my autism, none for my gender identity. Lived a very isolated childhood, video games raised me. Interests moved away from girl ones because ""those make mom and dad's scream"". Years pass, shit happens, my teen years occur. Again, confront mom and dad. Deeply unhappy and in pain with my changing body. I have puppy dog eyes at the pediatrician while I BEG for life saving gender affirming care. Mom puts her foot down, ""parental rights"" as I stare the doctor in the eyes, teaes in my eyes begging for treatment. High school comes, high school goes, reach the age of 18. 

I should have started HRT, I should have got a job and moved out. Extremely emotionally undeveloped and stunted. Spend almost the next 10 years in and out of community college, a year unemployed where my already chunky body ballooned to 306 lbs at 5'11. Hair severely thinned. At 26 mom finally relents and I self advocate, seek out HRT while I returned to college to finish, have a two year associates while most people by then have graduated. I know what you are thinking and will say to my post. ""Comparison is the thief of joy! Everyone is unique! Everyone goes at their own pace!"" then why is my life so shit? How can I make myself feel better and fix my life when there is no frame of reference for comparison?

If I didn't have autism I would have  been homeless. Ended up in a shelter, then a respite stay, then shared living, now have an independent autism waiver with ""in home and community"" staff so far up my ass I cant breathe. They have reduced hours but I still have four hours a week of someone I DONT WANT IN MY HOME, in my home to maintain the rent assistance that comes with my autism services.

Primary Medicare wouldnt cover it, NOW with Republicans about to pass their ""big beautiful bill"" I'll have to pay out of pocket for hormones while ALREADY on the poverty line, having to work less because earn to much"". I had my balls sliced off in December before Trump became president. I'm almost three years on HRT and I look like shit. Hair came in decently but still has a ""M"" shape. Facial hair still grows, cant consistently voice train because I cant bring myself to do ANYTHING with my goals. I'm not in an environment to voice train, I'm in unbearable amounts of pain. I cry myself to sleep.every night, I passively tell my one trans girl friend who is the ONE that sticks with me because I've become a pariah in local trans circles because of my politics, desire to be cis fem and neurotypical, I told her I want to die, that this will eventually kill me. I hate my body, I see a blonde gorilla looking me in the eyes. Everyone hugboxes and say I pass so well. Then why is ot, when I put a tshirt and jeans on all of a SUDDEN I'm sir? 

Why do cis works get to dress down and be girls? I also feel my brain is at war with me because of my masculine interests. Don't tell me they aren't gendered, because when these interests are the MAJORITY of my hesdspave, when I TRY to do feminine things and recoil in pain and fear because of ot being ""cringe"" and me being an ""invader"" and the only other thing I can think about every day outside the PAIN of my gender, with my obsession with history, is seeing us in the nightmare timeline, the Trump won again timeline, the 4th Reich tineline, the alternative being leftism/anarchism/communism or any OTHER type of ideology I just see Hitler and Stalin looking out from their Graves trying to come back. I feel so much PAIN that literally nothing in my life went right. My gender wasn't right, my mind wasn't right, the family I wanted to be born i to wasn't right, the timeline wasn't right, loterally everything in my life is so.e sort of extension and pain from the central core

I was not born a girl, and telling me I already was one, when the ability to make me one does not exist, has created a life of insufferable agony for me.

Weakened from childbirth, I had no strength to fend off Gregory's attack, only the will to listen to his bitter accusations:

""If you hadn't insisted on going to the hospital, Jovie wouldn't have been in that accident today.""

""And don't talk to me about the child. I won't visit him!""

Jovie emerged from her hospital room with just a tiny scar by her eye, yet Gregory was ready to do anything for her.

She collapsed into Gregory's arms, her eyes red with tears.

Seeing her pitiful state, Gregory held her tighter.

""Don't blame Hana. Even though she used surgery to look like me, didn't she take good care of you all these years?""

""I suppose she never realized I‚Äôm a cosmetic surgeon. I can spot surgical marks at once.""

""Although we missed each other, I'm just happy to be with you now.""

Gregory wiped my blood off his hand with disdain, gently caressing the emerald pendant around Jovie‚Äôs neck.

""Thank goodness for this pendant, or I might have mistaken someone else as my savior.""

I struggled to stand, filled with resentment.

It was I who had saved him back then.

Five years ago, Gregory was kidnapped, and I was stabbed three times, fighting with all I had to get him to the hospital.

But a year later, my family‚Äôs company went bankrupt, and my parents both passed away.

When I was at my lowest, Gregory found me, promising to be devoted to me.

He adored me completely, and our wedding was the talk of the town.

Just when I thought we‚Äôd share a blissful life together, Jovie appeared before him, claiming she was the one who had saved him.

She looked strikingly similar to me and held the emerald pendant I had lost.

Jovie gifted the pendant to Gregory, claiming it would keep him safe for life.

Using her profession as a cosmetic surgeon, she claimed I had modeled my appearance after hers, stealing her identity as his savior.

In the four years we were together, I had never seen Gregory so furious.

He destroyed all the furniture in our home and forced me to sign the divorce papers.

Then, a record showing I was three months pregnant slipped from my pocket.

A flicker of joy appeared on Gregory‚Äôs face, and he released my hand from signing.

""For the child‚Äôs sake, I won‚Äôt divorce you for now. But don‚Äôt think you can interfere just because you're legally my wife.""

The signed divorce papers fluttered to the ground, and I picked them up, tears streaming down my face.

From that moment on, he spent every day with Jovie, leaving me to attend prenatal check-ups alone.

Even Helena, Gregory‚Äôs mother, was cold toward me, weaving insults about my being a fake into every conversation.

Painfully, I made my way to the emergency room. The on-duty doctor gasped at the sight of my face.

The physical pain was sharp, but it paled compared to the anguish in my heart.

After finally stopping the bleeding from my wounds, Jovie‚Äôs voice echoed from the room next door.",1,1748111873.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1kuilm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kuilm1/voice_optimization_secrets_for_faceless_creators/,Voice Optimization Secrets for Faceless Creators That Boost Retention Rates,"**Voice Optimization Secrets for Faceless Creators That Boost Retention Rates**

Hey, AiContentAutomators community! üé§‚ú®

So, picture this: you‚Äôre scrolling through your favorite platform, you stumble upon a faceless video or audio‚Äîall without a single face in sight. But then, BAM! The voice hits you. It's captivating, engaging, and just draws you in, right? **That‚Äôs the magic of voice optimization**, and it‚Äôs a game changer for anyone looking to elevate their content, especially if you're doing the faceless creator thing.

Let‚Äôs dive into some *voice optimization secrets* that can help boost those retention rates like crazy:

1. **Tone Matters**: Ever notice how some voices just *grab you*? üéôÔ∏è Whether it‚Äôs enthusiastic, soothing, or conversational, your tone can set the whole vibe. If you want to keep your audience glued to the screen, play around with your voice‚Äôs tone. Be relatable! Think of it like chatting with your best buddy over coffee.

2. **Pacing is Key**: Nobody wants to strangle their headphones with too fast or too slow pacing. üé∂ Mix it up! Use varied pacing to emphasize crucial points. Ever heard someone speed up when they‚Äôre excited? Yeah, that. Keep listeners on their toes (but don't make them dizzy).

3. **Breath Control**: If you‚Äôre gasping for air every few seconds, it‚Äôs time to hit the practice vocal drills! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Breathe from your diaphragm, not your throat. This will help you sound more confident and polished. You‚Äôll flow like a river instead of sounding like a winded runner!

4. **Add Some Filler (But Not Too Much!)**: Humor me for a second‚Äîsometimes a well-placed ‚Äúum‚Äù or ‚Äúyou know‚Äù adds a human touch, right? üòÇ But remember, too much can be distracting. Modulate sparingly to keep it fresh!

5. **Engage Through Questions**: Throw in rhetorical questions to keep them thinking. For instance, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you like to keep your audience coming back for more?‚Äù ü§î This makes them mentally nod along rather than just passively watching.

Before I forget, if you want to really nail this voice thing and upscale your skills, I found this *super helpful guide* that dives deeper into AI and voice optimization techniques. Totally worth checking out! (You can find it [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) if you're curious!)

The beauty of being a faceless creator lies in crafting an unforgettable audio experience that resonates. It‚Äôs not just about what you say, but *how* you say it. After all, who doesn‚Äôt love a good story, even if it‚Äôs just a voice behind a screen?

What are your favorite voice tricks? Any stories where optimizing your voice paid off? Let‚Äôs share the gold here!",1,1748111868.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1kuil7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kuil7b/messaging_how_often_what_about/,"Messaging - how often, what about?","Hey, so I'l matched with a woman on Bumble during the week. We've been messaging consistently until today, all small talk, nothing deep, but she mentioned going for coffee in passing and I took that as an opening to actually ask her on a date. We figured out our schedules, and planned a casual date for next Saturday. Yay!

Now I'm feeling really stuck! We haven't messaged since last night, and she's always messaged first so I know it's on me to take some initiative, which I'm happy to do! But she told me that she's away this weekend for a convention. So I'm wondering, should I message her this evening when I know she'll be free, or should I wait until the weekend is over? Like how do I show her I'm keen while still respecting her time, and not coming across as too much? 

Since we have a date set (no time or place yet, just Saturday morning, I'm going to plan and confirm with her during next week), do we need to text every day? 

Also, any good conversation starters that go a bit deeper than ""how was your day""? I know personally I'll get bored with that every day when we have another week before we meet. But I obviously don't want to get too deep before we meet!

I had been eating pretty clean and balanced, and I felt like I had control.

Since starting Ozempic, that control feels like it‚Äôs gone. The binging has come back hard. Last night I ate a huge bag of Skittles in about 10 minutes.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you‚Äôve watched recently?

I‚Äôm a relatively newbie to the pourover and the Third Wave world and for the last year have been treating myself and my wife (and adult older daughter, when she stays with us) with vibrant coffees from the likes of Perc, Dak, Methodical, Tim Wendelboe, Passenger etc. Some wonderful Ethiopians and co-ferments, some good funk, some acidity‚Ä¶ They¬†¬†accept it with good humor but quite obviously prefer more ‚Äútraditional roasts.‚Äù

After a recent trip to Japan (I loved Glitch, I don't care if it's overhyped), we brought home what they consider an absolute winner from a roastery called Chami out of Nara (outside Kyoto). Definitely in the milk-chocolatey realm with a silken body and notes of almond. Gorgeous in its way‚Äîand though it's a light roast, it comes through vividly even in lattes. I was going to order a big batch from Japan but it‚Äôs out of stock. I intend to write to them about availability but my experience with Japanese roasters is that their English is a bit‚Ä¶ tentative.

Needless to say, I want to be a hero to the women of my family so am hoping someone can suggest coffees in the same arena. It is called Brazil Rainha and is a Yellow Bourbon, natural process, from Recreio Farm in Sao Paulo. An admittedly not-exhaustive web search turns up nothing on the plantation. Despite my only semi-educated palate, I think it‚Äôs a coffee many of you would enjoy when in the mood for something complex but, well, amiable.

I‚Äôm also kind of a sucker for charmingly inexact language like this from the Chami site: ‚ÄúLife is a journey with many paths waiting to be discovered. In varying degrees, the little moments we experience along our journey, helps enrich our days. It was one such journey that led to the founding of CHAMI in Japan‚Ä¶ We want to provide a comfortable degree¬†¬∞¬†in all aspects of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. We face the material with an empty heart and concentrate on making the most of its beauty. We believe it‚Äôs all about it. This is what we call ‚ÄúCHAMI Coffee Degree¬†‚ÑÉ‚Äù.¬†FOUNDER:¬†Sayaka who would love to send good and beautiful Japanese things through coffee from CHAMI to the world. Nothing more, nothing less.""

Thanks for any suggestions--nothing more, nothing less!

1kui6mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1kui6mw/am_i_wrong/,Am I wrong?,"I recently moved to a new neighborhood in Seattle, away from my regular and favorite coffee shop (they use chocolate chips instead of sauce, which I loved). I found one nearby that has a similar flavor and have been going there a few times now.

A little backstory: I used to work in coffee several years ago, before latte art was really a thing. I‚Äôm honestly jealous because it looks so fun and people get really creative with it. I had to take a couple different trainings with the companies I worked for. They were very particular about pulling shots. I think the rule was that a shot couldn‚Äôt sit for more than 7 to 10 seconds, though I might be remembering wrong. We also had to recalibrate the machine every few hours, and if a shot didn‚Äôt pour at the right time, we had to reset it.

Which brings me to today. There‚Äôs usually a girl working at this shop who lets the shots sit for a minute plus, but I figured maybe that‚Äôs just how things are done now. Today, someone else was working. I‚Äôve had her before with no issue. But I watched her pour my shot, and the cup wasn‚Äôt under the spout all the way. A good amount of the shot was hitting the rim and spilling down the side. If it had just been a little, I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything, but it was enough that I felt I had to ask. I politely asked if she could please repour it and explained that part of it had spilled. She didn‚Äôt argue, just dumped it and moved on to help another customer. I apologized again for the inconvenience and she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

She then pulled a second shot, but let it sit for at least two minutes while she finished helping another customer, went to the back, and did something at the register. Before she poured the drink, I asked again if I could please have a fresh shot. At that point, she was clearly irritated, which made me feel really uncomfortable. I still thanked her and said I appreciated it. When she called my name, I got flustered, stumbled a little while grabbing the drink, and spilled some on the counter. She said, ‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù and the tone made it feel like she just wanted me gone. I apologized and kind of rushed out.

I‚Äôve been dealing with some heightened anxiety lately, so now I‚Äôm second-guessing whether I was being too picky or if my request was reasonable. Coffee is expensive these days, and I was trying to be respectful, I even tipped a dollar on a 16oz mocha, which felt fair to me.  I hindsight I wish I would have just not said anything at all.

Was I out of line for asking for a fresh shot, especially twice?
Is that considered a difficult or unreasonable request now?
Should I have just let it go?
And how long can a shot really sit before it affects the quality?

I will give you an example of what she does and because I say nothing, I feel like she OWNS me, and she believes that I‚Äôm afraid of her. (She‚Äôs 21 and I‚Äôm 24).

I eat in the kitchen, she enters to make a coffee, she will slam things super loudly, throw ice cubes SUPER loudly, she will sighs heavily, multiple times, anyways, she will be violent in her every move, almost like what she was doing the the stuff, she wanted to do to me (like people who punch the wall because they want to punch you).

And I just do nothing, I don‚Äôt react, and I never reacted. But honestly, I‚Äôm human, my patience isn‚Äôt infinite, and it‚Äôs driving me crazy, the anger is building up, I know she‚Äôs doing this because deep down, she wants a reaction from me. But also, she‚Äôs got so comfortable disrespecting me, and that‚Äôs the part I hate, I feel like I allow her to walk over me, and she loves it.

She then will laugh with my mom 2 minutes after just like she did nothing to me before. I think it‚Äôs her way to tell me ‚ÄúI treat you like shit and I go about my life while you‚Äôre miserable‚Äù.

Like this switch within her mood is scary, I swear to god, the minute before she‚Äôs angry and slam things, and the next minute, she‚Äôs laughing with my mom?????

And hearing her laugh while I sit there, it makes me even more mad, like I‚Äôm left with anger than she gave me, and she‚Äôs all happy like ‚Äúlook at me, I‚Äôm the one in control, I make you mad, and then I go enjoy my life‚Äù.

Idk if I was clear, but those who deal with these things know.

My question is, what are some subtle (or not subtle) ways to give her a taste of her own medicine? Because again, she feels like she owns me and I hate that, I wanna show her that I have my limits and she cannot get away treating me like a piece of shit",1,1748110752.0,raisedbynarcissists,5,1.0,False
1kui5if,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kui5if/how_to_make_this_work_or_should_i_even_continue/,How to make this work or should I even continue?,"Hello everyone, I am currently at a loss and after crying for the last 3 evenings I thought I would need some advice.

I have posted the full story on a different subreddit if you are curious, but the short story:

2 months ago my wife broke up with me after our anniversary trip. It came suddenly. We had no obvious issues in our relationship, had what I thought was a  healthy communication, enjoyed spending time with each other. Honestly the best kind of relationship I could ever imagine. Now after 3 years (1y married) it's over.

The reasons for her leaving are primarily on her (her words, not mine). She feels like she doesn't even know herself anymore and what she wants out of life. I don't see a reason for separation in that. Is it not supposed to be ""in good times as in bad""? It is what it is. Now 2 weeks ago, after a long period of almost no contact, we had a long walk and talk to see where we stand. She said she thought long about it and still has all her issues, is seeing a therapist and still thinks our relationship was wonderful. But she doesn't know what her vision for life is anymore and if I or we are heading in the same direction. Weeks before our breakup she mentioned during sex that she is ready for a baby. Now she doesn't even know if she will ever want them. After that there was no further engagement from her side. Every time I ask her to meet for dinner or a coffee she is busy or postpones it. I feel that she is very confused and I want to be there for her but it is so painful. She feels so cold and distant and I get that she has to prioritize herself now over me/us but still.

On my side, I cried a lot. Am I the perfect husband? Probably not, but humans are imperfect. I was not looking for the perfect wife or marriage. I tried to visit a therapist because of this breakup. Did not help much yet. 

My main issue is that I am feeling like I am putting so much work into this relationship right now, wanting to make it work but I don't see or feel the same effort from her. I understand that she has those personal issues and they have a higher priority for her than us/me. That's difficult and hurts. The therapist is also not helping me sort out my feelings. After 4 sessions I still feel like we are running in circles, talking about the same and asking the same question. ""What do you need right now to move on"" - I don't know. I came here to figure that out üòÖ

I don't have the courage or resolve to break it up. When I think about mentally cutting with her, I feel bad. The time together was great and honestly I would have loved it to stay like this until the end but it takes two to have a relationship.

So here I am. A mess who can't end this relationship on its own because I genuinely believe it is worth saving. Sitting here and waiting for her to either end it or work on it.

Talking about adult things. You can't actually even perceive this post below a certain chrono threshold and, if you did somehow and are, go study for your SAT kiddo, I'll come help later.)

Beginnings are really hard, so let‚Äôs just begin:

**INTRO :**¬†Hi hello, it's¬†[me!](https://imgur.com/a/X66xkE1)¬†I‚Äôm a 29 year old (ancient, I know) who is healed and content and very open to finding his lifelong person and partner. I‚Äôve been through a lot by this point, but I‚Äôve decided the struggle has been for a purpose, to singularly make me a kinder, more empathetic person, capable of caring for others and himself that much more purposefully. There will always be something that happens - I think now it‚Äôs how we choose to respond to it, as individuals and, hopefully, as a duo. If devotion and laughter and always having each other‚Äôs backs is your thing, read on\~

**WHERE YOU AT? :**¬†Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and¬†*the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? ‚Äì \[YES\] :**¬†To me, an ideal relationship isn‚Äôt just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say ‚Äúyeah, might as well.‚Äù It‚Äôs¬†*all*¬†of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as ‚Äúbabe, dude, lover‚Äù all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we‚Äôll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR :**¬†Well if I knew where to find you, I wouldn‚Äôt be scrawling all this! Truthfully, I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image¬†*is*¬†that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior‚Ñ¢! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them,¬†*amazing.*¬†Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :**¬†I will attempt, and fail, to be concise - I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. Let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual. I‚Äôm game for most everything, especially if it‚Äôs nerdy, that‚Äôs the tl;dr. I‚Äôve never been to a concert so, maybe we can solve that.

**CONCLUSION :**¬†If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here. The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose.

That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was.

I was definitely puzzled with making the base layer as directed. It was almost like making a bread dough as opposed to a cake layer. I have just not ever made something like that before! I did not know where to find fresh yeast, so I substituted with about 7g instant yeast. Other than that, the recipe was pretty straight forward.  
I‚Äôm glad I put an extra baking tray underneath. I had a feeling it was going to spill over. The taste of the cake is very good. Not too sweet, you get the cream cheese taste and a little bit of sweetness from the topping. This is definitely something to enjoy with coffee or tea, in the morning or after dinner!

I also took a break for a couple months to try Bloom, since it‚Äôs everywhere on social media and way cheaper. Spoiler: I came back to AG1.

Why I left (and came back):

* I wanted to see if Bloom could do the job for less, and while it was fine for flavor and basic greens, I noticed a drop in digestive support and energy after a few weeks.
* AG1 just feels more comprehensive, the probiotic blend, B complex, and adaptogens work better for me personally.
* Bloom wasn‚Äôt bad, but I felt like I needed to layer in other supplements to match what AG1 does on its own. Bloom actually tastes better.

What I like about AG1:

*Less bloating, better gut health overall
* Energy is smoother, especially if I take it before coffee
* The Next Gen version has more probiotics, added B vitamins, and new flavors (I‚Äôm using Tropical)
* No price increase with the new formula
* Switched to the 60-day subscription (best value at $74.50) which works better with my travel/work rhythm

What it‚Äôs not:

* Not a miracle powder, you still need sleep, movement, hydration, etc. I've been working hard on lowering my heart rate variability and tracking my sleep
* Doesn‚Äôt replace a healthy diet, but helps cover gaps and simplify my routine
* Won‚Äôt give you magic energy overnight, but if you‚Äôre consistent, you feel it when you don‚Äôt take it

If you're thinking about trying it, here's my 
referral code if you want. You'll get a free year's supply of vitamin D3+K2, 5 free travel packs of AG1, and $15 off their first order.
