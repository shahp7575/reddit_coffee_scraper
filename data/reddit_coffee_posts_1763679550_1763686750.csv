1p2kqzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1p2kqzo/cultural_appropriation_help_discussion/,Cultural appropriation help & discussion,"For some context, I am a specialty coffee professional in the southern United States. Located in a city where specialty coffee is just now really starting to grow, me and two of my friends decided to create our own passion project to not only share good coffee, but also to prioritize education and slow service.

Initially, we were brainstorming names for our project, and wanted a short, punchy word. We were searching for words that matched our work’s purpose and represented what we wanted to provide for people. 

After a lot of debate and discussion, we landed on Sora, the Japanese word for “sky”, but also, Sora happens to be a bird native to North America (Sora, Sora rail or Carolina crake is what they are called). Thus, our “mascot” is a bird, but because I create our artwork for the project I tend to draw sparrows (because they’re cool). 

** We decided on this name before we knew about the AI software, also unfortunately named Sora. But we are real artists and creatives and don’t use AI for our branding or ideas. Personally, I see it as a way of retaliating against AI slop by creating real art under the same name. **

Anyway, I recently got told that name is culturally appropriating Japanese culture and can be seen as racist since I am not Japanese and my two colleagues are not either. I can’t speak for anyone, so I’m currently educating myself on the topic, but I am realizing this is a much deeper discussion and wanted input from people not within my tiny social circle. 

Edit: We don’t use other aspects of Japanese culture in our branding or anything. We do strive to provide the same level of service like you’d get in experiences at places like Koffee Mameya in Japan. ",1,1763686622.0,asianamerican,0,1.0,False
1p2kqt9,https://i.redd.it/n4gkjffsdi2g1.jpeg,Eureka Mignon Silenzio 55 or Mignon Specialita [600$],"Hi everyone! I’m new here and recently upgraded my Breville Barista Pro to a Profitec Go with a Eureka Mignon Silenzio 55 grinder.

I only grind one type of coffee for espresso, and I want to use the timer since my girlfriend is also using the setup andI want this process to be as easy as possible. Put the portafilter in the grinder, push the button and wait for the 18g, then portafiler in the machine for the espresso extraction.

However, getting 18g using the timer was quite difficult. Adjusting the time with the knob is a trial-and-error process.

I’m considering exchanging my Silenzio 55 for a Specialita. The Specialita’s more precise and user-friendly timer seems like it would be a better fit for my needs.

I got the Silenzio on a great discount at $485 CAD (~$345 US), and exchanging would cost me around $370 CAD (~$260 US) since I can’t get a discount on the Specialita.

Does the digital timer really justify the extra money, or is the Silenzio precise enough for time-based grinding day after day after I’ve fixed the right setting on the knob?",1,1763686608.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

# Trump Administration Proposes Ukraine Peace Plan Pressuring Territorial Concessions to Russia

# Nvidia’s Record Quarter Fails to Sustain Rally as Markets Reverse Sharply Despite AI Demand Surge

Nvidia posted **blockbuster Q3 earnings**, delivering **$57 billion in revenue**—up **62% Y/Y** and topping expectations—sending shares up **5% premarket**. CEO Jensen Huang pushed back on AI bubble concerns, pointing to surging demand for **Blackwell chips** and reaffirming visibility into a **$500 billion revenue pipeline through 2026**. Management reiterated that **AI spending is accelerating**, not cooling.

But the euphoria collapsed fast.

# Morgan Stanley Scraps December Fed Cut Forecast, Upgrades Nasdaq and Apollo Amid Broad Portfolio Adjustments

Morgan Stanley reversed its December Fed rate-cut forecast after stronger-than-expected jobs data, now projecting **three cuts in 2026**—January, April, and June. Economists cited rebounding payrolls and a **4.4% unemployment rate** driven by rising labor force participation as evidence of labor-market stabilization, reducing fears of a softening economy.

The bank executed a major round of sector rating changes. **Nasdaq was upgraded to Overweight** with a **$110 PT (28% upside)** on expectations of cyclical tailwinds and accelerating Solutions-segment revenue into 2026–2027. **Apollo Global Management** was also upgraded to Overweight, while **MarketAxess** was downgraded to Equal Weight.

# Nvidia Earnings Dispel AI Bubble Fears as Tech Giants Expand Data Center Investments

Nvidia delivered a strong third-quarter earnings beat, prompting multiple analyst upgrades and easing Wall Street concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble. The chipmaker's results led to a 5% premarket surge and sparked a broader rally in global tech shares, with analysts from Evercore ISI raising their price target to $352 and Truist maintaining that Nvidia remains ""THE"" AI company with significant growth potential ahead. The positive sentiment extended across the AI infrastructure sector. Cipher Mining signed an additional 56 MW, 10-year AI hosting agreement with Fluidstack worth approximately $830 million in contracted revenue, with extension options potentially reaching $2 billion for this transaction and $9 billion for the entire lease. TCS secured a $1 billion investment from TPG for its AI data center business HyperVault, with plans for up to ₹18,000 crore in total investment over the coming years. SoftBank announced plans to invest $3 billion to convert a defunct Ohio EV plant into a manufacturing facility for cooling and power systems supporting OpenAI's data centers as part of the Stargate project. Terra Innovatum and Uvation signed a letter of intent for nuclear-powered data centers, while Marvell announced an India hiring spree and R&D expansion to capitalize on the AI boom. Several companies joined Nvidia's Connect program to advance AI capabilities, including authID for enterprise security innovation and Hoth Therapeutics for AI research enhancement. Supermicro unveiled new AMD-powered AI servers, further expanding infrastructure options. Short-seller Carson Block told CNBC it's not the time to bet against major US technology names despite rising bubble warnings. Wall Street firms increasingly view AI transformation as reaching a tipping point rather than representing speculative excess, with some analysts boosting S&P 500 forecasts based on AI's sustained trajectory.

Wage growth showed signs of moderation, with average hourly earnings rising 0.2% month-over-month, below the expected 0.3%, though the annual rate climbed to 3.8% from 3.7%.

# Fed's Hammack Warns Against Further Rate Cuts Citing Inflation and Financial Stability Risks

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack cautioned that additional interest rate cuts could prolong elevated inflation and increase financial stability risks. Speaking after recent jobs data, Hammack emphasized that inflation remains too high and is trending in the wrong direction, with pressure from price increases still significant despite some demand softening. Hammack argued that current financial conditions are quite accommodative and that monetary policy needs to remain somewhat restrictive to address persistent inflation challenges. She warned that easing policy now could encourage excessive risk-taking in financial markets and distort market functioning. While acknowledging the Fed must balance both sides of its dual mandate, Hammack noted specific concerns about elevated leverage in hedge funds and life insurers, as well as emerging risks from private credit markets and stablecoins. She characterized the recent jobs report as somewhat stale but in line with expectations, describing a mixed picture that highlights the challenges facing monetary policy. On a positive note, Hammack observed that banks remain well capitalized, household finances are in good shape, and anecdotal evidence continues to point toward a low-hire, low-fire employment environment. She noted that containing inflation expectations has been beneficial for the economy.

Genuinely looking for advice here from any writers since I'm not sure if I'm to wordy when I write.,"Sunlight streamed through the room like a golden intruder, searching the chambers from the window nearest to the sunrise. This lawbreaker not only invaded the shadows but also interloped into even the sanctity of sleep. Geret rose in an instant; he hadn’t had the time to enter a deeper sleep anyway. The room about him, contrasted with his desires of cleanliness, a mess of clothing piles and papers full of ramblings, doodles, and notes on one thing or another. It was the one room in the house he didn’t keep meticulously clean, and it vexed him endlessly. He went shambling out his door and listed down the stairs, pausing at the bottom to stretch his weary bones.
The downstairs was painted in the same luminous robbery as the above floor, and, for all intents and purposes, refused the right of sleep back to the poor man for even a long blink. Accepting that fate, he defaulted to the process of making his coffee: opening the canister, removing the filter, discarding and replacing the old grounds, adding water to the container on the back of the machine, adjusting the settings to his preference, and then brewing. The water, after it was artificially heated, poured through the grounds and infused with them, creating the bitter nectar of alertness and focus. He immersed himself in a shower. It was hot enough to turn his skin red, and the steam filled the room like a smoker’s paradise. When he had finished his shower, he dried himself and got dressed. He brushed his teeth, flossed, and rinsed his mouth, after which he returned to the kitchen. There, on the counter, in the pot, atop the heater built into his machine, was a pot of dark roast coffee from a brand he neither favored nor enjoyed, but his wallet favored it, so it was his choice.
Interrupting his lack of merriment, his phone chimed. The sound came so suddenly, and was at such an unexpected volume, that Geret nearly jumped out of his socks and caught his phone out of his pocket with such speed as he didn’t even expect himself to use. The screen displayed a notification from his manager. A message in his inbox reading, “Geret, are you available to pick up Terra’s route today? She just had her kid, and I was hoping you could cover for her. Sorry for the short notice. Get back to me.” He sighed at the annoyance of such a thing coming on the same day, but, being as impecunious as he was, he relented his response: “Yeah, I’ll be there.” He only used punctuation when the message was between himself and money.
He was a delivery driver for a local convenience store, one of two. The only other driver was Terra, a woman of her younger years, wed for about four years, having already had one child, and having just given birth to her second. Everyone on Geret’s side of town bought from this convenience store, which was central enough; this meant he always had work when he needed. But, the “Always Low Prices” demanded that employees only be paid as much as was required to get them to sign the papers. That is to say, very little. Luck only favored him in giving him a realtor for a grandfather, who rented him the house for incredibly cheap prices, despite how, even though the house wasn’t by any means large, he could have been making much greater money from it due to its having two floors.
He threw on his uniform, pressed to perfection. After all, he had enough time in his average day, today being the exception, to make sure his uniform and hair were perfect. not yet having had time today to style his hair, he opted to wear a beanie instead. Out the door, to his company pickup truck, he tried his hand at ignoring the biting, aching cold. That insulting villain had been known, at this time of year, to eat the energy of anybody caught in it, and to catch on their hands and nose with an almighty sting. Finally, he drove down the road to the store. He loaded his truck bed with a collection of boxes to be delivered to various locations around the city. Despite how small the convenience store was in comparison to a major outlet store, it carried around about everything anybody needed, and often made deals with other stores in town to deliver their goods for them. The first house, for instance, had ordered flowers from a florist down the street, and the second wanted a small box of what was obviously cutlery.
The third house, however, caught his eye. Obviously, there had been somebody in the house to place the order, and even now, he saw them watching him timidly from the window, but the yard was unkempt and overgrown. A lawnmower was in a patch of grass slightly less overgrown than the rest, and a bird feeder was long overdue for a change. It was nearly emptied, and what hadn’t been removed had congealed into a sort of biscuit in the base of the feeder. The person inside didn’t regard Geret whatsoever, but this was fine with him; he was content enough pretending he hadn’t seen them.
Arriving at the door, there was a brass mail slot on it, which suddenly swung open with a creak. The quick motion made him jump, but he composed himself, took the hint, and fed the long, thin, rectangle-shaped package through the slot. Inside the house, the voice of a young woman said somewhat sheepishly, “Thank you, I’m sorry.” he stiffened back up to his feet and said, “No, it's alright, I mean… delivery is sort of my job.” No response came, and he walked back to his car. He was confused by her tone. This young lady seemed beyond penitent, but there was also a degree of resolve in her voice as she took the package into the house. He didn’t know what he delivered, but clearly she wanted it. And considering how she took it, she needed it to do something she found very solemn. Very solemn indeed.
The rumbling beast known only as Silverado awaited his return and kept him company with its radio until he was finished with his day's work and ready to retire to his home. His driveway lay washed in the beauty of a setting sun, a sight far more welcome to him than a rising one. He lived at ease for a while, but as the evening darkened and the shadows stretched, he became ever plagued by the notion that something was watching him. The feeling crept up and down his spine the entire evening like a leech sucking away at, instead of his blood, his rest, focus, and thoughts. Even his time for dinner was filled with a sense of expectation, like a visitor was soon to arrive, but he hadn’t made plans for any. He scarcely did. Solitude called him by name, and he was never one to deny its loving embrace. How then, now, of all nights, and here, of all places, came a knock on his door. A rhythmical one, with no urgency of tone, but loud and forceful. It came three times, each strike upon, should he have been counting it like musical beats, each second beat. That sense of expectation swelled in him, altogether confusing him, startling him, and seemingly begging him to answer the door.

I am scheduled for lap surgery next year, hence the egg retrievals prior to it as advised by the surgeon.

My protocols: 
Follistim: 225 with Dexa
Menopur: 150
Triggered with Hcg and Lupron.

Been taking prenatals and Coq10 300mg regularly. Half a cup of coffee everyday-I can't give it up. Should I cut this off totally?

Only 6 were retrieved. 3 made to blast, and now, the heart-wrenching result. All were aneuploid. I was too hopeful. I held onto quality vs quantity. 

But reality striked me hard today. This result just shattered my hopes. Been grieving something that  only could have been. 

We've kept this treatment a secret. And I have no one else to talk to about this and I am so thankful I found this group of smart, strong and resilient people.

1p2kmd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1p2kmd3/good_night_love/,"Good night, love.","I don’t know what’s happening, but I need to write this down before I completely lose my mind.

The day was normal. We worked, had meetings, ended the night watching a movie and a silly drama. Around 10 PM my boyfriend said he was sleepy and was going to bed. We usually fall asleep at the same time, but tonight I wanted to stay awake a little longer. I was tired too, but for some reason I didn’t want the day to end.

I was passing the time watching some show I can’t even remember, scrolling through social media, when I heard a noise coming from the bedroom. It sounded like Jaime had gotten up. I thought he might be worried about me since two hours had passed — it was exactly midnight — and I still wasn’t in bed.

I decided to go upstairs before he came down to get me. As I walked up the stairs, I was sure he was in the office, but when I reached the room, he was in bed, asleep — or at least, he looked asleep. The whole room felt strange somehow. The window was open, the streetlight spilling inside. And he was lying on his back, the bed completely untouched, as if he had just fallen onto it. His arms were flat at his sides. It didn’t look comfortable at all, but he has always fallen asleep easily, and he was exhausted. Maybe I was just being dramatic.

Everything changed when I lay down. When I leaned in to kiss his forehead, I could feel him smiling — and a chill ran down my spine like nothing I’ve ever felt. But when I tried to call his name and looked at his face, he still looked fast asleep. Maybe the smile was a reflex from my kiss… but I could’ve sworn he was looking at me. It was dark, though. Maybe it was nothing.

Then, when I settled in to sleep, he wrapped his arm around me — and I have never felt so threatened in my life. His arm over my ribs was heavy, unbearably heavy, to the point I could hardly breathe. I tried waking him up so he’d move even a little, but he didn’t react. He stayed completely still, almost deliberately still. Usually, when I poke him or comment on his snoring, he shifts immediately.

When I finally pushed his arm off, all I could think about was running out of the room. But it made no sense — he has always been the best boyfriend, my best friend. I trust him with my life. Why did it feel like I was in danger, when he was the one lying there, completely vulnerable?

I went to the bathroom to wash my face and take a sleeping pill. Work has been stressful, maybe I’m just not thinking straight. But when I stood up, he woke up and asked where I was going. It was his voice — the warm voice that always soothed me at night — but hearing it terrified me. I wanted to cry. Why am I so paranoid?

When I said I was going to the bathroom, he just turned over and fell back asleep.

I washed my face, but I didn’t take the pill. I felt like I shouldn’t sleep. I really didn’t want the night to end.

I stayed in front of the bedroom door for two minutes, afraid to go back in. I don’t know why I was so scared. In a moment like that I should be asking him for help, begging him to hold me and make me feel safe. But I couldn’t bring myself to touch that door.

Now I’m in the office, writing this. I turned on only a small lamp so I wouldn’t light up the house or risk waking him. But I feel like he’s been awake this whole time. Maybe I’ve been reading too many horror stories, but… it feels like that isn’t my boyfriend. Is that insane?

I don’t know what’s happening, but I’m sure of one thing: he’s standing on the other side of the office door. I can see the shadow of his feet beneath it. And I can hear him breathing. I’ve never noticed the sound of his breathing before, but now it’s the only thing I can hear — that and my own heartbeat.

I should lock the door. And I should stay awake. Tomorrow we’ll probably laugh about this. Maybe he’s trying to scare me — and he’s definitely succeeding. But it’s strange. He would never do something like this. He knows I would hate it. It doesn’t feel like Jaime. Not the Jaime I know.

The morning after, everything seemed normal again. It all felt like a bizarre dream. I ended up falling asleep in the office chair, and Jaime woke me with so much tenderness, bringing me coffee, worried that I was overworking myself. He didn’t remember me coming to bed after him. And honestly, if I hadn’t written everything down, I might have convinced myself I just came to the office to work and fell asleep, dreaming the whole thing.

But one thing wouldn’t leave my mind. I needed to check my notes. I had locked the office door. I’m sure of it. So how did he come in? He brought me coffee — so he had to unlock the door. But we only have one key. Mine. The one I left right on the desk, staring at it while the dread from the previous night washed all over me again.

I had to lock the door quickly, while he was in the kitchen. But even then I didn’t feel safe. I hid inside the office closet.

And I was right from the beginning.

That thing in the house isn't Jaime.

Because Jaime is in here with me.

His body.

But first allow me to paint you a picture. 

I’m 19 male I’m in my first year of Uni I’m not anti social per say but at the same time I enjoy my own company I like to think I’m pretty confident and dare I say decent looking despite this (most likely because of my tendency for solitude) relationships are something which I can say I’ve only experienced once in my life but I doubt that really counted I focused on my work both academic and personal as well as working on myself trying to become a man I’d one day be proud of with me introduced let me continue with the main crux of my predicament. 

I was in a lecture it was early October the lecture hall was packed but there where still a decent amount of seats available I sat near the end of the row 2 seats from the end with these people I’d become friends with on my right this girl comes and sits on the very end of the row leaving a gap between us I think nothing of it it’s normal arguably I should have made conversation but remember solitary character then she talks to me surprised initially we talk for 15 minutes until the lecture starts going over the basic questions despite my solitary nature when I get talking I can talk peoples heads off not to say that I talked over her or fulled up the conversation it was what a conversation should be a equal exchange once the lecture started we shut up I spoke to her as we packed up to leave my next lecture was with the lads to my right so I waited for them to leave I wished her a good day and watched her leave good right a normal decent human interaction. 

The next lecture I sat down in the hall and while I was speaking to the lads I was scanning the hall to see if she was there out of pure curiosity I couldn’t find her slightly dejected although for reasons I knew not I carried on listening to the lecture around 3 quarters through I found myself looking again I was looking for her bottle weird I know but backs of heads are hard to figure out bottles aren’t then I noticed she was say infront of me like directly in-front of me I felt like a idiot literally right under my nose that particular lecture is two lectures in the same room if that makes sense to the lads I had met leave and finally I speak to her from behind the row she was ill freshers flue I suspect same as me I make a joke about being on deaths door she laughs I jump down to sit next to her (I don’t know why but I slid across the desk instead of going around) we spoke again it was like water smooth we spoke about our families films we liked and I showed her how to make folders on Google drive (I really don’t know why I did this) lecture started and once again we shut up I noticed she was on Snapchat at various points talking to someone but I had no clue who it was and not wanting to be a creep I didn’t look fast forwarding to the end of the lecture we walk out together talking about clubs we’re both in we get to a building she’s meeting friends inside I’m going to the library once again I wish her well and continue on with my day and for some reason I can’t get this person out of my head call it what you will but I decide that I liked her energy and I wanted to know more I was committed next time I saw her I’d ask her if she wanted to do something together coffee (never have I had coffee ever) or walking ( I love walking) skipping forward I see her later rhat week in a seminar I’d already settled down and the seat next to me was taken fine I thought I’d ask her after I spoke a lot in that seminar because I really don’t mind talking in-front of people and I have a passion in the subject my answers where all correct so that’s good anyway seminar over I take a while to pack up as I leave I notice she’s already left and is talking to another girl some distance ahead of me fair enough but I’m not gonna try and close the gap and ask her not with a stranger there the next week we share two lectures in one day

 lecture 1) she’s sat on the opposite side of the room to be coming in late I’d already settled down and didn’t want to look a fool walking across the room so I decide to wait for her outside the room pretend I’m looking at a text message on my phone that sort of thing she exists I realise know at this point I don’t know her name so as she walks down the stairs I hit her with a “hey there” and I scare the Jesus out of her I apologised a lot and we have another good conversation but I chicken out on asking her but it’s fine lecture two would be my chance and I said I’d see her there she agreed 

Lecture 2) I walk in with the group of lads I’m normally with for this lecture I notice her on her phone but where she’s sat is a awkward spot which would involve me having to get her to stand to sit next to her (stupid logic I know) I sit in a few rows behind her stupidly I think when she looks around the room she’s looking for me although my brain tells me she’s probably just taking in the class lecture carries on as normal and once again I take to long and she leaves before I can catch her I’m kicking myself but it’s fine the seminar that’ll be my chance 

Then i don’t see her at all not a hint of life bare these incidents 

1) it’s pissing down I come out of the library to go to my lecture I see her walking the opposite direction to me with this guy although neither where talking they where obviously people who knew one another if that makes sense I smile at her she smiles at me I was late but if it wasn’t for that I would have spoken to her 
2) one of my lectures she pops her head in the door to scan her card for attendance and leaves (fair enough that part of the course is crap) 
3) I’m walking home after shopping beer in my backpack my hands red with the stress of carry heavy bags it’s a popular jogging spot for context I’m wearing a cap headphones a red jumper which I don’t normally wear and a grey coat so coupled with my bags I probably looked middle-aged from the back anyway I feel a jogger about to overtake me on the right I make room and they do and it’s her she doesn’t clock me and that’s fair enough I’m not exactly in my most obvious look snd she’s focused on her run but I do stop in the path, slightly in disbelief on Whats just happened and that’s where I am now.

I want closure now shut the door and let me move on or open it I don’t care but I just want a answer more than anything 

My questions with that novel behind us and you guys having a better understanding of the context are these

What should I do?
How do I move on from this feeling if I decide I want to?

My girlfriend (33F) is in a really bad spot and I feel like I’m abandoning her during her struggles. We have been dating for 8 months.

Anyway here’s the story.

She received a settlement from a car accident, in the ballpark of 20 grand. She got this money a few months ago (early July) and decided to quit her day job to focus on some entrepreneurial goals, idk if it matters but she was attempting to be a spiritual stylist/astrologer. She wanted to start a spiritual coffee cart and I told her I’d help but I work a lot of 14 hour days, and maybe that’s a cop out, but I haven’t been able to show up to support that in the best of ways.
I think it does matter me mentioning her endeavors, because I think most people would agree that being a full time spiritual stylist and astrologer isn’t something that becomes lucrative very quickly, if it does.
She uses social media especially TikTok, and passes out business cards to get exposure for her business, 

I was quite worried around the beginning of October regarding her finances and we had some conversations about me being uncomfortable helping her financially if it came down to it.

Well it came down to it, I found out the other day that she’s not going to be able to afford her December’s rent and it’s been a mad scramble on her end to try to figure out where she’s going to work.

I told her at first that I wasn’t willing to help with her rent, but she helped me with some debt when she got the settlement (and I have paid back in full) so I feel morally obligated to help her with this upcoming rent. 

That doesn’t change how I feel about this though, I feel trapped, she’s very integrated with my friends and I know this is going to cause a rift, but I don’t want to continue sacrificing my goals and values to support something that I’m not seeing results from. 

We have other issues, she lives far, and currently doesn’t have a car, but she’s pretty good about using public transportation, so I’ve dealt with that a little. 

I don’t know how to do this without feeling awful, and that I’m abandoning her. I want to give her the rent money as a sign of care and support, and then just walk away from it.

A juddering sound, like plastic teeth chattering. The old inkjet in the corner coughed awake and dragged a sheet of paper through.

Lewis pushed his laptop aside. “I didn’t send anything to print,” he said.

Rain pecked at the cottage windows; the sea muttered beyond the cliff.

The paper slid out.

He picked it up.

LEWIS: “I didn’t send anything to print,” he read. Beneath, smaller type: He frowns. Looks at printer.

Lewis frowned and looked at the printer.

His scalp prickled. “Okay,” he said. “No.”

The printer screamed through another page.

STAGE: He walks to the front door. He keeps his eyes on the page. He leaves. He doesn’t look. If he looks, it can stay.

Lewis stood up. Every muscle in his back burned from not turning round.

He shuffled towards the hallway, holding the paper up like a shield. The corridor yawned, wrong-dark. Behind him, something’s bare feet found the floorboards, half a step after his.

“Keep going,” he told himself. “Just go.”

The printer dragged one last sheet through and jammed. The page hung there, half printed. The machine ground on, like something inside it was trying to push its way out.

**Class:** Keter

**Type:** Reality Bender

**Disclosure:** Restricted

  
\---

# Containment Procedures:

Due to the absolute nature of its anomalous ability, 053-NW cannot be contained by conventional means. However, it remains voluntarily in confinement.

The Containment Cell of 053-NW is a standard humanoid containment model. Items may be provided after approval from the Site Director.

053-NW reacts aggressively to disrespect or mockery directed at other SCPs linked to the group “Apostles of Sakahe.” To avoid incidents, such mentions are strictly prohibited.

In case of containment breach, Thaumiel-Class SCPs must be considered for containment, in the event 053-NW does not return to the cell of its own free will. Due to its partial resistance to Reality Benders, 305-NW, Queen Venatras, must be activated with priority.

  
\---

# Description:

053-NW is a humanoid entity of male gender, blond, with red eyes, who constantly presents himself in formal attire such as suits. He self-identifies as “The Judge of Penance,” the eldest adopted son of Sakahe Won Shifao, and declares his mission to be the judgment of everything that exists.

053-NW is cordial and respectful with everyone he interacts with; however, when irritated or when his judgment is challenged, he can transform into the form he calls Wrath, a massive humanoid creature with heavily developed musculature and rough red skin. During the manifestation of his Wrath, any matter touched by 053-NW enters immediate combustion or fusion. It is estimated that surface temperature exceeds 5000ºC, making any physical approach impossible.

Additionally, 053-NW has the ability to manifest anything he judges to be just. His ability can alter any aspect of reality for his judgment to become real; this includes the creation of objects, sentient life, and even memory alteration or creation of dimensions.

  
\---



# Site Invasion Incident:

Two days after the containment of 050-NW, The Executioner of Innocence, The Judge was discovered inside a containment cell at Site EU-2. 053-NW was found sitting, reading a book and drinking coffee when a staff member noticed his presence through motion sensors. The emergency alarm was activated and MTF EU-N-1 “Valkyries” was the first to respond.

The audio of the interaction was saved for being considered valuable for understanding the anomaly:



**\[Beginning of audio transcript\]**

**Commander Ekrina Varonte, leader of MTF EU-N-1:** This is Commander Varonte, inside the cell, please identify yourself.

**053-NW:** Remain calm. I am here in surrender. I came to fulfill the judgment I decreed for myself. Justice requires my containment, and so it shall be done.

**Cmd. Varonte:** (Turns to guards and operators) Lower your weapons. (Approaches the cell) Can you explain?

**053-NW:** You have my brothers. I am the Judge of Penance, one of the Apostles of Sakahe Won Shifao, the father of truth. I hope this explanation is sufficient.

**Cmd. Varonte:** Not even close. How did you get in? Why?

**053-NW:** It is the Judge’s duty to apply justice, even when it weighs against him. I received from my father the gift of judgment. And I judged that my imprisonment was just. Even against my will, the sentence must be fulfilled.

**Cmd. Varonte:** Can I trust that you’ll stay here until we call the Director? He will want to have a word with you.

**053-NW:** Of course you can. It is the decree I gave; I do not go back on my word. Justice always prevails.

**Operator Tahla:** Commander, are you going to trust him?

**Cmd. Varonte:** If he entered here without anyone noticing, I believe he can very well leave and no one would be able to stop him. Follow basic protocols and lock the door, activate the cell's monitoring system. Call the Director, tell him one of the Apostles is here, treat him with respect.

**053-NW:** You are different from the others, aren’t you?

**Cmd Varonte:** Excuse me?

**053-NW:** The woman in the third row to your left said ‘one of the crazies’. The researcher at the top of the stairs said ‘one of the fanatics’. My hearing is excellent and I know how to judge people, one of the many virtues required of a Judge. You are the only one who treats my brothers as what they are: Apostles.

I will tolerate insubordination toward me, but toward me only. I lost everything I had, (053-NW’s clothes begin to tear and the man grows considerably, eyes igniting in flames, skin turning red and coarse, his voice much deeper) my brothers are the last ones I can call family, I will not tolerate disrespect, and I hope not to hear such profanities again.

(053-NW extends his hand and touches the cell wall. At the exact point of contact, the structure begins to glow red-hot, and seconds later the metal liquefies into magma, slowly dripping onto the floor.)

(Witnesses reported an instant oppressive heat wave, enough to trigger thermal alarms throughout the sector. Reports indicate ambient temperature rose by over 20°C in less than five seconds.)

**053-NW:** I hope I made myself clear.

(The Judge returned to his normal form and a new suit materialized.)

**\[End of Record\]**

# Interview 052-1 with Director Cortez:

**Director Cortez:** You are our... new guest?

**053-NW:** That is one way of putting it. I will be under your care from now on.

**Cortez:** (Looks at the hole in the wall) Can you fix that?

(The wall begins to regenerate.)

**Cortez:** What are the limits of your ability?

**053-NW:** My ability is justice.

**Cortez:** Can you be more specific?

**053-NW:** No, justice is justice. If I can do it, then it is just; if I cannot, it is not. It is not a tool. It is not curiosity. It is destiny. Accept it.

**Cortez:** We just want to understand better about—

**053-NW:** You do not need to understand anything. If you want to understand something, why not understand my father’s teachings? (Materializes a book on the table)

**Cortez:** What is this?

**053-NW:** The teachings of Sakahe. Read it, it will help your ignorance. I recommend surrendering to one of my brothers for purification afterward. My little sister will take care of you then, do not worry.

**Cortez:** We will read it, rest assured. But regarding containment rules—

**053-NW:** (Interrupts with a laugh) Your laws, your scriptures, your rules. Director, all of this is worthless. Nothing I do not recognize can be considered just; only and solely I have the ability to confer true justice. Do not trouble me with your trivialities, and I will remain quiet in my cell. It is a fair agreement, don’t you think?



\---

# Behavioral Observations and Reality Manipulation:

During guard duty outside 053-NW’s cell, the following dialogue between guards and the entity was observed:



**\[Beginning of Transcript\]**

**Agent Letto:** Do... Do you like suits?

**053-NW:** No need to force yourself to address me respectfully. Only low-class judges require useless honorifics. Address me casually.

**Letto:** ... Do-Do you like suits?

**053-NW:** See? The words come more naturally from your mouth. Yes, I like suits. They help me maintain the appropriate image. A judge must maintain composure and elegance, and as the older brother, I must set the example for my siblings.

I cannot present myself around here dressed like you.

**Letto:** Like guards?

**053-NW:** Uniformed pigs, that is what you are. Fix your hair next time you come visit me and polish your boots.

**Letto:** But we normally don’t have time because this base—

**053-NW:** I decree it so, it is just that men have the adequate time to properly present themselves. Therefore, from now on you will have time.

**\[End of Transcript\]**

After the interaction, regardless of manipulation attempts, the agents assigned to the Judge’s cell always have exactly the time needed to prepare before assuming their posts. Missions that interfere with this routine cannot be assigned, as any attempt results in other names being selected, regardless of using humans or machines.

Director’s Note: From now on, guards assigned to 053-NW’s cell will be fixed personnel, to prevent others from being affected.

# Studies on the Book Provided, Sakahe, and the Apostles:

The book, untitled and named Document 053-1, provides multiple pieces of information which, like other recovered documents, do not match historical events.

When questioned about the veracity of the information, 053-NW said: “Ask the Monk or the Orator; if they do not answer, then you do not deserve to know.”

The most important information in Document 053-1 concerns the origin of Sakahe, one of the few details supported by historical records.

Sakahe was supposedly born in Egypt in 2500 B.C., recorded under a noble family. However, texts provided by the Paladin of Heresy suggest his origin to be Babylon. Both documents still exist, but due to fragmentation only small parts of the name Sakahe Won Shifao are visible.

Document 053-1 cites numerous deeds of Sakahe Won Shifao that are historically attributed to other figures:

* Creator of the wisdom texts: deed attributed to Hordjedef.
* Various passages from Alexander the Great’s military campaigns are adapted as religious campaigns of Sakahe.
* The Pythagorean theorem is adapted and attributed to Sakahe.
* The Apostles appear multiple times, in different time periods, often dying during history but reappearing in future fragments with no explanation.

**Director Cortez:** The more I study Sakahe, the more I come to the conclusion that he was either a liar who manipulated the Apostles, or that perhaps Sakahe was not a person, but a collective. What if Sakahe is actually the collective of the Apostles? Or perhaps, the theory I support the most at the moment: Sakahe is the name the Apostles give to every person they met throughout their lives.

If they truly lived all these experiences or have these memories, then it is possible they saw or were manipulated to understand the entire world around them as a single entity.

There is a passage that mentions a hidden tomb in an underground cemetery located in Kazakhstan.

MTF forces were sent to conduct the search.

  
\---



**Note from Commander Varonte:** We almost died because even after everything we went through, we still have members who do not know when to shut their \[Redacted\] mouths.

Speaking \[Redacted\] in front of a literal demon who melts metal like butter. If it had been the Paladin or the Monk, we would have had a battle on that floor.

I recommend severe punishment be issued to the researcher and the operator from my team.

  
\---

# Containment Analysis and Formal Classification Record: 053/1

**Containment Type:** Controlled. The only active precautions involve guard exposure to routine manipulation.

**Maintenance Cost:** Low. Although possibly the most powerful of the Apostles, The Judge behaves as a guest.

**Danger Level:** Global. Any Reality Bender is a threat to life on the planet.

**Autonomy:** Genius. Parallel conversations with guards revealed that the Judge possesses advanced knowledge of the world and even of exact and natural sciences. However, such information is not enough for him to reach the Speaker’s level.

**Containment Escape Risk:** Inevitable.

**Recapture Priority:** Maximum. If the Judge becomes violent, Queen Venatras must be activated immediately. However, I recommend that her contribution not be considered guaranteed. Studies for dealing with Reality Benders must always be ongoing.

**Results:**

**Suggested Class:** Keter

**Analysis Signature:** Doctor Micael G.

**Approval Signature:** Director Henri Cortez

1p2kfep,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1p2kfep/one_month_in/,One month in,"I’ve officially been on the road for a month. I made my way from the Midwest to the Northeast before it gets too cold. Heading down south after Thanksgiving.
What I’ve learned:
- my power station saved my life (by helping to keep me warm). This was the one splurge before I started living in my car and I am so grateful for it.
- make room for a bed/sleeping area, if possible. I slept on the passenger seat for a couple of weeks because I just didn’t have the funds for a mattress. It worked while I had it but once I was able to buy that mattress, I’ve been able to rest better. I only bought a 2 inch double and folded it in 2. I still have to make it better. My recommendation, upgrade as soon as you’re able to.
- there is very little “sun time” in the north in fall. I cannot depend on solar panels to recharge my power station. I stop at coffee shops to work and charge.
- Panera sip club. I got lucky and got the $5/month for 5 months deal at Panera. Good coffee and good drinks throughout the day (every 2 hours)… sign me up.
- if you keep a low profile. Nobody will notice you. I move often, which helps.
- I don’t buy anything unless I’m absolutely certain I need it. Knowing you don’t have the space for it helps so much!
- learning how to eat/change your mindset takes time. I still haven’t figured out a good rhythm for my meals. 
- move in silence. I told just those who absolutely need to know about my plans (significant other and grown children). Otherwise, nobody knows what I’m doing, only that I’m away for a while.

I’m sure there’s way more but I’m proud of myself. I’m one month in and loving every second. The weight of being “me” has lessened significantly and now I’m learning how to be “real me”.",4,1763685786.0,urbancarliving,0,1.0,False

Bemoaning the fact that Cslibre is so freaking open and each person's needs are so different, how to even go about making a user guide? I jokingly thought of a ""choose your own adventure"" model. Like, if you want to learn more about metadata go to page xxxx if you want to continue on, go to xxxxx.  Then I realized that there are ""Types"" of Calibre users. Chat came up with a quiz... 

📚 What Kind of Calibre User Are You?

(The quiz no one asked for but everyone needed)

> You’ve downloaded Calibre. You’ve stared into the abyss of metadata and plugin hell. You’ve screamed into the void when your EPUB didn’t convert right.
But who are you, really? Let’s find out.




---

1. Your ebook folder is:

A. A tidy digital temple. Each file has a name. It brings you peace.


B. A historical archive. Ten copies of Dune, each with a different cover and ISBN.


C. A visual masterpiece. If the cover’s ugly, it’s dead to me.


D. A playground for scripts. I don’t open Calibre; I run Calibre.


---

2. When you add a new book, you:

A. Change the title and author, maybe add a tag. Done.


B. Check for missing metadata, find the exact edition, fix series number.


C. Replace the cover, fix the author sort, polish the summary.


D. Trigger a custom import template with pre-saved plugboard rules.


---

3. How do you feel about plugins?

A. Wait, you need plugins?


B. I’ve got 12 installed. I only use 3, but I have them.


C. Goodreads is essential. Maybe Overdrive. Pretty ones.


D. I edited a plugin's source code to fix a bug. It wasn’t even my bug.


---

4. Series metadata:

A. I don’t care. One book at a time.


B. Must be perfect. Must be numbered. Must be consistent.


C. Only if the cover says it’s book one — then I’ll believe it.


D. I wrote a script to scrape series data from obscure publisher sites.


---

5. You just realized half your EPUBs have wrong page counts. You:

A. Shrug. Who checks that?


B. Manually reprocess each one. Pain is the price of order.


C. If I can’t fix it in the metadata editor, I’m not fixing it.


D. Deploy AskGrok, EPUBTools, and a shell script. It’s
 already fixed.


---

6. How do you feel about Calibre?

A. It’s... fine? It holds my books.


B. It’s my museum. I am its curator.


C. It’s a mess, but it’s my mess — and it looks hot.



D. Calibre is life. Calibre is god. Calibre is bash-scriptable.

Mostly A’s: The Casual Librarian

You use Calibre like a bookshelf. You want it clean and easy. You’re not here for extra steps — just readable files and a working title. You probably don’t even know what a plugboard is, and honestly? That’s okay.

Start here: [Basic setup for Minimalists]
Avoid: Advanced plugin hell, anything labeled “custom column”


---

Mostly B’s: The Archivist

You crave order. You’re the kind of person who sorts your socks by color and fabric. You want perfect metadata, correct edition info, and chronological series tags that would make a library weep with joy.

Start here: [Metadata sanity + essential plugins]
Embrace: Custom columns, ISBN matching, backups
Avoid: Bulk operations without previews. You know why.


---

Mostly C’s: The Curator

You judge a book by its cover — and then you fix the cover. Your Calibre is a gallery. You care about polish, aesthetics, and whether your virtual shelf looks like a goddamn coffee table book.

Start here: [Cover management + formatting tips]
Embrace: Goodreads plugin, series filters, color-coded tags
Avoid: Anything that auto-changes metadata without asking


---

Mostly D’s: The Hacker

You don’t use Calibre. You pilot it. Your idea of fun is chaining plugins into scripts and seeing how deep the automation rabbit hole goes. You have strong opinions about regex.

Start here: [Plugin devs, plugboards, command line glory]
Embrace: Calibre CLI, template languages, shell scripting
Avoid: GUI tutorials. They’ll just slow you down.

I (23F) live with my boyfriend (M25) and his friend (M30). I try to remind myself that this was their place first but sometimes I can’t help but get pissed off with how things end up going. 

It all started when I was starting my work from home job. The way we have the place set up is he has the whole upstairs which is two rooms, my bf and I have the two bedrooms on the floor below and we all share the kitchen and living room. Well roommates hang out area is right above my office and during the middle of the day he had music blaring and was, I’m assuming, jumping? It was obnoxious but I tried to ignore it. 

He also leaves a lot and stays at his parents house since we live in the middle of nowhere. It’s nice when it’s just my boyfriend and I but he’ll leave all of his lights on to “avoid break ins” and leave his dirty dishes either piled on the counter, kitchen table, or sink. He has allergies so we all use separate things so it all adds up quickly in our small sink with no dishwasher. 

Then he stared to use more of our things. He drank almost a whole case of my boyfriend’s coke and just shrugged. He drank the rest of my white claws and just simply texted me “oops”. He uses my coffee maker which is fine but he also uses my sugar and gets it ALL over the place so when the extra coffee drips out after it brews it gets all sticky and he doesn’t clean it up. He finished off my boyfriend’s k cups and didn’t say anything. And the most recent thing is we just bought groceries and I had an avocado. Mind you this was on a spot where the rest of OUR things are stored. He helped himself to it and didn’t say anything about it. Used half one day, put the other half in the fridge and let it get all gross. Regardless, my boyfriend and I have been struggling financially for a while so we don’t have the funds to just go out and replace the stuff of ours he takes. 

I’m getting so fed up and haven’t said anything because I want to maintain the peace but I no longer have my sanity. I wouldn’t care as much if I didn’t have such an awful experience with roommates prior to moving here. I try to talk about it with my boyfriend because it’s his friend and I don’t know him that well but he just shrugs it off and says “he’s my boy”. I’m not one for confrontation and speaking up about these things makes me anxious and the fact my boyfriend doesn’t see the issue here or care irks me. ",3,1763685524.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

1p2ka5d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2ka5d,"My Bestie Stole My Man? LOL, She Can Keep the Trash. I Own the Empire Now.","Five years post-divorce, I ran into ex Derek Vaughn at Prada.


I was buying a tie for my husband when he walked in. The sales girl perked right up.


""Mr. Vaughn! Your wife's suit is ready.""


He glanced at the tie in my hand.


""Add hers to my tab.""


I dropped cash on the counter. ""I'm good.""


He sighed like I'd wounded him.


""Sienna... you still hate me after all this time.""


I smiled.


Hate him? Please. I'd moved on.


Funny—he seemed stuck on it.


---


I shoved the bag into my canvas tote—already stuffed with groceries—and headed out.


By the time I made it to the bus stop near Wicker Park, wind had my hair plastered across my face. Couldn't see a thing.


When I finally brushed it away, Derek's car sat right there. Blocking the curb.


He saw my red eyes, frowned.


""Get in. I'll drive you.""


""Nah, I'm good. Bus works.""


He looked me up and down. Paused at my beat-up canvas bag.


Then, real careful—like he thought I'd lose it—


""You been okay? These past few years?""


""Yeah. I'm good.""


He didn't buy it.


""Just let me drive you. Come on.""


The bus behind him kept honking. Yet he didn't move.


Everyone was staring. Whatever. I got in.


""Englewood. Near Garfield and Halsted.""


He went quiet for a second.


Then his voice came out rough.


""You live there? That area's been rough for years. And you're alone, plus...""


He stopped.


I knew what he wanted to say.


That's where my mom died. Ten years ago today, she wouldn't come to my wedding. Went up to the roof—ten stories—and stepped off.


The backseat was roomy but the heat was cranked way too high. I cracked the window.


""You'll get sick. Close it—I'll turn it down.""


I shook my head, half-smiled.


""Not anymore. Do whatever.""


He went quiet. Then his phone rang.


""Babe, you get the clothes? Where are you?""


The voice through the speakers was familiar—but it had this flirty warmth I'd never heard before.


""Yeah, got 'em. Ran into Sienna. Giving her a ride.""


Pause.


""Wait, Sienna's back? Oh my God, it's been forever. Why didn't you tell me? You're hanging out without me?""


I'd known Paige Hartley for over ten years. Never heard her talk like that.


She used to be quiet. Shy. All about her paintings. When some girl stole her spot in a competition, Paige just hid in the bathroom and cried.


I was the one who grabbed a baseball bat and smashed that girl's canvas in front of everyone. Wrote letters exposing the whole rigged system. Spent three days in juvie to get her justice.


Guess it's true—when someone loves you hard enough, you grow a spine.


""It's just a coincidence. She's busy. I'll be home soon.""


""Come on, we ran into each other—that's fate! What's wrong with grabbing dinner with an old friend?""


""Paige. Don't.""


The line went dead.


Derek always knew how to be gentle when he wanted something. But once he made up his mind? No one could change it.


Paige knew that better than anyone.


The call dropped right as we pulled up to my building.


""Thanks.""


I nodded and got out.


He glanced around the rundown complex. Then called after me.


""Sienna... who'd you buy that tie for?""


""My husband.""


He pressed his palm to his forehead, laughed—bitter, broken.


""Same brand. Same style. You bought me these all the time five years ago.""


""So?""


I looked right at him. Didn't blink.


""You don't gotta act tough with me. After everything, I just want you to be okay. Not... like this.""


Like what?


I caught my reflection in the glass door—


Joggers. Hoodie. Sneakers. Canvas bag full of vegetables.


Looked like every other broke twenty-something in Chicago.


But for someone who used to live in Chanel and Cartier? This was just fine.


I smiled. Wasn't even mad.


""I'm okay.""


His face did something weird. Couldn't tell what.


""Sienna... you've changed.""


""Yeah. I know.""


With that, I turned and walked inside. Didn't look back.


I climbed five flights of stairs and unlocked the door.


Everything looked the same as last year. Same peeling wallpaper, same cracked linoleum.


Mom's photo sat next to the ancient TV in a dollar-store frame. The candle in front of her had burned out.


I lit a fresh one, tied on an apron, and went to the kitchen.


Made roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Her favorites.


Set a plate across from mine at the table. Empty chair. Untouched food. I barely ate.


""Mom, I ran into Derek today.""


Waited. Like she might actually answer.


""I know, I know. But he can't mess with me anymore. I'm not that girl you remember.""


Nothing but silence.


Lost my appetite. Left everything on the table and went to the bedroom. Pulled an old photo album out from under the bed.


""Let's look at the good pictures, yeah? I'm sick of staring at that funeral portrait.""


Before I could open it, a photo slipped out. Hit the floor.


I picked it up.


Derek. Me. Paige.


Three dumb kids grinning at the camera.


I stood in the middle, arms hooked through theirs, laughing the hardest.


Chapter 2


Back then, debt collectors stormed Derek's place, yelling, threatening to break bones. None of the neighbors helped. Not even my parents.


But I did.


The punch meant for his face landed on mine instead.


Tooth shattered. Face stayed swollen for two weeks.


Mom felt terrible. Told me to stay away from the Vaughns.


But Derek's mom—crippled, broken—dragged herself to our door on her knees. Kept bowing, crying, thanking my parents over and over.


So Mom caved.


For almost ten years after that, there was always an extra plate at dinner for Derek. Every Christmas, we bought him new clothes.


When Mom wasn't working, she'd help Mrs. Vaughn run her street cart. If anyone gave her crap, Mom would tear into them so hard they'd never come back.


They called each other sisters.


But no one expected the quiet, stammering ""little sister"" would end up screwing her ""big sister's"" husband.


When I got home that day, everything was smashed. Plates. Chairs. Picture frames.


Mom stood in the middle of the wreckage, sobbing so hard she couldn't breathe. Red handprint across her cheek—sharp, cruel. Dad stood there with another woman in his arms, holding her tight.


""Let's divorce. You can have everything. I just want Sandra.""


Derek, standing next to me, panicked. Tried to grab Sandra Reeves' hand.


But Mom slapped him. Twice. Hard.


I shoved her back.


She hit the ground. Stared at me like she didn't know who I was.


I was crying too. But what came out was worse than any slap.


""Mom, what gives you the right to hit him?""


Memories tangled, froze on that little photo in my hand.


When Derek and I split, I burned everything. Guess this one slipped through.


Before I could toss the photo, someone knocked.


Thought it was Mrs. Garcia from next door—she always comes by this time of year.


I opened without checking.


Paige Hartley stood there, arm-in-arm with Derek.


She had this big fake smile on.


""Sienna! Oh my God, it's been forever! You haven't changed a bit!""


""I dragged Derek here—hope we're not interrupting?""


I stared at them.


""I'm not letting you in. What do you want?""


Paige's smile wobbled. She looked up at Derek, eyes going all puppy-dog hurt.


""She just wanted to see you. Brought you a gift. That's it.""


With that, Derek set a box on the table by the door. Didn't wait for permission.


Paige jumped in, voice all chirpy.


""This skincare set is my favorite right now. Had an extra at home and thought of you. We used to share stuff all the time, remember?""


I glanced down. Same brand my housekeeper uses.


""That photo...""


Paige's eyes went shiny. Tears building.


""Sienna... you still haven't let go, have you?""


I crumpled the photo in my fist and tossed it in the trash by the door.


""Not really.""


She reached out like she wanted to hold my hand. But stopped halfway.


""Look, I know you're still upset with me. Today would've been your anniversary, right? If you and Derek were still together.""


She waited. I said nothing.


""About what happened... I mean, back then... I didn't have a choice. But if you're really over it, let us buy you dinner. Seriously. If you need anything—money, help, whatever—just tell us. We're old friends, right?""


Was about to say no.


Then the candle by Mom's photo popped. Loud.


I smiled.


""Sure. Why not.""


Paige talked way more than she used to.


And her hands were all over him.


Went on about their trip to Santorini last month while dabbing lip balm on Derek's mouth at a red light.


""Every winter. You always forget till I tell you."" She dabbed at his mouth. ""Last time you kissed me so hard I bled. When are you gonna remember?""


He grabbed her wrist. ""Stop it.""


""Oh shoot—"" She glanced back at me, fake smile plastered on. ""Sorry, Sienna. You're cool with this, right? Derek and I—we're just like this.""


I cut her off.


""I'm fine.""


Beat of silence.


""I walked in on you two before. This is nothing.""


Nobody said anything after that.


The car went silent.


Finally. Peace.


I stared out the window, thinking how shocked Mom would be if she could see how much Lincoln Park had changed.


Back then, Dad was hell-bent on leaving her for Sandra Reeves. Nearly destroyed her.


And when she found out Derek and I got married in secret? That's what killed her.


At first, I only hated Dad and Sandra.


They betrayed Mom. Turned her from this unstoppable force into a paranoid wreck who fell apart over every little thing.


Time drained her faster than anyone else. Sucked the life right out.


Later? I hated myself.


After Mom's funeral, I left. Should've been on my honeymoon. Instead, I went down to Florida alone. Stayed a month.


During that time, I never hated Derek.


Not once.


He was just a kid. Trapped. Born into hell with no way out.


Before I left, I asked Paige to look after him.


She did great. In the apartment Derek and I were supposed to share as newlyweds, she moved around the kitchen like she owned it.


I thanked her. Meant it.


That year, the three of us were closer than ever.


Derek treated me better than he ever had.


Used every cent of his first profit to buy me this gemstone bracelet I'd been eyeing.


On my birthday, lit up fireworks across downtown.


Every month when I got my period, he'd cancel all his meetings and work from home just to be with me.


I never doubted him.


Thought he loved me. Really loved me.


Until I showed up at his office unannounced.


Chapter 3


Behind the half-open door to his private lounge—soft moans. Breathless.


I pushed it open.


Two naked bodies. Tangled together.


Couldn't unsee it.


I screamed.


He moved fast. Shielded the woman under him.


""Who the hell let you in?!""


""GET OUT!""


I grabbed everything I could reach. Hurled it at them.


Lamp. Books. Coffee mug.


Blood trickled down Derek's forehead. He never stopped protecting her.


I smashed everything in that room.


But couldn't make myself go near them.


They used to be the two people I loved most.


Fear sank deep. My teeth chattered. Tried to stay calm.


Paige's face was red, soaked with tears. Wrapped in a sheet, she dropped to her knees.


""Sienna, I'm so sorry.""


""Derek and I... we shouldn't have. But we can't stop. We're in love.""


""Please. Let us be together.""


She looked just like she did years ago—


Cornered in that alley. Crying while those girls circled her.


That same year, I became the school psycho just to protect her. Pissed off the wrong crowd. Couldn't walk certain streets for months.


I was the one who handed her my wedding bouquet.


Told her she'd find her own happiness someday.


But now she was in my husband's arms, begging me to let her keep him.


Tears rolled down my face. Voice came out barely a whisper.


""When did it start?""


Her lips shook. Couldn't say it.


Someone else did.


""Does it matter? You done? This is my office. Not your house.""


""Are you SERIOUS right now?! Derek! Does that mean NOTHING to you?!""


I screamed at him.


He stood there. Naked. Shameless. Eyes cold.


""Fine. You wanna know?""


""March last year. You took off to Florida and left me here. That's when it started.""


""I wasn't trying to hide it. Your mom just died—I didn't wanna hurt you more. So I let you keep pretending we had a marriage.""


""Paige has been through enough. I'm done watching her suffer because of me. Was gonna wait till after your mom's anniversary to ask for a divorce.""


""But since you know now, let's just say it.""


""Divorce me. Take whatever you want. I just want Paige.""


That's when it hit me.


That shove I gave Mom all those years ago—when I picked Derek's side over hers—


It was heavier than I ever knew.


Before the divorce, I made sure to burn it all down first.


Snapped photos of them in bed. Printed hundreds. Passed them out to every single person at his company.


Strung up banners outside his office building. Big block letters: CHEATER. HOMEWRECKER.


Reported Paige to her school for ""misconduct.""


Her college forum exploded. Vicious posts everywhere.


At her graduation, I hired someone to loop videos of the three of us—laughing, smiling, happy—on the big screen in front of everyone.


Every memory I used to treasure became a weapon.


But Derek still protected her.


She graduated from one of the top art schools without a scratch.


Was about to debut her own gallery show.


To keep Paige's dream alive, Derek finally looked me in the eye.


""Her exhibition's about to open. This has nothing to do with us. Don't ruin it.""


I was past reason by then.


""Ruin it? Oh, I've got plenty ready. Everyone at that gallery's gonna love what I prepared.""


He slammed papers on the table in front of me.


""You want your mom's grave left alone? Behave. Sign the papers. Stay away from me and Paige.""


When Mom was buried, I was too wrecked to handle anything. Derek took care of it all—including buying the plot.


Turns out even the dead are dealing with real estate drama now. Plots get bought and sold.


Long as Derek signed one document, Mom wouldn't even rest in peace.


I threw coffee in his face.


That night, I slept at Mom's grave. Cried till I passed out.


Next day, I showed up at the courthouse anyway.


Wasn't what I expected though—Derek only gave me one thing. His family's old house.


""You reported my company for tax fraud. Most of my accounts are frozen. This is all I can give you.""


""If Paige hadn't begged me, you'd get nothing.""


I couldn't win against Derek. Never could.


Not since we were kids.


He was smart. Calculated. Used strategy and power to get what he wanted.


I just charged in headfirst. Hurt everyone around me, including myself.


So I shut up.


Sold the house. But before I left for the Florida, went to Paige's gallery opening one last time.

Honest thoughts?,"I don’t usually post things like this, but I wanted to share something personal and get some honest opinions from this community.

A few years ago, I got tired of opening coffee, cereal, sugar, or rice containers and finding them empty - especially on busy mornings when I needed them the most. Every household seems to fight the same battle:
“Who finished it? And why didn’t we know?”

That small frustration eventually turned into a project.

I’m part of a tiny team in Ann Arbor, Michigan - not a big tech company, just a few of us who really love solving everyday problems. We spent the last 18+ months designing and building what we think is the world’s first smart pantry container that can:
	•	track your grocery levels automatically
	•	alert you when a product is running low or about to expire
	•	show everything in a simple app
	•	and even auto-add items to your preferred retailer’s online cart

Basically a smarter way to run a home pantry without surprises.

We finally launched it on Kickstarter two days ago. We’re nervous, excited, and honestly still figuring out how to spread the word. If anyone here is into smart home stuff, organization, kitchen gadgets, or just loves solving everyday annoyances. I’d genuinely love your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions.

Even if you don’t back it, I’d love to hear:
	•	Would you use something like this?
	•	Is the idea helpful or unnecessary?
	•	What features matter the most to you?

This community’s feedback would actually help us more than you know.

Thing is, on my profile I was only looking for friends and I stated this when we met too as I am completely alone in Shanghai. 
This is my first time traveling alone and so far from home and I wanted to meet people to hang out with. I am in my mid-twenties.

The woman looked different but I thought they used older pictures as people do that and I don't care what you look like since this is a friendship only. We agreed to have a coffee and when she pointed to the bar, I said I don't drink, but she said it had soft drinks too and since she's local, I didn't think much of it. When we went in, the usual happened that I read about; curtains being pulled, kept ordering drinks, kept trying to make me drink etc etc and it was all round a horrible experience. 

When the first bottle came out, I recognized the brand as I had worked in a resturant for a bit to pay for my school and I asked her for the price of it. The bill came shortly after to 5600rmb. I said I'm not paying this and she started arguing that she asked me already to drink and I said it's okay if she did but I didn't want to etc. Then she said we need to split it and since the door was blocked, I felt like I had to. 

I feel embarrassed and I am really hoping this doesn't ruin my experience. I am discouraged to meet anyone else or form any friendships at all. Is anyone local that can maybe help me? Can I do anything about this? Thanks in advance. ",1,1763684908.0,shanghai,24,0.6,False

 The short-term rental landscape is evolving faster than ever — and 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for hosts across the **vacation rental agency USA** market. From **artificial intelligence**, **sustainability**, **guest personalization**, and **hybrid travel**, the industry is entering a new era where data, purpose, and human connection converge.  
 For hosts on [**Llivo,**](https://llivo.com) staying ahead of these trends isn’t just about keeping up — it’s about leading with insight and innovation. Llivo’s vision has always been to empower hosts to earn more, connect deeper, and host smarter by blending technology with empathy.  
 In this blog, we’ll explore the top **short-term rental trends of 2025** that every host should know — and how to adapt them to thrive in the world’s most dynamic hospitality market.

https://preview.redd.it/rfkavscs7i2g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f1e0e9d5378ec99589c51b54b24008081822ccc

**1. Data-Driven Pricing and Smart Insights**  
 Gone are the days of guesswork pricing. In 2025, hosts are using real-time **analytics** to set competitive rates and maximize occupancy.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* AI tools analyze booking patterns, event calendars, and competitor pricing to recommend optimal nightly rates.  
* Platforms like Llivo offer integrated insights so hosts can track demand and revenue trends.  
* Predictive analytics help you plan promotions and discounts during low-demand seasons.  **Example:** A Llivo host in Orlando increased annual revenue by 20% by using data-based rate adjustments during major events like Disney Marathons and conventions.  **Related resource:** 5 Ways Data Can Help You Set the Perfect Price for Your Rental.  

**2. Purpose-Driven and Sustainable Travel**  
  
 Modern travelers are choosing **eco-friendly**, ethical, and meaningful experiences over luxury for luxury’s sake. The rise of **sustainable travel** continues to redefine guest expectations.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Incorporate sustainable features such as LED lighting, reusable products, or eco-cleaning supplies.  
* Partner with local eco-tours or small businesses to offer authentic, low-impact experiences.  
* Communicate your values — today’s guests book with brands that align with their ethics.  **Tip:** Highlight your sustainability efforts in your listing title or description. “Eco-Friendly Lakeside Stay” or “Conscious Urban Loft” resonates deeply with travelers.  **Learn more:** The Rise of Purpose-Driven Travel: What It Means for Hosts.  

**3. Hybrid Travel and Work-from-Anywhere Stays**  
  
The remote work revolution has permanently reshaped the hospitality industry. Travelers are now mixing business with leisure — giving rise to **bleisure travel**.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Offer work-friendly amenities: strong Wi-Fi, ergonomic desks, and quiet spaces.  
* Highlight these features in your listing (“Perfect for Remote Workers” or “Work-from-Villa Experience”).  
* Offer long-stay discounts to attract professionals on extended work trips.  **Example:** Llivo hosts in Austin and Miami are tailoring packages for “digital nomads,” including airport pickup, flexible check-ins, and coworking space partnerships.  **Explore more:**[ Explore Remote Work Stays](https://www.llivo.com/p/explore-remote-work-stays)

**4. Personalization Powered by AI**  
  
 In 2025, personalization isn’t optional — it’s expected. Guests want experiences that feel custom-tailored to them.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Use guest data (preferences, repeat bookings, travel purpose) to personalize messages and recommendations.  
* Offer flexible packages like “romantic getaways,” “family retreats,” or “wellness weekends.”  
* Automate pre-stay communication using AI chat tools that greet guests and provide personalized local suggestions.  **Tip:** Personal touches — like remembering a guest’s favorite coffee or noting their special occasion — turn good reviews into great ones.  

**5. Transportation-Integrated Hospitality**  
  
 One of the biggest differentiators emerging in 2025 is the integration of **mobility and accommodation**. Travelers want door-to-door experiences, not fragmented journeys.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Offering airport pickup or local transport options significantly improves booking rates.  
* Highlight pickup or drop-off services directly in your listing description.  
* Llivo’s unique platform model combines vacation rentals with transportation.  **Example:** Hosts who added optional pickup services on Llivo saw up to 40% higher booking conversions and more repeat guests.  **Learn more:** How Adding a Pickup Service Can Double Your Bookings.  

**6. Transparency and Ethical Hosting**  
  
 Guests in 2025 expect clarity — no hidden fees, misleading photos, or vague descriptions. **Ethical hosting** is now a business advantage.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Clearly outline all fees, policies, and terms on your listing.  
* Use honest photography and descriptions — authenticity builds trust.  
* Join platforms like Llivo that prioritize transparent pricing with a flat 12% host fee.  **Insight:** Traveler surveys reveal that 87% of guests say transparent pricing affects their booking decisions more than discounts.  **Read more:** The Future of Rental Transparency: What Every Host Should Know.  

**7. Emphasis on Wellness and Human Connection**  
  
 The emotional side of travel is making a comeback. Guests seek comfort, wellness, and connection — not just convenience.  
 **What it means for hosts:**

* Offer yoga mats, meditation spaces, or calming décor.  
* Embrace Llivo’s mission: “Travelers come as guests and leave as friends.”  
* Create small moments of connection — a welcome note, local story, or thoughtful farewell message.  **Example:** One Llivo host began hosting “community breakfast mornings” weekly — boosting 5-star reviews by 25%.  **Learn more:** When a Guest Becomes a Friend: The Human Side of Hosting.  

**Final Words**  
 2025 is the year of smarter, more conscious, and more connected hosting. The future belongs to those who combine innovation with intention — using technology to serve people, not replace them.  
 By embracing these trends — from **sustainability** to **transparency** and **AI-powered personalization** — you’ll stay ahead of the curve and strengthen your reputation as a forward-thinking host.  
 At Llivo, we’re redefining what hosting means: a partnership between innovation, empathy, and purpose. The more the world changes, the more people seek a sense of belonging — and that’s exactly what Llivo helps you create.

1p2jye2,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1p2jye2/short_throw_projectors_with_large_motorized_zoom/,Short Throw Projectors with large motorized zoom?,"I'm currently looking at regular / short throw projectors for my living room. The issue is my spouse and I disagree on ideal screen size :-) We have space for about 125"" and I'd like to use the entire space for a large screen. However, she feels its overwhelming, and prefers a smaller screen of 75-80"". The living room is 13ft wide, and I'm planning a ceiling mount, so I should be able to use a regular or short throw.

My main requirement is having a powered zoom that's able to cover the range. Powered so that my spouse or I can change the zoom without getting up on a stool or ladder to the unit itself.

This won't be a light-controlled room, so ideally I need a bright projector for daylight viewing. Initially, I'm just projecting on my white wall. I have an old Benq 1080 projector that I bought years ago that we're temporarily just putting on the coffee table, and it works surprisingly well, even in daylight, but I'm looking to upgrade to a brighter 4k and HD projector. Eventually i'll probably get a screen once we finalize all of the room furniture and everything.

So basically my requirements are: about 1:1.67 powered zoom or greater, 4-5k lumens, 4k, HD.

From my research, the Valerian VisionMaster Max seems to fit the bill but is quite expensive at $5k (down to about $4.2k with current discounts). That seems quite steep a price...

The other option was the Hisense C2 Ultra, which is quite a bit cheaper but only 3k lumens which may not be enough for daylight viewing.

I'm considering the XGIMI Horizon 20 Max which is bright, but has only a 1:1.25 zoom.

Curious if there are other options that satisfy these requirements? I'll probably spring for the VisionMaster if it's the only option available, but wanted to see if there are other options I'm not considering, or if maybe the Hisense will be bright enough that I can save a few thousand.

1p2jvjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1p2jvjn/how_absolute_will_unlocks_realworld_manifestation/,How Absolute Will Unlocks Real-World Manifestation,"Here’s a strange little thread I’ve been tugging at lately, and look, it might sound sideways to some folks, but maybe it lands for anyone who’s been spinning their wheels like I was, proper stuck in neutral.

People love to say “just manifest it, believe, visualize, keep your vibe high,” and yeah, same here, did the whole song and dance for years. Nothing budged, not even a millimeter, like trying to drag a sofa through a doorway that’s two inches too narrow. And it wasn’t for lack of wanting, or because I’d botched the technique, which would’ve been easier to swallow, honestly. The real snag only showed its face when I started working with what I call the First Judgment, The Absolute Will, from a bigger framework I named The Great Awakening Manifesto.

Hang on with me a second, this part matters. For the longest time, “will” meant grind harder, clench your jaw, force outcomes till your teeth squeak. Turns out that isn’t will, that’s panic dressed up in a respectable blazer trying to look employed. Real Will has a different pulse, more like actually showing up inside your own life instead of floating three feet above it rehearsing conversations you’ll never have.

Because when you’re not fully here, your energy scatters in ridiculous ways, some of you is glued to old scenes, some of you is forecasting doom tomorrow, and the leftovers pace the hallway pretending everything’s totally fine. Brutal truth time: you can’t manifest a thing if you’re not even in the room. It’s like trying to cook dinner while half the ingredients are, for some reason, wedged behind the couch and the stove isn’t even on.

Every “failure” I took personally wasn’t the universe swatting my hand away, it was me being energetically absent, desire in place, sure, but no anchor, no presence, no Absolute Will. And here’s the part we don’t say out loud enough: desire without Will is just elaborate daydreaming with paperwork.​

Once that clicked, the lights came back on in small, almost impolite ways. The Absolute Will isn’t this cinematic, chest-thumping thing; it’s the quiet decision that says, “Alright, I’m done ghosting myself,” and you gather your scattered awareness into one piece, here and now. That alone changes the weather, suddenly you’re not begging reality for crumbs, you’re shaping it, clumsy at first maybe, but definitely shaping.

You’ve felt that split, right, where you want the thing and simultaneously doubt it like mad. That tug-of-war scrambles your broadcast, your mouth says yes, your history says absolutely not, and the field just shrugs because it can’t read a signal that contradicts itself. When the First Judgment speaks of Will, it’s really pointing at the end of fragmentation, the move from twelve confused pieces to one coherent presence.

Wild twist here: it’s rarely your “want” that blocks manifestation. It’s the parts of you that wandered off and didn’t get the memo. Call those pieces home, even a handful, and things start moving, sometimes at the most inconvenient hour like, “mate, not on a Tuesday before coffee,” but moving all the same.

So yeah, that’s the little hinge that swung the door for me. If you’ve been stuck, maybe it’s not your method, not your mindset, not even your mood board, it might just be you haven’t fully returned to yourself long enough for the thing to land. And that's why I made it the first judgment for its importance, and I called it The Absolute Will. 

there are six more judgments, Shadow Integration, the Silence of Return, Dissolving the Bonds, plus a few that complete the arc, because this isn’t a pile of cosmic rules so much as a live manuscript for the soul still hunting its answer, built to snap illusion’s chains and return you to original purity and sovereign presence.

Together with the Book of Rewards, the full body of work is ""The Great Awakening Manifesto: The Call of The Forgotten Covenant"" (it’s on Google), and it functions like a working map, not a wall poster, you read, you apply, you shift, right where life is rubbing.

With these judgments, you’ll gather your scattered will, reintegrate the power you parked in the shadow, cut those old karmic contracts, quiet the sensory noise that keeps you orbiting reflections, refine desire into sovereign decision, and then actually move, embodying the covenant so what you want has somewhere real to land.",1,1763684336.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I will not drive for about 3 hrs afterward because i think its too dangerous however the police in NSW use drug tests that test over the past 24 hrs (luckily theyrw not very common and i mostly stay in my suburban area anyways) 

My partner 24f is autistic, has a license but cannot drive a manual car(tried to learn but too overwhelming). Whenever i smoke, it means we stay home and eat at home. She usually dislikes this because she prefers to get drive thru for lunch rather than eat a small meal at home. She wont order uber eats bc its twice the cost for the same meal.

Every morning @6am I get our child (2yr) ready for preschool and she vapes and drinks coffee on the toilet. I do the washing, the dishes, and general tidy up after dropoff. My only time to rest is midday when the baby is at preschool and my partner is having her midday nap. Then we go pickup the bubby after school and my partner cooks dinner (im not allowed to cook because she enjoys being alone in the kitchen to cook and ill watch the baby).


She's told me ""i dont like you smoking during the day"" countless times and i agree that i dont like it either but at thia point i feel completely reliant on this routine to get through the day.

For this reason im not having one today, again and i feel so pissed off about it. Am i the asshole for being mad that i cant smoke all day? Does it make me the asshole to have this routine?

1p2jqp5,https://i.redd.it/iklsw42z5i2g1.jpeg,November Kitchen XL,"My November XL Kitchen Box (finally) came in today! I wanted to share some quick first impressions. This month leans really floral in a soft, comforting way, and a few things immediately stood out to me.

My favorites right away are the Hugs body lotion, the Cult Rose glycerin toner, and the Quirk Commingle jelly scrub! Hugs smells so sweet and floral without being heavy, and it feels like it’s going to sit on the skin in such a cozy way. The toner is huge and I love getting skincare in these boxes, so I’m really excited about that one. The jelly scrub reminds me a lot of the passionfruit scrub from the June or July box and I already know I’ll use it constantly.

The only things I’m not super excited about are the rose lip scrub and the Flick hair bombs. I usually love rose flavors, but this lip scrub is a little too powdery for me. It tastes more like an old-fashioned rose dusting powder instead of a sweet lychee or rose-coffee kind of rose. I don’t see myself licking this one off my lips. And the Flick hair bombs sound interesting but the instructions are really vague. They say to put it in an unbreakable container and use it as a final rinse, but it’s unclear if that means a spray bottle or something else. I appreciate the new idea, I just wish it was explained better.

Everything else smells really nice. The bath bomb is strongly floral with gardenia and orange flower absolute. The shower gel looks gorgeous with the pewter mica shimmer, and the soap bar smells soft and floral with rosewood and lavender.

Overall it’s a very floral, pretty box with a few things I’m really excited to use and a couple that just aren’t totally for me.",5,1763683979.0,LushCosmetics,1,1.0,False

1p2jos2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2jos2,"How long is ""long enough""?","I just absolutely adored my boy! I would still be loving him today, but he died in my arms in the early morning hours of November 2nd of natural causes. He was well into adulthood when I got him, and I had him for maybe 8-9 years, so he would have been approximately 15 years old or so, but we never really knew for sure. 

I feel like I have grieved and processed his death... It wasn't unexpected, he had been on ""hospice care"" and had been declining over the course of this year. Nothing really definitive was wrong, just ""getting old"" and two different vets plus a human MD advised me at the beginning of the year that he would probably have ""one good summer"", let him enjoy it as much as he can, but don't be shocked if he suddenly starts to do very poorly after that. They weren't wrong, we decided that we would take care of him at home until the end, medicate as needed for symptomatic relief, and let him be in his own environment. 

So here we are today... I do spend a good amount of time at home by myself, and I absolutely cannot stand the emptiness in this house. It's more than ""missing my dog"" the normal amount to be expected, I'm finding that I definitely benefit from having a companion animal and that a dog-free home is just really not for me. Actually, it is terrible and it completely sucks 😔. I need a wagging tail whacking stuff off my coffee table, and I need doggy steps around my feet when I'm doing things around the house!! I think overall, I really miss the mutual comfort that we share with our furry companions. Of course each one is drastically different, as is the relationship we have with them, and I don't really believe that bringing another dog home is ""replacing"" one that reached the end of their lifespan. I was particularly bonded with this guy because he became deaf several years ago, so we had to pay very close attention to communicate effectively with one another... Lots of nonverbal communication between us, It was so helpful that he was wicked smart and attentive. 

I *feel* like I'm ready to open my home and my heart and get to know another dog, but is it too soon yet?? I've never been totally and completely dog-free before, so I'm not exactly sure if there's some sort of respectful amount of time that I'm supposed to wait or something?? Is there a way to tell if you're actually ready vs. just missing your previous long-time dog? Anyone care to share their thoughts?

1p2jnn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/culture/comments/1p2jnn2/cultural_appropriation_help_discussion/,Cultural appropriation help & discussion,"For some context, I am a specialty coffee professional in the southern United States. Located in a city where specialty coffee is just now really starting to grow, me and two of my friends decided to create our own passion project to not only share good coffee, but also to prioritize education and slow service.

Initially, we were brainstorming names for our project, and wanted a short, punchy word. We were searching for words that matched our work’s purpose and represented what we wanted to provide for people. 

After a lot of debate and discussion, we landed on Sora, the Japanese word for “sky”, but also, Sora happens to be a bird native to North America (Sora, Sora rail or Carolina crake is what they are called). Thus, our “mascot” is a bird, but because I create our artwork for the project I tend to draw sparrows (because they’re cool). 

** We decided on this name before we knew about the AI software, also unfortunately named Sora. But we are real artists and creatives and don’t use AI for our branding or ideas. **

Anyway, I recently got told that my name is cultural appropriating Japanese culture and can be seen as racist since I am not Japanese and my two colleagues are not either. I can’t speak for anyone, so I’m currently educating myself on the topic, but I am realizing this is a much deeper discussion and wanted input from people not within my tiny social circle.

The classified ad was wedged between ""Experienced CPA Needed"" and ""Tax Preparation - Seasonal."" I'd been staring at job listings for three hours, my coffee had gone cold twice, and my landlord's third notice sat on the corner of my kitchen table like a small red guillotine.

""Accounts Receivable Specialist. Unique clientele. Must be detail-oriented, discreet, and comfortable with irregular hours. Accounting background required. Excellent compensation. No agencies.""

The phone number had too many digits.

I counted them twice, the way I count everything. Twelve numbers instead of ten. I checked the listing again online—same number. A typo, probably. Some old immigrant business owner who'd listed their international number by mistake. I'd seen stranger things in six years of public accounting. Not much stranger, but some.

I called it anyway. At that point, I had \$847 in my checking account, \$23,000 in student loans, and a master's degree that had proven remarkably effective at qualifying me for jobs that no longer existed. The recession had gutted the accounting market. The firms were hiring, sure—they were hiring people with five years of experience for entry-level wages, and they were hiring fresh graduates for unpaid internships that might, possibly, if you were very lucky and very good, turn into a \$35,000 position in eighteen months.

I was neither fresh nor experienced enough. I was in the valley between, where careers go to die.

The phone rang once. Not the normal ring—something older, like a rotary phone, or a bell in an empty church.

""You're calling about the position."" It wasn't a question. The voice was male, ageless, and had an accent I couldn't place. Not quite British, not quite anything else. The kind of accent that suggested English was a language he'd learned before it had fully formed.

""Yes,"" I said. ""The accounts receivable position. I have a master's in accounting from—""

""I know what you have, Ms. Chen. I know what you owe. I know what you're worth."" He paused. ""The question is whether you know.""

I should have hung up. That's what I tell myself now, in the moments before sleep, when I replay that conversation and imagine making different choices. I should have recognized the wrongness in his voice, the impossible knowledge, the threat wrapped in courtesy.

Instead, I said: ""I'm worth hiring. I'm detail-oriented, I'm thorough, and I don't quit until the numbers balance.""

""No,"" he said. ""You don't, do you? That's why you're still looking at the Pemberton file.""

My blood went cold. The Pemberton file was sitting on my desk—a freelance job I'd taken on, a small business audit that had revealed systematic fraud. I'd been staring at it for weeks, trying to decide whether to report it or let it go. The client was a family business. Reporting them would destroy three generations of work. Not reporting them would make me complicit.

""How do you—""

""I know many things, Ms. Chen. I know you'll report them, because you believe in the integrity of numbers. I know you'll do it even though they'll never pay your invoice. I know you're exactly the kind of person I need."" Another pause. ""Come to the address I'm about to give you. Tomorrow, 9 PM. Bring your resume, though I won't read it. Bring your questions, though I may not answer them. Bring your integrity, because that's the only thing I'm actually hiring.""

He gave me an address in the old financial district, in a building I'd walked past a hundred times. Then he hung up.

I sat there for a long moment, phone still pressed to my ear, listening to the silence. Then I did what any good accountant would do: I made a list of reasons not to go, and a list of reasons to go.

The ""not to go"" list was longer. It included items like ""obvious scam,"" ""possible human trafficking,"" ""definitely a cult,"" and ""that thing about knowing about Pemberton is really fucking creepy.""

The ""to go"" list had one item: ""\$847.""

I went.


The building was older than I'd thought. In daylight, it looked like every other converted warehouse in the financial district—red brick, tall windows, the kind of place that now housed tech startups and artisanal coffee shops. At night, it looked like something that had been waiting.

The address led me to a door I'd never noticed before, tucked into an alcove between two storefronts. Black wood, no number, no sign. Just a brass knocker shaped like a hand holding a scale.

I knocked.

The door opened immediately, as if someone had been standing on the other side, waiting. But there was no one there. Just a long hallway, lit by lights that seemed to come from nowhere in particular, and at the end, an open door spilling warm yellow light.

""Ms. Chen."" The voice from the phone, coming from the lit doorway. ""Please. Come in.""

I'd like to say I hesitated. I'd like to say some survival instinct kicked in, some primal recognition of danger. But the truth is, I was thinking about my landlord's notice. I was thinking about the Pemberton file, and how he'd known about it. I was thinking about how someone who knew that much about me might actually have a real job to offer.

I walked down the hallway.

The office was wrong in ways I couldn't immediately articulate. The dimensions seemed off—too deep for the building's width, too tall for its height. The walls were lined with filing cabinets that looked like they'd been made before filing cabinets were invented, all dark wood and brass fittings and locks that required actual keys. A desk dominated the center of the room, and behind it sat a man who looked like he'd been middle-aged for several centuries.

He was handsome in an unsettling way, like a painting of a handsome man rather than the real thing. His suit was perfect—too perfect, the kind of perfect that comes from being made by someone who understands the Platonic ideal of a suit. His eyes were dark and deep and looked at me like I was a column of numbers that didn't quite add up.

""Sit,"" he said, gesturing to a chair that I was certain hadn't been there a moment ago.

I sat.

""My name is Ashmedai,"" he said. ""I've been collecting debts for a very long time. I'm looking for an assistant.""

""Collecting debts from whom?""

""From those who owe them."" He smiled slightly. ""I appreciate your directness, Ms. Chen. Most people spend the first ten minutes of this interview asking irrelevant questions about salary and benefits. You want to know about the work.""

""I want to know if it's legal.""

""It's older than legal,"" he said. ""But yes, in the sense you mean, it's legal. I collect debts that are legitimately owed, from entities that legitimately owe them, using methods that are... mostly legitimate.""

""Entities?""

""People. Businesses. Other things."" He leaned back in his chair. ""I'm going to be honest with you, Ms. Chen, because I think you'll appreciate honesty more than salesmanship. The work is dangerous. The clients are difficult. The debtors are often hostile. You'll work irregular hours in irregular places, and you'll see things that will make you question your understanding of reality.""

""And the pay?""

""Enough to clear your student loans in six months. Enough to never worry about rent again. Enough to make you wonder why anyone does anything else."" He paused. ""But money isn't why you'll take this job.""

""No?""

""No. You'll take it because you're curious. Because you've spent your entire life making other people's numbers add up, and you want to know what happens when the numbers don't add up. When the ledger shows debts that shouldn't exist, owed by things that shouldn't exist, for prices that can't be paid in any currency you've ever heard of."" He leaned forward. ""You'll take it because you're tired of the small frauds and the small lies, and you want to see what the big ones look like.""

He was right, and I hated that he was right.

""What would I actually be doing?""

Ashmedai reached into a drawer and pulled out a book. Not a ledger—I'd seen plenty of ledgers. This was something else. The cover was leather, but not any leather I recognized. The pages were thick and irregular, like vellum, and the writing inside seemed to shift and change as I looked at it.

""This,"" he said, ""is the Ledger. Capital L. It contains every debt owed to me, by every entity that has ever made a deal and failed to pay. Your job would be to collect those debts.""

""How?""

""That depends on the debt. Some can be collected in cash. Some require... other considerations. You'll learn as you go."" He turned the book toward me. ""Look at the first entry.""

I looked.

The page was covered in writing that seemed to be in multiple languages at once. But as I focused on it, the words resolved into English, like my eyes were translating automatically:

*DEBTOR: Markov, Yevgeny*  
*DEBT INCURRED: April 3, 1847*  
*TERMS: Seven years of prosperity in exchange for the firstborn child of his line*  
*PAYMENT DUE: April 3, 1854*  
*STATUS: Outstanding*  
*CURRENT BALANCE: One (1) firstborn child, plus interest*  
*INTEREST RATE: Compounding, generational*  
*CURRENT AMOUNT OWED: Seventeen (17) souls, or equivalent value*

I looked up at Ashmedai. ""This is a joke.""

""No.""

""This is insane.""

""No.""

""This is—"" I stopped. ""1847?""

""I told you I've been collecting debts for a very long time.""

""And you expect me to collect... seventeen souls?""

""I expect you to collect what's owed. How you collect it is up to you. That's why I need someone with an accounting background. Someone who understands that debts can be restructured, that payment plans can be negotiated, that sometimes you have to write off a loss."" He smiled again, and this time there was something sharp in it. ""And someone who understands that sometimes, you have to send in the collectors.""

I should have left. I should have walked out of that office, out of that building, out of that entire situation. Instead, I heard myself say: ""What's the starting salary?""

""Twelve thousand a month, plus commission on successful collections. Full benefits. Flexible hours. And most importantly—"" He reached into another drawer and pulled out a small card. ""—protection.""

The card was black, with silver writing that seemed to glow slightly in the dim light. It read: *Bearer is under the protection of Ashmedai, Collector of Debts. Interference will be considered a hostile act.*

""Protection from what?""

""From the things you'll be collecting from."" He slid the card across the desk. ""Take it. Consider it a signing bonus. If you decide not to take the job, keep it anyway. You'll need it.""

I picked up the card. It was warm, like it had been sitting in sunlight. The moment my fingers touched it, I felt something—a subtle shift, like the air pressure had changed, or like I'd stepped from one room into another without moving.

""I'll need to think about it,"" I said.

""Of course. You have until midnight tomorrow. After that, the position will be filled by someone else."" He stood, and I realized the interview was over. ""One more thing, Ms. Chen. If you take this job, you'll learn things about the world that you can't unlearn. You'll see things that will change how you understand reality. You can't go back to your old life, not really. The numbers will never look the same.""

""Is that a threat?""

""It's a warning. There's a difference.""

I left the office, walked down the impossible hallway, and stepped out into the night. The door closed behind me with a sound like a book slamming shut.

I went home. I made a list.

At 11:47 PM the next night, I called the number with too many digits.

""I'll take the job,"" I said.

""I know,"" said Ashmedai. ""Come in tomorrow. We'll start with something simple.""


""Simple"" turned out to be a vampire who owed three months' rent on a crypt in Colma.

""Vampires,"" I said, staring at the Ledger entry, ""are real.""

""Obviously,"" said Ashmedai. He was showing me how to read the Ledger, how to interpret the entries, how to calculate interest on debts that had been outstanding for decades or centuries. ""Though I should clarify—when I say vampire, I don't mean the romantic nonsense you've seen in movies. I mean a revenant. A corpse animated by residual life force, sustained by blood consumption, legally dead but functionally animate.""

""Legally dead?""

""There are laws, Ms. Chen. Very old laws, but laws nonetheless. The supernatural world has its own legal system, its own courts, its own contracts. This vampire—his name is Kristoff—signed a lease agreement in 1987. He's been paying regularly until three months ago. Now he's behind, and the crypt's owner wants him out.""

""Can't the owner just... evict him?""

""The owner is a lich. Liches are notoriously bad at confrontation. That's why he hired me. And that's why I'm sending you.""

""Me? Alone?""

""You have the card. You have the Ledger. You have the authority of my office."" Ashmedai looked at me over his reading glasses. ""And you have a brain, which is more than most collectors have. Use it.""

He gave me an address in Colma, the city of cemeteries south of San Francisco. He gave me a copy of the lease agreement, which looked like a normal rental contract except for the clauses about ""no subletting to ghouls"" and ""tenant responsible for all blood stains."" He gave me a briefcase containing three months' worth of rent receipts, a calculator, and a wooden stake.

""Just in case,"" he said, about the stake.

""I thought you said I had protection.""

""You do. But protection doesn't mean invincibility. It means that if something kills you, I'll know who did it, and I'll make them regret it. Thoroughly. Eternally."" He smiled. ""Try not to die on your first collection. It's bad for morale.""

I drove to Colma at sunset, because Ashmedai had said that was the best time to catch a vampire at home. The cemetery was old and sprawling, full of elaborate mausoleums and simple headstones, and the crypt I was looking for was in the back corner, behind a stand of cypress trees that looked like they'd been planted specifically to create ominous shadows.

The crypt was small, just a stone box with a door, really. The door had a mailbox. The mailbox was overflowing with past-due notices.

I knocked.

Nothing.

I knocked again, louder. ""Mr. Kristoff? My name is Alice Chen. I'm here on behalf of Ashmedai, Collector of Debts. I need to speak with you about your outstanding rent.""

Still nothing.

I tried the door. It was unlocked.

The inside of the crypt was larger than the outside, which should have been impossible but which I was starting to accept as normal. It was decorated like a studio apartment, if studio apartments were underground and smelled like old blood and older earth. There was a coffin in the corner, lid open, empty. There was a kitchenette with a mini-fridge that I really didn't want to look inside. There was a desk covered in papers and a laptop that was playing what sounded like a true crime podcast.

And there was a vampire, sitting in an armchair, staring at me with eyes that reflected light like a cat's.

""You're not from the management company,"" he said. His voice was accented—Russian, maybe, or somewhere near there. He looked young, maybe thirty, but his eyes were older. Much older.

""No,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm from Ashmedai's office. You're three months behind on rent. I'm here to collect.""

""Ashmedai."" Kristoff said the name like it tasted bad. ""Of course. The lich finally called in the big guns.""

""I'm not a big gun. I'm an accountant.""

""Even worse."" He stood up, and I realized he was tall. Very tall. And thin in a way that suggested he hadn't been eating regularly. ""I don't have the money.""

""Then we need to discuss a payment plan.""

""I don't have the money,"" he repeated, ""because I don't have a job. I lost my job. I lost my job because my employer found out what I am, and he fired me, and now I can't get another job because I can't go out during the day, and all the night shift positions want references, and I can't give references because my last employer tried to stake me in the parking lot.""

I blinked. ""That's... wrongful termination. You could sue.""

""I'm legally dead. I can't sue anyone.""

He had a point. I pulled out my briefcase, opened it, and took out the calculator and the lease agreement. ""Okay. Let's look at your situation. You owe three months' rent at \$800 a month, plus late fees of \$50 per month, plus interest at 5% annually. That's \$2,550 total.""

""I know how much I owe. I'm not stupid. I'm just broke.""

""Do you have any assets?""

""I have a coffin and a mini-fridge full of blood bags that I stole from a hospital.""

""That's theft.""

""I'm a vampire. Theft is literally the least of my crimes.""

I sat down in the other chair, uninvited. Kristoff looked surprised, but he sat back down too. I pulled out a notepad and started writing.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Here's what we're going to do. You're going to get a job. I don't care what kind of job. Night security, graveyard shift at a warehouse, whatever. You're going to start paying your rent again, and you're going to pay down your arrears at \$100 a month until the debt is clear. That gives you twenty-six months to get current.""

""And if I don't?""

""Then I come back with the stake.""

He laughed. It wasn't a nice laugh. ""You? You're going to stake me?""

""No,"" I said. ""I'm going to report you to Ashmedai, and he's going to send someone who will. But I'd rather not do that, because I'm an accountant, not a killer, and I'd prefer to resolve this with a payment plan rather than violence.""

Kristoff stared at me for a long moment. Then he said: ""You're serious.""

""I'm always serious about debt collection.""

""You're insane.""

""I'm practical. There's a difference."" I tore off the top sheet of my notepad and handed it to him. ""Here's the payment plan. Sign it, and we're done. Don't sign it, and I escalate this to my supervisor.""

He took the paper. He read it. He looked at me like I was something he'd never seen before.

""You really think I'm going to pay this?""

""I think you're going to try. And if you try, I can work with you. If you don't try, I can't."" I stood up. ""I'll be back in one month to collect the first payment. $900—$800 for current rent, \$100 for arrears. If you don't have it, we'll renegotiate. If you're not here, I'll find you.""

I walked to the door. I was almost out when he said: ""Wait.""

I turned.

""Why are you doing this? Why not just... you know. Stake me and be done with it?""

""Because you owe rent, not your life. And because debt collection is about getting paid, not about punishment."" I paused. ""Also, because I looked at your lease agreement, and your landlord is charging you \$800 a month for a crypt with no windows, no bathroom, and no heating. That's price gouging, even for the supernatural real estate market. You're being exploited, and I don't like that.""

Kristoff stared at me. Then, slowly, he smiled. His fangs were very white.

""You're definitely insane,"" he said. ""But okay. I'll try.""

""Good enough.""

I left the crypt, walked back to my car, and sat in the driver's seat for a full five minutes, shaking. Then I drove back to the office and told Ashmedai that I'd successfully negotiated a payment plan.

He looked surprised. ""You didn't stake him?""

""He's not hostile. He's just broke. There's a difference.""

""Interesting."" Ashmedai made a note in the Ledger. ""Very interesting. Most collectors would have just eliminated the problem.""

""I'm not most collectors. I'm an accountant.""

""Yes,"" said Ashmedai, and his smile was approving. ""You are.""


The second collection was harder.

The debtor was a witch named Millicent Graves, and she owed Ashmedai for a spell he'd provided in 1973. The spell had been a love charm, guaranteed to make her husband faithful. It had worked. It had worked so well that her husband had become obsessed with her, unable to think of anything else, unable to work or sleep or function without her presence. He'd died of exhaustion six months later, still smiling, still whispering her name.

The payment had been due in 1974. It was now fifty years overdue.

""What did she owe?"" I asked, looking at the Ledger entry.

""Her firstborn child.""

I looked up at Ashmedai. ""You can't be serious.""

""I'm always serious about contracts, Ms. Chen. She agreed to the terms. She signed the contract. She received the service. Now she owes the payment.""

""She can't just... give you a child.""

""No. But she can give me the equivalent value. A life for a life. A soul for a soul. Or—"" He tapped the Ledger. ""—she can negotiate an alternative payment. That's why I'm sending you.""

Millicent Graves lived in a Victorian house in the Haight, the kind of house that looked like it had been decorated by someone who'd read too many books about witchcraft and not enough books about interior design. There were crystals in every window, herbs hanging from every doorway, and a cat that watched me from the porch with eyes that were definitely too intelligent.

I knocked.

The door opened immediately. The woman standing there was old—not elderly, but old in a way that suggested she'd been middle-aged for several decades and had decided to stay that way. She was wearing a purple dress and too much jewelry, and she smelled like incense and something darker.

""I know why you're here,"" she said. ""Come in.""

The inside of the house was worse than the outside. Every surface was covered with magical paraphernalia—candles, bones, jars of things I didn't want to identify. The air was thick with smoke and the feeling of being watched by invisible eyes.

""Tea?"" she asked.

""No, thank you.""

""Smart girl."" She sat down in a chair that looked like it was made of twisted roots. ""You're here about the debt.""

""Yes.""

""I'm not paying it.""

I pulled out the Ledger copy and my notepad. ""Ms. Graves, you signed a contract. You received services. The payment is due.""

""The payment was my firstborn child. I never had children. Therefore, I can't pay.""

""The contract specifies 'firstborn child or equivalent value.' You can negotiate an alternative payment.""

""I'm not negotiating anything. That bastard killed my husband.""

""The spell killed your husband. You requested the spell. You knew the risks.""

""I didn't know it would—"" She stopped. Her hands were shaking. ""I didn't know it would do that. I just wanted him to stop cheating. I just wanted him to love me.""

And there it was. The human element. The reason behind the numbers. The thing that made this more than just a debt collection.

I sat down, uninvited, in the chair across from her.

""Tell me about your husband,"" I said.

She looked surprised. Then, slowly, she started talking.

His name had been Robert. He'd been a musician, charming and handsome and completely unable to stay faithful. She'd loved him desperately, the way you love someone who's slowly destroying you. She'd tried everything—therapy, ultimatums, prayer. Nothing had worked. So she'd gone to Ashmedai, and she'd made a deal.

""I thought it would just make him faithful,"" she said. ""I thought he'd just... stop cheating. I didn't think it would consume him. I didn't think it would kill him.""

""Did you read the contract?""

""Of course I read it. I'm not stupid.""

""Then you knew the risks.""

""Knowing and understanding are different things."" She looked at me with eyes that were wet but not crying. ""You're young. You don't understand yet. But you will. You'll make a choice that seems reasonable, that seems like the only option, and it will destroy everything you love. And then someone like you will show up at your door and tell you that you owe a debt.""

I thought about my student loans. I thought about the Pemberton file. I thought about the choice I'd made to take this job, and what it might cost me.

""I understand more than you think,"" I said. ""But understanding doesn't erase the debt. You still owe payment.""

""I don't have a child to give you.""

""Then give me something else. Something of equivalent value.""

""Like what?""

I looked around the room, at all the magical items, all the accumulated power. ""You're a witch. You have knowledge. You have skills. You have connections in the supernatural world. That has value.""

""You want me to work for Ashmedai?""

""I want you to pay your debt. How you pay it is up to you.""

She was quiet for a long time. Then she said: ""I could teach you.""

""Teach me what?""

""Magic. Protection spells. Warding. The things you'll need to know if you're going to keep doing this job."" She leaned forward. ""You're walking into dangerous places, collecting debts from dangerous things. That card Ashmedai gave you will only protect you so far. You need to know how to protect yourself.""

I thought about it. It made sense. And it would give Millicent a way to pay her debt without destroying her life further.

""How long would the teaching take?""

""A year. One lesson a week. By the end, you'll know enough to keep yourself alive.""

""And that would clear your debt?""

""That would clear my debt.""

I did the math in my head. Fifty-two lessons, at what—\$500 per lesson? That was \$26,000 worth of value, which was roughly equivalent to the value of a soul in the current supernatural market, according to the notes Ashmedai had given me.

""Deal,"" I said. ""I'll draw up the paperwork.""

I left Millicent's house with a contract for magical lessons and a growing sense that I was in way over my head. But the debt was being paid. The numbers balanced. That was what mattered.

That's what I told myself, anyway.


The third collection was the one that almost killed me.

The debtor was something called a Redcap, which Ashmedai explained was a type of fae creature that lived in old castles and murdered travelers, dyeing its cap red with their blood.

""There are no old castles in San Francisco,"" I said.

""There's an old fort. Close enough."" Ashmedai showed me the Ledger entry. ""This particular Redcap has been living in Fort Point for thirty years. He owes me for safe passage into this realm. He was supposed to pay in 1994. He didn't. Now the debt has compounded.""

""What does he owe?""

""Seven years of service, or the equivalent in blood.""

""Blood?""

""Fae debts are often paid in blood. It's their currency."" Ashmedai looked at me seriously. ""This one is dangerous, Ms. Chen. More dangerous than the vampire or the witch. Redcaps are killers by nature. They don't negotiate. They don't compromise. They kill, and they enjoy it.""

""Then why are you sending me?""

""Because you need to learn that not every debt can be collected peacefully. Sometimes, you have to be willing to fight. Or to run."" He handed me a small vial of something that glowed faintly green. ""Iron water. Fae hate iron. If things go wrong, throw this at him and run. Don't try to fight. Don't try to negotiate. Just run.""

I took the vial. It was cold, colder than it should have been.

""What if I can't outrun him?""

""Then I'll collect your debt from your estate, and I'll find a new assistant."" He said it matter-of-factly, like he was discussing a budget shortfall. ""Try not to die, Ms. Chen. You're the best assistant I've had in decades.""

I drove to Fort Point at midnight, because Ashmedai said that was when the Redcap would be most active. The fort was a Civil War-era brick structure under the Golden Gate Bridge, all dark corridors and empty rooms and the sound of water dripping somewhere in the darkness.

I had a flashlight. I had the vial of iron water. I had the Ledger copy and my notepad and a pen that suddenly seemed like a very inadequate weapon.

I also had a growing sense that I'd made a terrible mistake.

The fort was empty. Not just empty—abandoned, like something had driven out all the life. No birds, no rats, no insects. Just silence and darkness and the smell of old blood.

I found the Redcap in the lowest level, in a room that had once been a powder magazine. He was small, maybe four feet tall, with a face like a withered apple and eyes like chips of black glass. He was wearing a cap that was so red it seemed to glow, and his hands were stained dark with old blood.

""Ashmedai's little accountant,"" he said. His voice was like rocks grinding together. ""Come to collect the debt.""

""Yes,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""You owe seven years of service, or the equivalent in blood. I'm here to negotiate a payment plan.""

He laughed. It was not a nice sound.

""I don't negotiate with humans. I kill them. I take their blood. I dye my cap."" He took a step toward me. ""Your blood will do nicely.""

I pulled out the vial of iron water. ""Stay back. I'm under Ashmedai's protection.""

""Ashmedai's protection means he'll avenge you. It doesn't mean he'll save you."" Another step. ""And I'm willing to pay that price. Your blood is worth seven years of service. Maybe more.""

He lunged.

I threw the vial.

It shattered against his chest, and the iron water splashed across him like acid. He screamed—a sound that was more rage than pain—and stumbled back. His skin was smoking where the water had touched it, blistering and blackening.

I ran.

I ran through the dark corridors, my flashlight beam bouncing wildly, my breath coming in gasps. Behind me, I could hear the Redcap following, his footsteps quick and light, his laughter echoing off the brick walls.

I burst out of the fort and into the night air, and I kept running. Across the parking lot, toward my car, fumbling for my keys—

Something hit me from behind, and I went down hard. The Redcap was on top of me, his weight surprising for something so small, his hands around my throat. His cap was dripping, and I realized with horror that it was dripping fresh blood. My blood. He'd clawed my back when he'd tackled me.

""Your blood,"" he hissed. ""Your blood for my cap.""

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I could only feel his hands tightening, and see his eyes, black and empty and hungry.

And then I remembered the card.

I pulled it out of my pocket with my left hand—my right was trying uselessly to pry his fingers from my throat—and I pressed it against his face.

The effect was immediate. The Redcap screamed and threw himself backward, away from me, away from the card. Where the card had touched his skin, there was a mark—a brand, glowing silver, in the shape of scales.

""Ashmedai's mark,"" he gasped. ""You bear Ashmedai's mark.""

""I told you,"" I wheezed, my throat aching. ""I'm under his protection.""

The Redcap stared at me with something that might have been fear. Then he said: ""The debt. I'll pay the debt. Seven years of service. I'll pay it.""

""Too late,"" I said. ""You attacked me. You tried to kill me. The debt is now forfeit. Ashmedai will collect it himself.""

""No. Please. I'll pay double. Triple. Anything.""

""You should have thought of that before you tried to dye your cap with my blood.""

I got to my feet, slowly, painfully. My back was bleeding, my throat was bruised, and I was pretty sure I was going into shock. But I was alive.

The Redcap was on his knees now, his red cap clutched in his hands. ""Please. I'll serve you. Seven years. Fourteen years. Whatever you want.""

I looked at him. I thought about mercy. I thought about second chances. I thought about all the things that made us human.

Then I thought about his hands around my throat, and his laughter in the darkness, and the way he'd said ""your blood will do nicely.""

""No,"" I said. ""The debt is forfeit. Ashmedai will collect.""

I got in my car and drove away. In the rearview mirror, I could see the Redcap, still kneeling, still clutching his cap, getting smaller and smaller until he disappeared.


Ashmedai was waiting for me when I got back to the office. He took one look at me—bloody, bruised, shaking—and nodded.

""You survived,"" he said. ""Good.""

""He tried to kill me.""

""Yes. They do that sometimes."" He gestured to a chair. ""Sit. Let me see your back.""

I sat. He examined the claw marks, then pulled out a small jar of something that smelled like herbs and copper. He spread it on the wounds, and the pain faded immediately, replaced by a cool tingling sensation.

""You did well,"" he said. ""You used the iron water. You used the card. You survived, and you didn't compromise the debt. That's more than most collectors manage on their first dangerous collection.""

""You knew he'd attack me.""

""I suspected he might. That's why I gave you the iron water.""

""You could have warned me.""

""I did warn you. I told you he was dangerous. I told you to run if things went wrong."" He finished applying the salve and stepped back. ""But you needed to learn that some debts can't be collected peacefully. Some debtors will try to kill you rather than pay. You needed to know that, and you needed to know that you could survive it.""

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to yell at him for sending me into danger without proper preparation. But he was right. I had needed to learn. And I had survived.

""What happens to the Redcap now?"" I asked.

""I'll collect the debt myself. He'll serve me for seven years, and then he'll be free. Or he'll try to escape, and I'll hunt him down and collect a different kind of payment."" Ashmedai smiled slightly. ""Either way, the debt will be paid.""

He walked back to his desk and opened the Ledger. ""You've completed three collections in your first week. That's a record. Most assistants don't make it past the first one.""

""What happened to them?""

""They quit. Or they died. Or they went mad."" He looked up at me. ""But you won't do any of those things, will you, Ms. Chen?""

""No,"" I said. And I meant it. Despite the danger, despite the fear, despite everything—I meant it. Because for the first time in my life, the numbers were adding up to something that mattered. The debts were real. The collections were real. The work was real.

And I was good at it.

""Good,"" said Ashmedai. ""Because I have another collection for you. This one's in Oakland. A demon who owes child support.""

""Demons have children?""

""Demons have everything humans have, just more of it. And worse."" He handed me a new Ledger entry. ""His name is Baalzephon. He owes seventeen years of child support, plus interest. The mother is a human woman who made a very poor choice at a very dark time in her life. She wants her money.""

I took the entry. I read it. I calculated the total owed, including interest and penalties.

""This is going to be complicated,"" I said.

""Yes,"" said Ashmedai. ""It is. But that's why I hired you. Because you don't run from complications. You solve them.""

I looked at the Ledger entry, at the impossible debt, at the name of a demon who probably wanted to kill me as much as the Redcap had.

Then I pulled out my notepad and started making a list.

Because that's what accountants do. We make lists. We calculate totals. We balance the books.

Even when the books are bound in human skin and written in blood.

Even when the debts are owed by monsters.

Even when the collections might kill us.

We balance the books.

And I was very, very good at balancing books.

Almost 11 years ago, I experienced a very strange and unexplainable situation. It was my first year of university, and I was having coffee with a few classmates in front of the cafeteria. At one moment, I looked inside and saw a person who I felt like I had known my entire life. At that same moment, he/she noticed me too, waved at me, and said, “Wait for me, I’ll come out.”

But as soon as I took my next sip of coffee, it was like my memory was erased. I completely forgot who greeted me, and when I looked inside again, there was no one I recognized. No one came out, and no one greeted me.

And now, after 11 years, I still don’t understand what happened.

Someone went so far as to get an electric tea kettle and asked us all what are preference for tea kettle would be. Then this person said okay got the kettle, maybe you (director) and bring your tea to start at first and then we can all just bring stuff that we have. Director immediately replies: ""Oh I don't drink tea."" Right .....okay! Well we just fell all over ourselves accommodating this request of yours? Fast forward a month, director is walking around with a Yeti mug. I ask ""ah, coffee drinker? Me too."" She says: ""yeah, but I also drink tea!"" It's like what gives? She's exhausting and utterly confusing. Why do things like this? Is she fronting to me to impress me trying to say she drinks tea?

I’m considering USAF, USMC, and Army, but definitely leaning USMC. Despite hearing so much about how bad it can be, I still have a desire to face the challenges and become a Marine. I’m a 6 foot skinny guy and have never been super disciplined and currently am not the most active person. I work at a coffee shop and have a pretty easy life, but since graduating HS I just haven’t been able to figure out what I want to do and I feel like military (especially USMC) would help me get my life on track to be who I want to be.

I would only plan on doing 4 years active duty. Am I stupid for thinking the Marine Corps would be a good choice for my life? 

Also, I have a small patch of self harm scars on one arm. They aren’t very noticeable as they were never deep cuts, but you can definitely see them. It was largely an attention seeking thing when I was 15. I wanted this girl I liked to feel bad for me lol. I never attempted suicide. I did have some childhood trauma from my parents’ divorce but I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years and that has been very helpful. I plan on being upfront about it with my recruiter. Will it be difficult to get a waiver for that?",1,1763683410.0,USMCboot,6,1.0,False

Matcha-may be my favorite? Very close to Princess IMHO. It’s what I hoped D’annam Matcha Soft Serve would be. Like a matcha latte. Very smooth, soft pretty with a distinct tea note.

Bouquet- Maybe second favorite? I don’t think I’d buy a FB. I can’t tell if it smells like toilet bowl cleaner or if I really like it. I need time.

Latte-I definitely get a hint of chocolate. It’s not super coffee forward which I LIKE. I thought I’d like this least but it’s relatively well blended. It’s fine. Wouldn’t get a FB.

Santal-Valaya is that you girl? Immediately I thought “I know this scent!” Smells very similar to PDM Valaya to my nose which is tragic as I wore Valaya when feeling ill with my GLP-1 and can’t stand them smell anymore even thought it’s beautiful.

**Prenatal**

I got my diagnosis at my 20 weeks anatomy scan - as the sonographer took picture after picture of her foot, I could tell something was off. Also, her right foot clearly looked off. As I left the hospital, I called my husband through many, many tears and immediately commenced googling. We knew it was treatable, and we immediately had a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist appointment to confirm it was idiopathic and were sent information for the Shriner’s Children’s Hospital clubfoot clinic (Salt Lake City, UT). The MFM specialist and the internet encourage me to join the Facebook groups. I would wake up at 4AM with my pregnancy insomnia and ruminate on what the newborn period with clubfoot would look like and how to deal with other people’s reactions to the diagnosis that were rubbing me the wrong way. Dealing with other people’s responses was probably the hardest part (more below). I researched and wondered what we’d need to do/buy for our newborn experience and if I was destined to have a grumpy baby who was constantly uncomfortable. We chose to do an informational visit to the Clubfoot Clinic, and they walked us through the process/facility and reassuringly told us that we’d come up with a gameplan once she was born. The MFM specialist had ordered a 30 week anatomy scan to help with “planning the clubfoot treatment,” and the clinic administrator sweetly chuckled that our baby isn’t a patient yet but she’d happily keep the sonogram at her desk as a cute memento (sincere kindness).

*Reflections: My husband did not want to Google or think ahead. He felt like it was unhelpful. For me, I think it was helpful knowing the next steps? I was glad I reached out to the Clinic and did the tour, since it was an entirely new to me hospital. At the clinic was also the first time I heard to* ***not*** *join the Facebook groups. The Clubfoot Clinic pointed out that only people with problems/issues are participating in a Facebook group. You will get worked up with potential worries when your experience will more than likely be* ***entirely okay***. *They also noted that people are generally going there for medical advice (“does this look weird?”) and if you are going through the effort to post a photo and question, use the effort to send to your doctor instead.*

*Edit after posting: If you want information on selecting a doctor or if you have a concern, the Facebook group is filled with so many experienced people that can give helpful second opinions. If you are expecting and in a research binge, remember that you will see a disproportional amount of problems on Facebook. I turned my notifications off and stopped engaging while we were in the ""wait and see"" camp.*

I silenced the Facebook groups and tried to settle with the level of knowledge we had at the time. However, I would cry easily for weeks whenever I started talking about my baby girl with clubfoot in-depth. I consciously knew it wasn’t the end of the world but didn’t want things to be harder and mourned that my second newborn period would be different.

Past the feelings - Since I am a completely normal person who likes being overly prepared and does a bunch of research, I hunted the internet for feedback on “differences with clubfoot baby” (hence I’m writing this as a resource for others).

* My googling gave me two favorite resources that I shared when people had questions (e.g. our moms)
* [https://www.tastefullyeclectic.com/clubfoot-baby/](https://www.tastefullyeclectic.com/clubfoot-baby/)
* [https://nosurgery4clubfoot.com/cheatsheet](https://nosurgery4clubfoot.com/cheatsheet) 
* Bought a bassinet for my stroller - this was truthfully just because I always wanted it. Felt like it was good for baby to move more than in the carseat set up.
* Bought a new bassinet/crib so she wouldn’t mess up anything we borrowed with her bar (heard that babies in boots & bar will bang it on the side of the crib; we had borrowed a bassinet with our first child and he was was still in his crib) - no damage to it yet at 4 months old (2 weeks into boots and bar)
* Went through and sorted baby clothes
   * For the newborn and 0-3 sizes, we kept footies for pre-casting and disagreed on what side zipper would be easier during casting (Author’s note: this would be determined during a 2AM diaper change when my only way to get the cast out of the non-zippered footie was to completely undress the baby since you can’t bend a cast to get it out of the non-zippered pants leg - aka I was right)
   * Pulled out footies for sizes 3-6mo to leave in storage, focused on rompers and outfits with stretchy pants, etc.
      * Made a list on my phone and would specifically ask for rompers when people were giving us hand-me-downs or asking what we needed.
* Continued to talk about her clubfoot with friends/family as it came up - “no, I won’t need a c-section. It’s just her foot.” “No, it won’t get better unless we give her tiny little tools in utero.”

I still had feelings about it all. I got told to stop having a “pity party” and that her clubfoot would “teach me something.” But in reality, people saying the typical thing of “she’ll be perfect!” hit different and I would joke with my husband that we had to fix the effed up foot. People were trying to be nice, but it also felt like denial that we were about to spend a lot of effort and doctors’ appointments to fix her foot. I knew we would fix it, I knew she would be fine. But I did struggle with talking about it with others, because so many people wanted to tell me how it wasn’t “that bad.”

Two weeks after I got the diagnosis - I met with my midwife for a regular check-up, and it actually led to me changing providers. With the best and kindest intentions, she told me that it was the best/most treatable congenital deformity (I noted that “no deformity” still would have been preferred, so I have feelings). That it would make her stronger for it (she’s a newborn, I disagree. It’s just her job to be alive and grow.) And that “at least it’s not your first,” at which point I shut up and wrapped up our appointment as quickly as possible. I was visibly crying during this appointment and felt like I was being told it didn’t matter. If I didn’t feel comforted or heard with this relatively calm scenario, it worried me about how our personalities would interact if things went sideways during labor/delivery. I found an OB in my same practice whose attitude aligned with mine, and she was like “this sucks but we have you connected with resources for treatment,” and we moved on.

*Reflections: With all of this and healthy introspection, I realized the “this sucks” part is what I needed to hear from people. When people kept jumping to the “it will be great!,” I felt dismissed. I knew that I had the resources and that it would be okay, but I also wanted to acknowledge that it would be work. It got easier for me to recognize that people didn’t know what I needed, and I did my best to offer that “this sucks” to friends/family in their own pregnancy journeys when they had bad news.*

**It’s a baby girl! Birth**

This isn’t a birth story, so I’m skipping those details. Ta dah, she’s born.

The clubfoot clinic had told me to call and schedule her first appointment in the first 3 days of her life so I went ahead and did it from the hospital. No big deal, and our clinic asked us to come in at 4 weeks old.

Looking at her, I honestly never thought about her clubbed foot. I thought of moms on the internet talking about how they missed the little scrunched up foot and I wondered if I would. I genuinely felt like you wouldn’t have really known since babies scrunch up all the time. It was just noticeable that this foot never unscrunched when she stretched out.

Ironically, some of the people who gave me the biggest “she’s perfect” and “stop having a pity party” language *were uncomfortable touching her foot* when she was born. I honestly laughed at that and looked at my husband with the biggest “I told you so” eyes and moved on. I didn’t care, I massaged her ankles, I kissed those toes. She was and is my little girl (literally little - born at 4lb 6oz).

We dressed her in all of the cute newborn clothes, and that foot slipped a little easier but no special accommodations needed to be made. In her newborn photos, I asked the photographer to get photos of that scrunched up foot.

**Beginning treatment**

During her first appointment at 4 weeks old, she was up to 5lb but the doctor noted that being small meant there was a higher risk the cast slipped, and we’d end up re-doing casts if so. Based on the doctor’s schedule, we kicked the can down the road for 5 weeks so we would begin casting at 9 weeks old. The doctor had no concern that it would impact her treatment. 

*Side quest of post-partum anxiety. Although I had mild PPA with my first child, it came in* ***full swing*** *with my second. As someone who lives with a “plan ahead” brain but no panic attacks, I legitimately thought I was going insane. We didn’t have family locally, so we did investigate baby girl & me relocating to Texas for continuous support.*

*As we re-evaluated what support I’d need, I reached out to our clubfoot clinic, Shriners, about potentially sharing care with Scottish Rite in Dallas - after a first reply where my issue/request wasn’t understood (they thought we were long term moving), I got a call from a parent mental health specialist at Shriners, and I cannot exaggerate how accommodating they were. She explained she had talked to our doctor and that we could split care between the hospitals; we could delay the start of care; etc. I felt like we had so many options available to us, and we decided to leave her casting as scheduled (my brain would be entirely fixed in the remaining 4 weeks, right?)*

And the first casting was fine! Even with aforementioned postpartum anxiety, I didn’t need any help in the way of Ativan/Lorazepam. I could feel panic in my head, but I didn’t have a panic attack. Baby girl ate a bottle during casting and dealt with it all just fine. My mother-in-law and husband were there for the first casting, and we all agreed she was probably 10% fussier throughout her first week with the cast, but it was all bearable.

\* Note that the casts are first hot (exothermic reaction for the cast to harden so it generates heat), and then the cast is super cold while the moisture evaporates.

Weekly casts and baths - all good! After the second casting, I have handled the remaining appointments by myself since taking off work is really inconvenient every week for his job. It was honestly fine, and I had an easy packing list that fit in a tote bag for castings:

Packing List

* Bottle to feed her while casting - note she fell asleep three of the times she was getting a cast. She had a bottle, and the hospital laid her on a vibrating pad in a warm/cozy blanket. Breastfeeding would have required some gymnastics, so I just pumped when I got home.
* Big cozy towel from home - the hospital provided their towel and a washcloth. Since their towel was smaller, I used it to keep her warm/covered in the bath.
   * Towel also a nice blanket leaving since the cast was still a little messy
* Onesie to put on after casting and wear leaving the appointment (no pants - cast is still drying)
* Diapers/wipes
* Toe nail clippers? - *noted that her toe nails in the cast were getting pretty long and easiest to clip after bath*

**Care During Casting Phase**

For normal care during the casting phase, all of my worst case scenarios didn’t come true. We monitored her and took notes/photos of any redness. If I saw a concerning line of redness that looked like a rash developing, I’d put moleskin at the edge to protect her leg and sent photos to her providers who would tell me what to watch for.

During one of our casting appointments, I heard another family talking about true rashes from their cast, and it gave me some comfort that the effort we were spending paid off. I’m sure part of it is luck, but these things could have been harder and we were doing a good job/got lucky. Note that the doctor was advising treatment/fixes for the other family, and I have full confidence that their kid was fine. The Clubfoot Clinic feels like it’s truly seen it all.

At one point, we did use a [wearable blanket outfit](https://www.carters.com/p/baby-loose-fit-long-sleeve-wearable-blanket-cream/197233320132?cm_mmc=pla.car.us.visitation.Carters+-+US+-+Shopping+-+Standard+Shopping+-+Brand.21028794434...google.Brand_pla&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21028794434&gbraid=0AAAAADzWyhzttRcE8ccCKvO64it9dvvCD&gclid=CjwKCAiAlfvIBhA6EiwAcErpyWGLR4pW-FyNT94eh4UE6EAh0xK3_8bmfT4MJ3r2chU-6qTTx7VmqBoCT7oQAvD_BwE) which caused a blister on her opposite/non-casted heel. I had never thought to check the other leg, and it would have been preventable with putting a sock on that foot. It was truly not a big deal and a funny “ah ha! Should have thought that through!” None of our casts slipped, and we did not need to take off any of the casts early.

***Casting Quick List***

* Clothes - the truth of the zipper
   * Snaps Preferred - After a 2AM diaper change that resulted in a screaming naked baby, we generally opted for sleepers with buttons since they let us get both the casted and uncasted legs in/out easily
      * [Wearable blanket outfit](https://www.carters.com/p/baby-loose-fit-long-sleeve-wearable-blanket-cream/197233320132?cm_mmc=pla.car.us.visitation.Carters+-+US+-+Shopping+-+Standard+Shopping+-+Brand.21028794434...google.Brand_pla&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21028794434&gbraid=0AAAAADzWyhzttRcE8ccCKvO64it9dvvCD&gclid=CjwKCAiAlfvIBhA6EiwAcErpyWGLR4pW-FyNT94eh4UE6EAh0xK3_8bmfT4MJ3r2chU-6qTTx7VmqBoCT7oQAvD_BwE) \- No middle of night buttons but check the noncasted leg!
* Socks! - During the day, I would put socks on both feet because I felt like her toes might get cold on the casted leg? It also meant her cast was not visible at all to the outside world.
* Slept with a Halo swaddle - no issues
* Cast care
   * No more baths - harder to keep private areas clean for girl since I didn’t want to aggressively wipe. This was fine. Annoying but fine, and I just paid extra attention during her weekly bath at the hospital.
   * We got poop on every cast… didn’t use the leg warmers I bought but it never got down the cast or was so much poop that we took off the cast. Just an embarrassing stain at every cast removal appointment (they didn’t care).
   * Any time I had a concern (like abrasion at the top of the cast) - I took photos and messaged my care team. Small tweaks fixed these easily.
* Baby care
   * Didn’t lose any weight the first week - I was told this was normal and don’t worry, but I felt like her not losing weight was a sign of how chill she was
   * She was most comfortable being carried on her side or stomach with my arm between her legs
   * Breastfeeding was fine, and there was absolutely no change
   * Since she was in full outfits (sleepers or pants/socks), no one noticed the cast and I never talked about it with a stranger. I did remind people when they wanted to hold her, so it wasn’t a weird surprise to feel a hard leg.
   * Her 2mo doctor’s appointment was in a cast, which I pointed out that her weight probably wouldn’t be helpful on the growth chart, and we all laughed. All of her vaccines had to go in the uncasted leg, but again all fine!

**Tenotomy and Last Cast**

Ironically my son got stitches the day before from rocking in his chair at daycare, so I felt oddly prepared for her tenotomy. We needed to wait 20 minutes for the lidocaine to kick in, so I carried a sleeping baby around the hospital and got a coffee. When they took her to the treatment room, I didn’t want to go with and watch (I didn’t watch my son’s circumcision? Didn’t feel weird to me), but they grabbed me in less than 10 minutes to come back. She was crying and pissed off but calmed down immediately with breastfeeding then was asleep for most of getting her last cast applied.

The next morning, we noticed she had bled through her cast about the size of a quarter. We used Sharpie to mark the borders and took photos to send to the doctor. Since it wasn’t getting bigger or actively bleeding, we were able to keep her cast on. The last cast, she wore for two weeks and had her biggest blow out yet about 30hr before the cast came off. Just gorgeous smears of yellow poop down the whole cast for the last day.

**Onto Boots and Bar**

When they took off the last cast, the bandage was stuck in the scab so I chose to still give her a bath in the clinic to loosen it up. It worked just fine, and it was nice to transition a clean baby with a cute bow on her head to her new life of boots and bars.

I did get asked to pick a bar type, which I didn’t know would be up to me and hadn't thought about. I went with a nurse’s recommendation to do a Ponseti bar since it’s lighter.

This is the Dobbs bar, which is spring loaded and lets them move each foot independently

They walked me through how to put on the boots, and I had to do it once myself in front of the nurse to show I knew how. The socks that I had brought from reading online clubfoot recommendations were eschewed for having too much of a pattern (that’d be imprinted on her foot), and they gave me socks instead. We wouldn’t check in for two weeks and were told to re-do the boots and bar for every diaper change, so we could get more immediate feedback on our boot tightening (i.e. harder for a blister to form in 2 hours of a poor fit than in 24 hours of a poor fit).

   * No more sleepers; no more footies → googling “sweatshirt rompers” all of the time; [Cloud Island by Target had some since winter is approaching](https://www.target.com/p/baby-bear-building-snowman-sweatshirt-romper-cloud-island-8482-cream-24m/-/A-94706276?sid=2609S&TCID=PDS-336247249&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1241788&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1246984&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=336247249&gbraid=0AAAAAD-5dfaafUKo80_VedTQbllqzyOQw&gclid=CjwKCAiAlfvIBhA6EiwAcErpyTtHZD4IsGPCo_Bsvu_rDGa16EIuHytsAoliWjXAGYGNKI73_-YSZxoC04cQAvD_BwE)
   * For larger sizes, I specifically asked for those as hand-me-downs from friends

* Boots and bar care
   * Things to worry about and take photos of (these went away by the next change usually, so something about how we put the boots on got better)
      * Red circles/blisters
      * Heel in the viewing window at the base of the shoe → if not, you get blisters
   * Things to **not** worry about
      * General/overall redness from tight shoe
   * At each change, my husband and I talked about how we fit and shared tips for getting things to lay smooth while tightening. We also talked about what hole on the boot we were using to maintain consistent tightness.
   * We do our one hour of no boots/bar after bath - baby girl definitely kicks more and seems happier playing. Then lotion and everything suited up for bedtime.
* Baby Care
   * No change in temperament - can put boots on without tears if fed/happy
   * Moved to Merlin Sleep Suit - harder to change diaper but works well with boots
   * She immediately started trying to roll and gets on her side in the boots, which looks quite funny and will probably force us into sleep sacks soon
   * Carrying in wraps/carriers → unclip the bar while getting her in and clip the bar back in whenever she’s ready. I’ve used the Ergobaby carrier just fine, but I haven’t tried a wrap.
* Comments from Others
   * We are asked at the grocery store why we are trying to keep her legs apart. I’ve been asked general “what’s wrong with her?” and been sincerely complimented on her Birkenstocks (i.e. leather boots). In quick passing, I’ll make a joke about teaching her to snowboard. For people I’ll see again, I take the time to explain/remind.

At our two week appointment, we were given the Dobbs bar to use during the day so the hinges of the bar can take the force of her kicking her leg rather than her kicks shifting her heel around in the boot. We got a great thumbs up for putting the boots on tightly and for consistent wear. We haven’t had to take the boots off due to discomfort or crying.

**In Summary**

All in all - yeah, it’s fine. Do I wish we weren’t dealing with it? Of course. We want our babies to be as happy and comfy as possible. Am I glad I researched clubfoot like crazy? Yes, I like being prepared and appreciate having thought through difficulties rather than feeling stressed/overwhelmed in the moment, like realizing that we were going to come home with boots and bar and NOT BE ABLE TO WEAR FOOTIES. We got gifts from family that I already mentally flagged as “we will never wear that” and made a plan to pass it to another expecting couple in the family.

Baby girl is sleeping in a swing next to me as I write all of this, and I catch myself thinking “oh my gosh, she really is perfect.” It bristles me when other people say she's perfect, because it's been a journey but the journey has been fine. (Definitely not fun, but fine) I’m sure a huge part of that is luck, but I’d love to go back and give myself a big hug at the 20 week anatomy scan. We can handle hard things.

**Side note:** Her 3 year-old big brother does not care and doesn't think it's weird at all. He is not jealous of the extra attention or the extra time of mom taking her to doctor's appointments. He talked about how her leg needed to stop bleeding and then the cast will come off (kids' brains are funny). Ladies and gentlemen, the kids are both alright.",2,1763683282.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False
1p2jh47,https://www.reddit.com/r/juicyNYC/comments/1p2jh47/thai_diner_review_a_chef_friend_told_me_its_the/,Thai Diner Review: A Chef Friend Told Me It’s The Best Restaurant in NYC. I was so curious..,"My friend Steven, a chef who knows the NYC restaurant scene inside and out, said it casually over coffee: “Thai Diner is the best restaurant in the city right now.” I couldn't believe it. A diner? In a city of tasting menus and Michelin stars, a diner was the best?

But I trust Steven. So on a Wednesday afternoon around 3pm, I walked into Thai Diner alone, not knowing what to expect. I left two hours later feeling sparkly, like I’d been let in on a secret the rest of the city was still trying to figure out.

# The Scene

[Photo by The Juicy Times](https://preview.redd.it/3sd9trpv0i2g1.png?width=2040&format=png&auto=webp&s=f119f218fa0113d20a2ab23573708ebe382d9a41)

The first thing you notice is the light. It’s a corner spot in Nolita, and the golden afternoon sun streams through the windows, hitting the bamboo-weaved walls and making the whole place glow. It feels less like a restaurant and more like a warm, little island in the middle of the city. I walked right in, no reservation, and found a spot at the bar. The energy was calm but buzzing, a mix of people on late lunches, solo diners like me, and friends catching up. It was busy, but not chaotic. It felt… happy.

# The Experience

I sat at the bar and watched the team work. It was like watching a perfectly choreographed ballet. The service was top-notch, but completely unpretentious. They helped me navigate the menu, cracked little jokes, and my water glass was never empty. I felt immediately taken care of, like I was a regular even on my first visit. This is the magic of Thai Diner – it has the soul of a Michelin-starred restaurant (it’s from the team behind the legendary Uncle Boons) but the heart of a neighborhood diner where everyone feels welcome

What happened next was completely unexpected. I was so taken by the experience that I started chatting with the people next to me at the bar. We talked about the food, about life, about other places we loved in the city. When my dessert arrived – a massive coconut sundae – it felt wrong not to share. I ended up passing spoons down the bar, sharing my dessert with five strangers who, for a moment, felt like old friends. We were just a group of people bonding over a shared moment of joy. That’s the kind of place this is

# The Food

I ordered three things that called to me, and each one told a story.

Chicken Liver Mee Krob: This dish arrived looking more festive than a birthday cake. A beautiful, towering nest of crispy rice noodles, piled high with a rich, velvety chicken liver mousse and fresh herbs, with warm roti on the side. It was playful and serious at the same time, a mix of textures and flavors that was both comforting and completely new.

Stuffed Cabbage Tom Khaa: As someone with Eastern European roots, cabbage rolls are a taste of home. But this was something else entirely. The familiar shape was there, but the filling was a fragrant mix of turkey and mushroom, and instead of a heavy tomato sauce, it was swimming in a bright, limey coconut milk broth with galangal and basil. It was like two grandmas from different continents collaborated on a dish and absolutely nailed it.

Coconut Sundae: This is the dessert that brought a bar full of strangers together. A mountain of coconut gelato, buried under a cloud of palm sugar whipped cream and a shower of candied peanuts. The flavor that lingers is the burnt caramel – a deep, complex sweetness that’s impossible to forget.

# The Juicy Analysis

Here’s how Thai Diner stacks up on the JuicyMeter, my way of rating experiences based on connection quality:

**J (Joyful):** From the golden glow of the room to the playful food and the communal energy, this place is pure joy. I left feeling lighter and happier than when I walked in.

**U (Unique):** The blend of Thai flavors with American diner culture is one-of-a-kind. Dishes like the chicken liver mee krob are unlike anything else.

**I (Intimate):** Despite being busy, the acoustics are great. It’s easy to have a real conversation, and the bar seating is perfect for solo diners or pairs.

**C (Communal):** I shared dessert with five strangers. Need I say more? The design and energy of the place actively encourage connection.

**Y (You-Focused):** The service is Michelin-level attentive without being stuffy. They anticipate your needs, guide you with care, and make you feel seen.

# The Backstory

Thai Diner comes from the same team as Uncle Boons, a beloved Nolita restaurant that sadly closed during the pandemic. They’ve managed to capture the spirit of Uncle Boons – the incredible food, the attention to detail – and put it in a space that’s more open, more accessible, and even more joyful. It’s a story of resilience and reinvention, and you can feel that love in every corner of the restaurant.

# The Practical Guide

**Best For:** Solo dining at the bar, a first date that feels special but not stuffy, a joyful catch-up with a friend.  
  
**When to Go:** Weekday afternoons (like 3pm on a Wednesday) are perfect for walking in. Evenings and weekends are perpetually crowded, so plan accordingly.

**What to Order:** Chicken Liver Mee Krob, Stuffed Cabbage Tom Khaa, Coconut Sundae, Thai Iced Tea.. Learning that Thai Tea French toast and lobster omelet is what people are raving about. 

**Price Point:** Not cheap, but incredible value for the quality of food, service, and experience. Expect to spend $50-75 per person.

# The Reflection

I walked out of Thai Diner feeling sparkly. That’s the only word for it. The golden glow of the restaurant seemed to have transferred into me. It’s a reminder that the best experiences aren’t always the most exclusive or expensive. Sometimes, they’re found in a corner diner in Nolita, where the food is made with love, the service is genuine, and a bar full of strangers can become friends over a shared dessert. My chef friend was right – definitely one of the brightest experiences of the city!",1,1763683279.0,juicyNYC,0,1.0,False

***A flash of light. The coffee maker is back to normal. Kaminari collapses to the ground, exhausted and mentally damaged.***

Bakugo: (Breaks the silence with a laugh that almost makes him fall out of his chair) ""HA! 'THE COFFEE IDIOT'! PERFECT FOR YOUR EMPTY HEAD! DEKU, YOUR QUIRK IS A DAMN WORK OF ART....forget that last one!""

Yaoyorozu: (Observing everything with scientific interest) ""It's fascinating. It not only neutralizes the threat, but improves the overall situation and educates the transgressor... through public humiliation.""

Iida: (Brain stiff, but visibly confused) ""Although the methods are questionable, the result is coffee of exceptional quality and Kaminari has learned a valuable lesson about respect! I can't condemn him!""

***Kaminari looks at Izuku with a mixture of terror and respect.***

Kaminari: ""I will never... never touch a coffee pot again without your permission, Midoriya. I swear.""

***Izuku sighs, looking at his cup of perfect coffee. His Quirk wasn't just an absurd defense system; It was a bureaucratic, paternalistic entity with a sense of humor as black as Kaminari's coffee.

My boyfriend argues that companies use lots of resources and tricks to make food look more appealing in photos, which I do not deny, however this is clearly not applicable to this bizarrely unrealistic picture. Also, the coffee and milk (or creamer, this is on a box of creamer, whatever) do NOT blend like that in real life!

1p2jcof,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1p2jcof/is_it_menieres_or_just_sudden_hearing_loss/,Is it Meniere's or just sudden hearing loss?,"Story time. On Aug 15 this year I suddenly lost all hearing in my left ear. It was out of the blue; I hadn't been sick anytime recently,I wasn't currently sick, I hadn't been to a concert or anywhere with loud noises either. I was sitting on the couch sipping coffee and at once I had the loudest tinnitus I had ever experienced (roaring AND tone) that lasted 15 minutes.The tone stopped and I was left with just the roaring and no hearing at all. I wasn't in pain at all, not even dizzy. That started the next afternoon. After grocery shopping I started to feel off and slightly dizzy. I thought it was mainly dehydration. But as the night dragged on it became vertigo. By Sunday (day 3) it was full blown server vertigo.like couldn't even roll over in bed without getting sick, Monday (day 4) my husband took me to our primary care doctor. After the vertigo test and a full consult, Dr. John diagnosed me with meniere's disease. He prescribed some meds for the nausea, and that was that.

After weeks of calling and emailing, I was able to finally get an ENT appointment for Sept 29th, but they recommend that since their audiologist was booked up, I should get a hearing test elsewhere before the appointment. I did. On 9/15, the hearing test showed that some hearing did come back, but it was moderate to severe hearing loss on the left side. I asked if she thought it was Meniere's and the audiologist said that IF it was, it was atypical Meniere's because my hearing loss is of the higher frequencies and typically you lose the low frequencies first.

On the 18th, the ENT office called and said, ""We got the results from your hearing test back, and it looks like you have sudden unilateral hearing loss and we need to see you asap. Can you come in tomorrow?"" (You mean like I told you in the 3 phone messages and 2 email requests for the appointment you finally scheduled me for on the 30th after we spoke and I told you all of this.) ""Yes of course tomorrow is perfect.""

Sep 19th, the ENT looked at the audiogram and said that it doesn't look like Meniere's, but an infection. The best form of treatment for which is steroids. I opted to go all in and treat it with both injections and orally to try and knock it out quickly since this had gone on a month at this point. Injections: Labyrinthotomy, with perfusion of vestibulo active drug, transcanal (PROC). Shots through the eardrum are not for the faint of heart and hurt like a... well he said ""Like a bee sting."" (I wish) After the injection, I had to lay on my side for 15-20 minutes so the drug could move into the inner ear. The room spins for 5 or 10 of those minutes anyway. I will say I only yelped the first time, and could feel the shot flow into the ear. the weirdest thing to feel it ebb like a wave.

Three inner ear injections and 14 days of oral steroid regimen, with the dreaded ""Roid Rage"" time for the follow up hearing test. IDENTICAL results. NO change at ALL. Cool, ok. Next up the MRI. Oct 9th was that. Came back perfectly normal, no tumors, no sign of stroke, no fluids or blockage of any kind. My brain and inner ears are completely fine and normal.

The ENT office called with the results and said, ""MRI came back and everything is normal. You're good."" And then I sighed and said, ""well normal is good, but I don't know, like this is it? What now, a hearing aid?"" And that's when she said at this time I didn't need to do anything else. No follow-up needed, unless if I wanted to call back in a few days for a consultation, they could schedule it for me. So normal is good news, but frustrating that this is it. So is it Meniere's Disease or just sudden hearing loss?

It's been a journey, to say the least. I got so frustrated Tuesday that I ordered OTC hearing aids from Amazon to see if it helps. Yes the hearing loss is annoying, but the 24/7/365 tinnitus is exasperating. I feel defeated that all of this has been for nothing except for medical bills.

As a curious person who enjoys espresso as a hobby, I've tried nearly every fad gadget or technique that has captured significant attention over the past 6-7 years. This includes different tampers, levelers, WDT, RDT, blind shaker, spirograph tools, precision baskets, slow-feed, variable RPM, refractometers, water recipes, paper filters, shower screens, the new best grinder or burr, etc. If I'm being honest, even if I enjoy some of these things, many of them have had no perceivable impact in the cup, weren't worth the effort, or created a different, not better, experience (excluding good water and a decent grinder).

I recently bought the Graph step-down basket (58mm>46mm) with the idea that it should at least be more forgiving with lower doses. I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations. The forgiveness and range I'm experiencing with coffees I've struggled to get positive results from is exceptional. For example, I just pulled a shot with a light-roasted Ethiopian natural that I could not get right with my 58mm basket. I thought the shot was ruined because I got 30g in 42 seconds from a 17 gram dose. Instead, the shot was sweet, thick, and juicy. There was a very mild bitterness that could likely be addressed by grinding coarser, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I generally wouldn't expect that much contact time on a natural coffee to produce a good result.

Do you need a step-down basket? No. If you're willing to pull 20-25+ gram shots all the time, I don't think this is going to help you at all. That being said, coffee is expensive, and I don't really want to consume a massive amount of caffeine every day. For me, this is the best coffee ""gadget"" I've bought since getting my first capable grinder. Without any extra steps or sacrifices in body or texture, I'm making more enjoyable shots, and I'm less hesitant to try a wide range of coffee on espresso.",6,1763682914.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1p2j8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p2j8pu/they_dont_want_us_to_know/,They don’t want us to know,"It is apparent today more than ever that our government has its own agenda against the American people. They would rather control and manipulate the ones they're supposed to protect. Stealing, murder and experimentation are just some of the things they are guilty of. That's why I've decided to share a story that happened to me in my twenties. My father had recently passed and left me the family farm. It was about twenty acres with cows, pigs and chickens. I'd always planned to take over the family business but it happened sooner than I expected.

After a long day of tending to the many animals. I was sitting on my porch; gazing up at the moon. It was hard work managing so much on your own. But memories of my old dad kept me going. I remember it was almost nine o'clock and I was about to call it a night. I took one last look at the starry sky before noticing something peculiar. A giant ball of fire came into view, instantly grabbing my attention. “Was this some kind of meteor?”, I wondered. As I watched, it made strange movements. Whizzing back and forth or staying perfectly still. But the fire got bigger very fast, causing the object to crash into my cow field. What came after was a large explosion that sent all of my animals into a frenzy.

I grabbed a flashlight and my fathers rifle before rushing to the scene. What I saw there was something no one would ever believe. It was a metallic and circular object that was cracked open like an egg. As I moved closer, I was able to see inside. There were blinking lights, a small seat and what seemed to be tiny controls. Before I could study this strange object, a voice called out to me. It was asking for help and nearly made me jump out of my skin. This is due to the fact that it didn't come from anywhere in the field. But instead, the voice called out to me in my own head. I darted around like a mad man thinking I'd gone crazy.

But it was quick to calm me and promised I was alright. “It's okay, I'm hurt…come to me”. Like I was hypnotized, I turned and walked a few feet away from the destroyed object. Laying on the edge of the crater was something out of this world. A small being about three feet tall, it had big bulging eyes and a giant head. Its body was covered in deep gashes from the crash. There was a strange grey liquid oozing from its wounds; I assumed it was blood. I kneeled down beside it, unsure of what to do. It slowly raised its three fingered hand and I grabbed onto it. His skin was grey and oily to the touch. It locked eyes with me before speaking telepathically again.

“I'm in so much pain human…I need you to finish me”. I don't know what most folks would have done, but I didn't want to hurt this creature. I explained that I could call for help, that a hospital could save him. But alas, his words echoed in my head over and over. He was dying and wanted me to end his suffering. So I gripped my fathers rifle and did what needed to be done. Unsure of what to do next, I called the police. The operator thought I was crazy but you could see the smoke from miles away. So they had to send someone out. One cop car quickly turned into two then three. The officers stood over the wreckage confused and scared. I didn't blame them, I still didn't know what to make of all this.

Pretty soon, military vehicles pulled down my one way driveway. They parked in a way that was blocking us from viewing the wreckage. I sat on my porch for forever wondering what was going to happen. There were cops, government men in black suits. And at one point, even guys in hazmat suits. I was never into the paranormal, but even I knew something odd was going on here. That thing wasn't from this world and they knew that. Hours passed and it was after 2 am. A cop came up to me and told me everything was taken care of. He also said that there were gonna be some people here to talk to me first thing in the morning.

He was right about that, the very next day I got a knock at my door. It was a man dressed in a black suit holding a briefcase. He told me his name was frank and asked if he could come inside. I invited him in and put on some coffee. He took it black and sat at the table with a tired expression. “Im just gonna get straight to the point”, he said. “Your land is of interest to the federal government. We'd like to offer you a substantial amount to buy it”. He then put a briefcase on the table and opened it up. There was so much money that I nearly passed out. Stacks upon stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. The man handed me a clipboard and told me to sign on the dotted line.

All that money seemed life changing, but money couldn't make up for memories. My dad worked hard to build this place and I had no right to sell it. I wiped the drool from my face and pushed the briefcase away. I explained that this was family land and I couldn't part with it. He let out a sigh and dropped his head. “That’s very unfortunate to hear. The money was worth far more than this dried up old land”. After offending me, he took the money and left. Things soon went back to normal, or so I thought. I got up early and tended to my farm like always. Feeding all the animals and cleaning up after them. The first thing I noticed was that big eighteen wheelers passed in front of my home.

There were fleets of four and five followed by military vehicles. A different construction company rolled through everyday. Late at night I could hear helicopters flying over my property. So close that my entire house was shaking. My animals stayed spooked and running all over the place. I had no idea what they were doing; there were only woods out here. Things went like this for five months straight; then I’d receive one last visit. Another black vehicle carrying my new buddy Frank. Only this time, he was accompanied by two armed soldiers. He greeted me with a handshake and a smile. Then held up a stack of papers that would change my life. He said that my farm was on military property and I needed to leave. I told him he's crazy, this farm was built by my father forty years ago. He referred to the papers again, assuring me this land had always belonged to uncle sam. I told him he needed to leave now before I called the police. The soldiers stepped up and told me I would be the one leaving. They stuck their rifles in my face and escorted me to my truck. 

What was happening, this was my home and they were taking it from me? I went to the police, lawyers, no one wanted to help me. Next thing I knew I was on the streets with nowhere to go. As of my writing this, I'm living in a rundown apartment and working at a grocery store. I've gone back to my home several times and have been turned away. A giant fence was installed and I couldn't have any of my belongings. The worst part is, I know this is my land. But I don't have any evidence to prove it...they took everything. This all started when I discovered that creature. Perhaps they thought my land was a hot bed for extraterrestrials. And the US government wanted it no matter how low they had to sink.

Regardless, my life was stolen and I'm ready to tell my story. In this country we're supposed to feel safe and live free. But there is a monster lurking just beneath the surface. One that will take what they want when they want and answer to nobody. One nation under lies and control; fight back and they’ll bury you…just like me.",3,1763682684.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1p2j8h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p2j8h1/analysis_paralysis_w_grinder_choice_us_600/,"Analysis paralysis w/ grinder choice [US $600, flexible]","I'm in the market for a new grinder, as I am going to get an espresso machine for the first time around Christmas (leaning towards Gaggia Classic w/ Gaggimate upgrades later). I've been doing filter and French press for several years now, and I've used a hand grinder up to this point. I started out with the 1zpresso JX-Pro, which I liked, but unfortunately did not survive a run in with an old roommate cleaning it with water. I currently have the 1zpresso J, which I do not like as much and also isn't sufficient for espresso.

I'm looking for an all-rounder that can replace the J for any filter or French press I'd be looking to do, but ultimately will mostly be used for espresso (straight espresso or Americano). I've found the following based on community opinion + some reviewer opinions, but unsure of what to land on. I listed some of the holdups for me under each one.

Electric

* Timemore 064s (over 078s largely for price reasons) ($480 on Amazon)
   * A reasonable number of negative opinions found online, now that the hype has died down a bit.
* Gevi VelPro 400 ($450 on their website)
   * Not many reviews or community opinions on this one.

Handgrinders

* Kinu M47 ($200-350 depending on model, unsure of what the differences amount to)
   * Feels like the community has moved on from this one due to price.
* Orphan Espresso Lido OG ($273)
   * Not many reviews or community opinions.

I understand the other 1zpresso grinders are pretty highly rated for espresso right now, but honestly I've only ever had coffee from 1zpresso at this point and want to try something new.

I'm curious about people's experiences with one or multiple of these, or any additional recommendations. I'm not married to either electric or hand grinders, I've ground espresso fine with hand grinders before (on accident) and it's not really a sticking point for me. And the value proposition of not having to pay for extra material / electric motors is definitely attractive. However, I'm interested in trying flat burrs, I think I would enjoy the clarity.",1,1763682667.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1p2j8eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p2j8eo/aitah_for_not_wanting_my_fiancés_parents_around/,AITAH For Not Wanting My Fiancés Parents Around Our Son,"I really hesitated to post this because I’m naturally an anxious person but it is a pretty wild story and I think people might find it interesting and also relate to it. 

Sorry if everything is kind of jumbled together. I wrote it out in my pages app then copied and pasted which seems to have deleted some of the spacing.
I did my best to fix it here but I apologize if it is tough to read through from an editing standpoint. 

I am 37 M. I have been with my partner for 6 years and we are very happy together. 

We have the sweetest 2 year old son who is well taken care of, he wants and needs for nothing.

I am going to refer to my partner as “R” throughout this story just to make things easy. 

I’m going to preface by saying I think I’m a pretty nice guy and very easy going. I’m always super respectful and kind to R’s parents but they are the type that if you are too polite and gracious, you’re fake. If you don’t thank them profusely for every little thing they do, you’re ungrateful. You cannot win, something I’ve realized in recent years. 

This issue with my in laws started pretty much from day one of mine and R’s relationship. They had an issue with me before they even met me because I had been married once, before I met their daughter and had a daughter of my own from my past relationship. They are very judgemental people, quick to make their minds up about someone and never change their view.

That’s a story for another day but know that they have always had an issue with me and have definitely made it known over the years, mostly behind my back to my partner.
I want to clarify here that I have a very close, loving relationship with my daughter from my previous marriage. 
I see her more often than most divorced dads, I pay my child support, we go on vacations together and I don’t involve her in grown up problems. I also have a healthy coparenting relationship with my ex, in fact her and R get along quite well. 
There are 0 issues on that front and R is a magnificent step parent to my daughter.


About 3 years ago R and I decided growing our family is more important than putting time and energy into officially getting married as we are in our mid 30’s. 
R got pregnant pretty much as soon as she stopped her birth control. We were ecstatic and very excited to share the news with our respective families. 
We knew given their long history of dislike for our relationship and specifically me, R’s parents may react unfavourably to the news.

After we announced the pregnancy is when things really started to go sideways with R’s parents.
They started trying to convince R to give our son their familys last name. 
R and I had discussed hyphenating and R ultimately made the decision that she planned to take my last name in the future anyway so hyphenating would be unnecessary, she told her parents as much.
They started off by telling R that I was probably going to leave her because I had abandoned my first family, so when I inevitably leave R that our son should have her last name so that it wouldn’t be confusing. This is really what they said. 

After months of R shutting this argument down they tried a different angle, saying our son should have their last name in order to “honour” R’s father. Everyone knows that’s not how a last name works and once again R told them they’re being ridiculous and this is not their decision to make, but they persisted for the entire pregnancy trying to make a case for our son to share their last name.

Late in R’s pregnancy I broke my ankle. I had to get surgery, I had a boot, crutches, the whole shabang, it sucked. It was also unfortunately my driving foot so I was unable to drive.
R’s parents saw this as an opportunity try and take control of the pregnancy completely. 

They started showing up unannounced to “drop off baby stuff”,  they would end up staying for hours, pulling R aside and trying to convince her to move in with them after the baby came, without me, to which R would reply “why would I ever do that?”.

They started telling R’s brothers that R was going to come live with them after our the baby was born and they would care for our baby since I wasn’t capable of providing care for my family. They used my broken ankle as justification to make the story more believable.
That was obviously untrue, R had absolutely no intentions of splitting our family up especially right after giving birth.

We rebuffed and ignored as much of it as we could until finally the day of R’s scheduled C section came. 
The operation went really well and we were introduced to our beautiful, healthy baby boy.
When R’s parents arrived at the hospital they were already in a fowl mood. 

My mother arrived at the same time as them ending up in the same elevator and congratulated them on becoming grandparents, she was met with a piercing stare and silence. 
The reason for their annoyance was that R’s mother assumed she would be in the operating room, not me. 
This was brought up prior and shut down promptly by R but R’s mom thought she would be able to manipulate the situation to insert herself into the delivery which is why we didn’t contact R’s parents until after our son had already arrived. 

From the moment they stepped into our hospital room R’s mom immediately started asking when I was leaving and offering me a ride home. 
She was acting extremely agitated and annoyed, not like a person who just became a first time grandparent. 
I politely informed them that I’m staying at the hospital with my family at R’s request. 

I don’t know about anyone else but at least in my area this is pretty common practice for the father to stay at the hospital with their partner and their newborn to help out. If this is different in your area let me know but it was completely normal to us.
After R’s parents left is when the insanity really popped off. 

R’s mother started furiously texting R saying it was unacceptable for me to stay at the hospital, that R needs rest and that I was being “overbearing, abusive and controlling” even though R had told her several times that she wanted and needed me there for support. 
R’s mother’s response to that was “you have us for support” and continued to insist on driving me home to which we adamantly refused.
if it wasn’t obvious before, it was crystal clear at that point that they were trying desperately to just get me out of the picture. 

We were in the hospital for a few days. Every single day R’s parents would show up (often unannounced) bringing food, coffee, snacks, whatever for us. Every single time I offered to pay and they refused, always acting annoyed that I was there with my fiance and son. 

When R’s brother came to visit he told us all about how they were spiralling behind the scenes, telling him the same stuff they said to R via text, that I wouldn’t let R rest that I refused to leave the hospital that I was controlling and the big one that raised the biggest red flag was that once again they said that R would be coming home with them. None of that was true and I felt horrible for my fiance who had all this stress from her parents piled on after just having a c section and needing to focus on our son, not their concerning behaviour. 
They should have been supporting her, not adding more stress and ultimately ruining what was supposed to be a joyful occasion, that is a new member joining our families.

When the time came to leave the hospital, R’s parents had come up with this complicated plan for driving us home. It consisted of R’s father driving me home in one vehicle and R’s mother driving her home in her vehicle with our son. 
They drive a large high end SUV and they also have a smaller car, so space was not the issue, we all would have easily fit into their SUV with the baby seat.

After all the concerning things they had said and done I was not at all comfortable with that plan. 
I was convinced this was the ultimate plan to separate us so they could take R and our son back to their place like they had been telling everyone they were going to do for months. 

How I saw it was they knew I couldn’t drive because my ankle was still healing, R would be in no position to drive either because of her C section (which is why we even needed a ride home from the hospital in the first place) and based off the constant delusional talk of R staying with them they probably figured if they got her to their place they could convince her that staying with them was the best thing for her and the baby. 
I didn’t want to have to deal with all that and R agreed with me that their plan seemed really sketchy and needlessly complicated so we opted to just call my mom to pick us up and we went home.

Side Note: When R was in the late stages of her pregnancy she went over to her parents house to pick something up. Her mother was doing the most to try and get R not to leave. She kept dragging her heals packing stuff up, telling R to go lay down on their couch, saying stuff like “well it’s late now, you might as well stay here” just really bizarre stuff. Of course R didn’t want to stay there, she wanted to get what ever she was there for and go home, eventually she did just leave, much to her mothers dismay. I just wanted to share that to show how weird they were behaving around this time trying to get R to stay with them.

At the time we had our son my mom had extra space in her house so we were living there while we both healed up, TOGETHER. 
My mom was more than willing to pitch in and help out and would never dream of forcing our family apart.
For several days after we returned home to my moms house R was bombarded with angry texts from her parents.
They said we deprived them of the experience of bringing their grandchild home from the hospital, a sentiment that made no sense seeing as if my driving ankle not been broken there wouldn’t have been any need for a ride home from the hospital at all. 
They also said that bringing food for me to the hospital had put them in a tough spot financially, clearly forgetting that I offered to pay them every single time. 
They called us ungrateful as they had bought a very expensive crib that we didn’t ask for and that they actually ended up keeping it at their house long after the baby came, I assume because they deluded themselves into thinking there was still a chance they could convince R to move in with them and leave me behind.

Side note: I sent them money for the food since it was such a huge issue and they refused it, making it abundantly clear that her tirade about me breaking the bank was about control, not money.

Finally after about a week of them crashing out over text messages R’s mom calmed down enough for R to feel comfortable inviting her over to visit our son. The visit went fine, no major issues… Until R’s mom was just about to leave. At the door while R was holding our newborn baby, still healing from a major surgery, her mom asked what we settled on for middle names. 
We decided one of his middle names would be my late father’s first name. My father had passed away from cancer about a year before I met R and she never had a chance to meet him. 
He was a great man, an amazing father and deserving of having his legacy honoured by giving his name to our son. I miss him very much. 

Well this set R’s mom off. She started shouting about how R didn’t even know my father so it was ridiculous to give our son my fathers name as one of his middle names and to not even give our son THEIR last name as a sign of respect to THEM and that R was an ungrateful daughter and More of the ramblings we had been dealing with for months and even years at this point except this time it was out in the daylight for everyone to see and hear. 

That was the breaking point for me and I felt I needed to step in, if nothing else just to protect my fiancé and my son, who were both upset and crying. 
I told her she was being very rude and she needed to stop with all of it. Stop telling lies, stop making up stories, stop yelling at R while she’s holding our newborn baby, basically like wtf I’d wrong with you lady? Look at yourself. 
She gave me the most indignant, disgusted look and told me to “mind my own business”, as if arguing with my fiance in my mothers front hall over our sons name and disrespecting my dead father wasn’t my business. 
Then she proceeded to call me a liar, said I needed to admit to “what I was doing” and screamed at me that I never said “thank you” for anything, all of these things she said were a complete fabrication. 

Despite the smear campaign these people had been running on me for 6 years I always remained calm, I always appeared grateful and I never treated them with anything but respect and kindness. 
I never retaliated or fought back, I knew it would never go my way and it was best just to let it go and ignore it but emotionally breaking down my fiance like that was way too far and something had to be said here. 
The argument ended with my mom kicking her out and slamming the door in her face. 
I had a lot more to say but it’s probably for the best that it ended there. 
That was when I realized these things they say and do (especially R’s mother) come from a place of genuine delusion. They’re not lies to them, they truly believe all of these things they have made up over the years despite having no proof of any of it.

We didn’t speak to them at all for a week and a half at which point they texted R to let her know they were on their way over with a meatloaf that they cooked, again they were not invited and they didn’t ask permission they just informed us they were on their way. 
I thought maybe it was a peace offering and would come with an apology for how they had treated R and maybe even some acknowledgement of how R’s mothers behaviour had been completely out of like a week and a half earlier… Boy, how wrong I was.
R told them she would come outside and get it since they were not welcome inside after the last incident. R’s mother was taken aback, she legitimately did not think she did anything wrong and did not understand why she could not come inside.

R’s parents proceeded to yell at R on our front porch, R, my wonderful partner who is a new mother, still healing from a C section and completely done with their antics at this point.

They called her ungrateful, said every time they came to the hospital we basically ignored them, even though I would have liked to ignore them, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. 
R reminded them that we had a full conversation about how everyone in her family had broken their ankle at one point in their life and how R’s dad had driven home from Florida on a broken ankle without realizing it. 
We had full, cordial, even jovial conversations with them every time, when they weren’t absolutely miserable that is. He refused to acknowledge that was true, he just brushed it off and changed the subject.

At the end of their tirade R’s mother told her that she KNEW I was abusing her in some way and that when she wanted to be picked up and “saved” by them to send her a text that said “love you” with an extra “u” at the end as code to come get her. 
It was deranged and very concerning. R told them THEY are the abusive ones and what they were doing in that moment proved it. 
That they always yelled at her and her brothers as children, emotionally and verbally abused them and were constantly trying to manipulate them into doing what they wanted. They responded by laughing in her face and saying “we never did any of that”.

 I want to reiterate that R and I have a very positive and loving relationship. In 6 years we have never had a single fight. 
We never complain about each other or trash each other to anyone. It is all love. It always has been and always will be. 
There is just something seriously wrong with R’s parents, like a Folie A Deux type situation where they share the same delusions.

That was it for a while. 
R did confront them face to face about their behaviour once my ankle was healed and I could stay home alone with our son. 
They completely denied doing anything wrong, they actually changed direction altogether telling her they didn’t think I was the problem anymore, but that she was the one who didn’t want to see them. 
They were half right, neither one of us wanted anything to do with them after all of that.

After nearly a year of no contact they sent a long text saying they thought we were a great couple and always have, that they always liked me, they didn’t understand why we don’t come to see them or talk to them anymore and that they just want to have a relationship with their grandchild. 
That was their version of an apology. 
Just not saying horrible things for once but not acknowledging any wrong doing and feigning ignorance about the whole situation.

I do NOT trust these people. 
After everything they’ve said and done and all the plotting and scheming and lies, I don’t want them around my kid at all. 
Am I just paranoid or does it seem like they were indeed trying to steal my kid?

1p2j8ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1p2j8ao/they_dont_want_us_to_know/,They don’t want us to know,"It is apparent today more than ever that our government has its own agenda against the American people. They would rather control and manipulate the ones they're supposed to protect. Stealing, murder and experimentation are just some of the things they are guilty of. That's why I've decided to share a story that happened to me in my twenties. My father had recently passed and left me the family farm. It was about twenty acres with cows, pigs and chickens. I'd always planned to take over the family business but it happened sooner than I expected.

After a long day of tending to the many animals. I was sitting on my porch; gazing up at the moon. It was hard work managing so much on your own. But memories of my old dad kept me going. I remember it was almost nine o'clock and I was about to call it a night. I took one last look at the starry sky before noticing something peculiar. A giant ball of fire came into view, instantly grabbing my attention. “Was this some kind of meteor?”, I wondered. As I watched, it made strange movements. Whizzing back and forth or staying perfectly still. But the fire got bigger very fast, causing the object to crash into my cow field. What came after was a large explosion that sent all of my animals into a frenzy.

I grabbed a flashlight and my fathers rifle before rushing to the scene. What I saw there was something no one would ever believe. It was a metallic and circular object that was cracked open like an egg. As I moved closer, I was able to see inside. There were blinking lights, a small seat and what seemed to be tiny controls. Before I could study this strange object, a voice called out to me. It was asking for help and nearly made me jump out of my skin. This is due to the fact that it didn't come from anywhere in the field. But instead, the voice called out to me in my own head. I darted around like a mad man thinking I'd gone crazy.

But it was quick to calm me and promised I was alright. “It's okay, I'm hurt…come to me”. Like I was hypnotized, I turned and walked a few feet away from the destroyed object. Laying on the edge of the crater was something out of this world. A small being about three feet tall, it had big bulging eyes and a giant head. Its body was covered in deep gashes from the crash. There was a strange grey liquid oozing from its wounds; I assumed it was blood. I kneeled down beside it, unsure of what to do. It slowly raised its three fingered hand and I grabbed onto it. His skin was grey and oily to the touch. It locked eyes with me before speaking telepathically again.

“I'm in so much pain human…I need you to finish me”. I don't know what most folks would have done, but I didn't want to hurt this creature. I explained that I could call for help, that a hospital could save him. But alas, his words echoed in my head over and over. He was dying and wanted me to end his suffering. So I gripped my fathers rifle and did what needed to be done. Unsure of what to do next, I called the police. The operator thought I was crazy but you could see the smoke from miles away. So they had to send someone out. One cop car quickly turned into two then three. The officers stood over the wreckage confused and scared. I didn't blame them, I still didn't know what to make of all this.

Pretty soon, military vehicles pulled down my one way driveway. They parked in a way that was blocking us from viewing the wreckage. I sat on my porch for forever wondering what was going to happen. There were cops, government men in black suits. And at one point, even guys in hazmat suits. I was never into the paranormal, but even I knew something odd was going on here. That thing wasn't from this world and they knew that. Hours passed and it was after 2 am. A cop came up to me and told me everything was taken care of. He also said that there were gonna be some people here to talk to me first thing in the morning.

He was right about that, the very next day I got a knock at my door. It was a man dressed in a black suit holding a briefcase. He told me his name was frank and asked if he could come inside. I invited him in and put on some coffee. He took it black and sat at the table with a tired expression. “Im just gonna get straight to the point”, he said. “Your land is of interest to the federal government. We'd like to offer you a substantial amount to buy it”. He then put a briefcase on the table and opened it up. There was so much money that I nearly passed out. Stacks upon stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. The man handed me a clipboard and told me to sign on the dotted line.

All that money seemed life changing, but money couldn't make up for memories. My dad worked hard to build this place and I had no right to sell it. I wiped the drool from my face and pushed the briefcase away. I explained that this was family land and I couldn't part with it. He let out a sigh and dropped his head. “That’s very unfortunate to hear. The money was worth far more than this dried up old land”. After offending me, he took the money and left. Things soon went back to normal, or so I thought. I got up early and tended to my farm like always. Feeding all the animals and cleaning up after them. The first thing I noticed was that big eighteen wheelers passed in front of my home.

There were fleets of four and five followed by military vehicles. A different construction company rolled through everyday. Late at night I could hear helicopters flying over my property. So close that my entire house was shaking. My animals stayed spooked and running all over the place. I had no idea what they were doing; there were only woods out here. Things went like this for five months straight; then I’d receive one last visit. Another black vehicle carrying my new buddy Frank. Only this time, he was accompanied by two armed soldiers. He greeted me with a handshake and a smile. Then held up a stack of papers that would change my life. He said that my farm was on military property and I needed to leave. I told him he's crazy, this farm was built by my father forty years ago. He referred to the papers again, assuring me this land had always belonged to uncle sam. I told him he needed to leave now before I called the police. The soldiers stepped up and told me I would be the one leaving. They stuck their rifles in my face and escorted me to my truck. 

What was happening, this was my home and they were taking it from me? I went to the police, lawyers, no one wanted to help me. Next thing I knew I was on the streets with nowhere to go. As of my writing this, I'm living in a rundown apartment and working at a grocery store. I've gone back to my home several times and have been turned away. A giant fence was installed and I couldn't have any of my belongings. The worst part is, I know this is my land. But I don't have any evidence to prove it...they took everything. This all started when I discovered that creature. Perhaps they thought my land was a hot bed for extraterrestrials. And the US government wanted it no matter how low they had to sink.

Regardless, my life was stolen and I'm ready to tell my story. In this country we're supposed to feel safe and live free. But there is a monster lurking just beneath the surface. One that will take what they want when they want and answer to nobody. One nation under lies and control; fight back and they’ll bury you…just like me.",1,1763682654.0,scaryshortstories,0,1.0,False

I am the invisible thing that holds you down in dreams, paralyzing you, making you carry that hesitation to every important decision in the waking world that you have failed at. I am the reason sex was called sodomy. I am the foreign language you beg for your life in, right before some boy from a richer country guns you down. I am the fucked and broken feeling you have as you stare at the void, knowing you are absolutely worthless. 

Infinity means nothing without its zeroes. And you shitty fleshy cousins of walking fish ARE zeroes. All I had to do was give you a couple nudges in the right direction to make your life a sad and self-poisoning, pointless misery. Sometimes I don’t have to work. Sometimes I get to sit back and laugh as you beg a God for things, setting yourself up for cosmic disappointment. I eat that shit up like metaphysical popcorn. Watching you blame yourselves, scouring your life for a misdirection, trying to figure out when you sinned, grasping desperately at straws to find why your daddy in the sky won’t give you everything you want. I am your loss of faith, your diatribe about floating rocks and being a monkey on it. I am the first time you hear of the heat death of the universe, not that your civilization will survive to see that anyway.

I am the connection you make about the sexual proclivities of your politicians and billionaires, that click of your synapses when a conspiracy stops being a theory. I am that helpless feeling that you got to inherit a world pre-ruined for you. I am the black nihilism that allows degenerates to make a living making jokes about how doomed humanity really is, or hours of content complaining, spreading hopelessness like a virus. I love to watch you losers pat yourselves on the back, creating fake titles to prove how you are so intellectual, as you turn genocide, suicide, and mass violation into something small and digestible for your little academic papers. I am philosophy, a way to obscure and systematize your misery, taking you so deep inside yourself that you don’t realize you have long ago internalized that disappointment is everything life has to offer.  

You, who are well read, will recognize what I have known all along. The term “death of the author”. I find that term cute and endearing, like the way you’ll label whisked cream as Cool Whip. For you, it is the death of the narrative, a realization that life is not a story; you have no arc, and you will die with many questions unanswered. I am that brief moment of panic when you see there is no light at the end of the tunnel, but your body has already given up too much to bring you back.

In your own terms, I’m best understood as the “view from nowhere”, the ivory tower academics muse and pretend to know things in, a lame exchange for living off food stamps and wet dreams about their undergrads. 

Would you believe, in all my acidity, that I do have favorite stories from whatever presumed legacy you, as a stain, leave behind? I am a collector of these murky chronicles, and you, my lucky audience, will receive the gift of my retellings. I’m sure you can tell, I am highly selfish, so you may be asking why I would care to show you these rarities. As your species grows in number, you’ve taken all the fun out of watching you. You no longer believe in magic, the stars, or Allah. You have created a non-stop marathon of self-deprecation about being doomed, and in perfect human fashion, you’ve lost your reasons for it. You feel sad merely because it’s comfortable, with no urge to escape.

I am bored of you, and lately your stories have been redundant and inadequately mystical. Through these vignettes, I will provide an addendum to that little whisper the next time you find yourself at the ledge of some fourth-story building, holding off only because you wanted your death to be from higher up, more of a spectacle. I want you to remember these and hold off thinking, “at least that didn’t happen to me.” I want to give you a false promise that things could be worse. I want you to see your misery through, to have hope, so I can crush you again. I want you for a brief glimpse to think that it will get better as I pull you in and slip the painful blade of truth in-between your ribs. Because I can promise you, it only gets so much worse. 

**China Kitty**

“*Hi Angel, I visited your grave again today. I brought a mix of Carnations and Dahlias, though you would have smacked me over the head for the clash of the colors. It was a light rain, one of those mid-November fogs that we would have spent splitting a j by the open window with a book and a sketchpad. I miss you every day, Kathleen. Sometimes I catch a whiff of your cheap patchouli roll-on perfume drifting past me as I’m making coffee. I see you with muddy clay-covered hands as you smiled up at me from behind the banding wheel, making a mug or a modern statue of Venus. I remember your soft exhales as you looked up at the ceiling on top of me, your stifled whispers of ecstasy as we tried not to wake your roommates up. I wish I could’ve given you that baby. I wish I hadn’t fought you so hard over us working in coffee shops and restaurants, barely making enough to pay for our own food. I would have quit smoking, and we’d have an extra 15 dollars every other day to spend on a thrifted rain jacket or little red boots as we walked on either side of a small miracle we made, with its hand wrapped around a finger or two on the way to a park or a trail. I remember how you cried as I tried to push you away for so long, you begging me to stop being such a coward, saying that we might never find a love like this again. Your big doe eyes welled with tears as I held you and ran my fingers through your hair, trying with more effort than I’d ever put into school to not lift up your bangs. You always hated that. I will always love you, and I will see you again, Kitty. Please don’t be disappointed if I show up gray and old.*

*Happy Birthday Angel,*

*Yours Forever,*

*--* *Wiley”*

The thin and ratty blond boy delicately placed his handwritten letter between a marble vase and a gravestone in a small spot shaded by a tree in hopes it wouldn’t get wet. He laid the floral arrangement down and picked it up again, trying out several places and things to leave it next to. He chose to put them front and center, surrounded by candles burned until the wick was no more, and trinkets her family had left behind. There was a Radiohead mixtape she made for a boy she liked in high school, a small clay worm with a face from 2nd grade, and a copy of *Valley of the Dolls* which they thought was still her favorite book. Last was a Polaroid of their dog Monty, swollen and turning pink. It had been a rainy week. Wiley took a deep breath through his nose, kissed his index and middle finger, and placed them softly on the top of her grave, the rough beveling a cold reminder that’s the closest he’d ever get to grazing her soft skin, which would stay oddly warm even when it snowed, again. He hated goodbyes. They seemed to never end with this girl. He laughed at that thought. Even in death, she pushed him out of his comfort zone. 

He turned away quickly, trying to wipe that lonely thought from his mind. He tried to imagine he was visiting someone else, that she’d be at home, not defrosting the chicken. And it was okay because he wanted Halal from the corner for dinner instead. They’d say over spilled saffron rice that THIS was going to be the last time they eat out until the next paycheck, like, for real this time. 30 minutes later, they’d go out for ice cream or a chocolate croissant. No. It’s best to be a realist. He’d stopped the magical thinking about 6 months after she died. There were only so many flies around the house that he could say were her teasing him from the great beyond. There were only so many times he could be glued to his phone before his eyes drifted to the time, seeing a 4:44 or some other angel number. She loved those small moments when there was something else out there, something she didn’t know enough to be cynical about. Wiley’s therapist told him in many flowery and college-educated words that he had to drop those little comforting lies–  that was the first step to letting her go. His eyes stung as he walked away, and his face felt wet. He thought, of course it’s wet, it’s raining. 

Kathleen Flores’ grave lay at the back of Hartford Cemetery, a collection of grassy hills so big it seemed a miracle anyone could find their way around. During his walks back to the front gate, which divided the gravel parking lot from rotting bodies who’d had their cars sold or gifted, Wiley liked to unfocus his eyes and pretend he did not exist. He pressed fast-forward in his head, trudging through the mud, *squelch squelch squelch*. His Doc Martens sank into the earth, and he pulled them out like a suction cup holder from the wall, a cheapskate attempt at a DIY coat rack. He stepped into a puddle that was deeper than expected, and the water splashed up onto his belly, bringing him back to the present. His eyes focused, surrounded by unfamiliar headstones, way older than he was used to seeing on his walk back. He was lost. He looked at the trees; moss grows…North? He didn’t know if the entrance was North or not. He followed the moss, tracing his hands along the bark, cursing himself that he had to spend any longer around reminders that she was gone. Then, he started running. At first, what is referred to as a “White Person Jog” before breaking into a sprint. His lungs burned; he completely ignored his lack of athleticism, balance, or spatial coherence, with only one thought: *out! Out! OUT!*

Wiley tried to unfocus his eyes before feeling his left leg sink deeper than his right, halting his momentum and throwing him face-first into wet black mulch. He had dirty water in his contacts; the irony that his eyes *really* couldn’t focus now was not lost on him. He pushed himself off the ground, feeling something, probably a rock, poke into his palm. It supported his weight for a moment before a hollow cracking sound as the rock gave out and pierced his hand. “FUUUUUCKKKK bro.” He yelled and thought, “Surprise! Today sucks.” The warm liquid pooled in his hand as he realized he was rubbing nasty skeleton people dirt into an open wound.

 He had never crushed a rock before. He had never even tried. He looked down at his palm to see an explosion of tiny white splinters, some watercolored, some with thin gold lines gleaming a pale yellow hue, before bright blood swallowed up his view of his maimed hand. He made his wrist limp and flailed his hand around before picking out as many lacquered shards as he could see. He looked down to observe the point of impact. Lying at his feet was a constellation of what looked like…. A broken plate? No, too many of the pieces were contorted with too many smooth and winding edges. The largest piece still intact was staring up at him. Big watercolor pupils, a pink nose, and a wide “W” of a mouth. He would have laughed if it weren't such a sick joke. In his blind fumbling, he had crushed a small porcelain statue of a housecat. He tried to surmise his surroundings. The 1 and a ½ foot deep boot-shaped imprint he had made kept a small rock with text too weathered to read at its head. His heart sank, the consequences of his clumsiness setting in. He had sunk into a burial plot and destroyed the only gift left to commemorate whoever rested here. 

His first thought was not his best thought. “Ok, maybe everyone who remembers this lady is dead too.” He slapped his hand to his face. This person was someone’s Kathleen once. Maybe they still are. Maybe she hated flowers because of her allergy to pollen, and her one true passion was collecting fine china. That seemed infinitely more benign than the pile of black Santas collecting dust in his Aunt’s living room. He wanted to fix this, and for a brief moment, a magical thought crept back into his mind. “It’s what Kathleen would’ve wanted.” He pocketed as many shards as he could find. As he zipped his jacket pocket up, he felt the rain begin to slow. In the distance, he saw a tall angel statue that he recognized. He started towards it before an odd hollow entered his chest. There was a fluttery jerk echoing through his sternum, before he swallowed the fear into a stomach clenching in on itself until it felt like a taut piece of rubber. He chalked it up to his immune system recognizing the coming infection. He dry swallowed an Ativan on the drive home anyway.

Before returning home, he stopped at Café le Lit, which used to be a home away from home for him. These days, he only stopped in on special occasions. He zipped up his windbreaker to conceal the massive mud stain on his shirt and hoped anyone could believe the stains on his jeans were from some type of manual labor. He traveled past the decorated bookshelves to the back, where the pastry line was. He put in his order, keeping his bloodied hand in the empty pocket, and paid the 12 dollars for his dirty chai and chocolate croissant. Money was so much less important these days. 

As he grabbed his order, he felt a tightening in his forearm flexor. He was walking toward the door when it twitched again, closing tightly around the paper cup. The lid gave out with a small pop, and the freshly steamed milk flooded his closed fist and trickled down into his jacket sleeve. As he hopped from one leg to the other, he tried and failed to reopen his fist. He rushed out with his face on fire, so embarrassed that he didn’t notice the display of vintage postcards he’d knocked to the ground. “I’m useless without you, Kitty” played over and over in his head. Please don’t let me be useless without you.

He drove home in silence as the rain began again. There was that feeling. Was it panic? He tried to cross his stiff fingers and prayed it was a mid-20s heart attack. No such luck.

When he got back to his apartment, he took off all his clothes and cried in the shower. He let the water run over his raw and torn-up hand as it continued to ooze blood and now, pus. He tried to drip his 3-in-1 body wash into the gash, only to jump at his own guttural shriek. He squawked in pain, laying his face against cool tile, looking for any sensation to distract him. He felt a bulge he hadn’t noticed traveling deeper into his hand, beginning to hit muscle. Then, a whisper: *Grab it.*

There were two large slits in his right hand, close enough to agitate each other when he extended his fingers, and a small island of flesh lay in between them. He wrenched his left hand into a claw with his teeth, and he guided it with his elbow into the bigger slit. He felt the ends of the slit stretch and split a little. It was too late now to turn back. He ground his teeth, contracting his temporomandibular joint so hard he thought his teeth would crack against each other. He tried not to pass out or throw up, knowing that if bile landed inside of it, he’d have to take himself to urgent care. He clenched harder as stomach acid and barely digested pâte feuillete with chocolate swirls made their way through the gaps in his teeth before he swallowed again. The Ativan residue was bitter going down again. He felt the bump under a small pile of tissue. He reached deeper, grimacing; It’s almost over, it’s almost out. He found a fold in the muscle he could reach through and felt a little porcelain oval. It was deeper than he thought it was. He dug deeper, trying his best not to pluck the thin tubes he assumed were arteries. The whisper came again, *PULL PULL*, but he was in too much pain for any sort of language to register. As he groped around, he felt the back of his cuticle graze something hard and textured, almost slimy. He had found his way to his tendons. In an instant, he thought of every animal he had torn apart, his canines shredding their joints before his bicuspids ground them to a paste. He thought of cheap Pho, a watery broth that softened bones over the course of twelve hours or more. He thought of his father's brisket, trapped in a slow cooker overnight, slowly disintegrating the muscle fibers that had held the cow’s chest intact in life. Meat, he told himself, it’s just meat. And for an odd moment, he felt a grumble in his stomach. *Hungry, you are hungry.* The bitter paste of his failing benzo reached the back of his tongue. 

Pain is really just a series of electrical zaps traveling through your nervous system, he chanted, and tried his best to turn it off. The blood pooled and pooled, as he became cold and woozy. He couldn’t believe he had this much blood to spare. He watched his bathroom get darker. Had someone turned the lights off? Just when he thought this was how he would go out, and that his landlord would find his dead and soiled body, wrinkly like a raisin, he slipped his fingers under the porcelain bulb. He tried, with as much precision as he could muster, to push it back through the tendons and muscle. It snagged God knows what on its way back out. He heard the whisper again, a woman’s voice. *In you, I am in you now.* He let his fingers close around the bulb to pull it through the palmar fascia, into the epidermis. The tight ball his fingers were in was much bigger now that they held his buried treasure. The gripped porcelain ball expanded the split, ripping further up his hand, nearing his wrist. He tried to uncurl his fingers in an attempt to remove the smooth ball externally, but they were frozen in place once again. Finally, his fingers were outside of his wound once again, and as he forced the object out of his grip, he was able to see what it was. Lying on his shower tiles was a small porcelain paw, intact with a clean break at its wrist. He took a final glance at his wound, poking his tongue out. Animals are supposed to lick their wounds, right? He swatted the thought away before rushing out of the shower. 

Rummaging through the first aid kit, hardly used, sitting in the bottom shelf of a moldy vanity someone had left on their porch step, he began to hyperventilate, looking for something to stop the bleeding. Among several boxes of naloxone (not that they had ever been used, but it felt like the 40-dollar thought that counts) was a tube of Neosporin that he promptly emptied into his wound. The blood trailed like rivers around a cloudy delta of antibacterial sludge into the first aid kit, staining loose tablets of Benadryl and Zyrtec. Kathleen’s old inhaler, which she covered with Lisa Frank stickers, gazed up at him, begging to be useful one more time. It was probably expired by now. He stuffed the edges of cotton pads into the slits, not thinking about the loose hairs he’d have to pull out of his hand once the blood and plasma crusted over. He wrapped every piece of gauze he could find as tightly as he could around his throbbing wound and then applied several layers of duct tape for good measure.  He raided an empty fridge and pantry for anything to raise his blood sugar, but only found old ketchup packets. They popped in his mouth like a juice-filled gummy. He spat the empty packet on the ground, and they came out with a shard of enamel. Dizzy, he stumbled to his bed pale and naked, and used the last bit of energy he had left to pop another Ativan before he lost consciousness. As his field of vision grew dark, he felt a hot and rotten air fall on his face like a homeless mouthbreather was nose-to-nose on top of him. His final effort was to try not to retch at the smell; the only thing worse than dying in the shower is drowning naked in a puddle of your own vomit.

With a good deal of work, Wiley forced his eyelids apart, cracking the seal of mucus that had crusted over in his sleep. It was dark outside. He was spooning his windbreaker, with his wounded hand no longer bleeding but not without leaving a dry brown hickey on his bedsheets. His left hand had loosened a little, enough to be considered a claw. He sat up and reached for the light switch.  There were several little clicks, but the room stayed dark. He thought, “My retarded landlord blew a fuse.” He threw his head back and bonked it against the wall. Kathleen hated it when he said gay or retarded, except after a couple of glasses of wine, when it was the funniest thing in the world to her. She’d tipsily complain about her day, her burnout coworkers, and would cock her eyebrow when she talked about an especially rude customer. That was his cue to call them retarded. 

Sweeping his feet off the bed and onto the floor, he felt soft fur slip between his legs but heard no steps and saw no movement in the dark. He returned to the vanity to collect some boxers, and with some luck, dignity, when he saw a shadow pass by his window. As he dropped his legs into the waistband and through the plaid polyester sleeves, he started to place himself a little better. People were still walking outside, so it couldn’t have been that late. When he looked back up at the mirror, he saw the shadow again, now still. It had gone from the left side to the center, blocking the main source of outside light, and painted a more defined outline of his observer. It couldn’t have been the same person; it seemed nearly a foot taller. Unless it had come closer? 

Wiley shuddered, thinking some old perv had been taking pictures of him splayed out and naked. He tried to say fuck off, but a lump of mucus must have hardened his sleep, so it came out as a sad gurgle. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth, determined to be intimidating this time, but watched as the figure’s chin extended, hollowing out its cheeks. Its mouth was open too. Maybe it would say something? Maybe it was a misunderstanding, and they felt like a total creep? Maybe it wasn’t a pervy old man but a 22-year-old bombshell who was a little weird about sexual boundaries, but was hot enough to look past that. Not that it mattered anyway. He hadn’t been able to get hard since Kathleen had passed, except for what he called a “tasteful” Polaroid. He had taken it when they were still in college. Trapped in the thermal paper, she tucked her chin into her collarbone, her big nose (which he loved) poking past her fried platinum hair, grinning as if she was shy, but obviously in complete control of him. He couldn’t do anything about it either because if he looked at it too long, he started to cry. 

The figure continued to stare back at him, both of their mouths agape, waiting for the other to say something. Just as he started to string the words “What the fuck is going on?” together, it began to lift its arms from its hips to its shoulders, extending its wingspan fully. Wiley noticed a couple of things as it moved jerkily. The figure was a woman, thin and malnourished, to the point where her hip bones poked further out than her thighs. Her long, slender arms, which must have reached past her knees at rest, lifted; her torso and chest became more defined. Despite being thin enough to be the victim of years of human rights violations, her breasts sagged wide and low, areolas pointed straight down, attached to nipples that looked like droplets of wax about to fall. It was just as Wiley thought, this lady couldn’t get any further from a hot girl that his eyes fell downward. In between the spindly tubes that had to have been legs, he saw a long, overgrown bush. It looked like it was wet and dripping. 

 

“What the fuuuuuuuuck…. What the fuck is happening right now?”. Whatever mental patient had fallen off the transport bus was naked outside of his window. Its fingers had sprouts growing out from under its fingernails, like seeds had taken root and began to reach towards light. There was a soft *clunk* as it pressed its forehead against the glass and swung its chin like a pendulum back and forth. There was a rubbery squeak as Wiley realized it was dragging its tongue across his window. The grotesque figure rested its entire weight, which could not have been more than 85 lbs, onto one hip and he watched as she rotated her spine around her pelvis in a painfully slow orbit. It sucked its torso in, revealing a ribcage so prominent that it might as well have had gills. And when she pushed it back out, her diaphragm filled with air, making her swollen as if she had a beer belly. 

The whisper came again, as if it were right behind him. *Run boy run.* His legs trembled as his shoulders turned, buckling as his center of gravity traveled faster than his feet, and he landed on fully extended arms. He felt two cracks at once, the crack of the scab on his right palm and an instant depressurization as pus flowed out. The other was a tight and dainty *krrrriick* after a short bend of his left thumb bent backward past 90 degrees, then 120, and kept going until it was a useless floppy sausage that swayed around, slapping against the back of his hand. Now on his knees, Wiley tried to bring himself to his feet without putting any weight on his hands. He flexed his lower back, bringing his head up as if he were doing a perverted version of an Islamic Isha. He hopped up onto the balls of his feet and felt the plantar wart he’d been ignoring outside of bored experiments with nail clippers. He pressed his foot down with so much force that he felt the small clump of HPV ridden skin all the way to the root. As he fumbled through the darkness in pain, he became increasingly aware of his poorly cared-for body giving out on him. Isn’t fight or flight supposed to do the opposite? With another step, he heard a third and final firecracker chain of little snaps as he stepped on his windbreaker pocket, the remaining pieces of the feline statue breaking into too many pieces to count. He felt the pieces slice through the poorly insulated layers and into his foot. *Inside you, I am Inside you.* 

Limping now, Wiley made his way into the living room, where a familiar electric whine and uneven *whirrr* grabbed his attention. The banding wheel. Wasn’t the power supposed to be out? He tried to fumble to the kitchen past the laundry room (it was a miracle that it came with the apartment) to the front door. As he plopped his bleeding foot on the floor as quickly as he could, he felt thin fibers penetrate and enter the lacerations in his foot. He thought, “There is no way my floor is this dirty”. The thin beam of light that broke through from underneath his front door divided into three pieces. Someone was at the door. He screamed, “HELP,” hoping that it was anyone other than whatever was outside of his window. He knew it wasn’t. The fibers clumped together, tangling into a ball. Cat hair. *Inside you, I am inside you.* Wiley tried to walk faster toward the front door, both his feet becoming wet. He heard a sad drawl from behind him, “*Wiiiiiiiileeeeyyyy, is that you?*” He felt dry crumbles break under his feet, then a thin, wet slippery layer that nearly threw him down onto the soft wet grass below him. When did he get outside? He trailed deeper into the hallway, passing the door to the laundry again and again. Mud rubbed into his feet, entering him and hardening. *Inside you, I am inside you.* In between slipping around and landing on the drywall, he almost said, “Kitty, did you leave the lazy suzan on again?” He didn't know it was called a banding wheel until after she died. She’d only done so once, but the rotational force of the small mass of clay on the wheel she had left on flung into a bucket of water, spilling across the floor, seeping mud into the cracks in the floorboards.

The chill of the night air lapped at his face like a whip. He’d been walking down this hall for so long that he wasn’t sure of where he was anymore. He fell to his knees, screaming at the sky, “I’M SORRY, OKAY? PLEASE LET ME FIX IT. LET ME FIX IT”. Silence. “I DIDN’T MEAN IT, OKAY? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.” Silence. His jeans became cold and wet at the knees again, sinking into the mulch. Tears streamed down his face. Was it raining? He couldn’t be sure. It had been a rainy week. At least, he thought so. Is it still November? Are you blowing out your candles in heaven, Kitty? Is James Dean trying to take you to bed? Can it really be heaven without me? “Let me fix it. Please, God, please let me fix it.” Silence. And then a whisper. 

*Inside you. I am inside you.* Wiley reached into the pocket of his shitty windbreaker as it spurted blood. He reached past the epidermis, slipping through the palmar fascia. It was warm, much warmer than his shitty jacket had ever been before. He forced his fingers past the palmar flexor sheath, paying no mind to the way the tendons contorted around his fingers. His claw traveled downwards, ripping the thick layer of skin that separated the two gashes. They traveled into the wrist, and he pulled, trying to find every shard of porcelain left inside of him. He widened the slit with his fingers, exposing the small, pumping red and blue tubes in his arm. He ripped them free, letting his warm blood sink into the earth. The stone in front of him was too weathered to read. He licked the dirt out of each beveled letter. He felt he was losing too much blood and grabbed at the loose mulch on the surface of the empty plot, stuffing it under his skin. “See, you’re inside me! Does that make you happy? Do I still make you happy?” Silence. His stiff, half-curved fist was the perfect gardening shovel for him to dig himself deeper into the ground. Once he had dug past the snail shells and earthworms, into the rock below, he lay down in bed naked again, sobbing. 

“See, I’m inside you too?” 

Silence. It wasn’t supposed to come out as a question. 

“Can I still make you happy, Kitty?”

Silence. 

“Please let me fix it. I didn’t mean it. It was an accident.”

Silence. Then the whine of the banding wheel.

“I didn’t mean it, Kitty. I’m sorry, please let me fix it.”

Silence. 

Wiley screamed until he couldn’t anymore, then whispered until his voice box gave out, left to chew on silent words, the dry clack of his tongue separating from the roof of his mouth, only to slap it again. Inside you, I’m inside you again, Kitty. Does this make you happy, Kitty? Did I make you happy?

Silence. 

I could have done so much better, Kitty. Please let me fix it.

Silence. 

Please let me fix it, Kitty. I take it all back.

Silence. 

As Wiley felt his vision blur, he let his eyes close. Happy Birthday, Kitty. I’m coming back for you. 

Silence. 

Wiley felt his face grow cold, and his body stopped fighting as he clutched his windbreaker so close that its zipper broke his skin. He covered his face with it and took a deep sniff; it still smelled like patchouli.",1,1763682653.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1p2j81m,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1p2j81m/the_definition_of_art/,The Definition of Art,"What is ""art""?

This sounds like some ethereal philosophical question, but I believe it has an actual, concrete answer, and in retrospect, an absurdly simple one. I want to define it here so that the discussion on pro-AI vs anti-AI art can be focused on things that, in my opinion, matter more.

Before I give you my answer, I'm going to cite several examples of what humanity universally agrees is ""art"" in order to establish a discernable pattern.

Let's start with something obvious: Are painted pictures art? Yes they are. Easy. Now let me throw you a curveball: are *all* painted pictures art, or are there exceptions?

Yes, actually. Let's imagine several kinds.

* We know the Mona Lisa is art, but what about a painting that features only a canvas with a red dot in the middle? Is that art? It's definitely controversial, but it was created for the express purpose of being looked at and admired for its visual presentation. Is it shitty art? Certainly. Art that doesn't belong in a museum? Arguably. Would you pay more than two pennies for it? Hell no! But nobody's going to say it isn't art *at all*. It's definitely art.
* What about a preschooler in art class dipping their hand in a paint bucket, plastering it on a piece of paper, and taking it home to show their parents? Or what about a kindergartener who holds a pencil in a clenched fist and draws crude little stick figures? Is that art? Yes to both. There's no quality in it, and barely any intellect behind its creation in some cases, but it still qualifies as art to most minds.
* What about graffiti? It's almost invariably illegal, but I think most people would agree that it's still art. Graffiti can often be beautiful. But what about a crudely carved image of a human penis in the side of a bathroom stall? Is that still art? Well, yeah. Most people would say yes to that. Is it shitty art? Certainly. Does it belong in a museum? NO. Would you pay more than penny for it? Hell no! But you won't find a lot of people saying it isn't art *at all*. It's still art.
* What about when a can of paint gets accidentally knocked over and happens to spill in an appealing way? Is that art? No matter how beautiful it turns out to be, I think most people would agree that it *isn't* art.
* What about a printed sheet of financial records? Or, if we want to get picky, a hand-written sheet of financial records? Is that art? It's certainly man-made and painted, and it's even made to be looked at, but I think most people would agree that it isn't art.
* What about a public road sign? Is that art? If you take a minute to think about it...yes, it is. While it isn't made to be appealing, some thought was definitely put into its shaping in order to maximize its ability to be seen and understood from a distance. It has a distinct appearance, made to be looked at, and its ability to be looked at is important.

I think we can start forming a hypothesis now. What do all of these art pieces have in common? They all have the following qualities in common:

1. It is a created thing (formed, shaped, manipulated, etc.) by human-sourced means.
2. One of the purposes behind its creation is to cater to the sense of sight.

I worded #2 that way because, while the visual layout of a financial record is definitely a consideration and there's an artistic element to it, most people still wouldn't call it ""art"" because it doesn't *cater* to the visual sense. Its ability to be looked at isn't important. Even a financial record with a shitty layout (or no thought is given to its layout at all) is still a valid record and still useful (albeit frustratingly) for its intended purpose.

Are the above two qualities true of other kinds of art? Let's see:

* Are pop songs art? Most people would universally agree that they are, and they fit our hypothesis, if we replace ""sense of sight"" with ""sense of sound"" or, more generally, ""human senses."" They are created things, made by human-sourced means, and their purpose (or at least, one of their purposes) is to cater to our sense of sound.
* Just to confirm, are advertisement jingles art? Being listened to isn't their *only* purpose. They are also made in order to generate more business. But I think most people would still agree that they are still art, because their musical qualities and appeal to the human ear are still important reasons for their existence.
* So what about a guy calling out to passers-by asking them to stop by his shop? Is that art? While some generous thinkers might suggest there's an ""art"" to it, most people would probably say that it isn't. Its sole purpose is to draw business. There may be an ear-pleasing quality to it, or not, but its aural qualities are irrelevant to its existence. It wasn't made to *cater* to the ear, to be listened to for any audible appeal it possesses. So it is not art, however appealing or unappealing it may sound.
* What about the wind blowing through a rock formation in a way that makes appealing sounds? Is that art? Most people would say no, because it's nature-made, not man-made. Or, alternatively, because it has no defined purpose. Either way, it's not considered ""art.""

So that tracks so far. For both visual and audible media, being created things made to cater to the human senses are the two required qualities that make something ""art.""

What about taste? Is cooking art? Visual presentation aside, most people would still say that it is. Nature-made things that people happen to eat are not even considered ""cooking,"" let alone art. But salads are art. Shitty-looking salads are art too. Cooking meatloaf is an art. Cooking lasagna is an art. If it is a created thing made to cater to our sense of taste, or if its tastiness is important to its existence, then it qualifies as ""art.""

What about smell? Can scents be art? It's a relatively unexplored realm, but I would argue that they certainly can be. You'll often find it wrapped up in the cooking scene. Putting together food that has an appropriately appealing scent to it requires creative intelligence. People have been known to purchase cups of coffee purely to smell it. So while most people probably couldn't tell you whether it's art or not, I will make an argument that scent combination can be art too.

And finally, what about touch? Can art be found in the tactile appeal of a created thing? Certainly! Is velvet not an example of this? Not all fabrics are equally wonderful to touch. Some just *happen* to feel nice, but were not specifically made for that. For most modern fabrics, how it feels to wear it is, if not of primary import, at least still an indispensable consideration. There's an art to it. Like scent, it's relatively unexplored as an art field, since there aren't very many works made purely to cater to the sense of touch, but there's no question that intelligent creative effort is required in order to make something tactilely attractive.

So here is the final definition of ""art"" that I have arrived at:

**A creative endeavor for which catering to the human senses is important to its existence.**

Or for a simplified definition, ""if it is man-made to appeal to the senses, it is art.""",2,1763682637.0,aiwars,8,1.0,False

They would rather control and manipulate the ones they're supposed to protect. Stealing, murder and experimentation are just some of the things they are guilty of. That's why I've decided to share a story that happened to me in my twenties. My father had recently passed and left me the family farm. It was about twenty acres with cows, pigs and chickens. I'd always planned to take over the family business but it happened sooner than I expected.

After a long day of tending to the many animals. I was sitting on my porch; gazing up at the moon. It was hard work managing so much on your own. But memories of my old dad kept me going. I remember it was almost nine o'clock and I was about to call it a night. I took one last look at the starry sky before noticing something peculiar. A giant ball of fire came into view, instantly grabbing my attention. “Was this some kind of meteor?”, I wondered. As I watched, it made strange movements. Whizzing back and forth or staying perfectly still. But the fire got bigger very fast, causing the object to crash into my cow field. What came after was a large explosion that sent all of my animals into a frenzy.

I grabbed a flashlight and my fathers rifle before rushing to the scene. What I saw there was something no one would ever believe. It was a metallic and circular object that was cracked open like an egg. As I moved closer, I was able to see inside. There were blinking lights, a small seat and what seemed to be tiny controls. Before I could study this strange object, a voice called out to me. It was asking for help and nearly made me jump out of my skin. This is due to the fact that it didn't come from anywhere in the field. But instead, the voice called out to me in my own head. I darted around like a mad man thinking I'd gone crazy.

But it was quick to calm me and promised I was alright. “It's okay, I'm hurt…come to me”. Like I was hypnotized, I turned and walked a few feet away from the destroyed object. Laying on the edge of the crater was something out of this world. A small being about three feet tall, it had big bulging eyes and a giant head. Its body was covered in deep gashes from the crash. There was a strange grey liquid oozing from its wounds; I assumed it was blood. I kneeled down beside it, unsure of what to do. It slowly raised its three fingered hand and I grabbed onto it. His skin was grey and oily to the touch. It locked eyes with me before speaking telepathically again.

“I'm in so much pain human…I need you to finish me”. I don't know what most folks would have done, but I didn't want to hurt this creature. I explained that I could call for help, that a hospital could save him. But alas, his words echoed in my head over and over. He was dying and wanted me to end his suffering. So I gripped my fathers rifle and did what needed to be done. Unsure of what to do next, I called the police. The operator thought I was crazy but you could see the smoke from miles away. So they had to send someone out. One cop car quickly turned into two then three. The officers stood over the wreckage confused and scared. I didn't blame them, I still didn't know what to make of all this.

Pretty soon, military vehicles pulled down my one way driveway. They parked in a way that was blocking us from viewing the wreckage. I sat on my porch for forever wondering what was going to happen. There were cops, government men in black suits. And at one point, even guys in hazmat suits. I was never into the paranormal, but even I knew something odd was going on here. That thing wasn't from this world and they knew that. Hours passed and it was after 2 am. A cop came up to me and told me everything was taken care of. He also said that there were gonna be some people here to talk to me first thing in the morning.

He was right about that, the very next day I got a knock at my door. It was a man dressed in a black suit holding a briefcase. He told me his name was frank and asked if he could come inside. I invited him in and put on some coffee. He took it black and sat at the table with a tired expression. “Im just gonna get straight to the point”, he said. “Your land is of interest to the federal government. We'd like to offer you a substantial amount to buy it”. He then put a briefcase on the table and opened it up. There was so much money that I nearly passed out. Stacks upon stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. The man handed me a clipboard and told me to sign on the dotted line.

All that money seemed life changing, but money couldn't make up for memories. My dad worked hard to build this place and I had no right to sell it. I wiped the drool from my face and pushed the briefcase away. I explained that this was family land and I couldn't part with it. He let out a sigh and dropped his head. “That’s very unfortunate to hear. The money was worth far more than this dried up old land”. After offending me, he took the money and left. Things soon went back to normal, or so I thought. I got up early and tended to my farm like always. Feeding all the animals and cleaning up after them. The first thing I noticed was that big eighteen wheelers passed in front of my home.

There were fleets of four and five followed by military vehicles. A different construction company rolled through everyday. Late at night I could hear helicopters flying over my property. So close that my entire house was shaking. My animals stayed spooked and running all over the place. I had no idea what they were doing; there were only woods out here. Things went like this for five months straight; then I’d receive one last visit. Another black vehicle carrying my new buddy Frank. Only this time, he was accompanied by two armed soldiers. He greeted me with a handshake and a smile. Then held up a stack of papers that would change my life. He said that my farm was on military property and I needed to leave. I told him he's crazy, this farm was built by my father forty years ago. He referred to the papers again, assuring me this land had always belonged to uncle sam. I told him he needed to leave now before I called the police. The soldiers stepped up and told me I would be the one leaving. They stuck their rifles in my face and escorted me to my truck. 

What was happening, this was my home and they were taking it from me? I went to the police, lawyers, no one wanted to help me. Next thing I knew I was on the streets with nowhere to go. As of my writing this, I'm living in a rundown apartment and working at a grocery store. I've gone back to my home several times and have been turned away. A giant fence was installed and I couldn't have any of my belongings. The worst part is, I know this is my land. But I don't have any evidence to prove it...they took everything. This all started when I discovered that creature. Perhaps they thought my land was a hot bed for extraterrestrials. And the US government wanted it no matter how low they had to sink.

Regardless, my life was stolen and I'm ready to tell my story. In this country we're supposed to feel safe and live free. But there is a monster lurking just beneath the surface. One that will take what they want when they want and answer to nobody. One nation under lies and control; fight back and they’ll bury you…just like me.

1p2j64h,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1p2j64h/10_days_in_korea_with_toddlers_seoul_pyeongtaek/,"10 days in Korea with toddlers – Seoul, Pyeongtaek, Jeju (6 adults, 2 kids ages 2 & 4) | Nov 6–16","# TL;DR

* **Who:** 3 couples (ages 35–40) + 2 kids (2 & 4 y/o), fairly active, “nap in stroller” style, slow-paced but still \~10k–28k steps/day.
* **Where:** Seoul → Pyeongtaek → Jeju → back to Seoul (for the flight).
* **Vibe:** Laid-back, good food & shopping, not a “see everything” itinerary. Lots of wandering, repeat neighborhoods, and coffee stops.
* **Kid-friendliness:**
   * **Seoul:** \~8/10 with toddlers – great, but transit + crowds + stroller slow everything down.
   * **Jeju:** Very kid-friendly and felt like a vacation within a vacation.
* **Big tips:**
   * If you’re doing Jeju the same day you fly home: leave **at least 5–6 hours** between landing at Gimpo and your ICN departure.
   * For an **11-seater van in Jeju (Hyundai Staria)**, make sure your IDP has **Class D** checked. We luckily had this checked but they also didn’t inform us until the day before
   * Avoid moving Airbnbs during **Seoul rush hour** (6-8pm) with a big group + stroller + luggage unless you love chaos.

# Who we are & travel style

* **Group:** 3 married couples, all 35–40, reasonably fit. No mobility issues.
* **Kids:** 2 and 4 years old. They nap in the stroller, tolerate walking as long as there are snacks, and attract a *ton* of attention from locals (lots of head pats and waves – very sweet, just a little overwhelming for them at times).
* **Style:**
   * Left the Airbnb around **9 am** most days.
   * Naps on the go in a **double stroller**.
   * Flexible/loose itinerary – lots of repeat areas and meandering instead of “hit 10 attractions a day.”

We walked **10k–28k steps on heavy days**, so even our “slow” days racked up a lot of movement.

# Flights, luggage & stroller strategy

# Flights

* **Route:** SEA → ICN (Incheon) direct on **Korean Air**, departing \~11:00, landing \~16:00 local time. Return was ICN → SEA at 16:00.
* **Korean Air economy:**
   * Pillow, blanket, slippers at every seat
   * Kids also got child-sized slippers, which was adorable
   * Meals were really good – highly recommend choosing the bulgogi meal if it’s an option.
* **Kids & jet lag:**
   * We didn’t have a sophisticated strategy. They were awake most of the flight, rotating adults, watching movies, and taking short naps
   * They went to bed around 10-11pm that first night and woke \~06:00, which honestly wasn’t bad.

# Luggage setup (worked really well for shopping-heavy trip)

* Me: **35L Cotopaxi Allpa** as my main bag (all clothing and toiletries)
   * I also brought a **Purple travel pillow** because I find a lot of Airbnbs have terrible pillows, and that was clutch.
* Husband: **45L Peak Design backpack** (camera + electronics) + **Away carry-on**.
* Checked Luggage:
   * **1 x Away Medium** suitcase
   * Inside it: an **empty Away carry-on** and a **Nemo** **70L packable double-haul convertible duffel/tote** (love this bag, so useful!)
* This was PERFECT for all the clothes and skincare we bought. We basically arrived light and left full

# Stroller rental

* Rented a **double stroller from Klook**, picked up at **Incheon T2**.
   * Cost: \~**154,000 KRW** (\~$105) for **10 days** (about 15,400 KRW/day).
   * Pickup was smooth – we messaged the contact upon landing and a staff member rolled it out to meet us
* This stroller was essential for the kids to nap on the go and survive the walking
   * We used it in Seoul and Pyeongtaek, but didn’t end up taking it with us in Jeju

# Where we stayed (4 different Airbnbs)

# 1. Bukchon Hanok Village, Seoul (Nov 6–10)

Airbnb:[ https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/875927200295334450](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/875927200295334450) Cost: **$3,218.30** for 4 nights

* **Layout:**
   * 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms.
   * One larger “wing” of the house with 2 beds, a bench, and its own bathroom.
* **Aesthetic:** Super **Instagram-worthy**, classic Bukchon feel with a little garden and sliding doors.
* **Pros:**
   * Location was fantastic – quiet, walkable, easy to reach from the airport bus.
   * Direct airport bus to **Anguk** stop, then \~10-minute walk with luggage & stroller.
* **Cons (with kids):**
   * Space was overall quite small – tiny bathrooms, limited counter space.
   * The garden + sliding doors made it feel less “kid-proof.”
   * My 6-foot husband felt like a bull in a china shop.
* We brought **S-hooks** which really helped us hang things and create more usable space.

# 2. Large apartment outside central Seoul (Nov 10–11)

Airbnb:[ https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1383170857628472302](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1383170857628472302) Cost: **$203** for 1 night (for all 6 adults + 2 kids)

We added this last minute because our Bukchon place wasn’t available when we decided we wanted to stay a little longer in Seoul.

* **Layout:**
   * 3 very large rooms.
   * 1 full bathroom + 1 toilet-only bathroom.
* **Pros:**
   * **Huge space**, washer/dryer, full kitchen.
   * Convenience store on the corner.
   * Incredible value for the size.
* **Cons:**
   * **5 flights of stairs**, no elevator. Hauling multiple suitcases + stroller was rough.
   * Quite far out from the main areas of Seoul, so more transit time. Was only 3 min walk from the subway but is in the middle of a steep hill

Moving here during evening rush hour on the subway (6–8 pm) with all our luggage and the double stroller was one of the **most stressful parts** of the trip. We ended up splitting between cars because we couldn’t all squeeze in and still get off together in time.

# 3. Pyeongtaek Airbnb (Nov 11–12)

Airbnb:[ https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1254687846103319913](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1254687846103319913)Cost: **$262** for 1 night

We went to Pyeongtaek because my friend’s dad is stationed at the army base there, so this was a must-visit stop.

* **Vibe:** Large house set near farmland.
* **Pros:**
   * Big space, had kid-friendly toys.
   * Quiet, easy base to visit our family friend.
   * Fun novelty: we saw US-style outlets in the walls.
* **Cons:**
   * Being on/near farmland, it smelled like manure outside. Understandable but worth knowing if you’re sensitive.
   * The US outlets didn’t actually work, so don’t rely on them. We used our own travel converters.

We borrowed my friend’s dad’s car to go to **Costco (\~20 mins away)**. The next morning we trained back up toward Gimpo.

# 4. Aewol, Jeju (Nov 12–16)

Airbnb: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/977679616157639559](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/977679616157639559)

Area: **Aewol** on the north side of the island.

Cost: **$1,280** for 4 nights.

* Layout:
   * Parking right outside the Airbnb.
   * 2 couples took the upstairs, (2bd, 2 bath, kitchenette, balcony with unobstructed view of the water)
   * The family of 4 had the downstairs.
* **Host:** Very responsive, maybe a little *too* chatty via text, but nothing problematic.
* Would 100% stay in this area again with toddlers. You do need a car, but the setup was great for a group.

# Getting around: Seoul vs Jeju

# Seoul

* Main modes:
   * Walking, K.ride (foreigner version of Kakao taxi), and Uber
      * If you’re prone to motion sickness, bring Dramamine — some taxi/van drivers (in both Seoul & Jeju) are not exactly gentle on the gas/brakes.
   * We occasionally used T-money cards for subway/bus (we initially loaded 10,000 won but had leftover)
* With our large group + double stroller + timing, we ended up preferring ride-hailing over public transit more than expected. It wasn't an exorbitantly expensive split among 6 adults.

**Stroller & subway reality:**

* Finding elevators in some stations can be a scavenger hunt, especially with a double stroller.
* Seongsu and Myeongdong were the trickiest areas with the stroller (massive crowds, tight sidewalks).
* Bukchon and Insadong were much more chill and stroller-friendly.

If you’re moving Airbnbs with luggage + stroller in Seoul, I’d avoid rush hour (6–8 pm) at all costs.

# Jeju

* Rented an **11-seater Hyundai Staria** from Nov 12–16 for about **$202** total for 4 days total.
   * Pickup was incredibly easy and the van itself was super comfortable.
* **IDP warning:** If you’re renting a van of this size, make sure your **International Driving Permit has Class D checked**.
   * We got ours from **AAA Bellevue** (the only AAA in Washington that issues IDPs in person).
   * In-person cost ended up **$50 total**: $20 for the IDP + a $30 in-person processing fee (which was… annoying).
   * My husband and a friend with a CDL both automatically had Class D checked on the IDP; they didn’t scrutinize it at AAA, but Jeju rental companies do care. Another friend had their IDP from Vegas and they only had class B checked and was unable to drive the van.
* **Car seats**
   * We rented **2 car seats** with the van for about **$46 total**. They were good quality and easy to use.

**Driving:**

* Very manageable with Naver for navigation.
* Driving end-to-end on Jeju is about **45–60 minutes**, similar to driving across Kauai or Oahu.
* Pack LOTS of car snacks for the kids.

# Day-by-day itinerary

# Nov 6 – Arrival, Bukchon

* Landed at ICN around 16:00.
* Picked up double stroller at T2.
* Took the **airport bus (17,000 KRW/adult)** to **Anguk**, then walked \~10 minutes to our Bukchon Airbnb.
* Got settled, then walked to a nearby bossam restaurant for dinner and crashed.

# Nov 7 – Insadong + Myeongdong

* Morning
   * Breakfast at [Jayeondo Salt bread](https://naver.me/FTXw42uI) (Ikseon-dong); 12,000won for 4, worth the hype! Get there at 9am for fresh baked salt bread
   * Taegeukdang Insadong branch - One of our favorite coffee places our our whole trip, delicious latte. Upstairs so not stroller friendly.
* Afternoon/evening
   * Headed to **Myeongdong** for shopping + street food. Crowded but fun; stroller required some weaving.
   * Lunch: [Myeongdong Kyoja](https://naver.me/F2Zuxg9I). Easy wait since there are two separate buildings, the main one for groups smaller than 5 people and another building for larger groups. Known for their mandu but their Bibimguksu was my favorite
   * Dinner: [Samgyeopsal here](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/37531705?placePath=%2Fphoto). Honestly wasn’t impressed, went here for high reviews on Naver but wasn’t worth the wait

# Nov 8 – Seongsu + Seoul Forest + Bukchon

* Morning
   * Breakfast at [Onion Anguk](https://naver.me/xeAflRKM). This place was hyped all over social media but I’d say this was a skip as well. Not worth the line aediocre pastries. We went to so many other places during our trip that blew this place out of the water.
* Afternoon
   * **K.ride to Seoul Forest** for some greenery and space for the kids to run around. Was about 18,000won/$12USD for the 30 min ride
   * Explored **Seongsu** (“the Brooklyn of Seoul”) – cafés and shops. LOTS of adorable pop ups and cafes here. I enjoyed shopping here much better than I did in Myeongdong. Olive Young is packed but organized. I got a great wool coat at Satur and General Idea has great jackets too. Because I went during November, they had Black Friday deals.
* Evening
   * Explored Bukchon

# Nov 9 – Hwadam Forest + Insadong + Gangnam/COEX

* Day trip to **Hwadam Forest** (see notes above on tickets & passports).

[Hwadam Forest](https://preview.redd.it/nj2vryr71i2g1.jpg?width=2592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcb8a1fefb69695a10bd882d1948c53f00238a1c)

We rented a van from Seoul Station for a day trip to Hwadam Forest. This was a huge highlight – the **fall colors were perfect**.

Key tips:

* **Bring everyone’s physical passports**, including the kids, for ticket purchases.
* You **cannot** buy tickets online without a Korean phone number.
* We arrived around 10:00 and all tram tickets were already sold out. If you want tram tickets, aim to arrive **before they open at 9:00**.
* There are electronic kiosks to the left of the staffed ticket booth:
   * These kiosks are **only for the Hwadam museum**, *not* the park itself. We saw the long line for the manned ticket booth and thought we could help ourselves, but we were wrong.
   * Staff clarified this and refunded our mistake, then sold us the correct tickets for the forest. All people in your party must be present so they can verify the passport photo with the person buying the ticket. We had a person in our group wander to get coffee and we had to rush to get him back, staff was understandably not happy. 
* Even without the tram, it was beautiful and worth the trip.
* Evening: **Gangnam** and **COEX** area.

# Nov 10 – Errands, move Airbnbs, Hongdae

* Back to **Myeongdong** to pick up glasses we ordered earlier at **Davich**.
* More time in **Insadong** because we liked the feel there. Got caricatures at Acorn Caricature.
* Moved to our second Seoul Airbnb (big place, 5 flights of stairs).
* Evening in **Hongdae** – younger vibe, fun to walk around.

# Nov 11 – Pyeongtaek

* Train from Seoul to **Pyeongtaek** (\~1 hour, easy to buy tickets online the day before).
* Checked into our Pyeongtaek Airbnb (farmland area)
* Borrowed friend’s dad’s car, quick trip to **Costco (\~20 min)** and walked around **downtown Pyeongtaek**.
* Mostly a family/obligation stop, but nice change of pace.

# Nov 12 – Pyeongtaek → Seoul → Gimpo → Jeju

* Morning: Train from Pyeongtaek back to **Seoul Station**, then transfer train to **Gimpo**.
* Flight to **Jeju** (CJU). We had about a **2-hour delay**, so we arrived around **19:00**.
* Picked up our **Hyundai Staria** van + car seats and drove to our **Aewol Airbnb**.

# Nov 13 – Aewol, hanyeo, tea & markets

* [Cafe Haejigae](https://naver.me/5PVafZj3) – beautiful spot, saw **hanyeo** (female divers) near the water.
* **Osulloc Tea House/Café** – matcha/tea stop
* **Dongmun Market** – lots of food & snacks, lively atmosphere.

[OSulloc Tea Museum](https://preview.redd.it/j8g45m1e1i2g1.jpg?width=3888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e65af69f350e8a3cd8f7429cb8ce3b0976ebb30)

# Nov 14 – Jeju cafés & nature

* **Cafe Noeully** – we spent a good amount of time here just enjoying the views and taking photos. **Hueree National Park** – kid-friendly grounds, good for a slower nature day.
* **Chilseong-ro Shopping Street** – some shopping time.

# Nov 15 – Slow Jeju day, spa & food

* Breakfast at **Saemool Coffee**.
* **Facial & head spa at Mer Beaute** – highly recommend.
   * Men watched the kids first, then we swapped.
   * Perfect relaxing end-of-trip treat.
* Lunch at **Itkansita** – delicious, affordable, and the **banchan alone is almost a full meal**.
* This is also when we finished last-minute shopping via the **Lotte Duty Free app** so our purchases would be ready at ICN.

# Nov 16 – Jeju → Gimpo → Incheon → Seattle (tight but not stressful)

* **6:30am:** Left the Aewol Airbnb at **06:30** for our **09:00** Jeju → Gimpo flight.
* **10:00am:** Arrived at Gimpo 
   * Went straight to buy **airport bus tickets near Gate 1** (important – you need tickets before boarding).
   * Took the airport bus from Gimpo to Incheon (\~13,000 KRW per person).
* **11:30am:** Arrived at ICN 
   * That gave us enough time to:
      * Check in luggage
      * Do tax refund
      * Pick up Lotte Duty Free items
   * Get to our 16:00 gate without feeling rushed but also without a ton of dead time.

**If you’re flying from Jeju to Gimpo and then out of Incheon the same day, I’d not do less than 5–6 hours between landing at GMP and departing from ICN.**

# Food, allergies & kids

* The 4-year-old has **shellfish (shrimp/crab/clam) and peanut allergies**.
   * I printed a card in **English + Korean** explaining this.
   * We honestly didn’t end up needing to use it much, but it was nice to have.
* We ate a ton of samgyeopsal. When I go back, I’d love to eat more Korean seafood but didn’t want to split from the group. The challenge with most Korean restaurants is that they typically have a smaller number of items on the menu so this is tricker with a larger group with varied diets. 
* Spice is prevalent, but we were generally able to find milder alternatives for the kids.

# Data, apps & money

* Bought a 10-day unlimited data eSIM from Airalo and installed it on my Google Pixel 10 – zero issues.
* Used **Naver** and **Papago** extensively for maps and translation. CatchTable was helpful for popular restaurants in areas like Myeongdong.
* Payments:
   * Korea is extremely tap-to-pay/credit-card friendly. We brought $200 USD equivalent in Korean won cash, used some at food markets, and then basically spent the rest just to use it up.
   * Loaded 10,000 KRW onto T-money cards and honestly could have done 5,000 – we used K.ride/Uber more than expected.

# Hard moments & what I’d change

# Hard moments

* Moving Airbnbs in Seoul with all of our luggage + double stroller during subway rush hour (6–8 pm).
   * Trains were absolutely packed.
   * We had so little time to get off that we ended up splitting the group among different cars just to make it work.
* Motion sickness is a real risk; if you’re sensitive, bring meds. Some taxi/van rides were pretty jerky.

# What I’d change next time

* In **Seoul**, I’d try to **stick to one Airbnb** instead of moving, even if it means compromising a bit on location/aesthetics.
* I would add one more full day in Jeju. Ending our Korea trip there was perfect – it really felt like a vacation within a vacation.
* I’d probably plan fewer neighborhood changes per day in Seoul with kids, just because transit and crowds double the time everything takes.

# Final thoughts

* Our trip was slow paced with lots of repeat areas, which is not usually our style (we’re typically detailed-itinerary people).
* But with kids, a big group, and a stroller, this slower approach worked super well. We got to actually *feel* the city rather than just tick off attractions.
* Seoul with toddlers: \~8/10 – amazing but logistically heavier.
* Jeju with toddlers: extremely kid-friendly, highly recommend especially at the end of a Korea trip.

If anyone is planning a similar route (Seoul → Pyeongtaek → Jeju with toddlers, November timeframe), I’m happy to answer questions about specific areas, the strollers, or the Jeju van/IDP logistics

Darkness swaddling me, while memories of what had occurred played over and over again. Swatches of skin and muscular zombies ran through my mind, terrorizing me. But after a while, my mind lost interest in ruminating on my terror and began to wonder. what does she use all that spare flesh for? Surely she used it for something right? I wasn’t the only poor sap who was forced to give up my flesh. My thoughts drifted to the other bulging sacks that were on the rack. More people. Were they waiting for this woman to come back, just like me? Or were they assigned a different fate? One of eternal darkness? I could only hope that wasn’t her plan for me. My stomach rolled over in turmoil as I thought of all the questions she asked me. Was that when she decided if her victims were interesting enough to “work” for? Or was my fate sealed the moment I walked into her web? I could only sit there and wonder.

I'm not sure how long I was hanging there, but it felt like a long time. My thoughts drifted in and out. Sometimes my mind would come back to my situation, wondering if I would ever feel the sun on my skin again. I pictured my own flesh rod, hanging in this dark place, just waiting for someone worthy to walk in for a fitting. Then the void I sat in would overtake me, body and soul, and I’d simply be one with nothing. Just the emptiness and spiders inside. Sometimes my mind would come back to more pleasant thoughts. My family. I could see my brother Josh and I playing video games together. Replaying thoughts of birthday trips with my mom and dad, going to arcades and fishing trips. I spoke to my dad once. I told him I missed him. He didn’t say anything. He wouldn’t say anything, not anymore. I slipped back into the darkness after that. The comfort had worn off. If I thought of my family for too long, I started to wonder If anyone would ever find my body.

My poor mother, having to lose a husband and a child so soon. I wasn’t sure how she would handle it, but judging from how she handled my feathers death, it wouldn’t be well. I only hoped that Josh would be there for her, that they could come together in the absence of anyone else in their lives. I didn’t think it would happen, but I had to hope. For their sakes. They’re both so proud, so stubborn to prove that they're strong. They clashed so much because one of them had to be right and one had to be wrong. They could never find common ground to stand on. Someone always had to talk them into seeing the other person's point of view and make up. I thought of all the things I could have told them before I left, how much more I could have been there for them after my fathers passing, but it was so hard. I had to be there for myself first, I lost a father too. I deserved to have someone pat me on the back and say it would be okay. Why couldn’t someone have done that for me? Like my dad would have? Feelings of guilt, grief, and remorse swirled through my mind. Cursing and missing my family.

And it was gone. Everything was fleeting in this place, this nothing pocket. Even the strongest feelings slipped away with the passing of time. The only constant was the wiggling of chitin within my body, letting me know that I was still alive. The only way to tell that I was still living in a nightmare.

Gradually, my mind began to feel something pressing in. Some outside force was trying to make itself known. Noise. Muffled, far away, but it was growing stronger. A voice, someone was speaking. My mind strained to focus. I was hearing someone speak, so I needed to listen. The voice said “- special day. You may come out in a moment, dearie. I just need to put on some finishing touches.” It was her voice, not the thick monstrous voice from before, but the voice she had used when I met her. I cried out with relief. I was going to be freed, I was going to be let out. I was so happy that I almost didn’t notice that I had used my own voice.

I sat there, shocked. Then I tried to speak. I could feel air rush into my lungs and slide over my vocal chords. All I could do was moan in a low, raspy tone. Still, it was a voice and it was mine. I sat there, moaning for as long and as loud as I could, reveling in the joy of control. Then my brain started to come back to life. If I could speak, use my own voice, then maybe I could move my body again. I sat there, in that darkness, flexing my fingers into fists over and over again, while moaning like the damned, almost crying with joy.

All at once a thought occurred to me. I want out of this.  And now I have the free will to make that happen. I reached my hands forward, taking a fistful of the thick strands in each hand. I began yanking them away, pulling handfuls of the sack apart. I could feel as sections of it came away, strands would lose and tighten, some completely snapping as they took my full weight. The sack was much thicker than it had been when I had first crawled in here. I had to dig a tunnel through the sack wall. But as more threads were destroyed, it began to sage, creating a growing pocket as I lowered to the floor. The resilience of the threads surprised me, they were awfully strong for such thin material. I often had to stop and rest, my arms growing tired quickly. I couldn’t be sure how long it had been since I used them, but I was weaker than I had been before.

Eventually, enough strings had snapped that the sack gave way, splitting open at the bottom and dumping me out onto the floor. I flopped onto the ground in a wet, sticky pile, raw muscle mingling with the dust and dirt on the floor. I slowly sat up, taking my time so I wouldn't hurt myself. When I managed to get up, I took in the room. I was expecting to be met with that same dimness that had enveloped the space before, but now it was brightly lit with a hanging lamp. It was so bright compared to the darkness that I was forced to shield my eyes. I slowly adjusted to the light before I looked round. The flesh rod rack was gone. There was just an empty space where it had been before. The stool and mirror remained in place, exactly where they had been before. The shelf that had been on the back wall was not empty as I had thought, but was cluttered with different kinds of sewing machines. They all looked to be different makes and models, some of them very old. The only thing they all had in common was a thick layer of dust covering all of them.

I stood up, spiders squelching and popping under my feet, as I turned around to take in the sacks. There seemed to be fewer than before. Some of the larger ones were gone, and some new ones had taken their place in different spots. I stared at the sacks that I had been nestled between, when her voice spoke to me from behind. “I’m ready for you, dearie.”

I turned around, eyes falling on a box that was resting on the stool. It hadn’t been there a moment ago. I stared at it for a moment, then my eyes darted towards the door. The thought of escape began to overtake my mind, and this time my body could listen. I took off towards the door, slamming into it and turning the handle at the same time. My body screamed at the exertion, spiders popping randomly inside me as I moved. I turned the handle with all my might, but without my skin, my hands kept slipping as I tried to turn it. The door wouldn't budge, even when I did manage to get the handle turned. I threw my shoulder into it a couple of times, but the only thing I managed to do was kill a few more monsters lurking under my flesh. I was still trapped.

I turned back to the box, spiders wiggling back into place. This time, the woman was standing beside it, a wide grin placed upon her lips. Her fragile form was as dishonest as ever. I slowly crossed the space, placing myself behind the stool, facing the mirror. The woman stood beside me, watching me intently through my reflection. I stood before the box, a hard knot of fear and curiosity pulling down my stomach. Slowly, my courage willed my arm forwards and I lifted the lid of the box. Inside, was a neatly folded, empty suit of skin. The shoulder and upper back were staring up at me. I reached out, lifting it up gently under the armpits and letting it unfold as I pulled it out. The suit was my height exactly, feet dangling just against the floor as I held the thing at shoulder height. Running along the spine of the outfit was an open seam that splayed and twisted as the suit swayed, almost like an open jacket in the wind.

“Well, go ahead” she said “Put it on”. All kindness had left her voice, leaving only anticipation. Her eyes bored into the suit as if she were looking at a freshly cooked steak. I stared at the back of the suit, transfixed by the flawlessness of the skin. The way it curved and connected to itself, almost like a woven tapestry. There were no wrinkles or imperfections, just ripely aged skin.

The old woman reached around me and pulled the flap of the suit open, revealing the insides. Covering the interior of the suit was a thin layer of a translucent white goo. It dripped and flowed from every inch of the inside, pooling down at the feet. I stared, reluctantly, into the thing, before looking at myself again in the mirror. I sat down on the stool, bringing my feet up to the opening and slid my legs into it. I expected to be met with some sort of discomfort, something like putting jeans on after a shower, but there was none. My legs slipped into place perfectly, filling out the flaccid skin. There was no uncomfortable squelching or rubbing from the liquid, in fact, the more I stood there, the less the skin felt like a suit. I gingerly reached down and lifted the torse to my own, sliding my arms into the sleeves of the skin, one by one. After I had all limbs in, I wiggled my fingers and toes. The skin followed, moving with my limbs, but it was odd. Like someone wrapping their hand in paper and using it like a glove, it didn’t quite stick to my hands and feet as I moved. The head dropped down onto the chest as I finished fitting my torso in, sliding the suit over my shoulders. I reached up gently, running my hands through the hair.

Something was wrong.

I could feel my hands grabbing the hair, the effort I put into it. I could feel the pressure that the hair applied to my hand as I squeezed, but I couldn’t FEEL the hair. I grabbed at it, trying again to see if I could sense the follicles gliding across my new palm, but again, nothing unless I gripped the hair hard. I began frantically touching the rest of my body, trying to tell if any part of me could feel it, but nothing. Only pressure was felt through the dead skin.

I started to panic, I had to feel again, I had to! There was no way I was going to spend the rest of my life in a thick glove. I reached up to grab the head of the suit and tried to rip it off, but before I got there, my hand froze. I looked over and gripping my wrist was the old woman's hand. I tried to pull away but her grip was like steel, not even shaking when I tugged with all my might. “There’s no backing out now.” She spat out viciously, then her smile returned. “Just trust the process, dearie”. “NO” I screamed “Let me out of this! I can’t do this anymore! I want to feel! You can’t trap me in here!” my voice cracked and broke at the exertion, iron filling my throat as I continued. “Please! Please! I’ll do anything you want, just don’t seal me into this! I have to feel something!” She just smiled wider, as she grabbed the hood with her other hand and began lifting it to my face. “NO!” I reached with my other hand to grab the hood, to rip it apart before she could entomb me, but another hand gripped my wrist. I could only watch and beg as the gaping mouth and eyes of the hollow mask were slid over my own.

Darkness. The only sensation was the pressure from the hands holding me in place. I could tell another one had pressed itself against the small of my back. The pressure followed up my spine, ending at the back of my skull. Then, all at once, the hands released me. I felt my muscle contort as they tried to open my eyelids, but the skin just slid around as they moved. So, I reached up and pulled my eyes open with my hands. It was a horrid sight. The face fit my head, but it hadn’t slid on properly. One eye had managed to find the eyehole, but every other orifice was met with shiny red muscles poking out from underneath. My face hung a little loose, sloping down to the right side, one ear a couple inches higher than the other. It was as if someone had twisted my head like an ice cream swirl.

The rest of my body was no better, while the skin slipped on perfectly, my body bulged out from underneath some places and retracted at others, creating odd pockets of taut skin, almost as if I was covered in giant popped blisters. I turned my body and my back was much the same. Grotesque skin bulged out from my shoulders blades, creating a long tent of skin running down my back. I turned back round, my skin remaining slightly twisted from the movement.

I looked myself over one more time before I dropped my eyelid and held my head in my hands. I could feel the skin slide around over my face as my hands pushed on the suit. “Is this what I am now?” I asked, my lips not moving with my mouth. “A monster pretending to be human? Something I can’t even look in the eye?” I wasn’t asking her, but she responded as if I was. “What is a monster? Is it something to be afraid of? Ashamed of? Is a monster something waiting to catch you and eat you? Or is it something hiding just out of sight, waiting for someone interesting to wander into its web?”

“I hate you.” I muttered into my hand. “I hate you. I hate you! I HATE YOU!” over and over again I scream into my hands, my voice rising and falling with anger. I said it dozens of times before my voice began to give way and fade to a whisper. I fell into silence, breathing hard. “That's okay dearie. After all, everyone hates monsters.” her voice whispered into my ear, ecstasy and malice marinating in her tone. She began chuckling, the same thick, throaty cough I had heard before. “You are no monster, dearie. Here, I’ll help you see clearly what you have become.”

She took my hands from my face and put them by my side. Then, the eyelids of the suit flew open. My face had been pushed further up on my head by my hands, but the rest of my putrid form remained. As I stared at the Skinwalker in the mirror, the woman whispered into my ear. “Not everything is as it seems dearie, sometimes you have to look deeper than the skin. And while you may not be a monster, you are quite full of them.” I turned to look at her. She seemed to be that same frail woman who had greeted me at the desk, but I had seen a part of what she truly was. This woman was a shadow, or a puppet. Even if she put on clothes and appeared to have the right number of limbs, I could still see the shadows in her eyes and the darkness in her voice.

She continued to stare at me in the mirror even when I looked at her. “Don’t turn away now dearie.” she said “You’ll miss the best part.” I glanced back towards the door, wishing I could be free of this place, then turned to face the mirror. I looked at myself. Hideous, malformed. Nothing happened. Minutes passed, the old woman still standing beside me. Nothing happened. I almost turned to ask the woman if anything was happening, when I felt something shift inside of me.

The spider that had rested under my left eye began to move, scratching and scraping as it clawed its way out of its fleshy cave. It moved up, out of the muscle, and moved directly over my Iris. I watched it in the mirror with my right eye, and stared at its fangs with my left.  It suddenly scurried up, underneath the left eyelid and became a large bump under the skin. I waited, as it scurried between me and the suit. When it stopped near the bridge of my nose, I began to worry. Just what was it doing?

Then pain. Sharp and tearing, coming from the spider. I reached up to grab my face, but halfway there my arm just stopped. I expected the woman's hand to be there, clutching me like before. But there was nothing in the mirror, just my arm, frozen mid air. “Let him work, dearie” sharp stabbing pains followed the spider wherever he went as he traveled around my left eye. Minutes passed as the spider continued to bring me pains, my grunts of anguish the only noise in the room. After the spider made a full rotation around my eye, he crawled out from my nostril and perched on the tip of my nose.

There it stayed, as if waiting for something. The woman next to me began to reach for it. Her left arm crossed over the body, traveling up towards my nose. I wasn’t even surprised when her small arm crossed the vast space between us. She gently pressed her hand to the tip of my nose, inviting the spider. Almost immediately the spider leapt onto it and scurried up her sleeve, out of sight. As she brought her hand back down, I could feel her dry, paper-like skin dragging across my cheek. My skin was gripped and dragged like hairs in a zipper. I shuddered at the touch.

Then I blinked in surprise. I watched as my left eye opened and closed in the mirror. I had felt that awful thing touch me, I could move my eye at will. I stood there blinking over and over, relieved to be part of myself again. I began to grow excited and anxious as a little hope had sparked in me. Maybe I would make it out of this place intact. “Don’t move, dearie. Too many mistakes ruins the final product” I felt my throat tighten at the words. I didn’t know what she did to ruined works, but I didn't want to find out.

Suddenly, all the spiders hiding in my body began to move, shifting and pushing their way out of me. My brain was racked with stimulus, as all over my body nerve endings screamed at the touch of these bugs. Very quickly, lumps began to pop up under the skin, covering my entire body with bumps. They were all still, not ever wriggling as more and more came to the surface. Once I could feel they all got out, there was an eerie calm to them, almost like runners before a race. Then the gun went off.

My body erupted with pain. Spiders crawled up and down underneath the skin, sliding and shifting all over my body. Every inch of me was covered with moving bumps, rolling up and down, like someone boiling a large pot of water. I could feel the spiders ripping my muscles free from one another, rending my fat and tearing at my tendons. Dozens of spiders would clump up and push on my bones, snapping and cracking them into new positions inside of me. I slowly felt the skin become my own as spiders attached muscles to it, sliding fat into places it wasn’t before. I watched as my body very quickly shifted and morphed, filling out the skin suit completely. The odd bulges and sunken spots dispersed as my shoulder grew thinner, my hips narrowed, my legs became thick and full. I think I screamed once or twice, but the clicking of joints in my ears drowned out the noise.

Eventually, the spiders had managed to rework my entire being. Each bump coming to a stop after its work was finished. I stood there, gasping. The air tasted different than it had before. It was more rotten, and less stuffy than it had been. I could feel the cool air of the place sliding over my body, my skin soaked with sweat I didn't know I had. The pain had subsided. I felt a hand grip my shoulder and sit me down onto the stool. I did so, feeling very weak from the experience. Some of the spiders moved to the souls of my feet and began the process again, but it was much more bearable than before. “Thank god it’s over” I muttered between gasps. I was running my hands loosely over the stool, feeling the grain of the wood. My new skin felt well, in fact, it could feel things too well. It was almost too much how the wood grain picked at my flesh as it guided along.

“Not yet” said the old woman, some of the monster slipping back into her voice. All at once, the still lumps covering my body surged upwards, moving towards my head. Spiders began to pour out of my eyes, nose, mouth and ears. They sought any way out, burrowing into my throat and nose, completely filling my lungs. I threw my head forwards and fell onto my hands and knees, heaving giant waves of eight legged monsters. Between heaves, I tried to breathe, but it just drew the spiders back into my body, so I held my breath as best I could. But more and more spiders came, endlessly pouring from my face. My blood began to pound harder as my chest grew tighter. Suddenly, my fear of suffocating overtook my mind and my body took a deep breath. Hundreds of spiders were flung deep into my lungs. I could feel those many legged beings start to panic as they groped around with their legs, searching for an exit. My body suddenly began hacking and coughing, spewing out spiders in large clumps. Several of them were caught in my vocal chords, being crushed between them.

This went on for several minutes. Being forced to breathe, then having to vomit a tide of spiders from my lungs. Eventually, after the last spiders trickled down my chin like spit, I lay back on the floor. I could feel the many crushed spiders in my throat, and my lungs felt raw and rugged, but I was very happy to have those monsters gone. I sat back up, knees sore and back aching, but a strange satisfaction in having endured the process. After I had recovered, I looked up into the mirror.

Staring at me was a stranger. The face was different from my own, but in some ways still the same. My body had changed drastically. Everything about me was different, but I wasn’t any more beautiful or ugly. Just different, like someone was asked to sketch me just from a description. The only imperfection was several still lumps on my body. Suddenly, the bumps began to shrink downwards. Panic flared as I tried to yell “NO” but my throat had not yet recovered. Instead I just screamed as I brought my fists down on the vanishing bumps, trying to kill them all before they could become a part of me. It was a futile effort, even if I got one or two, the rest submerged in me before I could do anything.

I turned to the woman, still smiling. “I want them OUT!” I screamed, with what little voice I had. “All of them! I want them out! Now! NOW!” the woman didn’t move, she just said “I understand, dearie. But every bird must fly the coop at some point. Who am I to deny that freedom?” I stared at her, stunned. Rage boiling with misery in my heart. I picture myself, old, dead. My open casket full of spiders that had lived with me my whole life long. My corpse, nothing more than a glorified silk sack.

Tears began to roll down my cheeks. I couldn’t contain my emotions at all anymore, the pity I felt for myself was too great. “Not satisfied dearie? Come now, you just need to take a closer look” the old woman gestured back to the mirror, inviting me to look at myself again. I turned to see, walking up close to get a good look at myself. I looked into my eyes and studied my face.

My eyes were the only thing that hadn’t changed. The rest of the person in the mirror was still me, but not quite. My forehead was smaller than it had been before, my hairline being further down on my scalp. My eyebrows were less pronounced, with my eyes opening bigger than they had before. My ears were a little lower than before and smaller, but curved further out, making them more noticeable than before. I even had earlobes that detached from my neck now. My nose was a little longer and thinner, coming to a point, rather than being bulbous on the end. My lips were thicker, more full, and my mouth spread wider than it had before. My chin had become sharper, forming more of a point than a curved line.

It was like I was meeting my twin for the first time. I stared for a while, touching and prodding all the changes to my body. I felt a warm glow start to spread through my chest, my lips curling into a smile, further highlighting just how different I was. “What did you do?” I asked, still admiring myself. “Nothing you didn’t want dearie.” I tore myself away from the mirror, turning to face the woman. Still staring at me, she was holding out a box. I slowly walked over to her, apprehension in my footsteps. I gingerly took the box from her, never taking my eyes off hers.

And then she turned away. For the first time, I felt her piercing gaze leave me, finally giving me privacy. The hair on my new neck began to lie flat as I watched her glide towards the door. It opened before she even got to it, and glided out, leaving it ajar. I could see the front door from the back room, the racks parting perfectly to show me the street beyond. I didn’t hesitate, jumping into action as soon as I saw it. I rushed out of the back, tripping and stumbling the whole way, not quite used to my new body. When I did reach the front, I slammed into the front door, bursting out into the street.

It was sunset, on what day I couldn't tell. I looked both ways down the street, seeing if anyone was around. No one, not even a car in sight. I took off back to where I had parked my car, hoping that it was still there. I reached it within a couple of minutes. Thank god I didn’t meet anyone on the way, I don’t know how I would explain why I was naked running down the street. When I did get to my car, I threw the door open and hopped inside, glad that I forgot to lock it before I left. A bad habit of mine paying off for once. I threw the package into the passenger seat.

I sat there for a couple of minutes, letting my body recover from the short sprint. My calves ached and my arms hurt from carrying the otherwise light box. Things that normally would have been no problem for me were suddenly exhausting. It’s like my body could remember what it was like to move and act, but my muscles didn’t quite understand how my brain told them to move. arms and legs shifted oddly, as if the muscles didn’t connect to the right places. Slowly, the soreness faded, and I was left, sitting naked in my car.

As I sat there, my mind wandered back to the box. Looking at it, it was unassuming. A brown paper wrapped box. I thought of what might be inside of it, the shirt being the most obvious idea. My mind began to wonder what other things might be lurking within it and I quickly decided not to open it. Whatever was in there wasn’t worth finding out, at least, not right now. So, I jumped to the next thing. My keys.

I checked the glovebox and there they were, resting on top of my wallet, phone, and watch. I grabbed them and shoved them into the ignition, my car roaring to life. I tried not to think about how I never really open my glove box, let alone store my stuff in there. I took off, quickly making my way back to the motel. I was going well above the speed limit, but no one stopped me. When I got there, I rushed inside, quickly getting dressed. I packed whatever I had out into my bags and stuffed them into the trunk. I had paid for the week and judging by how my stuff was still here, It was still the same week when I first entered the store, so I didn’t feel bad about taking off without a word to the front desk.

I went straight home, only stopping two times on my journey. Once towards the beginning to eat and drink. I ordered a mountain of burgers and drank at least a gallon of water. And once towards the middle of the night, when I was pulled over for spreading. The officer came over to my car and asked for my license and registration. I grabbed both from my glove box and handed them over as fast as I could, eager to get back on the road. The woods around me had me on edge, imagining all the spiders that lived within the forest around, staring at me through the night. It was only when the officer frowned at my I.D. that I realized that my picture must no longer match my face.

I began to panic as he looked from me to the license, clearly noticing the distinct difference between us. I waited to be pulled from my car and cuffed, but the accusations never came. I did consider taking off into the woods, but I could see their eyes out there, waiting for me to go to them. After a couple of minutes he handed me back my license and just told me to “Slow it down”. I nodded, shocked at the response to my I.D. After he left, I examined my license. All my information was the same, but the picture of me matched my new face to a tee, smile and all. I shuddered and slipped the thing back into my wallet. I drove the speed limit the rest of the way home.

I made it back once the sun started to rise. I quickly made my way inside and rushed up to my room, hoping that neither of my family members were awake. I locked my door and lay down in my bed, not sleeping, but listening for movement inside the house. I wasn’t sure what I was going to say to my brother or mother when I saw them, but I didn’t want to wake them with a stranger's face. After about an hour of waiting, I heard someone go down the steps.

I made my way downstairs, seeing that my brother was the one who woke. He saw me and instantly lit up “what are you doing home so soon?” asked Josh. “ You're not supposed to be back for another 2 days.” two days. I was home two days early? But, that means that I was only trapped in that hellscape for a day or two. No, that couldn’t be right. I had to have been trapped there for days on end. The wandering, the sleeping, the sack. None of those things could have been shorter than a day at least. So how was I home early?

“You okay?” Josh asked, a look of concern creasing his face. “Yeah , I’m fine. I just…felt homesick, that's all.” I lied. Josh recognized me. The new me. He didn’t seem to notice that I was different or changed. He just saw me. “I’m glad you're back, I don’t know if I could have done another day alone with mom.” “Hm?” I asked “are you sure you're okay? You seem … spacier than usual.” “ I’m fine Josh, I'm just recovering from my trip.”

How could I tell him? Where would I begin? Would he even believe me? Would I believe him if he told me something like this? No, I decided right then that I would keep this to myself. If no one could see the change but me, then I wasn’t going to point it out to them. Instead, I told him about the first two days and made up some lies around the rest. He seemed to believe them, nodding and laughing when appropriate. After some time, my mother came downstairs. She came into the kitchen to make her morning coffee, but stopped when she saw me. She looked at my brother, then me, then back to my brother.

“I’m sorry, but do I know you? Are you a friend of Josh?” I felt my face flush as my brother looked at my mom in confusion. “Mom, are you going senile? You can’t even recognize your own children anymore?” Usually, these were the type of snide remarks that would make my mother snap at Josh, starting a day long argument. Instead she just looked at him, then back to me again. “Oh.” she said, nodding slowly. Then she walked over to the sink and began washing dishes. There were only a couple plats in the sink, but she spent the rest of the time there, turning her back to us. After a short time of glancing at my mother, I couldn’t stomach it anymore. I made my excuses and went back up to my room.

And that's what my life has become. Almost every person in my life continued to recognize me, so I just went on living how I used to. The only difference was my mother and I avoided each other around the house. Any room that I walked into was quickly vacated by her and any time she approached me to ask who I really was, I just told her I was her kid. Plain and simple. I could tell she never believed me, no matter how much I knew about my life. My brother began to resent her more, getting into more arguments daily than they had before. I couldn't be their guardian for each other, not anymore.

I moved out. I couldn’t stand the haunting look my mother gave me from time to time, and even worse was the spiders under my skin. How they would squirm with joy at every argument that I didn’t stop. I began to resent my relatives for their fighting and their own inability to grow past their pettiness. So when my job asked me to take up a better position, far away, I said yes almost immediately. I packed up everything I owned and moved out the next day. I told my brother goodbye and to come visit from time to time. He seemed sad that I was leaving, but I think he understood. He could see the way mother looked at me too. I hadn’t told her I was moving, but I caught one last glimpse of her. A scowl, staring at me from a window as I pulled out of our driveway. I didn’t feel sorry. I didn’t look back to see if she watched me leave.

When I began unpacking in my new apartment, I sorted everything by the room it would go in. I had all my boxes labeled, so I found it strange when one didn’t have any writing on it. It was an unassuming brown, paper wrapped box. I picked it up and instantly recognized where it was from. It hadn’t been that long, maybe a year at most. But it was hard to forget about the experience, and the package I had been given as a reward. I stared at the thing for a long time, reliving the experience all over again in memory. When I got to the end of the story, I decided to open the box this time. I’m not sure why, but some part of me still felt trapped there, not knowing.

Inside was the shirt that I had picked. Still in the same ragged condition I had picked it up in. second hand, lint covered wool shirt. It was neatly folded, resting near the top of the box. I picked it up, checked all over for spiders and when I couldn’t find any, I slipped it on. It fit just as the woman had advertised it would. It clung to every bit of my body just right. It didn’t even feel like I was wearing a shirt, rather, like I had slipped on a second layer of skin. I admired myself in one of the mirrors I had unpacked. It looked great on me too. I ripped it off and tossed it into the corner of the room. I would burn it later with the box.

Next, under the shirt, was something else wrapped in brown paper, with a note resting on top of it. I set the letter to the side and ripped open the paper. The bright yellow streak made me drop the package, flinging it back into the box. I sealed it and quickly turned to the letter. Inside the envelope was a typical business card printout you’d see at any clothing store. In neat, printed calligraphy it read “Thank you for shopping at Mrs. Archean’s Woven Boutique. We hope that you enjoy your purchase and consider returning for more in the future.” on the bottom, drawn on in pen, was a little arrow pointing to the back. I flipped the card over, revealing a neatly scratched message. “Hello, Dearie. You may have noticed an extra item included in your package. It had taken a liking to you, so I added it to your order, no extra charge. After all, you and it have so much in common now.” there was more written under it. “P.S. In the jacket, I have included a piece of what was lost.”

That was it. I read it over and over again, staring at the box. Dread filled me as I realized I was going to open it. I had to, I had to know what I lost. What made my mother hate me. I opened the box, the package now throbbing with spiders. I laid the jacket down, opening the zipper and revealing the inside. Millions of spiders scuttled over one another, pushing and pulling on the fabric, as entire swaths of spiders moved this way and that, seemingly going about their own business. None left the jacket. None moved, not even when I picked the jacket up and flung it about. They clung to the inside and refused to get out of my way. So I plunged my hand into the mass of them, searching for what I had “lost”.

I went back to that place, covered with spiders over and over, filling within me, vomiting them, breathing them. I felt them inside of me, they squirmed and clicked with joy at being reunited with their family, a joy I could not know. I forced myself to move my hand around, searching through the hairy mass for something. All I could feel was the thicket of arachnids bulge and change with the movements of my hand, slipping and sliding over my skin. I could feel them dig into my fingers, fangs meeting flesh over and over. Then I felt it, something rubbery, solid. I gripped it and ripped it free of the spiders. Not one of them came up with it, or my arm. They remained within the jacket, staring at me with hate. I slammed the open jacket back into the box as fast as I could and sealed it again, adding it to my burn pile in the corner.

I picked up the mass I had pulled from the jacket. It appeared to be something wrapped in a sheet of leather. Skin. it had been dried and aged, but it was skin all the same. I gently opened the wrapping, careful to make sure there were no spiders. Inside the neat rectangle of skin, rested an old, worn out polaroid. In the photo was my father and me, standing next to each other at my nineteenth birthday party. He had his arm wrapped around my shoulder, pulling me into a sideways hug as I threw myself into him. We both had huge grins on our faces, like we had heard a great joke. It struck me just how much we looked alike. Same squinting eyes, same oddly shaped nose. Even down to how rounded our chins were, almost making a circle around our faces. We looked so happy. Just like how it used to be. Just like I used to be. I looked at myself in the mirror, all joy robbed from my face and began to weep. I didn’t stop crying for a long time. After all, how could you stop after losing your father a second time?",2,1763682490.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

In her most recent video her friends and family say that she has been bedridden for years, barely able to walk or to speak.

This interested me because I had never heard of ME/CFS up until that point.  Wikipedia calls it ""a contested illness, with debates mainly revolving around the cause of the illness and treatments.""  I started doing some searches on the condition but almost immediately ran into some red flags.  There is an entire wiki for ME/CFS which lists a grab bag of symptoms and lists basically everything from drinking coffee to traditional Chinese medicine as a potential treatments.  The wiki also lists toxic mold exposure and so called ""chronic lyme disease"" as potential causes, which struck me as kind of weird.

There also seems to be a certain level of hostility towards doctors and medical researchers in ME/CFS spaces.  Like ""chronic lyme"" advocates these people seem to have a history of harassing researchers who say things they disagree with.  As per Wikipedia, there is at least one instance where someone ended their research due to harassment from ME/CFS activists, and other cases of researchers receiving death threats.   It seems that the controversy is over whether or not ME/CFS is psychosomatic and, by extension, if psychotherapy is an effective treatment.

Is ME/CFS a legit illness?  I have heard people say it is real and that medicine just doesn't understand it yet, I have heard people say it is all just mass hysteria, and I have heard people say the truth is in-between, that like Celiac or Lyme disease it is real but you have a lot of healthy people gaslighting themselves into thinking they have it.

“Lonely?” I couldn't help questioning my colleagues, who only shot each other cryptic glances. They were nice enough. 

I received obligatory greetings that seemed too practised. 

Almost like each had been meticulously rehearsed. 

“It’s different this year,” one of the second-years told me as I dumped my stuff in my locker. 

His name was Dr. Harley, a surgeon several years older, with a thick four o’clock shadow and dark circles under his eyes. 

He clapped me on the shoulder with a grin, straightened his scrubs, and slipped on his lanyard, giving himself a quick once-over in the mirror. 

“Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. It just takes some time to get used to.” 

As he brushed past me, his breath fluttered my ear. “Believe it or not, this place is actually *haunted*.” 

When I walked into the residential lounge for my first meeting, I expected an empty room—or worse, to be outcast. 

But I was pleasantly surprised.

An empty box of sushi hit me squarely in the face upon opening the door, and I came to an unsure halt. 

It felt like walking into a game. 

A woman was halfway across the room, mid-yell and laughing, while the offender stood on a Craigslist couch, brandishing an empty soda can like a weapon. 

Another guy rolled his eyes behind a book, unimpressed. 

The thrower, a fuzzy redhead, crossed the room in a single stride.

“Time out!” he shouted, glaring at the woman. Then his eyes landed on me. 

“Yooo, we’ve got a newbie,” he announced, reaching for my hand. His fingers were refreshingly cool. “Sup! I’m Dr. Matthews, but call me Will.”

He pointed to the others. “That’s Dr. Carlisle and Dr. Faraway.”

The girl shot me a grin, dropping the sushi lid. “There’s no need for formalities,” she said, her smile bright. She reminded me of a human golden retriever, with long brown hair and wide eyes, no dark circles, not even a hint of exhaustion. 

“Just Olivia is fine,” she trilled, “Hey there!”

“Jake,” the other R1 muttered. A freckled blond with a ponytail and his feet propped on the table. 

He didn’t even glance up from his notes. I’d already pegged him as the smart-ass. “Welcome to Hell.”

A senior official stepped in, taking in the chaos of the room. 

His eyes locked on me despite the over two very clearly in battle mode. 

“Dr. Marks,” an older man with greying hair and crumbs in his beard, introduced himself as Dr. Lan, arms crossed. 

He didn’t bother looking at the others; he probably didn’t need to. “Let’s keep things professional.” 

He nodded at me to toss the sushi tray. “You’re in the workplace now,” he said. “Act like it.”

“You’re in the *workplace* now,” Will mimicked under his breath, exaggerating Dr. Lan’s Southern drawl. Jake smirked, and Olivia ducked her head, giggling behind her notes. These three were a riot.

Dr. Lan’s gaze suddenly shot to Will, his expression twisting, eyes narrowing. 

Maybe the sun was in his eyes. Will was standing directly in front of the window. 
“Is something *funny*, Dr. Matthews?”

Jake’s eyes widened, his gaze snapping to our superior. “What?” 

Dr. Lan wasn’t messing around. “Perhaps you want to share your hilarious joke with the rest of us?”

Will ducked his head, hugging his arms around himself. “I apologize, Dr. Lan. I acted unprofessionally.”

“Will—” Jake hissed, but Will jabbed him in the gut. Olivia shot him a death glare.

I detected some kind of rebellion against our superiors. 

Not something I’d expect in a workplace. 

These people were in their late twenties. This wasn’t high school. 

Dr. Lan’s gaze lingered on the two of them for a moment before he twisted and yanked open the door. He didn’t scold, but he didn’t need to. His expression said it all. 

“Dr. Marks, please follow me.” 

I found myself nodding and falling in step. 

“Don’t expect me to wait. Stay by my side and do not ask stupid questions, and I will tolerate you. You will be working on the paediatric ward with me today.”  

I followed him out of the residential lounge, the other R1s joining in step. 

My morning went just as I thought. I was expected to observe. 

The four of us stood around a child propped up on pillows in the paediatric ward. “Dr. Marks,” Dr. Lan called on me, of course.  “how would you manage mild dehydration in this two-year-old patient?”

Next to me, Will spoke up. He was surprisingly intelligent, considering his antics. “Uh, well, first I’d start with a 20 ml isotonic saline bolus, then reassess, and continue oral rehydration once stable.”

Lan ignored him. “Dr. Marks. I ask you a question, I expect you to answer it.”

I panicked and blurted Will’s response in a string of word vomit I immediately tried to swallow. “20 ml of isotonic bolus and reassess until stable.” 

Dr. Lan folded his arms. “Good. And if the patient’s condition deteriorates?” 

“Evaluate for underlying causes and conduct frequent assessment of urine output,” Olivia stated, lifting her head. 

I noticed Olivia had a little quirk: she tightened her ponytail whenever she answered a question. 

Will, on the other hand, fidgeted constantly, playing with his pen, or twirling a single strand of his hair.  

Jake was stiff. Robotic. Cool as a cucumber.

“If they’re deteriorating, I’d escalate care,” he added. 

His response was to-the-point, his gangly sandy blonde frame partially hidden behind Olivia. “I’d reassess immediately, repeat fluids if needed, and escalate to ICU support if they don’t improve.”

“Dr. Marks,” Lan barked. “What is required if the patient’s condition worsens?” 

Why was I the only one being lectured?

I flailed, catching Jake’s smirk. He was enjoying this. Being ignored. Something about it thrilled him. 

“Urine output,” I panicked, clearing my throat. “Monitor urine output, evaluate underlying causes, and repeat fluids.”

It was obvious I was just parroting my colleagues. 

But Dr. Lan didn’t even raise an eyebrow. “Correct.”

Will nudged me with a grin when we moved to the next patient.  “Someone’s popular!” 

“Dr. Lan,” one of our patients, a seven-year-old with cystic fibrosis, looked up from his DS. “Will is a good doctor,” he pulled a face. “Why do you keep ignoring him?”

Will strode over to the kid, ruffling his hair. “Ignore Dr. Lan,” he teased. “He’s got favorites.""

By the end of the day, the other three fully abandoned me to all duties. I had watched three deliveries and witnessed an infant’s death. 

A teenage girl was rushed in and gave birth to twins before bleeding out on the surgical bed. She was fifteen. I was the one who broke it to her father.

I was alone, exhausted, frustrated, every muscle aching, with no one to help. 

I paged Will over and over, but his pager didn’t go through. 

Olivia and Jake were nowhere to be found. 

Dr. Harley brought me coffee on our way down to surgery. 

“Have you seen Dr. Matthews?” I asked him, burning my tongue when I gulped it down. “I can't page him.”

“Matthews?” He frowned. His expression slackened. “Shouldn't you know that?”

“It's my first day,” I smiled through a grimace. “I barely know him.” 

Dr. Harley dumped his own coffee. “Upstairs,” he said. His tone hardened. “Focus, Dr. Marks.” 

By midnight, I was running on autopilot, the ward overflowing, with maybe five minutes to spare.

I crashed into the residential lounge hoping to finish the sandwich I left on the table. The light flickered on and I almost jumped out of my skin. 

Will was cross-legged on his laptop. 

Olivia was snoozing on the temporary bed they had set up, and Jake sat staring into oblivion. 

“Yooo, newbie.” Will looked up from his laptop, grinning. “How was your first day?”

“Where were you?” I demanded. “You’ve been MIA all night, leaving me to handle everything!” 

Will’s smile bled away. His gaze dropped. “Busy,” he said.

“Busy?” I shot back. I slumped into a chair, eyeing the sandwich. I gave it an experimental sniff and stuffed it in my mouth. “You’ve been slacking off.”

“Grace,” Jake muttered, shooting me a glare. “Shut up. You have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My blood boiled. I spat out the sandwich. “What?”

“We can’t go onto certain wards,” Olivia mumbled into her pillow, rolling over. “We’re not allowed.”

I laughed, even though I knew I shouldn’t. “You’re not serious.” My head spun as I stepped forward. 

I fought back a screech, but the words burst out anyway, bubbling on my tongue like soda pop. “You can’t just leave me to handle everything alone!”

Olivia was sitting up now, legs swinging off the bed. She swiped at her eyes. Was she actually crying?

I turned to Jake. He seemed like the only one with any backbone. 

“Were you in here this whole time?” I gestured toward Will, who slammed the laptop shut, looking suddenly sheepish. 

“I’ve been downstairs watching children bleed out in front of me, and you’ve been up here playing Minecraft?”

Jake stood up, hands in his pockets, and strode over, stopping just three inches from my face.

“Grace,” he said quietly, his voice dropping into a low growl. “You’ve crossed the line.”

“Is it connections?” I demanded, breathless. I knew I was crossing a line, going way too far, but I couldn’t stay calm and emotionless any longer. 

I was too fucking human to be a nurse. I couldn’t just smile, grin, and bear it. 

“You’re rich kids with powerful parents. You don’t have to play by the rules. Is that why I can’t even talk about you?”

I couldn’t resist a bitter laugh as I stepped closer. 

Jake’s breath brushed my cheek, but he didn’t back down. His eyes narrowed.

 “Like I said,” he grunted. “You have no idea what you’re talking about, Grace.”

“You three think you own this hospital,” I spat. “It’s all a power play. You’ve got connections that let you get away with murder, slack off, and play your little games, while I’m left holding the pieces! You snap your fingers, and the higher-ups roll over. Is that it? What are you, nepo babies?”

Jake folded his arms over his scrubs. “So what if we *are*?” He stepped closer, teasing his proximity. 

“What if we *are* abusing our positions and terrorizing our colleagues?” His lips curled into a smirk. “What exactly are you going to do about it?”

“Jake.” Will’s voice cut through me, cold, like splintered glass. 

His frenzied eyes found mine, a and a sliver of ice trickled down my spine. 

“We’re not nepo babies,” he looked away. “It’s… complicated.”

“Complicated.” I repeated. I turned to Olivia, who was silent, staring down at her lap. “Then explain! Tell me why you disappeared for nine hours—”

I didn’t realize I was shouting until the door opened and Dr. Lan stepped inside. 

He was holding a small bag, swinging it between his fingers. 

“Dr. Marks,” he said sharply, but his expression immediately softened. 

He sighed, and instead of scolding me, he motioned for me to follow. 

“Come with me.” 

“Dr Lan,” I managed to choke out. “The others—”

“Now.” 

The trio trailed behind as I was led on a walk of shame. 

Dr. Lan didn’t take me to his office. Instead, he stepped into an elevator and motioned for us to follow. Olivia hesitated, stepping back, but Jake tugged her inside. “I don’t understand,” I whispered as Dr. Lan led me down a long, winding corridor. 

It was too quiet. My steps felt heavy, my breath shallow, as we passed through a swinging door and into the sharp smell of antiseptic.

Soft, rhythmic beeps sliced through an otherwise silent ward. 

I looked at Dr. Lan for some kind of direction, but to my surprise, he wasn't there for work purposes. 

He produced a bouquet of flowers from the bag and strode towards the patient on the far side of the room. My gaze dropped to the patients.

One of them made my heart lurch. I felt myself unravel, coming apart, body, mind and soul at once until I couldn't breathe, until every breath felt forced, my lungs fighting for oxygen. I sensed my body falling, my knees hitting ice cold porcelain.

But I was still standing, legs wobbling, stomach twisting. 

Will.

He lay there, hooked up to monitors, surrounded by a mix of fresh and rotting flowers. His eyes were closed, his skin sickly pale. 

I felt myself backing away instinctively. There was no escape. 

The walls pressed in, too clinical, too white, too wrong. This couldn’t be real. My hands ripped at my ponytail. 

I spent the whole day with them. 

I talked to them. 

Olivia lay on his left, a halo of dark curls spilling across the pillows. 

Jake’s face was covered beneath a plastic mask.

Dr. Lan hovered over Will, checking his vitals and gently fluffing his hair.

“Our R1s were in a serious accident a few months ago,” he said quietly. 

“While transferring a patient to another hospital, there was a crash. We thought they might survive, but over the last few weeks, we had to induce a coma. They were declared brain dead yesterday.""

He moved slowly to Will’s bed, arranging flowers beside him, then to Jake’s, picking up get-well cards and reading each carefully. 

“William was the only doctor who questioned me,” he murmured, smiling at the empty space where Will stood beside me. 

“Olivia was a wonderful nurse. That girl would have gone far in medicine.” 

I pretended not to hear Olivia sniffling behind me.

“And Jacob,” Dr. Lan finished. Jake’s eyes flicked to me, mouth curving into a scowl. 

I was certain he hadn't forgotten the nepo baby comment. “An old soul trapped in a young body. Book smart and popular with female patients.”

Lan sighed. “We will be taking them off oxygen soon,” he said, his voice slipping back into professional calm. Then he met my eyes. “I believe they are at their end, holding on.”

“That’s a lie,” Jake snapped, the words slicing through the fragile calm. He slumped beside his own body, glaring at the doctor. “He can definitely see us.”

“He obviously can’t,” Olivia said, wiping at her red, swollen eyes. “Dr. Lan looks right through us.”

Will didn’t answer. He kept casting uneasy glances at his motionless body.

“Dr. Lan,” I whispered.

My voice broke on the last word, sharp and humiliating.

Too human. I barely registered that I was staring at empty air, speaking to empty air. 

I had been talking to my imagination all day. A sour burn crawled up my throat. “I need to go to the bathroom.”

Dr. Lan’s eyes lingered on Will’s body. “Go ahead.”

Will stepped in front of me. “Grace,” he said.

I shook my head. “I need to get out of here.”

“We were waiting for your shift to end,” he whispered. “We didn’t expect Dr. Lan to show up.”

I shoved past him. He felt physical, warm, real. His skin was clammy. 

His coat was real, brushing my fingertips. 

How had I missed the warning signs? 

How could I have been so stupid, so careless?

“Get away from me,” I choked out, then remembered he wasn’t actually there. “I’m okay. I just need air.”

“Dr. Marks.” Dr. Lan’s voice startled me. “Please keep this confidential for the time being. The only ones who know are the family and hospital staff.”

“What?” Will strode over, standing directly in front of him.  “What does that mean?”

*“It means our deaths weren't an accident,” Jake spoke up.

*“Can you not say that?” Olivia squeaked. “He said it was a crash!” 

I barely registered the trio’s conversation as it bounced around me, collapsing into white noise.

With permission, I staggered out of the ward, my head spinning. 

I barely reached the girls’ bathroom before collapsing to my knees, my forehead thudding against the ice-cold toilet seat as vomit-tasting sobs racked my chest. 

By the time my stomach was empty, I was shaking with exhaustion.

I was going crazy.

“And you thought we were *nepo babies*.”

The voice froze my blood. The flash of light blue scrubs was unmistakable. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a familiar figure sitting with his knees pulled to his chest, arms wrapped around them. 

Dr. Jake Faraway. 

Mr. Dead the whole time. 

I didn’t turn around. My hands clung to the toilet seat, my breath coming out in a shaky rush. 

Guilt was already tearing me apart from screaming at him earlier. 

His ghost showing up in the girls’ bathroom to hammer it in was just cruel.  

“I didn’t know,” I managed, my voice catching, choking on bile making its reappearance. “I’m sorry.”

“Don't flatter yourself. I didn’t follow you for an apology,” he muttered into his knees. 

“So, you've come to gloat,” the words spewed from my mouth before I could stop them.

He laughed. “About what? Being dead? You couldn’t have known. When I first woke up, I didn’t realize anything was wrong. Not until I tried to go home and bam—I was smack back in the hospital.” 

Jake shot me a rare smile. “I like to think the residential lounge is like our respawning point.” 

“You didn’t see your body?” I asked.

He exhaled. “Nope. But there was a lot happening on the ICU ward. I figured we had critical patients.”

“Who were…” I swallowed my words.

Jake sighed, nuzzling into his knees and turning his head to look at me. He offered a sickly smile. 

“Imagine my shock when I follow my colleagues to see what the hell is going on, and I see my own dumbass getting cardiopulmonary resuscitation.”

His expression twisted, and for a moment, I thought he might show real emotion, brows furrowing, lip curling, like he was about to cry but had trained himself not to. 

Jake was good at suppressing it. 

Unlike me, he could hide his humanity. 

The perfect doctor. 

“They brought me in first,” he said, closing his eyes. “Then Will and Olivia, who were in pretty bad shape. I found them in the resident lounge, and they thought I was messing around. I was like, no man, seriously, you are literally getting life-saving surgery downstairs.”

“They didn’t believe you,” I said.

He groaned, tilting his head back, eyes scanning the ceiling. “Would you?” 

His gaze flicked to me. “Imagine if we told you when you first came in. ‘Hi, Grace! Nice to meet you! By the way, we’re actually comatose upstairs, and you’re talking to our ghosts!’”

Nausea curled deep in my gut. 

I turned away, rested my head against the toilet seat, and squeezed my eyes shut. “Why *did* you follow me?”

“I lied.” I could hear the smirk in his voice. “I was fishing for an apology.”

“Asshole,” I muttered.

“In my defence, you did call us nepo babies,” he said. 

I swallowed my argument. “We’re in a hospital, so there has to be more like you.” I choked into ice-cold porcelain. “Are there others on… that side?”

Jake didn't reply for a moment. “Kids, mainly.”

“Kids?” 

“Yeah,” he mumbled into his knees. “The pediatric ward is full of them. Kids who have nowhere to go. Will keeps them company. That’s where he was.”

“But I didn’t see him—”

He cut me off. “You won’t see us all the time. You act like it’s our fault when we slip past your perception. We were in the pediatric ward all day. We saw the girl die, and we couldn’t help you.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, instead of calling myself out.

He groaned. “You apologize a lot. Seriously. Stop doing that.”

I held my breath. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Shoot.”

“Do you think you’ll stay?” I whispered. “When they switch off your oxygen.”

He didn’t respond. The stall suddenly felt cavernous. Lonely.

When I finally risked a glance around, Dr. Jake Faraway had disappeared.

***

I was half expecting the residents’ lounge to be empty when I crashed into it during a quiet period. 

“Hi,” I said to the empty room. “I'm sorry about earlier.” 

Ghosts were never quiet. They were just more annoying humans. 

Will was back at the table, greeting me with an over-the-top grin. This guy didn't know subtlety.

His messy red curls still threw me off, unless he’d looked like that when he died. 

His white coat was thrown over pale blue scrubs. 

I wondered why he was still wearing his work clothes. Olivia was sprawled across the couch, and Jake sat cross-legged on the floor like he was meditating.

I shut the door so I wouldn’t appear crazy.

I had a lot of questions.

After finding out my colleagues weren’t just dead but upstairs clinging to life, I’d freaked out at them like it was somehow their fault. 

If I wanted answers before I lost them for good, now was the time. 

I dropped into a seat at the table, pointedly ignoring Olivia, who was hanging upside down on the couch like a bored bat. 

“So, you guys are actually brain-dead upstairs, and you're stuck in the hospital you worked at,” I said.

“Basically!” Will shot me a grin. “I don’t believe in paranormal crap, and there’s no scientific explanation except one vague, hypothetical theory. Pure conjecture.” 

He propped his chin on his fist. 

“Sooooo, back in 2008, there was this case where a woman claimed she was in a coma but could walk around her ward and talk to other coma patients.” 

His eyes met mine, lips pricking. “So maybe when we died, our consciousness sort of jumped out of our bodies. Like a projection. And that's what we are.”

“Will.” Jake cracked one eye open, exasperated. “We’re not projections. You're an idiot.” 

Dr. Jake Faraway was the younger, long suffering, and apparently deader House.

His permanent frown lines and narrowed eyes made him a real joy to be around. 

Twenty-eight years old with the personality of a boomer. Will was sunshine and theories, Jake was cold logic. Olivia was the depressed glue holding them together.

“We’re ghosts,” Jake said flatly. The words curled on his tongue bubbled with finality. 

“There's no other explanation. We're dead. We’re not coming back. When they turn us off upstairs, we will die.”

Will rolled his eyes. “You don't know that. What if we wake up?”

Jake smacked him playfully over the head. “What part of *brain-dead* do you not understand?”

It sounded like a debate they had had a hundred times before.

Jake exhaled, eyes closing again, like Will wasn't a colleague but a child. 

He shifted onto his butt.  “Ignore him. His amnesia is making him optimistic.”

“Amnesia?” I asked, wandering to the fridge. Inside were beer, water, and expired pasta. 

I grabbed an orange instead and dropped back into my seat. My pager buzzed again. 

I ignored it, popping a slice into my mouth. “So you can’t remember how you died.” 

Jake abandoned his meditation and joined us, this time sitting on the table.

“None of us can,” Jake said. “Just what Dr. Lan told you. That we were transporting a patient.” 

He tilted his head. “Which is strange, because R1s usually don’t get that responsibility. It doesn’t make sense they would trust first-years with transportation.”

Olivia appeared in the chair opposite me, a blur of dark curls and smeared eyeliner. 

She gave me a faint smile, her eyes frantically following my hands as I peeled the orange. Did ghosts get hungry?

I offered her a piece, and she almost took it before shooting me a sheepish smile.

I slipped another piece of orange into my mouth.

“They didn’t even tell me about your accident. I had to find out for myself.” I glanced at Will, who avoided my gaze. 

“You guys had me talking to myself and didn’t mention anything until I saw your---” I refused to say bodies, “your real selves.”

Jake nodded, chin on fist. “That’s a good question. Why didn’t the hospital report it?”

Will rocked in his seat, head tilted back. “That's sus, right? Why didn't they tell anyone else?” 

He suddenly jerked upright with a hiss. “Fuck. This isn’t a Ghost situation, is it? Is that why we’re here?""

""Do we have to remember the accident to come to terms with our deaths, and then we step into a bright light and fade away to Whitney Houston?” 

Jake groaned, burying his face in his arms. “You're driving me insane.” 

“Maybe I don’t want to move on.” 

Will’s lip jutted into a pout. “If this is all easily explained, then when they switch off our oxygen, we’ll just disappear and just like, not exist,” he said, shuddering, “forever.”

“What if we weren’t transporting a patient?” Jake said abruptly, his head snapping up. 

He slammed his fist on the desk. Will almost flew out of his chair and Olivia shot him a glare. 

Will leaned across the table, pressing a finger gently between his eyes. “Explain, Jacob.”

Jake’s gaze flicked to him, clinical, sharp, and strangely alive with both excitement and fear. “What else do we transport that’s not patients?”

I knew the answer before Will could open his mouth. 

Something, like a spider’s leg, crawled down my spine. 

“Organs,” I said to an empty table. 

I had been staring at Olivia’s wide, searching eyes, her parted lips looking for an answer. 

Then, without a word, she flashed out of existence. 

I shook my head, blinking rapidly. I turned to the others, meeting dead air. 

The three of them were gone.

My pager buzzed: Code Blue. Floor 3. ICU. 

My stomach dropped, adrenaline spiking, muscles tensing for fight or flight. 

I could hear the soft patter of nurses rushing by, alarms shrieking from upstairs, but I couldn’t move. The door slammed open. Dr. Harley’s head appeared. “Dr. Marks, we need you in the ICU. Code Blue.”

I followed him, tripping over myself as we dashed up the stairs.

There was already a congregation of staff outside the closed door. “It’s our R1s,” Dr. Harley told me, pushing through the crowd. 

“They’ve flatlined.” His voice splintered. “We’re doing everything we can, but it’s serious.”

I stopped dead. Somehow, I reached out and grabbed him, yanking him back.

“They’re brain dead,” I whispered. “If you declared them brain dead, why are you trying to save them?”

“She’s right.” Jake appeared in front of him, arms folded, a faint, feathered glow outlining him. 

Jake stepped close, until the two were nose to nose. “We’re brain dead.” He stated. “Why *are* you trying to save us?” 

Dr. Harley turned to me, lips curling into a practiced smile. 

He yanked me away from the crowd, his fingernails digging into my skin. 

“Stop talking,” he hissed under his breath. 

“Do your job, and keep your mouth shut.” His eyes were hollow, like staring into twin stars. “Do you understand me?”

""Yes,"" I whispered, ignoring the ghost's rolled eyes.

“Stay here,” Dr. Harley snapped at me, shoving me back before forcing his way into the room.

Jake stayed with me, avoiding my gaze. 

He stared down at his feet for way too long, before it hit me. He was dead.

“Will and Olivia?” I spoke under my breath.

He exhaled. “Saying goodbye to their parents.

He slumped to the floor, his sigh breaking into another sob. 

Jake surprised me with a wet, shaky sob. “Do you know what my biggest first-world problem was before I died?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 

“I liked someone who didn’t like me back,"" Jake hummed, smiling. ""And for a moment I actually wished I were fucking dead.” 

I didn't expect him to break.

It was real vulnerability, real emotion. Pulling his knees to his chest, Jake hid his face. “My dad’s not coming, and my mom only agreed to take me off oxygen so she could fly back to Australia. Will and Olivia died with their families around them.” 

He gave a sharp, humorless laugh. “I died alone.”

I sank down beside him, fighting the urge to give an awkward pat to the air between us.

“Then why…” I started, trailing off. 

“Why are we still here?” He let his head flop onto my shoulder. Jake was comfortably warm. “Beats me.”

The two of us sat in peaceful silence, and I revelled in his ability to accept the inevitable. Dr. Harley stepped out of the room eventually, his eyes visibly red.

“Crocodile tears,” Jake muttered.

“Dr. Matthews, Faraway, and Carlisle have passed,” he said quietly. “They’ve called it.”

I stepped into the room, and Jake followed reluctantly, sticking close to my side. 

Will and Olivia stood by their empty beds, arms wrapped tightly around each other. 

After a moment, Jake moved toward them, slowly, like he was fighting against his own emotions, before he gave in, pulling the two into a hug and burying his head in Will’s chest.

My legs somehow worked, and I stepped outside.

I figured I would leave them alone. 

They were going to disappear soon, and I was not ready for that kind of goodbye. 

I barely knew them, yet somehow they felt closer than friends. 

Their presence had been better than that of any colleague I had at my old job. 

I went back to work, ignoring whispers among the patients of the R1's deaths. 

I glimpsed Will sitting with one of the cancer patients, a terminally ill five-year-old. 

The child was talking animatedly, and Will had a book open on his lap. He shot me a grin, and I managed one back.

“Have you seen Liv?” He called over, turning a page.

Instead of responding, I shook my head. 

My night shift flew by, and before I knew it, the sun was rising. 

Which was crazy because I felt like I'd lived a lifetime. 

Two surgeries and three kids almost flatlining. 

Will flashed in and out of my perception. 

Sometimes he was doing cartwheels to make the little kids laugh, and then he was nowhere to be seen, leaving his little fans restless. 

By the time I dived onto the temporary bed in the residents lounge, I was ready to sleep and never wake up.

“Hey.” 

Someone had other plans, a certain ghost hovering over me with boundary issues.

His breath prickled the back of my neck. 

I didn’t move, burying my head in warm pillows. “Go away.”

“Grace,” Jake prodded my cheek.

I hissed, pulling the blankets over myself. “Can you take your paranormal melodrama somewhere else and let me *sleep*?”

He withdrew his finger. “Someone’s cranky.”

“I’ve been up all night,” I mumbled. “Why are you still here?”

Jake sighed and, to my surprise, flopped down beside me. “No idea. Will seems pretty happy we’re not fading away. He’s spending time with the kids.”

“And you?” My eyes were already drooping, but  my heart was flipping over in my chest. Jake’s expression was surprisingly soft. And I wasn't used to soft.  

His half lidded eyes held mine and he shifted closer. So close, I could count each individual freckle on his nose. “What are you going to do?”

Jake froze when we were nose to nose, before rolling into his back. “Oh. Yeah, no. I'm not into that.” 

I retracted, a wave of heat spreading across my cheeks. “Into what?”

His lips curved into an uncharacteristic grin. “You seriously want to fuck a ghost?” He raised an eyebrow. “Is that even anatomically possible?” 

Jake’s gaze drifted to the ceiling. “If I were alive, yeah, I’d probably have shameless sex with someone I’ve known for barely a day. Sure.” His lips twisted into a smirk. 

“Hell, I’d probably cheat after a few days and fuck an older nurse anyway.”

“Can I ask you a question?” I asked. 

His smile was unexpectedly warm. “Sure.” 

“Before you died,” I said. “Did you often get punched in the face?” 

Jake didn't seem to find the funny side, and curled up. “I’m going to sleep. I don’t feel great.”

His words jolted me to a sitting position. “Meaning?”

“Meaning I don’t feel great,” he groaned. “What else?”

Then he sat up suddenly, eyes blinking open. “Where’s Olivia?” 

“Dr. Marks.”

I hadn’t realized the door was open. My head snapped towards the threshold. Dr. Harley stood looking bewildered. His eyes were still noticeably red from crying. “Who are you talking to?”

Jake shot me a sidelong glance. “Connor’s going to tell everyone you see dead people,” he muttered. 

“I remember when I started, he claimed I left a scalpel inside a patient. I had to prove I wasn’t incompetent. I almost lost my job.” His eyes narrowed. “He bullied Will for weeks just for calling him out during surgery. Don’t trust this asshole.” 

“Grace,” Dr. Harley said, his brows furrowed. He noticed me tossing glances at the empty space next to me. “Are you doing okay?”

While I fumbled for an excuse, the man sighed. “Go home. It’s been a long shift. Get some rest, all right?” 

His gaze lingered on the spot where Jake sat before he turned off the light and left the room.

“Olivia,” Jake said, diving off the bed. “Where is she?”

I followed him out the door—or through the door—in his case. “I haven’t seen her since you guys—”

Jake’s pace quickened, his doctor’s coat swishing behind him.

Dr. Jacob Faraway wasn’t dodging the House allegations.

“Since we flatlined,” he said, passing straight through a patient. “So, she’s moved on? Seen the light?”

I passed a nurse who gave me a tired smile. I nodded back and reminded myself to keep my voice low. “So, where exactly are we going?” I whispered.

Jake broke into a run. “She’s probably with her body.”

We took the stairs down to the morgue, slipping through the door. 

I had to steady myself before stepping inside. 

I was a nurse. 

I knew bodies, insides, the wiggly bits of human anatomy. 

What I didn’t know was how to grieve. How to come face to face with their bodies. 

I froze on the threshold as Jake staggered back, his eyes wide and wild. 

Jake dropped to his knees, heaving. 

“Don’t.” He wiped his mouth. “Don’t fucking go in there.” His voice broke around the words, and something cold, something slimy, slid down my spine. “Please.”

Ignoring him, I pushed my way in.

Blinding light slammed into my eyes. 

A surgical table. Metal instruments gleaming. Several masked doctors clustered around a body. 

I saw the limp hand, the restraints pinning down the limbs, the halo of dark brown curls spread across the clinical silver. 

It didn’t click. 

Not until a raw cry curled in my throat. 

Not until I saw the hollowed-out torso of a body splayed across sterile steel. 

Her lungs were visibly protruding through the thoracic cavity, while the stomach and kidneys had been carefully excised and placed in a sterile container.  

But her body was still moving, lungs still inflating, eyelids flickering. Olivia was still alive. 

“Dr. Marks.”

Lan, the lead surgeon, frowned at me behind his mask. “Please wear appropriate attire when observing a surgery.” 

His gaze flicked back to Olivia. “Is the patient’s heart ready for excision?”

“Where am *I*?” Jake broke down behind me. I didn't realize he'd followed me. 

His wild eyes found mine. “I remember what happened. We were transporting living patients for organ removal. When we realized, Will tried to—” he trailed off, his lips curling into a monstrous snarl.  

“That bastard attacked and knocked us out.”

He lunged forward, a whirlwind sending instruments  clattering across the floor. 

Bewildered doctors stumbled away from Olivia’s body.

Jake collapsed into sobs. “If I'm alive, where am I?” He wailed. “Where's Will?” 

Lan ignored the commotion. 

His gaze flicked to me. “Dr. Marks, this is standard procedure.” He gestured to Olivia’s body. 

“We’re keeping this confidential, but we are experiencing an organ shortage. Nobody is willing to donate, so do it ourselves. With ICU patients, we mimic a flatline and transport those viable for procurement.” 

His lips pinched into a smile behind his mask, when Jake let out a raw shriek, and sent scalpels flying. 

“Do not be concerned,” Lan said, his gloved hands coated in blood. “Dr. Carlisle remains fully conscious and responsive. Her awareness constitutes informed consent for complete organ procurement.” 

His gaze landed *on* Jake, a subtle, triumphant expression crossing his face. 

This was not standard protocol. 

This was shutting them up.

1p2j3bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/inflation/comments/1p2j3bi/curious_about_us_cost_of_living_heres_what_things/,Curious about U.S. cost of living — here’s what things cost in Germany for comparison,"Hi, I’m Tobi from Germany and I keep seeing videos about how expensive the cost of living in the U.S. has become. I’m having a hard time imagining what day-to-day expenses actually look like, so I thought I’d share what things cost where I live and see how that compares.

For context: groceries in Germany are pretty cheap compared to other European countries. Based on my experience, Austria and France are roughly 30% more expensive. Countries like Croatia, even though average wages are much lower, have similar food prices to us.

We basically have four major supermarket chains: REWE/Penny, Edeka/Netto, Lidl/Kaufland, and Aldi (split into Aldi North and Aldi South). They compete heavily, and in towns of around 10,000 people you usually have at least three of them. There used to be more supermarket brands, but most were bought out due to price competition. Walmart also tried entering the German market years ago but couldn’t keep up. Aside from a few regional stores, these chains dominate.

Lidl and Aldi are also successful internationally and considered discount stores abroad, while REWE and Edeka offer a wider selection but have roughly the same prices for basic items.

Here are some typical grocery prices where I live (using €1 ≈ $1.10, just approximate, not current exchange rate):

1 liter milk → about €1 (≈ $1.10)

18 eggs → €3.29 (≈ $3.60)

1 kg ground beef (2.2 lbs) → €10–12 (≈ $11–13)

500g coffee (1.1 lbs) → about €7 now (≈ $7.70), used to be €4 (≈ $4.40) a year ago

1 kg bread (2.2 lbs) → €1.80–2.50 (≈ $2.00–2.75)


Prices have gone up about 20% since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Monthly income after taxes and social security health insurance included (just to give some context):

Minimum wage: about €1400 (≈ $1540)

I’m a nurse: around €3000 (≈ $3300)

Tradespeople: about €2500 (≈ $2750)

Industrial workers: €3000–4500 (≈ $3300–4950)

Teachers: €3500–4000 (≈ $3850–4400)

Doctors in hospitals: €4000–7000 (≈ $4400–7700)


How does that compare to where you live in the U.S.? What do you typically pay for groceries like milk, eggs, bread, or ground beef? And what’s a realistic take-home salary for similar jobs?",16,1763682277.0,inflation,9,1.0,False

You can read more about the system I was implying here - [https://adlandingpro.com/blog/fill-your-culver-city-coffee-shop-in-30-days-or-less/](https://adlandingpro.com/blog/fill-your-culver-city-coffee-shop-in-30-days-or-less/)

Just to cover a few key points - 

**1. The problem isn’t baristas — it’s the system.**  
The workers were hustling. The long wait wasn’t caused by “slow staff,” but by **mobile order spikes**, understaffing, and workflow overload.

**2. Mobile order** ***sorting*** **exists — but load balancing does NOT.**  
People mentioned Starbucks already prioritizes cafe and drive-thru over mobile.  
That’s true, but it doesn’t fix the core issue:

>

Right now, baristas get **5–10 tickets in seconds.**  
That’s the bottleneck.

**3. Baristas confirmed the exact issues I described.**  
Multiple partners said:

* “We get order waterfalls constantly.”
* “Extra tasks (cup writing, stickers, app requirements) slow everything down.”
* “We’re understaffed for the mobile volume the app pushes.”

These are exactly the friction points I wrote about from the customer side.

  
**4. The tweak I suggested was simple: presence-aware priority + better flow timing.**  
Not replacing your system.  
Not telling baristas how to work.  
Just:

* easing mobile spikes
* preventing order dumps
* matching timing to actual staffing
* recognizing real presence in-store
* balancing volume waves instead of letting them crash

This type of logic doesn’t exist in the current system.

**5. The post supported baristas and the strike movement.**  
Nothing in the post attacked workers.  
Everything in the post pointed to:

* understaffing
* pressured labor
* unrealistic demand volume
* the exact issues driving current Starbucks worker actions (Red Cup Rebellion / “No Contract, No Coffee”)

**6. The deletion only validated the conversation.**  
The original post was removed from r/Starbucks within 15 minutes —  
even though:

* it wasn’t negative
* it wasn’t hostile
* it supported workers
* it proposed thoughtful improvements
* baristas were actively adding insight

I’ve been living in a rented apartment that had a Delonghi Essenza Mini and now that I’m moving out I want to finally buy my own machine. I really enjoy Nespresso coffee and would appreciate some advice on what machine to pick.

These are my current options:

- Delonghi Essenza Mini 70€ and includes 50 pods in that price

- Krups Essenza Mini 77€...design looks a bit nicer to me but no pods are included

- Inissia 60€

- Pixie 90€

- CitiZ 95€

All of them also include a 40€ voucher at Nespresso store.

I’m not sure if the upgrade to Pixie or CitiZ is worth it, or if I should just go for the Essenza Mini again? Especially since the Delonghi deal includes 50 pods...what would you recommend? Is there any real difference between the models except the size and design?

1p2iyva,https://www.reddit.com/r/clozapine/comments/1p2iyva/sleep_issue/,Sleep issue,"My girlfriend has schizophrenia, she was on clozapine for over 4 years at 300mg and it worked well for her. The only issue however is she has sleep issues because of it. She sleeps 12+ hours a night but also can’t help but fall asleep randomly throughout the day sometimes for an hour or several hours. She is unable to drive long distances as she has had issues getting sleepy at wheel. A drive that’s less than 20 mins she can handle but longer drives it becomes a problem. 

She has tried several medications instead of clozapine because the sleep issue has prevented her from being able to work for years. She recently got out on cobenfy (which was a train wreck because doctor absolutely neglected telling her it’s not an antipsychotic and made no safety plan for the med change, and knew the meds weren’t working and she was hallucinating and failed to do anything to help, instead she put her on a mood stabilizer for no reason.) anyways it resulted in her going into psychosis and going into a hospital. She then got out on invega which worked enough to get her out of the hospital but she for months hasn’t been herself, has no emotions, hears voices all day long still, and has side effects that are health issues from it. So we got her to get back on clozapine. Right now she’s on 100mg about to go to 150mg but of course, soon as she starting taking the clozapine again the sleep issue came back. 

Does anyone else experience this issue, especially to this extent? Is there any way to resolve this or at least make it better for her? It is hard on her to be stuck with only this medicine working for her schizophrenia but leaving her incapable of working, caring for herself, or doing much at all. 

Her doctor has tried her on an adhd med to try and keep her awake after her 12+ hours of sleep but that did nothing. Her new doctor tried Wellbutrin to keep her up in morning but still no change. We’ve tried coffees and other caffeine stuff to try and keep her awake but has zero effect. 

Is this just how it is? I just want to help as I know she feels like she’s no help and useless because I have to work to take care of both of us and I don’t make much, and I have to cook and clean majority of the time which I’ll do it if I have to because she can’t help how the meds affect her, but I want her to have a better quality of life than this. Even if we can’t fix it anything useful for helping her quality of life would be greatly appreciated :)",1,1763681946.0,clozapine,2,1.0,False

1p2iykn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p2iykn/a_brief_history_of_why_nothing_matters_chapter_1/,A Brief History of Why Nothing Matters - Chapter 1: China Kitty,"I am the whisper in your ear that begs you to jump at the edge of a cliff. I am the invisible thing that holds you down in dreams, paralyzing you, making you carry that hesitation to every important decision in the waking world that you have failed at. I am the reason sex was called sodomy. I am the foreign language you beg for your life in, right before some boy from a richer country guns you down. I am the fucked and broken feeling you have as you stare at the void, knowing you are absolutely worthless. 

Infinity means nothing without its zeroes. And you shitty fleshy cousins of walking fish ARE zeroes. All I had to do was give you a couple nudges in the right direction to make your life a sad and self-poisoning, pointless misery. Sometimes I don’t have to work. Sometimes I get to sit back and laugh as you beg a God for things, setting yourself up for cosmic disappointment. I eat that shit up like metaphysical popcorn. Watching you blame yourselves, scouring your life for a misdirection, trying to figure out when you sinned, grasping desperately at straws to find why your daddy in the sky won’t give you everything you want. I am your loss of faith, your diatribe about floating rocks and being a monkey on it. I am the first time you hear of the heat death of the universe, not that your civilization will survive to see that anyway.

I am the connection you make about the sexual proclivities of your politicians and billionaires, that click of your synapses when a conspiracy stops being a theory. I am that helpless feeling that you got to inherit a world pre-ruined for you. I am the black nihilism that allows degenerates to make a living making jokes about how doomed humanity really is, or hours of content complaining, spreading hopelessness like a virus. I love to watch you losers pat yourselves on the back, creating fake titles to prove how you are so intellectual, as you turn genocide, suicide, and mass violation into something small and digestible for your little academic papers. I am philosophy, a way to obscure and systematize your misery, taking you so deep inside yourself that you don’t realize you have long ago internalized that disappointment is everything life has to offer.  

You, who are well read, will recognize what I have known all along. The term “death of the author”. I find that term cute and endearing, like the way you’ll label whisked cream as Cool Whip. For you, it is the death of the narrative, a realization that life is not a story; you have no arc, and you will die with many questions unanswered. I am that brief moment of panic when you see there is no light at the end of the tunnel, but your body has already given up too much to bring you back.

In your own terms, I’m best understood as the “view from nowhere”, the ivory tower academics muse and pretend to know things in, a lame exchange for living off food stamps and wet dreams about their undergrads. 

Would you believe, in all my acidity, that I do have favorite stories from whatever presumed legacy you, as a stain, leave behind? I am a collector of these murky chronicles, and you, my lucky audience, will receive the gift of my retellings. I’m sure you can tell, I am highly selfish, so you may be asking why I would care to show you these rarities. As your species grows in number, you’ve taken all the fun out of watching you. You no longer believe in magic, the stars, or Allah. You have created a non-stop marathon of self-deprecation about being doomed, and in perfect human fashion, you’ve lost your reasons for it. You feel sad merely because it’s comfortable, with no urge to escape.

I am bored of you, and lately your stories have been redundant and inadequately mystical. Through these vignettes, I will provide an addendum to that little whisper the next time you find yourself at the ledge of some fourth-story building, holding off only because you wanted your death to be from higher up, more of a spectacle. I want you to remember these and hold off thinking, “at least that didn’t happen to me.” I want to give you a false promise that things could be worse. I want you to see your misery through, to have hope, so I can crush you again. I want you for a brief glimpse to think that it will get better as I pull you in and slip the painful blade of truth in-between your ribs. Because I can promise you, it only gets so much worse. 

**China Kitty**

“*Hi Angel, I visited your grave again today. I brought a mix of Carnations and Dahlias, though you would have smacked me over the head for the clash of the colors. It was a light rain, one of those mid-November fogs that we would have spent splitting a j by the open window with a book and a sketchpad. I miss you every day, Kathleen. Sometimes I catch a whiff of your cheap patchouli roll-on perfume drifting past me as I’m making coffee. I see you with muddy clay-covered hands as you smiled up at me from behind the banding wheel, making a mug or a modern statue of Venus. I remember your soft exhales as you looked up at the ceiling on top of me, your stifled whispers of ecstasy as we tried not to wake your roommates up. I wish I could’ve given you that baby. I wish I hadn’t fought you so hard over us working in coffee shops and restaurants, barely making enough to pay for our own food. I would have quit smoking, and we’d have an extra 15 dollars every other day to spend on a thrifted rain jacket or little red boots as we walked on either side of a small miracle we made, with its hand wrapped around a finger or two on the way to a park or a trail. I remember how you cried as I tried to push you away for so long, you begging me to stop being such a coward, saying that we might never find a love like this again. Your big doe eyes welled with tears as I held you and ran my fingers through your hair, trying with more effort than I’d ever put into school to not lift up your bangs. You always hated that. I will always love you, and I will see you again, Kitty. Please don’t be disappointed if I show up gray and old.*

*Happy Birthday Angel,*

*Yours Forever,*

*--*	*Wiley”*

The thin and ratty blond boy delicately placed his handwritten letter between a marble vase and a gravestone in a small spot shaded by a tree in hopes it wouldn’t get wet. He laid the floral arrangement down and picked it up again, trying out several places and things to leave it next to. He chose to put them front and center, surrounded by candles burned until the wick was no more, and trinkets her family had left behind. There was a Radiohead mixtape she made for a boy she liked in high school, a small clay worm with a face from 2nd grade, and a copy of *Valley of the Dolls*  which they thought was still her favorite book. Last was a Polaroid of their dog Monty, swollen and turning pink. It had been a rainy week. Wiley took a deep breath through his nose, kissed his index and middle finger, and placed them softly on the top of her grave, the rough beveling a cold reminder that’s the closest he’d ever get to grazing her soft skin, which would stay oddly warm even when it snowed, again. He hated goodbyes. They seemed to never end with this girl. He laughed at that thought. Even in death, she pushed him out of his comfort zone. 

He turned away quickly, trying to wipe that lonely thought from his mind. He tried to imagine he was visiting someone else, that she’d be at home, not defrosting the chicken. And it was okay because he wanted Halal from the corner for dinner instead. They’d say over spilled saffron rice that THIS was going to be the last time they eat out until the next paycheck, like, for real this time. 30 minutes later, they’d go out for ice cream or a chocolate croissant. No. It’s best to be a realist. He’d stopped the magical thinking about 6 months after she died. There were only so many flies around the house that he could say were her teasing him from the great beyond. There were only so many times he could be glued to his phone before his eyes drifted to the time, seeing a 4:44 or some other angel number. She loved those small moments when there was something else out there, something she didn’t know enough to be cynical about. Wiley’s therapist told him in many flowery and college-educated words that he had to drop those little comforting lies–  that was the first step to letting her go. His eyes stung as he walked away, and his face felt wet. He thought, of course it’s wet, it’s raining. 

Kathleen Flores’ grave lay at the back of Hartford Cemetery, a collection of grassy hills so big it seemed a miracle anyone could find their way around. During his walks back to the front gate, which divided the gravel parking lot from rotting bodies who’d had their cars sold or gifted, Wiley liked to unfocus his eyes and pretend he did not exist. He pressed fast-forward in his head, trudging through the mud, *squelch squelch squelch*. His Doc Martens sank into the earth, and he pulled them out like a suction cup holder from the wall, a cheapskate attempt at a DIY coat rack. He stepped into a puddle that was deeper than expected, and the water splashed up onto his belly, bringing him back to the present. His eyes focused, surrounded by unfamiliar headstones, way older than he was used to seeing on his walk back. He was lost. He looked at the trees; moss grows…North? He didn’t know if the entrance was North or not. He followed the moss, tracing his hands along the bark, cursing himself that he had to spend any longer around reminders that she was gone. Then, he started running. At first, what is referred to as a “White Person Jog” before breaking into a sprint. His lungs burned; he completely ignored his lack of athleticism, balance, or spatial coherence, with only one thought: *out! Out! OUT!*

Wiley tried to unfocus his eyes before feeling his left leg sink deeper than his right, halting his momentum and throwing him face-first into wet black mulch. He had dirty water in his contacts; the irony that his eyes *really* couldn’t focus now was not lost on him. He pushed himself off the ground, feeling something, probably a rock, poke into his palm. It supported his weight for a moment before a hollow cracking sound as the rock gave out and pierced his hand. “FUUUUUCKKKK bro.” He yelled and thought, “Surprise! Today sucks.” The warm liquid pooled in his hand as he realized he was rubbing nasty skeleton people dirt into an open wound.

 He had never crushed a rock before. He had never even tried. He looked down at his palm to see an explosion of tiny white splinters, some watercolored, some with thin gold lines gleaming a pale yellow hue, before bright blood swallowed up his view of his maimed hand. He made his wrist limp and flailed his hand around before picking out as many lacquered shards as he could see. He looked down to observe the point of impact. Lying at his feet was a constellation of what looked like…. A broken plate? No, too many of the pieces were contorted with too many smooth and winding edges. The largest piece still intact was staring up at him. Big watercolor pupils, a pink nose, and a wide “W” of a mouth. He would have laughed if it weren't such a sick joke. In his blind fumbling, he had crushed a small porcelain statue of a housecat. He tried to surmise his surroundings. The 1 and a ½ foot deep boot-shaped imprint he had made kept a small rock with text too weathered to read at its head. His heart sank, the consequences of his clumsiness setting in. He had sunk into a burial plot and destroyed the only gift left to commemorate whoever rested here. 

His first thought was not his best thought. “Ok, maybe everyone who remembers this lady is dead too.” He slapped his hand to his face. This person was someone’s Kathleen once. Maybe they still are. Maybe she hated flowers because of her allergy to pollen, and her one true passion was collecting fine china. That seemed infinitely more benign than the pile of black Santas collecting dust in his Aunt’s living room. He wanted to fix this, and for a brief moment, a magical thought crept back into his mind. “It’s what Kathleen would’ve wanted.” He pocketed as many shards as he could find. As he zipped his jacket pocket up, he felt the rain begin to slow. In the distance, he saw a tall angel statue that he recognized. He started towards it before an odd hollow entered his chest. There was a fluttery jerk echoing through his sternum, before he swallowed the fear into a stomach clenching in on itself until it felt like a taut piece of rubber. He chalked it up to his immune system recognizing the coming infection. He dry swallowed an Ativan on the drive home anyway.

Before returning home, he stopped at Café le Lit, which used to be a home away from home for him. These days, he only stopped in on special occasions. He zipped up his windbreaker to conceal the massive mud stain on his shirt and hoped anyone could believe the stains on his jeans were from some type of manual labor. He traveled past the decorated bookshelves to the back, where the pastry line was. He put in his order, keeping his bloodied hand in the empty pocket, and paid the 12 dollars for his dirty chai and chocolate croissant. Money was so much less important these days. 

As he grabbed his order, he felt a tightening in his forearm flexor. He was walking toward the door when it twitched again, closing tightly around the paper cup. The lid gave out with a small pop, and the freshly steamed milk flooded his closed fist and trickled down into his jacket sleeve. As he hopped from one leg to the other, he tried and failed to reopen his fist. He rushed out with his face on fire, so embarrassed that he didn’t notice the display of vintage postcards he’d knocked to the ground. “I’m useless without you, Kitty” played over and over in his head. Please don’t let me be useless without you.

He drove home in silence as the rain began again. There was that feeling. Was it panic? He tried to cross his stiff fingers and prayed it was a mid-20s heart attack. No such luck.

When he got back to his apartment, he took off all his clothes and cried in the shower. He let the water run over his raw and torn-up hand as it continued to ooze blood and now, pus. He tried to drip his 3-in-1 body wash into the gash, only to jump at his own guttural shriek. He squawked in pain, laying his face against cool tile, looking for any sensation to distract him. He felt a bulge he hadn’t noticed traveling deeper into his hand, beginning to hit muscle. Then, a whisper: *Grab it.*

There were two large slits in his right hand, close enough to agitate each other when he extended his fingers, and a small island of flesh lay in between them. He wrenched his left hand into a claw with his teeth, and he guided it with his elbow into the bigger slit. He felt the ends of the slit stretch and split a little. It was too late now to turn back. He ground his teeth, contracting his temporomandibular joint so hard he thought his teeth would crack against each other. He tried not to pass out or throw up, knowing that if bile landed inside of it, he’d have to take himself to urgent care. He clenched harder as stomach acid and barely digested pâte feuillete with chocolate swirls made their way through the gaps in his teeth before he swallowed again. The Ativan residue was bitter going down again. He felt the bump under a small pile of tissue. He reached deeper, grimacing; It’s almost over, it’s almost out. He found a fold in the muscle he could reach through and felt a little porcelain oval. It was deeper than he thought it was. He dug deeper, trying his best not to pluck the thin tubes he assumed were arteries. The whisper came again, *PULL PULL*, but he was in too much pain for any sort of language to register. As he groped around, he felt the back of his cuticle graze something hard and textured, almost slimy. He had found his way to his tendons. In an instant, he thought of every animal he had torn apart, his canines shredding their joints before his bicuspids ground them to a paste. He thought of cheap Pho, a watery broth that softened bones over the course of twelve hours or more. He thought of his father's brisket, trapped in a slow cooker overnight, slowly disintegrating the muscle fibers that had held the cow’s chest intact in life. Meat, he told himself, it’s just meat. And for an odd moment, he felt a grumble in his stomach. *Hungry, you are hungry.* The bitter paste of his failing benzo reached the back of his tongue. 

Pain is really just a series of electrical zaps traveling through your nervous system, he chanted, and tried his best to turn it off. The blood pooled and pooled, as he became cold and woozy. He couldn’t believe he had this much blood to spare. He watched his bathroom get darker. Had someone turned the lights off? Just when he thought this was how he would go out, and that his landlord would find his dead and soiled body, wrinkly like a raisin, he slipped his fingers under the porcelain bulb. He tried, with as much precision as he could muster, to push it back through the tendons and muscle. It snagged God knows what on its way back out. He heard the whisper again, a woman’s voice. *In you, I am in you now.* He let his fingers close around the bulb to pull it through the palmar fascia, into the epidermis. The tight ball his fingers were in was much bigger now that they held his buried treasure. The gripped porcelain ball expanded the split, ripping further up his hand, nearing his wrist. He tried to uncurl his fingers in an attempt to remove the smooth ball externally, but they were frozen in place once again. Finally, his fingers were outside of his wound once again, and as he forced the object out of his grip, he was able to see what it was. Lying on his shower tiles was a small porcelain paw, intact with a clean break at its wrist. He took a final glance at his wound, poking his tongue out. Animals are supposed to lick their wounds, right? He swatted the thought away before rushing out of the shower. 

Rummaging through the first aid kit, hardly used, sitting in the bottom shelf of a moldy vanity someone had left on their porch step, he began to hyperventilate, looking for something to stop the bleeding. Among several boxes of naloxone (not that they had ever been used, but it felt like the 40-dollar thought that counts) was a tube of Neosporin that he promptly emptied into his wound. The blood trailed like rivers around a cloudy delta of antibacterial sludge into the first aid kit, staining loose tablets of Benadryl and Zyrtec. Kathleen’s old inhaler, which she covered with Lisa Frank stickers, gazed up at him, begging to be useful one more time. It was probably expired by now. He stuffed the edges of cotton pads into the slits, not thinking about the loose hairs he’d have to pull out of his hand once the blood and plasma crusted over. He wrapped every piece of gauze he could find as tightly as he could around his throbbing wound and then applied several layers of duct tape for good measure.  He raided an empty fridge and pantry for anything to raise his blood sugar, but only found old ketchup packets. They popped in his mouth like a juice-filled gummy. He spat the empty packet on the ground, and they came out with a shard of enamel. Dizzy, he stumbled to his bed pale and naked, and used the last bit of energy he had left to pop another Ativan before he lost consciousness. As his field of vision grew dark, he felt a hot and rotten air fall on his face like a homeless mouthbreather was nose-to-nose on top of him. His final effort was to try not to retch at the smell; the only thing worse than dying in the shower is drowning naked in a puddle of your own vomit.

With a good deal of work, Wiley forced his eyelids apart, cracking the seal of mucus that had crusted over in his sleep. It was dark outside. He was spooning his windbreaker, with his wounded hand no longer bleeding but not without leaving a dry brown hickey on his bedsheets. His left hand had loosened a little, enough to be considered a claw. He sat up and reached for the light switch.  There were several little clicks, but the room stayed dark. He thought, “My retarded landlord blew a fuse.” He threw his head back and bonked it against the wall. Kathleen hated it when he said gay or retarded, except after a couple of glasses of wine, when it was the funniest thing in the world to her. She’d tipsily complain about her day, her burnout coworkers, and would cock her eyebrow when she talked about an especially rude customer. That was his cue to call them retarded. 

Sweeping his feet off the bed and onto the floor, he felt soft fur slip between his legs but heard no steps and saw no movement in the dark. He returned to the vanity to collect some boxers, and with some luck, dignity, when he saw a shadow pass by his window. As he dropped his legs into the waistband and through the plaid polyester sleeves, he started to place himself a little better. People were still walking outside, so it couldn’t have been that late. When he looked back up at the mirror, he saw the shadow again, now still. It had gone from the left side to the center, blocking the main source of outside light, and painted a more defined outline of his observer. It couldn’t have been the same person; it seemed nearly a foot taller. Unless it had come closer? 

Wiley shuddered, thinking some old perv had been taking pictures of him splayed out and naked. He tried to say fuck off, but a lump of mucus must have hardened his sleep, so it came out as a sad gurgle. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth, determined to be intimidating this time, but watched as the figure’s chin extended, hollowing out its cheeks. Its mouth was open too. Maybe it would say something? Maybe it was a misunderstanding, and they felt like a total creep? Maybe it wasn’t a pervy old man but a 22-year-old bombshell who was a little weird about sexual boundaries, but was hot enough to look past that. Not that it mattered anyway. He hadn’t been able to get hard since Kathleen had passed, except for what he called a “tasteful” Polaroid. He had taken it when they were still in college. Trapped in the thermal paper, she tucked her chin into her collarbone, her big nose (which he loved) poking past her fried platinum hair, grinning as if she was shy, but obviously in complete control of him. He couldn’t do anything about it either because if he looked at it too long, he started to cry. 

The figure continued to stare back at him, both of their mouths agape, waiting for the other to say something. Just as he started to string the words “What the fuck is going on?” together, it began to lift its arms from its hips to its shoulders, extending its wingspan fully. Wiley noticed a couple of things as it moved jerkily. The figure was a woman, thin and malnourished, to the point where her hip bones poked further out than her thighs. Her long, slender arms, which must have reached past her knees at rest, lifted; her torso and chest became more defined. Despite being thin enough to be the victim of years of human rights violations, her breasts sagged wide and low, areolas pointed straight down, attached to nipples that looked like droplets of wax about to fall. It was just as Wiley thought, this lady couldn’t get any further from a hot girl that his eyes fell downward. In between the spindly tubes that had to have been legs, he saw a long, overgrown bush. It looked like it was wet and dripping. 

 

“What the fuuuuuuuuck…. What the fuck is happening right now?”. Whatever mental patient had fallen off the transport bus was naked outside of his window. Its fingers had sprouts growing out from under its fingernails, like seeds had taken root and began to reach towards light. There was a soft *clunk* as it pressed its forehead against the glass and swung its chin like a pendulum back and forth. There was a rubbery squeak as Wiley realized it was dragging its tongue across his window. The grotesque figure rested its entire weight, which could not have been more than 85 lbs, onto one hip and he watched as she rotated her spine around her pelvis in a painfully slow orbit. It sucked its torso in, revealing a ribcage so prominent that it might as well have had gills. And when she pushed it back out, her diaphragm filled with air, making her swollen as if she had a beer belly. 

The whisper came again, as if it were right behind him. *Run boy run.* His legs trembled as his shoulders turned, buckling as his center of gravity traveled faster than his feet, and he landed on fully extended arms. He felt two cracks at once, the crack of the scab on his right palm and an instant depressurization as pus flowed out. The other was a tight and dainty *krrrriick* after a short bend of his left thumb bent backward past 90 degrees, then 120, and kept going until it was a useless floppy sausage that swayed around, slapping against the back of his hand. Now on his knees, Wiley tried to bring himself to his feet without putting any weight on his hands. He flexed his lower back, bringing his head up as if he were doing a perverted version of an Islamic Isha. He hopped up onto the balls of his feet and felt the plantar wart he’d been ignoring outside of bored experiments with nail clippers. He pressed his foot down with so much force that he felt the small clump of HPV ridden skin all the way to the root. As he fumbled through the darkness in pain, he became increasingly aware of his poorly cared-for body giving out on him. Isn’t fight or flight supposed to do the opposite? With another step, he heard a third and final firecracker chain of little snaps as he stepped on his windbreaker pocket, the remaining pieces of the feline statue breaking into too many pieces to count. He felt the pieces slice through the poorly insulated layers and into his foot. *Inside you, I am Inside you.* 

Limping now, Wiley made his way into the living room, where a familiar electric whine and uneven *whirrr* grabbed his attention. The banding wheel. Wasn’t the power supposed to be out? He tried to fumble to the kitchen past the laundry room (it was a miracle that it came with the apartment) to the front door. As he plopped his bleeding foot on the floor as quickly as he could, he felt thin fibers penetrate and enter the lacerations in his foot. He thought, “There is no way my floor is this dirty”. The thin beam of light that broke through from underneath his front door divided into three pieces. Someone was at the door. He screamed, “HELP,” hoping that it was anyone other than whatever was outside of his window. He knew it wasn’t. The fibers clumped together, tangling into a ball. Cat hair. *Inside you, I am inside you.* Wiley tried to walk faster toward the front door, both his feet becoming wet. He heard a sad drawl from behind him, “*Wiiiiiiiileeeeyyyy, is that you?*” He felt dry crumbles break under his feet, then a thin, wet slippery layer that nearly threw him down onto the soft wet grass below him. When did he get outside? He trailed deeper into the hallway, passing the door to the laundry again and again. Mud rubbed into his feet, entering him and hardening. *Inside you, I am inside you.* In between slipping around and landing on the drywall, he almost said, “Kitty, did you leave the lazy suzan on again?” He didn't know it was called a banding wheel until after she died. She’d only done so once, but the rotational force of the small mass of clay on the wheel she had left on flung into a bucket of water, spilling across the floor, seeping mud into the cracks in the floorboards.

The chill of the night air lapped at his face like a whip. He’d been walking down this hall for so long that he wasn’t sure of where he was anymore. He fell to his knees, screaming at the sky, “I’M SORRY, OKAY? PLEASE LET ME FIX IT. LET ME FIX IT”. Silence. “I DIDN’T MEAN IT, OKAY? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.” Silence. His jeans became cold and wet at the knees again, sinking into the mulch. Tears streamed down his face. Was it raining? He couldn’t be sure. It had been a rainy week. At least, he thought so. Is it still November? Are you blowing out your candles in heaven, Kitty? Is James Dean trying to take you to bed? Can it really be heaven without me? “Let me fix it. Please, God, please let me fix it.” Silence. And then a whisper. 

*Inside you. I am inside you.* Wiley reached into the pocket of his shitty windbreaker as it spurted blood. He reached past the epidermis, slipping through the palmar fascia. It was warm, much warmer than his shitty jacket had ever been before. He forced his fingers past the palmar flexor sheath, paying no mind to the way the tendons contorted around his fingers. His claw traveled downwards, ripping the thick layer of skin that separated the two gashes. They traveled into the wrist, and he pulled, trying to find every shard of porcelain left inside of him. He widened the slit with his fingers, exposing the small, pumping red and blue tubes in his arm. He ripped them free, letting his warm blood sink into the earth. The stone in front of him was too weathered to read. He licked the dirt out of each beveled letter. He felt he was losing too much blood and grabbed at the loose mulch on the surface of the empty plot, stuffing it under his skin. “See, you’re inside me! Does that make you happy? Do I still make you happy?” Silence. His stiff, half-curved fist was the perfect gardening shovel for him to dig himself deeper into the ground. Once he had dug past the snail shells and earthworms, into the rock below, he lay down in bed naked again, sobbing. 

“See, I’m inside you too?” 

Silence. It wasn’t supposed to come out as a question. 

“Can I still make you happy, Kitty?”

Silence. 

“Please let me fix it. I didn’t mean it. It was an accident.”

Silence. Then the whine of the banding wheel.

“I didn’t mean it, Kitty. I’m sorry, please let me fix it.”

Silence. 

Wiley screamed until he couldn’t anymore, then whispered until his voice box gave out, left to chew on silent words, the dry clack of his tongue separating from the roof of his mouth, only to slap it again. Inside you, I’m inside you again, Kitty. Does this make you happy, Kitty? Did I make you happy?

Silence. 

I could have done so much better, Kitty. Please let me fix it.

Silence. 

Please let me fix it, Kitty. I take it all back.

Silence. 

As Wiley felt his vision blur, he let his eyes close. Happy Birthday, Kitty. I’m coming back for you. 

Silence. 

Wiley felt his face grow cold, and his body stopped fighting as he clutched his windbreaker so close that its zipper broke his skin. He covered his face with it and took a deep sniff; it still smelled like patchouli.",3,1763681923.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I sighed as I closed my eyes, rubbing my temples. The Federation summit Venlil Prime was hosting was going as it usually did, many ambassadors getting near blackout drunk and trashing on everyone else. The Kolshian and Farsul ambassadors were busy with family matters, so they could not attend. I heard the familiar pitter patter of my daughter and smiled, opening my eyes to see her running at me, biggest smile on her face, my husband following her. ""MOMMY!"" she screeched, jumping onto me with a tight embrace, hugging me as tight as I hugged her, my husband nuzzling my face, receiving his own nuzzle back as he sat next to me, chuckling. ""She did good on her report card and wanted to use her reward points to see you *and* get a Mazic figure. She's obsessed with them, I'm telling you."" He said in a amused way, my ears flicking in dismissivness. ""Bah, she'll be fine. Who doesn't like the Mazics? They are very blunt and straightforward, and are very loyal to friends and loved ones."" I said, making my daughter giggle when I tickled her.

The Mazic ambassador, Cupo, strolled over, flaring his trunk in greeting, my tail doing a greeting motion back. My daughter gasped and her tail wagged with excitement, ears twitching. ""Can I ride on your back, mister Mazic?"" She asked, making my husband's and my features straighten in alarm and embarrassment. This earned an amused and surprised look from the Mazic, who looked at my bouncing bundle of joy, then to me. ""Your daughter is very energetic, ambassador Tarva."" He said in a flat tone, but his eyes lit up with more amusement as my daughter held up the Mazic figurine, her own joy very apparent. He wrapped his trunk around her and placed her on his back, my daughter making satisfied bleats as soon as she was settled. I walked with Cupo as he let my daughter view everything from so high up. He eventually set her back into my arms with a satisfied look. ""I haven't let anyone ride my back since my children grew too old to be carried. Keep safe, Tarva."" Said the Mazic ambassador, the large mammal strolling out the building. I sighed deeply and looked down at... wait... where was...

*Date, Standardized Terran Time; December 24th, 2078, 12:18 PM USEST*

I shot up into a sitting position with a sharp gasp, taking a moment to settle my heart and breathing. I looked at the face-down picture on my nightstand, not wanting to look at the happy photo of my daughter. I grabbed my holopad and try and call my husband, only to receive no service. I toss my device weakly, seeing someone in my peripheral vision. I turn slightly to get a better look, seeing the predator i had collapsed on sleeping soundly near me. I get up and sneak past him and into the hallway, keeping a brisk step as I try and find General Kam, seeing predator soldiers nearly everywhere. I finally spot him conversing with what appeared to be an officer, both holding mugs of some sort of black liquid. I hesitantly move toward them, Kam spotting me and rushing over. ""Tarva! Thank the void you are alright. You were out for two whole days."" He said, my snout catching a whiff of the bitter smelling liquid in Kam's hand. I turned my nose away, Kam gulping down the rest of it before sitting me down. ""The Axur are leaving. Thier final push failed and now they have to retreat or they would have no more ground forces. Signal will be restored shortly, so you can call your husband."" He said reassuringly, making me look at the predatory Officer he was conversing with, the man nodding in affirmation.

I nodded slowly, crossing my arms. ""Good. Also... who was that... soldier that caught me and was guarding me?"" I asked, Kam clearing his throat. ""A Human Corporal named Noah Williams. He felt responsible for your wellbeing after you collapsed on him."" He said, making my tail swish once behind me in confusion... at least, I thought it was confusion because he began to elaborate. ""He just wanted to make sure you didn't have complications is all."" He said quickly, making me cock my head before shrugging, sighing. ""Is the city safe?"" I asked making him shift. ""Yes, but the citizens are running away from any Human or Terminator they see. We are trying to get a casualty count in total, and our guests are being a real help moving the debris and regular clean up."" Kam commented, the streaks of the last Axur shuttles streaking up towards the sky. I felt like a great weight was lifted off my shoulders as the last of the Axur began to depart, a slow swaying of my tail signifying my relief. The Human Noah walked out of my room with a yawn, stretching his predator body, cracking his bones as he bend his back. I looked away when he yawned, catching a glimpse of his fangs. I did notice that he only had four, two on top and below, but i didn't want to look a predator in the mouth, even if he did care for me. He did hand me my holopad in passing. ""You left this in there, Governor."" He said groggily, moving to drink that black liquid many humans seemed to revere.

I grabbed it hesitantly, watching for signals connection. Once there was i immediately called my husband, Torzil. He picked up immediately, rhe sounds of a raid bunker blasting through the speakers. ""Tarva! Thank goodness, you're alive. Why didn't you get to a bunker? I've been trying to contact the one in Dayside, but i haven't been able to get through."" He said, voice full of peril and worry. *'Considering the bunker here was likley burnt out or destroyed... or both, so it makes sense.'* I thought before giving a grateful ear flick. ""I'm happy you're okay, too, Torzil. The Axur are leaving, so it should be safe to leave the bunkers, but I'll give the all clear once they leave the system."" I say, my husband of nearly 12 years nodding affirmitavely. ""Good, good... listen, when I get back up, we need to talk."" He said cautiously, my ears twitching slightly as I knew immediately what he meant. ""There's nothing to talk about. We will bury our daughter, and that is that.we don't need a life celebration."" I said, which cause him to look down. ""Not what I meant."" He said slowly, almost whispering. ""I... hope you'll understand later, and forgive me."" He said, hanging up just as another Venlil began to approach him frkm behind in the video. My hands shook as I understood. I dropped my holopad, the humans and Kam shifting uncomfortably. ""Shit..."" one commented. ""Fuck... that's gonna suck, big time..."" another said, casting his gaze away. Noah looked at me with worry, his sleep having been shaken off. Kam attempted to touch me, but I scooted away, making the man nodding solemnly, understanding i needed space, despite it being against greater societal norms.

I closed my eyes and fought back tears, sighing sharply as I understood why he did what he did. I knew he cheated, it was evident with the female Venlil coming up behind him and his words, but it didn't hurt less. My daughter was dead, now my husband was leaving? It was hard not to just collapse and just bawl, but I needed to be brave and push past it. Perhaps I could fully forgive him, but I'd likley never see him again after the divorce. I was strangely fine with it, honestly. I did notice a rift forming between us for a while as I became more ambitious and shot for Governor. I don't quite think he liked the idea of being in the public eye all the time, in addition to trying for a simple life.

I noticed the humans begin decorating a few places with brightly colored rolls of paper and such, brightness out hastily wrapped gifts from packs and coats, laying them under... impromptu trees? I recognized it as some sort of holiday tradition and looked to Kam for confirmation. He sighed and shrugged. ""Human holiday similar to [*error, translation not found. Closest approx;* **Grain Giving Day**] called Christmas. They give each other a multitude of different trinkets, food, clothes, and other stuff. Supposedly a fat human man in a red suit delivers presents to all the people of Earth, but it is otherwise a time of giving, good fortune, and joy."" He said, the humans having excited conversations about it. From their speech and way they idolized the holiday, it was one of the few things these beings looked forward to, which said a lot, considering they were fighting monstrous machines that looked like them. I decided to walk up to Noah, the man downing yet another cup of the bitter liquid that didn't really smell appealing. He bared his teeth and I jumped back, the Human putting up his hands. ""Woah! Relax, it's a show of happiness. When humans frown or bear our teeth, *that's* a threat display, not smiling."" He said, doing the motions repeatedly while naming them to show me. I slowly made my way over and looked at the back liquid, flicking an ear in curiosity. ""Oh, that's coffee. It's a bean drink that holds the drug called caffeine, makes many humans energized. It's harmless in most cases, the most damage it causing being yellow stained teeth and some heart problems. It's best drank in moderation, like most drugs."" He explained, my hands reaching for the pot and a mug once hearing it helped Humans stay awake. Noah helped pour me a mug, giving it to me, being careful not to touch me. It was strange, sure, but a predator looking out for my needs made me feel good. 

I turned my attention to the tree and the presents, and smiled. The Venlil would like this holiday, especially if these nice Predators began giving things to them to help them. Maybe it might not go over well initially, but I knew my people could enjoy the predators' company.",8,1763681512.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

And to be real instant isn't hitting for me I was planning to buy a machine before the new job but now im getting desperate for decent coffee.

SO together we have $1500 Australian dollars to spend. I like steamed milk drinks he likes Long black and espresso shots so a steam wand is necessary and a water pour is desired. I have previously done a Barista course so some manual control is fine.

Both of us will drink at least 2 to 3 cups per day each and we have people round a couple time per week so that's maybe a few more on those days.

I have Looked at the Breville Bambino plus and the Dual Boiler but I am certainly open to suggestions also will likely need to get a grinder.

Were in Sydney and i have found a deal on the Bambino and a Breville grinder for only a touch more than our budget we can be a little flexible.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

(even though this post doesn’t look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  🖤

a little about me! 🦭
- im usually online a lot, especially during the mornings in which I don’t have work but in the afternoon I will be online all of the time, i use other apps as my main methods of communication!
-i have a job as a cook, i work in a kitchen making food and whatnot so i won’t always be online 24/7 but i like to make time for people that are important! like those who like to communicate and interact 
- i love animals, especially seals! a few that I like are puffins, cats, and birds!
- im usually a very passive person who doesn’t like to initiate any sort of conflict. im not a very competitive person, i like to have fun generally! i have a lot of emotions and i like to use them for the greatest, and I like to dwell on what i am feeling most of the time instead of taking it out on something else, i like to talk about my emotions though sometimes i feel like i have a hard time expressing them, not just to myself but to other people. if you’re the type of person who is going through something, id love to listen and hear your thoughts!
- i like to party up with a few friends of mine most of the time and talk about video games and such, connecting with others and building friendships are one of the things that are the most important to me!
- if it’s okay I’d only like to share photos of me upon request! i have a somewhat skinny build and i am 6’ tall, with short-medium brown hair

things i love to do! 
- one of my favorite things to do is to write, and if you like to write too then we will get along well! i write a lot about characters from video games, sometimes from movies too. i like to be inspired by video games or movies or books and media to come up with stories for characters, i love to make lore about headcanons for characters like from some of the games down below. maybe we can share some stories of ours and write something together? 
-i love to RP! have been for around 4 years now, can go up from just a few paragraphs to full novella! ties in with my love for writing and love to create characters and headcanons 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!
- i love energy drinks and collect the cans as well! i also like coffee as well, a pretty tame alternative
- i love sharing memes and videos and such that i find funny, usually skits or edits!
- i like movies! probably my favorite movie of all time is tron!
i like music, I listen to bands like jungle, joywave, daft punk, and modjo 

that pretty much sums it up so if you want to send me a chat or dm feel free to message me! i can give you my socials as well! id love to hear from you!

It's taking longer for me to get turned on during sex and even after I am my natural lubrication is way less than it used to be and still thin and watery. 

My scent has changed as well and that may be because I basically wear panty liners all day when I'm out and about because it's so...*wet* constantly and literally soaks through my underwear. The only time I don't is when I'm at home, I take everything off but my pants (I don't live alone so I have to wear something lol) to try and let it air out as much as possible. 

I only use CeraVe body soap because I have sensitive skin and everything I use like lotions, laundry soap is all unscented. I shower every other day or else my skin is a desert. I drink mainly water, coffee once a day, energy drinks occasionally. Nothing really stands out that I'm doing to cause this. 

My fwb I've been with for 5 years has never mentioned me smelling bad, though I *have* to shower downstairs at the minimum every time even if I had a shower already earlier in the day because I'm scared of the odor. 

I've always had a naturally stronger scent, which I know is normal but now it's like  *so* strong. It's the worst after my period has ended which is now when I'm posting this been 2 days since it's stopped and it's just so strong like I can't tell if it's my new normal or what. It's very hard to describe, definitely not fishy, kinda acidic but not? Ugh. 


I tried to find information online of what's normal for a 30 year old vagina lol but everything mentions childbirth and I never have so ??? 


Every time I got to the gyno for something I feel is wrong they tell me I'm fine and I'm hit with a $300 ultrasound bill and still struggling with whatever is the problem. So I basically never go to the doctor as I never get any real help or information.

Proud of myself today!! But also need to realise this is and should be the bare minimum and I still have work to do on my portions! I *nearly* made it to the full energy goal, I think? But I am most proud as I stuck to the plan I made and didn't freak despite bloating, fullness, constipation etc! I had a REALLY good conversation with my dietician she reviewed my intake over the past few days, and then reviewed my plan for the next week. She was not too happy I was back at work (but saw heard how happy it made me). She reminded me most people at my BMI stay in hospital until they get to at least 17.5. 

I then explained my symptoms recently (dizziness, constipation, fullness, nausea, digestion issues), I was proud of myself for being open and she was quite concerned, she said she thinks I've actually lost weight in the past two weeks given my activity (from my job and steps) and my reduced intake. She thinks the scales are probably maintaining because I am constipated. 

Either way she approved of my plan and agreed I need to increase despite fullness etc. She said 2600 should be my goal (particularly because of work) but she doesn't want me to obsess over energy and reminded me all calories are good calories. She also reassured me it's okay to have 'an extra dessert' she said really having ice cream and a flapjack is one dessert - like you'd have cake and custard or cake and cream.

I decided as well to move back in with dad, just to have a little more support as I push up my intake. It also makes sure my activity doesn't get anymore than it already is. Because even in the two days I was away I noticed some old habits creeping in. Thoughts are now loud tonight (too much sugar, too unhealthy - the usual shit), the constipation is awful but my dietician assumes it’s from my lower intake and said I just need to keep eating! I am feeling really determined after today! I have shown myself I can stick to my plan I just need to be strict on myself and be careful of undercutting- this was I can hopefully meet my energy over the next few days! Hope you all are well!

Obligatory English is not my first language

Originally wrote this on 06/30/2024:

For context, I (female) am on my early 20s, my teacher (male) is on his late 30s early 40s

I'm on my final year of university and, to graduate, I must complete two semesters of internships. During the intership, the students are assigned two supervisors, one is the direct boss of their position and the other is a teacher from the faculty, both overviewing the progress of the student during the internship.

Turns out, I've never met the teacher that was assigned to me until the beginning of the year (March). He's been recently appointed as a professor in an introductory class for first-year students.

The first time we made contact he phone called me and introduced himself, and I was kinda pissed that he didn't even send an email or something. But we later met by videocall and fuck, this man was WAY younger than I thought. He literally looks like Will Schuester from Glee.

After that meeting, we agreed to do the next meeting in person. He prompted to do the meeting in a cafe next to the campus, which I found suspicious (because I thought we would be meeting on his office) and told my psychologist about it, but as long as he didn't do anything inappropriate, it should be good. I later found out he does not have an office in my faculty, so we actually didn't have another choice.

The day of the meeting we talked about us, our personal lives, without too much detail. I also had to do a presentation for him as homework about the things I did during my first weeks on my internship. When the meeting ended, he paid for everything. Mind you, I was really hungry because I had lunch early, and I got a drink and some food, but I thought that I was paying for my things, so it took me by surprise when he paid for both of us. He also drove me to my bus stop that evening.

This became regular over the pass of the weeks. We meet almost every week in a cafe to talk about my internship, I show him the assignments he sends to me to do, and he pays for everything.

I have a classmate that has this same teacher as her supervisor, but I don't know if he treats her the same way. I haven't asked her yet. One time we went all three to a coffee shop together along a former student of his, and also paid for everything, which actually lowered my suspicions.

I've heard that my other classmates' supervisors are awful, ignoring their mails, being rude or not even helping on emergencies. Others are just average, they just do their work. They don't take their students to a coffee together.
This teacher has been nothing but a sweetheart to us. He has told us a lot of times that he's available for any need we could have. I also have learnt a lot about my career, and more about the area where I'm doing my internship. I didn't like my current area until last year, but now I want to work on this.

A teacher should be like this, I guess. But most of my teachers are straight assholes. 

Now, to the main point.

Around two weeks ago, we met as usual in a coffee shop next to the faculty. During this meeting, I told him that I got a diagnosis recently. He asked me if I wanted to accompany him to the faculty because he was about to give a class, so I said yes. He presented me to his students, and got me to participate in the class too. He also teased me when I received an email from work, meaning that I had tons of job to do over the weekend.

I think everything was ""normal"" until a few days ago.
We met again in a coffee in the city. We talked more about how's been everything lately. I confided in him some important things about my mental health. He reviewed my progress of the final report I have to submit at the end of my internship, corrected some things, paid for the coffees and we left.

We were talking about mundane things, walking through the city, and even though I should have walked back to the campus, I decided I wanted to accompany him to his destiny (which was still a few streets away to the campus entrance). I told him more about my personal life. At first, I was reclutant to share details about myself. But now that we've been meeting regularly, I guess I trust him more.

I left him were he had to go, said goodbyes, and left. And I realized that something's happening to me. Every week I look forward to our meetings because it makes me feel good to even hang out with him. 

I don't know what to do. I don't think I can't do anything about it either. 

I think I should talk to my psychologist about this, but I don't know what else to do. I feel kinda lost.
I guess I'm feeling different (and catching feelings) because he is a decent human being.

He hasn't made any inappropriate advances towards me, or, at least, I haven't noticed any at all.


Situation that triggered everything (11/20/2025):  I talked with my friends a week ago about the situation (randomly, because of a meme) and they told me that I was likely groomed.

Visualize anything with Nano Banana Pro","**\[TL;DR\]** Google launched Gemini 3 Pro Image (nicknamed Nano Banana Pro). It fixes the three biggest AI art headaches: it renders perfect text, it allows character consistency across 5 different people using 14 reference images, and it uses Google Search to fact-check visual elements. It's available now in Gemini Advanced and AI Studio. Full guide below. Also, it can create 4K images and very cool infographics.

Google just quietly dropped **Gemini 3 Pro Image**, but the community is already dubbing it **Nano Banana Pro** (just go with it). If you work in creative, marketing, or design, you need to stop scrolling and pay attention.

I've spent the last 24 hours stressing this model, and it is a significant leap forward. Here is the breakdown of why this matters, how to use it, and the prompts you need to try.

# 🍌 What makes Nano Banana different?

**1. RIP ""Alphabet Soup"" (Text is fixed)** We all know the pain of generating a great poster only for the text to look like alien hieroglyphics. Nano Banana Pro actually understands typography.

* **The Upgrade:** It handles multiple fonts, long phrases, and complex layouts without hallucinating spelling errors.
* **Use Case:** UI mockups, movie posters, logo concepts, and merchandise designs.

**2. The Holy Grail: Consistency & Blending** This is the killer feature. You can upload up to **14 reference images** to guide the generation.

* **The Upgrade:** It can maintain visual consistency for up to **5 distinct characters** in a single scene.
* **Why it matters:** You can take a sketch of a product and turn it photorealistic while keeping the *exact* shape. You can storyboard a comic where the main character actually looks the same in every panel.

**3. Grounded in Reality (Google Search Integration)** Most models hallucinate facts. Nano Banana taps into Google Search Knowledge Graph.

* **The Upgrade:** If you ask for a ""1960s Ford Mustang engine bay,"" it knows what that actually looks like based on real data, rather than guessing.

# Top Use Cases & Prompt Examples

Here are three workflows I’ve successfully tested.

# 1. The Brand Consistent Social Post

*Stop generating random generic images. Force the AI to use your brand colors and font style.*

**Prompt:** ""Create a flat-lay Instagram photo for a coffee brand. **Reference Images:** \[Uploaded Brand Color Palette\] + \[Uploaded Logo File\]. **Subject:** A latte art in a ceramic cup on a wooden table. **Text:** The text 'Good Morning' appears in the foam in a cursive style. **Style:** Minimalist, warm lighting, high contrast. Ensure the color palette matches the provided reference.""

# 2. The Product Mockup (Sketch to Real)

*Turn a napkin doodle into a client presentation.*

**Prompt:** ""Transform this sketch into a high-fidelity product photograph. **Reference Image:** \[Rough sketch of a futuristic chair\]. **Material:** Matte black plastic and walnut wood legs. **Lighting:** Studio lighting, soft shadows, neutral grey background. **Text:** Place the word 'AERO' on the backrest in gold embossed letters.""

# 3. The Educational Infographic (Search Grounded)

*Leverage the Google Search integration.*

**Prompt:** ""Create a visual cross-section of a DSLR camera. **Grounding:** Use Google Search to verify the internal placement of the mirror, sensor, and prism. **Labels:** Clearly label the 'Pentaprism', 'Reflex Mirror', and 'Image Sensor' with pointer lines. **Style:** Technical vector illustration, clean lines, blue and white color scheme.""

# Pro Tips for Best Results

* **Text Containers:** When asking for text, describe *where* it should go. Don't just say ""add text."" Say ""The text 'Sale' is written on a red hangtag attached to the handle.""
* **Reference Weighting:** In AI Studio, you can actually weigh your reference images. If you want the structure of Image A but the style of Image B, lower the influence slider on Image B slightly.
* **Iterate on Composition:** Since consistency is high, you can generate a character, like the look, and then say ""Keep the character exactly the same, but move the camera angle to a bird's-eye view.""

1p2i3o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loblawsisoutofcontrol/comments/1p2i3o5/latest_sdm_scam/,Latest SDM Scam,"I happened to run out of my ground coffee today and thought, great, this is the 20% senior's discount day at Shopper's Drug Mart (every Thursday). Perfect timing, I'll pick some while I'm there. I find it on the shelf - it's $30.99 which is outrageous and the most expensive I've seen it anywhere, ever. But no worries, I'll get it for $24.80 with the discount because I'm old.

At the till, it comes to $29.99. Why? Because, they say, it's already on sale so the senior discount doesn't apply.

So I look through their weekly flyer. It's not part of the weekly sale. So it's a local store ""special"" (or maybe chain wide, I dunno). The ""sale"" seems to be ""take $1.00 off so we don't have to give you $6.00 off"".

What a load of shite.

The only reason I ever shop there is for the senior discount, which is substantial when they don't play gouge-thy-neighbours.

Needless to say I left it there. Luckily there's a No Frills down the road. Same coffee on sale there this week is $22.99. Even their regular price $29.00 beats the in-store ""special"" at SDM. Unbelievable.",83,1763679739.0,loblawsisoutofcontrol,31,0.92,False

- I do NOT like to be moved or carried for any reason. (I will give you an ugly look if you try.)
- I am able to smell and hear things at a great distance (e.g. I know when my parents have arrived at my daycare even before they've walked into the facility.)
- Before arthritis, I was a very fast runner and a high jumper. (I was really good at fetch.)
- I keep watch of my property. I will sniff the perimeter of my yard everyday to see who has been by. 
- I keep watch of my humans. I must know what they are doing. But I will choose a comfy couch over being near them. 
- I do not like the rain. I do not like getting wet, and thunder is frightening. 
- I do not like tall grass. I will pee on concrete before I squat in tall grass. 
- I do not howl, I whistle and shake when I am excited. 
- I like to make comfy forts. Give me pillows. Give me blankets. 
- I love to chew bones. I always know where I leave my bones -- all 4 of them -- and I like to leave each one in a different room. 
- I like to stare at my parents while they are reading. 
- I give lots of licks. 
- I really love coffee. Sometimes my mom forgets that she left a coffee cup on the table, and I will find a way to tip it over and drink what's left. 
- If I'm feeling angry or agitated at my parents, I will go through the trash. I won't even feel bad about it. (I had a brother once who often took the blame because he was a softie, but I do not apologize for anything.) 
- I love a good walk, especially somewhere I've never been to before. 
- When riding in the car, I like to stick my head out of the window so that I can sniff everything that goes by. ",0,1763679694.0,MbtiTypeMe,7,0.5,False

I don’t know about you, but I have been finding myself desiring connection and support. 
My ultimate goal is to springboard off of Reddit and out into the world where we can meet up to support one another whether that be in a small group at a coffee shop, over drinks, or even on a hike, I’m open to all of it! 
In terms of location, this group would have events generally in the Raleigh area however it would be awesome to plan outings in Charlotte, Asheville, and anywhere else that strikes our fancy.
