They gave it to me for a benign tremor in my face but it ended up being my wonder drug. I can't explain what it did to my brain other than it made me feel the way I imagine normal functioning adults feel. Everything was clearer, I tackled daily tasks with ease, I was able to PLAN stuff. The fog was lifted. It was great, i wasnt afraid of making phone calls, a lot of things that scared me no longer did when i was on gabapentin. I ended up needing more over time, stupidly I went up on my dose on my own 3 extra pills a day by the time i ""told on myself"". I Think it's important to know that I was also newly sober and people were feeding me bs like ""caffeine is a drug, you shouldnt even drink coffee."" SO naturally  I felt guilty. for one, for being on something that made me so happy and took away so much of my fear! I felt like if something WORKED for me and made me feel good and happy (and the fact that I went up on it by myself) MUST mean that I'm addicted to it and abusing it.  So I told my Doctor I was abusing it and that I never wanted to be on it again,  and now when I go into the Doctor it says I have a Gabapentin allergy and to never give it to me. it sucks I have not been the same since quitting it and I just really miss it.

1hw9cjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanresidents/comments/1hw9cjj/lonely_in_japan_or_anywhere/,Lonely in Japan or anywhere,"For context, I‚Äôm m37 living in Tokyo for 8 years. I keep seeing people post about their loneliness or having difficulties finding friends in Japan. The comments are often ""go to meet ups or do a pottery class"", but I think this kind of problem deserves a longer answer. So I wrote down my two cents this morning.

I hope you're all doing good.¬†

Finding real friends can be as hard as finding a romantic partner in my opinion.

It‚Äôs easy to have a coffee with almost anyone and have a decent time, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a friendship. Friendship, to me, goes much deeper and it starts with myself.

I think to be a good friend or partner is to really know yourself. For me, that took work. I had to look at parts of myself that I didn‚Äôt necessarily like and learn to accept them and embrace the parts of me that I like.¬†

One big thing I realized was that many of the things I loved as a kid weren‚Äôt just phases. They were things I‚Äôm still deeply fascinated by and reconnecting with those hobbies and interests helped me feel more comfortable with myself.¬†

That lead me to be okay with being alone. In the past I went to meetups hoping to make connections, but I‚Äôd often leave feeling even lonelier. It felt like no one really knew what they were looking for‚Äîlike the blind leading the blind. Eventually, I started to enjoy being by myself.¬†

In my opinion, being alone isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It gave me time to do things I love and learn more about myself, leading me to new interests.¬†

I also learned that it is very crucial being open about what I enjoy to others. Whether it‚Äôs on social media, chatting with coworkers, or talking to new people, sharing my interest is the best and probably most straightforward way to find actual friends. All the people I now call close friends came into my life through shared interests.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about how hard it is to make friends in Japan, but I think this isn‚Äôt just a Japan problem. It is hard everywhere. But if you take the time to know yourself, enjoy your own company, and share the things you‚Äôre passionate about, you‚Äôre much more likely to find the kind of people that will matter to you.

I stopped eating gluten about a year ago.

I was super nervous for the procedure, but it was very easy. Wanted to share my experience for anyone with an upcoming endoscopy that‚Äôs nervously scouring Reddit for info like I was. I have pretty bad health anxiety, so my doctor used propofol and I was walking into the procedure room and wheeling out of recovery within the same hour.

Wanted to see what everyone else's credit card rotation looked like, and why you keep each card in your rotation (the benefit you like of it - doesn't have to be points or cash back, could be things like free roadside assistance with TD Visa Infinite's card, no FX fees, etc.)

Thanks in advance for sharing!



My rotation, not interested in churning, and I collect both points and cash back 

**1. Rogers WE** \- 3% cash back on everything when applied to phone bill (including Costco, and when combined with Exec membership Costco cash back increases to 5%), 3% cash back on USD online shopping

**2. Canadian Tire Triangle WE** \- 1% in CT money on bill payments that typically don't accept credit cards (like utilities), plus free roadside assistance

**3. AMEX Cobalt** \- 5x points or \~5% cash back when redeemed for statement balance on eating out, use this for all coffee/restaurant expenses

**4. Scotiabank Visa Infinite** \- 4% cash back on groceries and recurring bills (max out the Rogers WE cash back benefit against phone bill so needed a secondary grocery card, plus 1% higher cash back on non-Costco grocery)

However, they basically say it‚Äôs odd and weird to not want to stay with my parents and save up money. And that I seem rude and self centered for coming home and then just go low contact after I leave. 

They still think it‚Äôs good to have a plan to be independent but they think I‚Äôm being crazy about leaving my parents. And I just can‚Äôt ever really explain why I don‚Äôt like them because I know if I explain my past I‚Äôll either be trauma dumping, or they‚Äôll literally never believe me and assume I‚Äôm dramatizing/imagining my past.

(Okay?, I'm literally just ordering black coffee)

I usually order the same thing, but sometimes i do have variants of coffee i decide to choose from, but its usually black coffee.

I asked her for a blank black coffee, and while preparing it, she asked for my name. She mentioned that she sees me often, ordering the same thing, yet I always seem unsure....

In my head, I was like WTF, why would she feel comfortable saying that to me, I'm not fat, short, I was wearing a gym tank top that showcased my broad shoulders.... How dare she say something like that to me... the nerve of her... (my ego)

I responded jokily, and told her i have anxiety, and not everyone is built the same. She told me to practice. She used her body language to demonstrate speaking with more assertion.

Its just so fucking weird that someone would point that out to me....

I told her i appreciate it, and i left. All the while i was very upset.

I felt offended by her remarks, as they hit my self-esteem, despite my efforts to improve my social skills. As a man with Asperger's, I often face assumptions about my confidence and abilities. Her comment made me feel inadequate, especially since men are expected to be assertive. I wish people would stop making quick judgments based on limited interactions.

Do women make backhanded compliments as a way to flirt? She had no right to criticize how I communicated my order. Luckily, she criticized me when it was slow, with no other patrons inside witness the interaction. She said it in a friendly way... like she was trying to dominate me. I

Today, i seen her, and she asked me about how my day was trying to make small talk. I just usually respond with one word answers. Small talk isn't my strongest skill lol

I don't know how to interpret this interaction. I'm quite confused, and humiliated by her critique of my social skills. As if im not adequate enough, as if i had lost a physical fight.

TLDR: Barista made a comment about my social skills, alluding that I should sound more assertive when ordering coffee. Not sure if it's flirting or a backhanded compliment; either way, I feel like my manhood has been disrespected.",1,1736302645.0,intj,4,0.67,False

I have developed a student diet that gives me the lean build, and energy I need to thrive as a student in our desperate era. This is my guide to beauty maxxing in your diet. 

  
Let me explain...

  
Every morning I have a cup of coffee from k-cups I purchase that provide me a substance of energy / caffeine to get me through a majority of my day. Along with that I typically make a protein based oatmeal using water \*not\* dairy. I mix in veggies between grapes, bananas, kiwis, avocados, etc., and this makes for a perfectionate breakfast and routine. 

IMPORTANT: I eat breakfast standing up or crouching, to follow my routine you cannot be sitting! You must be multitasking, I do NOT take breaks, always be on the grind!

  
Lunch is a hot mess due to my intense schedule and grindset, but in order to maintain and continue growing out my intense intimidating body building routine I need to keep eating lunch, I cannot sacrifice the calories. I typically put a can of tuna, sardines, or other fish in my bag along with my fish oil to get a good source of omega-3s on the go, to improve cardiovascular health, and that of my brain power. I can also be found sometimes with rice I make the day before, it is a good source of calories, and carbs. This gives me a healthy, and nutritious lunch. 

  
Dinner has never been much of a problem, I always make a meal between chicken, salmon, and steak, depending on the day of the week. I always buy various veggies and fruits placing it on my plate. As a student you do not have time for complex meals and simplicity is the best choice. I often times use spare money to buy Chinese, Thai, and Korean foods whenever money permits, as they are typically cheap and healthy alternatives to a good diet over fast food junk that damages the skin, and kills the body along with its energy. 

  
IMPORTANT: Never do late night snacks, they hurt your morning energy, and promote unhealthy weight gain! Eat a good meal at dinner, and sleep it off till your morning dinner. Aim for 3 complete meals, and carry water with you throughout the day. Avoid excessive caffeine, and sugary drinks. ",0,1736302438.0,uofm,3,0.23,False

1hw8pkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hw8pkg/i_hope_vr_delivers_more_coop_experiences_my/,I hope VR delivers more co-op experiences (my thoughts on Into Black),"VR needs more of this. 

Been playing Dungeons of Eternity with my wife for months, and while it is fun we def prefer story driven games. Before VR we played games like Dead Space 3, Borderlands, Dying Light., etc. If a game has a story and has co-op we are all about it.

We've played about 4 hours of Into Black so far and it's so damn cool. First off it's a very clean looking game. The graphics have that Borderlands/Deep Rock Galactic style and it works well. It's not a highly detailed game but that's understandable as the environments are pretty large for a VR title and there is zero loading along the way. 

Gameplay feels great. It's easy to switch between the laser to collect minerals or a gun to take on some pesty space bugs. It's never frustrating. The low gravity jumping is relaxing too.

One of our favorite aspects of the game is that there is \*some\* kind of story actually happening. You are stranded, you gotta figure it out, and the only help you have is a floating AI unit that was originally programmed to basically get you coffee. 

Bottom line is I wish there were more co-op experiences in VR. We are still rocking Quest 2 headsets and no lie the main reason we haven't upgraded to Quest 3 is it's just hard to justify without more experiences catered to what we want.

Alien and Batman look great, but until we see more co-op games announced for the platform I'm not sure when we will BOTH upgrade. I say both because I would likely upgrade on my own at some point as I do use the headset for SP games and other things, but I'm in no hurry. Don't want to leave the wife behind but she pretty much only likes to play VR with me, and if there aren't many co-op games she loses interest :(

Peter Dutton is no genius (‚ÄúThere‚Äôs genius in this nuclear plan‚Äù, 7/1). He has no viable climate change policy. Nor does he have a viable energy policy. There‚Äôs a good reason why nuclear power plants are sited on rivers or on the coast; they require large volumes of cold water. French nuclear power plants sometimes have to be shut down because of drought, a risk that is much greater for Australia.
Nuclear power is old technology, just a method of boiling water. Renewable energy requires no water to run, and is new technology. Old technology isn‚Äôt best ‚Äì if it were we‚Äôd still have VHS tapes and CDs for music.
Peter Dutton could actually bring a lump of uranium safely into Parliament. It decays by emitting low energy alpha particles that are stopped by several centimetres of air. Alpha particles aren‚Äôt hazardous unless you drink Putin brand polonium-210 flavoured tea.
Wayne Robinson, Kingsley

A nuclear charade
Christopher Pyne may be right that there is genius in Dutton‚Äôs nuclear plan (‚ÄúDutton‚Äôs nuclear plan will never happen, but it‚Äôs still a gem of a policy‚Äù, 7/1) and appears correct that attitudes towards nuclear have, in general, likely shifted with the change in generations.
It‚Äôs such a pity that the genius that Pyne writes about, is political genius. Pyne says nothing about whether it is good policy and writes that time will tell whether Chris Bowen can make Labor‚Äôs economic case stick. Surely the conversation should concentrate on whether the policy makes sense. Otherwise, nuclear energy is simply a charade, which Pyne, in a sense, intimates.
Jon Aloni, Bentleigh

Opportunity wasted
Christopher Pyne argues that Dutton‚Äôs nuclear power policy will help the Coalition to win the next election. However, this dubious proposition is a mere distraction from the main point.
That main point being, that Dutton‚Äôs nuclear option ‚Äì advanced in the face of Australia‚Äôs enormous advantages and opportunities in the area of providing cheap and clean renewable energy and thus helping to ensure a sustainable future for humanity ‚Äì is barking mad.
Colin Smith, Glen Waverley

Safe, for how long?
Unlike Christopher Pyne, I know lots of under-40s who think that nuclear power poses a real danger. Danger of delays and huge costs, of escalating climate crisis in the meantime. And ‚Äúsafe‚Äù nuclear power relies on a lack of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, to say nothing of war and malicious intent, or even just incompetence ‚Äì and we have seen all of these around the world in nuclear disasters, or near disasters.
Critically, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù nuclear power relies on regulations free of corruption, influence or political power plays ‚Äì now and for thousands of years.
Elizabeth Manning, Highton

Loading
Leaky proposal
If evidence were needed to convince anyone that Dutton‚Äôs (nuclear) bucket has not one hole, but several holes in it, Pyne spells them out: new regulations, new powers, new structures requiring parliamentary approval both federal and state, no states with Coalition majority, no guarantee of even Coalition state government acquiescence. No problem, says Pyne. The bucket only has to hold water until the election cycle ticks over.
John Gare, Kew East

What would Coalition really do?
Christopher Pyne praises Peter Dutton for managing to persuade the sceptics in the Coalition to finally accept the science of climate change. He also acknowledges that Dutton‚Äôs nuclear plan will never happen. This raises the million-dollar question. If the Coalition wins government, and given its antipathy to renewable energy, what exactly will it do about climate change? Our children and grandchildren would love to know.
Tim Douglas, Blairgowrie
THE FORUM
A nuclear fantasy
Christopher Pyne eloquently tells us what many of us already know: Peter Dutton is not serious about nuclear, he has simply used it as a tool. As Nationals senator Matt Canavan remarked last August, the Coalition is ‚Äúlatching onto‚Äù nuclear energy ‚Äúbecause it fixes a political issue for us‚Äù and conceded ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt the cheapest form of power‚Äù. But nuclear‚Äôs uses go far beyond being the glue that keeps the Coalition stuck together. Those ‚Äúcentre right voters‚Äù who board the nuclear train may do so in the belief that it will eventually take them to a clean and cheap energy destination. That ride, as Pyne clearly believes, is a fantasy. What he does not come clean about is that the Coalition is as relentless as ever in its adherence to fossil fuels, and either denigrates or ignores the already burgeoning shift to renewables, by governments, householders and corporations. Is this anything but climate-change denial? And Dutton is disingenuous about the nuclear cost-of-living relief when he says, ‚ÄúAustralians will be better off under our plan‚Äù. When?
Fiona Colin, Malvern East

Real genius
The assertion there‚Äôs genius in Dutton‚Äôs nuclear plan is wrong. A genius Australian political leader today would be championing the unique economic opportunities for our country to rapidly shift to 100 per cent renewables and explaining the urgency to act today to avoid a catastrophic 3 degrees or more rise in temperature in our children‚Äôs lifetime.
Jenny Smithers, Ashburton

A costly path
Christopher Pyne applauds Peter Dutton‚Äôs nuclear plans as a way to appease climate deniers, renewable energy sceptics and those concerned with spiralling energy costs in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. What Pyne fails to address is the scenario whereby Dutton wins the next election, puts Australia on the nuclear path, then loses the next election or the one after that.
Labor and the Greens will then be committed to unravelling the nuclear plan and setting Australia back on the path to a solely renewable energy future. The cost of this U-turn will be enormous. A renewable future backed by all parties makes much more sense.
Graeme Lechte, Brunswick West

Snared by patrons
Malcolm Knox (‚ÄúA disaster our leaders can‚Äôt ignore‚Äù, 5/1) explores the chances of Labor sitting down post-election and reading Michael Mann, Naomi Klein and James Bradley to formulate effective measures to combat global heating. Tragically, the chances of this are almost negligible and, in a recent essay, Tim Winton provides the reason: our leaders are collaborators with fossil fuel colonialists. These collaborators are ‚Äúso ensnared in webs of patronage and co-option they can neither see nor acknowledge our real predicament, which is a state of global subjugation to fossil capitalism‚Äù.
When will climate inaction be called out as climate criminality and fossil fuel lobbyists banned from strutting the corridors of federal parliament? These are the manipulators of Winton‚Äôs fossil fuel colonialists. When will we cease to subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of $14 billion per annum?
Ian Bayly, Upwey

Machine caffeine
If the main component of the cost of coffee in a cafe is wages (‚ÄúCharge $7 for a coffee? Some stressed-out cafe owners would rather shut down‚Äù, 7/1), how about doing what the supermarkets are doing: replace staff with machines. In parts of Germany you won‚Äôt find baristas, it‚Äôs all machines, and they make great coffee, on par with most barista coffees, without the wait. And let‚Äôs not forget: in contrast to food, barista coffee is a lifestyle choice, not a life essential.
Ralph B√∂hmer, St Kilda West

Our willing sacrifice
My wife and I both worked full-time (I was a teacher at a private school, until my recent retirement) to provide a private school education for both our children. We paid over 90 per cent of the cost of that education (federal funding per year equated to approximately $3000 per child). Meanwhile, the children down the street were educated in the public system (state and federal funding was approximately $17,000 per child). People question whether the funding system is inequitable. It appears it is. And here‚Äôs the rub: My wife and I knew that the income taxes we paid were used in part to educate the kids down the road. We don‚Äôt expect to be thanked for that, but I am getting tired of being criticised for being a ‚Äúprivate school parent‚Äù. We simply wanted the best for our children and were prepared to make sacrifices. For parents that choose not to, well, that is a guilt trip they have to battle with.
Tim Habben, Hawthorn

No regrets
I sent my two children to the local high school in the western suburbs despite myself and my husband having attended private schools. Both achieved remarkable results, one being a doctor and one a physiotherapist, and they loved every moment. The community vibe, the flexibility around their sporting life and the closeness to home made the seven years an amazing experience. One was even offered a scholarship for a private school in year 11 and 12 and declined because they loved their school and the people in it. Great things happen in local schools that don‚Äôt cost a bomb, so consider them and save yourself an awful lot of money. You may need it to help with their HECS fees.
Georgia Birch, Ascot Vale

Better ways to spend $50k
As a grandparent I was quite happy to help my child with their home deposit because house prices were inflated by those who, unlike me, see houses as only an investment rather than a place to bring up a family. But as a former public school teacher I agree with Jordan Baker (‚ÄúHow the bank of nan and pop is making our polarised school system even worse‚Äù, 7/1) and have fully supported him in choosing a public school education. I want my grandchildren to experience and gain from one of the remaining bastions of a democratic society and in doing so to be part of enriching that society.
There are far more socially beneficial ways of spending $50,000.
Ian Keese, Doncaster

What crisis?
Why is it called a crisis when a democratically elected government party in a stable country changes its prime minister? The fact that it can happen in Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, sometimes in the US, and others with little effect shows it is not a crisis but a change which is part of good democracy. The sudden deaths of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Harold Holt and John Curtin, the resignations of John Gorton, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Jacinda Ardern, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and even the sacking of Gough Whitlam were not crises but demonstrations of stability of government.
It is a crisis in South Korea where Yoon Suk Yeol had a sudden rush of silliness and put democracy in danger by declaring martial law.

For some reason, the term ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù has all sorts of negative connotations to many people, including people who do or could benefit from it. This attitude is heavily misguided and mostly due to propaganda from vested right-wing interests and the fallacy of people ‚Äúthinking rich‚Äù. Perhaps if people referred to socialism as ‚Äúhumanitarianism‚Äù or, as Newman suggests, simply ‚Äúfair‚Äù, it might be better accepted.

High-cost camping
Re the high cost of caravan parks (‚ÄúCaravan park fees soar as free sites snapped up‚Äù, 6/1), down at Port Fairy, where we are camped, it is really obvious. I have never seen the park so empty as it is now for this time of year. And every day so many leave. I think parks are now so expensive families can only afford maybe a week.
Caravan parks are now becoming an expensive holiday and you can tell by the prevalence of pricey four-wheel-drives that only those with a bit of cash can now afford to be here. Terrible for those who could once afford a camping holiday but which is now out of their reach.
This also has a profound effect on holiday towns. Without action many local businesses dependent on visitors will not survive.

Taken to another level
It is encouraging to see that infill development is still being considered to enable more apartments to be built with access to already developed infrastructure (‚ÄúOrmond sky tower rises in rent push‚Äù, 7/1). However, buildings of 10 storeys are still inappropriate in residential areas where the surrounding real estate is low-level housing. This application is bound to create community concern, with those opposed to the development considered NIMBYs, whereas if the whole development was limited to just six storeys it may well pass and set the standard for development in suburban areas.

Dog ownership
While admiring the entrepreneurship of young business owners providing a dog poo pick-up service (‚ÄúCrap Job? Not if you can turn dog poo into dollars‚Äù, 6/1), one has to question the commitment to dog ownership of able-bodied people using such a service. I totally understand that this could be a physically difficult task for some, but to outsource a five-minute daily task due to a claimed lack of time or energy is absurd. I have a dog and admittedly it‚Äôs not my favourite job but nor was changing my kids‚Äô nappies. With the outsourcing of so many basic activities like shopping, cooking, cleaning, dog walking and now poo picking-up, the line between necessity and laziness is becoming blurred.

I‚Äôm more so frustrated with my job than I am my body, but that‚Äôs beside the point‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt know what I was getting into at work because nowhere in the job description nor the paper I was given that listed a few responsibilities of the night shift, explained the entirety of what I was about to do. I was up on my feet the entire night, with some short breaks in between where I could sit down while we did some paperwork, but other than that I didn‚Äôt stay at the desk very long and I was not okay. 

I‚Äôm supposed to be a receptionist and most receptionists do not do what I had to do. At least not in my experience working at senior living facilities (which I still work at right now) as a receptionist. I had to do basic custodian duties my whole shift, collect trash on each and every single floor, walk all the halls and make sure residents didn‚Äôt put trash out, I had to make coffee, I had to wipe down every single surface, I had to clean everything and anything. It was like I was a custodian yet I was hired to be a receptionist. I didn‚Äôt do anything like this at my last job as a receptionist at another senior living facility in my area, the only trash and cleaning I did was at the desk and I straightened things out in the lobby sometimes.

I don‚Äôt know why we have to do so much. But my body was absolutely not having it. My heart rate didn‚Äôt come down from 140 the entire shift, I was very symptomatic, I had dizziness, I almost passed out multiple times, and breathing felt like I was breathing through a tube. I felt bad to ask for breaks because my coworker who trained me last night is an older woman, much older than me, (22), and I didn‚Äôt want her to do everything by herself if I‚Äôm there. So I suffered through.

I‚Äôm now paying the consequences and I could barely get out of bed today. I am absolutely fatigued, my body cannot handle my weight when I stand up, I had some pseudo seizures back to back, and my FND which I‚Äôm also diagnosed with is kicking my ass with partial paralysis episodes too. I just can‚Äôt do this. But my husband says I need to keep working because he can‚Äôt afford to allow me to stop working right now. Yet I don‚Äôt know if I can keep doing this crap.

Fiora's **W ability, Parry**, is widely regarded as one of the most powerful abilities in **League of Legends**. Mastering this ability can transform Fiora into the strongest 1v1 champion in the game. Parry offers **incredible outplay potential** and can turn what should be a losing matchup into a free kill. However, to maximize Parry‚Äôs effectiveness, you need to optimize a few key components of your setup and reaction time. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about Fiora's Parry and how to improve your reaction time to ensure success.

# Understanding Ability Cast Times in League of Legends

In League of Legends, the cast time of an ability is the time between when a champion casts an ability and when that ability actually hits or takes effect. The cast time can vary significantly between abilities, and some abilities have extremely low cast times, which can make it challenging to react to them, especially when you‚Äôre trying to use Fiora‚Äôs Parry.

The lowest possible cast time for an ability in League is 0.25 seconds (or 250 milliseconds). Interestingly, the average human reaction time is around 200 milliseconds‚Äîmeaning that on paper you should be able to react easily to any ability in league.

https://preview.redd.it/yo8g8wldaobe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d89bd55ecfb64bd5edd95553aa6a2e60c5a00c

However, even if your reaction time is good, **perfectly reacting to these abilities** can still feel impossible. The reason for this is that YOU aren't optimizing your setup and it's dogshit, you are also working against a **time budget**.

In this guide, we‚Äôll discuss how to optimize your **ping**, **monitor refresh rate**, **keyboard actuation point**, and **human reaction time** to ensure you can reliably land your Parry at the right moment.

# Key Components of a Successful Parry

To successfully react to abilities, you have a **time budget** of 250 milliseconds. Everything from when the enemy casts an ability to when you activate your Parry must happen within this window. Here are four critical components to consider for optimizing your Parry reaction:

# 1. Reducing Ping

Ping can have a **huge impact** on your reaction time. The lower your ping, the faster you can react to enemy abilities. Here‚Äôs how you can reduce it:

* **Move closer to the server**:  LMAO just move bro.
* **Use a VPN or latency-reducing software**: Software like **ExitLag** can help reduce ping by 10-15 milliseconds, making a noticeable difference in your reaction time.

# 2. Monitor Refresh Rate

Your **monitor refresh rate** determines how quickly what your PC or GPU processes gets displayed. A higher refresh rate reduces the **delay** between your inputs and what you see on screen.

* **Set your monitor to the highest FPS possible** in Windows settings. A higher refresh rate (such as 144Hz or 240Hz) can shave off **7-10 milliseconds** from your time budget.

# 3. Optimizing Keyboard Actuation Point (THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR)

The **keyboard actuation point** is the distance a key must be pressed down to register. Reducing this distance can significantly improve reaction time.

* **Standard keyboards** have an actuation point of **4mm**, while **mechanical keyboards** have an actuation point of **2mm**.
* **Rapid trigger keyboards** (such as the **Wooting** keyboard) allow you to adjust the actuation point to as low as **0.1mm**, effectively reducing the distance by 20 times. This can reduce reaction time by **20-50 milliseconds**.

I personally in an effort to making this guide, ran multiple tests using a keyboard with a 0.1mm actuation point vs a 2mm mechanical keyboard and the result was an **average improvement of 30-35 milliseconds** in reaction time.

# 4. Improving Human Reaction Time

Your **human reaction time** is one of the most important factors in using Parry effectively. Here‚Äôs how to improve it:

* **Caffeine**: Drinking coffee or pre-workout before your League session can improve reaction time.
* **Anticipate enemy abilities**: Focus on the **enemy character model** and look for cues that indicate they‚Äôre about to use an ability. This works particularly well when they stop moving to cast.
* **Get enough sleep**: An **8-hour good night‚Äôs sleep** is the most proven way to improve your reaction time. Sleep plays a huge role in cognitive function and reflexes.

By optimizing these three factors, you could improve your reaction time by at the very least **20-25 milliseconds**.

# Comparing Optimized vs. Non-Optimized Setups

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison between two players:

* **Player A** has **5ms ping** but no optimizations.
* **Player B** has **optimized ping, monitor settings, and keyboard actuation point**, but their ping is 50ms.
* **Player A** exceeds the **250ms time budget**, making it difficult to react to key abilities.
* **Player B**, with all optimizations, can **successfully react in time** to use Parry, resulting in a much higher success rate.

https://preview.redd.it/b6hu96n6aobe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f16c73f6ca10c1091ded087a7b37f67418a540

# Conclusion: Mastering Parry for Maximum Outplay Potential

When you combine **optimized ping**, a **high refresh rate**, **low keyboard actuation**, and **fast reaction time**, you‚Äôll have a much higher success rate using **Fiora‚Äôs Parry** ability. In fact, with these optimizations, you can expect a **90% or higher success rate** in reacting to enemy abilities.

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Optimize your setup** for lower ping, higher monitor refresh rate, and quicker keyboard actuation.
* **Improve reaction time** by staying caffeinated, anticipating enemy abilities, and getting enough sleep.
* With **proper timing**, **Fiora‚Äôs Parry** can turn many losing fights into easy wins.

If you follow these steps, you‚Äôll be on your way to becoming a Fiora master, with the potential to **outplay even the most challenging opponents**.

It doesn‚Äôt let me focus or concentrate on daily task and life if I am watching a movie & I see an actor I recognize but don‚Äôt remember their name my mind tells me to look them up on Google and feel satisfied after looking it up and knowing what I didn‚Äôt know before.
Sometimes I‚Äôm using my phone and my mind would be like let‚Äôs call mom and then when I‚Äôm calling her it‚Äôs like let‚Äôs text my brother or let‚Äôs look up a video on YouTube it wants me to do so many things at once and I end up doing nothing.
-inner monologue 
I have a constant voice in my head and it‚Äôs my voice always having constant chatter in my head especially  when I‚Äôm trying to sleep or rest it‚Äôs the one that directs everything mentioned above.
-Memory Pops
Random memories come to mind some time , especially when I pass by places that I have been to before. 
(Example=I pass by a store in my car & I get a random memory of when I was there buying something it comes randomly.
Also if someone says a word I can also get a memory triggered by the word. (Example= some one says chocolate I instantly have a memory pop of the first time I tired chocolate when I was 6 years old ‚Äúwhich by the way I didn‚Äôt have chocolate in my native country so when I got to the u.s I was 6 and it was when I tried chocolate lol‚Äù) 
-Coffee makes me sleepy 
When ever I drink Cuban or black coffee I get sleepy and tired I can even take a full nap.
-closed eye hallucination 
When I close my eyes I can see random images or random objects when trying to sleep or relax with my eyes closed.
-constant music in head 
I have constant music in my head random songs or words or lyrics on repeat especially when I wake up in the mornings 
-forgetting where I put certainty things like my phone Keyes or other important objects like my wallet.
-irritability & anger or act on impulse 
(Example= throwing my phone across the room or against the wall when my wife tells  me I‚Äôm using it too much and we argue about it)
So these are some of the symptoms I wanted to share with you guys and I want to know who else deals with these things and what coping mechanisms you use because my doctor won‚Äôt send me stimulants because of underlying health issues that I had in the past with a heart arrhythmia so I have to deal with this with out any chemicals!

1hw7vp8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hw7vp8,Water hardness and scute retention,"Hello, I‚Äôd like some turtle husbandry advice concerning water hardness and how that can cause scute retention. 

I‚Äôve owned turtles for about 8 years and I‚Äôve always had a problem with scute retention. Living in the Midwest, my tap water is so hard it‚Äôs basically liquid rock. I know this will be considered to some as a blessing, and indeed I‚Äôve kept guppies for about 10 years and they LOVE the hard water, but I‚Äôve found with my turtles that the water is so hard it causes problems, namely mineral deposition on the shell and scute retention. My turtles have a hard time shedding their old scutes. Typically they can build up into multiple layers overtime or if they do shed off they peel and flake in small pieces. To remedy this I‚Äôve been scrubbing their shells with a soft toothbrush and have invested in a RO system for water changes to help soften the water. 

I‚Äôve triple checked their diet; I feed them  hikari wheat germ pellets at least once a week rotated with calcium dusted isopods or tenebrio molitor beetles, carrots, and recently I‚Äôve been blending leaf lettuce, carrots, calcium powder, repashy soilent green and repashy grub pie into a gel food.  My turtles don‚Äôt like to eat their greens so I started making this gel food as a way to sneak it into their diet as much as I can. My musk turtle is a year old and has no interest in greens, although I have caught him munching on the Java moss growing in his tank a few times. My painted turtle is a few years old and will only eat carrots. I‚Äôve tried every leafy green I can think of and she has no interest. I‚Äôve introduced duckweed and water lettuce into her tank as a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù source of greens and I have seen her eating the duckweed a few times. She seems a little overweight so I‚Äôve only been feeding her protein foods once a week and carrots for the other meals. 

I‚Äôve triple checked their environments: 
They both have uvb bulbs that I change once every 6 months, basking spots around 90-100 degrees, water temps at 76, and no nitrate or nitrite. I‚Äôve noticed my painted turtle doesn‚Äôt like to bask under the heat lamp these days, preferring the spot closest to the water as you can see in the pics. She does typically sit under the basking spot early in the morning, opting for the spot away from the heat bulb for the remainder of the day. A few months ago I noticed blood in her stool so I took her to the vet. The vet tested her for bacterial infection and it came back positive. She gave me oral antibiotics and dewormer which I administered to my turtle and haven‚Äôt noticed any problems since. I got her about a year ago from a lady on Facebook who took her from the wild so it‚Äôs possible she already had some type of infection or parasites. She‚Äôs very enthusiastic about food and swims fine, acting like a normal turtle from my experience. I have a whisper filter on my musk turtle‚Äôs ten gallon tank and a 1500 gph pond pump and filter on my painted turtle‚Äôs 200 gallon tub. 

Now that I‚Äôve explained all of this, I‚Äôd like your opinion. How bad does the scute retention on my turtles look? Is there anything else I can do besides what I‚Äôve already been doing to help them to shed properly? ",1,1736299643.0,turtle,1,1.0,False

A man‚Äôs leadership being accepted, respected and submitted to is the only way in which marriage can have a balanced functional dynamic‚Äîallowing the man to be masculine and woman to be feminine.

Non-Muslim families have very high prevalence of psychological and emotional disorders. There‚Äôs no comparison in respect to the meanness, evil, immorality and degeneracy that prevails in non-Muslims families and Muslim families. Ofcourse, some Muslims can be even worse than non-Muslims in their actions, but we‚Äôre talking about a traditional Muslim household and a standard non-Muslim household.

Many Muslim men in marriages with reverts are in miserable marriages suffering greatly, which in no way means this always the case.

There‚Äôs a grounded meanness and the ability to leave with ease, because marriage usually in non-Muslim households is seen as a legal matter. That‚Äôs the perception they grow up with. Many carry this perception even when married‚Äîthat marriage is just a matter of a piece of paper that you can exit any time.

Her accepting Islam, prayers and her being a Muslimah is all great, but just to be a believer isn‚Äôt enough to sustain a marriage; many qualities are required to make a marriage work.

As time passes, more and more marriages will fail.

There‚Äôs always caution required when getting married, but when you‚Äôre marrying from a pool that contains general dysfunction, attachment disorders and mental disorders far higher than the Muslim population, you have to do your work.

No one is interested in being a single parent. 

Out of many examples I can give you, I‚Äôll give you an example of a student of mine whose wife is also my student. He had the most miserable marriage with this American Pakistani woman who ruined both his children (both are mentally ill) and she made his life a living nightmare.

I asked him what would he do if he was not married and were to marry again? He said he would never marry an American woman generally; he‚Äôd go to Pakistan and select a traditional woman raised by a loving family.

Does that mean men shouldn‚Äôt get married to reverts? Ofcourse this is not what‚Äôs said here. What‚Äôs said is to work with caution. If women from Muslim families in this time and age are so weak and suffer so badly, what about someone who comes from a Non-Muslim background? The quality of women is generally deteriorating; TikTok and social network has largely ruined women, their attention span, the ability to understand in a non-triggering manner, regulate their emotions and look at the situation correctly. All of these are foundational elements to help a child grow into a secure adult.

In order to help you understand things better, let‚Äôs consider an example.

If someone has a deep bone fracture and they accept Islam, the bone fracture is not going to go away.

Similarly, if someone has an avoidant attachments style, severe narcissistic, paranoid or borderline personality disorder, none of this is going to go away all by itself just by accepting Islam.

Just how by accepting Islam you‚Äôll still need food and drink, by accepting Islam you still need serious psychological help if you‚Äôre a neurodivergent of any kind.

Some genius reading this would think ‚ÄúBut what you‚Äôre saying can all, also be in Muslim families.‚Äù Correct. But overall, Muslim families usually don‚Äôt eat pork, drink alcohol, consume riba and do many vices Christians do who are Christians by name.

The prevalence of immorality always stays far higher in non Muslims than Muslims.

So if you‚Äôre marrying a revert, 80% of the job is to see if her parents have been mentally stable, secure and especially her father‚Äîhe had a loving relationship with their daughter.

There is this extreme glorification taking place of reverts and many people get married and end up divorced.

For someone who grew up in a non Muslim household, the seriousness of nikah isn‚Äôt properly emphasized along with many other matters which hold the relationship together in a manner congruent with the path of AllƒÅh.

If the revert you want to marry comes from a background non-loving and distant background, here‚Äôs another idea many non-experienced young virgin men have: ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs not like her family! She‚Äôs different.‚Äù

Possibly. But that if she‚Äôs deeply wounded by her parents and you the great savior want to rescue her from her severe childhood dysfunction, you need a time-machine, to go back in time, be her father, re-parent her, come back again, be a non-father to her, and then get married to her. Does it make sense? What makes even less sense than this trying to save someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be saved.

If you‚Äôre going to marry a revert woman, you have to see if she‚Äôs teachable and she‚Äôs been actively doing the work internally and not just started doing it to be your wife.

Avoidants form to be some of the worse of all spouses usually, and if you combine an avoidant from values of a non-muslim family raised in an atmosphere of family highly incompatible with a man‚Äôs leadership, you‚Äôre going to eventually become a shell of yourself, lose your personality and live a miserable, horrible life.

If you‚Äôre selecting a revert, marry one whose parents are also reverts and are secure, loving and kind people. They‚Äôre emotionally intelligent, safe and there are no divorces in the family.

The men I have taught and intelligent families I‚Äôve known, they go to Muslim countries and select women from there for marriage. They don‚Äôt even marry Muslim women living in the west because of how much they‚Äôre infected. This doesn‚Äôt apply to all women ofcourse.

Do you want to be a single, miserable, ruined, heart-broken father? If not, then don‚Äôt work with emotions. Work with mathematics, emotional objectivity and probability.

Usually, non-Muslim marriages fail and in non-Muslim households there‚Äôs great underestimation of the seriousness of marriage and its true value.

Just because someone has accepted Islam doesn‚Äôt mean all what‚Äôs required within will change within a week.

I‚Äôm saving your life. But it goes back to what I said earlier.

Those who don‚Äôt want to be saved, can‚Äôt be saved.

I‚Äôm Sam, a 23-year-old Christian guy from the heart of the Midwest, and I‚Äôm putting myself out here with a hope as big as the Missouri sky: to find someone extraordinary to walk through life with.

Here‚Äôs who I am and what I bring to the table:

* **Brains and heart:** I hold a biology degree and a fascination with how science intersects with the soul. My dream is to merge biology and psychology to help others‚Äîcounseling, maybe? Who knows!
* **A giving spirit:** I volunteer with adults with disabilities, and it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding parts of my life. Their joy inspires me to give more, love more, and keep growing.
* **The self-improvement streak:** I‚Äôm working hard to cut weight and stay healthy, building strength while keeping my fluffy side intact. I believe in showing up as my best self, and I‚Äôd love someone who values that journey, too.
* **Personality perks:** Quirky and caring, I‚Äôm the guy who‚Äôll whip up a great meal for you, debate the best Greek myth over coffee, or cheer you on while you chase your dreams.

Now, about the romantic stuff (brace yourself for the cheese): I‚Äôm someone who believes that life is meant to be shared‚Äîdreams, struggles, victories, and those quiet moments that take your breath away. I don‚Äôt just want a partner; I want someone whose story intertwines with mine, someone I can encourage, adore, and share every chapter with.

Physically, I‚Äôm a bit chubby but strong, 5'9"", with fluffy dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and a birthmark on my right cheek. (Yes, I have pictures on my profile!) But more than that, I hope to catch your eye with what‚Äôs inside.

What I‚Äôm looking for:  
A confident, driven woman who dreams big and laughs easily. Someone who values self-improvement and kindness, who believes in the beauty of a love rooted in friendship, faith, and mutual growth.

From my experience, I mostly find guys through Bumble and in the past, Grindr when I would find myself in the mood. Though, I'm not really interested in one night stands/hookups anymore and looking for something long term. I don't want to generalize but I'm kinda getting the assumption that most guys just want to fuck and are not ready to commit. Even though I'm really tired of the app, I cave since I don't really go out to party or anything like that so it's really hard for me to meet guys. I don't think the gym is a good place either since everybody's just there to workout. Sometimes, I even try to hangout alone at coffee shops in hopes na someone might notice me and maybe want to share a table or something (but this is my delulu self talking huhu).

https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1hmt85s/the_wapo_is_now_claiming_without_evidence_that/m3xd92z/?context=3 

about how I was having a hard time unsubbing from Wapo because of the 3 Sunday crossword puzzles that I love (not to mention the dailies). The Washington Post has been part of my life for at least 5 decades. I can't say that about many other things. I really had to think about unsubscribing for several days 

I have memories of my dad bringing home 2 or 3 fat Sunday newpapers in the 70's (Wapo always the fattest) and sprawling on the floor with Dondi and Beetle Baily and Peanuts cartoons and learning about crosswords and acrostics.  

Memories from the early 80's sitting at a HoJo's counter in Charlottesville on Sundays when I was a broke ass long haired kid. I would drink free refill coffee with a Wapo that cost $1 and enjoy lots of news and a Sunday puzzle and a caffeine buzz for a couple of hours.  Great time killer when you're between places to live....

Memories of faux arguing and fighting with roomates about the Wapo Sunday puzzle and getting up earlier to get the paper until you just start buying enough copies for everyone.  Memories of collabs with significant others and significant randos on clues to Sunday crosswords.  

The current Sunday Wapo offers three big crossword puzzles online that I really looked forward to.  The wapo puzzles and the NYT puzzle took up a couple hours of my Sunday AM and it was a ritual that I did for as long as Wapo has been online.  Before that when Wapo was print edition they offered one Sunday crossword that was in the Wapo Sunday magazine.  The Sunday Wapo magazine was glossy and I always did it in pen and fuckups were embarassing and obvious and comical sometimes.  Now you get 3 crosswords on Sunday in the digital edition and it was a high point of my week (I know, sigh).

So even though this missive is really about my love affair with the wapo sunday crossword puzzle, don't get me wrong - I actually read the rest of the paper, daily, Sunday, on the metro, you name it - I regarded the Post as kind of a local paper back in the day when they really did do more DC MD VA locality coverage and an an unbaised arbiter of national politics.

Lately I have become unhappy with the direction Wapo has taken in regards to making overt political choices due to ownership direction.  The Post has a long history of journalistic independence and integrity and prize winning reporting and I think it has abandoned its original mission of objectivity due to ownership that is pressuring the paper to make editorial decisions that seem to curry favor with the incoming administration.  I feel it is no longer an independent arbiter of the news that it presents and don't trust it as a news source.

This particular incident triggered some action by my procrastinating ass:

I apologized and told him it wasn't intentional, and that I realized I didn't have any recent ones. He said I should've asked him for some, and I told him he was right, but that it was a last minute. I asked him to send me any photos he has so I can include them for the next one. He hasn't sent me any, but I think it's because he's also probably hoping they'll be fully divorced by the time the next one comes around.

Is there anything I can do to make my dad feel better? Should I recreate the photobook (I'd have to remake and reorder it) and just find old photos of him to include? ",2,1736298019.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Initially, I had stated that this review was (2/6), though after further consideration, I've decided to remove the limit. I really enjoy writing these.

Without further ado, get reading! Let me know your thoughts, I'm always happy to hear your feedback!

Thanks, everyone. I appreciate y'all :)

**BOIS 1920**

*Classic 1920:*¬†Intrigued by the notes of apricot and basil, I was excited to try¬†*Classic 1920.*¬†The opening is bright, showcasing the juniper and bergamot, a slight bitter, but aromatic profile of basil, and a nice dash of spicy sweetness from the nutmeg. As time passes, the fragrance fades into a nice, classic, slightly barbershop fragrance. The florals in the middle keep it sweet, but not too powdery, in my opinion. It remained fresh. On the base, the fragrance grounds itself with some woodiness, though not overwhelmingly. On my skin, it stayed pretty fresh and sweet throughout its lifespan. Speaking of which, the longevity and projection are not great, maybe 4-6 hours best? Not abysmal, but not particularly substantial, unless you don‚Äôt mind reapplication. Overall, this fragrance does have a classically posh, gentleman-like feel to it.¬†**(6/10)**

**HOUSE OF B≈å**

*Infinitoud:*¬†Truthfully, I got my nose on this because I needed a filler for the month of December on my ScentBird subscription. Now, I have made my fair share of mistakes in life, but this, ladies and gentleman‚Ä¶ this was not one of them. I was completely taken aback by how much I enjoyed this fragrance. It was simply,¬†*incredible*. The opening is beautiful. Based on the described notes, one could assume this is a very woody, earthy, natural fragrance from start to finish, and while those aromas may reveal themselves later, that is not the case in the opening. The peyote and myrrh, in unison, create such a unique, fresh, aromatic, herbaceous, sweetness to the top of this stunning fragrance. Later, as expected, the fragrance melds into a woody, seductive, oriental scent that exudes sophistication and discretion. The longevity is good and the projection is not beastly, which I prefer. Overall, I am over the moon to have found this, though I cannot say the same about the price‚Ä¶¬†**(10/10)**

**ARAMIS**

*Havana:*¬†I am still hoping, one day, I will be able to own a bottle of¬†*Tobacco Reserve.*¬†However, until then, I was satisfied to try¬†*Havana.*¬†Inspired by the Cuban city itself, I expected certain things: a classically masculine aroma, prevalent tobacco, and a timeless feel. While the tobacco is understated, taking a back seat to other prominent players, the timelessness and masculinity made themselves known. The mandarin, basil, and spiciness on the opening is pleasant and fresh. The carnation is a key note in this fragrance, giving it a classic, floral, sweetness, almost reminiscent of a foug√®re. Overall,¬†*Havana*¬†is a fresh, classic, masculine, and timeless fragrance. Its longevity is good. The projection is beastly at the beginning, but clams down over time.¬†**(7.5/10)**

**LORENZO VILLORESI**

*Atman Xaman:*¬†I will start with what I know: The longevity is great and the projection, though not beastly, is noticeable, and becomes intimate over time. I will admit, I had a hard time pinning this fragrance. I was eager to try it, as it‚Äôs noted to be tobacco heavy, but it was not what I expected.¬†*Atman Xaman*¬†had an old-world, dusty, forgotten, slightly pungent smell to it. I reminded me of an ancient library, but with a warm, sandy, desert, mysterious undertone. It was not deterring, however, like I‚Äôve noticed from Lorenzo Villoresi, he takes you on a different ride than you expected. I wish I could pin more of the notes and profiles for reviewing purposes, but I don‚Äôt want to be dishonest or lead you astray. My description above is the best I can do. I will say, the mate did com through for me, not overwhelmingly, but it was the only note I felt I could actually identify among the mysterious aroma. Overall, I enjoyed this. It felt masculine and sensual, due to its mysterious disposition. I wonder how many times I can say ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù in a review lol¬†**(7/10)**

*Spezie: Spezie*¬†was like nothing I had smelled before; it really pushed me. Based on its description, I expected a heavily spicy aroma. And that is what I got... well, in one way or another. Let me break this down for you. You see, I break ‚Äúspicy‚Äù down into three categories: 1. Spicy: food that hurts the tongue and makes your eyes water. 2. Spice-filled: tasting/smelling various spices, without the hurt of the heat. Think: cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, turmeric, etc. 3. Spicy (fragrance): spice, in association to fragrance, is usually more crowd-pleasing, aiding other prominent notes in the scent. These could also include cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., but it is less risk-taking.¬†*Spezie*¬†fell into the second category. The first spray knocked me back, not because it was bad, but because it was truly a new experience. I thought I was transported to an eastern spice bazaar. It was spicy, salty, herby, aromatic, and transportive. It is definitely not for the weak of heart, or the conventional ‚Äúspicy-fragrance‚Äù lover. I cannot emphasize enough how real the spices smelled. You could have been holding a bowl of bay leaves under my nose an I would‚Äôve believed you. After the heavy spices died down, you are left with a lighter, spicy, aromatic, sweet/fresh, intimate, scent. The longevity is pretty good. I am rating this off of my preference, but I really learned a lot from¬†*Spezie*¬†and it felt artistic and creative.¬†**(5/10)**

*Theseus:*¬†The opening is fresh and citrusy. It fades into a woody, soapy, lightly floral, and SLIGHTLY spice-filled fragrance. The woodiness isn‚Äôt strong, nor are the other notes, in fact, it‚Äôs quite a light fragrance, and didn‚Äôt seem to last too long. I couldn‚Äôt make out many of the listed notes. Mr. Villoresi‚Äôs creations seem to each have a unique spice-filled quality, leading me to believe it‚Äôs part of the house DNA. That would make sense, considering he uses his travels to the East for inspiration. I‚Äôve already spoken on what kind of spiciness is utilized within his perfumes, you can see¬†*Spezie*¬†above. The longevity was very mild, so was the projection. Not my favorite from Villoresi¬†**(3/10)**

**TUMI**

*Kinetic:*¬†This fragrance falls into the same category as¬†*Eros Flame*¬†by Versace, which I have already reviewed. It has that strong, mass-appealing aroma, one that can make your throat dry if you breathe it in too much. Strangely, my nose got a cola scent upon its first spray. The associations we make with fragrances can be questionable sometimes, but I must be honest. Anyways, after I got the cola idea out of my head, difficult as it was, I tried to smell¬†*Kinetic*¬†for what it was. Truthfully, it‚Äôs nothing special. If you have¬†*Sauvage*¬†or those alike, you don‚Äôt need this. Comparatively, this one leans a bit sweeter, fruitier. My biggest issue with these types of fragrances is that that they are terribly synthetic smelling. It can feel like you‚Äôre inhaling straight chemicals. It has strong projection for about an hour. The longevity is pretty good. I want to note: this is¬†*not*¬†bad smelling by any means, however it is just not for me.¬†**(2/10)**

**DAVIDOFF**

*Cool Water:*¬†The current formulation of¬†*Cool Water*¬†seems very different from what it ought to smell like based on its described notes. It felt a lot more linear than what I am, seemingly, supposed to smell. Let me start off by saying, it is not bad. It has a cool feeling to it (no pun intended). I also commend its contribution to the progression of fragrance, being one of the first aquatics introduced to the world. I think I would‚Äôve liked for it to be softer. It seemed to lean a bit ‚Äúaxe body spray,‚Äù which feels sacrilegious to say knowing its spot among the greats. Which is why I must also say, I would love to have given this a true chance by testing its original formulation. Can‚Äôt win them all I guess. Overall, the projection is good and the longevity seemed alright. I think (and hope) that the version I am smelling is a victim to reformulation and high demand, causing it to be a lesser version of its original. However, I will be basing this off of what I smelled.¬†**(3/10)**

**4160 TUESDAYS**

*Maxed Out:*¬†At first, I did not care for this fragrance whatsoever. It opened terribly boozy, which was disconcerting, jading my idea of what this fragrance could become. However, after spending more time with it, I fell in love, y‚Äôall. In. Love. Here is what I gathered about the smell: The opening is definitely rum-filled, backed up with lime and a hint of coconut. After that, the lime lingers, and the booziness leaves quickly (thankfully). It dries into an extremely sensual scent, in my opinion. The musk in the base is what makes this fragrance a standout. With the lime, coconut, rum, and tobacco, you may assume this fragrance to be gourmand-like. But I promise you, it is not. It does have a slight sweetness, but with the nuances of woods, cannabis, and spices, grounded by the musk, you get a smooth, masculine, and seductive scent. It reminds me of, and seems most appropriate for, a warm summer night, maybe at a classy beach front resort. Warm, dim lights are strung from linen canopies, the moon shines on the ocean, and you can hear the fresh, salty waves just across the sandy beach. A tall, dark stranger walks by, barefoot in the sand, wearing a linen shirt exposing his chest. The light breeze flows through his dark hair as he walks by, leaving a discreetly intoxicating and sensual trail behind him. Phew, is it getting hot in here? I hope that‚Äôs enough imagery for you, because that was getting awkward, though I would give my left arm to be him. Because, he is, in fact:¬†*him.*¬†Projection and longevity are good!¬†**(8.5/10)**

**ANDY TAUER**

*Sundowner:*¬†This one took me for a¬†*bumpy*¬†ride. Upon hearing about how tobacco-heavy this fragrance was, I knew I had to get my hands on it. Christmas came, and with it, so did a 5ml sample of¬†*Sundowner.*¬†Whoop Whoop! I open the vial, take a whiff, and‚Ä¶ well, I was unsure. It was not bad, but I wasn‚Äôt elated like I hoped I would be. So, as one does, I spent some time with it, wore it out. Luckily, it grew on me. I thought my nose was broken because I had difficulty getting a lot of the nuances described in this fragrance. I could, however, get a very heavy, dry tobacco scent. Then I stopped liking it. Again. It felt very one dimensional. I was getting frustrated. But, wait! There‚Äôs more! Today, on my fourth round of wearing it, I am enjoying it! I didn‚Äôt realize Mr. Tauer‚Äôs approach to fragrance was very heavy on natural, ethical ingredients, a lot of which are oils, essential oils, and absolutes. That helped me understand what I was smelling and appreciate its composition. Overall, I approve of this (not that anyone is looking for my approval). I really enjoy the classic, dry tobacco. The sparkling orange on the opening, for as long as it lasts, adds a nice touch, and I have now begun to identify some underlying notes, such as cocoa. Longevity is good. The projection is not crazy, which I enjoy.¬†**(7.4/10)**

**FRANCESCA BIANCHI**¬†

*The Dark Side:*¬† 2erf2This fragrance opens¬†*very*¬†honey-heavy. If you‚Äôve read my reviews before, you know that honey and I don‚Äôt jive. Lucky, the honey doesn‚Äôt remain too forward for very long. It was a dark honey, not a light honey, I thought I should mention that. Anyways, this fragrance has a dark, slightly dirty, sweetness to it. The spices are aromatic and fragrant, giving some nice depth and support to the obvious sweetness. Once the strength of the honey subsides, the florals continue the sweetness throughout, though the honey still lingers. The blend from honey to the florals is very well done, it‚Äôs hard to notice a distinct change. The incense is noticeable, adding some darkness to the composition. Woods can be detected later, though they aren‚Äôt prevalent. The projection isn‚Äôt too strong, but the longevity is good. This fragrance reminds me of a night out in a sleazy, underground club, getting drunk, walking home in a damp fog, getting grimy from it. Overall, I enjoyed spending time with this fragrance, but it isn‚Äôt to my particular taste.¬†**(4.7/10)**

*Sticky Fingers:*¬†If¬†*The Dark Side*¬†and¬†*Sticky Fingers*¬†are sisters, the former is the dark one (shocker), and the later is the good sister. Both open with, what I am coming to find, may be Miss Bianchi‚Äôs signature. I don‚Äôt quite know how to describe it, but they do have similar DNA. Bear with me, but it reminds me of eating spiced baklava. Don‚Äôt think ‚Äúsickly sweet pastry,‚Äù but try to envision what it smells like to eat each texture and taste each flavor. Riveting, I know. Anyways, while¬†*The Dark Side*¬†is more dirty and deep,¬†*Sticky Fingers*¬†is lighter. It is still sweet, though instead of deep sweetness, it felt brighter. The florals may help with this, and there is no honey, which can add a heaviness to fragrances. I found this fragrance to be¬†*very*¬†well blended. I enjoyed it more than the former. The projection is intimate and the longevity is great. Overall, not my go-to but a solid fragrance.¬†**(6.1/10)**

**EIGHT & BOB**

*Nuit de Meg√®ve:*¬†I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. I must not tell lies. This**GEORGE**¬†is a moment that I must remind myself: fragrance is subjective. With that being said,¬†*Nuit de Meg√®ve*¬†smelled very heavily of menthol/eucalyptus. That may seem mundane for my introduction, though I implore you to research how it‚Äôs marketed, specifically the listed notes. You will notice that the desired effect is quite opposite of my experience. For me,¬†*Nuit de Meg√®ve*¬†opened with citrus on the top, though it was a bit screechy. However, what followed was strange. A strong cooling blast of eucalyptus/menthol came through. I cannot explain it another way. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt mind. I thought it was a clean smell. I was able to pick up on some vetiver later, though the cooling sensation was prevent throughout. The projection was fine and the longevity was about six hours long. Though unexpected, I wasn‚Äôt devastated.¬†**(5/10)**

*Cap d‚ÄôAntibes:*¬†Ironically, this fragrance is actually meant to display cooling properties, not the former. The mint is a very nice opening to this fragrance, well-blended with violet and birch. It creates a cooling, aquatic greenery effect, one reminiscent of a coastal shores. There is a nice, classic maritime feel to this fragrance. Whites and blues flash through my mind. On this particular day you may find yourself sailing, or captaining a ship, though the temps aren‚Äôt particularly high this morning, in fact, they seem slightly chilling in the wind. The vanilla and incense on the base are comforting, smoothing the rest of the fragrance out, though still not losing the mint and fresh woodiness entirely. I liked how I was able to create a story upon spraying this fragrance; those are my favorite kind. Longevity was fine and the projection was actually pretty good.¬†**(7.2/10)**

*Egypt:*¬†The lavender and moss in the opening were quite beautiful. It‚Äôs funny how two simple notes that can be found in hundreds of other fragrances suddenly become something special if composed well. The lemon follows after about a minute, adding some bitter citrus to the mix. The spices creep their way in, creating a warm and spicy aroma. Later, on the dry down, you are able to smell some leather. It remains spicy, though I was still thinking about the opening. In my opinion, it wasn‚Äôt very reminiscent of Egypt. It felt pretty standard, apart from the opening. Projection is not crazy, and the longevity is solid.¬†**(4/10)**

**ZOOLOGIST**

*Rhinoceros:*¬†The opening threw me off, it was very pungent. If I wore it out, I am sure it could be off putting for others, though after about ten minutes it becomes something¬†*beautiful.*¬†Before I get there, though, let me explain the opening in more detail. It was definitely boozy, but very dry and bitter. I actually enjoyed the uniqueness of not being a sweet booziness. I think the perfumer leaned into the bitter, dark side of coffee. The basil is a nice touch, and the leather was raw and rough. Okay, now for the exciting part. I must preface by stating: I still have difficulty identifying the nuanced notes in fragrances, so if what I‚Äôm explaining is incorrect, please let me know. Through the bitter, rough, dry, ‚Äúhide‚Äù of¬†*Rhinoceros*, there came this faint sweetness. It grew as the fragrance settled. I believe it was the ylang ylang, maybe the sweet grass, though I don‚Äôt have a solid understanding of that profile yet. The tobacco is a nice addition. Together, the composition is incredibly smooth. I enjoyed this experience immensely. The longevity was well over eight hours and the projection was good.¬†**(8.7/10)**

*Musk Deer:*¬†Considering Zoologist‚Äôs unabashed, continued creation of funky, boundary-pushing, realistic fragrances,¬†*Musk Deer*¬†is quite tame. I, like many, hold Zoologist in high regard for their ability to give us realistic takes on the concept of creatures roaming this planet, not swayed by the opinions of what‚Äôs, ‚Äúnice‚Äù. Historically, musk deer glands have been used as an ingredient in perfumery, leading me to believe¬†*Musk Deer*would be something very similar: animalic, musk-y, and not particularly crowd pleasing. That is not what I experienced. The opening was very nice; cardamom and calamus oil created a unique, green opening. Minutes later, rose creeps its way in, remaining quite prominent for a long period of time. The powdery note from the rose was off putting and, frankly, unwanted. Once the powder subsides, the sweetness of the rose is bearable, especially in unison with the newly found woods that have entered. The fragrance ends on a very well-blended, woody, sweet, sensual note. Still, not very ‚Äúmusk deer,‚Äù if you ask me, but a nice fragrance overall. Longevity is great and projection is mild.¬†**(7.2/10)**",7,1736297871.0,fragrance,0,0.9,False

I‚Äôm new to the Bay Area (and the country!) and feeling a bit like a small fish in a very big, very well-networked pond. I‚Äôm turning to this awesome community for advice, insights, and maybe even a mentor to help me navigate the US job market. Bonus points if you have any insights or local wisdom to share about navigating the Bay Area.

**A little about me:**

* I‚Äôm originally from the Netherlands, with a MS in Quantitative Psychology and a PhD in Psychology/Engineering. I studied at great universities (though they‚Äôre less known in the US) and even did a research stint at Stanford for some Bay Area cred. My research focused on language, speech, and well-being.
* Back in Europe, I had a diverse career ‚Äì yet, mostly in startups. I‚Äôve done everything from coding to product management to sales and fundraising.
* I‚Äôve also had my fair share of jobs in door-to-door sales, hospitality, and customer support during college. If you need someone who can handle (endless) rejection with grace, pour a perfect beer, or explain complex ideas to anyone, I‚Äôm your person.
* While waiting for my work visa here, I focused on my own startup (a side hustle from grad school) and dove headfirst into networking events to build connections in the Bay Area.

**The challenge:**  
Since getting my green card in late September, I‚Äôve been hitting the ground running with job applications and weekly networking events. Despite this, I feel like I‚Äôm missing some key insights on how to break into the US job market.

In Europe, my varied background was celebrated, but here, it sometimes feels like the norm is a straight-line career path. In addition, I was making little mistakes like using ‚ÄúMS‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMSc‚Äù on my resume (-who knew?), so I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more I am missing and can improve on.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**  
I‚Äôm open to a range of roles and industries, particularly those where I can use my mix of analytical skills and people-focused experience. I‚Äôm also completely open to more junior roles as I learn the ropes of this market‚ÄîI‚Äôm confident I can grow quickly from there.

* **Tech/Product Roles:** Product management, UX research, data analysis, or human factors.
* **Startups:** Business development, growth strategy, operational roles, or honestly anything that lets me roll up my sleeves and get stuff done.
* **Consulting:** Roles focused on strategy, data-driven insights, or behavioral expertise.
* **Research:** Positions leveraging psychology, behavioral science, or human-computer interaction.

**How you can help:**

* **Advice:** If you‚Äôve been through a similar transition (especially as an immigrant), I‚Äôd love to hear what worked for you‚Äîor even just what didn‚Äôt.
* **Mentorship:** If you‚Äôve navigated the Bay Area job market successfully, I‚Äôd appreciate any guidance on how to sharpen my approach.
* **Tips & Tricks:** Resume hacks, networking dos and don‚Äôts, or even just insights into what stands out to recruiters would be amazing.

And hey, if you think I sound like someone you‚Äôd enjoy working with, feel free to slide into my DMs. No pressure‚Äîjust putting it out there!

Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from some of you soon (even if it‚Äôs just to share your favorite Bay Area coffee spots).

1hw75c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hw75c6/solitude_changed_to_loneliness/,Solitude changed to loneliness ,"Two days ago, after a phone call with someone I thought of as a friend where we talked about socializing and stuff, I (33m) got to think. I never really had close friends before and I was always fine living for myself. But speaking out loud that I only once had someone who gave me the feeling of friendship. Sadly she fell into a hole of drugs and depression and vanished out of my life. But even her never really cared about what‚Äôs going on in my life. 
I know a lot of people but they are at the best acquaintances. I can‚Äôt count how many people who I thought of as friends just vanished out of my life without telling me why. Life goes on and everyone walks a different path and sometimes those paths don‚Äôt go along, that‚Äôs normal and fine and I never would blame someone. 
I just can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs always happening. I don‚Äôt know what it means to be important to someone, cared for my well being (romantically or platonic). I‚Äôve never gotten a gift from someone besides parents and grandparents (with whom I‚Äôm not close, since we are too different), I can‚Äôt remember that someone congratulated me for my birthday or even thought of it. I‚Äôve never gotten a compliment from someone I care about, only occasional from strangers (I don‚Äôt want to trivialize it, I‚Äôm happy about that). 
No one cares or understands who I feel. If I talk about it with my parents for example my feelings get trivialized. 
I‚Äôm a pretty open guy, I‚Äôm empathetic, communicative, artsy, helpful and open minded. I have no problem talking with strangers, going to places alone or anything. I love deep talk as well as small talk (even though I‚Äôm not that good at it). When I meet someone and we hit it off I get ghosted or only one liner as answer after a short while when I‚Äôm myself. I know that I‚Äôm a bit weird and awkward sometimes but is it really that bad? 
Why can‚Äôt I find people who accept me, cared about me and support me if I feel down? I don‚Äôt ask for much. 
The friend I talked with, whom I mentioned in the beginning, is (or was) someone I thought off as a real friend. We met online but don‚Äôt live that far apart. We talked the last year almost every day and she called me a soulmate and best friend. But since she has borderline and anxiety she always said she can‚Äôt meet up. She got out of a bad relationship this summer and the first guy she cuddled with, she got immediately a crush. I was interested in her as well, but she told me because of my height she doesn‚Äôt feel anything that way. I‚Äôm cool with that, I had crushes before and I valued our friendship and after a few days my romantic feelings vanished. I helped her through her darkest times and she always said she‚Äôs there when friends feel down. Now I am down and I got only some cold messages since she is with her crush. She just left me on read this afternoon. Why can she met someone romantically, visit family and friends in different cities but can‚Äôt meet up for a coffee with me? We only met once and it went well. Now I question our friendship. Even she never showed real interest in me or my life more than some reactions when I speak about it. I didn‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúhave a fun vacation!‚Äù or ‚Äúhow was your trip?‚Äù after or during my very first trip abroad and farther away. 
Why is it always this way? Is it my destiny to die alone? Do I have to be perfect to find what I‚Äôm missing? Am I that ugly that no one wants to be around me? Am I a demon in a human body? Am I too intimidating? I worked my ass off to get to the education level I am now. I don‚Äôt want to brag but I think I‚Äôm quite intelligent. I love to learn more about anything. But apparently that‚Äôs something most people don‚Äôt care about. 
I just want to find people who want to get to know me, who care about me and who want me in their life. All that hits me like never before and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it since I have nobody to speak about it. That‚Äôs why I just had to vent here. Thank you for reading everything.

1hw73hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hw73hh/dr_lucky/,Dr. Lucky,"Prudence was five minutes late to her doctor‚Äôs appointment. It was Saturday morning, and she hadn‚Äôt wanted to go to the doctor anyway ‚Äì and she didn‚Äôt want to leave her house. She wasn‚Äôt a fan of doctors, and didn‚Äôt like appointments. But, her prescription for her thyroid medication would not be filled, the nurse had told her, unless she came in for a yearly physical (it had been two years, but they were not going to be lenient any longer). Prudence knew she needed it; her brain fog was coming back, and she was getting forgetful. She felt sluggish, and her clothes weren‚Äôt really fitting. Thyroid, menopause ‚Äì whatever it was. It sucked. But, so is life, she thought, as she walked to her car. Her moment of reflection was jarred by the incessant barking of the neighbor‚Äôs dog, Kip. Kip liked to yip, they said home. Kip barked constantly, and was always outside. She knew her neighbors were at home, but she imagined they had soundproof glass ‚Äì so Kip stayed outside for the world to hear, while they got respite in their home.

Also, Prudence had been up late last night at ‚Äúbook club.‚Äù Air quotes intentional ‚Äì they did talk about books, for about 15 minutes. Usually, right before they dispersed for the night. Most of the evening was spent lamenting the day to day of a bunch of middle aged ladies. While there were always laughs, and always some good gossip, these evenings didn‚Äôt make Prudence as recharged as they used to. Instead, she began to fret about what they would do to her sleep cycle, and how she‚Äôd tackle her ever growing to-do list the next morning.¬†

Prudence made her way to the clinic, and checked in with Tera, the receptionist. She noticed Tera looked different ‚Äì thinner maybe? Tan? She couldn‚Äôt quite put her finger on it, but she quickly made her way to an exam room ‚Äì the benefits of being a bit late. The nurse began her usual line of questioning, took her blood pressure, and then checked her current prescriptions.¬†

‚ÄúThis will just be a prick,‚Äù she said, looking up, smiling, as she took a quick blood sample from Prudence‚Äôs finger.¬†

Next was the doctor. Dr. Lucky was the best doctor in town, of which there were many. He was a good listener, patient, and just a good guy.¬†

When Prudence‚Äôs middle son, Tony, was struggling two years ago with anxiety, he developed a nervous tic; it became a verbal one, and Prudence would watch in horror as he appeared to talk in tongues at times. His actions became reckless, and he‚Äôd try to touch the hot stove or run into the street. Prudence brought him to Dr. Lucky in tears, and he calmly reassured both of them. He offered a variety of treatments ‚Äì therapy, medicine, wait and see. In the end, Tony, began taking some medication and within three days, all the issues were gone. It was like a miracle.

One of her friend‚Äôs son‚Äôs had been diagnosed with an advanced case of MS. It was a shock, and it was tragic really. Dr. Lucky researched a salve he could use, and after using it for a few months, Shane made a really drastic recovery. No one could explain it, but no one cared. He was saved.¬†

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not going to ask for ozempic,‚Äù he said as he listened to her breathing.¬†

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Prudence laughed.

‚ÄúOr an antidepressant. Asking for adderall? That‚Äôs the new one. That or hormone therapy. Hormone therapy isn‚Äôt really even a thing ‚Äì that and vitamin cycling‚Äù

‚ÄúNope ‚Äì I am perfectly content with being slightly overweight and slightly depressed. I think that is what is normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too reasonable, Prudence. I should‚Äôve known better,‚Äù he said smiling.¬†

They talked about her children, his children, busy schedules, too. Everyone was doing fine. Everything was fine. Work was work, and home was busy. The middle age mantra.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all set. I‚Äôll see you back in a year ‚Äì for real this time. Don‚Äôt make my nurse keep hounding you, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know. I just get busy, and I just don‚Äôt really feel like coming each year. I have an apple a day, I am fine with aches and pains. There are so many things ‚Äì with work, with the kids. Around the house. Things suck ‚Äì but that‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs not a highlight reel, you know? But, I will try. I will make the appointment before I leave so I can held to it. I don‚Äôt cancel things that are on my calendar.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you do really want to avoid things like this, I do have another option. It is something new. My pharm rep just brought it last week. She says it is completely harmless, has remarkable results, and should be completely approved and vetted within the next 6 months,‚Äù he said, not looking away from his computer as he completed Prudence‚Äôs chart.

Prudence paused. Where was this coming from, she thought. They had just been discussing the normal aspect of growing older and growing less enthusiastic. Embracing the suck. She had been declared reasonable, for Christsake.¬†

‚ÄúNo thank you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. Well, fine. You know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if you change your mind, call the nurse. Since I just saw you, it would be easy to set it up. Only thing is, since it‚Äôs not totally approved, you wouldn‚Äôt pick it up at the pharmacy. I have it here. So, you know, you‚Äôd have to come in, but I‚Äôd just leave at the desk with Tera,‚Äù he said, finally looking at her and smiling.¬†

‚ÄúJust stay reasonable. No one likes someone who doesn‚Äôt do as they‚Äôre told,‚Äù he said, as he walked out.

What an odd statement, Prudence thought. He had never spoken to her that way. Maybe she hadn‚Äôt noticed it before, but Prudence thought Dr. Lucky‚Äôs eyes seemed different, as he said this. She had never paid attention to his eyes before, so maybe they were always that unusual shade of gray, almost silver. Maybe it was the lights. Prudence shook the thought from her mind.

They exchanged their goodbyes, and Prudence left the room, setting her appointment for the next year as she passed by the receptionist‚Äôs desk.¬†

‚ÄúSo, are you going to take it?‚Äù Tera asked as she handed her the prescription card.¬†

‚ÄúTake what?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, didn‚Äôt he mention it? The new meds we got. I started this week, and let me¬† tell you. Everything doesn‚Äôt suck anymore! Isn‚Äôt that amazing? Like, I feel better, lost ten pounds. I don‚Äôt yell at my husband, I don‚Äôt mind making lunches or doing laundry. Everything is just easy. And, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel good.‚Äù Tera looked up expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, medicine isn‚Äôt really my thing. And, you know I don‚Äôt like doctor visits. I‚Äôm good.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Prudence quickly walked out to her car. She ran a few errands. There were groceries to pick up, a quick trip to the post office. She got a text indicating her prescription was ready, so she headed to the pharmacy. As she waited in line, she thought about the conversations she had had. It was just so strange.¬†¬†

When it was her turn, the pharmacist let her know her prescription was out of stock.

‚ÄúThis has been happening a lot, unfortunately. Good news though; we checked with Dr. Lucky, and he has a substitute you can use until we get more inventory. It‚Äôs the exact same as the thyroid medicine you were taking before, but it just looks a bit different and has a different name. He did say take two today ‚Äì right away, though, because you haven‚Äôt been taking it for a while. We put you on autofill, too. I know things get crazy,‚Äù she smiled.¬†

‚ÄúWell, thank you for taking care of all that. And, will do,‚Äù Prudence replied, sticking the bottle in her purse.¬†

‚ÄúHey, they did that to me, too,‚Äù an older man standing behind her said. ‚ÄúAnd, I love it. Best change. My arthritis is gone!‚Äù he said smiling.

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs wonderful,‚Äù Prudence said. ‚ÄúBut, I don‚Äôt have arthritis.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt matter. It just makes everything better.‚Äù

She got to her car, and took two of the small, gray pills, as she had been instructed. Though she had never taken two pills before, aside when she probably overdosed herself if she forgot she took it, she did as she was told. She trusted Dr. Lucky, even if he and Tera were a bit off today. Plus, she had to do something about this crabbiness and shortness she was feeling. Prudence didn‚Äôt like feeling this way, but she knew it was normal. Washing it down with some water, she made two more quick stops, and headed home, mentally planning out the rest of the day, which included chores, practice, food prep, and catching up on some work.¬†

As Prudence pulled into her driveway, she noticed something strange: Kip, usually a blur of energy, sat perfectly still in their yard, staring at her car. Its eyes seemed off‚Äîdull and glassy, like it wasn‚Äôt entirely there. Shrugging it off, she hurried into the house, the sense of unease lifting as she busied herself with unpacking groceries, starting laundry, and getting lunch fixed for the boys..

Her phone buzzed. It was a text from an unknown number:**‚ÄúChange your mind yet?‚Äù**

Prudence frowned and blocked the number. It had to be some kind of sales spam.

Another text. This one from the book club girls:

**‚ÄúMy head is killing me. Haven‚Äôt left bed. Who‚Äôs going to do all my laundry today?‚Äù**

Not me, thought Prudence. Embrace the suck, she typed back, and got a few ‚Äúhaha‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äì they were all in the same boat.

\*\*\*

That night, as she lay in bed, she dreamed of Dr. Lucky. In the dream, he wasn‚Äôt in his office but standing at the foot of her bed, smiling kindly. ""Everything could be easier,"" he whispered, his voice calm but insistent. ""You wouldn‚Äôt even notice the change. No more aches, no more pains. Just... *better*.""

She woke with a start, heart pounding. The room was silent except for the faint sound of her phone buzzing. Bleary-eyed, she picked it up. Another text from a different number:**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too late.‚Äù**

Prudence deleted the message and tossed the phone onto her nightstand. This was getting weird. She decided to call the clinic in the morning and find out more about whatever was happening.

But by morning, something else had changed.

The neighbor‚Äôs dog‚Äôs incessant morning barking was gone. In fact, as she looked out her window, she saw Kip sitting directly next to their fence, staring intently at her. Silently. Maybe they got one of those shock collars or bark collars. A holiday miracle, she thought, as she walked into the kitchen. Her usual morning sluggishness was also gone. Prudence noticed it as soon as she stepped out of bed‚Äîher body felt lighter, her head clearer. It was unsettling. She didn‚Äôt feel like herself, though she couldn‚Äôt put her finger on why. And, it wasn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Maybe it was that dose she took yesterday; maybe this new medication was just better. She took her gray pill, washing it down with some coffee.

Her phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with another unknown number:**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù**

That‚Äôs when Prudence remembered Tera‚Äôs words. *‚ÄúEverything doesn‚Äôt suck anymore.‚Äù*

She stopped in her place. A chill ran over her body. Had they done something to her? Was it a trick, or worse‚Äîan experiment? She tried to call the clinic, but the line was busy. She called again. No answer.

Hours passed, and Prudence couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of calm, even though she was never calm on a Sunday. Sunday Scaries were real for her ‚Äì she‚Äôd had them ever since she was a little girl. The strange lightness in her body turned into an eerie detachment, like she was floating through the day. Her kids noticed her distraction and were louder and more rambunctious than normal, but she let it pass. Her husband mentioned her blank stare. Prudence brushed them off. She was just relaxed, she told them. But, she couldn‚Äôt put her finger on it. She wasn‚Äôt panicked by all this. She was actually being way more productive than she normally was. The entire thing was just strange.¬†

When she finally drove back to the clinic to talk to Dr. Lucky on Monday morning, the building was dark, the doors locked. A sign on the door read:

**‚ÄúClosed for reorganization. Thank you for your patience.‚Äù**

Her phone buzzed one last time:**‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight it, Prudence. It‚Äôs easier this way.‚Äù**

Prudence‚Äôs breath caught in her throat as she stared at the sign on the clinic door.

Her phone buzzed again in her hand. She didn‚Äôt want to look but couldn‚Äôt resist.

**‚ÄúMake an Appointment. We‚Äôll explain everything. xxx-xxx-xxxx.‚Äù**

She backed away from the clinic, clutching her phone tightly, the screen still glowing with the message. Her mind raced. How could they know she was here? Was she being watched? And, why her? She was just a regular person ‚Äì a reasonable one, she reminded herself. Her body still felt lighter, more energized than usual, but that sensation left her feeling as though her own limbs were not entirely under her control. ‚ÄúAs if driven by a motor,‚Äù she thought to herself.¬†

This evening, she couldn‚Äôt sleep. Her husband had no trouble, and while she was usually annoyed by his snoring and snorting, she found comfort in knowing she wasn‚Äôt alone. The sound of the wind outside resembled whispers. When she finally drifted off, the dreams returned‚Äîthis time more vivid. Dr. Lucky was there again, his warm, confident smile now an unsettling mask. He stood next to her bed, holding a small vial of shimmering liquid.

‚ÄúWhy fight it, Prudence?‚Äù he said. His voice echoed in the dream, soft yet commanding. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to struggle anymore. No one does. Be reasonable.‚Äù

She woke in a cold sweat, her throat dry, her heart hammering against her ribs. Stumbling to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake the lingering unease. When she looked up into the mirror, she froze.

Her reflection stared back at her, but something was wrong. Her eyes, usually warm and brown, were now faintly tinted with silver, the irises shimmering in the dim light. Her hands trembled as she reached up to touch her face, as if to confirm she was still herself.

\*\*\*

The next day, Prudence called the number she was instructed to on her phone. Tera answered, cheerful as usual.¬†

‚ÄúHey, girl! Did you change your mind?‚Äù Tera asked.

‚ÄúNo, not at all. Look, I need to make an appointment. And, I saw you guys moved. Why didn‚Äôt anyone mention that when I was there?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes. I must have forgot. It‚Äôs been busy, you know. And, we‚Äôre busy. We‚Äôre about two weeks out. Everyone is trying to get this new medication. We‚Äôre actually having to work from an old office while we fix things up at the clinic. But, it‚Äôs right downtown. xxx Main. Will that work?‚Äù

Prudence paused. She wanted to talk to Dr. Lucky now. But, she wasn‚Äôt sick. And, maybe this eye things was just an old age thing. She‚Äôd look that up when she got home.¬†

‚ÄúNo, two weeks works. See you then.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good. I have you down. And remember, if you do change your mind, you don‚Äôt need an appointment. You can just call me, and I‚Äôll open up for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Thank you.‚Äù Prudence ended the call.¬†

\*\*\*

**‚ÄúHow are we going to make it? Bonus book club? My house? Bring wine?‚Äù**

The next two weeks went quickly, and were filled with texts like this from Prudence‚Äôs group. Luckily, there were no more texts from the unknown numbers. Prudence had blocked each and everyone of them ‚Äì someone got her number and was having some fun, she thought ‚Äì the only reasonable explanation.¬† It was the last two weeks of school before winter break. Prudence‚Äôs days were full of work, then activities. Concerts for the boys, sports practices. Potluck prep for her husband. Not to mention gift buying, and wrapping. Along with holiday cards. These weeks were always the worst. There was so much to do, and one couldn‚Äôt even enjoy it.

But, this year was different. It was busy. It was so busy. But, Prudence just sailed through. People at work complimented on how fresh she looked. Her clothes were fitting better, but she associated this with just running all over the place and actually taking her meds. The staff at her school raved about the ham and beans she brought, and everyone even got seconds during their own luncheon. Her children didn‚Äôt complain about going non stop. Her husband complimented her and showed his appreciation through words and his actions. He even began doing laundry and making dinner a few nights during the week.

The only thing that was off ‚Äì other than ‚Äúthings not sucking‚Äù as Tera had said, was the dreams. Prudence began to dream of Dr. Lucky every night. They didn‚Äôt feel like dreams. It felt like he was right there beside her bed. He wasn‚Äôt, obviously, because it would wake up her husband. But, it felt like he came to her each night, asking her questions, as he did in the office. Requesting she give this new medication a try. By the end of the two weeks, these talks had taken a turn. Dr. Lucky became angry, foreceful. One time, he had shaken her.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just not being reasonable. Prudence, you need this. Your family needs you to take this. Look how much better this break was. Just take it.‚Äù

In another, he smiled and put his hands around her throat.¬†

‚ÄúIf you won‚Äôt be cooperative, then I am going to have to call someone else in. Just be reasonable, or else I won‚Äôt be able to help you.‚Äù

She awoke each time before she succumbed to the doctor, catching her breath. She reached over to her husband, who snorted and rolled over. They were always just a dream.¬†

One would think these nights of restless sleep would start to wear on a person. But, Prudence kept on keeping on, as she had started to say. They weren‚Äôt pleasant, but they weren‚Äôt hurting anyone. And, they weren‚Äôt holding her back. They were dreams. Dreams come and go. There is always a reasonable explanation for strange dreams. Just like her eyes, which continued to shimmer with a silver glow. She could explain this away, as well. It was the reflection from the new lights in the sconce her husband had installed. Same in her car ‚Äì the silver was probably from the snow that blanketed the ground as the endured the first cold snap of the season. Everything was able to be explained.¬†

\*\*\*

Her appointment had finally arrived. As she approached the building, the sky looked ‚Äì different. It was almost as if the sun and sky were washed out. Flat, almost. That happens sometimes when the sun is low, she thought. As she crossed the parking lot, she stopped. The building, this new one, seemed to be glowing or shimmering ‚Äì metallic almost ‚Äì though made of the same old brick as many other buildings in town. This stark contrast to the watercolor sky and surroundings was unsettling. It‚Äôs the position of the sun, she told herself. This time, the building was unlocked, though the waiting room was empty, its lights flickering faintly. A low hum filled the air, like machinery working behind the walls.

‚ÄúDr. Lucky?‚Äù she called out, her voice trembling.

A figure emerged from one of the exam rooms. It wasn‚Äôt Dr. Lucky. It was Tera, the receptionist, but her appearance was different. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes shone with the same silvery hue Prudence had noticed in herself.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been expecting you,‚Äù Tera said, smiling too wide, her teeth unnervingly perfect. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to feel so much better, Prudence. You probably already do. We thought you needed a little push. You‚Äôre just so reasonable. But, you‚Äôve only gotten the tiny dose. Today, you get it all. Then, you‚Äôre going to feel so much better. Just like the rest of us.‚Äù

Behind Tera, shadows moved, taking the shape of figures‚Äîpatients, nurses, all with the same silvery eyes and too-perfect smiles.¬†

She saw the man from the pharmacy, smiling as he received an infusion of a silvery liquid, which shimmered and glowed in its bag, and appeared to illuminate through the man‚Äôs veins in his thin, thin arms. There was her neighbor, Suzanne, who was waiting, smiling, on an exam table, as a nurse Prudence had never seen prepped a syringe of the same silver liquid, and smiling, shut the door in Prudence‚Äôs face. It appeared each of the 10 exam rooms were full, and in each, someone Prudence knew was ready to be seen.¬†

Tera came closer, trying to take Prudence by the arm. Prudence started to back up, but was stopped by a tall man dressed in scrubs, who towered over her smiling. She turned to run to the exit, which was only feet away, her pulse roaring in her ears. She realized too late that the clinic door had closed behind her with a soft, deliberate click.

\*\*\*

When Prudence got home from Dr. Lucky‚Äôs, she began dinner and a load of laundry. There were moments when she felt as if she were just going through the motions, like there was some silent scream ready to leave her lips. But, she helped her kids with their homework, rubbed her husband‚Äôs feet, and read two chapters in her book club book. The laundry was done and loaded, and the boys and her husband complimented her on the dinner. There were no fights over the video games, and no eye rolls when she said it was time for bed. The feeling she had, the terror and the dread, were wrapped, tucked deep, as if enveloped in a heavy, wool blanket.¬†

As she lay in bed, she grabbed her phone, and texted her book club group chat.

**Hey there, girlies! It‚Äôs been a while. Just checking in. I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot lately‚Äîabout how hectic life gets, especially now. But something's... shifted for me.

I have 200 Westjet dollars that expire on February 17th. I will not be using it, but don't want Westjet to profit (mostly out of spite). What are some of my options. I live in a pretty remote area, so meeting up with someone to do a transfer isn't an option. What do you all suggest, I'm happy with getting a coffee and knowing that money isn't going to waste.

¬†

Henry Prince and his wife Rosie have just moved to Blue Tower, a city full of life and adventure. Rosie lived with her family in Havana until she met Henry. He and his family were on vacation, and it was love at first sight. Both Henry and Rosie are in their early thirties. The two moved to Blue Tower for Henry's new job at the power plant. While her husband is at work Rosie decides to unpack their belongings. The apartment is a duplex with a neighbor above them. While Henry is at work Rosie decides to walk around town and do some sightseeing. The city of Blue Tower is covered in smoke and fog and as she walks around the city Rosie cannot help but notice all the people with their faces covered up.

¬†

Rosie sees a fast-food restaurant called Frog Chicken and she goes inside to get something to eat. The girl behind the counter wears an orange and brown button-up shirt with a paper hat and asks if Rosie would like some chicken. The girl is a greenish pale with boils all over her face and as Rosie looks at the girl she loses her appetite. Rosie, who is a bit on the plump side orders a four-piece chicken breasts and wings with three sides. Rosie digs into her food and is disgusted by the taste of the chicken. ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE ANY CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD!"" She said. ""That's because it isn't chicken it's frog miss."" Said the girl behind the counter her face unchanged by the shocking news she just delivered.

¬†

Rosie throws the rest of her chicken out and demands a refund. The manager denies her a refund as the sign outside says Frog Chicken making it clear what they are selling. Rosie goes home and makes something sweet for her husband to enjoy for dinner. Henry comes home tired from a long day on the job, he offers his wife some frog chicken which she refuses, and he sits and eats alone in the kitchen. Henry, who is stressed from a long day at work, decides to unwind in front of the TV. Rosie tries to tell him about the strange encounter she had at Frog Chicken, but he brushes her off telling her that it is called Frog Chicken, what else could it be? The couple becomes disconnected over the next three months as Henry becomes grounded down by his job.

¬†

Rosie continues leaving the house every morning to explore the city. After her first month in the city, she discovers little Tokyo. Little Tokyo is a Japanese neighborhood in Blue Tower with a lot of delicious Japanese food and traditions. The people of Little Tokyo are kind and generous. Rosie loves spending her morning at the little Tokyo fish market. Today Rosie is picking up some fresh red snapper for her and Henry. The two haven't had dinner together in months as Henry chooses to spend most of his time either eating Frog Chicken in front of the TV or out with friends. As she is preparing the table for dinner Henry walks in with some friends from work. The two men have a greenish-pale complexion and thick bulging eyes.

¬†

Rosie asks Henry if his friends will be staying for dinner, and he responds with a comment about her weight. ""Listen here woman if I want my friends to stay for dinner it's none of your business."" Said Henry a vulgar tone in his voice. Sitting at the table by herself Rosie begins to cry. As she is crying alone in the kitchen one of Henry's friends comes into the kitchen and asks her what she made for dinner. Pointing to the fish Rosie explains that it is her husband's favorite meal. The man removes his thick black gloves, and Rosie can see his webbed fingers as he tears into the fish with his bare hands. The big man shoves pieces of fish into his mouth not accounting for any bones as he swallows the large chunks of fish whole. The man offers some of the fish to Rosie who politely refuses before he leaves and returns to the living room.

¬†

At midnight once Henry's friends have left Rosie and Henry go to bed the two sleep for about an hour before Henry gets a call and is forced to return to work. The next morning Rosie sits in bed eating chips when she gets a visit from her little brother Theo. Twenty-five-year-old Theo is a slacker who still lives with his mother and grandmother in Havana until now. ""I can't believe you're here."" She said holding her little brother tightly. ""Hola, big sister how has you been I've missed you."" He said. Theo asks his sister if he can stay for a while until he gets on his feet, and she asks him about their mother and grandmother. ""Momma remarried and grandma died almost a year ago, Momma's new husband doesn't want me around, so I need a place to stay."" He finished.

¬†

Rosie is excited to show her brother around Blue Tower. The two take the train to Little Tokyo to get some tempura and udon noodles. Theo is glad to try something new, but he does wish they knew how to make rice and beans like his grandmother. As he tries the tempura Theo loves the flavor and the more, he tries the less he misses his rice and beans. As they are leaving Rosie tells him that one of the servers is looking him up and down and her brother laughs and tells her that all women like him it is his curse. After eating and exploring the city a little Rosie and her brother return home to find Henry sleeping on the couch a bucket of Frog Chicken at his feet and a bottle of rum in his lap. ""Is everything alright with you two?"" Asked Theo. Rosie tells him everything is fine, and Henry has just had a long day at work and likes to unwind with a drink.

¬†

Rosie and Theo go to bed and sleep for the night. In the morning Theo fellows Henry to work as his brother-in-law and has made it clear that he cannot stay in his house without a job. The power plant is a massive structure with twin cooling towers on either side of a huge reactor. The men guarding the entrance are short, green-skinned men dressed like security guards. The bumpy-skinned men wave Henry and Theo into the power plant and order Henry to park his car in the auxiliary lot. After parking Henry and Theo head inside the two head to the HR department to speak with the head of HR and get Theo a job. The human resources department is full of crazy people men and women bouncing off the walls with energy as they drink gallons of an energy drink called Frog Sweat.

¬†

Henry leaves Theo to speak with the head of HR, Rick Ross and the big, Black, bald man with his gold chains and dark shades calls Theo into his office. ""So, you're the new hire huh?"" Asked Mr. Ross. Theo tells him that he's never worked in a power plant before, and he has no idea what he's doing. Mr. Ross lets Theo finish before telling him to report to the fifth floor and meet Hans the janitor. Hans is an older man with a salt-and-pepper mustache and a fading hairline. The old man tells Theo to grab a mop and help him clean the floors. ""So, this your first day, well I need you to remember one thing."" Said Hans taking a deep breath. ""What is it you want me to remember?"" Asked Theo. Hans lets out the breath he's holding and expels a massive fart before laughing at the top of his lungs.

¬†

Hans tells Theo to start on the first floor and work his way up. ""We'll meet in the middle somewhere on the third floor."" Said Hans. Theo spends hours cleaning the floor before he stops in to visit Henry. His brother-in-law is sitting in a cubicle masturbating to porn he drew himself. As he walks around the cubicle's all he sees are people slacking off and having sex instead of working. Hans catches up with Theo and laughs telling him that this is where the big bucks are. ""What do these people do anyway?"" Asked Theo. Hans explains that the third floor is where the call center is. It is the heart of the power plant, and it brings in all the money. ""These dicks just cold call people asking them if they want to switch to Froggy Power.

¬†

The entire power plant appears to be some insane asylum as no one is working and nothing is getting done. Theo asks Hans why they have to clean if no one else is working. ""Because we don't have high school diplomas."" He said. Hans tells Theo not to worry because they won't be working there for too long. Theo questions what his mentor is talking about, and Hans sends him back to work. For the next three weeks, Theo and Hans spend most of their days cleaning up around the power plant, until one day when Theo is called to the HR department. ""Maya this is Theo he's the head janitor and he'll be showing you the ropes for the next three weeks,"" said Mr. Ross. ""Can I ask what happened to Hans?"" Asks Theo.

¬†

¬†Mr. Ross explains that Hans is no longer with the company he handed in his resignation and is spending his time down south. Theo doesn‚Äôt understand but Mr. Ross appears to be done with the conversation, and he orders the two janitors away. Maya Lemon has a sweet-looking face with her caramel skin and light brown curly hair. She asks Theo how long he's been working at Froggy Power, and he tells her just three weeks. ""You've only worked here for three weeks and you're the head janitor?"" Asked Maya. ""I wasn't yesterday."" He replied. Maya is confused as to how Theo came to be in charge, but she tells him that she'll follow his orders as he is in charge. ""I want you to come with me while I clean someone's office."" He said leading her back to the HR department.

¬†

Theo and Maya wait until Mr. Ross goes to lunch before they enter his office. Walking past the deranged-looking employees that make up the HR department Theo and Maya walk into Mr. Ross's office and begin searching through his files. They search until they find Hans's file, Maya watches the door while Theo reads about Chapter 5. Chapter 5 a secret location somewhere within the power plant Theo grabs the file and the two leave. By the time Mr. Ross returns from lunch Theo and Maya have already left the HR department and are in the men's room together searching through Hans's files. Theo is shocked to learn that Hans only started working for the power plant one month before he started at the company.

¬†

Theo and Maya decide that they need to speak to someone about what is going on at the power plant and they decide to speak with Henry after work. Theo calls Rosie to ask if she's doing well and his sister tells him that she isn't feeling very well today, and she hasn't been able to get out of bed all day. Theo wants to tell his sister what is going on with her husband, but he isn't sure she can handle the news. Theo decides to question Henry before he tells his sister anything about what's going on. After work, Theo invites Maya to grab a drink with him and Henry at the frog bar.

¬†

Henry is drinking a green frothy liquor with his friends when Theo and Maya walk into the bar. The two sit at a table right next to the door and wait for Henry's friends to leave. Henry and his friends drink shot after shot of the green liquid until he passes out. Once Henry is unconscious his friends pick him up and drag him to his car. Theo asks Maya to follow them and the two head back to the power plant, where Henry's friends are pulling him out of his car. The two men then drag him into the power plant and to the fifth floor. Maya and Theo follow the two men keeping to the shadows as they don't want to be seen. ""Where are they taking him?"" Asked Maya, confused. The two men drag Henry over to a large garbage chute.

¬†

Back at home, Rosie is feeling sick, she begins to vomit and cry as if she needs a doctor. Lifting her shirt a small hand presses against her stomach and Rosie screams in horror. Passing out from fear Rosie wakes up in the hospital with a doctor she's never seen before telling her that she is pregnant. ""Doctor that's not possible I can't have children."" She explains to the doctor that she was born with only one ovary and was told she would never be able to have a child. The doctor, confused, tells Rosie that he is going to order some x-rays and blood work to verify her story and if everything checks out, he'll let her know what they can do next. As she sits in her bed crying at the thought of carrying a baby Rosie begins to wonder if this is why Henry agreed to move to Blue Tower.

¬†

Theo and Maya wait until the two men leave, once Henry's friends are gone, they see what happened to Henry. Theo calls out Henry's name and the unconscious man doesn't respond. Theo tells Maya to find some kind of rope and he heads down into the trash chute. The bottom of the garbage chute is a watery synthetic lake with stones and six feet of water. The underground lake appears to be at the lowest level of the power plant. Theo grabs Henry and pulls him up onto one of the rocks as the water begins to bubble. Poking its head out of the water a giant human-sized frog leaps onto a rock right by Theo and Henry and croaks loudly. The beast is a dark green with boils all over its skin. Theo looks at the monster and calls for help.

¬†

Henry opens his eyes to see dozens of frogmen holding spears and bows coming out of the water. One of the frogmen has a seashell horn which he blows into to play music. As the rhythmic music begins to fill the air Henry calls out to Theo telling him that he shouldn't have come to help him. ""THEY'RE GOING TO FUCKING EAT US!!"" He said crying. Theo asks Henry why he would move to this crazy city. Henry tells him that he moved here so he and Rosie could have a baby together. Theo is in shock to hear this as his sister has spent years seeing fertility specialists, all of whom told her she can't have children. Theo doesn't have time to wrap his head around what Henry just said as the frog people are moving closer to them every moment their spears in hand.

¬†

Henry gets up and tells Theo that they need to find a way out of the dump site. The two men argue about what they should do until a rope made of jackets and bed sheets comes down the garbage chute. The two men grab the rope and yell for Maya to pull them up. As the two men are lifted off the ground the frogmen rush toward them firing arrows made of gold and silver. Henry is hit with an Arrow in his side and almost lets go of the rope. Theo grabs his wrist and holds onto him while they are pulled to safety. Maya for her part is forced to pull for twenty minutes before she pulls Theo and Henry out of the Trash chute. Once reunited with her friends Maya and Theo carry Henry into one of the conference rooms to treat his wounds.

¬†

As they pull the arrows out of his side Maya can't help but notice that they are made of gold and silver. Maya goes to find a first-aid kit to patch up Henry. ""Listen to me, these monsters want to take over the world they need people like us for breeding."" Said Henry blood gushing from his mouth. Henry tells Theo to be careful because he saw how Maya looked at the gold arrow and that is how they convince people to join them. ""Don't worry about Maya she'll be fine we just need to get you somewhere safe for right now."" Said Theo. He waits for Maya to bring the first-aid kit and once she does, they begin patching him up.

¬†

Theo and Maya who are parked in the auxiliary lot, cover up Henry before driving away from the power plant. The two drive to Maya's house in a part of the city called Throgs Neck. The streets of Throgs Neck are deserted at 4 am. Maya and Theo carry Henry into Maya's house and lay him down on the couch. The two discuss what happened while Theo was down in the garbage chute, and he tells her about the frogmen. ""That's insane who the hell would believe that story?"" Asked Maya trying to figure out who might believe them. Theo tells Maya they must be careful who they trust as they don't know who is working with the frog people.

¬†

The next morning after falling asleep in Maya's bed with her Theo checks his massages and sees that his sister is in the hospital. Leaving Henry in the care of Maya, Theo tells her not to go to work today. He tells her that the two of them will call in sick and get ready to quit. Henry, still in pain, warns Theo and Maya not to quit. ""They'll feed you to the frogmen if you quit, they never leave loose ends."" Said Henry. Theo tells Maya and Henry not to worry because they will produce a plan once they have enough time to think straight. Theo leaves to see his sister, leaving Henry and Maya together for the next few hours. Maya changes Henry's bandages before going to make him something to eat.

¬†

Theo visits his sister in the hospital to discover that she has somehow become nine months pregnant. ""Big sister, what is happening to you?"" Asked Theo crying as he held his sister's hand. Rosie‚Äôs doctor Neal Patrick Harris tells Theo that his sister is experiencing a hysterical pregnancy and will need to remain in the hospital for a while. ""ARE YOU CRAZY LOOK AT HER STOMACH THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN THERE!!"" Said Theo grabbing the doctor by his collar and shaking him. Doctor Harris tells Theo to calm down unless he wants to be thrown out of the hospital and arrested for assault. Theo breaks down crying as he begs the doctor to help his sister. ""Listen if your sister is in pain I might be able to sedate her,"" said Doctor Harris.

¬†

Theo gets up off the floor and whips his eyes Rosie who is gaunt everywhere but her stomach smiles and tells Theo that she wants him to help raise the baby. ""THIS BABY IS KILLING YOU!!"" He said. Rosie, who has always wanted to be a mother, tells Theo that if he loves her, he will take care of her child and make sure the baby wants for nothing. As tears roll down his face Theo watches the life drain from his sister as she screams and doctors come rushing to her side. The doctor orders Theo out of the room and he returns to Maya's house to discover that Maya isn't home. Henry is sitting up on the couch eating a sandwich when Theo arrives. The two discuss Rosie's condition and Henry asks Theo to help him take care of his son or daughter.

¬†

Theo has so much to unpack with all that's happened to him in the past few days. Henry asks Theo to drive him to the hospital saying that he needs to be with his wife in her time of need. ""Alright I'll drive you we can take your car."" Said Theo. As he opens the door to Maya's house fifteen green-skinned men with pipes and chains bust through the back door and grab hold of Henry. Theo quickly grabs one of the green frog-like men and cracks his skull with an ashtray sitting on Maya's coffee table. The fifteen croakers are able to overwhelm Henry and Theo just as Maya enters the room. Maya is dressed in a golden dress with a bow strapped to her back. The girl smiles down at Theo and Henry who are being held down by the croakers.

¬†

Maya holds a gold nugget the size of her fist in one hand, and she slams it down on the coffee table before saying to Theo. ""This isn't how I wanted this to happen I'm sorry, but these frog people are going to take over the world anyway why not help them?"" Maya tries twice to convince Theo to join the dark side before giving up and ordering the croakers to remove the two from her house. Theo and Henry are dragged into a paddy wagon and driven to the power plant. Once they arrive at the plant Henry's wounds are treated properly and he is given time to rest. Theo meanwhile is dragged before Rick Ross and forced to answer for his betrayal. ""So, I understand that you aren't enjoying your employment here at Froggy Power."" Said Mr. Ross.

¬†

The big man gets up his belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly and he kicks Theo in the chest. ""Consider this your exit interview."" He finished. Mr. Ross grabs Theo and drags him to the garbage chute before tossing him down the chute. Down in the manmade lake, Theo is being dragged to his feet by a group of Frogmen. The pimply frog people drag Theo down into a tunnel where they command him to dig. All around him in the tunnel people are frightened and disheveled as they are forced to dig into the earth for some unknown reason. The tunnel is being dug into sections and levels with the highest-level being level 1 and the lowest being level 10. Theo is at the lowest level and as water begins to spill into the tunnel from the lake many others around him begin to drown. More than once one of the other people down in the pit with him tries to drown him so they can stay afloat.

¬†

Henry meanwhile is taken to the hospital where he is allowed to meet his daughter Ivy. The girl has green skin and boils all over her body and Henry cries as he looks at her. ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY WIFE?"" Asked Henry throttling one of the doctors. Mr. Ross, sitting in a chair next to his dead wife's body laughs and tells Henry that he's been eating too much frog chicken. The man orders the doctors to sedate Henry and take him to the breeding floor where he will be used as a stud. ""YOU SON OF A BITCH, I'LL KILL YOU!!"" Henry yelled as he was being dragged away.

¬†

Henry is taken to the hospital's mental ward and locked up with other men and women who will be used for breeding. A voice in Henry's head tells him that he is going to die so he might as well kill himself. Searching his pockets for anything he could use to kill himself Henry finds a pocketknife and some pills. Using the knife, he grounds up the pills to a fine powder and before he can take the powder up the nose the image of his wife comes to him, and she tells him that he needs to be there for Ivy. ""I CAN'T, I CAN'T PLEASE JUST LET ME GO!"" He said crying into his sleeves.

¬†

Maya Lemon is now working on the executive floor where she is surrounded by sycophants and lick spittles. Maya is second in command to the chancellor who commands the armies of the underwater kingdom. According to the chancellor, when the time comes for the frogs to rise, he will lead their armies to victory against the human scum. The chancellor is a man in his fifties with thick blonde hair and light green skin he like most of the croakers worships the god Dagon. As she surveys the power plant wondering if selling out the human race was worth becoming a servant to a race of frog people, Maya begins to think about Theo. Tonight Maya is meeting with Mr. Ross to discuss some new hires that the chancellor wants fast-tracked.

¬†

Mr. Ross is the only one working in the HR department as the rest of his team has been downsized. Maya tells Mr. Ross to fast-track the twelve hires that the chancellor wants hired but she also asks him for a favor. It takes a few days for Mr. Ross to get back to her but once he does, he explains that he can in fact get her the thing she is asking for. ""Good have it delivered to my mansion by 6 pm and be careful not to disturb my swans."" Said Maya. After talking with Mr. Ross, Maya returns to the fifth floor to receive her next assignment. For the rest of the day, Maya is allowed to sit at her desk and watch TV on her phone as the chancellor has no need of her. The chancellor goes to church to pray to the sea god Dagon that all will go as expected before going home for the day.

¬†

With the chancellor gone Maya takes her chance and goes to the lake she orders one of the frogmen to bring her Theo so they can speak. The spiky-eyed frogman does as he is told and goes to fetch Theo. Finding a beaten down and dirty Theo gaunt from a lack of food and fresh water the frogman drags him before Maya and leaves the two to speak in private. Theo who is weak from hunger can barely stand up on his own when Maya makes her offer. ""How would you like to walk out of this place and see your niece for the first time since she's been born?"" she asked. Theo breaks down crying at the thought of seeing his niece, but he refuses to owe Maya a favor, so he tells her to fuck off. ""I understand if you think I'm lying but I can assure you that Ivy is in my care."" She finished showing Theo a picture of the baby.

¬†

Henry wakes up after being forced to breed over one hundred times in less than a month. Most of the women are croakers who have green skin and pimples all over their bodies a handful are young women that range from 21-14. Henry is disgusted with himself and what these frogs have turned him into, he and the rest of the breeders are kept confined for 23 hours a day only being allowed out of their cells to shower and eat. Today Henry is sitting in the shower crying when one of the croakers tells him to hurry up so that someone else can shower. After waiting for twenty minutes for him to get out of the shower a couple of croakers with Billy clubs enter the shower and order Henry on his feet. Henry, who has a blank stare on his face ignores the two croakers and continues sitting under the water.

¬†

One of the croakers a blueish-green man with a wispy mustache pulls Henry to his feet and is rewarded for his trouble with an elbow to the face. As green blood flows from his nose the frogman's partner raises his club to attack Henry. But before he can Henry tackles him to the ground and pries the Billy club from his hand before bringing it down on the croaker's head. The croaker with the broken nose begs for his life and pleads with Henry not to kill him before he too is beaten to death. Escaping the showers naked Henry runs past almost a dozen men and women who beg him to take them with him. ""I don‚Äôt even know where I'm going."" Said Henry trying to convince the rest of the breeders not to follow him. With even more croakers coming Henry decides he might need some help escaping so he orders the rest of the breeders to arm themselves with weapons from the armory.",1,1736297096.0,shortstorywriting,0,1.0,False

I (31M) and partner (28F) - How Do I Reclaim My Relationship After My Girlfriend's 'Best Friend' Took Over or make this poly relationship ago with some rules?

My name is Alex. I‚Äôm 31 (Bi), and my wife Evie, who‚Äôs 28 (Bi), and I have been married for nearly four years, together for seven. We met on Bumble in 2017, and from the moment I met her, I knew she was someone special. Evie‚Äôs the kind of person who naturally draws people in, funny, sharp, and effortlessly cool. I fell for her hard and fast.

Early in our relationship, Evie confided in me that she‚Äôs bisexual. I was the first person she told, and I stood by her side when she came out to her parents. Thankfully, they were accepting, and it brought us even closer. Our relationship was built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect, and I always felt secure in the life we were building together.

Over the years, we would joke about her attraction to women. We would sit in coffee shops, pointing out women we thought were cute. Occasionally, the topic of a threesome would come up, but it was always light-hearted. We weren‚Äôt actively pursuing anything like that; it was more of a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù fantasy. I never felt like it was something we would actually explore.

But everything started to shift in mid-2023, when Keira, one of Evie‚Äôs new co-workers, entered our lives. Keira initially came across as friendly and confident, a typical new colleague. I didn‚Äôt think much of it when Evie started spending more time with her, grabbing drinks after work, texting more often, and occasionally inviting her over. Evie had been feeling a bit isolated since we moved in 2022, so I was glad to see her making a new friend.

When I first met Keira in person, I could tell she wasn‚Äôt just some casual friend. She was charismatic, with a natural charm that made people feel at ease. She identifies as queer (anything but straight). One evening, when we were all having drinks at home, the conversation turned playful, and we touched on the idea of a threesome. It was more of a joke at first, but there was an energy in the room that made it clear we weren‚Äôt just talking hypotheticals anymore.

A few days later, Keira approached me privately. She admitted that she had feelings for Evie but didn‚Äôt want to disrupt our marriage. She respected our boundaries and asked if it was okay to share those feelings with Evie. I appreciated her honesty. It felt like a rare kind of openness. After thinking it over, I gave her my blessing, under the condition that everything stayed above-board and Evie and I maintained open communication.

At first, things felt manageable. Evie was transparent about her feelings, and Keira made an effort to include me, making sure I never felt left out or sidelined. They started exploring their connection, which led to us having a threesome at one point. It was meant to be a shared experience, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Evie and Keira were more focused on each other than on me. Still, I tried to see it as part of our journey, something we were navigating together.

Over the next few months, Keira became a constant presence in our lives. She would come over for dinner, spend nights on our couch, and even join us for outings. By October 2024, her lease was ending, and Evie asked if she could move in temporarily. I hesitated at first, unsure of how this would affect our dynamic. But after several honest conversations, I agreed.

Once Keira moved in, our lives became more intertwined. The boundaries we had initially set became blurrier. Evie and I still had our moments together, whether it was date nights or quiet evenings spent talking about the future. But Keira was always there, an ever-present part of our household. It wasn‚Äôt long before her clothes started showing up in the laundry, her favourite snacks appeared in our pantry, and her toothbrush found a permanent spot in our bathroom.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt struggle with it at times. There were nights when I came home from work trips and found Evie and Keira curled up on the couch, or worse, sharing our bed. They assured me it wasn‚Äôt meant to push me out, and I tried my best to believe them. I knew Evie loved me, and I didn‚Äôt want my insecurities to cloud our relationship.

Things came to a head in December 2024, when we got news that should have been the happiest moment of our lives. Evie was pregnant. After months of trying, we were finally going to be parents. For a brief moment, it felt like everything would fall into place. Evie was radiant, her excitement infectious as we talked about baby names and started planning for the nursery.

But the joy was short-lived. One evening, Evie and Keira sat me down for a serious talk. Evie, with tears in her eyes, admitted that her feelings for Keira had deepened. She was in love with her, but she also insisted that her love for me hadn‚Äôt changed. She wanted to find a way for the three of us to coexist as a family. Keira stayed quiet, but her presence alone made the weight of the moment unbearable.

It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me. I was hurt, confused, and unsure of where I stood in all of this. But I could see how much Evie was struggling, torn between her love for me and her feelings for Keira. She begged me to understand, to give her time to figure things out. Despite my heartbreak, I told her I was willing to try, or her, for us, and for the baby.

We agreed to keep the lines of communication open and to set boundaries that worked for all of us. Over the next few months, we tried to navigate this new reality. Some days were easier than others. I could see how happy Evie was with Keira, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling like a bystander in my own marriage.

By the time Keira fully integrated into our lives, it was clear that this wasn‚Äôt just a phase or a temporary arrangement. Evie‚Äôs love for Keira was real, and so was her commitment to me. We even revisited the idea of a threesome, not as a solution to our problems, but as a way to deepen the connection between all of us. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it helped us feel more united, even if only briefly.

We‚Äôve had a lot of conversations about how this dynamic would work when it comes to parenting. Keira has expressed that she wants to take an active role in raising our child, not just as Evie‚Äôs girlfriend but as someone deeply invested in the family we‚Äôre building. She wants to contribute emotionally, financially, and practically‚Äîessentially co-parenting alongside us.

It‚Äôs a lot to wrap my head around. I see how much Evie and Keira care for each other, and I can tell Keira is genuine about wanting to be a part of our child‚Äôs life. Will I still feel like an equal partner? Will we be able to maintain healthy boundaries while raising a child in such an unconventional setup?

These are questions we‚Äôre still working through, but I want to give this a fair shot. At the end of the day, the most important thing is creating a stable, loving environment for our child. If we can figure out a way to make this work, with clear communication and mutual respect, maybe this can be a version of family that works for all of us.

It‚Äôs not what I imagined when Evie and I started our journey together, but life rarely plays out the way you expect. I‚Äôm learning to embrace the unexpected and focus on what truly matters: love, support, and the commitment to making this family as strong as it can be.",1,1736297092.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1hw6zqc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hw6zqc,Cooling for $150 3060 Mini Tower,"I just built this optiplex 3060 today with an i5 8500, an rtx 3050 6gb, 16 gb ram, 240gb ssd, and a 1tb hd. The only issue I‚Äôm having right now is with the heat. I‚Äôm only in like $160 total right now for the entire PC so that leaves me room for cooling. Paid $17 for the optiplex, $120 for the gpu, $1 for a power cord, $10 for a wifi adapter, and pulled the storage from an older build and it‚Äôs worth like $15ish. The CPU is hitting 95 degrees so im looking for a cpu cooler upgrade but havent been able to find what would be best since theres not much room to clear the ram. GPU maxes around 65 degrees so it‚Äôs not that concerning but better airflow would help. Currently theres only a tiny exhaust fan but i dont see a way to add an intake aside from strapping it to the front of the case on the front panel. any help would help. thank you.",11,1736297039.0,SleepingOptiplex,20,1.0,False
