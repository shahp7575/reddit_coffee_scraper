I loved the training and loved my job but the barista life was left long ago.

Just bought my first espresso machine and haven’t been in the coffee scene in years.

Need your recommendations on British local roasters who consistently deliver on unique blends that are at a reasonable produce for me to play with (£7-12 for 250g).

Happy to do a subscription. Basically don’t want to faff with the coffee itself for now and need something delicious to get to grips with my new machine.

I like medium roasts, honey or slightly natural side of funky. 

Give me your roasters!!!

1h0lfkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1h0lfkt/pinewards_november_2024_sample_set/,Pineward's November 2024 Sample Set ,"
I really love Pineward Perfumes and was looking for a good winter/holiday scent so I grabbed their November 2024 sample set. It includes spray samples of: Coffee Tabac, Mint Cocoa, Christmas Wine, Gingerbread and Glühwein. These are my thoughts after trying each both on tester strips and wearing them for a day.

Coffee Tabac: on the sample strip this basically had no scent at all. On my skin though the scent definitely popped: coffee, tobacco, warm leather and old wood. It smells like getting a cup of coffee to go with your paper at a Victorian gentleman's club. For anyone who wants to smell like an aristocratic gentleman from a period drama.

Mint Cocoa: I had already received a sample of this one so already new I liked it. The cocoa really stands out in this one tempered by the scents of wood and smoke and a little bit of spice. It smells like eating chocolate cookies next to the wood stove in the warm kitchen of a little cottage on a snowy day. 

Christmas Wine: This was the sample I was most excited to try. On the sample strip and when I first applied it to my skin it smelled exactly like what I wanted it too: warm spices and rich dark fruit with just enough smokiness to make the other notes stand out. Exactly like drinking a glass of hot spiced wine in front of the fire. However after an hour or so it dries down to a very generic ""woodsy"" scent without any of the spices or fruit notes at all. If it had kept smelling like it did when it was first applied this would have been my go to holiday scent. 

Gingerbread: I am not a gormound fan so I wasn't expecting much from this scent. On the testing strip it smelled like pure vanilla and not much else. On my skin though it was a completely different story. All the warm Christmas spices mixed with old wood, smoke, fresh fir trees and just a hint of sweet vanilla. Like drinking a big cup of the most delicious spiced tea and watching the snow fall outside while your snuggled up and warm in our little woodland cottage. This was also the longest lasting scent enrobing me in spicy goodness the entire day and also the only one my partner complimented while I was wearing it. This was the winner of the collection for me.

Glühwein: on the test strip this smelled like cloyingly sweet cherries. On my skin it also smelled like cherries and not much else. This was my least favorite of the set. ",1,1732651749.0,fragrance,0,0.67,False
1h0lfja,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1h0lfja/i_can_smell_again/,I can smell again,"I started smoking when I was 14, I am soon to be 21. I started with cigarettes, moved onto heated tobacco close to two years ago when I got sober. I'll be two years sober from stimulants and sedatives on the 15th of january. I was in active addiction for three years before that.

I decided to quit on the 13th of this month because I developed a sinus infection, right after I thought I had healed from a case of tonsillitis. I was bedridden for days and in so much pain. I was so horribly ill I felt like I was going through the same withdrawal I went through a year and eleven months ago all over again, muscle pains and difficulty breathing, a fever that never seemed to go away and horrible nightmares, constant fatigue which made moving my arms to do so little as take an ibuprofen feel like the chore of the century. I had to take two sets of antibiotics in the span of a month's time. And with this I missed so many classes in university, and a couple evaluations also.

Typically I would smoke regardless of whether I was ill or not, but this time it was particularly bad, as previously described, but not just that. My mother said something to me, which she had already said before and others alike and it is common knowledge and I knew it as well but I guess this was the first time I really took it seriously, which is, smoking does make me far more prone to infections and it is likely the reason I am more frequently becoming ill.

Despite having cut my daily consumption in half I was still smoking a pack daily. But, well, that was that, I just stopped on the 13th. I got rid of my things and stopped. Cravings suck, but they don't suck enough to push me into smoking again. However I do often feel unsatisfied after a meal or after I have had coffee. Yesterday I actually found myself scratching my head at the fact that I needn't go outside in between classes to smoke, I shared this with a classmate and she found it hilarious.

Either way I feel very confident and I have a strong will to quit and never touch a cigarette in my life again, specially with all the great things that I have seen and felt happen since.

My skin and my lips are no longer dry and flaking, they feel and look plump and smooth when not long ago my cheeks and jaw felt like sandpaper from how rough my skin's texture was.

I can walk for longer and move far more in general without getting tired immediately, it never really ocurred to me that walking shouldn't feel like I'm dragging myself everywhere, I feel more capable.

I have also not been anxious at all, in retrospective I think it may have been the thought of ""I need my next cigarette"" that was making me unreasonably anxious, because I was the kind of person who would open a pack already thinking of when and where I was going to buy the next one.

But I think what has touched me the most so far is that I never noticed how dulled my sense of smell had become. I walked outside and I still had a bit of a runny nose when I noticed this, but the street didn't just smell like garbage or ""nothing"". I could smell clean clothes and the bread from the bakery and I could smell the food in the isles of the market! Which speaking of, I decided to cook once I felt better and now I can smell what I'm making for more than a few seconds when I first heat up the onion and garlic! I can smell my food throughout the entirety of its making without having to literally stick my nose in the pan and I'm so excited about it!

I have also come to notice that I did cook with a tad more salt and pepper than I was probably supposed so I have been going easier on them and using more aromatic seasonings instead, my food has been the best lately. 

It helps that my partner doesn't smoke either, he quit just a few years ago as well, and I think that helped nudge me in the right direction, though he never said a thing or made any judgement about me smoking. In general, he has just been the best, his unconditional acceptance of who I am has helped me to look forward into the future, be less anxious, go back to doing all the things I love (and stop biting my nails in the process). I made friends who like me and care about me and are safe to be around and consistent, which is also really great and helpful.

Focusing on all the positives of sobriety helped me a lot to stay clean the first time around, so I'm doing it again, it's still very early but I like it a lot.",1,1732651746.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False
1h0leke,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0leke/somewhere_in_nowhere_the_rot/,Somewhere in Nowhere: The Rot,"[When](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gz028c/somewhere_in_nowhere_eggs_and_apples/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I was a baby, I had borderline insomnia. On the nights mother was desperate, she would bring me out onto the porch, and within minutes of basking in the starlight, I would be asleep. That’s how she used to tell it, anyway. 

It explains why every time I stand on this porch, even during my watches, I feel some level of comfort. Parts of myself are so deeply ground into this house that I can feel it beneath my skin when the old wooden bones creak in the night. 

It had been a few days since I’d first met the beast that haunted my dreams and also that weird cow thing. The rain earlier in the week had somehow left the ground much drier once it all evaporated, and the animals were dustier than tofu in an abattoir. There wasn’t a cloud in sight that morning. As much as I would’ve liked to waste the day away on the porch with a glass of Aunt Jean’s anomalously acquired lemonade, it was Barnyard Bath Day. 

I put the chickens in Bath Jail (a puppy pen placed nearby so I could keep an eye on them, with *Bath Jail* scrawled on a cardboard sign and a shallow pan of warm water inside) and tried to decide who would be my first victim. Either Aunt Jean or a very ineffective cow thief had already brought Milkshake and Dairy Queen to the barn. I ultimately gave in to the fact that it would be best to do the most difficult of my clients first. 

It took three sugar cubes just to get Hephaestus out of the barn and another to keep him from running off when I turned on the water nozzle. He wasn’t scared by any of it; I would’ve found a less obtrusive way to bathe him if he had been. He was just annoyed, like he was with pretty much everything. A bastard, for sure, but a bastard I couldn’t imagine life without. 

Hephaestus, nothing if not predictable, took a solid hour and a half to bathe and another hour to brush out, mainly because whenever I lifted the brush and started to walk off, he would grumble at me. When he was clean, I walked him to the pasture to get some of his energy out and dry off. Then, it was time to reopen the car wash.

Sally, seeing clear evidence that it was Bath Day through the open barn door, stood in the doorway, bleating at me. I knew that the cobwebs on the barn ceiling were a menace, and she was always keen to get her orange hair scrubbed out and brushed.

“Do you want to go next, Miss Sally Ann?”

*Bleat.*

“Oh, I bet you do. You’ve been visiting the roofboards more than usual. I bet you’re Dirt City.”

*Bleat.* 

“Come on over here then, Sally Ann Thunder Ann Whirlwind.”

She yelled at me one more time before trotting over. She enjoyed Bath Day the most and would even let me polish her hooves. Her husband, though… he was an entirely different story. Davy Crockett was big and bad enough to send Black Phillip running back home to his Lake of Fire. And he wasn’t afraid to tell me how much he hated his bath. I almost got a foot right to the face. 

When they were done, I sent them out to the pasture with Heph. Milkshake and Dairy Queen always had to be bathed together. I had never thought that cows could have such extreme separation anxiety before I bought Milkshake. Cows need companions, and my steer French Fry had passed away from old age. I’d gotten her in town for ten dollars, and when I asked why she was being sold for such an insanely low price, the man simply replied with “cow broke” and invited me to lay a hand on her. She was constantly emitting gentle vibrations like she had an engine inside of her. But if she was a robot, she was a convincing one. I named her Milkshake.

If you saw Dairy Queen, you saw Milkshake, no exceptions. They were inseparable. Maybe they were best friends, maybe something more. I was in no place to judge a lesbian cow. 

The last two to be bathed were also a unique challenge. My sow, Hermia, was old and patient enough. But her son, Hamlet, couldn’t stay still to save his life. The little piglet had always been a piglet. 

I asked my dad about it once when we’d kept more pigs. He’d just said, “Little hen, he can’t change who he is any more than we can change who we are. Maybe he just can’t bear to get old.” That was enough of an explanation for me. Not everything needs a reason. Sometimes things just *are*, and that’s alright in my book.

Getting Hamlet bathed always ended with me drenched, and that time was no different. When mother and son were finished, I looked like I’d taken a leisurely stroll into the Amazon Rainforest. Hamlet gave me the most generous thank you of burping in my face before getting the zoomies the second I put him down. 

Once everyone was clean, the sun was already half-hiding behind the treetops. I ensured the Girls were warm and dry after their stint in the bath pan, then cleaned the coop. Hairy had the decency to respect the sanctity of Bath Day, and back in the hens went once it was tidy. I got all the animals back to their designated places, made sure they were fed and comfortable, and then I went to take a bath of my own. Dawson was coming over, and I’d be damned if I let that asshole call me smelly. 

I ran the water as hot as it would go and scrubbed until my already-aching hands cried out ‘no more.’ When I got out of the bath, I was a little wobbly. Instead of realizing how dehydrated I was, I chalked it up to the usual fatigue of a hard day’s work and went to the porch. 

The sun sank behind the pines. Dawson would be here any minute, so I sat down to wait for him. I’d invited him over to watch something with me. I’d meant to start it, but I didn’t trust myself to finish shows on my own. Almost immediately after I sat, everything started to turn bright yellow, and I passed out.  

At some point, lost consciousness turned into groggy half-awareness, then dreamless sleep. The memories of being awake were vague: someone forcing my mouth open, water and oatmeal, and a knitted blanket thrown over me. It wasn’t hard to guess later who it was; only one of the likely suspects was present.

When I woke up, it wasn’t on the porch or even in my bed. I was lying face down in the dirt, and a worm was putting its blood, sweat, and tears into trying to crawl into my nostril. I tugged it out and flung it somewhere into the cornfield surrounding me on all sides. 

A strange smell clogged my mouth and nose, and it wasn’t just worm. It also wasn’t the bloody footprints surrounding where I’d woken up, the massive kind with only one definitive source, even though I could definitely smell the sweet iron. No, the foul smell plaguing me came from the corn itself. On close examination, I could see where the bottom of some of the stalks had turned withered brown and even gray. The sight and smell both meant one thing: death was sure to follow. 

I got to my feet, panic slowly building in me. All I could think of was losing most of the crop. Sure, I got what I needed to survive from the Landlady. But the farm couldn’t function without the money I earned from the harvest each year. Just as I’d decided that was my biggest problem, it was immediately dethroned. 

In the moonless, faint dark of early morning, I saw a wave of grimy black mold sweeping across the ground toward me. I nearly tripped on my own feet as I stumbled back through the row. It followed me until I reached the edge of the field, and then it stopped. I thought that maybe it wouldn’t leave the cornfield. Maybe it couldn’t.

I took a shaky backward step toward the house. The black began to burble like bogwater, almost as if I’d made whatever it was angry.

“Oh, you don’t like that do you? Well I’m gonna go get in my comfy bed and you can stay out here with the Pigman. How about them apples?”

The bubbles solidified as *something* crawled out of the ick. 

This is probably one of the worst times to step back from the action, but I have to share a memory first. When I turned double digits, my mother had a brief but intense “aliens are real” phase. She had a lot of special interests like that. I remember sitting in our living room, patching one of my favorite pairs of jeans, while my mom watched a documentary about Roswell and alien sightings in the Midwest. My mom changed the channel when they started talking about cow mutilation, but I’d seen enough. 

What I saw crawling out of the black was reminiscent of the foggy, gruesome images that memory conjured. Its lower jaw hung loose and broken, missing most of the skin. The right side of its face clung to its skull in bloody shreds, and it had only one cloudy, cataract-filled eye. It huffed as it moved jerkily toward me as if every step caused it great pain. The white speckled along its black coat was not bicoloration but large patches of pale mold. 

I was honestly a little pissed that I was in a standoff with this thing when I could be fast asleep in my cozy bed. Zombie cows were not a planned part of my hot gender-fluid summer. 

“Nice… nice cow. I don’t want any trouble. I bet you’d like some corn, wouldn’t you? Why don’t you just stay out here and have all you want? And I’m going to go back in the house!”

I was about to turn and run for the porch when my foot caught a pothole. I fell right on my ass into the dirt driveway, and then that was when the buzzing started. I could hear flies and feel them trying to crawl in my mouth and nose, even though nothing was actually there. 

“Get the fuck away from me! Go back to Hooven Hell or something!”

The rotten thing moved much faster now that I was down, and its breath smelled like moldy milk carpet. I held my breath, kicked my leg up as hard as I could, and was rewarded with a shower of cold cow intestines all over my knees as its stomach burst like a water balloon. Somehow, it didn’t seem to mind being gutted. It thumped a hoof down hard on my chest, and the air shot out of my lungs with a hacking gasp.

Its own intestines snaked up and out of its open mouth, snapping around my throat, and whenever I ripped one off, another took its place. I kicked and thrashed and finally realized that maybe I should be screaming for help, so I did. If this thing wanted me as its girl dinner, I wouldn’t make it easy.

Just when my vision was darkening, and I could feel its flat, cracked teeth against my nose, we were both bathed in harsh light. I turned and saw a truck barreling down the road toward me and my new friend. It closed the distance at full tilt, horn blaring, and the cow thing released its grip on me and sprinted back into the cornfield. 

I collapsed back onto the ground, and the tires of the red Ford stopped about a foot from my face. My unlikely savior jumped from the truck, with it still running, and scooped me up out of the dirt. Without a word, Dawson threw me in the passenger seat and got back in on the other side, locking the doors.

“Are you okay?!”

I was. I mean, I was definitely a little worse for wear. I couldn’t think of a time I’d ever smelled this bad. But I was alive. And if Dawson hadn’t shown up, I probably wouldn’t have been. As much as it annoyed me to admit, if this had happened even a week ago, I would’ve been burnt toast. But I didn’t tell him that. He probably already knew anyway; it was so stupid how smart he could be sometimes.

“I’m fine. I probably would’ve been a lot more fine if I’d fallen asleep watching Good Omens last night with *someone who was supposed to be here sooner!*”

Dawson sheepishly drove us the short distance back to the house.

“I know, I know. I didn’t just ditch you, I swear! I was coming to apologize, actually. I brought breakfast.”

That’s when I realized what the smell that was slowly invading my nostrils and replacing all the bad ones was. There were few things that could smooth over anger like a greasy McDonald’s breakfast. 

“Well, you’d better have a good excuse.”

Dawson looked around nervously and turned off the truck.

“I’ll tell you all about it, let’s just… get inside. I don’t know if that thing is gone! Oh god, my mom is going to kill me when she finds out I didn’t turn around and speed out of here with you.”

I glanced around before opening the door and making a beeline for the house. Dawson followed with the food, and I let him in first before slamming the door behind us. I wasn’t too worried about anything going after the animals, not yet, anyway. Davy Crockett had enough old man rage to level a building.

“Do you… do you have any idea what that was? Because I don’t. All I’ve got is an undead cow, which… doesn’t feel right.”

Dawson shook his head.

“Bad news is what it is. I’ve only ever gotten the feeling I got seeing that once before. It’s something evil.”

I sat down as Dawson laid out breakfast. Even after what I’d just been through, my appetite was still very much there. I swallowed a mouthful of half-chewed pancakes.

“What did you see?”

He got this deer-in-the-headlights look. 

“When I was little, my family and I were visiting relatives on the Res. I saw something one night, something I shouldn’t have— something evil. My mom doesn’t really like me talking about it with strangers… or with anyone, really. It’s not that I don’t trust you, of course; it’s just…”

“No, no. I get it. We all have to have some secrets. Sometimes, it’s safer that way. Do you think this is the same kind of… thing?”

By now, dawn was breaking, and seeing the first light made me feel worlds better. I had never seen the Pigman during the day, and even if the two weren’t related, it inspired some confidence in me. Monsters didn’t like daylight, right?

“I don’t think so, but it’s nothing good either way. Could we… maybe change the subject, though? At least for a little while?”

“Well,” I said, moving onto the impressive amount of hash browns he’d brought, “we could talk about how you stood me up last night?”

Dawson sighed and drenched his pancake in syrup. After we finished eating, I would have to do my rounds. Even if I was a little angry at him, I was glad to have him here for when I had to go back outside. 

“I was just getting ready to leave when my dad called me to the barn. One of our ewes went into labor, and I… I spent the night elbow-deep in sheep vagina.”

“Sheep vagina?”

Dawson laughed, but it was nervous.

“Yep. I would’ve much rather been elbow-deep in a bowl of popcorn.”

I laughed, too, but for much longer. Then I realized I couldn’t stop. I threw my hands down on the table and cackled until tears sprang up in my eyes, and they decided that this was their party now. The massive hoofprint bruise hiding beneath my shirt ached as I sobbed. 

“Oh, Newport. It was a rough delivery, and by the time mom and baby were situated, and we were done, I went inside and passed out on the couch. I should’ve at least texted. All this is on me. Fuck, I’m really sorry.”

I shook my head and got up from the table. Dawson followed me as I grabbed my shotgun and walked out onto the porch, still unable to stop the tide of tears. 

“It’s not that, Dawson. I don’t care about you playing ovine obstetrician. It’s just…”

It was just that I was terrified for the well-being of myself and of my home. It was just that this rot creature didn’t fit in with any of the usual oddities on the farm— it was dissonant and evil and I could feel in my bones that it wouldn’t be gone for long. It was just that I’d come close enough to death to feel its maw against my face. 

It was just that Dawson had saved my life.

“I’m just worried. Really worried.”

Dawson had been following me around like a puppy, but I heard his footsteps distinctly stop then.

“Hey.”

I turned and looked back at him. He had an expression I’d never seen on him before: stony seriousness. 

“It’s okay to be worried, but it’ll be alright regardless. I can tell this place means a lot to you, and we won’t let anything threaten that— or you.”

Dawson put both hands on my shoulders, and in the firmest, no-nonsense voice, he said:

“Fuck that zombie cow. He’s a little bitch.”

Just like that, he had me laughing again, and this time, the tears didn’t come back. He dropped his hands and smiled.

“Knew I could get you to laugh.”

“Oh my god,” I said, wiping my eyes, “just walk with me. I need someone to share my last cigarette with before I roll some more, and I’d rather not find out if Mr. Night of the Living Beef is a smoker.” 

Dawson started following me again, but this time he kept pace. I lit the cigarette and offered it out to him first. By the time we circled back to the porch, all that was left was smoke on our breaths. 

I heard him walk into the house, but I stayed, making sure the shotgun was loaded and looking out over the path. I could still see the deep tire tracks from when Dawson slammed on his brakes if I squinted. 

“What’re you doing?”

I didn’t take my eyes off the road, but a smile crept over my face.

“You’ve got your secrets. I’ve got mine.”

I gave it exactly ten minutes before standing and turning back. Dawson was watching me, and he probably had been the whole time.

“Keep your secrets,” he said with a dumb grin, “just come finish breakfast with me.”

So we sat in the kitchen together and finished our McDonald’s on chipped china. It wasn’t often that I got fast food like this, and even with it having grown colder than a banshee at her ex’s wedding, I still ate every bite of it.

“So, I’m going to make us some coffee if I can figure out the caffeine dinosaur you’ve got over there.”

He was right. That coffee machine looked like it jumped out of the fifties, but I’d never gotten a better cup anywhere else.

“And then we’ll figure out what we should do next. I would call my mom and ask her, but… I don’t feel like the Mom Voice this early.”

I picked up our plates and looked over where Aunt Jean stood by the hissing coffee pot. 

“Someone beat you to it.”

Dawson caught my gaze and jumped a little when he saw her.

“How did she get down here? I didn’t see her or hear her come down the stairs. Did you?”

“Nope. If you’re hanging around here, you might as well get used to it. Sometimes she’s just… there. And then she’s somewhere else. But her teleportation has never been particularly malicious.”

Aunt Jean walked over and handed him two things. The first was a cup of coffee, which I was expecting. If she had spoken, she would’ve said something like, “Guests always come first in this house, chickadee.” The second was an ice pack.

“Thank… thank you, Aunt Jean. It’s really nice to meet you properly.”

Aunt Jean took on a serious look. She gestured to the ice pack, then to me, before holding both wrinkly hands on her chest. It took Dawson a minute to register the message, but once he did, he came over quickly and with visible concern.

“That thing hurt you bad, didn’t it?” 

The soreness and pain that I’d been trying to ignore for the past hour flared up at his words, but I did my best to deny it.

“I’m fine, I swear. Just some bruises and things I’d have to talk to my therapist about if I had one.”

“I don’t believe you. Take it.”

I stared at Dawson, and he stared at me. Neither of us was backing down— that was until Dawson cheated.

A hard poke in the chest was all it took for me to wince and mutter “fuck,” and Dawson shoved the ice pack into my hands. 

“That was totally unfair, you know that?”

“Yeah, I know. Now ice that.”

As uncomfortable as the chill was, I gave in and stuffed the ice pack into my binder. Seeing that Dawson had won the Ice Pack Battle, Aunt Jean walked over and pinched his cheek like he was an adorable baby. Then, for the first time ever, Aunt Jean spoke.

Well, that’s not totally right. Her mouth formed the words, but the voice that came out of it definitely wasn’t hers. It was a little girl’s, spoken like a child would talk to a dog.

“Good boy!”

I watched Dawson’s cheeks tinge slightly red.

“Yeah, I… I do my best. Someone’s gotta make sure they take care of themself.”

Aunt Jean’s smile widened before she approached me and placed a steaming mug in my hand.

“So we’re feeling talkative today, Jeannie?”

She reached out and gently patted my cheek. I caught the scent of Dove soap, and then she was gone. 

“She’s… quite the character, isn’t she?”

Dawson turned to me and grinned the same dumb grin he got whenever he was proud of himself. It annoyed me how easily I’d come to recognize it in the short time we’d known each other.

“She really is something. I think she likes me.”

I took a sip of my coffee. It was burning hot, but I was still shivering from the ice pack, so a warm stomach for a scalded tongue was a fair enough trade. 

“Don’t get a big head over it. Aunt Jean likes everyone. Well, most everyone.”

Like the bastard he was, Dawson walked over and started washing our dishes from breakfast. It was only two plates, but I was still ready to kick his ass over it. 

“I see where you’re coming from. But let me ask you this. Has she ever spoken to anyone else besides you?”

I wasn’t about to tell him she *hadn’t* spoken to me. I would’ve been jealous, except for the fact that I wasn’t. Aunt Jean and I had a special bond, and I almost always could sense what she was thinking. Words are loud and unwieldy sometimes, and there’s a certain dignity and comfort in quiet companionship. 

“Touche, asshole.”

“Maybe she likes me better,” he says, using that tone of voice that tells me he doesn’t actually believe that but wants to annoy me. 

“Maybe you can take a nice, long walk right into the Grand Canyon.”

“I bet I’d do a good job being you. Couldn’t be that hard, though I might go bankrupt on overalls alone.”

For a moment, I actually wondered if Dawson would do a good job running the farm. All signs pointed to no, but I didn’t necessarily see it as a bad thing. Keeping this farm from going to shit is a difficult job, and it’s made me a hard person. I wouldn’t want that to happen to him. Plus, there’s not much McDonald’s breakfast out here. Or that cereal he really likes. I wasn’t sure I’d like the person Dawson would become if he spent that much time around here.  

“Oh, please. You’d be running out of here in less than a day with your tail tucked between your legs and Davy Crockett hot on your ass.”

“Oh, really? Well, I’ll have you know that your horse likes me better!”

I gasped in mock outrage. I was almost certain that wasn’t true, but I respected the spirit of dramatics.

“How dare you! A curse on you! A curse upon your house! A curse upon your cow! A curse upon your—“

I was interrupted by the Hamster Dance. Dawson and I glanced at his phone, which lay on the table. The screen lit up with the word “Mama.” 

“Looks like your curse worked,” Dawson said with a dry laugh, “oh, she’s going to kill me.”

Then he answered it. The yell that came out of that tiny speaker could’ve been heard clear across the state. There’s no force greater than a worried mother. Other than her yell, all I heard was Dawson’s side of the conversation.

“Yes Mama, I’m fine. No, I’m not outside. I know there’s something bad out there. Yeah, I know, you always feel things like that.”

I snuck into the next room, far enough to be out of the way but close enough to still hear.

“No, Mama, I don’t have it, but— I can’t just leave! Newport will be here all alone and that thing might come back and— no, Mama, it’s not like that! They’re just— Mama, I can’t leave them like that, and... fine. I’ll… I’ll try. But I don’t think it’ll work. I know Mama, I know you’re looking out for me. I love you too.”

After a few minutes of silence, Dawson joined me in the living room.

“Heyyyyy. So—“

“Not a chance. I’m not leaving this farm while that thing is out there somewhere. I don’t think Davy can hold his own for that long.”

Dawson sighed.

“I knew you’d say that. I tried to tell her. But she’s going to have my ass if I don’t go get some sort of protection from her. I usually have my necklace, but I was rushing out, and I forgot it today.”

I picked my shotgun up again from where I had laid it and peeked outside. The sun was warming up the fields, a gentle wind blew through the cornstalks, and I could hear the yellowhammers as they went chee-chee-chee-*squeeeee* amongst the trees. It was turning into a deceptively beautiful day. 

“She said if I want to stay with you, she won’t stop me as long as I get something to protect us. But I’m not leaving you here without a way to go. You can keep the truck, I’ll… well, I’ll walk.”

A gruesome picture invaded my brain at Dawson’s words: him walking down the path, and before he could even make it out of sight, a black and rotting blur tore out of the cornfield and slashed into him, spraying bright red blood everywhere and putting on a gory horror show worthy of an A24 flick.

“No. You’re not walking. If you want to leave me the truck, fine. I won’t argue with you on that. But we’re going to find you a better way out of here.”

I didn’t give him any time to disagree. I just snatched his wrist and pulled him out toward the barn. 

“I already know my truck isn’t going to work. It needs a new radiator and I can’t get one until next month. The four-wheeler has been slow lately, and I don’t think we should take that risk. Um…”

Dawson walked over to the horse stable, just like I was afraid he would. I would’ve rather he rode Beelzebub.

“What about your horse? I’m sure he’s fast enough.”

I scratched the back of my head. Hephaestus could be pretty rough when he wanted to be.

“I don’t know…”

Hephaestus narrowed his eyes at Dawson, but he reached out to scratch his snout. 

“Alright old man, I know you don’t like me. But let’s have a truce for now, okay? I’ve gotta get where I’m going.”

To my surprise, instead of shooting out and snapping at him like the feral dog he was, Hephaestus closed his eyes and sighed. If you’ve never heard a horse sigh in content, I feel sorry for you and recommend you go find a horse at your earliest convenience.

“You do like him better, you bastard!”

Heph actually rolled his big horse eyes at me, like *I* was the dramatic one out of the two of us.

“I wouldn’t take it personally. I’m just the cool uncle.”

I walked over and grabbed the saddle, thrusting it into Dawson’s hands.

“Well, let’s see if the cool uncle can get his saddle on with all his fingers intact. Do you know how to ride a horse?”

Dawson gave me a tilt of the hand that inspired so little faith.

“I know all the basics, but it’s been a while since I’ve actually used them— like… years.”

I pulled out a carrot I’d forgotten in my pocket and had him give it to Heph, hoping we could buy his patience. 

“Well, all I can tell you is good luck. You’re probably going to need it. Time for the saddle.”

To my surprise and continued annoyance, Dawson got it on pretty easily. He’d passed the Horse Test now, too. In fact, all the animals besides me had adjusted to his presence like he’d always been here. Having him around still felt so weird, but the idea of him leaving felt worse than that. It felt bad. I didn’t like to think about it for long, because then the questions I didn’t want to answer started to surface. 

“Look at me, I’m a natural!”

I was brought out of the haze that was beginning to consume me by Dawson trotting around the barn on Heph. Both looked very pleased with themselves. I could tell Dawson was expecting me to come back with some smartass remark, and honestly, so did I. But whatever I would’ve said stayed lost in the useless hunk of meat that was my brain at the moment. 

“Come back, okay?”

Dawson pulled Heph to a stop and stared down at me.

“Because… if you or Heph get splattered across the dirt road up here, it’s going to attract crows, and they’re totally going for the corn next. And that would be… super lame.”

I hated the way Dawson’s expression changed. It got softer, and his eyebrows pinched together. 

“I’ll be alright, Newport. I promise.”

I just shook my head and looked away. 

“Who else is gonna make you pull that annoyed face you’re pulling right now?”

If he had been beside me then, I would’ve for sure taken his tree branch elbow to my ribs. As I turned back to him, I almost felt it telepathically. 

I gave him what some might’ve called a smile. I hated how it sat on my face; it reeked of worry. And my concern for his well-being was none of his business. 

I led Heph out of the barn door, stopping just short of it. The sun was hot, and the air was filled with the noise of Mother Nature, totally unbothered. But with the feeling in my stomach, it might as well have been the deepest depths of night.

“Nobody would do it better. Keep your eyes out for… that thing. I don’t think it’s scared of the daylight, Dawson.”

He nodded, and I laid my hand on Hephaestus’ flank, silently pleading for the old stallion to keep his cargo safe. Then I slapped him on the behind with a ‘hiyah,’ and he tore down off the dirt road with Dawson.

“Look at me,” I heard him yelling as they rode away, “I’m riding a fucking horse!”

I had a sneaking suspicion that he had lied about his history with equestrians, but it seemed like he was managing regardless.

“Don’t yell like that! You’re ringing the damn dinner bell!”

It was hard to tell from how far down he had made it, but I swear he turned back to look at me and winked. I sighed, shook my head, and went back into the barn.

Usually, the animals ate before me, but today hadn’t been a usual day thus far, and my money was on it staying that way. Still, I could tell Davy was getting crankier than an old man who hadn’t gone to bed by seven.

After everyone was fed and seen to, I went inside and made sure all the doors were locked. Then, I treated myself to a decadent lunch of a handful of Cheetos from the bag I picked up in town. The Landlady rarely brought me anything besides healthy food and fresh ingredients, so it was my duty alone to treat myself. Then, I went to shower. I was only just remembering that there was still dried cow gunk all over me. 

When that was done, I busied myself with household chores as best I could. I kept Kurt Cobain’s voice rattling out of my stereo as high as it would go, trying to fight off the nervous *something* that was threatening to crawl up my back in every single moment of silence. I dragged my dustbuster all over the house, glad that I’d finally broken down and gotten Two Tooth Steve to order me a Dyson using just a little of the liquid cash I kept in the lockbox. I tried to be very careful with what I used that money for, but a man can only bust the dust for so long. My days of bunnies under the bed would soon be no more.

Afternoon crept into evening, and something in me knotted up when I had to flick the porch light on. I’d gotten no word from Dawson, not even a text. Not that there was much service out here. Aunt Jean stood by the kitchen window, staring into the gathering darkness. It was hard not to join her, but a nagging feeling in my gut told me that’s what it wanted.

It all suddenly made no difference when I heard Dawson calling my name outside. I was too relieved to think straight for a few seconds, and that was all it took. I threw open the door and raced off the porch like there were springs in my feet. I scanned down the long, lonely path to the main road. Dawson was nowhere to be seen, but I did hear footsteps behind me. They were slow and disjointed. One, two, onetwo, one… two… onetwo, onetwo, one, two… one…... onetwoonetwoonetwo—

I wheeled around as the Rot picked up the pace, sprinting toward me as much as a festering cow carcass could. Broken bone shone white in each of its legs. I staggered backward, with my mind screaming all the while to turn around and run like hell. But everything felt like jelly. The Rot’s gory jaw fell open, letting loose a death wail. Then it closed in on me, coming in for the kill. I shut my eyes tight. 

I expected to hear the squelch of my flesh being ripped off or the wheeze of its breath right against my ear. I wish I had, because what I actually heard was a million times worse. There was the sound of broken footfalls passing me by and Dawson yelling my name. This time, it was actually him.

I watched his smile fall into a look of unabashed fear in real-time. 

The world was suddenly on fire. The feeling of slogging through a jam jar was gone, and suddenly, every move was at warp speed. I was on the porch, off the porch, halfway down the road, sprinting so hard my legs stung. My shotgun was in my hand. When did I grab it? 

I was getting there, but not fast enough. Heph let out the most terrified whinny I’d ever heard, and from where I was, I could see the panic in Dawson’s wide eyes. The Rot was a few more strides and a claw swipe from going all ominous unknown killer on my horse. Everything was a blur of motion after that. The WiFi signal to my consciousness must’ve been extra shitty that day. 

There was a loud crack and Dawson was on the ground and Heph was running back toward the barn without him and Dawson was clutching his wrist to his chest and I was lifting my gun and the Rot was leaning over him and its intestines were wrapping around his neck and *BANG*.

Time jerked to a halt. The Rot wobbled slightly, a massive hole blown into its meaty skull. I didn’t move or even breathe while waiting for it to fall. The only sound was Dawson whimpering quietly.

I shot it, and now it was over, right? Right?",1,1732651680.0,nosleep,5,1.0,False

My dad said he used to have a machine back in the 90s so he's at least familiar but I have no idea to what extent (could have just been a nespresso pod machine...). I'm trying to decide whether to go with a fully automatic machine w/ built-in grinder vs. semi-auto with separate grinder. (specifically, Breville Barista Express VS Gaggia Classic Evo Pro + Breville SmartGrinder).

Someone near me has a Barista express new in box for $450, so that is tempting. But I feel that it will get heavy use and the Gaggia is a better, more durable machine from what I read. I don't feel like the fact the gaggia is semi automatic will be a big deal as I think they'll get into it and learn how to pull shots quickly. But also considering MAYBE they will find it too tedious to use and would better appreciate the simplicity of the breville.

Appreciate any thoughts or recommendations!

However, guests that left my property yesterday burnt the shit out of the coffee table and rug underneath it, from smoking in the house (it’s a non smoking property). The smoking is a whole separate issue, but my conflict lies with requesting funds for the coffee table and rug which probably total around $800 to replace. 

My thoughts are this- my property has a 4.99 star rating which as we all know is nearly impossible to maintain since there is always the random outlier who is happy but still leaves 3 or 4 stars. I have been extremely lucky to not have many guests leave 3-4 stars and I am worried about requesting the funds and in turn getting a retaliatory bad review. Does anyone here know how hard it is to get Airbnb to remove retaliatory reviews? Do you all still requests funds for damages anyways and just say screw it?

Whether you’re spending it with family, catching up on sleep, or just enjoying the silence of no students shouting your name, here are a few tips to help you truly unwind:

# 1. Set Boundaries with Work

* Leave the grading and lesson planning for *after* the break. You deserve a mental reset.
* If you have to get work done, set a specific time limit, like 1 hour, then close that laptop guilt-free.

# 2. Move Your Body

* Take a walk after Thanksgiving dinner or try a quick yoga video on YouTube. Even 10 minutes can do wonders for clearing your mind.
* Bonus: Fresh air = instant mood booster!

# 3. Practice Gratitude

* Take 5 minutes to jot down things you’re grateful for. It could be as simple as “my cozy blanket” or “my morning coffee.”
* Shifting focus to the positive can be surprisingly calming.

# 4. Make Time for YOU

* Read that book you’ve been meaning to get to.
* Watch your favorite comfort show or movie without multitasking.
* Take a nap. No guilt allowed!

# 5. Try a Digital Detox

* Put your phone down (unless you’re doomscrolling Reddit, of course 😉).
* Even an hour unplugged can help you recharge.

# 6. Indulge in Some Self-Care

* Light a candle, run a bubble bath, or do a face mask.
* Whatever makes you feel pampered, go for it—you’ve earned it!

# 7. Connect with Loved Ones

* Whether it’s family, friends, or even your pets, enjoy some quality time with the people (and creatures) who lift you up.

We are a group of five students from Germany, Finland, and Poland currently in Ljubljana, Slovenia working on a podcast project exploring the topic: *""Why did Starbucks fail in Australia?""* Our focus is on analyzing the cultural aspects that contributed to the challenges Starbucks faced in establishing itself in the Australian market.

To gain authentic insights, we’re seeking input from Australians who can share their perspective on the country’s coffee culture and provide thoughts on why Starbucks struggled to succeed.

We’ve prepared a brief script with three questions that invite your personal opinion. Ideally, we’d love for someone to record a voice message answering these questions, which we could feature in our podcast as a guest contribution. Alternatively, if you’d prefer, you can share your answers in text form. We’d also be open to conducting a short interview if anyone is interested, though we understand that might be asking a lot.

If you’re a coffee enthusiast and would like to participate, please leave us a message here on Reddit.

Thank you so much for your time and support—we really appreciate it!

Have a great day!

  
EDIT:

Questions:

1. How would you describe Australia’s coffee culture? Do Australians spend a lot of time enjoying coffee, or is it more about grabbing a quick takeout? Is coffee seen as a chance to socialize in a cozy setting, and how important are service quality and the overall experience?  

1. Australian consumers generally prefer local cafes over international chains. Why do you think local cafes resonate more with Australian consumers than Starbucks?

I'm trying to replace my Dell XPS 15 (9500). It's been great but due to different reasons I need to upgrade it. I'm hoping to find a good deal this coming Black Friday or Cyber Monday. I'm located in the US.

About Me:

* I'm a data analyst/scientist, I often deal with big data sets and have to run big transformations or even run multiple sub-process to speed up some data handling. If I have to do a huge task, I will rent a VM and run it there.
* I use Windows and use **WSL** to run some Linux tasks.
* At home I run a 3 monitor set up, with external mice and keyboard. I will connect my laptop and have the lid closed.
* I do some light gaming but nothing that requires high specs: Thing along the lines of WoW (classic) and  MapleStory (dont judge).
* I work on some **very simple** Fusion 360 projects for 3d printing. Nothing big.
* I take my laptop to coffee shops or even on trips out of town, so something light is always nice.

Requirements:

* I'm used to a 15inch screen. 14-16inch screens can work.
* The design has to be professional looking (elegant), I don't want it to scream: GAMER HERE. I often meet with clients so a elegant looking laptop goes a long way.
* 16gb of RAM is the bare minimum, it would be nice if I could upgrade it in the future if I need to.
* A dedicated graphics card. I sometimes run models on my GPU, also for gaming purposes. Doesn't have to be a powerful GPU that handles extreme loads.



Laptops that 'fit' the criteria and I've been looking at:

* Lenovo P16s Gen 3
* Lenovo P1
* Lenovo Yoga 9i
* Asus G14/16 (Zephyrus)



I'm open to other suggestions, these are just the ones I've looked so far and 'fit' the bill. Any help is greatly appreciated!

","A few of years back, I went on a Bumble date.

We had call first to discuss what we both was looking for.

I told him that, I’m not thinking about marriage right now, I’m also not interested in casual things like hookups.

>

So, I was clear and told him I’m looking for a nice, genuine company to do simple things with, like going to the movies, grocery shopping, or just hanging out on weekends, like friends — since I don’t really have friends to spend time with.

He agreed and said he was looking for the same. So, we decided to meet up.

We met and after just five minutes, he asked, “Why don’t you do casual stuff?”

I replied, “Casual stuff as in…?”

He replied, “Like hookups and all.”

I said that I don’t find any sense in it.

It’s not about character; I don’t judge anyone who does hookups — they have their preferences and opinions.

But for me, it doesn’t feel right, and it’s hard for me to reach that level of comfort with someone where I’d consider getting physical.

I told him this politely.

Then he asked again, “still, what’s wrong with it? Isn’t it convenient?”

I answered, “Maybe, but I just don’t want it.”

At that point, he started explaining the “benefits” of casual hookups — how you can get your physical needs met without worrying about commitment or relationships.

He said things like, “There are physical needs, and it’s important etc”

I sat quietly for a moment, then asked him, “Why did you ask me to meet?

Just to convince me about the benefits of hookups?”

He replied, “Yeah, kind of. I thought I’d give it a try”

He then added, “Why does it matter? You just have to sleep with someone once, and that’s it.”

At that point, I stood up to leave. But before I did, I asked him one last thing:

**“Imagine you’re very thirsty, and there’s no water bottle or store nearby.**

**What would you do? Would you wait until you reach home or a store, or would you drink water from a dirty drain or sewer?”**

He answered, “Of course not, I wouldn’t drink from a dirty drain or sewer?”

I said, “**Exactly. That’s what I’m doing right now.”**

And then I just left — I didn’t even have the coffee. Seriously, why don’t people respect others’ time?

He asked me to meet just to “give it a try”.

So it’s now over eight years since I finished my back-to-back 5 day courses of Cipro in the first half of November 2016, and it seems time to check back in, provide an update, and also some thoughts from someone who’s been around and actively engaged for quite some time. I will recap some things people often ask about, but I have already thoroughly written up my story(1) and provided various updates(2,3,4) since, as well as a few detailing flare-ups (5,6) and recovery therefrom (7,8,9), and posted about some key supportive interventions (7,10,11), so, should you have questions, please read those first.

This post is long and broad. Generally, it frustrates me when posts of this breadth and magnitude are made without warning since they make moderation rather hard. I have tried to steer clear of dropping any risky bombs or pseudo-recommendations without exposition, keeping it to more nebulous topics, but I have ran this past other moderators before posting nonetheless.

There will also be a few comments with my moderator hat on, so if you’re an active member here I’d ask you to have a read if you have the time. Perhaps shouldn’t hide them in here… if you’re only going to check a small part, please scroll on and check sections on ‘mental health’, ‘anti-medicine’, and ‘interventions’ at the end.

 

**… TL;DR? My closing thought?**

If it weren’t for this community, I would likely have all but forgotten my post-flox identity. It does still govern what footwear I buy and the injuries I incurred along the way do place some limitations on me, but it doesn’t get a moment’s thought in my daily activities where it previously did for a good five years, in one way or another (don’t worry, only 12+6 months of that was acute phase).

“One flox-friend once told me that we were necessarily <60 members strong when I joined. We have grown by a factor of 100 since and we have a steady influx of terrified individuals as well as a subgroups of high-sufferers, mentally unwell, strong-willed thinkers and frightened followers. We *must* be careful with the things we say and critical about the things we read. We have a peculiar condition, one for which there isn’t a firm understanding of all the ins and outs. However, there is still established truth in this world, both in our own contexts and in the broader sense.

It is clearly evident that Floxies see recovery, that time is a key player in getting us there, that some things help but almost never themselves cure. There are doctors out there who are clearly awful, others who are like wolves in sheep’s clothing, but there are also surely more doctors who care deeply, and a few who are potentially worth seeing if one finds oneself further down the line and struggling. There are people online who seem to have understood things, people who know they haven’t, and also those who think they have but are spreading dangerous pseudoscience or conspiracist rhetoric.

Above all things, fact check for yourself.

 

**The recap, with a focus on doctors:**

The first course I took was a prophylactic for a needless procedure, all prescribed by a urology specialist (Dr U.) who fully dismissed my concerns. The second as I had weird ‘possible UTI’ symptoms and my PCP \[fairly rightly, imo\] stuck to what the urologist had prescribed, although not without a raised eyebrow. I don’t really blame my PCP at all, but I do quietly resent the urologist. I do not, however, hold on to that resentment, and found that focusing on rage and hatred only made me feel worse.

About two months after, I started to show symptoms: I ruptured a tendon in my hand while climbing, I began to tear at the insertions of both Achilles. My PCP had no idea what was happening but was happy to file my requests for referrals. The first orthopaedic specialist (Dr O.) I saw at the University Hospital gave me an MRI and was exceptionally dismissive about what I was experiencing, stating it could not be the medication I’d just taken. I argued – pleaded, more like – and he summoned his foot and ankle expert, who was a lot more apologetic when he said, “There are some minor damages, but I see no reason for you to be in the pain you describe.” The first guy I also quietly resented, such callous arrogance, but humans be ignorant and arrogant and it was easy to just cut these morons out of my life. He got me into physiotherapy and I was to come back after a couple months. …

So I started physiotherapy. By now it’s probably four months in and, where initially it was just the pains of physical damages, now it was also the more extensive and permeating pains or burning, ripping, pin-pricking,… My PTs were truly amazing. The lead lady listened very attentively to my story, the bits I’d learnt through reading, and went away to read further herself. They had dealt with FQT sufferers before, knew it could be a thing, just none experiencing anything much like I was (yay!). We discussed the useless orthopaedic and they offered to exercise their right to refer me to their own doctor (Dr A.) and, through him and an additional contact of his (Dr B.), further up to the regional specialist (Dr C.) they knew had dealt with folk like us. I have a deep and lasting love for these PTs.

However, in spite of the physio, I continued to deteriorate. Dr A. prescribed me an orthopaedic boot to tick his box of “I tried” so that he could ultimately refer me on to Dr C. Well, this made me worse, and the changed gait and strain, as well as the ankle being held at a greater angle, resulted in extensive fraying of both Achilles. This was confirmed by Dr B. who, as his part in the referral process, had decided I needed a steroid injection to the bursa in my ankle. I of course flagged the contraindication, but “it’s in the bursa, it will be fine”. This was performed guided by ultrasound and he was audibly surprised at the condition he found the Achilles, prompting a check of the other leg: “Wow, they go all the way up! I’ve never seen anything like this. Fascinating”, he exclaimed while showing the students in the room. This procedure didn’t destroy me, I’m pleased to say, but it did leave that ankle a \*lot\* more sore for many, many months. He also prescribed gabapentin, which didn’t do anything for me. I never went back to him and mostly forgot about him. Silly man. (Around this time I also took oral amoxicillin (Augmentin) for an inner ear infection without any issue.)

Cue Dr C., \~six months in. By now, I had performed a more extensive literature survey on FQT, key known and proposed mechanisms, and what I might do to support / manage / heal that. He listened to my story, agreed with my assessment and, although we discussed things like surgery and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) treatment, apologised that there was nothing he could honestly do to fix me, only support me while I wait it out. Where Dr B. had laughed at my discussion of supplementation, Dr C. nodded along and was broadly in favour of the effort. He prescribed me some snazzy carbon fibre braces (I had Thuasne SpryStep Plus, and know of at least one major competitor, the AFO Blue Rocker, to show my financial impartiality) to isolate my Achilles /ankles and allow them to truly rest. He called a pause to my physio (a shame since they were a very real support to my mental health at this stage but a warranted move) and I took to rest. I think he anticipated 3 months of those, but it was more like 9 before I was fully out of them and my legs were incredibly wasted by the time I got back into physio at the 1 year mark.

Returning to physio at the 1 yr mark, things were different now. I made noticeable improvements. My recovery from there was surprisingly rapid at first and by around 15 months I was noticeably more mobile, out of the braces by 17, and doing 10 mile cycles by 19. Glorious.

My point here is to say that I understand the drive to find someone to heal us. I also understand the resentment people feel against their doctors. However, as I’ll come back to shortly, I don’t believe there is even the understanding of our condition enough for doctors to be much help, yet certainly there is the understanding to say they can do us harm. That said, I want to stress that they do that harm through ignorance, not malice. They are also accustomed to seeing hypochondriacs with too much access to information who presume their reading surpasses the doctor’s years of education and experience. While this may well be true for some of us, this is not the true in the general public, and so we are met with scepticism. Some of us here really need to hear that *there is no great conspiracy*. Although it may make us feel better to think this was someone’s explicit fault and that they should be hated for it, that doesn’t serve us. Hate and resentment are stressful emotions and I firmly believe that letting go and moving on is integral to a holistic recovery and the overcoming of trauma.

 

OK, recap over. Some comments from my lofty vantage point.

**Relapses:**

Resuming my recap for a moment, 22 months in, I suffered a major relapse. This was seemingly triggered by over-exercise and a sudden turn in the weather. Experience tells me that they could come from anything or nothing alike and I don’t always think stressing over identifying it to be helpful. Nevertheless, in my case, I had clearly pushed too hard, too fast, and this set me back a pretty long way. I was promptly back in significant pain with renewed limitations to my activity levels. However, I healed up from it and, by the time that ‘mini-recovery’ had completed, I was further forward than perhaps I would have been otherwise.

I had a range of flares across my recovery, generally reducing in severity and duration but not completely. I have identified my major triggers to be cannabinoids, with stress and the cold being other but much lesser triggers. One thing that remained was that, once the initial onslaught had passed and recovery began, it was always faster than the first time around, and when it got to its end it seemed to stop and have advanced my overall recovery.

 

**Timelines and predictions:**

My story was a slow burner, taking two months to show any clear symptoms, “new symptoms” coming and going with “new pains and damaged” happening for another six months before it remotely stabilise. Others come in hard at the start and then just ssllloooowwwwwly diminish. Some rise up fast and hard, stay there a short while and then just sort of clear up. Some bubble in a low sense for a week or a year and then dissipate or blow up. People regularly ask us what to expect but, after around 7 years here (previously under a different name), all I can really say to that is, “one day, you will almost certainly improve”. There is a statistic of 14 months mean recovery time from the FDA. I have mixed feelings about this, personally, and suspect it to be significantly skewed by the nature of the reporting involved but it is what we have. Just like we have stats in the scientific literature for various symptom cluster likelihoods in the range 0.01-2.0% (although I don’t personally think these improbable). As much as some people may suggest or quote folk saying other numbers, these are what we have.

I digress. The point I was getting at is that we are all each very, very different, and we cannot compare ourselves to others. My story is unique, just as is yours; the report you see above is very unlikely to be what yours will look like in its specifics. Similarly, recovery is an insanely non-linear beast, occurring often in jumps forward and steps back and down-times and sunny periods. It can be incredibly cruel in the hope it gives and takes, in the way at first it taunts us like a rollercoaster that threatens to be over before a blind drop and a new loop. But, of course, it can also begin tomorrow and just do its do and be done. There is no knowing what specifically the future holds, and happier is the Floxie who deals only with today, preparing for tomorrow but not stressing out over what it may be.

 

**Mental health and suicidal ideation:**

Which leads me to mental health. We have had a fair few reasonably extreme posts in this context of late and one of our new mods has prompted a re-evaluation of how I handle them, but I wanted to come to this properly.

Around 10 months in, I was succumbing to the depression. My psychiatric symptoms had been \*relatively\* minor, but things had been bad enough for long enough that I had lost all hope. The online communities I had access to harboured loud voices proclaiming eternal suffering and damnation. I’d suffered more ruptures, my pains had continued to grow and so too had my limitations. I won’t go into the thought processes that led my there, but I recall a moment of dawning realisation that suicide was the logical course of action and I contacted my mother to explain my plan. We talked and I agreed to see my PCP about antidepressants. Two days of Wellbutrin later and I’d decided that misery was better feeling like a robot and I stopped. But, to keep my agreement with my mother, I took up microdosing magic mushrooms.

This marked something of a turning point for me. I was no longer struggling to survive it but was keeping a promise to my mum that I would give my mental and physical health the best shot at recovery and to enjoy whatever I could in life \[“while demonstrating to her that I was a hopeless case” (sic)\]. I also began to cut back on weed and moved my coffee steadily back in my morning to around 2 hours in. I would sit in the garden with friends and neighbours, or even just at the window, sometimes being taken to a park and left on a bench to read and watch the world go by while others explored. All of these changes – both chemical and perspective – combined to significantly improve my mental state.

Suicidal ideation is something toward which the floxed brain is chemically disposed, even before considering the damages to our lives in the present, the perceived loss of futures, the isolation and rejection, the pain, … This is further compounded by the information they access online being necessarily biased toward the extreme by the nature of self-reporting, and the population of the online communities being implicitly self-filtered towards the longer, more severe cases. Suicide is truly the single greatest threat to a Floxie’s life, and yet it is perhaps the most avoidable.

For this reason, we (r/Floxies) absolutely \*must\* be careful of what we say around the newly floxed, the fearful, and the suffering. We have allowed Rule 3, “No Uninvited Scaremongering”, to slack in its meaning in recent years. Recently, one of our new mods in particular has been enforcing this and I am 100% on their side here. This isn’t to say you cannot post about your struggles or discuss them with others, but it is to say that we must not pile in on particularly Newcomer, Pre-Flox, or Mental Wellbeing posts with comments like, “I took two pills and now I’m in agony.” If you cannot provide a constructive, productive, and supportive exposition then just don’t comment.

 

**“99+% and counting!”:**

I am glad I didn’t give up when my brain decided it was time to. I am now fundamentally fully recovered.

OK, I’m telling a fib there, but an intentional one. Recently, we had a post that was targeting our claims of “complete” or “90%” recoveries. At first, I actually would have agreed with them. I’m a professional academic scientist and I deal with quantification and error margins all the time. To put a number to something so qualitative seems utterly ridiculous on the face of it. … But does it, really? It tells you how well the individual perceives their life to have recovered and, since life is itself a ludicrously subjective experience, isn’t that what counts?...

My neuropathic pain is gone – completely gone – and has been for a couple years now. My tendons are no longer brittle in the way they used to be. Activity no longer results in the burning agony or ‘sand-on-glass’ sensations it used to and I haven’t managed to cause a relapse except by smoking weed since I was about 4 years old (heh, funny, the way we speak). I am recovered.

But, at the same time and in addition to things I’ll mention in the next section, I have existing health complications. My GABA system remains more prone to withdrawal, my health more susceptible to stress, some strange intolerance of vapes and pesticides and ambiguous VOCs. But I have a history of benzodiazepine abuse, I have lived an exceptionally high-stress life the past few years, and I have been exposed to many chemicals that cause sensitisation. So is it fair to count these in my recovery stats? I am also now almost a decade older and have not made significant further efforts to rehabilitate my body while, pre-flox, I had the physical fitness of a man in his mid-20s who  had been exceptionally active and decently healthy ever since childhood.

Perhaps “99+%” would be my honest answer, but I consider my flox recovery to truly be complete. That said, in merely living my life, as I have been doing the past few years, through travelling and working and seeing friends and not accepting limits, I am very evidently continuing to recovery. Recently, I ‘ran’ maybe five minutes across Amsterdam Schipol Airport. Two years ago, it was a landmark achievement to successfully run for the bus.

I have recovered; I am still rehabilitating. I do not consider myself special.

 

**Regrets:**

So my ‘floxedness’ is pushing an asymptote toward 0% and I am getting stronger and more capable as the months go by, … but I have been left with limitations. These have come from the injuries incurred along the way. Particularly, ligament damage in my left foot, rupture of my posterior tibial tendon and (tangentially related) breaking of the outer two toes on my right side mean that I will likely never be able to get properly back into running. Rupture of the tendon(s) in my hand(s) also means that, to climb, I need extensive taping of my fingers. These injuries were absolutely avoidable, incurred as a direct consequence of my refusing to accept my \[temporary!\] condition and the fight to find some form of salvation.

So, if I had to live this all over again, I would want someone to tell me that it was largely a waiting game. That my condition today isn’t necessarily reflective of my condition tomorrow, and neither is this month reflective of next. I would want them to explain that prevention is better than cure, and that I should probably not keep climbing and running, despite the fact that I’m not exhibiting any significant symptoms. I’d want to be told that doctors aren’t likely going to save me any time soon and, in all likelihood, simply can’t. I would want someone to convince me that time and patience truly are my best best.

I doubt I’d listen to them. As if I hadn’t already learnt my lesson from Drs U. and O., my efforts with Drs A. and B. absolutely made my case unnecessarily worse and contributed to these lasting limitations, and I pushed through easily six months of tears and ruptures before I truly got the memo. Still, a man can dream.

 

**Silver bullets and explanations:**

Which leads me to the point that there truly are no silver bullets for most of us. We go through cycles here of individuals actively seeking The Answer™ to our condition, promoting a new (or re-vamped) fad for healing, or claiming to have found The Cause™ to our problems. Some of these do genuinely help some people, and some of these may well be a portion of the condition, but my Two Cents? There is no The™.

The science puts a few clear markers down: topoisomerase (mitochondria), oxidative stress, MMPs, collagen synthesis; neurochemical signalling systems (GABA and NMDA in particular but also notably dopamine and serotonin) and possibly demyelination; cyp450 inhibition. The community’s (better) prominent doctors further speculate MCAS and immune mediated aspects that are becoming quite plausible as long-term complicators. The topic of ‘metal chelation’ comes up a lot and is discussed in the literature here and there. I cannot deny it is likely taking place, but I do not tend to think it a sufficient or necessary component and do not have a feel for whether or not that which is necessarily taking place is likely to cause harm.

The community’s more controversial doctors promote other ideas that I do not feel are at all supported by science: fluorinated medicines are not toxic because of the fluorine they contain but because of their molecular action, and neither do they provide fluoride to the body (see post (12); consider also the toxicity of base quinolones vs. FQs next time someone tries to tell you otherwise); ‘leaky gut’ is a fringe idea at best and fails to explain a swathe of our issues; oxalates I’ve been caused to think twice about but note that the scientific and medical community remain sceptical. I would note that there is merit to the idea of ‘replenishing the microbiome’.

But this leads me to note that the most any doctor can likely do for most of us, IMO, is (a) diagnose /rule-out further complications or damages, and (b) provide physical interventions, psychiatric medications, and disability notes. Any doctor claiming to have The Cure™ should be viewed with extreme caution, particularly when they charge thousands of dollars for a consultation. Most of them are just selling the supplements, protocols, and knowledge discussed freely in places like The Sticky. I do perceive some who may be worthwhile visiting for the longer-term Floxie, but I don’t really think this warranted in the first 12-18 months.

But, what do I know, I’m just some dude on the internet, a man with scientific training in a thoroughly adjacent field.

 

**Anti-medicine:**

Tangentially related, it makes some sense that Floxies would find themselves distrusting of doctors; “once bitten, twice shy”, as they say. However, as much as we should learn something about the fallibility of man and the merit of self-advocation from our experiences, I do not feel anti-medicine positions to be the answer. I have taken a veritable pharmacy of drugs post-flox and, although some folk flare, yes, perceive that to be the exception not the rule. Only to insufflated Fluticasone steroids have I had a reaction. Do I make sure to quiz doctors about the risks and their motivations to prescribing? Heck yeah! But do I turn my nose up to antibiotics, antifungals, vaccines, …? Nah. Heck, I even use steroid creams, albeit tentatively at first.

I actually tend to think that the outspoken, anti-pharmaceutical, anti-western medicine rhetoric of flox communities is a major disservice to us. Not only do I think it objectively dangerous to our individuals’ health, it undermines our credibility to the general public and doctors alike. For reasons in this vein, we have discussed clamping down on it here.

 

**Interventions and words of warning:**

So, I’ve done some nay-saying, what can I say that’s positive for us? Well, I am confident in saying that antioxidants supported my health through my recovery. Specifically, I found combining N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) and Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) gave meaningful symptomatic relief and seemed to help sustain my recovery, and I think this is readily supported by the scientific understanding that \[almost\] exists. I got a similar degree of relief and recovery support from supplementing magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). The latter was supplemented alongside vitamins D and K to help it move around my body. Meanwhile, I broadly supplemented B vitamins (yes, including B6) which seemed to improve energy (shocking, I know) and mood alike. I took a bunch other things (discussed before(1,4)), but these were the ones that seemed to actually do stuff.

However, this was not without risk. Long-term antioxidant use is reported as having a number of possible risks, and particularly supplementing Ca is known to raise chances of various heart problems down the line (besides obvious kidney stone risks). Nothing we do is without risk and it is important that we consider these and acknowledge then whenever we discuss our choices with the frightened. Compression socks and ankle braces have also been utterly pivotal in my comfort, damage limitation and recovery, but even these are not without consequence, yielding potential weakness and muscle wastage, for example.

I am as guilty as the next of us for not mentioning risks, more so in the past, because I considered the need for health, comfort, and quality of life in the present to be more important than risks in my old(er) age. Nevertheless, I need to make sure that I always put sufficient effort into my contributions here, not just saying things like, “Calcium helped.” And, since we expect this of me, we must hold this bar for us all.

 

**OK, I think I’m done now:** 

If you made it this far, I must applaud you. This took time to write but surely will take time to read. To those of you who carefully contribute to supporting the community and its unfortunate slew of sufferers, I say thank you. Just as I say thank you to the moderators and key players, past and present, who have helped us grow something here. As much as I deal mostly with the rough side of the sub in my role here, I do see and notice the good. You make my life a lot easier, and surely bring peace and hope to others’.

 

Peace and love, y’all,

He wasn’t just firm. He was heated. Most people might’ve gotten angry or defensive. Not me. You know what I felt?

Why? Because that call told me 3 things: 

1. He’s ambitious. He cares about his dream so much he’s losing sleep over it. 

2. He trusts me enough to handle something that’s so important to him. 

3. He’s holding me accountable. Not to just get it done, but to make it great.

So I (23F) have been living in an apartment on my own for the last year and a half and have been in a relationship w my boyfriend (22M) for almost 2 years. He has lived with roommates for the last 4 years or so, and just moved back into his parents house a few months ago. 

We have just recently started discussing the possibility of moving in together once my current lease is up in the summer, but there is one consistent issue that is making me hesitant about it: He really struggles to clean up after himself, and I feel like I can’t ask without it becoming an argument. 

Because I live alone, we often end up hanging out at my apartment to be able to have privacy. He tries often to “make things easier for me” by picking up dinner, making tea before bed, coffee in the morning, etc, but would leave a mess from the act. For example, he would bring food over, and all of the takeout bags and trash would stay on the counter until I went to work the next morning, and ultimately I would have to clean it up otherwise it wouldn’t get done because he says he would forget. 

I started to just get exhausted, as I started a new position at work and am putting in much more hours away from home and late nights. Now, I have started to just remind him to put things away, like “hey you left the milk out of fridge” or “can you please put away what you pulled out in the kitchen” and it is almost always met with me being told I am mean and talk to him like he’s stupid because I ask him to do these things. I explained that I already work full time and have to do these things for myself every day, so it’s exhausting to have to do even more of it, and he told me I am rude and treat him like an idiot. I tried to communicate that I appreciate when he tries to do things for me, but it always ends up becoming a chore because I have to clean or fix whatever was disrupted, to which he answered that he just won’t do anything nice for me again. He told me he feels like I’m nagging and he would do it if I could find a kinder way to tell him, by being gentler, thanking him for what he does, and in general tiptoeing around the ask, which I feel like is coddling and not helpful for him to truly be able to do things independently without me asking. I told him eventually I want to not have to ask in the first place, but apologized that the way I ask seemed too harsh. 

I do really love him and want to move in together, but I don’t know how to get over the hurdle of cleanliness. Is my approach too harsh? Any help is appreciated.

Background: I'm a 30 year old male, only child, both of my parents have been borderline hoarders for my entire life. Not to the extent that the house is not able to be navigated, but to the extent that all cupboards, drawers, dressers, closets, storage spaces were bursting at the seams and very unorganized. The basement and two car garage absolutely stuffed with things from over the years. 

My dad passed in January of 2023. So now it's just myself and my mom. As I said I'm an only child, we don't have any extended family, or anyone close that's really able to help or make a huge impact. Her neighbors are very helpful and help her take trash to the curb / mow her lawn free of charge. As I live about a half hour away and I'm able to visit once or twice a week with my schedule. 

In July of 2023 I took a week off work, and we filled two average sized dumpsters with stuff from the garage / basement and it's now mostly cleared out. Ever since my dad passed she has been in a major depressive episode, she deals with her own health issues and has some limited mobility although she can walk short distances without issues. It's been almost two years since my dad has passed and her mental state / behavior surrounding taking care of herself and her main living area is not improving. 

Every horritzontal counter top in the house is absolutely covered and filled with random things, from the kitchen counter tops / island / kitchen table / dining room table / buffet cabinet / coffee table, to the bathroom sink /night stands in the bedroom. She doesn't seem able or capable mentally to clean up, organize or maintain a healthy living area for herself and im at an absolute loss as to how to get her moving in the right direction. Any time I'm over here and try to get her to help me clean her areas, she tells me she's exhausted and has no energy to do so, she is not in disagreement that these areas need improvement and need to be cleared / cleaned  but she has really not taken any steps towards doing this herself. When I visit it's very minor improvements or one area is a bit better with another area worse. She doesn't work, she doesn't drive. She is just at home all day with nothing to do. Even if she spent an hour a day cleaning and organizing and then actively tried to maintain her progress there would be noticeable improvement in a week or two. 

What plan of action should I take, we live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, she obviously needs some form of therapy / counseling / mental health professional.. but is there any one that specializes with in home cleaning and organizing that can spend some time with her or help her with this? It's getting to a point where I can't allow her to live like this much longer, if we can't get it turned around, I don't feel comfortable with her cooking, eating, bathing or existing in these kinds of conditions, she is going to trip and fall, get some form of illness from unsanitary kitchen or bathroom areas... my main concern is for her health and well being. I want to keep her in the house if at all possible. But it doesn't seem as if she has the faculties to do this on her own.

She is not obstructive to the process, she's just not capable. Any suggestions of what I should be looking for as far as professional help, or if I should focus on mental health first before the household.. I just need to get this in the right direction before I have to make a decision to move her out and burn the house to the ground. Thank you in advance.

Mental wellbeing isn’t just about avoiding stress—it’s about thriving in your daily life. While grand gestures are great, it’s often the small, consistent habits that truly transform how we feel. Here are some lesser-known tips to boost your mental health:
	1.	Practice Micro-Gratitude ✨
Instead of listing big things, try appreciating small moments—like the smell of your morning coffee or the warmth of the sun. These tiny joys add up!
	2.	Digital Declutter 📱
We always hear about decluttering our homes, but what about our phones? Unfollow accounts that don’t inspire you and reduce screen time to give your mind a break.
	3.	Set “Worry Time” ⏰
If anxious thoughts take over your day, set aside 10-15 minutes to focus on them. When worries pop up outside that window, remind yourself to wait until “worry time.”
	4.	Create a Joy Jar 🎉
Write down things that make you happy, no matter how small, and put them in a jar. On tough days, pull one out for an instant mood lift.
	5.	Find Your Sensory Soother 🕯️
Discover a smell, sound, or texture that instantly calms you—like a lavender candle or your favorite calming playlist. Keep it handy for stressful moments.
	6.	Unplugged Walks 🚶‍♂️
Leave your phone behind and take a walk, even for just 10 minutes. It’s a great way to clear your head and reconnect with your surroundings.
	7.	Celebrate Small Wins 🏆
Don’t wait for big milestones to celebrate—acknowledge every step forward. Whether it’s making your bed or finishing a small task, it all counts.

So, here’s the deal. My (34M) now ex-wife (33F) and I had what I thought was a *solid* marriage—two kids, a nice house, matching coffee mugs, the works. But last month, I bought a *Brush Up*, the foldable, pocket-sized, eco-friendly hairbrush everyone’s been raving about. Honestly, it was life-changing. My hair? Immaculate. My confidence? Through the roof. It’s not *just* a brush; it’s a lifestyle.  

Anyway, one night, I come home from work and notice my Brush Up isn’t on the counter where I always leave it. I start looking around, thinking maybe one of the kids moved it, but then I spot my wife—*using it on the dog.* THE DOG. My 12 Euro, limited-edition, recycled fabric masterpiece, covered in dog fur. She didn’t even clean it afterward, just tossed it back like nothing happened.  

I was *livid*. I calmly asked her why she would disrespect the Brush Up like that, and she rolled her eyes and said, “It’s just a brush.” JUST A BRUSH?! That’s when I realized we were fundamentally incompatible as people. How can I stay married to someone who doesn’t understand the value of good hair hygiene and quality craftsmanship?  

Long story short, I filed for divorce. Now she’s telling everyone I “threw away our marriage over a hairbrush,” but honestly, Reddit, it wasn’t just about the Brush Up. It was about what the Brush Up *represents*: respect, boundaries, and commitment.  

AITA?

We kept exchanging looks and smiles throughout, and I even caught him glancing at me a few times. Whenever I caught his eye, he’d quickly look away, like he didn’t want to get caught.

At one point, I smiled directly at him, and he blushed a bit—it was honestly adorable. I felt like I couldn’t have made it more obvious that I was interested, but he didn’t come over to say anything.

When I was done with my work and getting ready to leave, I looked at him again, smiled, and said, “Bye.” He responded with a shy “bye,” and his face went a bit red again. He seemed like a very handsome, well-groomed, and masculine guy.

For context, I’m Spanish/Moroccan and have been living in Ireland for five years, but I still can’t quite figure out why Irish guys don’t approach women even when they seem interested. Maybe it’s cultural?

And yes, I know some people might ask why I didn’t approach him myself. Truthfully, I’m a bit old-fashioned and think it’s nice when guys take the lead. (Please don’t judge me for this—it’s just how I feel!)

In college I worked as a barista near a hospital and lots of the hospital staff were regular customers. After graduating med school, doctors would complete their residency program where they practice under the supervision of a more senior attending physician before being a full fledge doctor able to practice without supervision. Over the years, many residents finished their programs and moved elsewhere, never to be seen in the coffee shop again.This is important later. 

One of the regulars at the coffee shop was this gorgeous resident who was always friendly and kind. I was young, dumb and smitten which resulted in being nervous when he would show up. My barista friend group went out one night and this resident was at the same bar/restaurant with a group of other doctors in residency programs. We chatted for a minute and he shared that he had just finished the hospital rotation of his residency. I misinterpreted this to mean he finished his residency. Since he wouldn't be around anymore I apologized for being so awkward when he was at the coffee shop, explaining it was just because he was so attractive I would get nervous. He laughed and said not to worry about, then we went our separate ways for the rest of the night. 

I graduated college about a year later and got an office job in one of the hospital's clinics on the other side of town. My first day, the manager was walking me around and introducing me to all the staff...including the very same handsome resident! Turns out he was still in his residency program and had finished his inpatient rotation at the main hospital location. He was doing an outpatient rotation 3x a week at the clinic where I got hired. It was about a year later when he actually finished his residency and moved out of state. He never treated me differently or brought anything up, but I was mortified!!

TL;DR: Told a regular customer his attractiveness made me awkward because I thought I would never see him again. A year later, I got a job in a clinic and saw him 3x a week for about a year. ",0,1732648914.0,tifu,3,0.39,False
1h0k8zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/biathlon/comments/1h0k8zw/2425_biathlon_season_a_fourwoman_battle/,24/25 Biathlon Season: a Four-woman Battle?,"[https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/womens-2024-season-preview/daRi0yUR1dgDNtgV6hcwT](https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/womens-2024-season-preview/daRi0yUR1dgDNtgV6hcwT)

The second look into the 2024 Crystal Biathlon Ball revealed not just a single face as with the men; five women’s faces appeared simultaneously out of the fog, suggesting a four-way women’s battle for supremacy.

After the final competition last March, Lisa Vittozzi held the massive World Cup Total Score Crystal Globe, seizing the Yellow Bib 24 hours earlier from Ingrid Landmark Tandrevold. Almost written off after her career-low 31st in 2021/22, Vittozzi’s achievement was like a fairy tale. Yet, as the new season opens, four women: Lou Jeanmonnot, Tandrevold, Justine Braisaz-Bouchet, and Julia Simon are in a better position to take the title than Vittozzi who will miss Kontiolahti.

**Vittozzi’s Injury Changes her Season**

Defending Champion Vittozzi held the upper hand after her outstanding 2023/24 season, but that changed when an ailing back put her out of the first three individual competitions. With every competition counting towards the Total Score, Vittozzi’s chance of retaining is out the door. Her motto of “If you want something, you have to put in all you have to pursue your dreams,” will now be put to the ultimate test. Still, after a career-best 92% on the range, an IBU WCH title plus three additional medals, and six wins in the season, she could still be a player, but not for the top spot. The door to the big Crystal Globe is now open to her rivals.

**Watch Jeanmonnot**

Jeanmonnot’s steady ascent puts the 26-year-old among the top contenders, going from 2021/22 IBU Cup Total Score to 11th in her first full World Cup season, and second last year. The new French star grabbed twelve podiums including four wins. Her slight stumbles, 13th and 15th in Hochfilzen, were likely the difference makers at season’s end. Jeanmonnot matched Vittozzi’s 92% on the range, winning the Mass Start Score. It will be tough convincing Jeanmonnot she cannot win the Total Score in 2024/25.

**Tandrevold learned “from a painful experience”**

Tandrevold’s 2023/24 season was the best of her career. Although leading the Total Score race until mid-March, the Norwegian was up and down, especially in late season, but was pleased with her season, “…I had a lot of good races and progressed enormously.” On losing the Total Score title, “You learn more from a painful experience, like losing the Total Score in the last week of the season, than from a good experience.” Tandrevold obviously learned the lesson well, dominating the Sjusjoen Season Opener, with a Sprint/Mass Start double, shooting well both days. A furious last loop and photo-finish in the second competition assured Tandrevold, “I feel I am where I need to be physically.” After her fast start and renewed confidence, the always-looking-at-the bright-side Norwegian can now visualize herself with the Yellow Bib on the last day of the season.

**World Champion Justine Braisaz-Bouchet**

Braisaz-Bouchet returned from a maternity break with a vengeance, equaling Vittozzi’s six wins, shooting at a career high and matching her Olympic Mass Start Gold medal with the IBU World Championships title. Like Jeanmonnot and Tandrevold, a couple of early season competitions were the difference between first and fourth. In the recent French Selections, she finished 24 seconds behind Simon, but with three penalties to Simon’s one. Braisaz-Bouchet needs to jump from her 82% to 85% + shooting to win the Total Score.

**Simon’s Big Wins**

Simon’s 97-point deficit from Vittozzi, seems like a big gap, but just a blip here and there kept the IBU Sprint/Pursuit World Champion from her second Total Score title. Her two-point drop in shooting and sometimes slow cadence reemphasizes the small gap between her and the ultimate prize. The 28-year-old was on a hot streak all summer, taking titles at Blink, the Martin Fourcade Nordic Festival, and retaining her French Summer Pursuit title in mid-October. She recently won the mass start at the French Selections in Bessans over Jeanmonnot and Braisaz-Bouchet. Simon seems ready, admitting, “The preparation is long, and I am ready to put on a bib, even though I usually start the season slowly. I am glad we start with relays!” It would be no surprise to see Simon and Tandrevold duke it out for Yellow all season.

Beyond these five, are several contenders who have been near or battled for the Total Score title in recent seasons.

**Lena, Franzi and the Oebergs**

Lena Haecki-Gross, last year’s revelation, toiled for years with a single podium on her resume, the Swiss veteran broke through with two victories and three additional podiums. Her success was buoyed by accurate, fast shooting times. This and her track power built a winning formula, confirmed with two victories at the recent Swiss Selections competitions.

Franziska Preuss started last season with two early podiums, a career high on the range, and a cup of coffee in the Yellow Bib. She stopped her season after the IBU WCH to focus on health issues. A determined comeback culminated with a German Summer Champs short individual win. Preuss’ shooting and health will dictate her success.

The Oeberg sisters have both been tantalizingly close to the big Crystal Globe (Hanna 4th three times, Elvira 2nd in 2021/22). After two individual 2023 IBU WCH Gold medals, Hanna fell to a single podium last season. A team sprint race recently shows her readiness for a big season. Younger sister Elvira finished 7th in the 2023/24 Total Score, had a win, and three additional podiums, but dropped five points on the range. Elvira, one of the fastest women on skis, recently buried the sprint field at the Idre Season Opener; a return to the high 80s on the range is the key to her season.

Although the overall field is not as deep as the men, the Crystal Ball foresees an even more competitive season than last year. Stay tuned...",4,1732648905.0,biathlon,1,1.0,False
1h0k8wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0k8wo/my_wifes_butterfly_collection_helped_her_deal/,My wife's butterfly collection helped her deal with what we lost,"Sometimes we do things without really thinking them through, especially when we feel desperate. I think it's finally safe to share this story, everyone else who knew about it is either dead or senile. I'm so old at this point that it doesn't really matter if anyone comes after me, anyway.

My wife, Anna-Karin, and I both worked as research assistants at a remote military installation in Sweden. This was in the mid 1960s, DNA had more or less just been discovered, and even though we couldn't work with it directly at the time, the race was on to unlock the secrets of engineering life. Still, our lab was at least a decade ahead of main stream medicine. We were trying anything we could to see what it would do. Our research group was small, but our lab spaces were situated within a large and active compound, with several buildings. Our group was assigned a building with several small rooms dedicated to different parts of the work, and offices for the seniors. The compound also included housing for the researchers, even though ours was quite modest in comparison to the higher ups, as well as a military hospital. Our latest line of research involved taking mitochondria from one species and inserting them into the cells of others, and to monitor the results. Anna-Karin was a hobbyist Lepidopterist and she was often tasked with gathering donor materials, so most of our experiments involved using mitochondria from butterflies and moths for experiments with rats.

Our results were quite something. The rats would develop normally, but the pups showed increased vigour and lower infant mortality than regular rats. Furthermore, they developed faster, which we attributed to a higher metabolic rate in the insects. We would harvest fertile eggs from donor females and replace the mitochondria under a microscope, they were then placed in the Fallopian tubes of sterilised females using a catheter guided by ultrasound. The egg would be fertilised naturally by males that shared the same enclosure. Our project leader, Dr. Marklund, a distinguished upper middle age man with coffee breath so intense it would make a dog turn its nose, would later join a research team in England that pioneered a similar procedure in humans known as gamete intrafallopian transfer (using unmodified eggs of course). However, it took them over 20 more years before it became a viable fertility treatment, and it never saw much use as in-vitro fertilisation was made available even before then.

Anna-Karin and I were both 24 years old at the time, we'd met at university where we studied biomedicine. She was brilliant, and could easily have been the project lead if she had been born with a Y-chromosome, but during this period the intelligence of women was rarely appreciated to the same extent as it is today. I fell for her instantly, her radiant smile and intoxicating laugh was nearly enough for me to get down on one knee right then and there. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with breast cancer at 71 years old, and passed away from complications of the treatment shortly after her 72nd birthday. We were happily married for the better part of 51 years. However, at the time of our stint at the research lab in question, we had actively been trying to conceive a child for three years, and after ten miscarriages Anna-Karin was falling into a deep depression. Her work and butterfly collecting was a good escape though, and for her 24th birthday I had managed to acquire a live chrysalis of a beautiful North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), which she cherished dearly.

Our research was progressing rapidly. Not only was the vitality of the modified rats exceptional, their cells also showed increased resistance to several known strains of anthrax, and botulinum toxin. The goal of our research was of course to facilitate military applications during the height of the cold war, so this was extremely thrilling to everyone involved. At this point, we didn't let any of the test subjects reach maturity, they were all euthanized before week three and subsequently dissected to facilitate study of their physiology and biochemistry. I would perform the dissections and Anna-Karin would handle modification and implantation of the eggs. We were often left alone in the lab as Dr Marklund was busy analysing the collected data and courting the military leadership for additional funding.

Anna-Karins mood improved. Steadily, she overcame her depression and gained a new lease on life. One fateful day in December of 1965, she came to me and told me her period was three weeks late. This wasn't the first time, but she seemed so full of confidence that I was swept along in her elation. A month passed, then two. This time it really seemed as though the baby was healthy. I was overjoyed! Not only did I have my wife back, we were also finally going to be parents.

As the due date approached, Anna-Karin left on maternity leave two weeks early to prepare. Policies on parental leave were not quite as progressive during these days, and I was expected to keep working as before. Anyway, with her gone from the lab, all of the day to day work was offloaded on me. These weeks were stressful. Additionally, the military leadership was overjoyed with our results and wanted us to begin testing with higher mammals as soon as possible! I managed to convince them to postpone those plans until we were fully staffed again.

On Friday afternoon, the 16th of September 1966, our son was born. A nurse at the hospital within the compound called the lab to let me know Anna-Karin had been admitted and was already significantly dilated. I was not allowed to leave my post in the lab, but I made certain I wouldn't have to stay a second longer than necessary. When I finally got there, he had already made his appearance, 4132 grams, above average but healthy, and happily sleeping in his mothers arms. The birth had been painless (figuratively speaking), and Anna-Karin had been a champ throughout the entire ordeal! We had already decided on a name: Magnus.

The following week, I had to return to work as usual. I needed to clear out old samples from the refrigerator to make room, we couldn't keep them frozen since that would damage the mitochondria. One of the old vials tucked into the back of one of the shelves caught my eye, the label read: #422: \*D. plexippus\*, which is not a native species. In fact, its the North American monarch butterfly. As far as I knew, we hadn't experimented with anything but local material so far. I inquired to Dr. Marklund about it, but he told me that there had been no specific requests for new species, and that he trusted in Anna-Karins judgement in collecting suitable material. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, there really was only one way she could have gotten her hands on this sample, but why would she have brought it here?

Back home, I found Anna-Karin and Magnus both sleeping in bed. I decided to use the opportunity to confirm what I already suspected. After going through all of her display cases I was certain, the monarch butterfly I had gifted her was not in the collection. She would definitely have preserved it. As I turned around to leave, Anna-Karin was standing in the doorway, guilt and fear written all over her face. ""I'd hoped you'd never find out"" she told me, in a low voice. Her eyes could barely meet my gaze. I suspect you'll find it hard to believe, but it truly wasn't before then that I put all the pieces together. ""Is Magnus..."" I got out before Anna-Karin nodded and gave me confirmation. I had to sit down, I couldn't believe this was happening. ""He's our perfect little boy"" she told me, ""Our research has shown nothing but upsides and..."", ""No!"" I interrupted, ""don't you realise what you've done? If Dr. Marklund or anyone in the military finds out, he'll become a lab rat! Besides, we still don't know the long term implications..."", ""They wont find out, how would they?"" she retorted. I stayed in my chair, as a silence fell between us. Magnus broke our trance when he started crying. We made our way over to the bedroom, and I gestured to Anna-Karin that I wanted to comfort him. Holding him in my arms and looking into his eyes, he quickly calmed down. My worries melted away. ""You're probably right, as long as we keep this between us, he'll be safe,"" I told Anna-Karin with a smile, as she came in to hug us both.

Still, I couldn't help but worry. What little sleep I managed to get that week was plagued by nightmares. In an effort to stifle my anxiety, I approached Dr Marklund and suggested that we should allow the latest cohort of rats to reach maturity, in order to observe the long term effects of the treatment. I motivated this request by saying that this would be a logical precursor to more intensive studies with higher mammals, as had been requested by the military. It would also reduce my workload in Anna-Karins absence, since it would remove the need for dissections for a time. He agreed, and it was decided that we would move all pups to a separate enclosure as soon as they stopped nursing and allow them to develop freely. For the moment, my worry abated.

Weeks passed, and life was beginning to return to normal. Magnus was the happiest baby either of us had ever met, almost always smiling and beginning to laugh at the silly faces we made at him. The only thing that brought a frown to his face was hunger, and his appetite was exceptional. Magnus was quite a pudgy baby, at 8 kilograms by week 3. Anna-Karin was having trouble keeping up, since his hunger seemed impossible to satiate, so we supplemented his diet with baby formula.

The rats in the lab were healthy as well, though their growth was beginning to mirror Magnus' in ways that were becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. They required several feedings per day and would get quite vocal in their complaints if I took too long to deliver. Foods high in sugar, like dried fruit, was especially popular and some of the rats were getting fat enough that their legs barely seemed to hold them, their bellies dragging along the floor. I had to move them to a larger enclosure.

Gradually, Magnus' appetite faded. Over only a few days, he went from overeating to barely eating at all. He started running a fever and was coughing up thick, stringy mucous. We were reluctant to bring him to the hospital, fearful that his true nature would be revealed, but when Anna-Karin woke me in the middle of the night, frantic, the reality of the situation hit us like a ton of bricks. Magnus was unresponsive and barely breathing, his skin was clammy, scaly and darker than usual, his belly was rock solid. He felt stiff all over, no sign of that chubby flimsy physique we were familiar with.

We rushed to the hospital. When we arrived, only a nurse and a single on-call doctor was present. The nurse rushed to get a hold of the only doctor on the base with any paediatric experience, as the doctor made an initial examination. He reassured us that Magnus' heart was still beating. The paediatrician stared in disbelief, he had never seen anything like it, and Magnus was placed under observation. We saw no improvement for several days, in fact, his skin steadily grew harder and darker. It became obvious to Anna-Karin and I that perhaps our experiments had come with some unforeseen side effects.

I had to keep working in the lab while Anna-Karin stayed at the hospital with Magnus. The rats had begun showing similar symptoms, the frantic squeaking for food was gone, instead they were moving around restlessly. One morning, I found one of the rats in a corner of the enclosure, it had shed most of its fur and the skin was as hard as rock. Instead of informing Dr Marklund, I picked it up, and with a lump in my throat began dissecting it. Puncturing the skin was difficult. Inside I found no bone and no intestines, only a few organs remained, suspended in a viscous, semi-transparent fluid. This was probably exactly the same thing Magnus was going through. I euthanized the remaining rats, disposed of their remains, and informed Dr Marklund that the rats had died, apparently due to heart failure and probably as a result of their obesity.

We spent every night at the hospital for a week. I'd told Anna-Karin about the state of the rat in the lab, and we were both fully aware of the implications. Something would emerge from Magnus' chrysalis, neither of us wanted to imagine what, and there was nothing we could do but wait.

At some point, we must have both fallen asleep on the bed next to Magnus', exhaustion from never ending worry taking its toll, because we were both wrenched back to the waking world by a bone-chilling scream. The only nurse on duty was standing in the doorway, a dark lanky figure looming over her. Looking over at Magnus' bed, only a husk remained, he had emerged! Anna-Karin and I shouted ""wait!"" in unison, and Magnus turned toward us. Dark, spherical, unreadable eyes looked us over, and his face briefly signalled hesitation, perhaps some flicker of recognition, before he turned back toward the door and forced his way past the nurse. We leapt out of bed and rushed after him, but he was fast and the building was small. Through the glass doors, we could see him unfurl enormous wings in the lamp light, then he was gone.

Of course, the nurses story and the remains of Magnus' chrysalis in the hospital left no room for excuses. The military leadership and Dr. Marklund knew right away what game we had been playing for the past several months. Nevertheless, we were questioned, and eventually faced termination (of employment). No criminal charges were raised, probably mostly because the subject of the incident was too sensitive to bring to court.

We were both devastated, of course. Anna-Karin fell back into depression, and I wasn't sure what to do for her other than to offer support. Eventually, I managed to find a job teaching biology at a gymnasium (that's the term for upper secondary schools in many parts of Europe, roughly equivalent to high school). Times were tough, but we scraped by. Anna-Karin devoted most of her time to her butterfly collection, which grew to become quite impressive in the end. On Saturday, the 17th of July 1971, our little miracle, Ingrid, was born. Things became brighter again and instead of just living day by day, we managed to look toward the future. We kept pictures of Magnus up, but never told Ingrid the truth. As far as she knows, he died suddenly in his cot.

Lepidoptera can migrate long distances. We never expected to see Magnus again. Around the new year, the same year that he made his escape, a small notice in the local newspaper caught our attention: ""Mothman spotted in West Virginia."" It seems Magnus' instincts brought him back to his natural habitat. Ultimately we fear he did end up as a specimen to be studied in a lab, just on the other side of the ocean. Magnus, if through some miracle you're reading this, know that your mother and I never stopped thinking about you, and I hope that you are safe.",2,1732648898.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

My partner also cleaned out the farmer's handspun stash for a future blanket scarf to weave. There was some washed fleeces I wish I could've walked away with, but I lack the experience and the time for now. The farmer let us see some of the llamas and they looked so charming with their bottom teeth and long eyelashes 🥹🥹🥹 They also work as therapy llamas and the farmer was super informative about llama behaviour and care.

Second stop was **Northwest Yarns and Mercantile**! This was actually not on my list and we only got the recommendation that day, BUT WOW, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. The space is huge!!! And there's something for every fibre artist here, which blew my mind. Lots of stuff for sewists, weavers, spinners, and knitting/crocheting people. There's an pleasant space to hold knitting circles, and there are stacks and shelves and piles of yarn! Lots of local and commercial stuff. Dozens and dozens of spinning wheels and hand spindles. Looms and accessories. Local hand-dyed combed braids and commercial bumps, as well as my first in-person experience with Indian cashmere. There were also bolts of fabric for sewists, but I was on a time crunch and I couldn't inspect much of it. I cannot believe I did not walk away with something from there, but I will make the trip to do a combo-visit to this store and Spincycle Yarns. The owner was so nice and showed me her EEW! **Also!** They have cute axolotls called Warp and Weft, if you are absolutely not interested in anything else. I'm trying to keep this short and somewhat coherent, but I cannot emphasize enough how excited this store makes me feel!

Made it to Portland and went visited a bunch of vintage stores and coffee shops on a rainy day. We also stumbled into **Backstory Books and Yarn**. If you're a fan of getting lost in the stacks and looking through random book piles, this is your place - especially if you did not vibe with Powell's books and the corporate vibe that place gives off. The owner is also a fiber savant and stashes yarn in the fiber/knitting/crafting shelves (: There were some orphaned skeins and sock blanks, some yarns from Three Fates and Green Mountain Spinnery (a worker's co-op!), but most endearingly, there are some handspuns in the stacks! If you're a fan of grabbing souvenir handspuns, these are charming and super reasonably priced. There are also some small print and niche books on spinning here too (like a dog hair spinning book I didn't grab). This was my personal fave, but be warned, there is no fibre to be found here.

I also visited **Fiber Rhythm Craft and Design**! A huge space, but had less local stuff (so less of a draw to me personally). They had a lot of Ashford wheels, spindles, and roving, as well as a bunch of looms. Lots of Malabrigo at this store, I noticed. They had one or two local yarns and rovings. I would say a big draw of this place is that it has some weaver representation and cones of yarn that my partner appreciated! He's really into linen and I'm definitely on the search for local wool, so this store did not have what we were looking for, unfortunately.

Lastly, I visited **Northwest Wools**. I was a little nervous entering the store, since I have read some pretty bad anecdotes on this sub-reddit (especially as a bit of a neurodivergent goth), but I had a really lovely experience! Lots of Madeline Tosh, Three Fates, Noro, and other popular yarns. Their roving is also so so so cool. A wall dedicated to Dicentra Designs, a shelf for Tumalo Fiber, some Malabrigo Nube and what I can only assume is Ashford roving in the back of the store. There was also some fiber bags (around 3-4oz each) from Shaggy Bear Farms, which apparently is a sheep and animal rescue and some of the fiber is from rehabilitated sheep! I walked away from some black Navajo Churro and the white Colombian Rambouillet (which was super reasonably priced at $3USD for 1oz/\~30g). I asked the clerk for their opinions on fiber and they were super helpful and even recommended a cool fiber field book (that I didn't end up getting due to my budget). That clerk in particular also had some hand-dyed stuff for sale in the store too and they braided my fiber really nicely. Overall, I think you'll get the best selection of stuff from this store if you could only visit one store in Portland and I had a nice experience.

This is definitely not my last trip between Bellingham and Portland, and I wish Seattle traffic was better so I could've had more time to explore there before going back to the border. Super bummed, because I definitely wanted to check out Quintessential Knits, but had to choose between that or my now-favourite $1 taco place. If anyone has any other stores or farms they recommend, I would love to hear about them so I can make my own road-trip map for the next time (:",6,1732648856.0,Handspinning,8,1.0,False

I know a couple people here but there aren't a lot of student associations for internationals from what I could find online, so I'm looking for people who are down to hang out together. 

A little bit about myself, I'm 22M and used to live in the Hague for school before I moved out for university. I really enjoy going for a drink or going to festivals, but I also am down for more chill activities like grabbing a coffee or hitting up the library. I've also done bouldering a couple of times which was pretty fun. I'm pretty open minded so if there's a suggestion I'm usually down to try it. I was really into the techno scene at my old city, and it would also be fun to maybe go to pip with a group of people. 

If this sounds like your vibe then send me a DM or write a comment on the post and let's arrange something 😀. Also if a lot of people reply I can also make a groupchat on WhatsApp. ",4,1732648820.0,TheHague,3,1.0,False

I finally got a “bite” after I walked into a location and spoke with someone from HR. They were kind enough  to talk to me. 

They pointed me toward a position they’d just posted that day, and advised me to apply online. 

(Side note: To any Boomers, this is 1000% poof that you can’t walk into a place, give a firm handshake, and not leave without a job. 

It hasn’t worked that way in at least 2 decades. Everything has been online since employers realized they could take the “face” out of their candidates. It separates them from the human and makes denying them easier if they don’t have to talk to them in person.)

Well, the in person chat went very well. They seemed to like me. He said to give them a week for the post to gain traction, then they would contact me. 

I really wanted this job, so I spent 2 hours that night perfecting my resume and cover letter. 

5 anxiety filled days later…

I got an email saying they would call me for a phone interview at the times I’d provided. I thought it would be that day. 

1 anxiety filled day later…

I was at a coffee shop listing my things for sale (like, I seriously need this job. I’m down to selling my nice stuff) when they called. 

The phone interview went great. 
I was friendly, and answered all of their questions. I got a few chuckles out of them at a joke or two. The interview lasted 15 minutes. 

They now that I’ve been going the extra mile on my own for months to study that field, and actively participate in it to learn, which means they know I show a tangible interest in making my career in that field. 

They really seemed to like me, and said they would contact me either the next day (Friday), or the following Monday (two days ago) if they wanted to move forward with me. 

I sent them a brief, professional yet friendly follow up email on Saturday thanking them for their consideration, that I’m excited to hear from them, and that I appreciate them. 

It’s Tuesday. 

I haven’t heard anything. 

I’m sure I did everything right. 

I spoke to them in person first - showing my willingness to come to them. 

I applied with the perfect resume and cover letter highlighting my qualifications and why I’d be a perfect fit. 

I had a lengthy interview wherein I was personable and did my best to make them feel comfortable talking to me even though I was nervous as hell (nerves may have added to chattiness at times. They never cut me off.)  My years of customer service has let me perfect that trait. I was very transparent about who I am, my goals, and that they would get 110% of my abilities. I displayed an eagerness to learn and join the team. I’m getting started in this field. 

(You HAVE to start somewhere. Experience doesn’t poof into existence no matter how much employers expect it to.)

I sent a follow up thank you email that I knew they would see on Monday to show my gratitude, that I’m still interested, that I’ll take extra steps, and to keep myself in their minds. 

And yet, nothing. 

I know it’s the day after they said they would contact me, so should I give them more time? How long is “reasonable” to wait before sending a follow up inquiry email to show I’m still interested? 

(My current job has cut hours for everyone so much that I can’t afford to stay in my place, let alone pay bills anymore. I’m behind with creditors calling me, I owe back loans, and my car decides this month is a great time to explode with problems. Not to mention my grandma died, and I need to travel home this week for her funeral, but can’t until I get the car fixed. I have NO money. That’s why I’m selling my stuff, but no one is buying it. I don’t have junk. I’m in this situation due to forces outside my control. I’m trying to get help, and I’m trying to get work elsewhere. I’m not just sitting on my ass. I’m mentally exhausted from all this and more, and I’m almost out of time - not just to make my grandma’s funeral (my last grandparent), but to avoid eviction. 

I really REALLY need this job. I made sure not to sound desperate during the interview, though.

My (32M) bf (now ex) & I (26F) were together for 4ish years. 8 months ago we decided to move in together. It was amazing until it wasn't. He's always been emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive, and I lost myself in the relationship. He was also a cheater, and I too him back each time. That’s how I knew I lost myself. 
Holding onto the good, and never that bad. Holding on to the potential, hoping he would change, yadda, vadda, yadda.... 2 months ago, we get into a fight over something small, and then he breaks up with me, and he's an absolute asshole about it. Shitting on me, saying incredibly hurtful things, and just overall awful. I'm shocked, & heartbroken, but only until I move out, a week later. Once l'm out, l immediately have clarity, I'm lighter, happier, feeling like myself again. And I'm like okay, thank god that happened, sucks that it was traumatic, but thank god I'm out. I unfortunately didn't have the courage to end it, but I'm just happy it's over.
I get my own place, living alone for the first time and I'm LOVING IT. I'm starting this new self journey, and I'm excited to do so.
So about 2 weeks ago, I decided to get on dating apps.
I'm feeling good about myself, my confidence is back and I'm like okay let's go on casual dates, emphasis on casual.
I'm notttt looking for a relationship, but I am looking to have fun and connect and just enjoy my time with people.

2 years ago, my MacBook went kaput, and he insisted that I just have his old one, I was hesitant to take it, but he convinced me to take it, he had no use for it anymore and I might as well. It was a really sweet gesture at the time.
So fast forward to a few days ago, I get a text from my ex and he's asking for the laptop back. I'm like, something
must've happened, he doesn't actually want this back, he's just being petty about something. Somethinggg pissed him off...
So initially I'm like sure thing, l'll leave it with the leasing office and you can pick it up there (because I do NOT want to see him). He calls me childish and stupid and is like ""why would you get them involved, you're immature"" essentially. THEN he goes ""you should put your immaturity level in the headlines of you BUMBLE BIO"". There it isss, I KNEW he was pissed about something. He's mad because he found out I'm on the apps. Mind you, he viciously broke up with ME?
So I'm like lol okay I'll put it in a box and drop it off on the doorstep. He's like cool, thanks. Conversation is over.

TWENTY MINUTES LATER, he sends me a graphic video that he took of us a year ago. He had my consent to record this video at the time. It was an intimate video & that is all!!! I will say about it. So he sends it, and he goes
""Never forget✨ "" mind you, l'm in the middle of a coffee shop, broad daylight, and completely appalled at this graphic ass video on my phone. I'm pissedddd.
So I reply and I basically say, ""this was a really fucking weird thing to send man”
Then he goes off on me, the way he would always do.
Telling me he doesn't like that l'm acting as if I broke up with him, l'm a shit person, I'm never gonna make love like that again, I'm a fucking problem, I'm just like my parents, blah blah blah.
If it weren't for the beautiful headspace I am in, that text would've sent me spiraling. But since I am in such a great headspace, I replied to his belittling message and said
""I'm not your problem anymore dude, get ahold of yourself""
And then I blocked his number.

And NOW.... I don't wanna give the laptop back? I've ALWAYS been the bigger person with him, and after sending me that video, and then trying to belittle me and make me feel hurt? Why on earth would I give this laptop back? I know he doesn't actually need it, or else he would've asked for it back the day I moved out of the apartment 2 months ago?

1h0k0x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h0k0x6/something_happened_to_my_girlfriend/,Something happened to my girlfriend,"A little over a few months ago I noticed a change in my girlfriend, Charlotte. To go back before that, we met a few years ago when we were both working at the same crappy part time job. This is important, because long before we started dating I knew this was a woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with 

I promise I wasn't some creepy stalker about it, I was perfectly happy being friends with her. At first we only saw each other at work, a crappy pizza joint that only the worst people in the city seemed to visit. But every day when I got to work she was there with a smile and a joke, sometimes a snack to share. The more time I spent with her, the more I wanted to become someone she could be proud of. 

At first we really only saw each other at work. Then I started picking her up to go to the mall together, we would get coffee or dinner once a week, then before long we were dating. 

I worked hard at that job, and I've worked hard at every job I've had since I met her. She really makes me a better person and that's not just a tangent about how much I love her, she's such a wonderful person that everyone around her just kind of improves by default. 

I say that because … I need you to know it for what I'm about to tell you next. 

A while back my girlfriend (of two years at that point, I've known her for four and a half now) came home from a camping trip and started acting differently. At first it was little stuff, she totally lost her appetite for a while and didn't seem to want to eat anything. We assumed it was a stomach bug, or stress from work, and she tried to dial it back to get more rest. At first that seemed to be what she needed, her appetite came back for a while and she even seemed better than before.

Then she couldn't sleep at night. It started slowly, with her staying up on her phone for a few minutes longer than usual, then an hour, then I was waking up at 4 in the morning to find her pacing back and forth in the hallway of our apartment. 

While that was going on (remember all of this developed over the last 6 months or so) she seemed to get more spaced out and day dreamy a lot. I would come home and find her starting out the window. When I would ask what she was looking at she would just smile and point at something I couldn't seem to see. Other times I would wake up in the middle of the night to find her staring at a wall, or just standing in a doorway not doing anything. Every time I talked to her about it she promised me it was nothing, or that she would go see her doctor if it went on. I wanted to believe her as much as I wanted it to be nothing.

After that she started going out into the woods alone at night. It's not a big forest, maybe a quarter acre or so, and spread out across a few people's backyards. At first I didn't really think much of it. Like everything else it started small and escalated. She would go out for a quick twenty minute walk right at sunset, then it was thirty minutes, then forty-five, then an hour. Before very long I would be long asleep before I felt her creeping into bed next to me. 

Other than that, her behavior didn't change. Despite hardly eating or sleeping she was still her kind and sweet self during the day. She was loving, thoughtful, and just as intelligent as ever. She also didn’t seem to be going through a lot of physical changes. A little weight loss which worried me, but she swore she felt okay.

That's really why I didn't think about it too much. She wasn't acting too different from her usual self during the day, and if all she was battling was insomnia and nausea, then she could cope how she needed to. I think a part of me was worried about stressing her out even more by bothering her about all of it too much, so I sat by and waited.

That was foolish of me, in hindsight. But then again, we always tried to assume the best about each other. 

Then it got a lot harder to ignore. When I would kiss her in the morning I could taste iron. Not overwhelmingly, but as if she'd had blood in her mouth a few hours before and rinsed her mouth out. And I don’t mean blood from flossing, I mean I could taste it in her mouth as if her mouth had been full of blood just a few hours prior. I started finding packages in the trash for raw steak. Sure she could've been cooking them without me knowing somehow, but there were so many of them. I couldn't understand how she was eating that much steak in a week, especially after her problems with nausea. 

That was when I finally started asking questions, but I was too afraid to press very hard. Instead I kept pretending everything was normal. We kept going about our new routine, pretending nothing was wrong, until the neighborhood pets started going missing. 

I couldn't take it anymore, I didn't care if she spent another mortgage on steak or even hunted down squirrels and whatnot as long as that was making her happy, but she couldn't hurt people's precious pets. That wasn’t like her, and it wasn’t something I could let my girlfriend get away with either.

I basically had no evidence it was her, except the shift in her behavior at night (and the occasional episode of spacing out). But something deep inside me knew.

I waited up for her a few nights ago when she went on one of her nighttime strolls. When she got back, around four in the morning, she had blood around her mouth. 

The strangest part though was that she looked different: her eyes were wider, more oval shaped than they're supposed to be, her pupils were almost gray instead of black. 

I sat her down on the couch and asked what was going on. Slowly her features seemed to shift back to normal, and as they did her eyes welled up with tears. I pulled her into my arms and she cried while she told me what had been happening. 

She told me something happened after the camping trip, at least to the best of her knowledge that's when the change occurred. 

She said it started pretty much the way I saw it for her too. She couldn't sleep, started eating a lot less, then the cravings started. All she wanted was steak, and at first she was cooking it. Then she realized she wanted to eat it raw, and started doing that. Then one night on her walks she saw a wounded rabbit, it seemed like somebody's dog or cat had bit it and done fatal damage, but not been able to eat it. 

She ate the rabbit, and she said it was the most exhilarating, perfect experience she'd ever had. She found that she wasn't tired during the day either when she ate the little animals in the forest. She could go a whole day without needing to eat as much, just snacks here and there, as long as she was eating the occasional small animal from her nightly walks.

But then she found that she needed more and more animals to feel okay. If she couldn't hunt enough rabbits or squirrels in a night, she felt sick and sluggish all day. She told me it didn’t even feel like a conscious thought for her. In the same way that I would walk to the fridge when I’m hungry, she would head out into the woods each night. All she knew was that there was something that could make her feel better, amidst all these weird changes she was going through.

So she kept hunting, trying not to overdo it, she would only kill and eat exactly as much as she needed. That was where the steak came in, it was the only thing other than raw living animals that she could eat and get any sense of fullness from. But eventually,  the steak stopped doing it for her, and she was worried about over-hunting the woods behind our house. She stopped hunting for almost a week, she said she was trying to let the local wildlife recover, but she was starving. One night, during her fasting period, she got desperate and ate the dog that had attacked a two year old the year before (see, she's always trying to do the right thing even in a moral grey area). 

But that also became too little food very quickly. She needed more food, larger prey so to speak. Again, it wasn’t that she wanted to, the survival instinct seemed to kick in and take over. 

She read an article about a man who attacked a child and was let out of prison He only lived a few miles from us, he was on the registry now so his address was public information. She said it wasn't hard to find him. She said he made the perfect meal. 

According to her humans are perfect because she doesn't need to eat as often. She said most nights she can walk through the woods, eating only the occasional small animal. 

Then on nights when she’s extra hungry and she's had the opportunity to prepare in advance, she looks for what she considers to be a deserving victim, and she goes after them. Dinner and community service all at the same time (that’s my joke, not hers).

She sobbed as she told me all of this, said she hated herself for it but she couldn't help it. She doesn’t want to be like this anymore. She wants nothing more than to live normally, go back to the way things were before whatever it was that changed her.

She was telling the truth. Say what you want, but I know this woman and I know when she's lying. She was being honest with me, and it shattered my heart to see her so sad. 

I told her I would help her look for a solution, some kind of cure for whatever was wrong, and that's what I've been doing. I’ve discovered the more she hunts and kills at night, the more she transforms at night. I don’t know if it’s a direct result of the hunting, killing, and eating, or if it’s just that the changes are occurring over  time, but I plan on figuring it out.

She always looks like her usual sweet self when we wake up in the morning, but now by the time I go to sleep her skin has turned grey, her eyes are huge and dark, and her fingers are long and grey. She's starting to grow claws too, and now I can only imagine what the next stage in her transformation will be. 

I've been looking online for someone who can help. Obviously it's hard to find someone who can deal with a problem like this. Someone online suggested I find a shaman so that's what I'm going to do. I've been looking at various people’s websites all morning, trying to find one that doesn’t seem like a total scam. I found a few in and around my city (try googling “shaman’s near me” you’ll be surprised by how many results you get) and now I just need to find one we can trust.



It’s been a few days and we met with the Shaman I found. I actually met with all five of them on my own first, and found the one I trusted the most, then I took Charlotte to meet with them together.

The Shaman, a much older woman named Millie, sat with us for a long time, asking questions about everything that had been going on and for how long. We met in her home, a cute little multi story townhouse in the city that was full of all sorts of fascinating things.

The mantle, in the room the three of us sat in, was quite literally overflowing with picture frames. Something told me the best gift you could possibly give Millie was a picture frame, and maybe a gift card to a store that sells picture frames. There were old black and white photos of her when she was young and gorgeous with a whole host of people. Some of the people appeared in the photos a lot, some of them only once or twice, but it was clear that everyone on the mantle was very near and dear to Millie’s heart.

The sitting room was also packed with various pieces of furniture that seemed linked to each other only by the fond memories they must have held for Millie, as every piece of furniture in that room was completely unique. There was a French style fainting couch at the edge of the room, a large plush leather couch, a rocking chair that looked as if it may have been hand carved, and a delicate pink loveseat that Millie sat on. Charlotte and I took the large brown leather couch, and I let my eyes wander around the room as Millie and Charlotte talked.

Charlotte recounted the story about her camping trip as Millie listened intently. Millie seemed to catch something we didn’t as I still have no idea how the camping trip could have started all this. Charlotte they were hiking through Appalachia, and camped one night on the outskirts of an old cemetery.

Millie found that particularly interesting and asked, “Did you do anything y’all shouldn’t have when you passed by the burial grounds? Said something rude about one of the deceased, walked on hallowed ground without paying respects, even spitting on a gravestone could do it.”

Charlotte looked horrified, “No, we would never. Everyone in the group is a history buff, we just wanted to see the old cemetery. My friend Megan wanted to research some of the names after to see if we could learn anything about them. Then we camped about a mile from there and went on our way.”

Millie nodded, her weathered face looking tense, “I’m not trying to accuse you of anything sweetheart. Sometimes evil spirits get invited in by mistake, sometimes they try to take over when they see someone they think is weak enough. But I’m just not sure that yours fits either of those options.”

I grabbed Charlotte’s hand and leaned forward, “So what does that mean, and what do we do? Can we get rid of it? Charlotte didn’t do anything wrong, she would never hurt someone on purpose. And she’s still working really hard not to hurt anyone.”

We had told Millie about the animals, the dog, but I had asked Charlotte not to talk about the people. I know she’s only doing what she has to, she knows that too, but a stranger might not understand. Even so, I think Millie knew we were holding back information.

Millie eyed me carefully before saying, “It seems to me that a spirit has latched on to her. It can’t fully take control because she won’t let it act out the worst of its desires, if she’s been able to stay contained to mostly small animals, and she’s being careful not to be too greedy, the spirit won’t be able to take over. But if she lets the spirit do whatever it wants… then you have a problem, dear.”

I did my best to keep my face a mask of calm as I asked, “What if she did hurt a person? Would it be too late?”

Millie pursed her lips, “It’s only too late once she no longer wants the spirit to leave. As long as Charlotte keeps fighting you have a chance to help her, but when she gives up it’s all over.”

Charlotte squeezed my hand as she said, “I still want it to leave. I’m willing to do what it takes to get rid of it.”

Millie smiled, “You’re good people, both of you. I trust you’ll do the right thing.” She turned to look at me directly, “I’ll tell you what you have to do, but young man it’s your responsibility to be there for her through what comes next. You both have to be strong. You’ll have to starve the spirit.”

I glanced over at Charlotte nervously. She looked as brave as ever, and I tried to find the same bravery inside of myself, but I was terrified. What if getting rid of this spirit killed Charlotte?

Charlotte wasn’t even looking at me, she fixed a resolute gaze on Millie, “Tell me how.”

Millie explained that it was really quite simple, all we would have to do is not let Charlotte hunt until it starved the spirit out. She could still eat people food, although Millie said the only thing she’s allowed to eat raw is fruits and vegetables, meat has to be cooked. She said Charlotte will probably go through periods of being really hungry and able to eat just fine, then there will be periods where she won’t eat at all unless we allow her to hunt. Those are the moments where I have to be most cautious, Millie said I’ll experience as much temptation as Charlotte does when I have to watch her suffer.

Every day that goes by gets harder than the last. At first I thought I could handle it, Charlotte has always been a tough girl, but watching her go through this has been a nightmare. I’ve been cooking dinner for the two of us every night, everything is fully cooked, and I’ve been trying to make sure she’s eating as many nutrient dense foods as possible too. I know she’s not eating as much as she should be, but every night when we sit down to dinner she gives me this big trembling smile, and I can tell she’s eating as much as she can.

I wake up every morning to see her looking tired and drawn. She tries to stay inside at night so she can avoid temptation, which means now I wake up most nights to a creature that bears a vague resemblance to my girlfriend, pacing at the foot of our bed. When my alarm goes off around six, I wake up again to see her pale, almost haggard face smiling next to me.

I don’t know how she does it. Despite everything she’s going through she’s still so happy and sweet. She sits next to me while I make dinner, chatting and reminding me how grateful she is for everything I’m doing for her. I keep reminding her it’s for us, she’s my future so of course I’m going to take care of her.

Lately she’s been asking me to stay awake at night, just for a few hours, because the cravings have been so strong. I called Millie again and asked her if this is normal, and she said it takes a long time to dislodge an evil spirit like this. 

She also reassured me that it’s very clear that Charlotte isn’t allowing the spirit to take over, which gives her a much better chance of being able to get rid of it. I don’t know how much longer I can watch her suffer like this though. She seems to be growing weaker everyday, and I’m afraid she’ll die before the evil spirit leaves.



Charlotte is sick. Really sick. She’s been tossing and turning in bed with a fever for the last few days, I’m worried this is going to kill her. 

I’m going out tonight to find her something to eat. I’ll make sure it’s someone deserving. But I can’t risk losing the love of my life, I would rather see everyone else fall at her hands than watch her die like this. She doesn’t deserve that, and I don’t think I do either.

OK I work at Starbucks. The vast majority of our customers aren't very discerning. It's glorified fast food. We have a goal of 45s drive through time during peak business. It gets insane at the bar with mobile orders and everything all at once.  
Sometimes I'll make a little mistake on bar and not even realize it. The drink *never* gets sent back. I follow routines and recipes. I try my best. But hey, sometimes you make a mistake and it's not your cafe, it's Starbucks. Noones going to tell their friends that their cinnamon dolce oatmilk latte, cold foam instead of whip cream, doesn't have cinnamon dolce dust on top and therefore this coffee shop should be avoided.  
Anyways, the drive through. Some people manning the window--I get along with them, I don't think they are overly pedantic--worry a but too much, and if I tell them, ""Hey I poured this energy refresher in a trenta cup instead of a venti."" They say that will mess with the proportuons of the drink (its a canned energy drink, wirh tea added). I say, ""I added extra ice and put the same amount of passion tea on top. Just hand it to then."" We're all slammed, I have like 5 order stickers on my arm, I'm just letting them know because, yeah, if you work there, you're going to notice the cup size is different and think maybe I made the wrong drink... the drink gets sent back.  
I've had this happen once or twice, where like, we run out of sprinkles and if I tell the drive through, we just ran out of sprinkles, but there's a line around the building, just mark out sprinkles and let anyone else who orders know. Drink gets sent back.  
Hey this usually gets a nitro lid but they don't want cold foam, see if the flat lid is fine. Drink sent back, they want nitro lid.  
If the same thing happens as a genuine mistake and I don't say anything, the drink is never sent back. We never receive any complaint.  
When I'm on drive through it's the same with sleeves and napkins. We run out or I forgot to put one on. If I don't point it out, the customer is happy and drives off. If I ask whether they want it, they always say yes.  
I'm not super into customer service, but I think it's important as well as consistency... but it's not that important during a huge rush at a fast food place. We need the DT time down, I don't want to mess up sequencing of the 3 drinks I'm making at once, etc. If things are slow, sure I'll make sure your order is perfect... but I can't help thinking that if you just hand off things confidently they'll almost never notice small mistakes. Hell, I was putting the fancy caramel sauce on all the caramel ribbon crunches for a months. Someone corrected me, and im not sure they were right, but none of the frappes got sent back whether i put the dark caramel sauce or the normal caramel drizzle. We're near a college so the worst most basic customers come through during rush anyway.  
What do you think? Should the hand-off person be checking quality, or should they just get the drinks out with a smile and then smooth things over if the customer points it out?

\--

If you manage someone else’s money in any shape or form, one requirement from the regulator is that you shouldn’t have defrauded anyone in the past. Sure, it’s basic, but it’s also tough to meet because there is a non-insignificant overlap between people that enjoy both fraud and managing other people’s money.

Earlier this month, SEBI [issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html) asking Embassy REIT to suspend its CEO Aravind Maiya. The reason being that Maiya had been caught up in an unrelated fraud from a few years back, and had also been debarred from being an auditor.

Until 2019 Maiya was an auditor at ~~KPMG~~ BSR & Co, which is an audit firm that most people recognise as KPMG India. At the time, BSR was the auditor for Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, the company owning the CCD brand. CCD’s owners turned out to have embezzled money from CCD to another company that they owned. Maiya was the guy responsible for ensuring that CCD’s financials, which was a publicly listed company, were correct.

Well, he did a horrible job.

# Draining out the coffee

Here’s a slightly dramatic look into one of the ways in which VG Siddhartha, the founder of CCD (who unfortunately killed himself) stole money from the company:

1. He kept a bunch of cheques in his table drawer. Each of those cheques were pre-signed by CCD’s CFO (and whoever else whose signature was needed to make a transaction).
2. Next he would draw a cheque for a few hundreds or thousands of crores in favour of a company called Mysore Amalgamated Coffee Estates. The company was owned by his dad. Supposedly, it sold coffee beans and that’s what CCD was paying for.
3. On his way back home from work, he likely dropped the cheque in his bank’s cheque deposit box.

Sure yes, he probably didn’t deposit his cheques himself and sent someone else to do it for him. But the idea is generally right. Here’s a couple of snippets from a SEBI order against CCD [from last year](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2023/order-in-the-matter-of-coffee-day-enterprises-ltd-_67495.html):

>I note that the Noticee has itself admitted that VGS, the Promoter and CEO, was running the entire show within CDEL and its subsidiaries. It has further admitted that VGS used to collect the signed blank cheques and all the fund transfers were done by him

And,

>CDEL in its submissions to SEBI had stated that CDGL had regular coffee procurement relationship with MACEL \[para 41(h)\]. The revenues of MACEL during 2018-19 and 2019-20 (the years during which the fund diversion to MACEL had occurred) were merely Rs.1.71 Crore and Rs.3.27 crore respectively… It is quite intriguing that despite the extremely weak financial position of MACEL, the subsidiaries of CDEL decided to advance funds to the tune of Rs. 3,535 Crore to MACEL. This sum was more than the net worth of the Noticee, Rs. 3166 Crore as of March 31, 2019.

Siddhartha signed off on cheques apparently to buy coffee beans. But the company he paid more than a thousand crores in advance to buy coffee beans from, had a revenue of less than a few crores.

How did he get away with it? That’s where Aravind Maiya, the ~~KP~~ BSR auditor comes in. Maiya, whose job it was to identify and catch shenanigans when auditing CCD’s books, apparently did not because Siddhartha hadn’t technically written those cheques from CCD’s chequebook. He had used the chequebook of its subsidiary!

Here’s a snippet [from](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf) the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), \[1\] an organisation I didn’t know existed before this:

>CDEL borrowed Rs 2,960 crores from Standard Chartered Bank, through its step down subsidiary TRRDPL, which was a 100% subsidiary of Tanglin Developments Limited.

>\[…\] the EP has stated that they were the Auditors of CDEL and not for the subsidiaries, and they relied upon the audit work and the audit reports issued by other statutory auditors of CDEL group entities as permitted by SA 600 (Using the Work of another auditor). He further stated that he had relied on certain additional audit procedures performed on identified account balances of CDGL and TDL which were considered important from the standpoint of consolidation.

One of CCD’s subsidiaries borrowed \~₹3,000 crore and lent a portion of it to Mysore Coffee (the company Siddhartha’s dad owned). Maiya told SEBI that since the money had gone out from CCD’s subsidiary, not CCD itself, and since those subsidiaries had their own auditors who found nothing wrong, it was okay for him to have the go ahead to CCD’s financials no matter how unusual they might seem.

In another case, CCD was lending money to one of its subsidiaries in a.. peculiar manner. Here’s a bank statement from NFRA’s [order](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf):

Image link: [https://imgur.com/a/jote6GT](https://imgur.com/a/jote6GT)

Whoo, that’s quite some back and forth of money! CCD wanted to move money to its then-subsidiary Tanglin Developments. \[2\] So it lent it money. Tanglin repaid that money the same year, which in the world of finance is a great sign. But then CCD would just re-lend the money back to Tanglin in a couple of days. Eventually of course, that money would find its way to Mysore Coffee. Until the next time Tanglin’s loan from its parent company had to be “repaid”.

I’m not an auditor, probably for good reason, but if I saw a bank statement with a +₹50 crore almost immediately followed by -₹50 crore repeated a few times and even across bank accounts, I would be alarmed. From NFRA again:

>\[…\] the EP \[Maiya\] stated that he did not review the transactions between CDEL and TDL in the manner NFRA has considered, as the money was advanced and returned during the year and these transactions were eliminated during consolidation, TDL being a wholly owned subsidiary.

NFRA feels that Maiya’s responsibility was to ask CCD, “Hey why are you sending money back and forth to your subsidiary?” Maybe there was a perfectly reasonable answer to this question (rewards on Google Pay?). But not finding the transactions suspicious was suspicious.

# FIT AND PROPER

If you were a board member at a real estate investment trust (REIT), one of the things that you may want to do is to keep your REIT away from any shady people. Sure, you want to be doing that regardless, but especially if you’re around a REIT. Real estate in India is shady! The calling card for REITs mentions that people shouldn’t invest in them without getting their hands burnt.

Here are Aravind Maiya’s qualifications:

1. Found guilty of professional misconduct by NFRA.
2. Debarred from being an auditor.
3. Penalty of ₹50 lakh ($60, 000).

Would you hire him as your REIT’s CEO? Maybe you have no idea about all of this and let’s say you do. If the regulator comes to you and specifically asks you to reconsider his eligibility—what do you do?

This is what Embassy REIT did. From SEBI’s [recent order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html):

>REIT Regulations do not specify any criteria or requirements of the CEO of a manager to a REIT and do not provide any 'fit and proper person' criteria for the CEO of the manager of the REIT.

SEBI wanted the REIT’s CEO to be a “fit and proper person” which is just a bunch of [floor criteria](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/aug-2022/securities-and-exchange-board-of-india-intermediaries-regulations-2008-last-amended-on-august-1-2022-_61700.html) for stuff like not having defrauded anyone or being a criminal. Embassy REIT’s argument was that its CEO doesn’t need to be a “fit and proper person”?!

I know no one reads SEBI orders so Embassy REIT didn’t really care about what showed up in SEBI’s order. But come on, arguing that your CEO doesn’t need to be fit and proper is courageous. If it was up to me, I’d publish this line on the front page of whatever business newspaper I could. (The best I can do at the moment is the title of this blog post.)

Eventually, of course, Embassy REIT had to ask Aravind Maiya to step down because SEBI didn’t give it an option. What do you think Embassy asked Maiya to do? *My* presumption was that it would ask him to go on sabbatical, or I don’t know, maybe pick up gardening as a hobby.

Here’s a snippet from its [official statement](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/380f6cc3-3794-4937-9393-5b009eb08174.pdf):

>While we are reviewing the order and evaluating all options, in compliance with SEBI’s directive, effective immediately, Aravind Maiya will be stepping down as CEO of Embassy REIT. He will assume the role of Head of Strategy for Embassy REIT.

HE WILL ASSUME THE ROLE OF WHAT? When the regulator asks you to chuck your CEO out, you chuck your CEO out! You don’t give him a proxy CEO position as head of “strategy”. \[3\]

I have a hunch that someone at SEBI is now writing another order about how the head of strategy at a REIT should also be fit and proper. This time around they might cover more job titles.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] SEBI and NFRA worked together on this entire thing. First, SEBI investigated CCD and found that things were off. Then NFRA investigated Maiya, who was CCD’s auditor, because things were so *bizarrely* off. Then SEBI issued the most recent order asking Embassy REIT to ask Aravind Maiya to step down as the CEO because NFRA found him guilty.

# Introduction

In the constant quest for a healthy and efficient weight loss solution, Java Burn has emerged as a popular choice. This coffee additive promises to supercharge your metabolism and accelerate your journey towards achieving your fitness goals. But with a market saturated with weight loss supplements, can Java Burn truly deliver on its claims? This comprehensive review aims to dissect the facts surrounding Java Burn coffee reviews, analyze its potential benefits, and guide you towards making an informed decision.  

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a dietary supplement packaged in individual serving packets designed to be mixed with your daily cup of coffee. The official website touts a proprietary blend of natural ingredients scientifically formulated to support weight management.  

# Delving into the Ingredients

Understanding the ingredients in Java Burn is crucial for assessing its potential effectiveness and safety. While the complete ingredient list is not readily available, the official website highlights some key components:

* **Green Tea Extract:** A well-known source of antioxidants, green tea extract boasts potential metabolism-boosting properties.  
* **Chromium:** This essential mineral plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels, which may indirectly contribute to weight management.
* **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid is involved in transporting fatty acids for energy production, potentially influencing fat burning.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Unroasted green coffee beans contain chlorogenic acid, which some studies suggest may aid in weight loss.

# Exploring the Potential Benefits of Java Burn

Java Burn reviews often highlight several potential benefits associated with this coffee additive. Let's delve deeper into some of these claims:

* **Enhanced Metabolism:** The blend of ingredients, particularly green tea extract and L-Carnitine, may contribute to an increase in metabolic rate. This translates to your body burning more calories throughout the day, potentially aiding weight loss.  
* **Increased Energy Levels:** The combination of caffeine from your coffee and potential metabolic effects of Java Burn could result in heightened energy levels, keeping you active and motivated throughout the day.  
* **Appetite Suppression:** Some Java Burn reviews mention a reduction in cravings, which could be attributed to the presence of ingredients that promote satiety or influence blood sugar regulation.  
* **Improved Focus and Concentration:** Enhanced energy levels coupled with potential cognitive benefits from green tea extract could lead to increased focus and concentration, aiding overall productivity.  
* **Overall Wellness Boost:** With its blend of antioxidants and potentially metabolism-boosting ingredients, Java Burn might contribute to a general sense of well-being. However, it's crucial to remember that Java Burn is not a magic bullet.

# Examining the Science Behind Java Burn

While Java Burn reviews often paint a promising picture, it's important to critically analyze the scientific evidence supporting its claims. Unfortunately, at this point, limited independent research exists specifically on Java Burn.

However, some of the individual ingredients, like green tea extract and L-Carnitine, have garnered some scientific support for their potential role in weight management. However, the research is often inconclusive and may require higher doses than what might be present in a single serving of Java Burn.

# A Look at User Reviews: Success Stories and Skepticism

Java Burn reviews on the internet are a mixed bag. Some users report positive experiences, highlighting increased energy levels, improved weight management results, and a positive impact on their overall well-being.  

On the other hand, some reviews express skepticism about the product's effectiveness, with users reporting minimal to no change in weight or other claimed benefits. It's important to consider that individual experiences may vary based on factors like overall diet, exercise routine, and body composition.

# Safety Considerations and Potential Side Effects

As with any supplement, it's vital to understand the potential side effects of Java Burn. Since the full ingredient list is not readily available, potential risks are difficult to assess accurately.

However, some common side effects associated with certain ingredients, such as green tea extract or caffeine, include:

* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Upset stomach
* Headaches

# Who Should Consider Trying Java Burn?

Java Burn might be an option for individuals seeking a natural weight management solution alongside a healthy diet and exercise routine. However, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before adding any supplement to your regimen, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking medications.

# Who Should Avoid Java Burn?

Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and those taking prescription medications should not use Java Burn without professional guidance. Additionally, individuals sensitive to caffeine or green tea extract should use caution.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):

1. **Is Java Burn safe to consume?** While Java Burn is generally considered safe for most people, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
2. **How long does it take to see results with Java Burn?** Individual results may vary. Some users report noticeable changes within a few weeks, while others may take longer. It's important to maintain a consistent routine of using Java Burn alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise.  
3. **Can I use Java Burn with other supplements?** It's advisable to consult with your healthcare provider to ensure that combining Java Burn with other supplements or medications is safe and won't cause any adverse interactions.
4. **Is Java Burn suitable for vegetarians or vegans?** The specific ingredients in Java Burn and their sources may vary. It's recommended to check the product label or contact the manufacturer to confirm its suitability for vegetarian or vegan diets.
5. **How should I store Java Burn?** To maintain the product's potency, store Java Burn in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and excessive heat.

# Conclusion: A Balanced Perspective

Java Burn, with its blend of natural ingredients, presents an intriguing option for individuals seeking to support their weight loss goals. However, it's crucial to approach it with realistic expectations and a balanced perspective. While some users report positive results, it's important to remember that individual experiences may vary.

Ultimately, the key to sustainable weight loss lies in a holistic approach that combines a healthy diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle modifications. While Java Burn may offer additional support, it's not a magic solution.

Before incorporating Java Burn or any other supplement into your routine, consult with a healthcare professional to ensure it aligns with your specific needs and health goals.

My (20m) mom (63f) had a stroke Friday and while I don’t feel like leaving the whole summary here.. I think I am finding that I’m grieving her despite her being alive? I feel guilt too. I should be happy that she survived, walk, can speak, and knows how to eat and use the bathroom but unlike others who experience strokes but.. I am really struggling. She came home from the hospital yesterday, and no advice was really given other than the specialists she needs to see. It’s really tough seeing how much she’s mentally changed and how, even though she may recover, she’s never going to be the same again. I suppose it helps that my sister and dad are there help, but I’m finding it difficult to be.. around her too long? I don’t know how to explain it. I’m genuinely so grateful for her but it’s hard to see her struggle to color. To see her forget her phone she just sat down. For her to not be able to make her coffee like she used to, confused by the tv, falling asleep sitting up.. and just, her new childlike demeanor and innocence. In one way it’s really sweet but on the other hand it’s like I need my mom and she’s here but not really. I feel guilty though because I want to celebrate her as is but change is so hard, and she’s so sick (respiratory failure, copd, hole in heart… so I almost feel scared to be too hopeful. I don’t know where to put my feelings. I can mostly manage but small things make me start sobbing and then I cry.. and then I’m good again. I feel numb, still. It’s also difficult because most people reaching out are sorry but since she’s alive and talking they think it’s all fine, and I don’t blame others but.. I don’t know. 5 minutes with her and you can see how different things are. This hurts so so much.

I have seizures and am unable to drive. My parents visit them pretty much every week and take care my nephew after school.  I can't go visit him often because I am pretty much bed ridden. I can barely leave the house, I do my job and sleep. I can't even shop at the grocery store because I'll pass out or possibly seize in the aisle. It's not worth risking that. I don't really go anywhere other than to drive thru and get coffee with my dad. 

If I'm honest, I don't really like kids because I just don't have the energy for them. My sister and I aren't on great terms because she screamed a lot and threw temper tantrums, as a teen, when I was young. This happened when I was 5 to 8 years old.

\--

If you manage someone else’s money in any shape or form, one requirement from the regulator is that you shouldn’t have defrauded anyone in the past. Sure, it’s basic, but it’s also tough to meet because there is a non-insignificant overlap between people that enjoy both fraud and managing other people’s money.

Earlier this month, SEBI [issued an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html) asking Embassy REIT to suspend its CEO Aravind Maiya. The reason being that Maiya had been caught up in an unrelated fraud from a few years back, and had also been debarred from being an auditor.

Until 2019 Maiya was an auditor at ~~KPMG~~ BSR & Co, which is an audit firm that most people recognise as KPMG India. At the time, BSR was the auditor for Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, the company owning the CCD brand. CCD’s owners turned out to have embezzled money from CCD to another company that they owned. Maiya was the guy responsible for ensuring that CCD’s financials, which was a publicly listed company, were correct.

Well, he did a horrible job.

# Draining out the coffee

Here’s a slightly dramatic look into one of the ways in which VG Siddhartha, the founder of CCD (who unfortunately killed himself) stole money from the company:

1. He kept a bunch of cheques in his table drawer. Each of those cheques were pre-signed by CCD’s CFO (and whoever else whose signature was needed to make a transaction).
2. Next he would draw a cheque for a few hundreds or thousands of crores in favour of a company called Mysore Amalgamated Coffee Estates. The company was owned by his dad. Supposedly, it sold coffee beans and that’s what CCD was paying for.
3. On his way back home from work, he likely dropped the cheque in his bank’s cheque deposit box.

Sure yes, he probably didn’t deposit his cheques himself and sent someone else to do it for him. But the idea is generally right. Here’s a couple of snippets from a SEBI order against CCD [from last year](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jan-2023/order-in-the-matter-of-coffee-day-enterprises-ltd-_67495.html):

>I note that the Noticee has itself admitted that VGS, the Promoter and CEO, was running the entire show within CDEL and its subsidiaries. It has further admitted that VGS used to collect the signed blank cheques and all the fund transfers were done by him

And,

>CDEL in its submissions to SEBI had stated that CDGL had regular coffee procurement relationship with MACEL \[para 41(h)\]. The revenues of MACEL during 2018-19 and 2019-20 (the years during which the fund diversion to MACEL had occurred) were merely Rs.1.71 Crore and Rs.3.27 crore respectively… It is quite intriguing that despite the extremely weak financial position of MACEL, the subsidiaries of CDEL decided to advance funds to the tune of Rs. 3,535 Crore to MACEL. This sum was more than the net worth of the Noticee, Rs. 3166 Crore as of March 31, 2019.

Siddhartha signed off on cheques apparently to buy coffee beans. But the company he paid more than a thousand crores in advance to buy coffee beans from, had a revenue of less than a few crores.

How did he get away with it? That’s where Aravind Maiya, the ~~KP~~ BSR auditor comes in. Maiya, whose job it was to identify and catch shenanigans when auditing CCD’s books, apparently did not because Siddhartha hadn’t technically written those cheques from CCD’s chequebook. He had used the chequebook of its subsidiary!

Here’s a snippet [from](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf) the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), \[1\] an organisation I didn’t know existed before this:

>CDEL borrowed Rs 2,960 crores from Standard Chartered Bank, through its step down subsidiary TRRDPL, which was a 100% subsidiary of Tanglin Developments Limited.

>\[…\] the EP has stated that they were the Auditors of CDEL and not for the subsidiaries, and they relied upon the audit work and the audit reports issued by other statutory auditors of CDEL group entities as permitted by SA 600 (Using the Work of another auditor). He further stated that he had relied on certain additional audit procedures performed on identified account balances of CDGL and TDL which were considered important from the standpoint of consolidation.

One of CCD’s subsidiaries borrowed \~₹3,000 crore and lent a portion of it to Mysore Coffee (the company Siddhartha’s dad owned). Maiya told SEBI that since the money had gone out from CCD’s subsidiary, not CCD itself, and since those subsidiaries had their own auditors who found nothing wrong, it was okay for him to have the go ahead to CCD’s financials no matter how unusual they might seem.

In another case, CCD was lending money to one of its subsidiaries in a.. peculiar manner. Here’s a bank statement from NFRA’s [order](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e2ad76f2326fbc6b56a45a56c59fafdb/uploads/2024/08/202408191036463933.pdf):

https://preview.redd.it/c0xsisenma3e1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=928fb1e765833a9d7627ec38d273bb2e3f320847

Whoo, that’s quite some back and forth of money! CCD wanted to move money to its then-subsidiary Tanglin Developments. \[2\] So it lent it money. Tanglin repaid that money the same year, which in the world of finance is a great sign. But then CCD would just re-lend the money back to Tanglin in a couple of days. Eventually of course, that money would find its way to Mysore Coffee. Until the next time Tanglin’s loan from its parent company had to be “repaid”.

I’m not an auditor, probably for good reason, but if I saw a bank statement with a +₹50 crore almost immediately followed by -₹50 crore repeated a few times and even across bank accounts, I would be alarmed. From NFRA again:

>\[…\] the EP \[Maiya\] stated that he did not review the transactions between CDEL and TDL in the manner NFRA has considered, as the money was advanced and returned during the year and these transactions were eliminated during consolidation, TDL being a wholly owned subsidiary.

NFRA feels that Maiya’s responsibility was to ask CCD, “Hey why are you sending money back and forth to your subsidiary?” Maybe there was a perfectly reasonable answer to this question (rewards on Google Pay?). But not finding the transactions suspicious was suspicious.

# FIT AND PROPER

If you were a board member at a real estate investment trust (REIT), one of the things that you may want to do is to keep your REIT away from any shady people. Sure, you want to be doing that regardless, but especially if you’re around a REIT. Real estate in India is shady! The calling card for REITs mentions that people shouldn’t invest in them without getting their hands burnt.

Here are Aravind Maiya’s qualifications:

1. Found guilty of professional misconduct by NFRA.
2. Debarred from being an auditor.
3. Penalty of ₹50 lakh ($60, 000).

Would you hire him as your REIT’s CEO? Maybe you have no idea about all of this and let’s say you do. If the regulator comes to you and specifically asks you to reconsider his eligibility—what do you do?

This is what Embassy REIT did. From SEBI’s [recent order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/nov-2024/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-embassy-office-parks-management-services-private-limited_88223.html):

>REIT Regulations do not specify any criteria or requirements of the CEO of a manager to a REIT and do not provide any 'fit and proper person' criteria for the CEO of the manager of the REIT.

SEBI wanted the REIT’s CEO to be a “fit and proper person” which is just a bunch of [floor criteria](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/aug-2022/securities-and-exchange-board-of-india-intermediaries-regulations-2008-last-amended-on-august-1-2022-_61700.html) for stuff like not having defrauded anyone or being a criminal. Embassy REIT’s argument was that its CEO doesn’t need to be a “fit and proper person”?!

I know no one reads SEBI orders so Embassy REIT didn’t really care about what showed up in SEBI’s order. But come on, arguing that your CEO doesn’t need to be fit and proper is courageous. If it was up to me, I’d publish this line on the front page of whatever business newspaper I could. (The best I can do at the moment is the title of this blog post.)

Eventually, of course, Embassy REIT had to ask Aravind Maiya to step down because SEBI didn’t give it an option. What do you think Embassy asked Maiya to do? *My* presumption was that it would ask him to go on sabbatical, or I don’t know, maybe pick up gardening as a hobby.

Here’s a snippet from its [official statement](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/380f6cc3-3794-4937-9393-5b009eb08174.pdf):

>While we are reviewing the order and evaluating all options, in compliance with SEBI’s directive, effective immediately, Aravind Maiya will be stepping down as CEO of Embassy REIT. He will assume the role of Head of Strategy for Embassy REIT.

HE WILL ASSUME THE ROLE OF WHAT? When the regulator asks you to chuck your CEO out, you chuck your CEO out! You don’t give him a proxy CEO position as head of “strategy”. \[3\]

I have a hunch that someone at SEBI is now writing another order about how the head of strategy at a REIT should also be fit and proper. This time around they might cover more job titles.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] SEBI and NFRA worked together on this entire thing. First, SEBI investigated CCD and found that things were off. Then NFRA investigated Maiya, who was CCD’s auditor, because things were so *bizarrely* off. Then SEBI issued the most recent order asking Embassy REIT to ask Aravind Maiya to step down as the CEO because NFRA found him guilty.

\[2\] CCD eventually [sold](https://www.thenewsminute.com/money/coffee-day-sells-global-village-techpark-bengaluru-rs-2700-crore-109101) Tanglin Developments to Blackstone.

Which makes Embassy REIT’s hesitance to let go of its CEO seem even more interesting.

1h0jkbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1h0jkbh/struggling_1_year_after_going_nc/,Struggling 1 year after going NC,"As the title says, I (36 m) went NC with my nfather after last Thanksgiving went horribly wrong and another big blowup of his over nothing made me realize I want nothing to do with this man. That was an easy part, and quite frankly I have not missed him once since. There wasn’t a moment when I looked back and regretted my decision to cut ties with him, or when I wished I was in touch with him for whatever reason. My parents live about 500 miles away so not seeing them is quite easy.
The hard part is dealing with my emother. I was naive enough to try to have a relationship with her after I went NC with nfather. And at first she appeared to understand but the tune changed quickly as it became clear I am not willing to reconcile this time. Guilt tripping and emotional manipulation started to creep in. 
It started to really wear on me around March of this year. I was going to be in their city for unrelated reasons later that spring, and asked my emother if she wants to meet for a coffee. The first words out of her mouth were “can your father come too”. That’s when I knew I will probably have to give up on the relationship with her as well. Then in April he had to go to the hospital for a minor surgery, of course it was the end of the world, and she pressured me into promising I will reconcile with him. Instant regret, the next day when I learned everything went fine and he is recovering I told her listen, I cannot continue to have a relationship with either of you anymore, wish you all the best, please do not contact me. Both numbers blocked. 
I struggled a lot with guilt and grief after that happened and still do. I was in such a poor mental state I almost lost my job; thankfully the worst is over now and I am back to normal functioning in my daily life. She left me a couple of voicemails and each one sent me into a spiral so I just disabled the voicemail feature on my phone. Hopefully now I can enjoy some peace.
I don’t want to reconcile. The time for that passed a long time ago. He will never change from being an immature, self absorbed, emotionally and physically abusive individual. She will never put me first and his needs will always be ahead of mine. In my rational mind I get that. Emotionally, I am in a lot of pain. My partner is my primary support and I do see a therapist, but outside of that I don’t have a robust support network. I am NC or VLC with all my relatives, most of whom live half way across the world. My partner is understandably tired of be in a primary support, and he has been my rock through several big things in the last three years. I don’t have close friends right now that I can go to with this. So I just want to turn here for some support and advice because I am tired of dealing with this alone. 
Was NC the right thing to do? Absolutely. I intend to stay no contact in the foreseeable future as well. However, the challenges are also real. The grief, the sadness, the anger, the guilt can all be overwhelming. Grief for things that happened and grief for things I haven’t. Realizing my parents will never be what I needed them to be all these years. It’s a lot. So just wanted to post here and ask for support.

But the changes that this school has made to the cafeteria are genuinely shameful and are a slap in the face to the entire student body. First, I want to say that the cafeteria employees are incredibly lovely people who deserve nothing but the best and work hard every day to make good food for us. For the past two years, I've used the cafeteria regularly for lunch and have been pretty satisfied with the food options. But in the past month, the school has effectively stripped the cafeteria's operations down to nothing. 

As part of their new ""meal plan"" for the cafeteria, the school has removed: the chili, the soup of the day, most of the grill options, many of the sandwich options including breads and condiments, the cold food options, amongst many more changes.  They've also shortened the hours of the cafeteria, which now closes at 130 pm (even if you want coffee or tea!). Additionally, even the 2 or 3 food options the cafeteria has left now run out regularly due to decreased stock, making the cafeteria close even earlier than the shortened hours. So if you have class until 1, you're basically out of luck in terms of being able to eat. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if there were plentiful food options near school, but everyone knows that the closest walking food option to the school is about a 30 minute round trip! 

For students who don't have time to cook, that have families or work outside of school that don't have time to prepare themselves lunch everyday, the school is effectively telling them that they won't be able to eat lunch on a regular basis. It's honestly despicable. We pay $75,000 a year in tuition. The school has an $800 million endowment. We have enough money to do a stupid renovation of student affairs (and remove the main staircase to Slaughter for some idiotic reason). And yet they can't even give us decent food that we have to pay for anyway. The idea that they needed to do this to save money is laughable. The school should honestly be ashamed of themselves and something should be done.",23,1732647208.0,UVALaw,6,1.0,False

Context: we adopted our first cat two months ago from a rescue org that said she was “good with dogs” (no further details though). She’s around a year old and generally very chill and sweet. We did our best to research all the “right” things when introducing her to our dog, a 4-year-old mutt: no contact for the first few days, then only seeing each other through a gate, then slowly allowing them to be in the same room while keeping the dog on leash, etc. Now they can both wander around the home unsupervised. Mostly they ignore each other, or they’ll “greet” each other with a quick sniff (kinda cute!), but there are times when the dog just keeps sniffing all over her until she gets annoyed and scampers off to higher ground or a different room. Nothing crazy, and we have intervened if she seemed particularly uncomfortable. 

Last night, though, things escalated quickly. I was watching TV with the cat purring on my lap and the dog came over. He sniffed her face for a couple seconds and initially she seemed fine, but then as he walked away I noticed her trying to swat at him a couple times. I yelled “hey!” (in retrospect, a mistake), and then chaos ensued. She jumped off my lap and scrambled under the coffee table, he whipped around and started barking and growling and cornering her so we put them in separate rooms for a while to cool down. I felt bad: she let out some low and long meows afterwards so she must’ve been pretty distressed, and our dog is not a barker so he must’ve been pretty upset too… but I also couldn’t understand why she was trying to swat him since he was already walking away! In fact, I don’t even think the dog noticed anything until I yelled. 

So like… 1.) why did she do that? Is she getting territorial (about me? The couch?)? Did she just have some built up resentment that I wasn’t clued in on? Do I just need to be more vigilant? Was she seriously trying to hurt him (if so she was pretty ineffective since I don’t think she made any contact)?

And 2.) what can I do to avoid this? We’ve been putting almost all our attention on training the dog to be more respectful of her boundaries because, well, he’s a dog and can be trained (and let’s face it, he’s usually the instigator even if he doesn’t mean to be). But this time… I mean I kinda feel like she was lashing out with very little provocation.",1,1732647055.0,CatAdvice,5,0.67,False

Proof: 90

Age: NAS

Mashbill: 100% malted barley including a combination of applewood smoked, coffee kilned and crystal malts. 

Finish: DFH barrel honey rum cask

Nose: Light ethanol and candied apples. Slight molasses/brown sugar from the rum cask but just a hint. 

Palate: honey, green apples, brown sugar, touch of smoke with a light ethanol heat. Very much leaning towards the sweeter side. 

Finish: light ethanol heat that dissipates quickly. Pretty tame. 

Overall: Nothing fantastic or mind blowing going on here. You certainly get the rum influence but that flavor profile is very toned down. You get some characteristics of a single malt but they’re also toned down. It pulls off being sweet while also being light and not overly cloying. But that’s all it really has going for it. Might be worth picking up in the mid $30’s range or lower. Otherwise, pass on this.

It was very easy talking to him, conversation was flowing well and we had some things in common. 
Things felt like they were going well until I notice he checks his watch, which I didn’t think much of because he had limited time to meet me. I asked him if he needed to go and he said “Is there anything else you need to chitchat about?” I said no and if he needed to go back to work I didn’t want to make him get in trouble.
We awkwardly said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. 

When I got home I thanked him and told him it was very nice meeting him. 
He said the following: “I had a nice time meeting you too! You’re very attractive and I appreciate your candour. I felt like the conversation flowed easily. I’m so impressed a lot of things about you! I like to take some time to reflect after a date before I decide on the next steps but I just wanted to give you that feedback early”

I pretty much answered that I felt the same way and that I completely understood that he needed time to reflect and have him his space.

I was greeted this morning by the results after his deliberation. He pretty much said exactly the same as what he said yesterday, but then added “on reflecting on it though, I’m not sure I’m feeling the connection I’m looking for”.

I recently had an incident at a small coffee shop parking lot in Texas. There was a concrete parking bar that wasn’t in the correct place at the top of the parking spot—it was slanted and pulled into the parking space. A piece of rebar was sticking out of it, and when I pulled in, it caught my bumper and pulled it down. Now my car bumper is dragging, and the damage is significant.

I documented the scene with photos and reported the issue to the coffee shop manager. They gave me an email address to contact someone about it. I reached out, and the person called me back, saying they don’t think they’re liable. I asked them to put that in writing via email, but I haven’t heard back yet.

I’m trying to figure out:

1. Is the coffee shop (or property owner) liable for the damage?
2. What’s the best way to pursue this—through insurance, small claims court, or another route?
3. Do I need a specific type of lawyer for this situation?

I’d love to hear from anyone who has dealt with something similar or has legal/insurance advice, especially in Texas. Any tips on how to approach this or handle communication with the coffee shop would be appreciated!

Flashback, Part 3:

I closed my eyes. It was easy, because my head felt like it was floating, fuzzy and twisty and relaxed. I was stressed when I heard, “wake up, Grandma,” and that sent a jolt through my chest. I stood, but my legs were like thick, wet concrete, and I wanted to sit again, but heard “you can’t, Grandma.” I was annoyed, but wouldn’t ignore Michael’s request. I was wobbly and nauseated when I got to my feet. But he was calling from inside the kitchen, so I followed where I knew he was, just out of sight. Walking was hard, keeping a straight line was impossible, but I kept putting one foot in front of the other as I moved through the kitchen. He was right ahead of me, out of sight. Through the narrow hallway, out the back door.

Into bright sunlight.

I blinked and felt sick. Why was I doing this? I knew I was outside, in the back of the tea shop. Right near where I had laid Michael in the shade.

Michael. I had to get to him, he was nearby. He’d called me out of the shop.

My stomach lurched. No, my grandson was dead. 

I blinked and walked to the place in the shade where he liked to lie in the grass. I knew that sitting was bad; for some reason, I had to stay awake when no one else was.

Even when all I wanted was to close my eyes. 

I remembered the rest like a mirage evaporating. None of the details mattered after knowing that Michael was gone, though, because for a moment, I could almost reach him. 

I wondered if the men inside were alive. I wondered if I could get in trouble for their deaths. 

I didn’t care. Not really. 

So I walked away from my little tea shop, out into the fresh air and sunlight. For some reason, I think Michael would have wanted that.

*

I wandered back a while later, because there was nowhere else to go. I figured I’d burned my own world down, so I might as well see the fireworks before the police dragged me away forever. 

So I held my breath and turned the final corner. What would I see? A squadron of police, ready to shoot me on sight?

I peeked around the edge.

Nothing. The shop sat placidly under a bright blue sky, cheerily awaiting customers who weren’t there. 

Apparently, the outside world keeps spinning even when ours has stopped.

That realization set in motion everything that came next. It’s the reason that I went back inside, held my breath, and shut off the gas. It’s why I didn’t stare in fear at the three unmoving men with blue lips laying on my couch and chairs. And that’s what drove me to open the windows of my shop, letting the bad air out and the good air in as though I actually believed tomorrow might be a better day. 

I took another walk while the carbon monoxide cleared out of my tea shop.

*

The dead men were still in my parlor when I returned. I don’t know why I thought that might change. It’s funny what we tell ourselves in order to endure knowing that everything we love will one day be destroyed.

I figured I should probably move the corpses off my chair, but I decided to make some black tea instead. It’s lively and robust, you know; it should be steeped for a minimum of four minutes near boiling. It’s not as caffeinated as coffee, but gives far more of a kick than anything green or white.

These thoughts were on my mind as I sat back down next to the dead man. The son of a bitch had received a much more peaceful ending than the one he’d bestowed upon my grandson, but I learned long ago to stop waiting for the world to be fair. 

I sipped my tea. 

My eyes wandered from his frozen face to the suitcase that he’d left on the floor. I placed my cup on the table, picked it up, and opened it. 

Ten stacks of crisp $100 bills sat in neat rows. A quick estimate confirmed that there were about fifty in each stack. 

Fifty thousand dollars, just as promised.

Far more than the $19.13 I’d earned the previous day from selling tea.

I closed the suitcase and set it quietly aside. 

My gaze drifted to an enormous duffel bag that sat between the two larger men. I stood, pulled my cardigan closer about my shoulders (something about their dead bodies made me feel so chilly!), and lifted the bag onto an empty chair. My, it was heavy. But I had to move it, because I’m past the age where I can kneel or squat on the floor and expect to have the ability to stand afterwards. 

I unzipped it to find several bricks of white power inside. Each was wrapped in some sort of plastic. I’d never seen such a thing before, but I’ve been around the block once or twice and figured that this was a bag of drugs. There were eight bricks, and each one was pretty heavy, so I assumed that each one was enough all by itself to get a person completely drugged. 

Then the bell above my door chimed its happy little tinkle. I turned around as five strange men with guns walked inside my tea shop.",7,1732646711.0,ByfelsDisciple,1,0.9,False

I have been asked out, so obviously some women do this and I know it happens. This is about a facet of the greater discussion I see on this topic.

The ""why don't women ask men out more"" thing comes up frequently, and I see a lot of women in the comments defaulting to a deflection about ""safety.""

But here's the thing: it isn't about asking out every man you see, or chatting up strangers in the bus stop. I'm talking about the scenario where **you are already interested in a guy, and 100% would say ""yes"" to him if *he* asked *you* out.**

Here's a scenario: Jen gets coffee at a local cafe 3-5 times per week. Twice a week on average, she sees Chris in there doing the same thing. They have exchanged small talk in line, but no serious conversations. Jen thinks Chris is really cute and wishes he would make a move.

Version A) Chris picks up on Jen's interest in him and invites her to get lunch with him that weekend at a restaurant he mentions.

Version B) Jen makes the first move and asks Chris to come meet her at nearby boardwalk for ice cream.

In no interpretation of this is it ""less safe"" for B to happen than A. If anything, B is actually safer since Jen can choose a familiar location and be more in control of her surroundings and the environment. This is even more true if either date might involve alcohol.

In other words, it is exactly the same amount of safe/unsafe to *agree to a date* as it is *to ask someone out on one.*

So why do so many women fall back to parroting lines about safety and bringing up irrelevant points about strange men making them feel uncomfortable? Not denying that that IS a thing, it just has nothing to do with the topic at hand.  ""Just ask HIM out"" isn't about forcing women to go after men they don't want, or be in situations they don't want to be. It's about removing the social paradigm that it's somehow the man's responsibility to make the first move and women's obligation to ""drop hints"" instead of being direct and taking equal responsibility in getting the ball rolling.

I find myself trying to do the morning dishes, clean up the kitchen, get both baby and toddlers teeth brushed, etc and getting frustrated that toddler is jumping off furniture, throwing items, using hot wheel tracks as a baseball bat, etc. I know that if I had ~30 minutes to myself to drink my coffee in the morning and prepare for the day it would go smoother but I find it really hard to get up at 5am or sometimes earlier to do that before my toddler gets up, especially when baby is still getting up at night.

[https://cinematicdiversions.com/body-of-evidence-review/](https://cinematicdiversions.com/body-of-evidence-review/)

  
Body of Evidence (1992): 7 out of 10: A woman is on trial for seducing men to death. Will her lawyer get her off? Will she get him off? Stay tuned for the drama both inside and outside of the courtroom.

# The Case for the Prosecution:

Exhibit A: The courtroom scenes: AKA half the bloody movie. Body of Evidence is often considered an erotic thriller. However, it spends an amazing amount of time in the courtroom. Now, courtroom scenes can work in thrillers (see 1990s Presumed Innocent), but they should be to the point and thrilling. The scenes here are pointless, with half a dozen side characters introduced and then forgotten. It never feels like an actual trial. The judge allows so many shenanigans; she makes Judge Ito look like Judge Judy.

Exhibit B: Willem Dafoe: I genuinely like Willem Dafoe. But as the lead character in an erotic thriller? As Weird Al Yankovic wrote about Mr. Defoe in his song “Ode To A Superhero”

And he’s ridin’ around on that glider thing  
And he’s throwin’ that weird pumpkin bomb  
Yes, he’s wearin’ that dumb Power Rangers mask  
But he’s scarier without it on

Now If Willem Dafoe switched roles with Joe Mantegna as the prosecutor, that might have worked a lot better. Both are wonderful charismatic actors, but nobody wants to see Willem Dafoe’s O-face.

Exhibit C: Madonna: Madonna makes bad movies. This is a Madonna movie. Hence, this is a bad movie. Prosecution rests.

The prosecution is feeling a bit overconfident there and rested their case without mentioning Anne Archer’s performance or the horrifying screenplay.



# The Defense:

Exhibit A: Madonna: In 1992, naked Madonna was everywhere. People were buying $50 coffee books that consisted if nothing but pictures of her naked while hitchhiking. (This is true. Ask your cool aunt.) As Rosie O’Donnell said to her in A League of Their Own. “You think there are men in this country who ain’t seen your bosoms?” What a difference twenty-six years makes. We are not inundated with Madonna nowadays (naked or otherwise) so she seems fresh again. Also, she really isn’t bad in this movie considering the lines she is given. She certainly gives a better performance than Anne Archer.

Exhibit B: Erotic Thrillers: Erotic thrillers enjoyed a moment between Basic Instinct and Showgirls. We don’t see them like these anymore and haven’t for a long time. There were a lot of them during that time-period (Heck there were two with Billy Baldwin for God’s sake) So we often will revisit the lesser-known ones for some nostalgia much like future generations will watch Ant-Man and muse how they don’t make Superhero movies anymore.

Exhibit C: That one scene you forgot was in the movie: The defense is wheeling out a TV and DVD player. Looks like they will show a clip. The overconfident prosecution doesn’t object. Is that a young, naked Julianne Moore? Wow, that sex scene is so intense. Where did that come from and how did Madonna allow herself to be upstaged?



# The Verdict

The Verdict: In 2018, the defense wins. Time has been kind to this movie. I understand the panning this received when it hit the local cineplex in 1992. For one thing, Madonna and Julianne Moore fighting over Willem Dafoe sounds like a mental patient’s fan fiction. For another, this is a Netflix and chill movie, not something you want to see in a theater filled with suburban housewives and Paul Reubens. It is both as bad as you remember it, but somehow endlessly entertaining.

1h0iwzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/1h0iwzy/doki_doki_detective_agency_original_fanfic_by_me/,Doki Doki Detective Agency [Original Fanfic by me],"The rain pelts down on the window of my office harshly, like a thousand little baby hands trying desperately to get inside the cold room I sat in. The loud buzz of the rain soothes me the same way using sandpaper to dry yourself after a warm shower would. The only difference is that I haven't had a warm shower in so long from not paying the gas bill at home. Money is tight nowadays, tighter than the knot on my tie that I loosen up every couple of minutes because it just keeps riding up.

I loosen up my tie and sigh, taking out my pack of cigarettes and lighting one with a match, eager to at least have the warm smoke in my lungs to feel any semblance of warmth on this cold, rainy night.

“Moni,” says Yuri, my faithful secretary, as she enters my office. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious. “There is someone that needs your services.”

“Tell ‘em I stopped doing sock puppets after the Sock Puppet Massacre from two years ago.” Seventeen people had their hands chopped off while they were wearing sock puppets. I almost lost my hand searching for the criminal scum that did that, but thankfully, I was wearing a stocking puppet. The perfect bait. Sadly, the Sock Puppet Murderer didn’t take it, and I was left with an unsolved case and a bad case of athlete's foot on my hand.

“No, I mean he’s looking for a PI.”

“Then tell ‘em the bathroom is the second door on the hallway to his left, upstairs in the basement.”

“Alright.” Yuri turns around and leaves me, just like my wife and children... Took everything when she left. She took the deed to the house we had bought right after marrying, the car we bought right after we got engaged, the 42 inch OLED display we got when we started dating, and the collection of stamps we got when we met. She even took my birth certificate, just because we were born on the same hospital. God, I miss my wife.

“Moni,” says Yuri, my unfaithful secretary, as she enters my office once again. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious. “The man says he needs a god-damn mother fucking detective to help him solve a case.”

“That would be me, then.” I snuff out the cigarette in my lips over my ashtray. “Tell him to come in. And bring the others.”

“Sure.” Yuri turns around and leaves me, just like my best friend... We spent two years in the army, inseparable like a superglued hand on the ass of an elephant. Had to choose whether to cut the elephant’s ass or my hand. Sometimes, I still feel that elephant’s skin on my hand, so warm and coarse... Just like my ex-wife’s... God, I miss my wife.

“Hey, boss.” Says Natsuki, one of my partners in this agency, as she enters my office. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious. “Yuri said you needed us.”

“Heya, Monika.” Says Sayori, one of my other partners in this agency, as she enters my office. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious.

“Please sit, we have a new client.” The girls sit down on a nearby couch, with Natsuki taking from her suit a packet of cigarettes and lights one up. Sayori follows, taking Natsuki’s lit cigarette and putting it on her lips, while also lighting up another cigarette from her own packet and giving it to Natsuki.

“Here.” I hear Yuri from outside the office. She knocks on the door. Mustn’t be important.

“Come in.” I say, and light a cigarette for myself, eager to once again feel the warm smoke inundating my lungs. Just like that time I drank coffee, and it went down the wrong pipe, inundating my lungs with that boiling hot goodness, permanently ruining my ability to discern smells. Everything smells like coffee now...

A man comes into the office, no younger than two years of age, and no older than eighty-nine. The perfect age to get married. My wife and I married young, hoping to build a future together with the passing of time. Should have known better... Who knew the state wouldn’t recognize a marriage between two kids in kindergarten. But our love was stronger than any laws, than any official documents.

Funny how fate twists and turns. First I break one or two laws for my happiness, and now chase those that break laws for the happiness of others. The only difference here is that I don’t gain any happiness from this.

“Hello.” Says the man and sits down on a chair before my desk. A whoopee cushion goes off, garnering the laughter of the other women in the room. The man looks down to his chair and finds nothing but the solid wooden surface.

“Sorry.” Yuri says, who sat down on another couch by the window. “These leather cushions always make that sound.”

They didn’t make that sound when Sayori and Natsuki sat down. Intriguing. I take my notebook out of my breast pocket, but I actually grabbed my packet of cigarettes. Whatever. I write on it what I just learned, that ‘leather cushions have selective farting abilities’.

“I need your help finding a missing person.” Says the man. “My name is Michael Cichael, and I’m looking for my sister, Ferlina Michaela Cichaela.”

Ferlina. That name rings a bell.

“She’s in the entrance.” I stand up to look outside the window, finding a woman ringing the office’s bell, eager to come in and guard herself from the torrential rain pouring over her. “WE ARE BUSY WITH ANOTHER CLIENT, FUCK OFF!”

“MY NAME IS FERLINA MICHAELA CICHAELA!” Says the woman looking up to me. “I NEED HELP FINDING MY BROTHER!”

“I SAID FUCK OFF!” I whip out my gun from my holster and shoot at her, making her run away from the gunfire and hide on a nearby dumpster. In time, a rubbish truck comes by and takes the dumpster and its insides with it, driving away into the night the same way my wife did to me. It was a rainy night, just like this one... God, I miss my wife.

“Anyway,” I come back into the office, closing the window behind me and lighting up a cigarette to replace the one the rain just ruined. “Tell me about this Ferlina gal.”

“She is my sister.” Says Michael Cichael, who, for the sake of getting over the stupid name the story just came up with, I’ll call MC. “She used to call me MC. I haven’t seen her in three minutes.”

“I see.” I take out my notepad and write down what I just learned. “And where was the last time you saw her?”

“Right outside this building.” MC says, lighting up a cigarette and taking a deep breath of it, desperation written on his face. “I told her to wait for me while I go in for help, and the next thing I know, she isn’t there with me.”

“I see.” I take out a handkerchief from my breast pocket and wipe the man’s face, erasing the ‘desperation’ written on his face. Sharpie marker. Fresh. Someone did this to him recently. That’s what it means for sharpie marker to be fresh... Interesting.

“Any place she used to frequent?” Asks Sayori from her seat on the couch, putting down a sharpie marker on the desk before her and taking her cigarette from the ashtray on the desk. “Any bar? Cabaret? Red zone brothel?”

“All of them, actually.” Says the man. “She has a part-time job as a rubbish collector, so she goes around those places collecting rubbish.”

“We know what a rubbish collector does, you dickhead.” Says Natsuki standing up from her seat to menacingly point a finger at the man. “What kind of idiots do you take us for, huh!?”

“N-No, I-I don’t think you’re idiots!” Says the man while raising his hands defensively before him. “I-I know you’re idiots!”

“That’s what I thought.” Natsuki sits back down on her seat. No whoopee cushion sound this time. Interesting. I take out my hand and write on it what I just learned. ‘Natsuki doesn’t fart’.

“Tell us about her. This, uh...” I put my pen on my lips and take a deep breath of its warm smoke. ”This sister of yours.” 

“She is a good girl.” The man says proudly. “She would never hurt anyone. She works part-time at the hospital as a nurse, and all the people that died under her care died of natural causes. Morphine overdose is a natural cause, right?”

“It is.” Yuri says, taking out a cigarette and lighting it up. “I have an uncle who died of morphine overdose in the hospital. Same exact conditions you tell me.”

“I’m so sorry.” Says the man, “I didn’t mean to bring bad memories.”

“It’s okay, don’t worry.” Yuri blows smoke through her nose. “He got better after all.”

“Focus, Michael!” This investigation is going nowhere! If I want answers, I might have to get my hands dirty. I reach out to firmly grasp MC’s shirt by the neck and lift him up to meet my eyes. “Tell me all you know about Ferlina!”

“I-I’ll talk! I’ll talk!” The man says and struggles to free himself from my grasp. “S-She has dark hair, she’s as tall as I am, she is sensible, romantic and loves long walks on the beach!”

“Do you know how little that narrows it down!?” I throw MC down on the chair, which cracks under his weight and breaks into pieces.

“Monika, calm down!” Sayori stands up from the couch and runs to hold me back. “It’s not worth killing the only witness we have!”

“No, you calm down!” I push Sayori from me, and she falls onto the ground, which cracks under her weight and breaks apart, letting her plummet onto the lower floor, which cracks under her weight and breaks apart, letting her plummet onto the lower floor, which cracks under her weight and breaks apart, letting her plummet onto the lower floor, which cracks under her weight and breaks apart, letting her plummet onto the lo-

“Tell me, Michael.” Yuri stands up and takes a cigarette from her own packet. But, instead of lighting it on by herself, she leans forward towards the man, cigarette between her lips. “Do you have a light?”

“S-Sure.” Michael takes from his pocket his phone and turns on the torch, lighting Yuri’s cigarette for her.

“Thank you.” Yuri blows out a cloud of smoke onto his face, making him cough severely and throw up in the hole Sayori left on the floor.

Allergic to smoke? Interesting. I take out my notepad and write down what I just learned.

“I think I have an idea where your sister is.” Natuski says from the corner of the room, face lit up only by the match on her hand. She lights up the fat cigar on her lips and blows the match off with the smoke. “I know a guy that has a store not far from here. Keevin. His brother Maurice runs an underground club, full of the worst kind of scum you would never wish to meet. In that club, there is a barista that goes by the name of Susan, but in reality she is the assassin Cutlass. She has done a bunch of dirty work for me back when I was her pimp. She has a cousin, known only by the nickname of Daniel. Daniel is a mystery enveloped in an enigma wrapped in a paradox with sprinkles of confusion and a side of secret French fries, all for $2.99 at the local riddle store.”

“And you think Daniel might know where Ferlina is?” Asks MC, eyes full of hope that he wipes away with a handkerchief. It is hope season after all. Perhaps he is allergic to hope instead of smoke? Was I wrong on my deduction? Heh... I really am getting too old for this job.

I take out my notebook and write down what I just learned. Or, in this case, what I might have got wrong. ‘Hope season is in. Need to buy antihistamines, antiallergens, milk, eggs, vanilla and more cigarettes’.

“No.” Says Natsuki and blows out a cloud of smoke that flies across the room and onto his face, making him cough severely and throw up in the hole Sayori left on the floor.

“I’m sorry to say this, young man...” I reach out to grab his shoulder, holding him steady for the bad news. It’s always me who has to give the bad news... ~~“But Elon Musk still owns Twitter.”~~

~~“Oh, no.” Says the man, face full of dread. “That’s the worst news I could get. A-And I paid for Twitter Blue!”~~

**This joke was redacted in advance in case Elon Musk dies or stops being the owner of Twitter.**

“Don’t worry, kid.” I reach out to grab his shoulder, holding him steady to reassure him. “We will find your sister.”

“Oh, thank you!” He wipes the dread leftover from the last joke off his face and smiles. “I knew I could count in you!” This man, so defensive of his sister, looks prepared to fight for her at the drop of a hat. He is an honest man, and worst of all, a good man. The kind of man that would avoid getting into a bar fight. I reach out to grab his shoulder and smash a bottle of beer on his face, just so that he knows how a bar fight feels like.

“But we can’t promise you anything.” Sayori says as she enters my office. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious. “Even if we do find her, we might not find her on the best of states.”

“What do you mean?” Asks the man. Sayori sighs and lights up a cigarette, taking a deep smoke from it and blowing it onto Yuri’s face, making her cough severely and throw up in the hole Sayori left on the floor.

“What she means is that we might find her wounded, beaten up, maybe even dead...” Natsuki says, lighting up the end of a bong and taking a deep breath in of it. “And even if we do find her completely safe and sound, we might beat her up just for the fun of it.”

“I-I understand.” Says the man, sighing afterwards, as he takes a crack pipe from his pocket and lights it up. “God, why must my sister be so fucking messy! She promised she wouldn’t go missing again!”

“Wait.” I say, throwing my cigarette on the ground and stepping on it. Unfortunately, I threw it in the hole Sayori left on the floor and I fell down through it.

“What Monika meant to say is that...” Yuri stands on the position I was and grabs the man’s shoulder. “This isn’t the first time she went missing?”

“N-No.” Says the man, sighing out a cloud of smoke as the memories fill up his mind. “Last time she went missing, she came back with seventeen severed hands and a lot of socks without pairs.”

“And you didn’t question her?” I ask as I enter my office. No knocking? Huh. Must be serious.

“No, because one time I came back home after two months of being outside while I cut off seventeen feet and grabbed a lot of gloves without pairs.”

That sounds awfully similar to a case up north. The Glove Puppet massacre of three years ago... Interesting. I light up a cigarette and write on it what I just learned. ‘This building is seventeen stories tall. Coincidence with the Sock Puppet massacre?’

“Here,” Natsuki says and offers MC a blunt, wider in circumference than her arm is. “You look like you need to calm down.”

“Thanks.” Says MC as he puts the short end of the blunt on his lips. Natsuki steps back and lights up a flamethrower, shooting it directly on the blunt’s surface to light it up. But thanks to how much she had to step back, she falls into the hole Sayori left on the floor while still shooting the flamethrower.

The flames spread quickly through the building, enveloping us all in its warm embrace. The cold rain outside tries its best to cool us, to seep its cold into our muscles and bones. But the fire that swallows us warms us up from the outside in. I think of my ex-wife for a moment, remembering her soft embrace in that wonderful honeymoon we spent in Hawaii. Two weeks away from the world, two weeks lost in each other, two weeks unaware of the violence of these streets, unaware of her strange collection of severed hands, unaware of the darkness that takes the soul of every man and woman that walks under the cold rain.

Some context; I work at a wonderful independent, speciality coffee shop in southern England. Everything is roasted in-house, with beans sourced directly from growers and lots of focus put on tasting notes, processing etc. We also do a pretty phenomenal food offering, serving simple but incredibly flavourful veggie/vegan dishes made with organic locally grown/sourced produce.

I, (ftm, 20, sw 186, cw 156, gw 140) like many of us, struggle to go to the bathroom consistently on a deficit. It's to the point where I was uncomfortable and my morning weigh ins sometimes felt pointless because the weight was so dependent on what I'd eaten the following day/night. I don't like to eat properly until after I weigh myself, so traditionally laxative foods didn't help either. 

My new foolproof and effective strategy is this: approximately 15 minutes before I plan to weigh myself, I drink half a cup to a cup of black coffee. I know it's well known that coffee has this effect, but as a previous non coffee drinker: oh my god I didn't expect it to help so much. AND it has basically 0 calories. I genuinely feel so much more comfortable afterwards instead having to carry that feeling of not being able to use the restroom for several more hours.

I (F) go to my dads every other weekend. My brother (4 years older) always had a bed but i didnt. I would sleep on bean bags or the couch or the floor. (With the rats and roaches) or he would make me sleep with him in his bed. Nothing weird happened to my knowledge. Dad would sleep in til 3 or 4 pm and i would eat rice cakes or dry raisin bran until he woke up. He had chewy bars if i was lucky. Once when i was 12 i had my friend over and he made us sleep in bed with him. When i woke up in the morning she was gone and had gone home cause she was sick.. the older i get the more fucked up i realize that is. If i were her parents i would have beat his ass at the very least.
My dad was always playing PS2 with my brother and he would tell me to stay outside and swim in the pool by myself (i was 8-11 years old, in a pool alone???) He had multiple injuries and developed an opioid addiction which i didnt catch onto until i started college and moved in with him to be close to campus. He finally bought me a mattress (as a ""christmas/birthday present"") cause at 19 years old i couldnt sleep on 2 bean bags pushed together anymore. Finally moved out at 21 cause the pill addiction got bad and he got really mean and scary and one time he also took Zzz-quill and stumbled into my bed and started MOANING his girlfriends name... yeah that was the last straw. I dont see or hear from him much anymore. When i do he just talks on the phone for 4 hours then asks me""are you mad at me?""

My mom is a whole other story. Honestly i think her brain is stuck as a 15 year old. To make it short she is a hoarder, alcoholic, constantly drinking and driving and thinks beer in a coffee mug is fooling everyone. She would drink while driving my brother and i around out of state our whole childhood.  We all lived in my grandparents basement.  My brother told our grandparents how he was afraid to get in a car with her because she was drinking and driving,  but they just told my brother to stop lying.  They enabled the drinking,  the hoarding,  the lying. My mom never had money yet didnt pay rent, utilities, didnt even buy her own ass wipe. Basically didnt even buy food, it was all my grandparents. Yet somehow i was never taken to the doctors or dentist. If i had bronchitis or an ear infection, i had to beg for DAYS for my mom to take me to urgent care. She would deny my pain and tell me im fine. I had tooth pain and she didnt care.  I told her i was suicidal she told me to stop trying to ""get drugs"" however my brother said he was suicidal and her world stopped spinning. My adult teeth keep breaking cause she never taught me to brush teeth and never took me to the dentist. At my grandparents my brother also had a bedroom. My ""room"" was a seethrough cloth hung up in a corner next to the bathroom barely enough room for a twin mattress. I didn't even have a dresser for my clothes. My mom says ""bathroom exhaust fans ""scare"" her"" so it would always stink to high heavens or i would wake up hearing her puke from alcohol poisining. 
My dad was kind of scary and i hated going to his house. My mom would make it worse by telling 6 year old me how terrible and mean my dad was to her and how he used to beat her up and she would have to hide when he got home so he wouldnt beat her up. Then MAKE me spend the weekend there (i was 6). Then when i came back home after spending the weekend at my dads, if i tried to talk to her about anything that happened she would scream at me ""i dont want to hear ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED THERE""
I grew up terrified most of my life and they didnt care so i really dont feel bad if my parents miss me or if theyre lonely cause ive felt pretty alone most my life. I guess thats all i can remember right now. Just thought of another thing, my dad would ask me what i thought family members penises looked like...hairy? Veiny? Fat? Long? (I was like 5 or 6?)

However, I got a UTI in May that I’ve not been able to shake. I’ve been on five rounds of antibiotics for it. Sometimes it would feel like it would go but as soon as I have sex, even if I pee right away, it came back. Or if I drank a lot of wine or coffee it triggered the symptoms again.

About two months ago, I posted a really extensive post [My first post here explaining everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/B12_Deficiency/comments/1fm8nlt/almost_b12_deficient_specialist_in_hospital/), where I explained all my lab results and most of my symptoms.

I want to keep everyone updated as I see myself as an experiment/case study of sorts. Please note that I have a strong tendency to be very disciplined in order to gain insights into the root cause of my issues. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the smartest approach (starting treatment immediately is probably the wiser choice). Furthermore, i tend to write rather lightly about my symptoms.

As I mentioned in my previous post, the specialists at the hospital don’t believe there’s any issue with my B12 levels. My B9 (folate) levels, however, were deficient, so I was prescribed folic acid (I know methylfolate would have been better, but let’s say I’m trying to be a cooperative patient).

My B9 levels have since increased from 5.7 nmol/L two months ago to 35 nmol/L (Reference: 10.4–42.4) as of a week ago, and my homocysteine has dropped from 34.9 to 10.0 µmol/L (Reference: 5.0–15.0)—yay! However, my serum B12 levels have decreased from 270 to 210 pmol/L (Reference: 145–569).

When I confronted my doctor about my borderline/low serum B12, she said it’s a completely normal level for someone my age (I’m 39). This really shocked me and, more than anything, deepened my disappointment in Dutch healthcare.

As injections are not accessible over the counter, i made up this small experiment for myself and this might be somewhat weirdly interesting for you guys to follow. Before i explain my experiment in more detail, i will describe my status in relation to B12 absorption (as kind of a checklist one could say).

**The last couple of years i was extensively tested for several things that we would assume to be absorption related** (absorption of B12 i mean). I:

* Had a gastroscopy last year (they took samples from my small intestines and looked at the wall of my stomach), confirming i don't have celiac disease and there's no gastritis going on or other conditions to the stomach wall (probably no Crohns as well then).

* I was tested for a range of autoimmune conditions like Lupus/Reuma/MS, they all came back negative (this included a MRI scan).

* I had genetic testing done at sequencing.com, basically i have a slow MTRR and according to Strategene a slow MTHFR but i only have a heterogeneous MTHFR C677T according to Genetic Genie (read, it's suboptimal but not the worst of the worst).

* Basically the only thing they didn't test if it comes to absorption is the intrinsic factor test (and partial cell but i'm not sure if they ever would since the gastroscopy was fine).

* Via several functional doctors i had tests done for my microbiome and i had a slight form of dysbiosis (and typical bacteria ratio's they would see with people with ADHD). After half a year of gluten free/lactose free/sugar free i didn't have leaky gut at least. I didn't have H-pylori, Candida or parasites (yep i really did all the tests).

* Didn't have any bypass or anything related to that (i have always been slim)

**Also absorption related might be my lifestyle but there doesn't seem to be anything weird tough:**

* I eat lots of meat/fish/eggs/cheese basically a normal Western-European diet but healthier then most (almost no sugar).

* I quit drinking alcohol 8 years ago since even after one drink i would be KO the day after.

* I quit drinking coffee as i would get a wild rebound at the end of the day and it triggered insomnia somehow

* I do cardio sports 3 times a week (intermediate as i can't handle more) and have really healthy stats in terms of heart/weight etc. 
* The only special that comes to mind is that i take ritalin for my ADHD but that shouldn't interfere with B12 absorption.

**So what are the next steps/the experiment you're going to do?**

Well, i'm going to do 2 things:

*Action 1 - Take a intrinsic factor test*

It looks like i can rule out most causes of absorption issues. That's why it might be useful to test for intrinsic factor to rule out pernicious anemia. I will do this somewhere later this month.

*Action 2 - Start supplementing with sublinguals and follow a strict diet*

I know a lot of you only healed with injections (and this is the golden standard!). It is more that the doc is not going to give them to me (yeah, eventually if i let it go for even longer...). Furthermore, i want to know for sure if i can't ""fix"" it with sublinguals. If it works, it would obviously be the greatest thing ever to me. I will give this experiment 6 months as there will most likely be wake-up symptoms and i will feel good/terrible during this time (read: i have to be patient to a certain extend).

Also, i will follow a gluten-free/lactose free/sugar free diet from January on. I believe that gluten is the hardest thing to process for you small intestines (might even cause leaky gut as functional docs would say). I also think that if one is low on B12, the body doesn't have enough energy/new cells to fix that leaky gut or weakened wall. This might in return create a vicious circle because of the leaky gut/weakened wall you're absorption of B12 will be even worse. Therefore, i will follow this diet while supplementing.

The stack i plan to use (i will increase dosage over time for the B12/folate to a maximum of 5mg a day):

* Elektrolytes via potassium powder/food, himalyan pink salt and magnesium (citrate + theonate), i don't tolerate glycinate (anything with glycine basically).
* Seeking Health Methyl 5000mcg and 1000mcg combined with methylfolate 1mg tablets.
* Seeking Health Trace minerals complex
* Seeking Health B Complex Plus

I will keep everybody updated!

1h0in94,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1h0in94/kind_strangers/,Kind strangers,"My dog has several types of reactivity but we have worked on them and he's gotten a lot better and tbh his main one is dog reactivity. When we first got him the outside world was just too much for him but in the nearly 7 months I've had him he's like a different dog and his confidence has grown so much.

Every morning we do a coffee shop pit stop in the middle of our walk. This is something I could never have dreamed of doing in the first few months I had him but he's now muzzled and we have been training and he now handles it like a champ and gets super excited because he wants a pup cup lol (hes really good at staying sat but as soon as he hears te sound of whipped cream he stands up and excitedly tries to go to the counter lol). We always go in the morning when it's more quiet and honestly 95% of the time we go in there's next to no one there and we just have a nice chat with the ladies that work there then continue our walk.

Today I turn up and there is a huge family in there trying to order and a few other people too. My dogs usually fine with people so I went in and waited with a little distance so people could walk past us. He knows as soon as hes in there that he has to sit and then he likes to people watch but will always check back in with me and get a treat. Once we came in a lot of them were staring at my dog which happens all the time because he's muzzled. Normally it's a mix of curious looks or judgment looks which is whatever not everyone is educated on muzzles. Either way I just focus on my dog and don't really think much of it. 

I then suddenly hear one of the girls saying how cute he is and the rest of the family agreeing and I look up and they are all smiling at my dog and quietly saying kind things about him and it just warmed my heart so much and they did it all while being really respectful of him and his space which i really appreciated 😭 I get it muzzles can be scary looking so when people look at him and still see how cute he is like I do it makes me so happy. People can think whatever they want i don't mind but it's really nice every now and then when I see people looking at my dog and not assuming he's aggressive. Especially when he is being a good boy. The same girl then turned to her mum and went ""i wish our dog was as well behaved as that"" and that just made me laugh because my dog can be a struggle especially with other dogs but the coffee shop is the one place he looks like a trained angel 🤣 it was nice to hear though and to have someone else notice his training.

After that a man then walked in and looked at my dog and smiled at him and gave him a little wave before walking away and i was just stood there like wow I've never been surrounded by so many people i dont knoe being kind to my dog lol. It was just a really nice experience. The ladies who work there are always really nice to him as well it's why I always come to them over any of the other coffee shops.

To top this off he did his first lay in public and he did it straight after I asked! (I'm not sure why maybe i was just doing something wrong but it's taken me the whole time I've had him to teach him to lay he just didn't understand what I was asking and then after he did learn it it took a while for him to understand to do it in public when i asked) he was getting harassed by flies though and he soon gave up laying down and decided he was going to pounce around trying to catch them which made everyone around him smile. It was nice having people see my dog just being silly and cute trying to pounce on flies instead of just seeing a dog in a muzzle and thinking he's scary. He's such a goofball and I love when others get to see that.

After all that we didn't have any dog reactions today we managed to redirect all of them which I'm so happy with especially since we have had a few reactive walks recently.

Today was a good day! I hope you all have had a good walk and if not then I really hope your next walk goes amazingly for you 💚",6,1732645074.0,reactivedogs,3,0.88,False

Here’s My Honest Review,"So, I’ve been looking for something to help me with focus and productivity lately, especially with work and side projects piling up. I came across **Lemme Focus Gummies** on Amazon and figured I’d give them a try. 

https://preview.redd.it/14ukuiwbfa3e1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=190685174fd5da4081e51865683a74fcb6ae9475

Here’s my experience after using them for a couple of weeks:

**Taste & Texture:** First off, these things taste great. They’re fruity with a slight herbal aftertaste, but nothing too strong or unpleasant. The texture is soft and chewy, which makes them easy to take. Honestly, they feel more like a treat than a supplement.

**Effectiveness:** I started taking two gummies every morning with my coffee. While it’s not a dramatic ""Wow, I’m a genius now"" feeling, I do notice that I can stay on task longer and my brain feels less foggy. It’s like a subtle mental clarity boost that builds over time rather than a quick jolt of energy.I’ve used them for workdays and even during gaming sessions, and they help me lock in without feeling jittery like caffeine sometimes makes me feel.

**What I Liked:**

* **Convenience:** No pills or powders—just pop two gummies and you’re good to go.
* **Ingredients:** It’s got Cognizin Citicoline, which I’ve read is good for focus and brain health.
* **Taste:** Legitimately enjoyable, which makes it easy to stick to.
* **Subtle Focus Boost:** Helps me stay productive without feeling overstimulated.

**What Could Be Better:**

* **Price:** At $30 a bottle, it’s not the cheapest option for a daily supplement.
* **Mild Effects:** If you’re expecting a dramatic difference in focus, this might not deliver that—it’s more of a subtle improvement.

**Final Thoughts:** I think the **Lemme Focus Gummies** are great if you’re looking for a tasty, easy way to add a little mental boost to your day. They’re not a replacement for coffee or hardcore focus supplements, but they complement my routine nicely.Has anyone else tried these? 

Curious if you’ve seen bigger benefits with longer use or if there’s a better gummy supplement out there. Let’s hear it! 🍬🧠",1,1732645063.0,SupplementReviewTime,0,1.0,False

My initial intention was to build a wildlife garden strip with a mix of native shrubs that stay 15’ or under to increase the privacy even further, interspersed with smaller shrubs and perennials.  But we have not only buried power lines on the property line (my fence is a few inches on my side of the line), but an overhead line running directly over the buried line as well.
