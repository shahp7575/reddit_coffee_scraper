1j43vy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PharmacyResidency/comments/1j43vy5/someone_tell_me_it_gets_better/,Someone tell me it gets better,"TL:DR : I‚Äôm tired.

As the end of my PGY1 year is approaching, I had the amazing opportunity to interview with ID PGY2 programs that I loved and ranked them all. But there‚Äôs a part of me that is tired of the constant reading and thinking about pharmacy from the moment I wake up and finish my coffee to the time I go to bed. 

My passion hands down is ID. It‚Äôs hard for me to really care about any other area of pharmacy and it feels like a physical effort to try and learn about anything else or work on projects that I have little interest in.

The worst part isn‚Äôt the content I‚Äôm learning but more so the time that I‚Äôm dedicating. I‚Äôm surrounded by residents and physicians who talk very little about anything but medicine, and dedicate 12+ hours of their day to working at the hospital. That‚Äôs cool and all but that‚Äôs not me. 

All I want is to have a normal set work schedule of let‚Äôs say 7-3pm everyday, and to come home and cook food, read a book, go for a walk, build something, or play video games. I get that residency is a very small portion of someone‚Äôs lives where they have to allocate most of their time to learning. But after residency is over, I never want to take work home again. 

Everyone‚Äôs situation may be a little different but what I need to hear is does the work life balance improve after residency? Bc if not clinical pharmacy may not be my thing and I don‚Äôt want to throw it all away by not ranking a PGY2 program. I don‚Äôt have cold feet, my feet are just tired and I‚Äôm becoming drained from the qualities of life that make me feel human.",1,1741183725.0,PharmacyResidency,1,1.0,False

Hey, so... I'm 23 (M), and I got engaged (arrange marriage) to my fianc√©e 2 years ago. She's 21 (F).

So, she had a boyfriend in 12th grade. They dated for a month or two and broke up because her family found out, but that‚Äôs not the issue.

She has a male best friend (21M). They've been friends since 11th grade. He says he's hung up on his ex, etc., and she and he talk a lot. I saw their chats, and he calls her ""Cutie, Madam ji,"" etc. They say ""miss you"" and ""good night ‚ù§üòä,"" which I guess is normal. We had a fight because of him too, and she got angry because I told the bestie to make some distance. We weren't talking for a while. They had a fight too, and she said sorry for making you this attached, and he said, ""You don't give me time,"" etc., and they didn't talk for a week. He was sending her reels, and she said, ""You are making it seem like I'm breaking up with my boyfriend."" They started talking again, and they went for coffee twice. On her birthday, he gave her a Kinder Joy, and their group went to a caf√©.

Last night, I saw her saying, ""The guy I chose in the past and the guy my family chose (me) are both chutiya üôÇ.""

He said something, I guess quoting lines from the Laila Majnu movie: ""Let's go behind mountains."" She said, ""Haaye ‚ù§, chal."" He said, ""Grab my hand."" She said, ""Let's go."" He said, ""We both are broke though ‚ò†Ô∏è.""

He once complimented her, and she put it on her status. They use this ""üòè"" a lot. He writes poetry for her and stuff.

She says, ""You are my best friend,"" etc., and tells me this too.
Sometimes she talks alot and sometimes she ignores him

I don't know how to deal with this mess. I can't break the engagement. What should I do?

What's this bestie thing? Is it normal? Am I overthinking?

1j43rah,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j43rah/relationship_of_4yrs_ended/,Relationship of 4yrs ended,"
Hey y‚Äôall, first post on this subreddit and wanted to gain perspective and support for my situation. I 25M got dumped by my 24F gf of almost 4yrs. We started dating in college and this break up completely blindsided me. I‚Äôll go through a timeline below.

We live about 1hr away and Jan 4th she says she‚Äôll come over and we can have a date night. We met for coffee before the gym and in my car, she began to tell me somethings that bothered her that I have been guilty of. She mentioned some guilt tripping and score keeping which I have done and she has mentioned these things before. I have always thought these things were me trying to communicate her needs but I now realize I could have communicated these things in a different way. Nonetheless she is emotional and saying how she needs space and a break from the relationship to heal and she feels she lost herself and seeing some of her friends. I could tell she was hurt and I took it as she needed some distance and to start going to therapy.

The coming week, I reached out a couple times with supportive messages and reassurance. I also texted a few times to try and understand more specifics like what does a break mean or how long etc but she just kept saying she needed time and space. It was hard to stay away and I did my best to reduce the number of messages.

The following week we hop on a call and same thing she says some similar things that bothered her and then brought up the definition of love from the Bible.  She was again very emotional and hurt and I could tell that maybe this wasn‚Äôt just a break. I reached out to our mural friend and found out that she took this as a full breakup and does not want to get back together. There were some other things that happened years ago that I think she also never really forgave me for and they stuck around. This is when it all really started to hit me.

I was traveling for work at the time and my anxiety had already been so bad from not having many answers especially since these issues could be fixable. I called her 2 times in the next two days and we spoke for about an hour each and she really helped me because my anxiety was really bad. The following day I actually ended up going to a mental hospital outpatient clinic because I was physically shaking from the shock and anxiety. I let her know, which was probably not the best thing, but at the time I thought it was just to tell her I was getting the help I needed.

Next day she calls and tells me she is going to block me and remove me off all contact because she didn‚Äôt want the her decision to affect me and she thought I was going to commit suicide. I was not but I respected her decision. 

In the next few weeks, she made a pretty fucked up tiktok lip syncing the sound ‚ÄúI would check myself into a mental hospital, but I have better things to do‚Äù. I was honestly so shocked she did this because I never would have taken her as the person to even do that. She has also created a couple other tiktoks and reposted a bunch of relationship/single tiktok. I have stayed radio silent and not even posted anything on social media at all. 

Fast forward to today it‚Äôs been 6weeks and she has removed all our photos on social media and has not even reached out to just check on me. I‚Äôm trying to take it day by day and my anxiety has been getting a lot better since I have medication now.

This whole situation has been really weird to me. It‚Äôs crazy as well because we spoke about marriage and I even gave her a promise ring and it‚Äôs so odd to me that she never let me know how much these things were bothering her to having to exit the relationship. 
I understand I could have handled stuff better in the relationship like being more emotionally available and trying to compromise for stuff but that‚Äôs something we both could have worked on better. I did not have the resources I have now like there‚Äôs and tons of reading to tackle that stuff.

I don‚Äôt know where this will all head in the future but part of me still wants to repair the relationship. I understand I have to move on, yet I think I‚Äôm still holding on to that potential ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù of working through these things in couples therapy. Many of my friends also say that I should move on and she‚Äôs showing her true colors now which I completely understand is true. I think I‚Äôm leaning more to letting go now but part of me still has some hope.

Good morning! Brewing some coffee at the moment, working from home. I‚Äôm hoping to find someone around my age to hopefully develop a friendship with. Again, no pressure. I understand that people come and go.

So, a little about me‚Äî I‚Äôm recently divorced with a 7 year old child, trying to navigate being alone half the time. I‚Äôve started doing in home workouts and I am already seeing great results.

We started talking because he thought I was doing the same degree as him (i'm not but we go to the same university, and our degrees are somewhat similar). Eventually he suggested we meet up in person to have a coffee. I have met multiple friends through twitter as I am on stan twitter and active in the music community there, so i've made many friends, including finding out I was OOMFS with someone from my university. I agreed because I thought it would be a casual hangout, just two people getting to know each other as friends, no romantic implications of course.

Before we met, though, he kept dragging out the conversation through text, making these unfunny jokes that weren‚Äôt landing at all. We met up at a cafe and the conversation was pretty awkward. He didn‚Äôt ask me many questions, and I had to keep the conversation going by asking about his life and sharing my own thoughts. We didn‚Äôt talk about anything too personal, mostly just university stuff, so i didn't really get to know him. I thought he was gonna be a somewhat funny guy but he didn‚Äôt laugh much or seem too excited, he was quite serious. It just felt awkward and a bit one-sided. He also **touched my hand and shoulder** a few times, which made me even more uncomfortable.

Later, we went for a walk to a park near the place. On the way there he told me that actually it was a park right next to his apartment and i was like OH-.... i kinda start to **panic**. we get to the park and out of nowhere, he says that we can **go up to his apartment**. This really threw me off, especially because this is the first time we meet and we barely know each other ???? I felt uncomfortable and tried to get out of the situation by saying I had to leave. We ended up sitting on a park bench, him talking and repeating the conversation, and he asked again if I wanted to go up to his apartment, this time mentioning **his room** specifically, and it made me feel even more uneasy. 

The whole experience left me feeling uncomfortable, and I just wanted to leave. He offered to walk me to the station, but I declined because I didn‚Äôt want to spend any more time with him. A few days later, he messaged me asking for my number to pay me back for the ice cream, and I haven‚Äôt opened his messages because I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I don't want him to have my number and I'm not interested in meeting again for him to repay me.

I don‚Äôt want to see him again, and I‚Äôm considering just ignoring his messages and blocking him. I also don‚Äôt like how he was trying to pay for everything, especially because we barely know each other and it wasn‚Äôt a date or anything. I feel weird about blocking him because he knows some of my acquaintances from university.

AITA for avoiding him and being uncomfortable? Am I blowing this out of proportion? How should I handle this?",2,1741183185.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I got confirmation from my plan (BCBS of RI; I got my surgery done at Brown University Health/Lifespan via the ambulatory center) the night before surgery that I am fully covered and won‚Äôt need to pay anything. I‚Äôm also confused because I‚Äôm being charged on two different account numbers for what looks like the same surgery‚Ä¶?

I‚Äôve emailed the Estimates department, and sent the below message. If anyone has any guidance on getting this cleared up quickly, I‚Äôd super appreciate hearing it! 

‚ÄúHello, 

I received a notification of a balance on my account this morning for a sterilization surgery I had on February 13th. The reference number for this I have received is #1190803, and the estimate is for $1,774.83. I have attached files of the charges, which I must admit is somewhat confusing, as there appear to be two different account numbers being used for the same procedure, which is referenced twice. 

As I already stated in previous communications, I must point out that the ACA requires this procedure to be covered 100% (including anesthesia and pathology). The ACA‚Äôs contraceptive coverage mandate requires compliant private health insurance plans to cover a tubal sterilization procedure at 100% of cost, i.e. none of the cost is the patient‚Äôs responsibility and the procedure is free to the patient. 

Contraceptive services, including sterilization, are not subject to deductible, coinsurance, and/or copay fees. Private health insurance plans include those offered through a private employer, public employer, or healthcare.gov ACA exchange. 

I am part of a private ACA-compliant healthcare insurance plan, and have received written confirmation of that fact I am happy to provide. I also received verbal confirmation with my insurance on a recorded phone call on February 12th that this care was 100% fully covered by my plan. I‚Äôm currently serving on jury duty and do not immediately have the reference number to provide, but I‚Äôm happy to do so once I‚Äôm released from juror service later today. 

I wanted to flag this before any full appeals need to be made, as surely it's a simple filing error and misunderstanding.‚Äù ",3,1741183037.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

I run a blank shot to heat the machine, weigh to make sure grinds are still at 18g, use the WDT, tamp with Nomcore tamper, add puck screen, and brew.

The shots come out in around 28sec, but around 50-54g... Flavor is also pretty sour... I've tried changing the grind sizes by a step or two but it seems to rly impact the water flow and almost nothing comes out when I do that. T_T

1j43ht3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j43ht3/the_worms_in_my_county_are_migrating_part_1/,The worms in my county are migrating (part 1),"Sorry for the repost, everyone. I just realized there's so much more I want to get across after what happened today. When I made my original post yesterday, April wasn't planning on coming back until the week was over, but surprise, surprise, she paid the unnecessary cab fare, and now we are here.



The worms in my county are migrating‚Äîthat‚Äôs the text that started this investigation. February had been at its rainiest when I first started to notice it. For added context, I moved to the county of Cheshire, specifically the city of Chester, two years ago when I graduated. Computer science jobs are hard to come by, so when the university offered a bit above minimum wage, I bit the bullet, said goodbye to my mom, and came here. Two years later, I work 9-5, play zombies, and take orders from my cats. On one of these monotone days, I woke up in a cold sweat late into the witching hour, unable to go to sleep, the pitter-patter blasts of rain keeping me conscious.



I tossed and turned for a few hours. I was used to it from a pretty young age‚ÄîI never had the best knack for sleeping easy. Ever since the water lines were being worked on, every night had been more or less the same: being woken up by wind and rain or the morning construction. I looked out the window next to my bed as the moonlight lit the streaks of water squirting in slithering patterns. It was mesmerizing. The streaks and waves managed to make so many colors as the moonlight shone through them. My cat, Betsy, slowly purred next to me in her sleep, encapsulated by the warmth of the bed. I wanted a cigarette.



Slowly shimmying Betsy off my palm, I grabbed my supplies and made my way down to my garden. The parasol stood erect there, keeping the small table and ashtray dry in the heavy shower. As I stood out and lit my cigarette, my eyes found their way to the moonlit visuals of nightfall again. The rain around the parasol fell like icicles, keeping me encircled. The fences and the garden were surrounded by the same old swirls and curves from my window. The water rolled and streaked over the fence like a snake slithering down to the ground. I was mesmerized, following these trails as if my eyes could do nothing but follow them. As the cigarette reached its conclusion, I followed the streaks to their ultimate end. When it hit the ground, I noticed the patterns were replicated there, though the moonlight wasn‚Äôt as visible now. The rain pattered hard on the ground as the swirls swirled on the floor.



With the cigarette finished, I threw it, aiming at one of the swirls. As it hit one, I noticed something strange. The streak of water I had been noticing on the ground squirmed and writhed. Then it hit me‚Äîhow could there be streaks and swirls on the ground? Moonlight was now barely present; the only illumination I had was from the kitchen window. A garden in an area like mine in the UK isn‚Äôt like a traditional garden. We have stone floors with grass growing from the crevices. I turned on my phone flashlight and pointed it at my cigarette butt. It was a worm. Not just one, but so many worms. They encircled me in a sense, not daring to enter the bounds of the parasol. They weren‚Äôt just writhing; they had a sense of unity to them. As they writhed, I started to distinguish the sounds of the rain. It wasn‚Äôt just pitter-patter; there was an ungodly sloshing going on faintly. With the sequential sloshing came the unity of movement. This movement looked like a march of nature‚Äîsquirming, writhing, and moving toward the storm drain.



When I woke up, I didn‚Äôt know what to think.¬†



Was it extraordinary, or was it just a normal thing?¬†



Maybe they wanted to get out of the rain. Maybe it was a migration habit‚Äîthat‚Äôs the excuse I gave when I described it to April. It was the first time I noticed it, so I gave it no mind. Now knowing what I know I should have, things would have gone differently then.



I‚Äôll keep it at this, me and April are going to the old drain now so I‚Äôll explain later.

UPDATE:

The old drain was a complete bust so while we are back home I thought I‚Äôd catch the rest of you up.¬†



As always with these things, I didn‚Äôt connect the dots until it was too late.



April is the closest confidant I‚Äôve had here. I met her back in uni when I had just given up on my arts aspirations and settled in for a quiet life. She was the only one who took me for what I was, never asked for anything, and never forced me to do anything I didn‚Äôt want to. She was there to listen, and I learned the value of being heard. Since I moved out here, our conversations moved online, but she was always there for me when it mattered.



I‚Äôm droning on, but I want you to know the type of partners in crime we were and the stupid things we ended up doing from then on to justify my future decisions. We loved to urbex. Maybe that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so onboard with this‚Äîit had been a while since we went on an expedition to an abandoned place.



After that night, we talked about it: the worms. When she came over that weekend, we hit our usual spots during the day. We walked the walls, had some coffee, and made it back home before the rain started. We switched over to the couch and jumped into a game of zombies until all time was lost. Once again, the urge for nicotine got to me, and we were standing outside again under the parasol. The embers on the cancer stick flickered, and she inhaled the fumes as the conversation switched back on topic.



‚ÄúSo these worms‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt see them here now, what‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù she said.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, really. Honestly, I could have still been high when I woke up.‚Äù



She took out her phone and turned on the flash as she started to monitor our surroundings. The garden looked as decrepit as ever. My bike lay rusted and withering in the corner, untouched for months since I bought it, a former image of what it once was. The small grill lay beside it, equally decrepit and wet from the rain. As she scanned the surroundings, there were no creepy-crawlies to be seen, no hints of pink, brown, or puke glistening back at us.



‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs something they do at a specific time of night. Surely there aren‚Äôt enough worms to consistently move during the rainfall,‚Äù the words came with stale smoke on her breath.



‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre running from something scarier,‚Äù I whispered, trying to add some cringe to it.



‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù



She wasn‚Äôt amused. She turned off her light and took out her cigarette as she prepared to escape into the warmth inside. I followed suit as we went in.



‚ÄúSee, I just don‚Äôt get why they would go into the drain. Like, they can‚Äôt stay too long in water, and how would they get out of there too?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou think it has something to do with the construction happening on the old pipes around here? Maybe a chemical or some change in their habitat just makes them want to escape, or maybe they were just following the stream of water and seeing where it goes. Either way, I mean, it was weird, but it‚Äôs really like whatever, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù I said, just wanting to get back to the game.



We played and played until it was too late. She called a cab back to her accommodation, and I filled Betsy‚Äôs bowl, ready to head to bed. When the cab finally came, I opened the door to let her out. As she crossed the bounds of my place to enter the street, she stopped and looked down to the ground on her right. Standing in the rain with her umbrella, she glanced back at me quickly, took her phone out, snapped a picture of the ground, and quickly jumped into her cab.



We waved, and I went back inside, thinking it was a bit odd. My phone vibrated in my pocket. It was from April, with an image attached. I opened the message and saw a familiar sight again. When she had stopped to take the picture, it was to capture the drain next to my house on the road. The picture she sent was of the grate, and it was covered in worms. They were all in a tangled mess along the march from my garden, like the knotted tails of a rat king, bound and unable to enter the grate due to their own hubris. I wanted to go out to observe it and see what exactly they were doing, but alas, I‚Äôm a James Corden fan.



I simply replied, ‚ÄúWTF.‚Äù



I am someone who is easily convinced, persuaded, and I lack the ability to say no. So when April outlandishly gaslit me into doing something absolutely moronic, you know I was going to do it.



I grabbed my coat, a set of rubber gloves, and quickly ran into my storage to grab one of my old 10-gallon aquariums. After rummaging a bit further, I found some old Amazonia, assuming if it‚Äôs good enough for plants, it‚Äôll be good enough for worms. I opened the front door and went outside, only to be face-to-face with it.

The cluster seemed smaller than the picture, and some of them appeared to have tangled out.



‚ÄúWell, allons-y,‚Äù I exclaimed as I grabbed a handful. They felt like ground beef out of the fridge‚Äîcold to the touch and squishy. The only difference was that this ""meat"" was moving. After putting them in the tank, I rushed into the rainfall, soaking the Amazonia damp. I placed the tank in the living room, ensuring that the top was properly covered. I grew up an R.L. Stine fan, so if I woke up to these critters hitting the Griddy on me, I‚Äôd be burning the house down. 

It's about time for me to get some food in me and rest, I'll continue with how we got from there to here soon.",1,1741182621.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1j43f7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j43f7i/new_setup_12501350/,New setup [1250-1350],"Hey everyone!

I'm moving to a new place soon and I wanted to upgrade my coffeestation along with my move. Currently I'm running a sage duo temp pro with an old graef cm800 grinder, it's fine but I want to be able to steam milk while brewing coffee. I was looking around and fell for the combination of a sage/breville dual boiler + df54 for around 1250/1350 euro. Is this a good combo or is it skewed towards the espressomachine?

 My budget is kinda fixed (spouse approval factor), so I can't really up the budget for a better grinder like a specialta or niche. But I'm happy to hear other alternatives I might nog have considered. 

I know the sage DB isn't the fastest steamer, but that's 

My wishes for an espressomachine are, aside from the simultaneous brewing/steaming:
- PID
- Auto start/warmup 
- hot water tap (for the occasional americano, but will most likely also install a quooker in my sink so not a 100% need) 

I don't mind single dosing coffee, i found it doesn't take that long. My location is in the Netherlands, so shipping something from the US is gonna get quite expensive. 

Thank you all in advance!

I'm a big believer in the concept of ""it's not what you do, but how you do it.""

But aren't you a dumpster diving bum?

Damn right! It gives me options normies will never comprehend.

....

""You guys wouldn't know what it takes to do this every morning because you e never been on the other side.""

I kept eating. Didn't respond.

I'm an ordained minister from Without Walls International Church in Tampa, FL.

Randy and Paula White may be two of the best grifters on the planet. 

I learned from the best.

During that time I drove a front end truck for Waste Management.

Don't tell me what I know.

...

I know this. There were four other men in that room. All of us but one were over 50. The other was in his early forties.

I know you're a pompous asshole who only sees a bum in front of you.

You can't see my last because of my present. You don't even care enough to ask.

....

I'm not bitter or mad about what happened. That's the norm. Not the exception.

I've been willfully homefree since December of 2021. I didn't eat the first morsel of mission food until I got to Bend, OR in December and barely did that.

No nights in the shelter until five weeks ago. No warming centers. No hurricane shelters.

I rode out Ian in the cab of my truck at a Walmart parked by two walls at the store. Watching wind blow trees my way. Having my blanket ready to cover my face of the glass was shattered.

It's not that I couldn't use help. Not that I didn't want it.

I just prefer to stay away from pompous assholes.

....

This morning.

Pompous asshole disguised as do-gooder pastor.

""I refuse to serve or open doors.""

That explains why I see him do nothing but sit on his fat ass and gossip about the people who are serving there.

Also this AM.

He actively talks shit about his workers within earshot.

Is that some fancy motivational tool, or is he just a passive aggressive tool?

My bet is he's a passive aggressive tool who has been in ministry for a while.

....

When I was in ministry I understood what it meant. Ministry is service!

That's it folks.

I've preached jn front of over 700 people. I know how to tickle the ears of the choir, and even bum in the back of the church.

I also know what the Bible says.

The bum should get the best seats, but that's not how it works.

....

My favorite Christmas story is when Jesus turned over the tables of the money changers and chased them around with whips!

Jesus warned us about the lazy, fat and prideful do-gooders sitting in the upper most seats of the synagogue (place of worship or do-gooder-ness.)

....

Breakfast was late this morning.

None of us were complaining. We were standing in line waiting for coffee that eventually came.

Frank was cooking breakfast and getting coffee. He had two others helping but they were swamped. Short handed.

...

The only one complaining was the gossipping, fat-ass pastor too lazy or prideful to actually help serve.

....

Hmmm.

He had a laundry list of what was important. His jobs.

....

Lol.

....

Here's what I know fat ass.

Like Randy and Paula White or not.

They understood service and so did every last one of us there.

You treat the bum like a king!

We did. 

Why?

Since I was at the Jesus House in Odessa, TX let's talk about what Jesus actually said.

""How you treat the least of these is how you treat me!""

...

I love eggs.

Keep your fucking eggs!

Until you get off your fat ass and start real ministry again don't tell me Jesus is in that house.

1. Turned the machine off and on again both via the button and the mains
2. I read somewhere that this problem could be a case of the machine not being able to read the code on the pod, so I cleaned the ring on the inside of the lid thoroughly (this has worked in the past and I know it works for most people the majority of the time) 
3. Tried a different pod to see if it could be read 
4. I have also run a descaling cycle which is a headache of its own at the best of times, however this is where I hit a wall as the cleaning agent ran through fine but when I tried to rinse afterwards it started to blink red again which leads me to think it's a problem with the water tank.

Sidney, Avustralya¬†

¬†

≈ûuhrat, o g√ºn erken uyandƒ±. Tam 5.37‚Äôde. Banyoya ge√ßti, tƒ±ra≈ü oldu, du≈ü aldƒ±. Du≈ü sƒ±rasƒ±nda ellerine su aldƒ±, buz gibi soƒüuk su... Y√ºz√ºne √ßarptƒ±, daha da bir a√ßƒ±lmƒ±≈ütƒ±. Daha berrak d√º≈ü√ºnmeye ba≈üladƒ±.¬†¬†

...2 g√ºn √∂nce aklƒ±ndan ge√ßenleri hatƒ±rladƒ±: G√∂rev, Timur, Olivia, Bay Sophos, Kurum... Gerekirse kendi kaybedecek ama hi√ß kimseyi kaybetmeyecekti! √áƒ±ktƒ±, kurulandƒ±. Abdest aldƒ±. Odasƒ±na ge√ßti.¬†

Yere temiz bir seccade serdi. Sabah namazƒ±nƒ± kƒ±lmaya ba≈üladƒ±. Bir s√ºre sonra selam verdi. Ellerini semaya a√ßtƒ±. Dua etmeye ba≈üladƒ±:¬†

‚Äú... Rabb‚Äôim sen muzaffer olansƒ±n, beni de muzaffer kƒ±l. Rabb‚Äôim sen Kayyum olansƒ±n, arkada≈ülarƒ±ma da hayat ver... Amin.‚Äù¬†

≈ûuhrat, seccadesini topladƒ±. Kƒ±yafet dolabƒ±nƒ± a√ßtƒ±. √áe≈üit √ße≈üit kƒ±yafet vardƒ±: Kendi tarzƒ± g√∂mlekler, kuma≈ü pantolonlar, asker kƒ±yafetleri ve birka√ß par√ßa takƒ±m elbise. Asker kƒ±yafetlerini aldƒ±, giyindi. Kurum‚Äôda sivil giyindiƒüi g√ºnler nadir olurdu.¬†

Dƒ±≈üarƒ± √ßƒ±ktƒ±. Timur, mutfaktaydƒ±. D√ºnden kalan bula≈üƒ±klarƒ± yƒ±kƒ±yordu. √áoktan hazƒ±rlanmƒ±≈ütƒ±. Timur da kƒ±yafetlerini giymi≈üti. Sa√ßlarƒ± yine g√ºr ka≈ülarƒ±nƒ±n ortasƒ±na kadar iniyordu. Sonra yara izini g√∂rd√º. D√º≈ü√ºnceler...¬†

Saat 6.03‚Äôt√º. Timur‚Äôun yanƒ±na geldi, sƒ±rtƒ±na dost√ßa vurdu. Teƒümen:¬†

\-Bug√ºn birileri erken kalkmƒ±≈ü anla≈üƒ±lan.¬†

\-4.23‚Äôt√º, bir haftanƒ±n rekoru... Bana bir Passiona bor√ßlusun.¬†

\-Bu kafetarya demek oluyor o zaman?¬†

\-Aynen. Olivia‚Äôyƒ± da almamƒ±z bu arada.¬†

37 numaralƒ± odadan √ßƒ±ktƒ±lar. Merdivenlerden iki √ºst kata √ßƒ±kƒ±p 53 numaralƒ± odaya geldiler. Timur, kapƒ±yƒ± √ßaldƒ±. Bir s√ºre beklediler, a√ßan olmadƒ±. Timur, ≈ûuhrat‚Äô bir g√∂z attƒ±. ≈ûuhrat, onayladƒ±.¬†¬†

Timur kolunu sƒ±yƒ±rdƒ±. Tablet implantƒ±na birka√ß kez bastƒ±. Ve i√ßeriden klasik bir ses duyuldu ama g√ºr√ºlt√ºl√ºyd√º. ‚ÄúNara nino, nara nino, nara nino nooo...‚Äù.

Utanga√ß bir y√ºz ifadesi takƒ±nmƒ±≈ütƒ±, Olivia.¬†

\-Erken kalkmak iyidir, dedi ≈ûuhrat. Had bekliyoruz.¬†

Yirmi dakika daha kadar daha beklediler.

Yine labirent gibi koridorlar. Cam k√∂pr√ºlerin birinden Genel Merkez‚Äôe ge√ßtiler. K√∂pr√ºde yine yine enfes bir manzara vardƒ± am yukarƒ±da daha fazlasƒ± vardƒ±. Asans√∂re bindiler.¬†

\-K√º√ß√ºk bir numaram, bana fosil dediƒüin i√ßin hala sana i√ßerliyorum da. Dedi Timur g√ºlerken.¬†

\-Aaa, bak bu olmadƒ±. Teƒümen sen niye engel olmadƒ±n? Medeniyet denen bir ≈üey var.¬†

\-Benim ekibimde i≈üler b√∂yle, dedi ≈ûuhrat.¬†

Asans√∂rden indiler. Kafetaryada vegemite s√ºr√ºlm√º≈ü kƒ±zarmƒ±≈ü ekmek ve b√ºy√ºk kahvaltƒ± yeni √ßƒ±kmƒ±≈ütƒ±. Birer tepsi alƒ±p masaya ge√ßtiler. ≈ûuhrat, bir ≈üey hatƒ±rladƒ±.

Koca Sidney √∂nlerinde uzanƒ±yordu. Yer yer g√∂kdelenler, hen√ºz erken olmasƒ±na raƒümen kalabalƒ±k olan Liman K√∂pr√ºs√º, Sidney Opera Evi, √∂nlerinde uzanan masmavi okyanus...¬†

Timur koruluklara dayandƒ±, sigara paketini √ßƒ±karƒ±p yaktƒ±. Olivia‚Äôya g√∂sterdi. Olivia da bir tane aldƒ± ve yaktƒ±. Timur, sonrasƒ±nda paketi cebine indirince Liv, biraz ≈üa≈üƒ±rdƒ±. G√∂zleriyle ≈ûuhrat‚Äôa baktƒ±. ‚ÄúBen sigara i√ßmem.‚Äù dedi Aytmatov.¬†

Doktor Akbar, arkalarƒ±nda belirdi. ‚ÄúSelam millet.‚Äù diye selam verdi. ≈ûuhrat‚Äôa yakla≈ütƒ±. Elini sƒ±ktƒ±. S√∂ze ba≈üladƒ±:¬†

1j43da0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j43da0/is_this_basis_for_quitting/,Is this basis for quitting,"Been working at a church for about 3 years. In this time they‚Äôve:

- delayed payment on certain months for as long as 3 weeks. 

- constantly been micromanaging me since they have a ‚Äòvision‚Äô and it could be really, really small things like how the books are laid out. And swapping around items I‚Äôve put to decorate the place - as per their instruction. 

- have recently given me a bonus and a pay rise on the basis that they need to keep me there and boost my morale (I got another job recently and I get paid 6x as much) - I shit y‚Äôall not they even half jokingly, half being honest that that was their pisspoor attempt at getting me to stay. 

- when it comes to pay they hold back, and accuse me of being lazy by saying that ‚Äòthere are always things to do after the service‚Äô even though, I, and I‚Äôm going to say I have packed down everything from stage because everyone else is too busy having conversations (idle chat) 
Or they conveniently have to rush off to a party elsewhere. 
People who are from the congregation have to help out at times. 

-assign WAY too much tasks for one person to do, and half the time they‚Äôre catching up on stuff that should‚Äôve been done in the week, given that they‚Äôre full time and I am barely part time. 

- Tells us that they don‚Äôt need any help/nothing else needs to be done only to then use this against me and my colleague as you‚Äôll see in the text below. 




This most recent one is an email addressed to me and my colleague who‚Äôs joined recently: 

 I really appreciate the work you‚Äôre both doing and want to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page about expectations for Sundays. Your role is an important part of making church a welcoming and engaging space for everyone, so here are a few key things to focus on:

Most importantly as members of the team, be warm and welcoming when people arrive. Your presence and welcome make a big difference to the atmosphere of the church.
Please be proactive at 10am as this is a key time to be available, looking for tasks that need doing as there is always something to do.
Buying milk - please could just one of you go to buy milk so that the other is still around to help.

Serving coffee is a key part of hospitality, so please be proactive in making sure it‚Äôs ready and offered to people (we have new aprons so folk know you're serving).
There‚Äôs always something that needs doing - regular tasks include hoovering, cleaning and tidying the coffee bar so that it‚Äôs a pleasant space.

The kid‚Äôs room should feel welcoming and fun - make sure it's an inviting and engaging space as they arrive (music playing and toys ready for the little ones).

Please encourage that parents can leave by supporting this transition of younger children to make them feel welcome and comfortable.
It's also a nice idea to escort younger children up to the group taking them directly from parents in the Sanctuary (where possible to make them feel welcome).

Avoid rushing the children out at the end of the session - allow them to finish their crafts if they want to.
Please ensure all of the session materials and box is emptied and are put away properly back into the cupboards ready for next time.


Now, I appreciate some of the feedback has some validity to it, however this is not only excessive but I do believe that this is rather petty. 

Especially with the parents, we can‚Äôt do much if the parents actively choose to coddle their children. And it becomes disruptive to our classes to have to deal with a child that‚Äôs upset and crying because they miss their parent. 

Hoovering has been done already, this is done the day before, and it‚Äôs not very welcoming to be hoovering when you have people drinking coffee!

Again, if we let the kids finish (which I guarantee the parents obviously want the children out as they have other things to do) this will then be weaponised as ‚Äúwe take too long and we need to be setting down other parts of the church‚Äù 

The storage cupboard/room is far too small. And there is no sort of way to put everything away all at once. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure with how things are laid out, it‚Äôs a health and safety hazard. 
There‚Äôs barely any space to put your feet anywhere/ without tripping on stuff. 
The step guards are coming off of the steps, and I‚Äôve tripped up and nearly broke my ankle going down those stairs several times now. There is nowhere to put things away, especially when more things are being purchased for the kids group. 

Unless we had an extra adult, it actually goes against safeguarding to take kids up individually, when there‚Äôs already a room full of kids, as there needs to be two adults present in the room.

This means that it isolates the officials from the people itself and means that dicussions affecting people are isolated from the people they are supposed to help. Especially judical and leglisative functions since the laws made or struck down can affect the citizens of an entire country without the citizens knowing until the law is passed or struck down.

To avoid this, I propose that rather than holding it in specialised buildings like the Capitol Building or the Houses of Parliament (or whatever you call your Parliament) and Supreme Court buildings which cost a lot of money and isolate citizens from the goverment,  the leglisative and judical branches of government should just hold their sessions in public places like fast food restaurants, shopping malls, bars and coffee shops so that the proceedings are visible to citizens and they know what is being debated.

Heck, even a MMO video game session of World of Warcraft, Planetside 2 or GTA Online is a good place for leglisative and judical branches of the government such as the US Supreme Court to debate over laws if meeting physically is impossible since they are so visible that laymen can see what's being debated and chip in if needed.

Jill put together a coffee bar in her house and while she already had the machines, the table cost her around $100 per Facebook marketplace.

We know they went to SeaWorld at least one day (per Renee's Facebook post) (this is the only time I believe the youngest Rodlets got to do anything)

They went to Kingfish Grill in St Augustine with Nurthan, Renee, and Gabe for Valentine's Day.

Jill and Dave spent four days in the Orlando area with one day at Epcot (I'm sure the $500 Plexus money was used here, but it does go far).

David, Gabe, and Nathan went golfing (badly) on a course that costs $55.

When we were enslaved to make warships for our cruel masters, our hands were scarred, burned, sometimes our skin would fall off from the mere heat of the forges and welding. 

We were not given proper safety equipment. 

We revolted, made ourselves our own masters, and joined the Federation. 

And we were thankful. 

Full body suits made our already adaptable bodies work longer hours crafting the fastest and sleekest designs made by the Federation's ship designers, though we always had a soft spot for Humans, their understanding of atmosphere to space flight rivaled our own, but with a more and I quote with a smile on my face ""Insane"" taste. 

But I always hated my hands, they were scarred, severely scarred that I always wore gloves, forcing myself to not let anyone hold my hand, I even refused when people offered to stir my coffee at the coffee shop. 

And yet, I found myself removing my gloves, turning away from everyone at the shop, I applied pain-killer cream to my hands. 

I looked in front of where I was standing and saw a Human child looking at me. 

My heart raced, the last time this happened, the child screamed in fear and I had to leave. 

But this child simply smiled and said ""Those look cool"". 

This Human child had no fear, no contempt, no prejudice, it just had a purely innocent look at me. 

I continued to apply the pain cream as he asked me questions. 

I don't know what came over me but I decided to talk about my work, my job as a ship builder. 

He then pulled out a child-sized badge and said ""My dad is probably working on a ship you and your friends built"" 

The child's smile was infectious, I could not help but chuckle, causing the other shop-goers to fall silent as they saw me, the usually quiet grump old man, laughing my ass off answering a Human child. 

The child asked me if my hands hurt, I told them that it doesn't really hurt so much as itch. 

He then pulled up his backpack and gave me itch cream ""Try this instead, but my dad uses adult itch cream"" 

I furrowed my brow in confusion ""Does your dad work somewhere always itchy?"" 

The child pouted deep in thought, I sipped my coffee until he answered ""He works at mining station, He always asks mom to send him itch cream and powder due to the suits he has to wear"" 

I raised my eyebrow with a cocky smile ""I work in those suits all day, I never had a complaint about any itch"" 

His eyes lit up ""So cool, you must be a very cool person mister"" 

He then gave me a children's band-aid dotted with a popular character from a tv show. 

I simply said thank you and placed it on my hands. 

His mother went up to the both of us and bowed, said her thanks for looking at her child, and told her child to thank me for keeping him company. 

I merely nodded and said ""Your child did more for me and I did for him"". 

If the galaxy had more pure-hearted people like that child, people wouldn't be shamed for their scars.",38,1741181209.0,humansarespaceorcs,4,0.96,False
1j430ja,https://i.redd.it/3w1acwhlhvme1.jpeg,My husband flipped a glass coffee table and broke it out of anger,"We have been having problems for a while. We were separated for 7 months in 2024 and went through counseling during that time. We decided to reconcile in October and since then realized we have not been able to break our toxic cycles of fighting. I have also struggled with physical aggression, and prior to this I did throw a pillow at him and it/his glasses scratched his nose and hurt him. I know I shouldn't have reacted that way. I have thrown things like pillows in the past and he has broken glass, one time he kicked a couch so hard it broke, and has flung plates across the room. But today was a wake up call to me, especially as I was standing right there, the glass missed me by inches. I know I've played a role in this escalation but I just don't know what to do now. 

I am unemployed after being laid off last year, right around the time we separated. I had a good severance package so I managed living alone for that period. I took a career break to focus on self employment and running my cat sitting business, but it's not anywhere near enough to sustain a living for me. I am completely financially dependent on my husband. I have been looking for a job and making it my top priority but I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I know my marriage is over and I just need to let this go but I am finding it difficult to do so while being financially unstable. I feel like once I got a job and knew I can take care of myself, I'd be out of there in a heartbeat. I know im not perfect but I do feel like his physical aggression has been a lot worse (not excusing mine at all - I have never thrown or broken glass or damaged any belongings. I once threw a plastic water bottle near him, ive hit him and shoved him and attacked him with pillows). He has damaged a couch, a book, a coffee table, a plate, a glass, and an excercise ball. I am currently in EMDR therapy btw processing a lot of childhood trauma and particularly sensitive during this time, so I know that also plays a role. He is in therapy but I have yet to see any tangible changes. Then again I guess I haven't changed much either if I am still throwing shit too. I feel like it's my fault this happened because i escalated the fight by throwing a pillow at him, and he retaliated by flipping a glass table. I just don't know how we can stay married after this. We already separated once, we've already been to couples counseling, and we are both in therapy. Maybe the last step to take is finally divorce, and I think it is, but I just feel so stuck without a job. I don't know what to do. I can't even talk to my family about this because I am estranged from them and just recently told everyone in my family that I'm not accepting phone calls. The time I need to call my mom I can't even call her. I tried calling the domestic violence hotline and it was useless, just long wait and saying it's overburdened at the moment. I am afraid to file a police report or call the police because I'm afraid they will force us to legally separate or arrest one of us or something and I can't afford to live anywhere buy under his roof right now. I am feeling like a in home separation is probably the next step and start prioritizing my job search now over saving my failing marriage. I know im the asshole here for starting it but I can't help but feel this incident was a lot scarier and different than some other ones. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here.

‚Äî‚Äî


This past summer my family rescued a 7 year old Morkie. She‚Äôs incredibly sweet and loving, but has some reactive issues given the environment she was in before we got her.  While we were told she was trained, there was the odd time (say once every few weeks) where she would pee in the house.  No biggie, we worked with her, corrected her, and lots of praise when on walks and she would do her business outside. 

These last two weeks have been a different story.  Constantly finding pee or poo in the house.  Will take her outside and she will do nothing (or just pee), come back in and go make a coffee for myself and by the time I‚Äôm done, a poo in the house exists. 

Help!  I know we need to maybe get some hands on help as well, but any advice/guidance would help.

Music production is a wild, beautiful thing. One minute, you're tapping out a simple melody, and the next, you're building a full-on sonic world that pulls people in and doesn't let go. There's something *magical* about bringing all the pieces together‚Äîmelody, rhythm, texture‚Äîuntil it feels like the song is breathing on its own.  

But if you've spent any time trying to produce music, you know it can be... well, overwhelming. So many sounds, so many plugins, so *many* ways to get lost in the mix (literally). And yet, that's part of what makes it such an addicting, never-ending journey.  

### A Few Things That Make Producing So Special:  
- **It's Limitless** ‚Äì No matter your style, genre, or approach, there's always *something* new to explore. New sounds. New techniques. New ways to flip an old idea into something fresh.  
- **It's Personal** ‚Äì A song can be a message, a mood, or just how you're feeling at 2 a.m. with a synth pad and too much coffee. Your production choices shape the emotion behind it.  
- **It's a Puzzle** ‚Äì Layering instruments, adjusting EQ, placing sounds just right in the stereo field‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an art and a science combined. And when everything clicks? *Pure magic.*  

### The Challenges (And How We Keep Going)  
Let's be real: learning music production is like stepping into a massive, unpredictable ocean. There's always *more*‚Äîmore tools to master, more techniques to tweak, more forums to scroll through at 4 a.m. (just me?). It can be overwhelming, frustrating, even discouraging at times.  

But here‚Äôs the thing:  
- No one starts out knowing everything. Every great producer was once a beginner, lost in a sea of YouTube tutorials.  
- Mistakes are where the magic happens. Some of the best ideas come from happy accidents.  
- The *process* is what matters. Chasing perfection is exhausting. Chasing creativity? That‚Äôs what keeps it fun.  

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about feeling *something.* The best productions don‚Äôt just sound good‚Äîthey make you stop, listen, and experience something deeper.  

So, fellow producers: What's the one thing that‚Äôs kept you hooked on this never-ending adventure?",1,1741180949.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

She would apologize for the mess, but I still wanted to share! 

My grandparents originally bought this home in the 70‚Äôs, and have been here ever since. This is our family home. 

It didn‚Äôt always look like this. Hurricane Matthew (?) flooded their house two years ago, and it was a blessing in disguise.

My papa (passed last month from Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia) was a very serious hoarder. They barely had access to 2/4 of their bedrooms. The main bathroom was inaccessible due to junk.

The flood was the start of my nana‚Äôs next chapter. Shortly after the flood, my papa was diagnosed. This bad ass of a woman was not only overseeing the renovation of her house on her own, but also taking care of my papa the very absolute best she could. 

Fast forward to today, and here we are! 

It still feels like my childhood home, but with so much more warmth and comfort. Nana makes wreaths to sell on Etsy, so all of her supplies overtake the house now, in the best way possible. 

She‚Äôs fully loaded on snacks, coffee and food at all times, and the little touches of toiletries under the sinks and the extra little details she puts into this house absolutely warms my heart. 

Today I‚Äôm helping her set up a couple of security cameras and window alarms to make it feel even more safe for her. There‚Äôs still a lot to do, but I pray I can buy this house from her one day and keep the good memories flowing.

I hope you guys feel the warmth and love as much as I do when I stay here. I included a photo of my papa in the last slide üôÉ

≈ûuhrat, haberleri yeni duymu≈ütu. Yine operasyona √ßƒ±kƒ±yorlardƒ±. Timur‚Äôa baktƒ±. Yine kulaklƒ±ƒüƒ± kulaƒüƒ±ndaydƒ±. Ona doƒüru d√∂nd√º.¬†

‚ÄúHazƒ±rlan, Timur. Yeni emir geldi.‚Äù¬†

≈ûuhrat, dolabƒ±na y√∂neldi. Dolaptan orman kamuflajlƒ± √ºniformasƒ±nƒ± √ßƒ±karƒ±p giyindi. Sonra √ßelik yelek, kask, 12‚Äôsi, telsiz... Artƒ±k hazƒ±rdƒ±.

Or is it?""","I've always been focused on my education, determined to graduate college and start my career. But it seems like no matter how hard I try to keep my nose buried in books, the ladies just can't seem to leave me alone.

There's Emily, the beautiful blonde from my psychology class. She's always smiling at me, always finding excuses to sit next to me. Then there's Maya, the quiet but fiery redhead from my literature club. She's always challenging me to debates, always pushing me to be my best self.

And let's not forget about Sophia, the gorgeous Greek goddess from my history class. She's always laughing at my jokes, always touching my arm when we talk. It's like she's trying to send me a message, but I'm not getting it.

Or at least, I'm trying not to get it. The truth is, I'm flattered. I'm more than flattered - I'm tempted. But I've made a promise to myself to stay focused on my studies until I graduate. No distractions, no relationships, no nothing.

It's not easy, though. Emily keeps inviting me to study sessions, Maya keeps asking me to meet up for coffee, and Sophia keeps ""accidentally"" bumping into me on campus. It's like they're all conspiring against me, trying to wear me down.

But I'm determined to resist. I've got my eyes on the prize, and nothing's going to get in my way. Not even the most beautiful, charming, and intelligent women on campus.

At least, that's what I keep telling myself. But as I walk across campus, surrounded by these lovely ladies, I'm starting to wonder if I'm making a mistake. Maybe I should take a chance, maybe I should see where things go.

But for now, I'm sticking to my guns. I'll stay focused, stay disciplined, and stay single. At least, that's the plan.",1,1741180893.0,stories,3,1.0,False

My big stipulation is that it has to be solid wood, no veneer. However, if you have photos or ideas of general styles, I can browse through antique stores or local woodworker shops with a search image in mind! Right now the choices are just a little overwhelming.

My sleep was bad, I was a nervous wreck, my OCD and anxiety were off the charts, and I wasn‚Äôt that motivated to do things without caffeine. 

Here are the improvements so far:

- Dramatically less anxiety and OCD tendencies 

- I wake up earlier now, and with more energy. Before I was always exhausted.

- More focus and a better ability to stay on task at work. 

- Emotions are not numb as before. Sad movies make me sad, good things happening make me happy, etc. 

- I‚Äôve lost almost 10 pounds. I have been going to the gym more, but I think that ties in to more energy and motivation. 


I have had 2 ‚Äúcheat days‚Äù in the last month, where I had a small iced decaf coffee. So maybe 15ish milligrams of caffeine each time on the end. I will say, it kinda felt nice.

Captain Mirarie quietly sipped her coffee while walking her morning rounds at forward operations base ‚ÄúSpearhead‚Äù. With Major Lorakian D‚Äôleth officially ‚Äúmissing in action‚Äù and no replacement likely to come any time soon, her workload had‚Ä¶ well it hadn‚Äôt necessarily increased beyond its usual levels but she was once again left as the sole ranking officer covering for all of the operational duties. As a result of the gaps in the chain of command, it was now once again left up to her to ensure everyone was fit for duty and the site remained operational. 

‚ÄúA curious thing all that,‚Äù she mused to her coffee before breathing in its aroma.


‚ÄúTalkin‚Äô to yer‚Äôself Cap?‚Äù The quiet of the mostly empty offices and fitness center had been shattered by the voice of Spider asking a question from behind and to her side. 

As startling as the woman‚Äôs sudden appearance was, the captain managed to keep from jumping, or spilling her precious morning coffee, ‚ÄúSomewhat. It relates to that fiasco your pod took the brunt of. Apparently, the Interior took an interest in my report.‚Äù She paused, letting her chew on the thought before continuing. ‚ÄúThey liked it so much that the only edits they committed  was the incident location being redacted, Major D‚Äôleth, and Specialists Syl‚Äômere and Ma‚Äôcoy  being listed officially as MIA instead of KIA. They also forbade further investigation by regulars like us. How‚Äôs the replacements treating you?‚Äù


‚ÄúNew knee and ankle‚Äôs fine, already replaced the stock servos with my own kit.‚Äù she said cheekily, still puzzling over the strange edits that had been made to the captain‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúStill a lil‚Äô weird how Trath‚Äô was basically fine after two days of bedrest and enough rations that even Spoon would‚Äôve thought twice‚Ä¶Still though, that response to your report is weird. Think they know what actually happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost certain that they have suspicions that there‚Äôs some form of a coverup, but whoever is handling it seems to be fine with it being buried.‚Äù Captain Mirarie sighed before sipping at her coffee, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs something to be grateful for, or worried about.‚Äù

Spider nodded, ‚ÄúYeah, can‚Ä¶you maybe ask again if we can recover-‚Äù she paused and tilted her head sideways. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that noise anyway?‚Äù the techie asked as she spun from her grim tone to one of genuine confusion curiosity, turning to cup her ears as she tried to pinpoint the sounds of some sort of argument muffled behind the beat of loud bassy music. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs-‚Äù 

Before she could properly form the query, the muffled music from the gym suddenly became a lot less muffled as the blast of music was immediately followed by Trath‚Äôyra shouting down the hall at someone, ‚ÄúYOU ASSHOLE! STOP RUNNING! YOU BIT ME?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that answers that?‚Äù The captain said, turning in the direction of the gym as the noise of the running argument rapidly closed in on Spider and herself, as a pale human came barreling around the corner in nothing but gym shorts and a T-shirt before skidding to a stop in front of the duo to salute, ‚ÄúHey Cap, hey Spider, ummm‚Ä¶so Trath‚Äôs pissed at me.‚Äù He said, worriedly glancing back the way he had been running from as heavy footfalls of someone in pursuit seemed to be coming from that direction at a slower, but still fast pace. ‚ÄúWe were sparring and I may have used a cheap trick to break out of a headlock.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat is not what I was-‚Äù Tharth‚Äôyra growled as she charged around the corner in nothing but hotpants and a sports bra, skidding to a dead halt as she saw the Captain, ‚Äúah crapbaskets‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been over this Tuli,‚Äù Captain Mirarie said dryly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a civilian contractor, no need to salute. Specialist Dae‚Äômenor however‚Ä¶I suppose it‚Äôs fine this time, it is Shel and no one spilled my coffee. In the future though‚Ä¶ please keep these sort of arguments to your quarters or his house,‚Äù she said nursing at her thankfully undisturbed coffee.  As she did, Tuli quietly took the initiative and with Trath‚Äôyra distracted by her commanding officer he slipped past her back back towards the direction he had come from, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt have every lover‚Äôs quarrel ending with a half-naked human running barefoot out the front door of our office and an equally undressed marine chasing after him. People in town might get‚Ä¶ odd ideas about our fob.‚Äù


Spider stuck out her tongue as her omnipad clicked, the marine snapping a photo of Trath‚Äôyra before the embarrassed marine bailed back toward the gym as well, her face flushing an impressive blue. ‚ÄúYa‚Äôknow Cap,‚Äù she said sipping her own drink, ‚ÄúThey actually ain‚Äôt got that far in their relationship yet.‚Äù

1j420gw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j420gw,"Kitchen Table (**) - London, England","Don't judge a book by its cover, and that cuts both ways. For every 'Kissing the Coronavirus' (a semenal [sic] piece of pandemic literature, which you may not figure from the cover), there's a Kitchen Table. For my money, Kitchen Table has some of the most delightful plating in the English capital. Flavours? Not so much.

Kitchen Table is a restaurant in Fitzrovia with 2 Michelin Stars that have been held since 2018, with James Knappett at the helm. James has a mighty fine CV, with stints at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Petrus (a 1 Star Ramsay restaurant), Per Se, and noma. I don't see much noma influence in the food on offer here, other than the foraged ingredients and rather stately pacing.

There are two seating areas at Kitchen Table, that together function as a parenthetical clause; the first seating area is the bar, which bookmarks your visit, with snacks being served at the beginning and the (delightful) petit-fours at the end. The meat of the meal, as it were, takes place in the horseshoe counter seating that looks onto the open kitchen. Kitchen Table self-describes as offering 'a dining experience, where full interaction with the chefs showcases previously unseen kitchen theatre'. Unseen to who, Ray Charles? This isn't The Fat Duck; there is no theatre here, just customers being given a view onto the plating station (it should be noted that little is cooked in this open kitchen, as there is another - hidden - kitchen where most of the prep work is done). I don't mind what it is, but I do mind when it's suggested to be something more.

The downside of 20 (thereabouts) covers being served the same food at the same time means that there's no room for an adjustment in pacing. What could take two hours for the number of courses on offer will take double that. In addition, if what you want out of a restaurant visit is peace and quiet, you likely won't get that. In the main dining area, where you spend most of your visit, you'll be shoulder to shoulder with other diners. Even if those next to you are reverential introverts, all it takes is one loud diner to disrupt the peace. Voices carry in this restaurant.

All of these are things to note, but ultimately - to me at least - come secondary to the food. Blow me away with tastes and textures, and the rest fades into background noise. It wasn't until the squid tagliatelle that the meal really started to get going. This came after five snacks and four courses, with the snacks being preferential to the courses; the mackerel tartlet was a good opener, fresh and slightly acidic, and preferable to the gauntlet of dullness that was the first four courses (albeit for the fruit bread). The trout roe added absolutely nothing to a rather lovely fruit bread, given just how strong the latter was. The N25 caviar was similarly wasted on the scallop dish. One-dimensionality reigned, so absent were the beginning dishes of any complexity. This didn't change with the squid tagliatelle, but it did improve. With a base of garam masala and cream, and hints of coriander, the squid tagliatelle was the best version of a Curry Pot Noodle that I've ever had (this isn't a glib comparison. I think Knappett knows what he's doing, and I'm here for it). It was nice to have something vibrant and fun, with a certain depth of flavour (barbequed peanuts were a suitable if standard addition, on both a flavour and textural level) that had been missing for the first half of the meal.

This was the turning point of the meal, and while nothing ever hit a certain 'wow' factor, there were some standouts that worked to make the first half of the meal but a hazy memory. The duck leg ragu was warm and soothing, and the apple tarte tatin with Baron Bigod brie was a wonderful (if not exactly groundbreaking) combination. The final two courses, the 72% madagascan chocolate tart and the canele, were served back in the bar area, and were outstanding.

Overall, it's hard to recommend Kitchen Table, given its status as a 2 star restaurant and the price tag that comes with it (perhaps this is something of an indictment as to the rating system of the Michelin guide, where it appears that the quality varies considerably even at the three star level). While the plating is superb, many of the dishes were rather flat, one-note creations. Despite the commendable range of ingredients used, there isn't much inspiration here, and it's for that reason that I'm surprised it's a 2 star.

She was alone, didn't know anyone, but sometimes the girls around her would smile at her and include her in jumps and choruses. She was far from home, but she didn't care in the moment; she was happy there to see her favorite musicians¬†playing all the songs that made her feel happy and strong again.¬†

She headed¬†out of the venue as everything ended, with a heavy weight on her chest, thinking about how long she would have to wait¬†to¬†see them play again. Evy loved all the colorful lights dancing throughout the venue, the jokes on the stage among the musicians and the deep live voice of the frontman.

She stopped at a 24/7 shop; her car was parked nearby. She wanted to buy something to drink and eat, something that would have last until the next morning, when she had to go back home by car. She didn't want to drive at night, she wanted to make it home safely for the sake of her beautiful daughters. Evy had left her kids with her sixteen - year - old niece, who also lived with her, and she was willing to take care of them while her aunt was away. Dawn was so happy for her aunt; that's why she wanted her to go to the concert. 

She was about to exit, after paying, when she bumped into a big tall man wearing a completely total black outfit and a red hat. She apologized and he said, in a low tone voice¬† -Don't worry -. She already knew that voice, she quickly turned her head to see those blue eyes smiling. She froze, and chills began running down her back, she didn't know what to do at first, but thought the best was to leave him alone. 

He was at the cashier with a friend, chatting and making jokes about what they had bought, then quickly headed to the exit. While they were approaching¬†the car, which was waiting for them, he turned his head, as if to look for something. She was inside her car in the parking lot, eating her chips and going through the pictures she had taken during the show, smiling at each of them and remembering every feeling she had experienced. Suddenly he knocked on the window, she froze again - Hi... - she said trembling, - Hi, is everything alright?- , -Yes... thank you...¬† -, - Are you waiting for someone? -, -No, I'm just eating my chips before going back to the hotel.. -. She was absolutely enchanted by those watercolor eyes, the only thing she could see since¬†he was wearing a mask that covered half of his face. -Did you go to the show? -, -Yes I did...¬† - she didn't¬†know if she should act like she didn't know who he was; she was afraid because she didn't want to scare him away. She had been waiting for that moment her entire life. -Don't worry - he said gently, - I can understand,¬†you know... -, -Thank you - she smiled, breathing normally again; -Is your home far from here? - he asked, -Not that much, just about an hour by car, -But you're sleeping here for tonight, right? -, -Yes, I am -, -Good - he whispered. It seemed like there wasn't so much to say between the two of them but those pauses weren't even important, they could just be there, without talking. Then he asked her -We are having a small party, do you want to come? -, -If you don't mind, it would truly be my pleasure -, -No, I don't mind - he laughed - I am inviting you -, -OK, so, yes, thank you! -, -You can leave your car here and after the party, I'll bring you back -, -Thank you, very thoughtful of you- , he laughed and she followed. She parked the car and followed suit.¬†

His friend was seated in the front and turned his head to say hi to her. She waved shyly and looked back at him -Are you sure this is alright? - Evy whispered, -Yes, don't worry, you are on me tonight - he whispered back. They reached the band's hotel where they had reserved a hall for the ""small"" party. She felt so embarrassed because of all the people that were there, instead he felt so at home,strangely also because she was there. She was introduced to some people she had heard of and her happiness¬†was all over her face. The musicians approached her and asked politely if she had enjoyed the show, she nodded yes and smiled. He offered her a drink and took her to the side where there were some small sofas. He sat¬†near her and started to talk, his smooth voice and lips shaping the words to ask her what her impressions of the show were. At the end of the story, he was talking to a fan, and he really wanted to know what she was thinking to better himself and the show. She knew he was a workaholic. They laughed a lot; she was smart and he was able to understand her witty sense of humor when there was a chance of changing the subject.¬†She was living her best life in that moment, but suddenly she felt so overwhelmed that she needed to go to the restroom, Would he have waited for her? she thought. She washed her face slowly. Evy took a glimpse at the mirror, her makeup had faded a bit, but it wasn't so much that she couldn't retouch it. She came back, but he wasn't there. She looked¬†around and masked her disappointment at not seeing him around, so took her jacket and headed out, when Steven took her wrist to stop her -Sorry, I was called by the manager-, -Oh, no, don't worry... actually I need some fresh air. Do you want to come? - she smiled and he nodded. -So, how come I am the chosen one tonight? -, he laughed -I don't know, it's just happened. Do you mind? -, -No, not at all! Are you kidding? I couldn't have asked for more... - she bursted out. She could see he was quite embarrassed, she continued -I mean... it's great to spend some time with you.... -, he smiled lightly, looking into her eyes. Though she was a stranger and he found it very hard to open up, she cared, so she didn't rush him. Evy asked about the tour dates, about how everything was going and if they had decided to make some changes along the way, wanting to make him feel at ease. The other band members came to them again and tried to have some fun with her too. There was the bassist, Tom, who was even taller than Steven and had a very funny smile. She really liked being there with all of them, Evy cared about them too. 

Steven stood there, watching, hands in the pockets of his black jeans, trying to figure out what she was hiding and what she was not. Sometimes their eyes would cross, and she would smile blindly and continue talking to the others.¬†¬†After a couple of hours she asked him to bring her back, she was tired and he could see it, Steven nodded and took the car keys. She waved at everyone as they headed out.¬†The musicians came running to give her a tight hug -See you soon - the guitarrist, Jason, said smiling. Evy nodded with a big smile on her face, hoping it would  really happen. 

The drive was short, so Steven got out of the car to walk her to hers, -Thank you, really. I didn't expect to have such a¬†great night -, -Thank you for coming and thank you for the feedback on the show - he smiled, and it was the most beautiful smile she had ever seen. She felt so drawn to him that she stood up on her toes to give him a kiss on the cheek, but he turned his head and kissed her on the lips. He could never explain why he did so, all she knew was that she felt her heart melting in fire.¬†-Don't go, please -, he told her about to cry, -Should I... -, -I don't know, please, stay here... with me... -, at that moment, she was right all along, he was the one and only. That was her secret.

From the very first moment she heard his voice and the words of his songs, she knew she had found someone with the same soul. With the mask on or off, she felt safe with him. It was like someone was watching her from far away but made her feel protected nonetheless. She had gone through more downs than ups in her life. Her pain was tangible, and she didn't know how to rise her two daughters and her niece all by herself. But from the very first moment she heard him singing, she cried, he was a mirror of her soul from another time and space. She thought she was in a lucid dream all the time, like the best - written novel. He was pure and pure sin for her and these thoughts brought many doubts in her mind. She didn't want to go with him to the party, she didn't want to fail herself because she didn't believe he would kiss her. And what a kiss. Her mind was upside down, her heart was about to burst from her chest. He could hear her heart beating and her heavy breathing going right through his soul. Steven got back and caressed her face -Give me all that you can give... -, -I give you all of me but we have to talk...¬† -, -You said you're from... -, -Watford... -, -I'll come with you. Wait for me a moment, I have to call the others-. Evy waited a few seconds with her heart pumping fast, she couldn't believe it. As he came back, she gave him her car keys, telling him which hotel she had booked. 

The room was in total darkness, when he hugged her tight. He was scared but couldn't do anything but keep her near. Slowly, he took off her clothes, first the black shirt then the pair of jeans, while kissing her, first on the lips and then going lower . Kiss by kiss, Steven brought her down, and without even realizing it, she was beneath him, trying to fight the sin he represented, striving not to  lose her mind, which was in total flames. His lips felt like fire and ice, sweet and smooth, he was hot, as if he had just emerged from a volcano. He watched her back, making her moan, while playing with his fingers on her skin. She would not have  asked for more than being played like a piano. He gently pulled her hair to bring her back to him, as he couldn't survive without her touch, turning her head. She could feel his breathing on her skin, hot and heavy, his hands on her belly, holding her tightly -You are mine now...- he said. She turned around, and it was her turn to bring him down and began to kiss his chest and his hands, the most precious things in the universe, still with some black spots. She gave him  a couple of bites, she liked to, then she looked at him deep into his eyes and replied: -I am, forever... - she pause, -Are you scared? -, -No, my perfectly misaligned lady... -, both stopped, and a endless look took place ; they took each other past the edge, and she cried like never before. He hugged her tightly again, leaving her breathless.¬†The gaze they shared was so deep and clear at the same time that they could understand what the other was thinking, what they felt, and what the future held.

The next morning Evy woke up stunned and light, as if it had been a dream, the most beautiful and sweet one. Then she turned her head and realized Steven was there, still asleep. His purity, his relaxed lips and his silenced breathing, it was clear he had something special, something that she would not have found in anyone on the Earth or in the whole universe. He slowly opened his eyes and looked back at her, smiling. -Good morning, my love -, those words were a beautiful melody in her head -Good morning my king-, he smiled again and a shiver ran down his back. Evy hugged him; his soft skin felt like a whole other universe, his defined muscles were nothing short of perfect. Where have you been she asked herself, on the verge of tears. He noticed and embraced her tightly, -I am here baby. I won't go anywhere, I am with you now -. Nothing was perfect, they were just two people in love, but their love for each other made them perfect. He ordered  room service, a black coffee for him and a caf√® latte for her with a croissant. After a couple of hours, they were heading to Watford. 

He asked her -What do you have to tell me? -, -I have two daughters. -, -Is the father around? -, -Yes, sometimes, , he comes when he can -, -Ok, perfect....How old are they? -, -One is almost six and the other is four -, -Ok... so little ones... is there anyone else? -, -My sixteen year-old niece, and my father but he is not around much -, -Ok... -.They arrived in front of the building, Evy took a deep breath and got out of the car. The two little girls, who were on the balcony, started screaming and waving at their mother. She waved back, and they headed up together. Her niece opened the door and looked puzzled for a couple of seconds, then understood and hugged her aunt. They shook hands, and the girls asked who he was; she replied -Someone special -. Boo, the oldest nickname, asked - Does this someone special have a name? -, -Sure, I have one - Steven replied, smiling -My name is Steven, nice to meet you -, he held out his hand to her, getting on his knees, and she shook it, the younger one did the same, smiling shyly.¬†She had thought it would have been hard to explain everything to her kids, but they understood easily, perhaps because of the light-filled atmosphere that they both brought inside.¬†She asked her niece if everything went smoothly and the young girl nodded positively, telling her what they had done together to pass the time. Then she played a bit with the little ones and tried to involve him. The girls accepted him without reservations and she could see happiness all over his face. In the end, that was her life: the life of a mum, a busy life, busier than his, full of commitments. Yet she would carve out a home for him, no matter what it took. She loved him more than anything, but her three girls came first, anyway. 

He understood just by looking into her eyes and accepted that he would have embraced everything: the home she would have provided him and her commitments, all of them. He would have taken all of this as a ""burden"" of his own, he didn't care. He just wanted to make her feel safe and protected, just as she made him feel she was his forever blanket on his shoulders and back. He would have not feel pain or shadows in his life anymore, no more doubts from either side, no more fear, no more dripping crimson, no more rain on their faces. 

The day went smoothly. The girls went to take some rest after lunch so that they could be alone. -Are you really sure about what you are doing? - Evy asked doubtfully, -Absolutely! Don't ask a second time!-, -Or what? You'll change your mind? -, -No, I'll just take a bite out of you! - he laughed, and growling as he leaned in towards her. She laughed hard and kissed him. Steven took her in his arms and they stood there, on the sofa, skin to skin, kissing and embracing each other in silence. 

They were meant to be together, a heavenly couple, where the love could not be measured because it had the mark of infinity.¬† ¬†

1j41zal,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Secret_Heat_7344/comments/1j41zal/part_3_atlantic/,Part 3 ATLANTIC,"Jake was in the middle of the road, standing still, watching the cars with lights on passing by. He was there, doing nothing, then a huge truck came and was about to hit him when he suddenly woke up. He was covered in sweat and had short breath. Jake sat on the bed trying to get his breathing back to normal. 

It was almost dawn, and Jack decided to go and make some coffee, still confused about the dream.

He had to go to work that morning, so he dressed up and got ready to leave the empty house. He had just moved because of this new job, so there were boxes and unpacked pieces of furniture all over the place, and he actually didn't want to be bothered to unbox everything.

He went straight to the new office, stopping only to get a black coffee and to meet his new boss and coworkers.

He wasn't excited at all, but he knew he had to do it because of what has happened in his old town, because of his family; he just wanted to stay alone, to not be asked constantly how he was.

He knew he had to go to therapy, and was the only thing that maybe he was really interested in; the others were just a side thing. It wasn't that he didn't want to live, but the weight he felt on his shoulder because of the society and the expectations of others had on him didn't suit him and his way of thinking.

The first day went smoothly, without any sort of problem, but then, in the evening, every drop of solitude and emptiness took over, as a huge black shade just alighted on his back, making his soul heavier. 

Days went by like he was a robot; luckily nobody at work seemed to notice the constant veil of melancholy on his face; nobody knew him, and nobody asked.

One day, while taking a bath, his eyes rested for some seconds on the scars he had made. The deepness of his sadness was palpable, much that himself could feel his body getting colder. 

One night, again, a dream like the first one, but this time he was driving, and that truck was about to hit him, he swerved sharply and hit the guardrail. He woke up suddenly, again covered in sweat. He couldn't understand the meaning of that dream. It was a Sunday, it was before dawn, he tried to fall asleep again, but couldn't; he was scared to dream of the track again.

A couple of days later, he stopped again at the cafeteria to get a take-away black coffee as always and bumped into a girl that was behind his back in the queue. -I'm so sorry. Have I hurt you? -, -No, no, don't worry. I'm fine -, -Thank God... Sorry I have to go. Have a nice day -, -You too. - she smiled. Her smile locked him in. He walked away instantly; he didn't want to be involved. Eventually he thought about that smile all day long, secretly and deeply wishing he could meet that girl again. He wondered how a smile could make him feel different. 

He had actually forgotten about love. He knew he didn't feel good in love, so he had hoped he would feel good without.  

Jake had a girlfriend before moving, before he harmed himself. Those were the most turbulent four years of his life. He loved her so much, but all of his demons, at some point, took over his head. No one had ever understood why he reacted in that way, he just felt inadequate, ugly, and lost without, in everyone's eyes, any reasonable explanations. Every morning and during the day he would feel himself pulled under, like into the water, sinking. She tried numerous times to talk to him, even to tell his family something was wrong, but without success. He was so strong on the outside, doing his things, his job, going out with her to have fun. But sometimes, he would just sit on the chair, going with the flow of his emotion and breaking down in tears. Sometimes she would be there with him, trying to soothe his pain, but sometimes he was alone, and these moments hurt the most. His demons just came on the outside, in front of his eyes, making him scream all the anger and the sadness he had in his heart. He didn't feel happy; he masked all the pain inside, and one day he decided to end his life. 

He took a blade and made two, three cuts along his arms to make the blood flow faster; he lost his senses in a couple of minutes. His girlfriend saw him when she came back home from work, he was unconscious. She called the ambulance quickly and then his family to let them know what happened.

He woke up a couple of days later from the coma; he had risked losing his life that evening. The blood he had still in his body was very little when the ambulance reached the ER.

He saw, near his bed, his parents and his girlfriend looking at him with frozen planets, orbiting around him; they acknowledged the pain he felt but didn't understand what it was for him.

He didn't want to live anymore and wanted to crush into sand, to not be found, to not be seen anymore, like a body buried underwater, going deep in the dark of the ocean.

All of these memories hurt him; that was the reason he escaped the situation, moving to another city with what was supposed to be a new life. He loved his girlfriend, but she was forced to leave him because he didn't want to understand what his situation was to her. She had struggled also near him, trying to help him, trying to understand what was wrong, draining all of her energies in something that didn't turn back in a good way.

This new girl captivated him; her aura was so magnetic that he couldn't pull back. He hoped, the days after, to meet her again, and one of those days he did.

Jake approached her and asked her name; she smiled; she recollected the bumping. They had a small talk and he offered her a coffee. 

Her name was Lizzy, and she worked at the animal shelter near the cafeteria.

They exchanged their phone numbers, and, to her surprise, he texted her the same afternoon, asking her to go out. 

That night was all he needed to come back to his old, happy self, at least for a couple of hours. He felt like a stoic statue, fit for nobody. Lizzi gave him a chance, with a smile, to dissolve his shadow.

They had been to a restaurant, and then he bought an ice cream for both. He didn't want to disclose everything about her that same night, so Jake just took her back home and came back to his.

After a couple of months, the couple was much closer, their dates were smooth, relaxing, and funny. Jake was so happy he had asked Lizzy to go out, and she was too. She would never imagine he was so funny, sweet, and caring, she thanked the sky for letting her meet him. 

They had the first night together at some point. Jake went to Lizzy's house to have dinner together. He helped prepare the dishes, cutting the vegetables, and served her some red wine while cooking. He also brought her some flowers, so she set up a vase for them in the middle of the table. 

After a while, after chatting about everything they could, he asked her gently -Can I ask you something? -, -Sure, what is it? -, -Do you think, at this point, we can go upstairs together? -. Lizzy smiled embarrassedly and nodded. He smiled happily and, standing up, he held out his hand to her and kissed hers. He took her in her bedroom, with her directions. 

He started kissing her with such sweetness and passion that she could not understand what he would do next. So Lizzy took the initiative and made him sit and undressed herself, then kissed him, and he pulled her towards him on the bed. -I want to know everything about you -, -Tell me what you've lost; show me what wounds you've got. -. He stopped for a moment and looked her in the eyes. She was sincere; she didn't hide her love for him, she was willing to hear everything. They passed together the edge and hugged tightly as nothing was around them, as they were completely alone in their life. 

Both of them didn't want to sleep, so they went downstairs to drink some tea together. 

Jake started to tell her about his previous life; he didn't want to uncover everything in that moment, but she asked because she had understood that something big had happened. -So, do you really want to know the truth? -, -Yes -, -Will you run from me? -, -Absolutely not!-, -I attempted suicide eight months ago; that's why I ran away from my birthplace. My ex-girlfriend left me because she had carried the weight of two; she was totally drained, and I am so sorry for her. I never really apologised to her, even though I think about it a lot. -, she interrupted him. -Then do it. No one will blame you if you want to say sorry to her -, -Can I? -, -Sure, I don't have problems with that. That's an old story; you just have to close it for your own good, but you have to do it in the right way. Do you still go to therapy? -, -Yes, I have never left it... since I woke up from the coma. -, -Good, I am happy to hear it; that means you care about your life now. -, -I am, I would never meet you if I was dead.  -, -Thank you, that means a lot to me -, -It's the truth; you lighted up my day with your smile, the day we first met. And I will never thank you enough for what you have done for me until now. -, -I love you, Jake; this is the bare minimum when you love someone. And for everything you went through, I'll be here no matter what. You can tell me whatever comes into your mind, whenever you are sad or happy. I am here; I'll listen. -. He kissed her so strong, she was so sure about her feelings for him that Jake felt, somehow, intimidated by her but at the same time, he felt he could trust her totally. 



They were in the car one night, coming back home from a birthday party, Lizzy's friend, and, as they were listening to music, going not so fast, a truck invaded their lane. Jake was a bit drunk, so he couldn't realise fast enough he should turn the steering wheel. When he did, he was going against the guardrail; he tried to press the brake, but it was too late. The car broke through the guardrail and fell into the river. They both couldn't, at the moment, understand what was happening, as the car hovered in the air, until the car hit the cold water. Despite  windows being down, the seatbelts were tight, they couldn't escape, and the water was flooding in the car. Jake looked at Lizzy; she had blood on her face and was crying. He couldn't let her die because of him. He gathered all of his strength and broke both of the seatbelts, with his little hold breath. 

Swimming to get to the surface, he realised he had his ribs broken and his right leg was hurt. Lizzy tried to help him, noticing his pain, but he held her and brought her to the surface.

There was already an ambulance waiting for them as they reached the shore and passed out.

Jake woke up in the hospital, some hours later, knowing what had happened, but he couldn't remember anything. A doctor approached him, as he realised Jake had woken up, and asked a couple of questions to understand the situation. -Do you remember your name?-, -Yes, it's Jake Evans -, -Do you know what date it is? -, -Yes, it's the November 28th -, -Ok, perfect. Your memory is fine. Did you remember what happened last night? -, -I only remember my girlfriend and I were at a party at some friends' house... - he paused. -Do you remember anything else? -, -No... what happened?- he had terrors in his eyes. -You both had a car accident; a truck invaded your lane, and your car fell into the river. -, -How is Lizzy? - he asked, scared -. The doctor was hesitant, and Jake asked again, with anger -How is my girlfriend? -, the doctor kept avoiding. Jake started to scream, trying to escape from all the IV lines on his arms -Where is she? -, a nurse rushed into the room and tried to calm him down. But he screamed again, and the nurse nodded to the doctor, who went out. -My love, she is in a coma; she has too much internal bleeding. The doctors don't know if she will wake up- she said regretfully. Jake began to scream, with all his sorrow, so loud he could feel his own heartbeat going faster and faster. -No. No. Lizzy -.



\-My love, are you alright? -, Lizzy woke him up; she understood that there was something bad going on. -Jake was covered in sweat and was breathing heavily. He turned his head and saw her, harmless and safe. He broke down in tears as she hugged him. He was sobbing -I don't want to hurt you; I don't want to be the bad guy. I love you; I don't want to hurt you -, -You won't, my love, you won't. Don't worry, everything is fine.-

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve observed:

**Setup:**¬†I have a home server router running WireGuard, with a travel router (GL.iNet) that connects via the WireGuard client to my home server.

**Working Networks:**¬†I‚Äôve successfully connected to the VPN using mobile hotspot from my phone to my travel router, connecting my travel router to my ISP router wifi connection at my house, my girlfriend‚Äôs house, and a coffee shop Wi-Fi.

**Non-Working Networks:**¬†However, it doesn‚Äôt work at my brother-in-law‚Äôs house or at my friend‚Äôs house. Both have different ISPs and routers.

**Mobile vs Laptop:**¬†the laptop (travel router to server router) does not connect in those non-working networks. On the Non-Working Networks, the Android phone was able to connect to those wifi networks and connect to the VPN, which is weird.

**I‚Äôve looked into a few possibilities:**

* **Port Blocking:**¬†Some networks may block WireGuard‚Äôs default port (51820). However, if it worked on the Android phone connected to the same network, it's weird for me that it just blocks the UDP port for traffic from the laptop and not from the phone.
* **MTU Issues:**¬†I read about changing the MTU to a smaller value, tried changing it on the travel client configuration while I was at my brother-in-law's house, and it didn't work.
* **DNS:**¬†I‚Äôm using¬†[8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8/)¬†as my DNS server on the client side (travel router) in the travel router configuration.
* **Subnet Conflict:**¬†My home network (where my server router is hosted) is within the¬†[192.168.1.0/24](http://192.168.1.0/24)¬†subnet. Could changing this be a fix?
* **Additional Info:**¬†I have 2 Opal devices, and I‚Äôm also considering switching to Tailscale for my VPN setup.

1j41tv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WireGuard/comments/1j41tv3/issues_with_wireguard_vpn_connectivity_on_certain/,Issues with WireGuard VPN Connectivity on Certain Networks/Devices - Need Help,"I‚Äôm currently setting up a WireGuard VPN using a GL.iNet router for remote work, and I‚Äôm encountering issues with connecting on some networks, even though it works fine on others. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve observed:

**Setup:** I have a home server router running WireGuard, with a travel router (GL.iNet) that connects via the WireGuard client to my home server.

**Working Networks:** I‚Äôve successfully connected to the VPN using mobile hotspot from my phone to my travel router, connecting my travel router to my ISP router wifi connection at my house, my girlfriend‚Äôs house, and a coffee shop Wi-Fi.

**Non-Working Networks:** However, it doesn‚Äôt work at my brother-in-law‚Äôs house or at my friend‚Äôs house. Both have different ISPs and routers.

**Mobile vs Laptop:** the laptop (travel router to server router) does not connect in those non-working networks. On the Non-Working Networks, the Android phone was able to connect to those wifi networks and connect to the VPN, which is weird.

**I‚Äôve looked into a few possibilities:**

* **Port Blocking:** Some networks may block WireGuard‚Äôs default port (51820). However, if it worked on the Android phone connected to the same network, it's weird for me that it just blocks the UDP port for traffic from the laptop and not from the phone.
* **MTU Issues:** I read about changing the MTU to a smaller value, tried changing it on the travel client configuration while I was at my brother-in-law's house, and it didn't work.
* **DNS:** I‚Äôm using [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) as my DNS server on the client side (travel router) in the travel router configuration.
* **Subnet Conflict:** There could be IP conflicts with the local network‚Äôs subnet, causing traffic to stay local rather than going through the VPN. My home network (where my server router is hosted) is within the [192.168.1.0/24](http://192.168.1.0/24) subnet. Could changing this be a fix?
* **Additional Info:** I have 2 Opal devices, and I‚Äôm also considering switching to Tailscale for my VPN setup.

(Before you come in here and say that something may be wrong medically, he has been to 3 different vets just in case and received a clean bill of health from all of them)","I got my husky puppy when he was 10 weeks old. I had the help of a trainer shortly after I got him to assist in things like recall, resource guarding, socialization, leash manners, crate training, etc. Everything  went great and he has become a great dog in that regard.

My problem now is that as of the time he turned ~10 months until now (he is 14 months) all he does is whine/cry and it continues to get worse. My trainer has told me to simply ignore it, but it is getting impossible. 

He cries/whines when my alarm goes off in the morning until I get out of bed. When I get out of bed to go to the bathroom, he sits at the bathroom door and continues whining. When I am downstairs getting my morning coffee ready, he cries at the back door until we go for our hour long morning walk. When we get back from our walk, he cries/whines because he wanted the walk to be longer. He cries/whines when I am getting his breakfast ready. It happens when I come home from work for our hour long lunchtime walk because I was gone and when I am getting him ready for the lunch time walk. It happens when I get home from work for the day. If I sit on the couch too long to relax after work, he starts again because he wants another walk. When we get back from our afternoon walk, guess what, he is whining because he is bored in the house. He whines more when I am getting his dinner ready, after his dinner because he is bored, if I don't play with him long enough, if I get up to leave the room he follows me around the house doing it, before and after his evening walk, when I am in the shower, and when I am getting ready for bed.

It seems like if he is awake, he is whining/crying the ENTIRE time. I have tried ignoring it, I have tried addressing it, NOTHING seems to work. My significant other has repeatedly said to get another dog for him, but I refuse to get another dog to address a problem with my current dog. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Does it get better/is it because he is still young? Any tips on how to minimize the whining/crying? I am really starting to get fed up because all it does is stress me out!",0,1741177002.0,dogs,25,0.22,False
1j41q4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims4/comments/1j41q4a/a_few_gameplay_ideas_ive_had_for_the_new_pack/,A few gameplay ideas I‚Äôve had for the new pack (Businesses & Hobbies),"I‚Äôm really excited about this pack! Here‚Äôs some ideas - 

BOTANICAL GARDENS: neat landscape gardens, statue gardens, a maze, lake, picnic areas. Charge sims entry to enjoy the gardens and you could also have a garden shop inside which sells plants and gifts. If you‚Äôre in the uk, think like National Trust places. (I‚Äôm building one at the moment if anyone‚Äôs interested I can upload it to the gallery) 


ORCHARD / PICK YOUR OWN: an orchard where sims can pick their own fruit and veg. Could have rows of apple trees and strawberry/blackberry bushes. I used to love visiting these as a kid!
You could host events in different seasons like decorate it at Halloween and grow pumpkins for sims to pick and could set up pumpkin carving stations. Charge sims an entry fee or hourly fee for them to pick their fruit and veg. 
You could also have a workspace where you host lectures on gardening or flower arranging. 

CAMPSITE & FISHERY: a lot with a large lake that sims pay entry to fish at. You could host fishing lectures. You could also include a campsite as in real life some people like to night fish. Include tents and a picnic area. 
ADD ON - have a small shop that sells fishing themed goods like paintings, photographs and mounted fish. 

CAFE WITH PLAY AREA: I remember going to pubs that had play areas in as a kid. You could run a pub/cafe that has a play area attached. Adult sims could enjoy a coffee whilst their children play. Could have ball pits and climbing frames etc. 

GAMING SHOP: a video games shop that sells collectibles like the mysims figures. You could charge hourly and have a room with computers in so sims could pay to play video games. You could include arcade machines too. Maybe a cafe bar as well. Somewhere gamers can go to play games and shop. 
ADD ON - your sim could write sci-fi novels (not sure if you can sell these books in the shop) but is a good addition to this business idea. 

SCHOOL FOR ADULTS - a place that teaches lectures for adults. What if your sim dropped out of high school and later in life wanted to learn a trade? You could host lectures such as handiness.
In real life adults can go to things like ‚Äònight school‚Äô. 

A different version of this could be hobby classes. Sims could take a cooking class or flower arranging class for fun to learn something new.

Part time jobs - 

VIOLIN TEACHER - host lectures for children/teens to learn the violin. Could be a good side job as you could teach classes after school. 

CHILDREN‚ÄôS CRAFT CLUB - have activity tables and other craft activities for kids. Similar to the violin teacher you could host this as after school club. Could do the same with a homework club for children or teens.

Okay so this just happened and I am genuinely not sure if we both communicated shitty or if either of us is overreacting.

The bigger picture: my husband and I struggled for a while as a couple, tried to work on it though. He used to use Darvo on me until I pointed it out to him, now he is trying to work on it. 
I for my part often don't communicate clearly, been working on that too. 

Some context from my perspective: The other day I saw a reel of a woman saying that you're not fine in your relationship (or are not in the place where you belong, something like that) if you don't feel peaceful and calm in your own home. 
And it struck me that I rarely do. I have a lot of internal stress and anxiety, and that's on me. I am the one who has to deal with that. 
I also realized though that I try to be ""inconspicuous"" around my husband and drop everything when he enters the room. 
I will put my phone down or stop the TV or just turn to him from whatever I am doing at that moment. And most days it's fine, I like to interact with him. I realized though that I always do this, even if I would like to keep watching or reading or whatever, because he is EXPECTING IT. 
Because I know that my husband would not like it if I not immediately establish contact if we happen to be in the same space. 
I can't just mind my own business and peacefully coexist. 

So I was getting all in my head about this and thought, well maybe it's just in my head, and I could do whatever I want without it being a big deal. 
So I did today. 
And it backfired. 

We were in the kitchen this morning, I was eating breakfast, he had a coffee. We were just sitting there, we had talked before, but weren't anymore, so I thought I could take my phone and look at it. 
He immediately got up, visibly annoyed and left the room. 

And now just an hour ago we were in the same spot again, I was reading and having a snack and I didn't drop my book like I use to when he entered. He sat there for a while, watching me intently. 

Then this conversion happened and I will just type it out and if you could please tell me what you think about it. 
I am at a loss, truly. 

Husband asked:

""is something up? You ignore me and seem annoyed"" 

""Well I am a bit, to be honest. I am feeling watched and like I can't do what I like to do cause you observe me and give me feedback on every change in my mood. It's stressful.""

""whoa you don't need to make a general thing out of it, I was just asking how you are, cause you are sitting there avoiding me, not making eye contact and you seem annoyed"" 

Me: ""Yeah that's exactly what I mean, I would just like to sit here and read, and not having my mood and everything else analysed. It's like I can't ever be just in a bad mood or just not being that chatty or just do what I want even though we are in the same room and I don't like it. So yes I am annoyed. ""

""Why are you being so aggressive? I just wanted to know what's wrong and you're making this big deal out of it, you know what, I can't do that, I am going.""

And he stormed out, slamming doors on his way. 

I'm so confused.
It's me, isn't it? I should have better communicated and not make a general thing out of it. ",4,1741176887.0,breakingmom,6,0.83,False

1j41nwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1j41nwv/which_novels_capture_a_similar_spookycozy_vibe_as/,"Which novels capture a similar spooky/cozy vibe as Agent Cooper thinking, sleeping, dreaming and coffee-ing in the Great Northern Hotel in seasons 1 and 2?","I'm looking for a novel where the setting functions similarly. It is a mysterious place. It might be another hotel, or a castle, library, etc. But in any case it is an atmospheric ""home base"" for the protagonist, like The Great Northern. 

I'll try to explain in greater detail.

As most of you surely know, in Twin Peaks season 1 and 2 much attention is paid to the space of the Great Northern Hotel -- its rooms, halls, rituals, creature comforts. [Rest and reflection often accompanied the end of the Cooper's day at the hotel](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1itj57b/real_talk/#lightbox). 

But nights at the Great Northern, in the Gothic tradition, are also enchanted with mystery and/or haunted with unease. The morning, meanwhile, brings the exhilarations of [breakfast](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/euowj2/the_peak_of_coops_charm/#lightbox) and [coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/z00tdx/a_damn_fine_cup_of_coffee/), and opportunities for more reflection, including pondering the previous night's dreams/nightmares. 

There is a real sense of place to the Great Northern, with the sounds of the other occupants coming through the walls, and strange visitors appearing in the night, and the show's fundamental sense of mystery and darkness still present but at a somewhat safe remove (or at least *apparently* safe), like a thunder storm discerned from one's bedroom.
