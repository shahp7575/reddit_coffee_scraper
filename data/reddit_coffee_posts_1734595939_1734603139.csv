1hhprpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hhprpl/starting_over_in_home_town/,Starting over in home town,"I returned to my home town and am starting over.  While I was packing up my things from my boyfriend’s place, I couldn’t find my really nice knife set.  When I had moved in, I specifically said I would save it even though he had a decent set.  Mine was better, but of course he insisted his was.  I kept mine wrapped with movers’ paper and tape in the garage.  I noticed a few of my things he had thrown out over the 7 months I had lived there.  But, when I was moving out, I noticed the knife set.  I spent over a week shopping for this set.  German steel with black, sleek handles and a set of kitchen sheers.  Nowhere in the garage.  And not even donated.  He would get in a mood of throwing out my things if he felt the place was cluttered.  Even if it was the garage and things weren’t cluttered, just he didn’t understand why they were there.  He once complained for three days that I had tweezers on the coffee table even though he had a pen.  His pen wasn’t a problem, but my tweezers were.  

I don’t know why the knife set is such a trigger for me.  He gave me his knife set when I left, which makes me feel like he knows he threw them out.  I supported him for 7 months.  I had to stay quiet during his bad moods.  He wanted me to forgive and forget when he broke two of my plates and a coffee mug of sentimental value.  And I feel the only reason he was upset at my leaving was that I wouldn’t be supporting him anymore.  ",1,1734602947.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

5. [Hanaroro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtAXQ-DPAh0&pp=ygUPaGFucm9ybyBwcm9maWxl)

Songs: ㅈㅣㅂ, 나침반, 귀가

Album: N/A

*My fifth favorite artist of 2024 is my discovery of the year. Hanaroro is an indie artist who popped out of nowhere with her album Home, which was on my top 10 album list. One cool fact about the singer is that she helped write and work on Stepping Stone by TXT and wrote the lyrics for Nightmare by Taeyeon. I did check out her past releases and enjoyed them as I kept returning to them. Hanroro's sweet voice blends wonderfully with the production she brings to the table. I've noticed my love for Korean indie has grown over the years, and Hanroro is another one I can add to the list of indie singers that captivate me with their singing and production.*

Songs: Born to Be, Five & Blossom (Lia Solo)

Album: Gold

*ITZY hopped onto my list as the swang into 2024 with an album that hit hard. Born to Be was an album that kept pulling me back for more, but one missing thing was Lia, who was on hiatus. Lia delivered Blossom, which was a tune that warmed my heart. Even the other solos from the members were fire. We did get a new Japanese single called Algorhytm, which was another thing that was on repeat for me. When Lia returned to the group from Hiatus, the group released Gold, which had some Final versions of Born to Be tracks plus new tunes. I've been obsessed with Gold as it's been on repeat for me since October, and it excites me for what 2025 will bring to the table.*

3.[ IVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0msDnSADBA&pp=ygURaSd2ZSBwcm9maWxlIDIwMjQ%3D)



Songs: Ice Queen, Crush & Supernova Love

Album: N/A

*IVE opened the year with All Night, an English remake of Icona Pop's song All Night, but this version featured Saweetie. IVE and Saweetie still don't make me like the track. I found it something that made me worried for the group's year. The second thing IVE did this year was release Will, the theme song for Pokemon Horizons, which I got the theme stuck in my head as I've been listening to it on repeat. The group released their second mini album, one I remember listening to a lot as the songs were something I enjoyed, but Reset was the only skip for me. In August, the group released Alive, their second Japanese album that included Will and Crush. Both were pre-released and are still some of my favorite tracks. The group recently dropped Supernova Love with David Guetta; I've been playing that a lot. IVE had a rocky start to the year, but the group proved that this year would be great for them, making me even more of a fan.*

2. [Candy Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fYfuXsBf0Y&pp=ygUXY2FuZHkgc2hvcCBwcm9maWxlIDIwMjQ%3D)



Songs: Good Girl, Tumbler (Hot & Cold) & No Fake

Album: #Hashtag

*Candy Shop, the newest group from Brave Sound, debuted with their first mini album in March of 2024. The record became one of my obsessions that month, as I couldn't stop listening to it. It's hard for me to pick a favorite song from their debut, as I love all the tunes that they offer. The group's smooth vocals kept pulling me back to these catchy tunes that stuck with me for a while. In June of 2024, the group returned with their second mini album, another catchy one that also stuck with me. Hot & Cold is a b-side from that project that became one of my favorites, but the whole album is just as good as their debut. I can't believe Candy Shop became my second favorite group of 2024, and it didn't take them long to do so.*

1.[ ILLIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUIM3OVYRAk&pp=ygUSaWxsaXQgcHJvZmlsZSAyMDI0)



Songs: N/A

Album:N/A

*My favorite female artist of the year comes from Belift, the home of Enhypen. ILLIT is the catchiest group and artist of 2024, and their music has been stuck in my head all year long. Their debut album, Super Real Me, delivered a song called Midnight Fiction that ended up on my top 20 song list. The title track, Magnetic, was another favorite of mine, and it did get three remixes that also kept popping up on my playlist. I love how sweet the member's vocals are, as they are one thing that helps bring me back to their music. In October, the group delivered I'll Show You, their second mini album with even more catchy pop tunes to keep my ears wanting more. Cherish was the title track that also got some remixes like Magnetic did, but it's hard to pick which title track I like more. The B-side Pimple showed the group's acoustic side, which I loved. Tick-tack might be the group's catchiest song, as it's been stuck in my head since I released. I'm not surprised ILLIT took over my year, as they've been stuck in my head since their debut.*

1hhpof6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hhpof6/aio_for_feeling_excluded_whenever_i_hang_out_with/,AIO for feeling excluded whenever I hang out with my friends?,"Me (24F) and a few of my high school friends Traci (24F), Caleb (24M), and Daniel (24M) have a kinda weird dynamic where the guys (who are very close “bros”) are much better friends with Traci than with me. While me and the guys are friendly, we don’t really talk or hang out unless Traci is there, and since Traci and I are very close friends, the four of us usually hang out together.

I study out-of-state for grad school but whenever I come back I always try to hang out with them at least once before going back to school. I began to notice a pattern since last year where I sometimes feel excluded or left out during these get togethers. 

For example, last year over dinner, Daniel made a huge fuss about paying the tab, but specifically for Caleb and Traci, not me. He went so far as to snatch and hide the receipt from Traci so she couldn’t see the total, but also whispering the total to me so I know how much to venmo for my share of dinner. 

Now I NEVER expect someone else to cover my bill, in fact I make sure to always venmo my portion of the bill before we even leave the restaurant. However seeing the huge ordeal Daniel made to pay for everyone’s tab EXCEPT mine made me feel so excluded. I would obviously still pay my fair share but an offer would still be nice. But then I felt extremely guilty for even expecting someone else to offer to pay for my tab and figured I was overreacting or thinking too much of it.

But then later that same night, Daniel was kind enough to drive us girls back home as it was late. From the restaurant, my apartment is closest and Traci’s house is about another 10-15min further. However, instead of dropping me off first since it’s on the way, he made the effort to make sure Traci got home first, even if it meant doubling back around. No big deal, Traci had work early the next morning while I’m on break from school so I wrote that off too.

This year, the four of us hung out again and since Daniel’s birthday is coming up soon, the three of us decided to chip in and get him a cake and Caleb offered to host it at his house. When Daniel was cutting the cake, he cut four slices but midway through, Caleb’s parent changed their mind about wanting a piece (they initially declined a slice) and Daniel handed them one of the four slices -completely understandable, no big deal there’s plenty of cake to go around. 

But by then everyone settled down and began eating their cake. Except I didn’t have a slice. So while the three were in conversation, I causally cut myself a piece of cake. A little embarrassing to be honest, and I’ll admit I was a bit hurt since I was literally sitting next to Daniel who was actively eating cake while I held an empty plate, but also not that much of a big deal.

Again later the same night, Caleb offered us hot beverages to go with the cake. Daniel and Traci were deciding between coffee or tea, and I said “coffee sounds good!” thinking all of us would get to enjoy coffee and cake (and help make a decision for them since they were kinda locked in an indecisive battle). But when Caleb returned, he only brought out two mugs, one for Traci and one for Daniel (he himself didn’t want caffeine at night), but again, nothing for me. 

At first I thought ‘oh he probably only brought two at a time since he only has two hands’ but after he brought the two cups he sat back down with us to continue chatting. I felt so excluded but then also felt guilty once again that I felt entitled to someone else’s hospitality.

I don’t think they do it maliciously or on purpose. The four of us honestly get along and we joke/bicker/roast each other often. But these haven’t been isolated incidents and some variation pretty much happens every time the four of us hang out together. 

Both Daniel and Caleb have had one-sided crushes on Traci before in the past, which may play a part since I’m more of an acquaintance to the guys. But even so, I can’t help but feel like a third wheel whenever the four of us hang out. I know if the roles were reversed I would always make sure everyone feels included and no one is left out, but once again I feel guilty for having such expectations.

# We Get It. You Hate Shopping in the Stores! So Do We.

Have you ever gone to the store to buy clothing only to be frustrated that you can’t find your size or there is poor selection? Have you tried to find a salesclerk to help, only to find the person sitting on their butt (“quietly quitting”) with a crummy attitude annoyed that you are interrupting their fixation on TikTok? Have there been moments that you just want to ring someone’s neck while you are standing in line with people angry that it is taking way too long. How about trying on clothes and nothing fits, and you just want to stomp on the clothing saying “F\*\*\* THIS!”

If you have said yes to any of the above, then it’s time to have your clothing custom-made!

# A True Luxury Clothing Experience.

Now imagine yourself in a cozy comfortable showroom setting. A friendly person greets you offering a cold glass of water, coffee, or tea. Instead of imposing their opinion, your designer/stylist asks you what YOU want and happily looks at the inspiration you just love that you found on social media, or we will make suggestions for you. Whether you are looking for that perfect custom made tuxedo, wedding suit, or perhaps you are in need of a wardrobe, for business such as a custom suit, custom sport coat, custom dress slacks, custom knit wear, custom jeans, custom made overcoat or a tailored dress shirt, your clothier will show you an array of beautiful fabrics, linings and buttons to choose from.

# We Take A LOT Of Measurements. Seriously!

Over 23 key measurements will be taken, including your posture and shoulder slope. To get a better feel for the proportions try-on samples will also be used. For a suit or other custom clothing items to fit perfectly, it’s all in the skill of the master tailor’s measurements.

# Where Are the Fabrics From?

[**GIORGENTI custom clothing**](https://www.giorgenti.com/mens-custom-clothing/) sources the globe for the finest fabrics for custom jeans, custom sweaters, custom made overcoats, custom tailored dress shirts, custom made suits, custom made tuxedos, tailored sport coats and dress pants.

We use the finest European mills including Loro Piana, Zegna, Vitale Barberis Canonico, and Dormeuil just to name a few.

# How Is the Clothing Made?

With a lot of love and care! A custom-made suit is made with an emphasis on meticulous attention to detail to create a perfect fit. There is a lot of handwork involved. After the measurements are taken a pattern is made from the man or woman’s body. The pattern is cut out of fabric using laser technology, or by hand using scissors and a special cutting mat. Then the pieces are sewn together by a master tailor to create the garment. Added details such as buttons, zippers, and pockets can be added to the finished product as desired. The suit is then inspected and pressed.

All GIORGENTI custom tuxedos, suits, and overcoats are made with a canvas front. That is the pride of a truly custom made garment. The “canvas” is in the chest area and helps reinforce the shape of the coat. It creates an additional layer between the body and the jacket resulting in an improved fit and more comfortable wear.

# How Long Does It Take to Get Custom Made Clothing?

There are several factors. Do you need a custom tuxedo or a wedding suit for that special day in your life? Or are you choosing a custom made suit, custom sport coat and dress pants for work or for a special occasion? Do you need to freshen up your dress shirts and want custom made dress shirts, so they fit you properly? Perhaps you need a custom overcoat or raincoat. If your job allows it, you may want custom made jeans. Knits are comfortable and for an upscale business casual look you may want a custom made sweater or knit top. Depending on the clothing item and whether we have the fabric in stock or must order it from Italy, custom clothing can take within five to eight weeks.

# Where Do I Get GIORGENTI Custom Clothing?

GIORGENTI custom customers come from all over the tri-state area. We are conveniently located in Garden City, New York. You can drive or take the Long Island railroad to the Mineola train station where we are only a few minutes’ walk.

GIORGENTI customers come from Queens New York, Long Island, Brooklyn New York, Statin Island, Manhattan, New York City, the Bronx, Westchester, NYC, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

1hhphw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OWLCITY/comments/1hhphw6/owl_city_from_synth_dreams_to_boring_diary_entries/,Owl City: From Synth Dreams to Boring Diary Entries,"Adam, if you’re reading this, grab some tissues because this is gonna sting.

Remember when you were Owl City? Back when you gave us euphoric synth waves, the sound of dreams, and lyrics that felt like they belonged in an enchanted forest of imagination? Yeah, well, those days are dead. Owl City didn’t evolve, it didn’t mature, it flatlined. The magic fizzled out like a birthday candle no one bothered to relight, and now we’re left listening to what sounds like the soundtrack to a discount yoghurt commercial.

The Fall of a Dreamer

It started with Mobile Orchestra. That was when the cracks showed. Instead of gliding through the galaxy on neon stardust, we got half-baked, radio-bait pop that reeked of desperation. Did anyone ask for a country song featuring Jake Owen? No. But there it was. It felt like Adam threw darts at a genre board and decided, “Yeah, let’s just do everything and hope it sticks.” Spoiler: it didn’t.

Then came Cinematic. Adam, did someone tell you we wanted a Spotify sponsored podcast about your life? Because we didn’t. We don’t care about the time you drank Fiji Water and we don’t really care about your friends. These aren’t songs, they’re diary entries over Casio presets.

Owl City used to be a place to escape. Now it’s a place where we’re trapped in the mundane tales of Adam Young: Local Coffee Shop Enthusiast. I don’t need a 5 minute song about you working at a store.

Coco Moon: Stock Music Hell

Let’s talk about Coco Moon, your latest trainwreck. This isn’t art; it’s background noise for a YouTube tutorial on how to clean your gutters. It’s so polished and soulless, I half expect to hear a “Visit your nearest Toyota dealership today!” voiceover midway through.

Where’s the mystique, Adam? Where’s the weirdness we loved? Where are the strawberry avalanches and fireflies? Instead, we’re stuck with “Adam’s Greatest Hits of Mildly Interesting Life Events.” The Owl City magic, the weird, nonsensical escapism… is gone. You’ve traded wonder for Walmart. It’s painfully clean, painfully normal, painfully… boring.

Up to the Cloud: The Last Gasp

“Up to the Cloud” was the last time Owl City felt like Owl City. That track shimmered. It had the charm, the glittering synths, the intangible magic we fell in love with. It reminded us of who you used to be: a bedroom producer who could transport us to an alternate dimension in 3 minutes flat.

But now? You’ve chained yourself to reality. You’ve stripped away the magic and given us the equivalent of reading someone’s LinkedIn profile set to music.

Counterarguments You’re Thinking of (And Why They’re Wrong)

“He’s matured, stop wanting him to be the same!”
Mature? This isn’t maturity; this is creative bankruptcy. Owl City’s early work was joyful because it was an escape. That was your magic trick. Growth doesn’t mean abandoning your identity. It means taking it somewhere new without losing what made you special. Coco Moon and Cinematic don’t feel like growth; they feel like surrender.

“You’re just nostalgic for Fireflies.”
Wrong. I’m nostalgic for creativity. For the bizarre, borderline nonsensical poetry that turned everyday moments into something enchanting. Your new songs are about literal shops, stolen stories, and childhood memories. That’s not magical; that’s aggressively pedestrian.

“He’s a better producer now!”
Sure, the production is technically spotless, but who cares if the music itself feels lifeless? Polishing a turd doesn’t stop it being a turd. You’ve nailed the sound of royalty free background tracks, Adam. Congrats.

Where It All Went Wrong

Adam, I’ll level with you: it feels like you got comfortable. Owl City once sounded like a someone daydreaming at 3AM, scribbling down impossible, beautiful ideas. Now it sounds like you’re clocking in and clocking out, writing songs because you have to.

You were the guy who gave us:
“I’d rather waltz than just walk through the forest”
“You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies lit up the world as I fell asleep”

Now you’re the guy who gives us:
“So thank you kindly I owe ya, Hy-Vee.”
“So heads up, Nancy, don't get antsy, while I'm workin' on my tan”

What the hell happened?

Owl City Fans Deserve Better

We’re still here because we know what you’re capable of. But every time you release a new song, it’s like you’re spitting in our faces and saying, “You’ll take this Walmart brand Owl City and you’ll like it.”

We deserve better. Owl City deserves better. The guy who made Ocean Eyes and Ultraviolet still exists somewhere inside you. I don’t want to hear about your nostalgia for growing up in Minnesota… I want to hear music that makes me feel like I’m flying above it.

Until then, Adam, you’re not Owl City anymore. You’re just Adam Young, making music for adverts and waiting rooms.

Bring back the magic. Or let the dream die already.


Why Pressure Makes Magic

They say pressure makes diamonds. Tragedy breeds creativity. Artists create when life squeezes them… pain, longing, love lost, all fuel for something magical. Owl City’s early work was dreamy escapism, full of longing and wonder. It felt like Adam was building these sonic snow globes because reality wasn’t enough. Now? Reality is the music, and it’s just not that interesting.

If you’re not convinced, let’s imagine this:
What if My Chemical Romance started making songs about mowing their lawn or visiting their grandma? Would it be relatable? Maybe. Would it still be MCR? Absolutely not.

That’s Owl City now: technically good, painfully mundane

Why the Ship Sank: Self-Sabotage and Silence

Something broke after All Things Bright and Beautiful. You can feel it. The whimsy, the wonder.. it all started slipping away. Adam Young’s relationship with Owl City went from enchanted to embittered, and I think the pressure, the live band drama, and label constraints pushed him to a breaking point. He didn’t just drift away; he deliberately steered the ship into the rocks.

I genuinely believe Adam had a mental breakdown that he mostly kept private. The signs are all there. The sudden genre shifts, the hollow experimentation of Mobile Orchestra, the self referential boredom of Cinematic, it all reeks of an artist desperate to detach from his own creation. It’s like he resented Owl City, resented the expectations, and just wanted out.

There was probably an album planned between ATBAB and Mobile Orchestra that we’ll never hear. Trapped in label purgatory, never to see daylight. Rather than fight for it, Adam retreated. And instead of giving us new dreams, he started handing us diary entries and lifeless tunes.

Now, he pushes bland merch, and seems content cashing in on nostalgia while the magic quietly dies. It’s a slow, sad fade out orchestrated by the very person who used to make us believe in the extraordinary",1,1734601759.0,OWLCITY,0,0.67,False

""Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it went in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity."" — Paulo Coelho, *The Alchemist*

  
Hi everyone! My name is Štěpán, I’m Czech, and I’m 30 years old. Please be kind with my grammar, as I’m not a native speaker :)

I'll start by briefly telling my story. I have always been the more sensitive one among my peers, and that has stayed with me throughout my life. Anxiety followed me through my entire childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. My stepfather was a narcissistic aggressor who couldn't control his emotions, and my mother was not emotionally mature and was unable to show love toward her child. I escaped the situation in my mind and often dissociated, even as a child. I had problems at school and didn't have many friends, even though I am an extrovert. The fear of rejection has accompanied me throughout my life.

When I was 19 years old, my biological father contacted me for the first time, and I traveled to the USA to visit him for three months. During that time, I had my first panic attack. The panic attacks continued until one day I woke up, and everything was different. The world was different, and so was I. I felt like I was in a dream, but it was not a pleasant one.

I won't describe the course of my DPDR in detail, but I will mention that it lasted for nearly six years.



**My symptoms that I struggled with**:

* **Feeling of unreality** – disconnection from reality
* **People and familiar things seem... strange?**
* **Reduced proactivity**
* **Strange tension around all sides of my head**
* **Lights look unusual**
* **Sudden rushes of urgency**
* **Feeling like being in a dream**
* **Fear of serious illness – hypochondria**
* **Psychosomatic sensations** – pain in all vital organs
* **Body in autopilot mode** – the feeling of control over my body is gone
* **Existential questions, doubts, and spiritual black holes**
* **Questioning my own existence and the existence of everything around me**
* **Fear of death** – often feeling terrified of it
* **Poor short-term memory**
* **Insomnia** and fear of not being able to sleep
* **Panic attacks – panic disorder**
* **Mental blackouts followed by intense fear**
* **Fear of going insane**
* **I'm definitely going crazy (no, I’m not! 😅)**
* **Restless, scattered mind**
* **Constant monitoring of physical symptoms**
* **Fear of leaving my safe space** (bed, room, house)
* **Agoraphobia** – fear of open spaces
* **Inability to organize my thoughts**



**What is DPDR and why does it happen?**

Believe it or not, depersonalization is actually a very fascinating state! It’s an extremely common phenomenon. According to the latest studies, it is the third most common anxiety symptom (so always remember — you’re not alone! Someone else has definitely had every ugly, nonsensical thought that DP throws into your mind!). Almost everyone experiences a certain level of depersonalization at some point in their lives. It can be triggered by many different causes, the most common of which are traumatic experiences such as a car accident, the death of a loved one, a bad drug experience, or a panic attack. DP usually lasts during the trauma and for a short time afterward, but for some people, like me, the state can persist.

DPDR is a **defense mechanism of the body** that protects us from danger, meaning that during a traumatic situation, it tries to minimize emotional stress by ""cutting us off"" from reality. For most people, DP naturally fades away once the traumatic situation ends, but that’s not always the case. Some people are more prone to depression or anxiety, and DPDR is no different. During DPDR, people may become aware of the feeling that they are in a dreamlike state, separate from their former reality, which leads them to question, ""Wait, why do I feel like this... is something wrong with me?""

This unease generates even more anxiety and fear, which is now directed at the feelings caused by DP. As a result, DP does not fade away like it does for most people. Instead, through this cycle of ""fear of fear,"" a short episode of DPDR transforms into a real, lasting state of mind and consciousness. This process seems to be quite common among people who experience panic attacks, anxiety, or panic disorders. This is because panic attacks or prolonged feelings of anxiety trigger a ""life-threatening"" response, even though no real danger exists.

It's understandable that a person may be terrified of these feelings of unreality and even believe that they’re losing their mind — but in reality, that’s not happening at all. There are many causes, but they all have one thing in common: the affected person focuses on the sensations brought on by DP and tries to figure out why they feel this way, which in turn worsens the DP. It’s similar to having a catchy song stuck in your head. The more you try to get rid of it, the more you end up singing it to yourself, feeding the thought over and over.

There is no more fire or car crash (or, in the case of a panic attack, there was never any danger at all) that you can attribute the feelings of unreality to, so you start wondering, ""When will this end?"" The truth is, these very thoughts are what prolong DPDR. The feeling, which should last only minutes, can, when focused on, turn into a mental habit that lasts for hours, days, months, years, or more without any relief.

Interestingly, there hasn’t been much psychiatric research done on this condition. This is partly because it was difficult for so long to define what DPDR actually is, and also because, in the vast majority of cases, depersonalization is a **secondary symptom** caused by trauma, prolonged stress, etc. Once we address the roots of the trauma or change our lifestyle, depersonalization typically resolves on its own.

People often come to the conclusion that they must have gone crazy and that there’s no way out — *""I’m lost in this hell on Earth forever.""* They wonder, *""Why else would I be hit with this paralyzing fear out of nowhere?""* But, of course, they haven’t gone crazy. The body is simply doing its job, reacting to what it perceives as danger. This also explains why fear maintains itself. But since there’s no threat, you assume something is wrong with your mind. This creates even more fear, and since there’s no external threat, it turns inward. This can quickly spiral out of control into a full-blown panic attack (not to mention the formation of habitual DP thoughts).

One particularly frustrating aspect of DP is that fear and anxiety have nowhere to go and nothing to latch onto. As a result, the fear builds up more and more until it even spills over into philosophical thoughts that would normally inspire wonder in people without DPDR, like: *“Why am I here?”* or *“Who am I?”* The fear can’t find an external object to cling to, so it eventually turns inward, focusing on the individual. It attaches itself to thoughts that others might find interesting or take for granted. But for someone suffering from DPDR, these thoughts become absolutely self-destructive and cruel.

This all contributes to the person with DP being trapped in a cycle of **self-observation and analysis**. Every little twitch, itch, or movement becomes something to be afraid of. The person becomes **overly aware of their body and mind**, analyzing every sensation and movement so much that the automatic ease and natural flow of normal functioning diminish. These analytical thoughts can become so intense that they might feel like a ""barrier"" between the mind and body.

Living like this every day can be incredibly challenging. It drains you both intellectually and physically. And, of course, being in a weakened physical and mental state reduces your defenses even more, further creating negative mental habits.

# BUT EVERYTHING IS REVERSIBLE…

As you begin to recover, you’ll look back and think…

**“WHAT ON EARTH WAS I THINKING?!”**

  


**Change**

**At the start, let me mention one crucial fact that you need to accept — without it, you won’t be able to move forward.**

DP/DR is indeed a **transient and 100% treatable condition**, but no pill, special exercise, miracle herb, or single session with a psychologist will cure you. **The only person who can cure you is YOU**, and that requires **constant effort, discipline, patience, and hard work** — ideally alongside long-term therapy with a specialist (psychologist or psychotherapist). The return to ""normal"" may take weeks or even months, and this period will be an even greater test than the experience of DP/DR itself. This is because you will have to **break old habits and thought patterns** that got you into DP/DR in the first place.

# Exercise and Physical Activity

Sure, we all know about it. Movement is good for us and healthy, but the number of people who know this compared to those who actually exercise regularly is staggering. Just look at forums that specifically deal with DP/DR, where people from all over the world contribute, such as **Reddit** and **DPSELFHELP**, and you’ll quickly see that **exercise is often the most significant factor of relief** for people suffering from depersonalization.

When you add consistency to this, exercise can become a **hobby** — something associated with positive feelings and relief. It can even become a **ritual**, which is something profoundly important to lean on during recovery. No matter what activity you choose — **fitness, running, yoga, cycling, hiking** — you can’t go wrong. Any kind of physical activity will do.

**Mental and Mind Training**

Just as important as training the body is training the mind. In Eastern culture, it's much more common to proactively take care of one’s mental health, whereas in our culture, it’s often seen as a taboo topic that people deal with quietly and in private. When people hear ""meditation,"" many imagine a monk in an orange robe chanting ""OM."" In reality, it is an incredibly **precise and effective tool** that allows us to train our minds like a muscle.

Just like physical training, it requires **perseverance and discipline** to achieve results. The beginning can be very difficult, even without experiencing DP/DR, and with it, it becomes twice as challenging. No matter what method you choose — guided or unguided meditation, yoga, autogenic training, listening to meditative music, affirmations, prayers, etc. — you’ll face a **long and thorny road**. But if you endure and overcome this struggle, you will become **mentally stronger and more stable than ever before**.

I personally chose a combination of **meditation and yoga**, and it helped me tremendously. For meditation, I was greatly helped by Dean Sluyter’s book *Natural Meditation*. For yoga, YouTube tutorials are sufficient, but it’s far better to find a local instructor and attend your first class in person.

**Autogenic training** is also a very useful tool that I tried. You can learn more about it by searching for information online or watching tutorial videos available on various platforms.

# Dietary Supplements

Here is a list of all the supplements that have personally helped me and that I continue to take regularly.

* **Ashwagandha** – A great adaptogen.
* **Siberian Ginseng** – A great adaptogen.
* **Rhodiola Rosea** – A great adaptogen.
* **High-quality multivitamin and multimineral**.
* **Vitamins D3 + K + A** – I personally take 4000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily. It’s good to buy a combination of ADK to prevent vascular calcification, which can happen if you take only D3 on its own.
* **High-quality Omega-3 and Omega-6 complex** – Look for a high concentration of EPA and DHA fatty acids.
* **Ginkgo Biloba** – A great adaptogen.
* **CBD** – A legal and non-psychoactive component of cannabis. It can be taken as an extract or vaporized from hemp flowers, which are now available in vending machines or through many online stores.
* **High-quality probiotics** – Available in pharmacies. Look for products with the highest possible number of live cultures.
* **Herbal teas** – **Lemon balm**, **hemp**, **mint**, **red poppy**, **St. John's Wort** (do not combine with antidepressants or contraceptives), **chamomile**, and **hops**.

These supplements and natural remedies can provide support and relief as you work on your mental and physical well-being.

**Lifestyle Changes**

In addition to the methods described above, it’s also essential to **change your lifestyle**. In this section, I’ll list habits and activities that you should either **adopt or avoid**. Of course, not everything will suit everyone, but these habits helped me immensely on my journey.

# Sleep

This is probably the most important aspect to get in order. For me, and for many others on forums, a strict rule worked best: **Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day**, aiming for 8-9 hours of sleep. Quality sleep is essential for mental balance, and it directly affects the intensity of DP/DR symptoms.

# Caffeine

Unfortunately, caffeine is not an option — and I mean **not at all**. Caffeine increases anxiety, raises stress levels, and increases blood pressure — the complete opposite of what we’re trying to achieve. It also disrupts the **sleep cycle**, which, as mentioned earlier, is directly linked to the intensity of DP/DR symptoms.

# Nicotine

This habit has to go as well. No matter how you consume nicotine — cigarettes, nicotine pouches, vapes, patches, or HEETS — **you have to quit**. Nicotine increases heart rate, causes anxiety, and raises dopamine levels, desensitizing dopamine receptors. This makes it harder to feel joy from small, everyday accomplishments. I was a smoker myself and later a user of nicotine pouches (VELO, FOX, etc.), so I know how hard it can be. But quitting made a world of difference for me.

# Pornography

Watching pornography releases such a massive amount of dopamine (comparable to taking cocaine) that it triggers the **parasympathetic nervous system**, causing us to ""drool"" like Pavlov’s dog. It has the **same effect as nicotine** — it reduces our ability to enjoy small daily pleasures. You can learn more about the effects and benefits of quitting pornography on **NoFap forums**.

# Alcohol

While it’s not necessary to quit alcohol entirely, it’s a good idea to **limit it**. Some people experience temporary relief from DP/DR symptoms after drinking alcohol, which only proves that **DP/DR is a temporary state**. However, it’s not wise to escape your problems through alcohol. If you’re out with friends, don’t deprive yourself of a drink, but do so **in moderation**.

# THC (Marijuana)

This is a definite **no-go**. For a large portion of people with DP/DR, marijuana with high THC content was actually the **trigger** for their condition. The paradox is that the second most abundant compound in cannabis is **CBD**, which can actually relieve anxiety and has beneficial effects on the body. So while THC is risky, **CBD** can be a helpful ally.

# The Wim Hof Method

This is a **fantastic tool** for energizing both the body and the mind. It combines **breathing techniques, cold exposure, and mindset training**, which can help you feel more grounded and in control. This method is praised by people around the world for its positive effects on anxiety, immunity, and mental well-being.

# Cold Showers / Sauna

Both **cold exposure and sauna sessions** are amazing ways to boost your immunity and calm the mind. Alternating between hot and cold treatments stimulates the nervous system, promotes resilience, and supports overall mental health.

# Sweets and Added Sugar

Try to **limit sugar consumption** as much as possible. Eating sugar and sweet treats causes sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, leading to mental imbalance and increased **anxiety and hypersensitivity to stress**. A balanced diet will make you feel much more grounded and stable.

# Walks / Outdoor Activities

I know how hard it is to leave the **safety of your home or bed**, but your body and mind need **fresh air**. Whether it’s taking walks, spending time in nature, or **socializing with friends and family**, make an effort to participate as much as you can. Being outdoors helps rewire your mind and body in a positive way.

# Don’t Think About DP/DR

This is perhaps the most challenging but also the **most effective strategy**. Even if you’re feeling the sensations of DP/DR, **don’t feed them with your fear**. Acknowledge that you feel this way, but do not waste your precious energy on it. I know it’s easier said than done, but with time and practice, it becomes an **automatic response** to the different sensations that DP/DR throws at you.

The goal is to build a life with strong, healthy habits that **support mental clarity and physical well-being**. Over time, these habits replace the old, harmful patterns that sustained DP/DR. Every little step forward counts, even if it feels slow. Stick with it, and you’ll get there.



**Back to ""Normal""**

You might think that even after you recover, you’ll slip back into a DP/DR episode during any difficult or stressful situation. But the truth is, **you will never go back**, and I’ll explain why.

As I mentioned earlier, DP/DR is a **pattern of thoughts and habits**. What you’re working toward — or hopefully already working on — is **building healthy habits and ways of thinking** that will replace the unhealthy ones that got you stuck in the DP/DR cycle. I’ll explain this using the following example:

Let’s say you’ve been a **smoker for 10 years** and decided to quit because you know it’s bad for you. You didn’t quit overnight, but instead gradually reduced the number of cigarettes you smoked each day. This process took one or two months, but eventually, you **stopped associating smoking with coffee breaks or an evening glass of wine**. You learned to ignore the craving every time you saw someone else smoking. It took effort and willpower, but you **successfully replaced old habits with healthier ones**.

Now, fast forward to three years later. You’re at a friend’s birthday party, and they offer you a cigarette. Will you take it? Sure, why not? So you light it up, but does that mean you’re suddenly **addicted to smoking again**? Of course not. The **positive habits** you built over time are stronger than the old smoking habit. You might feel a small craving for a cigarette the next day, but that’s okay because you’ve already **learned how to handle it**.

# The Same Applies to DP/DR

After you recover from DP/DR, it’s possible that during **stressful life events**, you’ll experience DP/DR-like sensations. This happens to **every healthy person**, not just people who’ve had DP/DR. But the key difference is that this time, you’ll **recognize it for what it is**. You won’t interpret it as a threat, and you’ll understand **why you feel that way**.

It’s also important to remember that **you won’t get rid of DP/DR overnight**. There’s no magical cure because DP/DR is a natural **defense mechanism** of the body. **Getting out of it requires a gradual shift in habits**, similar to quitting smoking or learning to be more positive overall. You need to think of recovery as a process that takes **months, not days**.

# Recovery is Not a Straight Line

Healing is not like walking a straight path from ""bad habits"" to ""good habits."" It’s more like **skiing down an ungroomed slope**. Sometimes you’ll make a wrong turn and have to backtrack. Other times, you’ll get stuck in deep snow and won’t be able to move forward. But then there are moments when you’ll catch yourself **gliding down effortlessly**, feeling free and in control.

The important thing to remember is that **every move, no matter how difficult, is part of your progress toward recovery**. Even when the descent is tough, every step you take is **still forward movement**. It might feel like you’re not making progress, but if you zoom out and see the bigger picture, you’ll realize you’re constantly moving **closer to the goal — full recovery**.



**The Last Glimpses of DP/DR**

The last time I felt any trace of DP/DR was when I was **25 years old**. I didn’t realize right away that it was gone. It only became clear **over time**, when I looked back and noticed that I actually felt **happy**.

If you’ve made it this far, **congratulations!** I know this post is long, and honestly, just thinking about its length makes me feel a bit sick 😅.

If you’d like some **advice or just want to chat**, feel free to send me a DM.

I got irrationally angry about how bored I was!!! She has nothing interesting to say, doesn't really care about acting or movies and the only time she starts remotely sounding alive is when she talks about food. She has the perfect attitude for a model, no joie de vivre, just looks and height. And I feel like her personality plays a big role in how Rory has developed as a character. It might not be intentional but every character merges with the actor over time, especially the ones who have most screen time. Lauren and Lorelai are so much alike, Scott has his own coffee brand, I think and Rory really is this kind of emotionless nothing burger whose only goal in life is to cover the life that was molded by someone else, her mother. I am not hating on the actress (or maybe I am), but I just hate the fact that they didn't choose someone who really loves acting and can give a character depth and not just looks.

In the course of the series you can really see how much she needs a dominant counter part: Lorelai, Paris, Logan and I think our frustration with Rory comes from Alexis not being able or not willing to commit to the role and it seems like she is really just doing her job, there's no passion, no energy... It works fine because of the dynamic with the other characters, but it more or less falls apart when she becomes and adult. I think she has had not enough talent and it's not because she was young and inexperienced, Liza as Paris is so much better.

I am kinda torn because i really love this series, but I can't shake the feeling that her acting felt so disengaged, superficial and passive that it hurt the development of Rory. Nor can I stop thinking about how her behavior might have led to plot decisions for Rory, for example her complete inner disintegration after the harsh rejection by asshole Mitchum and the way she embraced Logan's lifestyle before and even after that.

During an interview she talked about how she had to audition or come back about six times and she got the role once she became a little more sassy and said something along the lines like how many times will I have to come back, huh. I feel like they wanted to cast her because she is so pretty but were hoping for some signs of idk...personality...? I don't want to be mean and I know that a lot of people deal with stuff that makes them maybe shy and reserved, but you don't have to pour that into a character, because that is the magic of acting, you gotta be someone else and pretend and you are creative with it and thoughtful. 

Part of my frustration with her and the reason why those topics are discussed as much in here is exactly that, there is never a becoming of her, she will always only be the daughter of Lorelai Gilmore and maybe, in the end Alexis' portrayal of Rory was perfect in that way.",0,1734601392.0,GilmoreGirls,3,0.48,False

Kasi I am confident na wala akong nakikitang mali sa nagagawa ko lately. I consulted men and women’s opinion, single, married, long term and short term bf/gf, and even the broken ones. They all said the same thing. Which is di mo pa naiintindihan yung adulting phase na I am in right now. Di mo naccomprehend na di lang sating dalawa umiikot yung buhay ko. 
 
Bukod sa trabaho, may acads akong iniintindi (you saw that when you came here) na kahit may derma appointment ako I needed to attend meeting, as a representative of the batch I have responsibilities sa org as well, as a president I have to be the front guy of the whole Batch Delta  
(that includes but it is not limited to: bidding processes, inquiry, military training, and flying school canvassing and as a liaison), having a headache-causing family where I keep on pulling strings together because of Mom, Dad, my Ate, and my kuya are nag-aaway and acting like they are not an adult partida bunso ako at napaka-hirap maging alkansya at magkaroon ng old-Filipino DDS na parents, and the biggest part of it all, my health, my SGPT is 135 (normal is 41) where I experience fatigue and extreme weakness. Sobrang nanlalambot ako at nanghihina bukod dun, I experience flare ups and you can definitely see it sa balat ko that I have a chronic skin condition. But despite it all, I tried to update you with all the power I can ever give. I even asked you out for a date during my day off when I could’ve been resting and enjoying myself (hindi ito sumbat I just wanted to bring this up because you mentioned that I don’t appreciate your efforts, so I want to bring up my efforts as well just in case na di mo napapansin, heads up lang). 
 
Yes, I should be accountable for not replying to your messages but that DOES NOT MEAN that I am ignoring you, it's just my world has become bigger now, and I have so many responsibilities as an independent student pilot who wants to change his fate by carrying his own weight. 
 
 
I wouldn't say I liked your reaction when I mentioned that I could not handle your overthinking. You know how patient and understanding I am. Kinaya ko ngang minamaltrato ako ng magulang ko at pag-cheatan ng ex habang working student ako eh. But that time when I said that I could not handle your overthinking you erupted. I also did mention that I am not your psychiatrist. But since you mean so much to me, I can understand you. Pero di ko kinakaya. I hope you know that we should be responsible for our traumas. I have traumas as well and yes I will not deny that I sometimes have triggers as well but I have the awareness that I am too much sometimes. But we can work this thing together, I guess. 
 
And now, I am going to bring this hard-to-swallow pill that I am thinking about lately. And the reason that made me reconsider this relationship.  
 
You cursed me. 
 
Without even consulting me and asking me first. You raged out and cursed me without hesitation, Without me even knowing the situation where you right away blocked me after saying those words to me. If only you knew how it feels like reading those words in my notifications when it popped out of my smart watch while I am at work. I even sold that watch because of the psychological warfare it did to me because I am so scared of reading those words again. My reaction was, that I was hurting not by the fact that you raged but for the sole reason of cursing me which even my immature parents and cheater exes never EVER did to me. That is what I noticed in you as well, whenever you feel your emotions, you don’t think properly and resort to raising your voice and making your point clear rather than de-escalating the situation and continuing to talk calmly. I noticed that sa Molito, where we are talking about our different views in our relationship. And you, for so many times, initiated to walk out from me. I indirectly tried to stop you from doing that because I seem that it is childish and very unbecoming not to accept other people, especially your partner’s views when it comes to perspective. When you walked out from me, two random teenage women approached me if I was okay, I don't know but I guess they heard you and were concerned about me because of what you were doing to me during that time and you gained the courage to walk out from me. That is how loud your voice was. 
 
I understand that you consulted your friends or people that you know about those things that we discussed beforehand. But I want you to know that I do not do the same thing, why? Every time that I ask people, especially those who I am close with, regarding situations that are alarming to our relationship and opinions about us, THEY TEND TO HAVE CONFIRMATION BIAS, simply because they are close with you, and you will unconsciously say your side, and it is human nature to have that as well. Also, I am going to bring my researcher side here, what you did is a phenomenological study but only to limited people. Whereas, A phenomenological study explores what people experience and focuses on their experience of a phenomenon (Duquesne University, 2023). Meaning, that what you asked differs from person to person because it is their experience. It will never be the same experience as ours, even if it's a coincidence, it's better to be struck by lightning.  
 
 But since you insisted, I tried asking and looking for answers as well. Objectively. 
 
 Now, when it comes to my updates, as far as what I can back read, I did my best to update you even during my 15-minute break when I should’ve grabbed a coffee, went to the restroom to pee, grabbed myself a chocolate, or even have a time for myself. But what I did was to update you, and yes it might sound that I am nanunumbat but I do not care about what you might think of me anymore since you undoubtedly question my efforts and not seeing the whole picture of what I am doing. Despite all of it, you looked for a single word “goodnight” or “good luck.” Which, I am sincerely sorry and always know that I never and will never mean to ignore you. But trust me, if I were in your shoes, I would feel hurt as well, I totally get where you are coming from. But as I mentioned earlier, you knew what was happening to me. And yes, you should not just suck it all up but I am just asking for understanding but I can feel as well that I am too much. 
 
As I have mentioned earlier, my responsibilities in life are too heavy to the point that I am not having the time to take care of myself. I am in my early 20s and I am in the transition of graduating and adulting phase of my life to be honest I realized na mahirap pala talaga and I never wished to be in this situation. And yes, it is never my intention to ignore you but I hope you know that if I can, I would do everything without you even asking for it. I am just asking you to understand the situation I am in right now. But yeah, you should not carry the burden I am carrying and you are not obliged to understand me. But if you still cannot comprehend the situation I am in, I am sorry but I cannot continue this relationship because it is mentally draining to see messages that is negative and manunuyo pa ako eh pagod na pagod ka na nga sa trabaho kasi tbh sorry for the word, its nakakaputangina. As much as I wanted to cater to your needs, my human body cannot plus the fact that I am not healthy right now. 
 
At this point, where I explained to you a glimpse of what is happening to me right now. If you still cannot understand the situation where I am in right now and will still continue to insist on your feelings. As much as that is important to me as well. I am sorry but I am stepping out. “

✨ “Listening to my body is the hardest but most rewarding job I’ve ever had. Today, my body said, ‘Let’s not.’ And I honored that. ✨

Being chronically ill while balancing my career as a corporate social media maven is no small feat. People say, ‘Ashley, how do you do it all?’ And the answer is simple: I don’t. I don’t clean. I don’t cook. I don’t even get dressed most days. I refuse to burn out in the name of capitalism when my body is BEGGING me to rest.

Today, I prioritized my healing journey by focusing on gentle, nourishing activities that respected my energy levels:

🌿 Gentle Movement: I walked from my bed to the kitchen and back. Twice. It’s all about tuning in to what your body can handle.

🥣 Nourishing Meals: I had my go-to healing broth. (Okay, fine, it was a chai latte with collagen powder, but it felt like soup.)

💻 Work Hustle: Opened my laptop, stared at my empty calendar, and then closed it. Corporate grind? Checked off for the day.

🛌 Radical Rest: Spent two hours in bed recharging my nervous system with a guided meditation for ‘energetic abundance.’ (I fell asleep halfway through, which means it’s working.)

🌸 Body Respect: Wrapped myself in a weighted blanket and did a mindful breathing exercise… which is honestly a full-body workout if you think about it.


I’ve also been leaning into my holistic remedies for support. Today’s lineup included:


🧪 A drop of oregano oil on my wrists to ward off bad vibes. (Also my ankles because energy comes from the ground up!)

💎 wrapping amethyst crystals over my belly for womb healing.

💡 Infrared light therapy aimed directly at my face to restore my cellular alignment.

🌙 Journaling about my luteal phase (did you know this is the creativity phase of your cycle??!)

I’m so proud of myself for showing up for my body and creating a healing, restful environment where I can THRIVE. Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing LESS and doing it GENTLY.

✨ Remember, babes, the key to balance and alignment is listening to your body and giving it what it really needs. Rest, hydration, gentle movement—these are the true markers of success. I’ll be back to share more about my journey soon, but for now, I’m off to the second bath of the day. 🛁

1hhp3lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanPitBulls/comments/1hhp3lw/i_was_a_pitbull_defender_but_this_is_over_attacks/,"I was a pitbull defender, but this is over (attacks on dogs, May 2023/December 2024, south of France)","Back in the early 2000's I was convinced that bad owners were responsible for pitbulls/American staff attacks. Then I worked as a vet tech and I saw them weekly, most of these dogs were well-behaved and socialized.
I adopted an American staff x rottweiler who lived 13 years without any aggression towards humans or pets. So my opinion hadn't changed, bad owners were responsible.

But the last couple years I witnessed two violent pitbull attacks on other dogs and I heard many stories, I'm not so sure now.

The first one last year in May. I have two hounds, very shy but dog friendly. One day I was walking them when an unleashed huge pitbull rushed towards us, barking and growling. The owner said to me that it was playing (it was NOT). I managed to stay calm and get away.

Three days later, my neighbor who owns a bull terrier had to faced the same dog. This time, the pitbull, along with a 5 month old American staff, threw themselves on the bull terrier, catching him by the throat and shaking him like a ragdoll. I was going to work, by chance I didn't have my dogs with me. 

For 15 awfully long minutes, the bull terrier's owner, two passers-by and I tried everything to get them to let go : punching, pulling by the legs, choking them by their collar, hot coffee, water hose, etc. Someone even tried to put a finger up the pit bull's ass. I had a leash in my car and I was able to tie the younger one, then passed the leash through a gate and we pulled with another person, as if on a pulley. The puppy was now out of the picture but the pitbull was still tearing bits off the bull terrier.

At some point the two dogs, the terrier's owner and myself all ended up on the ground and the pitbull loosened its bite. Someone picked up the bleeding bull terrier and throw him over the next fence. The pitbull's owner who did fucking nothing but scream, took his dog and fled the scene.

It took 122 stitches to save the dog. He had a punctured eye, his neck was in pieces, he lost an ear, bites all over the throat and two front legs. Fortunately, he is massive with a muscular neck and it saved his life. If it had been one of my two slender dogs, they would be killed. 
The owner had to undergo surgeries for a foot and a hand. I myself didn't suffer much injuries, some torn nails, road burns and bruises. It was terrifying and I'm still traumatized.

The bull terrier took months to recover, infections, cracking stitches, and psychologically, he was having nightmares, barking and screaming many times a night. He is a sweet boy and he gets along very well with my dogs, whom he trusts.

Last week, something similar happened when I was walking my hounds with an old lady and her Jack Russell. A young red nose I know since it's a puppy, smelled my dogs and came running to say hello (unleashed of course, the owner wasn't even in sight). But without any provocation, threw itself on the Jack Russell, grabbed him by the neck and shook him violently. I screamed and the pitbull let the other dog go. It's a good thing the little dog had a thick winter coat, because it was cold. He had a broken nail and no other injury.

I knew this pitbull, it's always been very friendly with my dogs and I don't understand what happened in its head which lead it to attack unprovoked. It's really frightening I can't trust it anymore around me and my pets.

More than half of the dog's owner I know have similar stories to share, always pitbull/American staff/bully breeds. Some have lost a little dog fatally injured during the attack.",4,1734599967.0,BanPitBulls,0,1.0,False

In photos, everything looks spectacular, and some people who had been there told me it was a very beautiful place. I’ve just spent 9 days there (6 days on the main island, São Tomé, and 3 days on the smaller island, Príncipe).

**What nobody tells you:**

* **In this country, people are not friendly.** They are very reserved. It's impossible to make local friends, even if you speak their language (Portuguese). They don't like white people; they always give you unpleasant looks and seem annoyed when you try to talk to them. It’s not just my impression. The few travelers I met all said the same thing: “Yeah... they’re not expressive... they’re not particularly nice... they never smile... they tried to rip me off.” Everyone shares the same opinion. Especially **on Príncipe Island, where people were very unpleasant.** The only place where I found a bit of friendliness was in the country’s capital (São Tomé, in the city—not in the villages or communities/comunidades).
* **They see you as a walking ATM;** they only want money from you. Renting a car in São Tomé costs around €50 per day for a tourist (after talking to many people, I managed to get one for €45 per day, and it was an old car). In Príncipe, I didn’t rent anything because they were asking for €120 per day. I should mention that their average monthly salary is around €100, so they’re asking you to pay for a car in one day what they earn in a month.
* The hotels are the same. They charge you €60 for a room, which is often just a hut, sometimes without water or electricity. **The prices are exorbitant.** I stayed in 8 hotels, and in all of them, it was the same: lack of water, lack of electricity, spiders... and they still charged me around €60, even during the low season. I was the only guest in all the hotels, yet they were unhelpful. They are the least welcoming people I have ever met, and I’ve visited 60 countries.
* A CAPSULE coffee anywhere cost me €3—more expensive than in Europe. They are supposed to have the best coffee in the world. They always give you capsule coffee though.
* On average, I spent €120 per day on hotels, food, and a car. No luxuries—just very basic hotels, an old car, and meals of rice with fish and water.
* The country is beautiful, though very poor. It is not unsafe, but **it is incredibly overrated** considering the value for money. For that amount of money, you could go to Southeast Asia, have a much better experience, be treated better, and spend five times less.

And yet, I keep gravitating towards their cafes just for the overall ""cafe"" experience and imo no other cafe (at least in Hyderabad), comes close to the ambiance. I love the whiff of coffee, the sounds from the coffee grinder, cups clanking, spoons clinking, the earthy decor, and warm lights - it has a soothing affect and puts me in a good mood all the time. I end up going there just to have a Cortado or Espresso Machiatto with a blonde roast if they have it, sit in one corner and chill.

My Story and What Finally Helped,"Snoring is something most of us either do or live with. But when I started waking up with a **sore throat every morning**, I knew something wasn’t right. At first, I didn’t connect the dots—I thought maybe I was breathing through my mouth at night or just catching a series of colds. But as it turned out, my snoring was the real culprit.

After some trial and error, I came across the **ZQuiet mouthpiece**. I’ll get to that later, but first, let’s talk about how snoring and sore throats are connected and what I learned along the way.

# How Snoring Can Cause a Sore Throat

It might sound odd, but snoring can absolutely lead to a sore throat. Here’s why:

1. **Dry air in your throat and mouth** – When you snore, you’re often breathing through your mouth instead of your nose. This dries out the soft tissues in your throat, leading to irritation and soreness by morning.
2. **Vibrations of the soft tissues** – Snoring happens when your throat tissues vibrate as you breathe. These constant vibrations can irritate the lining of your throat, leaving it inflamed and tender.
3. **Blocked airflow** – When snoring happens due to your airway partially closing, your body works harder to pull in air, which can strain your throat even more.

For me, waking up with a scratchy, dry throat became a daily occurrence. I’d down water as soon as I got up, but the discomfort lingered. It wasn’t until I noticed a pattern (my partner pointing out my snoring, feeling exhausted, and the sore throat) that I realized what was happening.

# The Bigger Problems Snoring Can Cause

At first, I brushed snoring off as nothing more than an annoying habit. I didn’t think it could cause health issues beyond bothering the person next to me. But as I started researching, I realized snoring can be a sign of bigger problems:

* **Poor sleep quality:** Snoring disrupts your sleep cycles, leaving you feeling tired, foggy, and unmotivated the next day.
* **Fatigue and brain fog:** I used to struggle to get through my mornings without three cups of coffee because my body wasn’t recharging overnight.
* **Higher risk of sleep apnea:** While not all snoring is tied to sleep apnea, consistent loud snoring could indicate airway issues, which can harm your health long term.
* **Relationship strain:** I’m not kidding when I say my partner was one night away from moving permanently to the guest room.

It’s worth noting that snoring itself isn’t always a big deal—lots of people snore. But when it’s **affecting your throat, energy, or relationships**, it’s probably time to address it.

# What Finally Helped: The ZQuiet Mouthpiece

By the time I decided to try something, I’d already tested a laundry list of “solutions” that didn’t work for me—nasal strips, throat sprays, different pillows. Nothing stopped the snoring, and the sore throats persisted.

That’s when I read about **mandibular advancement devices** (MADs). These are mouthpieces designed to move your jaw slightly forward to keep your airway open. It sounded logical, so I looked into the options and came across the **ZQuiet mouthpiece**.

What makes ZQuiet different?

1. **Ready-to-use** – There’s no boiling or molding involved. You just pop it in your mouth, and it’s good to go.
2. **Comfortable design** – It’s made from soft, flexible material that lets you move your jaw naturally. You can even breathe through your mouth, which is a lifesaver for people like me who can’t always breathe well through their nose at night.
3. **Clinically proven and FDA-cleared** – Knowing it was a legit product gave me confidence to try it.

The first night, it felt a little weird, but I woke up with no sore throat for the first time in weeks. The best part? My partner said I barely snored. By night three, I was used to wearing it, and I started feeling more energized in the mornings.

# What I Learned About Snoring Solutions

If you’re looking into snoring fixes, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Not all snoring solutions target the root cause.** Nasal strips and sprays didn’t work for me because my issue wasn’t congestion—it was my throat collapsing as I slept.
* **Comfort matters.** Some mouthguards force your teeth into a clenched position, which can be painful. The **ZQuiet mouthpiece** allows natural jaw movement, so you’re not locked in place.
* **Give it time.** The first night or two might feel strange, but most people adjust quickly.

Here’s the second link I used when researching more about it: [**Learn more about ZQuiet here**](https://getzquiet.io/offer-07/?lpid=1829&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=658&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=658&device_type=&country_name=&uid=1829&oid=658&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/StoppedSnoring)

# Final Thoughts: Don’t Ignore Snoring

If you’re waking up with a sore throat and suspect it’s tied to snoring, you’re not alone. For me, snoring was more than just an annoyance—it was affecting my sleep, my mornings, and even my partner. Using a simple device like the **ZQuiet mouth guard** changed that for me, and I’m finally waking up feeling refreshed and pain-free.

I’m curious—has anyone else here dealt with snoring and morning sore throats? What solutions have worked for you? Let’s share tips because I know how frustrating this can be!",1,1734599168.0,StoppedSnoring,0,1.0,False

Here’s what I’ve learned about keeping your teeth bright after using Laughland.

# The Laughland Whitening Routine

Laughland’s six-day program is designed to deliver noticeable results quickly. After completing the initial cycle, the key is to prevent new stains while maintaining your newly whitened smile.

Most people find that a **touch-up session every 2–3 months** is enough to keep their teeth looking great. However, your maintenance schedule might vary depending on factors like diet and oral hygiene habits.

# Factors That Affect Maintenance Frequency

1. **Diet**: If you drink coffee, tea, or red wine frequently, you might need to whiten more often.
2. **Smoking**: Tobacco stains are tough to prevent and may require more frequent touch-ups.
3. **Oral Hygiene**: Brushing and flossing regularly can help extend the time between whitening sessions.
4. **Natural Tooth Color**: Some people’s teeth naturally stain more easily, requiring additional maintenance.

# My Maintenance Routine with Laughland

After completing my first Laughland cycle, I followed these steps to maintain my results:

* Brushed with a whitening toothpaste twice daily.
* Used a straw for staining beverages to limit contact with my teeth.
* Scheduled a touch-up session every three months.

This routine has kept my teeth bright without over-whitening or causing sensitivity.

# Why Laughland Is Ideal for Maintenance

Laughland’s **dentist-formulated gel** is gentle enough for regular use, making it perfect for touch-ups. The LED mouthpiece also ensures even whitening, so your smile looks natural—not overdone.

Using a whitening kit like **Laughland Teeth Whitening** every few months is an easy and effective way to maintain your smile. Have you found a routine that works for you? Share your tips in the comments—I’d love to hear them!",1,1734598870.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

For my Frenchpress i use the same ratio as for the switch (1:14) grind relatively fine put in boiling water and wait 10min. 
After brew I add a bit water 

For the switch I use tetsus god recipe where you cool down your water in the process. 
After the brew I also add a bit water 


But the coffee from the FP tastes way better you can taste different notes whereas the switch coffee only tastes like strong coffee. 

What could be the issue. 

Have to say in tetsus video he says if it drips longer than 3 minutes you should cut it off whereas my coffee only drips a bit at 2:40 cut this be the issue should I grind finer ?",2,1734598860.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

(F26, M26)","It all started when a guy texted me on Instagram and flirted with me. Since I’m single and not looking for a relationship, I flirted back, and we ended up having a long conversation over text—almost the entire night. This continued for the next two days, and eventually, he asked me to meet him since he lived nearby. I got the same vibe from him, so I agreed. 

We met for dinner, had a few drinks, danced a lot, and really connected. He had a similar vibe to mine and loved dancing, which I found appealing. After the club, we went for a ride and roamed around until late at night, around 3 a.m. At one point, he asked if we could go to his flat. I didn’t feel any creepy vibes from him, so I agreed. At his flat, we talked, listened to music, and eventually decided to sleep since he had work from home the next day. 

While sleeping, he hugged me, and due to the moment’s heat, we kissed. Before the kiss, I told him that I had never done hookups or friends-with-benefits (FWB) and wasn’t looking for anything casual. He respected that and said it wasn’t an issue. After the kiss, we slept. The next morning, he let me rest, brought me breakfast and coffee, and made me feel comfortable. The whole day felt romantic—he kissed me, made me laugh, and showed a lot of affection. I felt slightly attracted to him but didn’t let it show. 

For the next two days, he kept texting me, saying he missed me. I didn’t want to show much interest because, based on my past experiences, things tend to end badly when I do. However, he was persistent and asked to meet again. He even planned a small, cozy date on his balcony, which was cold and romantic. That night, after a lot of heated moments, we ended up being intimate—not once, but four times. He made it clear that he’d never used protection before, but he respected my boundaries and agreed to use it. 

Later that night, while we were lying down, he said he wanted to tell me something. He admitted that before meeting me, he was in an FWB situation with a 23-year-old girl for three months. He said she left town two days before we met, and he wanted to end things with her. However, she kept calling and texting him, crying, and threatening to harm herself, so he felt stuck. I told him to explain things to her and end it gently, considering their age gap and lack of a future together. 

We didn’t sleep that night. By morning, we went for a sunrise ride, covering 20 km, even though he had office work later. When we returned, we were intimate again, and he dropped me home. 

After coming home, I started feeling conflicted. I didn’t want to be the reason someone else got hurt, so I avoided him for two days. During this time, he texted me, asking if I was on a date because I wasn’t replying. After two days, I texted back, saying I was busy, and we ended up meeting again. 

That night, he confessed that the girl had returned to town and was calling him repeatedly. I told him to talk to her. He then told me how easily he gets attached to people within 15–20 days and described himself as possessive. He was a bit aggressive during our intimate moments, but he made adjustments because I said I didn’t like it rough. He also said he found himself getting aroused with me more easily than ever before, even with just a kiss. I was overthinking about the other girl and whether he might be a “player,” but he denied it, saying he dates only one person at a time. 

Even though I tried not to, we kissed again. I told him I wouldn’t be intimate with him and that this would be our last meeting because I didn’t want to continue. In the morning, he confessed that he had picked the girl up when she arrived in town at 3 a.m. This made me angry, and I sarcastically thanked him for giving me more reasons not to meet him again. He said he couldn’t deny her because it had been three months and admitted he might have feelings for her. 

I asked if he was using me as a rebound, but he denied it. I packed my things, told him this was our last meeting, and asked him to drop me home. On the way, he asked if I wanted to say anything. I said no and reminded him I had already said everything. When he dropped me off, I said goodbye and wished him luck. He asked me not to block him, and I haven’t, but now I’m overthinking everything.

1hhok6f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhok6f,Pokemon: Too Many Types Nuzlocke Update - The Primeval Stench,"Today’s episode of Too Many Types takes us to  Dewport. After getting back the Devon Parts and rescuing Peeko from Team Aqua, the President of Devon Corporation gave us the task of sending a letter to Steven Stone in Dewport AND delivering the Devon Parts to Captain Stern in Slateport. 

We run back to Briney’s shack outside the Petalburg Woods and have him take us to Dewport, where upon arrival we find the next Gym, Brawly the Stinky-Type Gym Leader. But before we can go to him, we must first get to Steven and give him his lumpy letter. We picked up the Old Rod and a Lantern, caught Axis the Klink and Masami the Magikarp, and fought our way through the caverns and are rewarded with a TM for Steel Wing.

One grinding session later, we are all level 17 and are ready to challenge Brawly. Or so we thought, because after 1-shotting his Mankey with a Teddy Tumble from Scout the Sentret, Brawly was absolutely CREAMING us with his Sawk. This man must’ve taken some Dire Hits before this fight because he was getting crits off like CRAZY.

I switch out to Twine the Cottonee so we could Paralyze him with a Warm Hug. Realizing that both Mega Drain and Fairy Wind were doing nothing to him, I switch back out to Scout to get better damage in. After using a Super Potion, I realized this was going to be a never ending healing session at this point. So I made the tough decision to sacrifice Scout to heal Twine and get as much chip damage as possible, and as Scout tumbled his last teddy, he was killed by a Critical-hit Tackle.

I followed up with Pinto the Bayleef who landed a Critical-hit Lima Lash, but then Brawly pulled out a Super Potion before she could finish him off. After healing Pinto and boosting her speed with some morning coffee, I had her set up Reflect to dull the kicks and crits. After wearing down Sawk with Razor Leaves, Brawly pulled out ANOTHER super potion and followed up with 4 BACK-TO-BACK CRITICAL-HIT DOUBLE KICKS. 

Even with resistance and Reflect up I realized Pinto was in trouble, so I send in Pokey the Anorith to hit Sawk with a SE Metal Claw and was immediately put on his last legs with yet another Critical-hit Double Kick. I switched him out for Vulva the Vulpix hoping that the end-turn damage of Fire Spin would get him, but after getting good damage in she was one-shot and killed before the residual damage could finish Sawk off. I sent in Wubbzy the Azurill who he survived a SE Tackle and finished Sawk off with Bubblebeam.

Brawly was about to send in Machop but looking through my team, none of my Pokémon  were in shape to keep going. I had to make another hard decision to sacrifice one of my Pokemon to heal Pinto if I want to survive. I went with Twine the Cottonee, hoping that if he DID survive, he’d be able to get health back with Mega Drain. Luckily he DID mage to survive, letting me heal Pinto with a Potion and heal Twine with a Critical-hit Mega Drain… but not enough to survive a Critical-hit Karate Chop in response.

Pinto kills Machop and finally we are DONE, but at a heavy cost.

I put Vulva, Scout, and Twine in the box and brought out Masami the Magikarp, Axis the Klink, and Krabitha the Krabby, trained them up, and made our way to Slateport. Where after delivering the Devon Parts, failing the Battle Tent, and scaring off Team Aqua, we head off to Mauville and go train up some more. Wubbzy evolved into Mariel and then Azumarill like a level later, and Masami evolved into Gyarados. After exhausting all available trainers in the area and catching Gloves the Aipom, we finished up with our training and made it to Wattson, the Prime-Type Gym Leader.

Shockingly, he was easily the easiest Gym Leader yet.
Pinto set up Barrier and beat his Portion with Lima Lash, and Wattson followed up by sending out his problem Pokemon of the day, Whimsicott… I had a Cottonee once… 😔

With his Whimsicott repeatedly boosting with Growth and spamming Prime Sub, it could’ve swept our whole team. Wubbzy the Azumarill  got it into the red but was hit with a Critical-hit Teddy Tumble and was left at 8HP, so I swapped him out back to Pinto, letting me set back up Reflect while Wattson started popping Super Potions. After getting left at 3HP, I realized Whimsicott is becoming too strong and decided to cut it down a size with Masami’s Intimidate and had Pokey finish it off with a Critical-hit Metal Claw.

Krabitha was left in the red from his Pikachu’s two Shock Waves by the time she killed it with Vice Grip, Axis two-shot his Rotom with Prime Sub and that was that. We had beaten Wattson.

Now we can use the Hammer to smash rocks away.

1hhojgb,https://i.redd.it/hzavo6ioor7e1.jpeg,New Series: YOU ARE THE VOICE OF THE WORLD - Challenge 5,"WELCOME TO MY NEW CHALLENGE SERIES!!!

Here in this series I shall be posting about various people that I either know (through DMs) or have made up and their personality traits as well as their desires will be given in the post and you guys will be tasked with interpreting their will, nature and desires to give them a new body, a new race, a new beginning, their own Unique Skills and their Ultimate versions. Simple enough right?

Well then let's see if you shall be generous to the contenders like the World was to Rimuru, Hinata, Masayuki etc. or will you be cruel and capricious giving them weak powers and leading them down a path of hardship and suffering.

The main reason for this challenge series is to help people who love all sorts of Anime, Mangas, Manhwa, Shows, Movies and other fictional works and have always wondered what it would be like to be Isekai'd to those worlds and how they would interact with it and of course the Most important part of it all the Power Systems of these worlds, more precisely worlds whose power systems are personality based or rely heavily upon the nature, experiences and behaviors of an
Individual as well as
individual as well as their personality traits and cognitive abilities to give them unique and special powers and abilities. In that regard Tensura is one of the best as it allows for people to think about their own Unique and Ultimate Skills born from their personality, will, and desires to create a power that is truly their own and perfect for them and is a literal impression of their Mind upon reality. More often than not this desire to understand one's own nature and the fascination with such things results in creative pursuits such as writing, drawing, fanfics, and creating OCs, as such I wish to help everyone find a way to not only see what they think of themselves and what skills they think they will have but what others after analyzing their personality think they will have.


Which is why for today’s challenge we have a redditor who is a fellow Tensura enjoyer that has DM’d me rather personal stuff and done his bet to gather information about his personality and nature so that he may get this Tensura build. Please be respectful and not make any comments on the challenger today as this is very deep and personal stuff that most of wouldn’t ever share and so please keep this mind for the new challenger as well who have DM’d me and will be featured later in other challenges. 



Challenge 5 - Woman in her 20’s who is currently preparing for an exam to apply for her dream job. She seems to somewhat struggle with her goals, desires and dreams and is often insecure about them because she isn’t certain if what she believes to be her dream is truly her calling. She is relatively hard working in hopes of achieving her dream, but she has heard other people talk about their dreams, hopes and desires, and they all seem so passionate and overwhelmingly engrossed with them that they are willing to do anything, but she herself has never felt that way about anything regardless of what it may be and she has felt something similar for her current supposed dream but it’s not quite the same. She has tried to find her true calling by various personality tests, introspection, going through various jobs, hobbies and other things but nothing has ever truly felt like it.

Despite the seeming insecurities about her dreams, she is quite confident in herself and because of her confidence it is easier to connect with others, though sometimes the people she is friends with bring about feelings of inadequacy in her due to their accomplishments and their skills, but regardless she is happy for them whenever they achieve something. Despite her social nature, she is actually quite introverted preferring her own company and is constantly watching or reading something in her free time.

She is exceptionally clever having a superior IQ level and has always been considered wise for her age, usually calm, cool and collected but also somewhat clumsy. She loves animals and believes them to be precious but not all animals and despite her love and kind nature towards animals she herself is quite fearful of them if they are around her and not separated from her via a door or something that keeps them at a distance, a sort of love from afar. She often finds Villains to be more fascinating and relatable than Heroes. Her interests revolve around topics like nature vs nurture, life, death and the secrets of the cosmos, and finds certain conspiracy theories interesting.

She can be rather Judgmental due to her impressive intellect and often finds flaws in things. She has a great deal of skill in creative pursuits such as writing, poetry, painting etc. she can play the piano to a degree and the violin.

She is very kind and caring for her friends and family and for animals but for most others she is indifferent. She doesn’t like to go out too often but is often dragged around by her friends she is also quite a drama queen and loves to exaggerate things believing it to be romantic and poetic. She hates arrogant, cocky, entitled and annoying people who are extremely prideful being really stupid and being always saved by their luck.

She is often fascinated by various topics and usually learns everything there is to know about them purely because she is intrigued but after a while ends forgetting whatever she acquired. She has a vivid imagination, which she uses as fuel for her art and creative pursuit, she enjoys the more dark, and eldritch types of stories and art as well as beautiful pictures of nature. Despite her intrigue with darker aspects of her psyche she isn’t beholden to it and enjoys the simple and elegant beauty of nature, often finding solace and comfort underneath the branches of a tree and the protection it provides from the scorching heat of the Sun, the smell of grass after heavy rainfall and the trickling noises made by the water, the smell of roasted coffee beans etc.

She adores the comfort of her own home as well if not more so than nature, her preference for comfort is paramount. She prefers cozy movies, shows and environments. To her a perfect day is when she has nothing to do, no obligations of any kind, and heavy rainfall with some thunder outside as it stays in the periphery of her view while she watches a cozy movie or show with her favorite snacks, food and drinks. She has a great big collection of old books that she often flips through in her free time. She enjoys cooking as a hobby and makes some drinks like hot cocoa to enjoy with books or movies. She has a strong opinion on the ways stories are written and portrayed via different mediums.

She believes that every moment of life must be appreciated and tries to live in the present as much as she can. Her brain is constantly thinking of a multitude of things, about all her problems and troubles and her many ideas for art and stories.

She’s still figuring out who she is, and hopes to gain insights from this community through this Tensura build.


Scenario 1 - Reincarnation Rimuru style to Cardinal World, however no events of death or such will be mentioned as this is a real person and so you may creatively think in that regard.

Scenario 2 - Summoning into Cardinal World by a dying adventurer to kill a monster that wiped out their party.

1hhoerq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hhoerq/can_the_lifewater_hydrogen_water_bottle_really/,Can the LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle Really Change How You Hydrate? My Experience,"Hydration is something most of us don’t think too deeply about. We drink water, tick off our “8 glasses a day,” and call it good. That’s pretty much how I lived my life until recently, when I stumbled upon the concept of **hydrogen water**. It sounded futuristic—too fancy for something as simple as water. But after reading about its potential health benefits, I decided to try it out, starting with the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**.

This is my journey so far with it—no fluff, no sales talk, just the good, the surprising, and even the meh.

# What is a LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle Anyway?

Let’s get the basics out of the way first. The **lifewater hydrogen bottle** isn’t just a fancy water container. It uses advanced technology to infuse your water with molecular hydrogen. This may sound overly scientific, but here’s the simplified version: it makes your water “smarter.”

Hydrogen-infused water is thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially helping with:

* **Reducing oxidative stress** that contributes to aging and chronic conditions.
* **Better hydration** at a cellular level.
* **Boosting energy levels** without relying on stimulants.
* **Improved recovery** after workouts.

The process is straightforward. Fill the bottle, press the button, and in just three minutes, your regular water transforms into hydrogen-rich water. There’s no change in taste, but the impact is where it gets interesting.

# Why Hydrogen Water?

This was my first question when I started looking into it. Why add hydrogen to water, and how could it possibly make a difference? Turns out, the benefits are rooted in science.

Hydrogen is the smallest molecule in the universe, meaning it can easily penetrate your cells and deliver its antioxidant properties where they’re most needed. Studies suggest it helps combat free radicals, reduces inflammation, and even supports better hydration. For someone like me, who often feels dehydrated despite drinking enough water, the concept was intriguing.

# How It Works

The **lifewater bottle** uses **Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE)** and **Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)** technology. In simple terms, this technology splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is vented out, leaving hydrogen gas infused into the water.

The bottle is compact, easy to use, and has no ongoing maintenance—no filters to replace, which is a relief for anyone tired of extra steps. It’s designed to be portable and leakproof, so you can take it anywhere without worrying about spills.

# What Happened When I Used It

I’ve been using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** for a few weeks now. Here’s what I noticed:

1. **Day 1–3**:
   * No immediate dramatic effects, but the water tasted fresh and smooth.
   * I felt slightly more energized during the day, but I wasn’t sure if it was just placebo.
2. **By the End of Week 1**:
   * **Energy Levels**: I was waking up less groggy and relying less on my afternoon coffee.
   * **Hydration**: I didn’t feel as thirsty as usual. It was like the water was “lasting longer” in my system.
   * **Skin**: My skin started to feel softer and looked less dull.
3. **Week 2 and Beyond**:
   * **Inflammation**: I have mild joint discomfort from an old sports injury, and while it didn’t completely go away, it felt less stiff after consistent use.
   * **Mental Clarity**: This was unexpected, but I noticed fewer brain fog moments during long workdays.

# Who Could Benefit from the LifeWater Bottle?

From my experience and the research I’ve read, this bottle isn’t just for hydration geeks. It can be a game-changer for:

* **Athletes**: Faster recovery and better hydration during workouts.
* **People with inflammation issues**: Conditions like arthritis, gout, or general muscle soreness.
* **Busy individuals**: If you’re juggling work, family, or life and need sustained energy.
* **Anyone seeking better skin health**: The antioxidant properties might help improve complexion.
* **Those curious about wellness trends**: If you’re open to trying something innovative, this is worth exploring.

# What Stands Out

Here’s what I’ve really liked about the **lifewater hydrogen bottle**:

* **Simplicity**: It’s plug-and-play. Fill it with water, press a button, and wait three minutes. No complicated setup.
* **Portable and Durable**: It’s lightweight and easy to carry, with no leaking issues.
* **No Taste Change**: Hydrogen water tastes just like regular water—clean and fresh.
* **No Maintenance**: Unlike some bottles, there’s no need for filter replacements or expensive extras.

# Things to Consider

Of course, nothing’s perfect. Here are a couple of things I’d flag:

* **Price**: It’s more expensive than your standard reusable water bottle, but that’s expected for the technology it offers.
* **Charging**: The base needs to be recharged every few days. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something to keep in mind if you travel frequently.

# What I’ve Learned

Using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** has made me think more critically about hydration—not just how much water I drink, but how efficiently it hydrates me. I didn’t expect drastic changes, but the small, consistent improvements in energy, skin health, and overall hydration have been noticeable.

I’m not saying this bottle will change your life overnight, but if you’re someone who struggles with hydration or wants to optimize your water intake, it’s worth looking into.

# Final Thoughts

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** has been a surprisingly effective addition to my routine. It’s not flashy or gimmicky—it just works quietly in the background to help you hydrate better. If you’ve been curious about hydrogen water, this is a great way to dip your toes in without committing to something overly complicated.

For me, it’s been a small but meaningful upgrade to how I approach health and wellness. If that sounds like something you’d benefit from, give it a try.

Hey Reddit! I need to share my amazing experience from yesterday's Grand Canyon South Rim tour. I've been putting this trip off for years (I know, I know), but finally pulled the trigger and I'm honestly kicking myself for not doing it sooner.

First off, if you're in Vegas and debating whether it's worth the day trip - absolutely YES. I booked through this link (https://athometouch.com/SouthRim) and got a pretty sweet deal at $80. The whole experience was super smooth from start to finish.

The tour started early (like, really early) with a hotel pickup around 6 AM. Pro tip: grab coffee beforehand because the first proper stop isn't until Kingman, Arizona. Our bus was actually pretty comfortable - had AC and a bathroom, which trust me, you'll appreciate during the 5-hour drive.

Our guide, Mike, was this hilarious dude who kept us entertained with random Canyon facts and stories. Did you guys know that the Grand Canyon is actually younger than dinosaurs? Mind-blown moment right there.

The South Rim views... man, pictures don't do it justice. We hit up multiple viewpoints, but Mather Point literally had me speechless. It's like your brain can't process how massive and colorful everything is. The layered rocks look like someone painted them - reds, purples, oranges, it's wild.

I opted for the helicopter upgrade (totally worth the extra cash), and seeing the Canyon from above was a completely different experience. If you can swing it financially, DO IT. The perspective you get is insane.

The included meal voucher came in handy - decent food options at the National Geographic Visitor Center. I went with the burger, solid 7/10.

Quick tips if you're planning to go:
- Wear comfy shoes (lots of walking)
- Bring a jacket (it gets chilly at the rim)
- Pack snacks
- Don't forget your camera/phone charger
- Book in advance, especially during peak season

For anyone interested, here's the link I used to book: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim 
They often run special deals and the customer service was super responsive when I had questions.

Happy to answer any questions in the comments! This trip seriously exceeded my expectations, and I'm already planning to go back in the fall to see the sunset views.

1hhoabi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RabbitRank/comments/1hhoabi/the_best_seo_service_in_austin_a_digital/,The Best SEO Service in Austin: A Digital Marketer’s Odyssey,"Let me tell you, if you’ve ever tried to find a [genuinely good SEO service](https://rabbitrank.com/guest-posts/), you probably know what it’s like to sift through a sea of “We’ll rank you #1 on Google in 24 hours!” ads. Spoiler alert: they won’t. 😐 As someone who’s been in the trenches of digital marketing for years (read: too many late nights Googling algorithms and drowning in coffee), I figured, “Hey, how hard could it be to find [a top-notch SEO service in Austin](https://rabbitrank.com/why-i-think-rabbit-rank-is-the-best-seo-agency-in-austin/)?”

Narrator voice: It was hard.

So, buckle up. I’m spilling all the tea on my chaotic yet educational journey to find the best SEO service in Austin—complete with mishaps, small wins, and that one agency that ghosted me after I asked too many questions. (Yeah, **that** happened.)

# Chapter 1: The Craigslist Catastrophe 🐱💻

I started my search the way any reasonable person would: Google. But, in a moment of pure madness (or perhaps desperation), I ventured onto Craigslist. Look, I know what you’re thinking: **Why would you do that?** Honestly, I thought I’d find some quirky, indie SEO guru who prefers working from coffee shops and doesn’t even **own** a website. Spoiler: I didn’t.

Instead, I found someone who promised “magical traffic boosts” for $200. Skeptical but curious (and maybe a little too trusting after a long day), I reached out. The conversation started fine—until they asked for my website login details **before** explaining their strategy. 🚩 Huge red flag. I noped out of there faster than you can say, “black-hat SEO.”

# Chapter 2: The Overpriced “Experts” 🤑

After the Craigslist debacle, I went legit—big-name agencies with flashy websites and long client lists. I’ll admit, their portfolios were impressive. Case studies with phrases like “700% growth in organic traffic!” practically screamed at me. I set up a few discovery calls, feeling hopeful.

But here’s the thing: these folks know how to talk a big game. One agency rep spent 20 minutes explaining their proprietary algorithm (which they wouldn’t elaborate on because “trade secrets,” of course). When I asked for pricing, they hit me with a five-figure quote just for an audit. Not even actual SEO work—just an audit. I politely excused myself, closed my laptop, and stared into the void for a good 10 minutes. 💸

# Chapter 3: The “Mom-and-Pop” Charm ❤️

By now, I was convinced that finding the perfect SEO service was like trying to spot a unicorn in downtown Austin. But then, I stumbled upon a small, family-run agency—let’s call them Austin Organic Pros. Their pitch? No frills, no promises of overnight success, just solid, white-hat SEO tailored to small businesses.

They were refreshingly honest during our consultation. They explained **why** it takes time to rank organically, shared a transparent pricing structure, and even threw in some tips I could implement myself. They didn’t push for a hard sell, which was a nice change of pace. It felt like talking to a friend who **actually** knows their stuff.

# Chapter 4: The Reddit Rabbit Hole 🕳️

I almost didn’t want to include this part because it’s so **embarrassingly** me, but here we are. Late one night, fueled by caffeine and existential dread, I found myself deep in a Reddit thread about SEO services in Austin. (Side note: Reddit is underrated for this kind of thing. People are brutally honest.)

The top comment? A glowing recommendation for a boutique agency that focused on local SEO. Skeptical but intrigued, I checked out their website. It wasn’t flashy, but it had real reviews from local businesses, not just “John D.” from who-knows-where. I shot them an email, and to my surprise, they responded **that same night.** Major points for effort.

# Chapter 5: The Winner (Drumroll, Please 🥁)

After weeks of research, I ended up going with that boutique agency from Reddit. Let’s call them Local Boosters. They weren’t the cheapest, but they were reasonable, and their approach felt genuine. They did a killer job optimizing my local listings, tweaking my website structure, and giving me a clear game plan for content creation. Within a few months, I saw a steady increase in organic traffic and—most importantly—leads.

# Lessons Learned (So You Don’t Have to Suffer Like I Did)

1. **Beware of Overpromises:** If an agency claims they can get you on page one of Google in a week, run. 🏃‍♂️
2. **Transparency Is Key:** Look for companies that explain their process in plain English, not SEO jargon.
3. **Check Reviews:** And not just the ones on their website. Yelp, Google Reviews, and Reddit are your best friends.
4. **Trust Your Gut:** If something feels off (like Craigslist guy asking for logins), it probably is.
5. **Patience Pays Off:** Good SEO takes time. If you’re looking for quick wins, you’re better off running ads.

So, there you have it—my rollercoaster of a journey to find the best SEO service in Austin. If you’re in the same boat, I hope this helps you avoid some of the pitfalls I stumbled into.

Rent is expensive, utilities suck, and as a result, my mom spends almost all her time dashing. 

The problem I'm running into is that whenever I try to call her out for unacceptable behavior (only ever coming out to ""check on me"" when I'm engaged in spicy webcam time, trapping me in conversations when I JUST told her I'm peopled out, moving or rearranging my property without permission, etc) she'll explicitly deny it. Pointing out specific instances of her behavior leads to her doing mental gymnastics to reframe and justify her actions, and it ultimately leads to her falling back on the tried and true ""I HaVe tO work!!1!1"" to get out of the argument. 

Despite otherwise having a genuine growth-based attitude, it seems like the six words I can never get her to say are ""I'm sorry, Morgan. I was wrong.""

Like, she's not a massive manipulator or anything. She's genuinely one of the sweetest people I've ever known, and I truly feel like I won the mother lottery compared to a lot of other people, but god damn, the seemingly intentional misunderstandings and evasions coupled with the 100% reliable fallback of her claiming she needs to work (which I can't say anything about bc with our financial situation, it literally always holds true) are pushing me beyond a breaking point I didn't know I had. 

tl;dr Is there a term for this specific form of deflection where someone uses ""I HAVE TO WORK!!!1!1!"" or ""I'M JUST MAKING COFFEE!!"" or ""I'M JUST {doing obvious thing I can see with my own two eyes that has absolutely nothing to do with the shitty behavior being called out}"" as a way to escape having to take responsibility and make changes for the better? I'm so tired of trying to explain it to her only for her to weasel her way out from under it because ALL the technicalities didn't line up 100% perfectly to every previous instance of deflection.

I left when I was 10 years old and have been back maybe 4-5 times, with the most recent trip in 2022. I'm now in my late 20s. I usually only stay for about 3 weeks max, so I'm not really familiar with everything in Iloilo anymore. Ano na subong ang mga famous nga kalan-an? Any new restaurants nga namit? I'm not picky with food. Also, what about new hangout spots? I'm not really into the party scene; more of a coffee/foodie person. Thanks in advance!",5,1734596101.0,Iloilo,0,1.0,False

Machine bought - 50's Style Espresso Coffee Machine with Grinder - if this means anything. 

Interested in coffee bean recommendations, I drink primarily iced lattes and my partner mostly drinks cappuccinos.

Leaning towards St.Ali just as we have seen AndyCooks on Insta use the brand quite a bit, and have seen a lot of people speak highly of the Aldi brands.

Obviously will need to try a few out to see what sticks but want to try and narrow down the 1000s of options to try the highly recommended ones first. ",1,1734596063.0,melbourne,3,1.0,False
