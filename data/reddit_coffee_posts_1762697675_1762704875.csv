1osn5fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1osn5fj/we_live_comfortably_because_others_dont/,We Live Comfortably Because Others Don't,"
I grew up in one of those in-between countries. You know the type, decent schools, young people, but most people are broke (by western standards). Then I moved to Northern Europe. One of those places that always tops the ""best quality of life"" lists.
And yeah, it's nice here. Really nice. Healthcare works. Streets are clean. People have time for hobbies. It's the kind of place that makes you think, ""Why can't everywhere be like this?""
Then it hit me: everywhere can't be like this because this only works if everywhere else isn't.
Northern Europe wouldn't exist without Bangladesh. Without Niger. Without all the countries we don't think about.

The clothes we wear, the phones we use, the coffee we drink, the fuel we burn, it all comes from somewhere. And that somewhere is usually a place where people work for pennies under conditions we'd never accept for ourselves. We get cheap stuff, they get exploitation. That's the deal.
It's like having a really clean house because you shoved all the mess into a storage room. The house looks great, but only because the chaos is hidden somewhere else.
And then we have the nerve to get mad when people from the storage room try to enter the main house.
""They're illegal."" ""They don't belong here."" ""They're taking our jobs.""

How is that fair? These people aren't asking for a handout. They're asking for the same opportunities we have, opportunities we got partly because their countries stayed poor. We extracted their resources, paid starvation wages, destabilized their governments when it was profitable, and now we act offended when they want a better life.
If we actually wanted everyone on Earth to live like we do in wealthy countries, we'd have to give things up. Real things. Smaller homes. Less shopping. Fewer flights. Higher prices because we're not relying on cheap labor anymore.

But that's not happening. The system is designed to keep things unequal, and those of us benefiting from it aren't interested in changing it.
Here's the worst part: We don't even let them develop on their own. Foreign aid comes with strings attached. Loans force them to gut public services. Trade deals favor our corporations. And when a country tries to prioritize its own people over foreign profits? Suddenly there are sanctions. Or coups.
So fine, don't help them. But at least stop ruining the planet while you're at it.

Because the countries that contributed almost nothing to climate change are the ones getting hit hardest. Floods, droughts, crop failures, all consequences of our industrial excess. And when climate disasters force people to migrate, we build walls and call it a ""crisis."" As if we didn't create it.
We talk about equality and human rights, but the system is rigged. We hoard opportunity and then act confused when people are desperate to get what we have.

People born in the Global South aren't less worthy. They're not less capable. They just lost the birth lottery. And the fact that we're okay with that, that we've built our comfort on their suffering and then resent them for wanting better, says everything about how the system really works.
It's not broken. It's working exactly as designed. We just don't like admitting who it's designed for.",1,1762704523.0,DeepThoughts,1,0.67,False

1osn590,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1osn590/i_want_to_do_something_more_with_my_life/,I want to do something more with my life,"I'm a young guy in my early twenties, currently doing a bachelor's in computer science. I love programming, it brings me joy to create new programs. Computer science is the kind of job that has good advantages, such as remote work, relatively high pay, and relative stability. 

Despite that, it's just not what I want to do in life. The more I find out about the way things work in industry, the more dejected I feel. 

I have a firmly anti-AI stance in my life, and I go out of my way as much as possible to avoid using AI. That opinion does not seem to be shared among my classmates, nor in the industry. Our teacher told us that nowadays, lots of companies require their employees to use AI. I don't want to have to break my ethical principles to find a job!

I'm also feeling put down by the overly corporate and capitalist culture around programming companies. I've recently started going to events to find connections within the industry, and the whole atmosphere is off for me. It seems deeply inauthentic, like everyone is fake and everyone knows everyone else is fake. It just seems so depressing to think that if I get a job in computer science, I'll work in similar environments for the rest of my life.

The worst part is, I know I'd be good at this kind of life if I choose it. I usually make good first impressions on people, and I'm able to navigate corporate culture pretty easily. I'm also very professional and a good coder in general (in my uni's computer science department, I get grades among the top 10%). 

But I want to do more in life than this! My true passion is theatre acting. I've been acting in various projects since I was 11, even throughout my demanding computer science studies. Every time I get to read a new script and learn about a new character, stepping on stage under the gaze of hundreds of people, I feel alive. 

I love being on stage, feeling the audience melt away as I embody a character and become someone else. I love being backstage, doing quick changes and makeup adjustments before going back. I love the rehearsals, however grueling they can get; staying until 10-11 PM in the theatre, leaving feeling drained but satisfied with the day's work. 

I love memorizing my lines in the morning in front of a cup of coffee, getting my partner or friends to play the other characters. I love doing auditions, even when they're stressful. I love the cozy little theatre networking events, so far away from the corporate events of the computer science world.

The world of theatre feels so familiar and warm, while the world of computer science feels so distant and, again, corporate. I can't see myself being 30 or 40, working as a normal senior dev in a normal company, putting on my suit and tie each morning before going to work for meetings that don't matter and coding for projects that I don't give a fuck about. I can see myself being 30-40 as an actor, though, playing various characters, living in an environment that challenges me to become a better person.

The one thing that's holding me back is money and stability. My parents and I immigrated when I was young, and they sacrificed everything so I could have a stable life here. They are immensely proud of me for choosing computer science. They know I like acting, and support it, but only as a hobby. My friends, too, think that becoming an actor would be to choose a bohemian life over a stable one. 

I just don't know what to do. I only live once, and I want to make the most of it, instead of becoming a bitter and resentful old man with unfulfilled creative potential. But also, in this increasingly unstable world, is it worth it to chase a fleeting dream that can lead me to ruin? Only a small percentage of actors ever make a living from it, and I'm afraid to not be part of that percentage. 

As internet strangers, what's your opinion?

1osn2il,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1osn2il/review_dump_cozy_nongourmand_scents_part_3/,Review dump: Cozy non-gourmand scents (Part 3),"Friends, I bring you [ten more reviews](https://old.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1mnmbcq/review_dump_cozy_nongourmand_scents_part_2/) of cozy scents for the gourmand hater. Now that we’re fully in the season for snuggly scents, these are finally timely! Just like last time, I wanted to avoid straight-up numerical ratings because I find them a little reductive but I generally arranged this list in order of least favorite to most favorite (according to my personal taste):

**BPAL - The Human Double** *The uncanny echo of your second self: a shadow-blackened fougere steeped in an uncanny, discomfiting lavender tar.* I love lavender but this smells like lavender's evil twin, it's so weirdly sinister. It's like lavender bitters and burnt flesh offerings. Makes me smell like I've been fused The Fly style with a bottle of lavender essential oil and then set loose upon the screaming populace. If you like lavender and are confused when other people think it’s harsh, walk in their shoes by smelling this.

**Is it cozy?** >!Actually it feels like it's trying to trick me into thinking it's cozy, for a malicious reason.!< 

**Lovesick Witchery - Nightmare** *clean cotton, salt, labdanum, black oud, cedarwood, blue cypress, and a drop of vanilla.* I was very intrigued by the ""sweaty sheets"" note in the description of this, but I'm getting clean cotton and maybe the blue cypress? Ocean breeze type vibe? I think I would love this scent in a linen spray but I don’t know that it suits me as a perfume.

**Is it cozy?** >!Yeah. Actually I’m having a really nice dream.!<

**Nui Cobalt - Sacred Space** *A misty, moss-covered glen, a simple wooden pagoda, steam from a cup of black tea, a tendril of incense smoke.* On paper, I like everything about this. I fuck with many of Nui Cobalt's incense and tea scents. On my skin … fancy hand soap.

**Is it cozy?** >!It’s nice but I wash my hands already. I hope you do too but if you don’t, boy do I have the perfume for you.!<

**Poesie - Black Cat Cuddles** *Sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon & black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest.* I sometimes have trouble figuring out what the “story” of a perfume is or what it’s trying to evoke. Here’s my guess for this one: “Local cat terrorizes Starbucks employees, swiping chai syrups onto the floor and fleeing the scene. Law enforcement apprehended the suspect napping in a nearby park after rolling around in the dirt, seemingly unconcerned. More on this story as it develops.”

**Is it cozy?** >!Yes, it’s a nice spiced coconut chai skin scent to wear when you want to smell soft but not necessarily like you're wearing perfume.!<

**Solstice Scents - Sawmill** *Fresh Cut Wood, Wood Resin, Balsam, Cured Woods, Pine, Black Coffee, Motor Oil, Amber, Saw Dust.* Hot in a way I can’t possibly explain. S tier pull for the boymoders. I pass a lumberyard on my way to work and I am astounded by the accuracy of the notes here. Is there actually motor oil in this? Is this safe for the baby? (I'm not pregnant, the baby is me)

**Is it cozy?** >!It's not just lumber, it's the whole industrial floor. I’d use this to set the mood for an erotic production supervisor/rookie production assistant roleplay, not to get cozy.!<

**Sorce - Moon Magic** *Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord)* It's weird, but I get like a... lavender marshmallow top note, then a vanilla after-dinner mints drydown from this? I think that must be the crystal accord. Everyone else seems to be getting spicy lavender chai instead, probably that means I should try more EdPs. Anyway this slaps, I prefer it over Snow Moon Magic which I think is a slightly controversial take?

**Is it cozy?** >!Yes, it’s for the person who’s reading tarot in a flowy satin dressing gown.!<

**Hexennacht - Baltic Amber** *thick rivulets of golden amber, pinus succinifera, cedarwood, jammy fir absolute, oakmoss absolute, tree moss, verdant musk, cardamom, balsam, lightning-scorched ancient boughs.* Thick, heady, syrupy amber resin. STRONK. Fragrance that lets you reality shift into the universe where you’re a mosquito in the process of becoming a paperweight. 

**Is it cozy?** >!Am I going out to mark my territory or am I just going to bed? Finally, a versatile scent for both.!<

**Solstice Scents - Woodstove** *Cherry Wood Smoke, Wood Resin, Charred Wood, Wood Incense, Embers, Ash* When first applied this is a foghorn blast of liquid smoke, but luckily it calms down. In an hour it smells like... candied charcoal briquettes? Cashmere scarf dropped in a cold firepit? There’s something soft and a little sweet that hugs the edges of the smoke, something that makes it impossible to stop huffing your wrists when you’re wearing it. 

**Is it cozy?** >!Makes Cinderella feel right at home.!<

**Morari - A Squirrel Goes Trick-or-Treating** *Sugared Acorns, Ponderosa Pine, Agarwood, Virginia Cedar, Woody Cashmere Base.* Delightful. Dry wood, toasted nuts, and Morari's addictive cashmere base. I feel like I'm locked inside a cedar chest suffocating in the blankets (don't rescue me).

**Is it cozy?** >!Yes. I would have called this one ""Squirrel stays home"". Squirrel’s got the fire lit, a sweater, a blanket, and slippers. Squirrel’s getting blackout drunk and you’re leaving squirrel alone.!<

**Olympic Orchids - Woodcut** *Fractional distillations of pine and cedar, oakwood absolute, tolu balsam, olibanum, caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla.* This smells like a perfectly scorched marshmallow that’s warm from the campfire being held out to you by a... sexy tree. I don't know, I'm not on trial here.

**Is it cozy?** >!Yes. Incredible. Not only full size but daily scent territory. Carry me through the winter.!<

Big and heartfelt thank-you again to everyone who recommended these to me. I can probably bust the rest of these reviews out in one more (slightly larger) post, but that batch includes a handful each from Cardinal Scents and Death & Floral, so your guess is as good as mine when that will be out.

1osn1zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1osn1zg/finally_asked_her_out/,Finally asked her out,"Hey all! Praise be Jesus Christ. This is a follow-up to my post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/s/DHNoV7nqj7

After almost a month of what seemed to be signs that she didn’t want to be bothered after mass (always walking out without talking, somewhere to be, etc) I finally was able to catch her and shoot my pitch. Told her I understand she has somewhere to be, so I asked her out for coffee and asked if she’d be interested in doing that with me. 

To my honest surprise she in fact said “Yes! We can do coffee!” And gave me her number. All this anxiety and looking for “signs” almost squashed out any hope before I even asked. Funny thing is after saying our goodbyes after she gave it, my phone glitched and didn’t save the number. I had to go down to the parish center where she was at and painfully had to ask again. She was very warm and welcoming, and still seemed happy to give it. Honestly I can’t wait. Please pray that none of us get cold feet!

If I had to give any advice, today goes to show that someone walking right to their car/ somewhere after mass doesn’t always mean “don’t talk to me.” I was like that when first coming to this church, but was always fine with someone coming to talk to me. It might be a time commitment, or natural habit. Asking her today, she seemed happy to give it, but a little shy as well. Thank Our Lord that even though my mind saw signs of “oh man I messed it up shes not interested blah blah.” You truly never do know until you ask. Thank you all for your prayers, as I will remember you in mine!",3,1762704296.0,CatholicDating,0,1.0,False

And not a single one I’ll send. 

Oh, you. I take my coffee with milk. No sugar. If I buy it- it’s iced latte no flavors. Following rough nights, it’s extra shots. With an iced green tea no sweetener. Extra ice. I’ll sip it the rest of the day between waters. I like beverages. What can I say. 

This morning the windows are open and the cool air feels so good. My house smells like the breakfast tacos and coffee I’ve made while I sturdy myself for the work ahead of me today. This next stretch starts in just a few hours. 

Someone on another sub, their advice for what my life has in it was this: “meditate, realize your life is over, meditate some more.” Doesn’t that make you want to just laugh and cry at the same time? Unironically, it’s solid advice. 

I’m babbling about myself. Because what I wish I could explain to you - feels indescribable. And maybe that’s what makes me fall off the wagon and write you here again. This void where you’ll never be and never see.

*I don’t know you. We’ve never **really** talked. I may never have the words to explain the love and affection I have for you. It’s illogical and unhinged. To care for someone, so much, who wants nothing to do with me. To care for you. You, who I’ll never see or speak to again. It’s ridiculous that my heart still remembers the icy hot heat bursting in my chest when I’d look into your eyes. It’s delusional to reimagine versions of our shared history that conjure daydreams that you ever wanted to know me. To see me. And I could never, ever, tell a soul that even now I swear to whatever is out there that I feel you tugging at me. I’d be ridiculed if you knew that when I long term plan, as one does with what’s in my life, my heart longs to return to the only city that felt like home. As unattached as I’ll ever be. With fruitless hopes that you wish for that, too. None of it is reality. None of it makes a lick a sense.*

Most of all, it’s a waste of energy, isn’t it? 

To sit here on this beautiful morning. Sipping my perfect cup of coffee in a pink shiny mug that proclaims “trust the process”…wishing that you wanted to tell me how you like your coffee. Wishing that you wanted me to make you tacos and that you’d let me in, even just to know what book you’re reading this cool morning. And if you like your bacon extra crispy, too. 

A sweet, sad beautiful waste. 

Love always,
Me

Today he said he was feeling su*cidal.,"For context, my husband and I have opposite schedules. I wake up naturally at 6am, and he can sleep until noon on days he doesn’t work. We started to realize this was cutting into a lot of our time we have together, so HE came up with a plan to sleep in Saturdays, wake up around 8-9am Sundays. This was about two weeks ago. Before Halloween we were supposed to go to a pumpkin patch, but that was cancelled bc he “didn’t feel good”. We cancelled Halloween plans with friends as well for the same reason. We went discount Halloween shopping the next morning for an hour, then he spent the rest of the day playing video games.
Well he went out of town for work this week, and I was so excited for him to be home. Of course he comes in and talks for a few minutes, then says “would it be cool to hop on the game? All the guys are on and I haven’t talked to them in a few days.” I felt instantly hurt bc I had also been waiting to see him for days, yet this seemed to be his priority. When he saw I was hurt he said he wouldn’t get on, then promised to take me to a movie the next morning to make things up.
Next morning comes. I’m so excited for the movie. He comes in around 11 saying “what if we do the movie another day? I’m just not feeling it.”
I just began to cry. I don’t know how many times I can be put off. Again, he gives into the crying and says we can go. I don’t cry to get what I want - I’m crying bc I’m hurt, and he thinks just giving me what I want is what makes it stop. He doesn’t realize that now every plan feels tainted bc he was “manipulated” into it.
Finally this morning, he had told me last night we will wake up early together to run and errand and grab coffee together. Not a huge plan, but I was still so, so excited to just have the morning with him. He even woke up at 7:45!!! I was so excited, I hopped on the bed and asked what time he was wanting to go. He just said “give me a couple of more hours.”
That was my straw. I broke. I went into the living room and just ugly wailed into a pillow. He came in arguing that he “forgot” he promised to wake up on one weekend day, that he didn’t know why I was in “such a rush to run errands”. It’s because I don’t see them as errands - I see them as time with him I don’t otherwise really get without a fight.
He says he feels like he can “never do anything right”. I told him his problem is he is so concerned with getting things “right” that he doesn’t have the skillset to deescalate any situation when things aren’t perfect. Instead of “oh yeah, my bad, I did make that promise. Just give me a few to wake up and get ready.”, I was met with how it was my fault and I am being unreasonably picky.
This was when he said he was feeling suicidal, and that he doesn’t want to be here if he can’t do anything right. I told him thank you for putting that on my radar, I really hate that he is feeling this way, but I need some space bc after everything he did not comfort me once. Yet the tables had turned where he needed my sympathy. I felt so strange. He recently has been on a new medication for depression that he claims has been a miracle, that he’s never felt better, and I can see how much better he feels in all aspects of his life….except for me. When I ask if I’m doing anything to cause this, I’m reassured I’m not doing anything. That doesn’t make sense to me I guess.

I’m truly at a complete loss. It’s worn me down so much to constantly fight with my husband over spending time together. If we ever do get to do something (I.e. watch Tv on the couch), if  I have the nerve to say a few days later that I’d like to spend time together it’s always “but we spent two hours together the other day!”

Please, tell me if it’s me. If I’m ungrateful, demanding, and smothering like I feel.",0,1762704246.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

1osmzi3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osmzi3,I did only boss swaps on Ironclad on my journey to A20 - Here's how it went:,"The first slide is all the relics I got from the boss swaps and how it went. I'm mostly not surprised, though Ectoplasm did a lot worse than I thought subjectively, I was always happy to see it. Obviously the relic you get changes the way you try and build/path. There's a chance I leaned too hard into elites with Slaver's Collar and Black Star, but they (along with Tiny House) are the ones I was least excited to see.

  
The second slide is all relics regardless of when taken and how they did. I'm kind of surprised you can't get Runic Dome as a boss swap, maybe it's just too strong? Coffee Dripper and to a lesser extent Cursed Key I understand, since they could very easily tank your run. I'm happy to see that my love for Pandora's Box is well-founded, and I think that Runic Dome and Busted Crown are a little artificially inflated since they're usually the relics you take when you're already winning.

  
The final slide details my journey through the ascensions and the enemies that killed me along the way. An interesting balance of losses to the Act 3 bosses (two each), and I'm honestly surprised the Book of Stabbing hasn't gotten me more often on this journey.

  
For the purposes of this data, a win is defined as beating the Act 3 boss, regardless of what happens in Act 4.

Also, I am just a curious person and I spend time finding things like this online so sometimes I just wonder about stuff but I don't take it seriously). 

So I'm assuming what I said after that must've triggered her bc she starts yelling at me out of nowhere and starts yelling at my dad (and the poor man's just sitting at the table trying to enjoy his coffee 😂)while she's literally chopping potatoes then screamed at me to leave and said that if she wanted me to get stabbed and like an insane person starts CHOPPING potatoes like a maniac.

Hey everyone! 👋

We’re a couple in our 30s based in Chembur, looking to make some new friends around the area. Most of our close friends have moved out of Mumbai, and we’d love to meet like-minded people nearby.

A little about us:

One of us works in marketing, enjoys badminton (or really any sport), reading, music, and travel, and loves old-school ways to unwind — think long conversations over chai.

The other works in consulting, loves movies, karaoke, and books, and is always up for trying new food spots.

We’re both foodies who enjoy discovering hidden gems and exploring different cuisines across the city.

We’d love to connect with other couples or individuals (preferably 28 and above) who enjoy relaxed weekends, board games, good food, and conversations. Whether it’s a game of badminton, a movie night, or just a quiet coffee catch-up, we’re open to it all.

I met him 3 months ago at a mutual friend’s birthday. We started texting the next day, then hanging out once or twice a week at coffee shops or the park. The first 2 months were good. 

Last month, I noticed the switch... shorter replies, less enthusiasm to make plans. When I brought it up, he said, “You’re overthinking. I’m just busy.” But then he’d still watch my stories minutes after I posted. If I became distant he would say ""Are u ok?, as if he just didn't want me to forget about him. When I tried to leave twice, both times he pulled me back in with a long voice note about how he “cares deeply” but “isn’t good with emotions.” I know how that sounds. I left anyways. 

What I feel currently: (I am honest, don't judge me) 

1) I know he isn't the one for me.
2) I know I can find better. 
3) I don't want him to date someone else 
4) If he dates someone else, I want him to be happy but not happier than when he was with me 
5) He is handsome 
6) I want him to regret losing me 
7) I miss the good times 
8) I don't want to date him 
9) I'm not questioning myself I'm amazing and beautiful

1osmsq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1osmsq4/my_therapist_making_me_take_a_break/,My therapist making me take a ‘break’,"Hi everyone,

I posted on a here a few months ago about an experience with my therapist that caused me a great deal of pain.

After over two years, she made me take a sudden ‘break’ from therapy with no referrals and no gradual tapering. She said I had to go away for six months as I was too attached to her and the therapy was not contained enough. The boundaries of the relationship were incredibly blurred, we would often text and email outside of sessions (she always replied in a very friendly way), we would hug each other etc. She told me that she would never leave me and that if I ever get married, she would come to my wedding, and that after therapy we could ‘meet up for coffee and cake’. I started to think of her like a permanent figure in my life and then she suggested suddenly I need to see a psychiatrist because I was so attached. The psychiatrist said I was just anxious.

The experience has been more painful than anything I’ve ever experienced by miles. I had to take two weeks off work with the stress and the grief, and I could barely eat for a few days. 

Like an idiot, I asked her like a month ago if we could have sessions again and she said we could have ‘some sessions’ in December. This was after I told her I’d already been having a few therapist that I was very comfortable with. I agreed to the sessions. 

I knew I shouldn’t go back but I couldn’t bring myself to end it, so I emailed her a very polite email to say December is too early for me and that I’d reach out to her in the new year to let her know when I’m ready.

I didn’t get a reply back which I thought was fair enough. But I realised a couple of weeks later she has actually blocked me on WhatsApp over this.

She wanted me to be less attached and more independent, but then when I actually was she did this. I have never ever been more confused in my life.

This experience has been the most emotionally painful experience of my life, and I know it will take me years to fully heal from the experience. I have a wonderful new therapist and our sessions are practically exclusively about me processing this hurt.

I just wanted to warn people out there: if you see early red flags with a therapist, please please end it. I saw early red flags and if I’d listened to my gut, I could have saved myself so many tears.

In the beginning it was a hard adjustment.  I’m so used to self checkout, where cash isn’t allowed where I live.  So, you have to go through the “normal” cash registers.  Keep in mind, I haven’t gone through a regular till since Covid.  

Anyways, what changed is my spending habits.  Instead of blindly tapping my card, I actually found myself thinking about what I was going to buy.  And it was also nice to actually talk with people and have a conversation.  I work from home, so even when I go out in public I rarely talk with people.  I usually just do the app ordering for the coffees, use self checkout for the groceries and that company named after a river for online shopping.

The only downside was the coins! We use coins all the way to $2, then its bills (Canada).  But then again, it was nice to kinda count up and use up all the coins to get towards a medium coffee, or when I had $1.80 left, let’s get a donut or something.

I actually prefer it now.,"So, I decided to do a little challenge for myself: I’m gonna take out cash only the first of the month, and only spend cash.  No card.

In the beginning it was a hard adjustment.  I’m so used to self checkout, where cash isn’t allowed where I live.  So, you have to go through the “normal” cash registers.   Keep in mind, I haven’t gone through a regular till since Covid.  

Anyways, what changed is my spending habits.  Instead of blindly tapping my card, I actually found myself thinking about what I was going to buy.  And it was also nice to actually talk with people and have a conversation.  I work from home, so even when I go out in public I rarely talk with people.  I usually just do the app ordering for the coffees, use self checkout for the groceries and that company named after a river for online shopping.

The only downside was the coins! We use coins all the way to $2, then its bills (Canada).  But then again, it was nice to kinda count up and use up all the coins to get towards a medium coffee, or when I had $1.80 left, let’s get a donut or something.

Anyways, yeah I actually kinda like it.  It slows you down and kinda forces you to think about how much money you actually have.  When you’re counting bills in your wallet  you’re mindful that you only have X amount left to spend for the month.

Soooo, to start with, l go to the gym almost every day. For eight months, I had been going to the same gym as Johan, but I had never seen him there.
Three months ago, I noticed him and smiled at him — and that’s how we met. The next day, I saw him again, he smiled, I smiled back. After my workout, I left the gym and he was waiting for me outside. We talked a bit and then went for coffee. He told me right away that in 10 days he was flying back home to Spain. I thought it was fine and we continued talking.
We actually fell in love during those 10 days. Even though I work, I cancelled literally everything the day after we met just to spend time with him. I moved in with him for those 10 days. He was perfect — physically, our goals and values matched, and in bed he understood me without words. He did everything I wanted without me even saying it. The only downside was that he was addicted to weed. That’s a dealbreaker for me, but he didn’t smoke around me.
He promised we could continue the relationship long-distance, visit each other, etc. I really believed that and hoped for it. But literally a day after he left, he texted me saying he couldn’t do it anymore and that it was better if we stopped talking.
Oh, and I forgot to mention — we had a trip to Barcelona booked two weeks after he left. Tickets and hotel were already paid for. In the end, he told me he couldn’t see me and canceled his part.
I went alone.
It was really hard, I thought about him every damn day, but after three months I slowly started to move on.
Then, a week ago, he called me and said he missed me a lot and that he’s planning to come back in March. I didn’t believe him this time, but all the feelings came back.
And on the exact same day, a guy at the gym — Kail — approached me. We arranged a date for a week later (which happened yesterday). The whole week he tried to keep in touch, but I replied dryly and intentionally ignored him, even though he’s totally my type and I genuinely liked him.
Yesterday we had the date. First of all, I was 30 minutes late — and I knew I would be late, but for some reason I decided it wasn’t a big deal. He offered to pick me up, but I refused to get in his car and said “I don’t feel comfortable,” even though with Johan I moved in from day one, and on the second day we went on a day trip to another country in his car.
During the whole date, I was comparing him to my ex in my head. And the date was actually perfect — he wanted to pick me up, took me for cocktails, paid for everything (in the country I live in this is unusual, it’s usually 50/50), we played pool and table tennis, then we went for pizza and ate it in his car. It was really nice. But it just wasn’t my ex, and I so badly wanted to see my ex in him.
After the date, I ignored him for 2 hours and then texted my ex: “everything feels wrong without you.” He replied: “As long as I’m not there, we can’t do anything about it.” And I know he could. I was ready to travel to him. He just doesn’t want the complications.
Today I will see Kail at the gym again and I don’t know how to act. On one hand, I like him and he clearly really likes me — he’s a good guy. But I can’t imagine kissing him or starting anything romantic. It makes me feel sick. The only person I can imagine romantically or sexually is my ex. I’m terrified I’ll end up devaluing this guy, and he deserves better.
I even told him this on the date, but he said it’s okay and he’s willing to give me time to get used to him, etc.

I'm a looooong time silent reader and hope to get some different perspectives myself now. :) Overall, I'm in a rather difficult situation at the moment and I don't even know where to begin...this will be a long post. Maybe I'll try to break it up to and make different posts about different issues at some point. Maybe this is just a vent.

BACKGROUND: 

I'm living together with my NP (Tom) since the beginning of our relationship four-ish years ago (we used to just be friends/roommates). We've always been in an ""open relationship"" which I lately came to realize we understand quite differently... I have never been in a monogamous relationship and I don't have the intention to ever do so - but neither have I been in a long time committed relationship where my partner was interested in pursuing emotional connections with others just like I am (neither now with Tom nor with partners before) (there has been something here and there, but without the intention to create something more than friends with benefits, I guess).

I, on the other hand, have had crushes and have fallen in love various times (with Tom knowing & him saying it was fine - although he doesn't quite get my longing for other emotional connections outside of our relationship). The point is, those connections have always been with people that I met traveling and/or that live quite far away. It was easy for Tom to manage his emotions around that and, as I'd say now, to mostly pretend that it doesn't exist. But also, all of this obviously IS easier if it doesn't touch your day-to-day life. I think I'm pretty good at managing NRE around Tom (he says that, too) though it gets kinda hard when it comes to feelings of heartache which I really can't and don't always want to hide...

The big news is that I came to realize that those long distance relationships that I had don't satisfy my wish for connection; I more and more had the impression that those meetups were like little getaways to a small island far away from reality lol (which I also enjoyed lots for a certain time, it can surely be nice!). I don't want the people that I love to never have something to do with my day to day life.

PRESENCE:

In August I kind of started to date a person (Nick) of our mutual friend group that lives in the same city. No one saw this coming, but Nick and I went to a festival together and really hit it off. We didn't see each other much in the weeks following but kept in touch chatting. Tom said it was all fine, that it was also fine if we'd meet again and also sleep together though Tom made clear that he would prefer that my ""thing"" with Nick doesn't became a secondary relationship. I told him - which I've always told him since the beginning of our relationship - that I'm not interested in singular hookups, that I eventually will get involved emotionally but that this doesn't necessarily mean something specific regarding the type of relationship that I have with said person. This stuff has always felt really...""fluid"" for me which can make communication about this kind of difficult. 

We didn't have agreements about which people to date and who would be off limits which I now understand would have been useful. I really want to do this differently in the future and wouldn't start to date someone of our shared friend group again because I think the social implications it can have now just seem to risky for me. But here we are...

I've been working full-time now for about 1,5 years and our default style of cohabitating with Tom is that unscheduled time is time spent together (if the two of us are at home). Not in the sense that we wouldn't do other stuff, it just normally happens that way. We, especially I, have quite busy schedules regarding my social life and sports, and for him it used to be the same, but in the last few months he has been quite stressed out and busy doing stuff for work.

I've seen Nick about once a week for a ""real"" date and maybe a second time per week for a quick chat or coffee for about five weeks now. Nick has quite intense feelings for me which run reaaaaally to limerence IMO, I also feel some butterflies and I'm growling to like him a lot but my attachment feels adequate.
There have been many conversations with Tom about this in which he expressed discomfort when I met with Nick when I also could have spent time with Tom e.g. when he was at home and I could have been at home too. My dates with Nick did never take place when I had scheduled something with Tom, I wouldn't want this and I normally really enjoy the time with Tom. His discomfort is also the reason why I didn't sleep at Nick's place until now, which I would have liked to do, but didn't because I don't want to make Tom uncomfortable (he said he was sad that we couldn't spend the evening watching our series/morning drinking a coffee together then).

I also took some time off from work during the last three weeks and will probably quit my shitty ass job soon to have some time to think about what I want job/education-wise, so I actually have way more time than normal, but Tom continues to feel bad about me meeting up with Nick.

THE AGREEMENT IN QUESTION 

We now agreed on a fixed schedule and for the next few weeks I'll see Nick once a week for a date that will always be on the same day (just a date, no sleepover). The idea is to eventually ""escalate"" the agreement and also do sleepovers and some weekend-getaway. This was Tom's idea.

Nick was happy about this too as he hopes this will make it easier him as well because there's something to rely on. I feel ambivalent about this but think it's a compromise worth trying out because I hope it will give Tom time to get used to this situation and to make the experience that I still have time and energy for our relationship. On the other hand 1) I don't know if this really is the solution of the problem or if this relationship style is just not for him, but it makes sense to give it time and try everything we can; 2) I feel like I'm loosing the autonomy of my own time. I tend to think of my time with Nick just as I think about time with my best friend that I play tennis with which is really important to me and I don't ask Tom for his permission to meetup with  her. I know that it doesn't feel like this for Tom (and also I can't really say how it would feel like for myself - this might be more like an ideal in my head?).

It's exhausting. It hurts my heart to see Tom hurt but this is something that I really want. If it isn't with Nick, I'd still have those needs and wants and I feel if we don't try this out now, we'll eventually break up about this in the nearer future. I feel sad for Nick and I'm afraid that he's doing something that in the end damages him because in this situation he's so dependent on what is going on in my relationship with Tom (I've doubts that he has strong enough boundaries, but I tell him everything to be able to make informed decisions though I really try not to dump anything on him that doesn't really concern him..in the end obviously he's responsible for himself if he want to stay involved or not). In the last week I felt like it would break me apart.

Please criticize me, give me some perspective, tell me some anecdotes.

It did around 125-175 on sunny day. So i gonna buy another 4 new solar panels @ 400w each this time (not renogy), and set up a solar charge controller to keep this new lifepo4 battery topped up, esp in summer...

1osma4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1osma4s/random_notes_from_a_person_with_homeless/,Random notes from a person with homeless experience.,"regarding homelessness, every city and town’s approach to homelessness is different. They all have different resources, different priorities, different levels of success in dealing with homelessness. Not one city or town has enough resources to properly care for the homeless. To get out of homelessness, you will have to do most of the work to make it happen. You will be your own best advocate. Accept whatever help comes your way, even if it’s not completely to your liking. You don’t have the luxury of being choosy. As much as you will want a fast exit out of homelessness, it will take longer than you expect or desire. You will have to be patient with yourself and other people, especially with those you are asking for help.

Some random things to know:
Jansport backpacks are the backpacks of choice. They are very durable and are available at a fair price, buy one if you can. If you find one in donations, grab it quick. keep ONLY the bare essentials with you, one change of clothes, toiletries and health products. Don’t keep food in your back pack unless you have ziplock bags or another way to keep it sealed up. The key is to travel light. And you don’t want to appear homeless unless it’s to your advantage, such as when pan handling. A bulky backpack is a dead giveaway. If you go into a coffee shop looking and smelling like a homeless person they won’t want you hanging around, they might not even serve you.

Most coffee shops don’t have electrical outlets to charge your electrical devises, a public library is the best place to do that. Still, I have seen some fast food restaurants with outlets, though most have eliminated them because of over use and people fighting over them, so if you do find one use it discretely.

When you buy a drink at some fast food place, don’t throw the cup away. I have gotten many refills through out the day when staff wasn’t paying attention.

don’t carry around food if you can help it, eat food as you get it. Get yourself a can opener. Don’t litter! Leaving trash around is a sure way to turn the locals against you.

Setting: St. Somewhere Middle School parking lot. Morning sunlight glints off the metal of the “Faculty Vehicles Only” sign. A flock of pigeons scatter as the unmistakable rumble of the SWAT Van rolls in. It is a refurbished ambulance painted with glittering letters:

 

S.W.A.T. Seizure-Wellness-Alert-Team: “We make health happen, loudly.”

 

The side door bursts open. Tuisted hops out first, leather jacket sparkling with sequins, megaphone in hand. Caite floats out beside her, holding a clipboard, tablet, and a color-coded chart.

 

Inside the school, Mustache Man is just trying to enjoy his coffee and avoid adulthood.

 

Tuisted shout into a megaphone: “Attention, Mustache Man! This is a health intervention! Put the caffeine down and step away from the excuse list!”

 

Mustache Man step outside: “…Is this about the dentist again?”

 

Caite is cheerfully terrifying: “No. Worse. Your annual physical. The one you’ve rescheduled… six times.”

 

Mustache Man wilts: “Seven, if you count the time the fire alarm went off.”

 

Tuisted: “Excuses are just fancy ways of saying ‘I forgot my body exists!’”

 

She slams the van door dramatically. Behind her, Toaster pokes out holding a tray of cookies labeled “Positive Reinforcement.”

 

Caite floats slightly higher, voice calm:“Mustache Man, it’s not about punishment. It’s about self-maintenance. Your cholesterol can’t be intimidated into submission.”

 

Mustache Man mutters: “It worked for my students…”

 

Mustache Man sighs, twirling his handlebars: “Look, I’ll go. Eventually. I just… hate being poked, prodded, judged. You ever feel like the minute you walk in there, you’re a chart instead of a person?”

 

Everyone quiets for a second. Even Tuisted’s grin softens.

 

Tuisted: “Yeah. Every day we walk into this place. But you can’t fix what you won’t face, big guy. You’d tell a kid to go get help, wouldn’t you?”

 

He nods slowly.

 

Caite: “Then model it. You can’t teach responsibility if you won’t live it.”

 

Mustache Man groans, face in his hand:“Fine. You win. I’ll call after lunch.”

 

Tuisted’s evil grin is back: “Oh no, sweetheart. This is SWAT. We don’t leave until the mission’s complete.”

 

She grabs the phone, dials, and shoves it into his hand like a grenade.

 

Mustache Man: “…Hi, Dr. Levine’s office? Yeah, it’s me again. No, I didn’t move states. Yes, I’ll hold.”

 

Tuisted gives him a triumphant thumbs-up. Caite notes something on her clipboard.

 

Mustache Man, into his phone:“Tuesday? Yeah, Tuesday works. 2:30? Thanks.”

 

He hangs up. Caite claps. Tuisted looks like a cat who caught a mouse. Toaster bounces.

 

Tuisted: “Operation Check-Up: Success! Another life saved from the jaws of procrastination!”

 

Mustache Man shakes his head, a smile tugging at his lips: “You people are insane.”

 

Caite: “Clinically motivated, actually.”

 

Toaster beams: “Cookie?”

 

He takes one, smile fully bloomed: “Guess this is what accountability tastes like.”

 

Tuisted claps him on the back: “Exactly. Sugary, supportive, and slightly terrifying.”

 

They pile back into the SWAT van as Mustache Man head back to work.

 

Caite: “Where to next?”

 

Tuisted: “Wherever there’s denial, bad snacks, and overdue lab work.”",2,1762702413.0,Epilepsy_Universe,1,1.0,False

While I wait on partials and fulls for my latest MS, I decided to work on something else and ended up with this project. I tried posting here a couple of weeks about the genre, but it got taken down. I was told I had to attach my question to a query, so here it is:

I was talking to a friend about how I wanted to write something fun and cozy next (this project) and this friend flatout said I should move away from cozy fantasy because the genre is reaching saturation. Is this true? I love this project and it would be a bummer to have to shelf it because of market reasons. And yes, I know that you should write the book of your heart and all that, but you can't ignore shifts in market either imo.

Anyway, thanks for any and all feedback. Here's the query:

Dear \[AGENT NAME\],

EVERYDAY MAGIC is a 80,000-word Adult novel that blends Contemporary and cozy fantasy. It’s pitched as “*Kiki’s Delivery Service* meets *Amélie*” and will resonate with fans of Studio Ghibli films and *The House in the Cerulean Sea* by TJ Klune. I’m submitting to you because \[personalized reason\]. As requested, I’ve added \[sample pages and/or outline\] to this email/form.

There’s nothing special about Mel Greco — and that’s a big problem. Mel’s family is magical, but every now and then power skips someone. When a Greco without magic turns 21, they have a choice to make: either live under the tutelage of their magical parent or abandon the family. If they stay, they’ll forfeit every choice, down to their clothes and meals, and do whatever their magical parent decides is best. If they leave, they’ll be free to choose their own path, but forfeit all memories of family and magic. And this is the choice Mel will have to make.

Mel decides to leave early and spare herself and her family the heartache of waiting another year. Obviously, her parents and sister don’t want that. So they propose a deal: she’ll go and live on her own for the year before she turns twenty one. *Life on training wheels*, Mom calls it. Only then she can make an informed decision.

Mel accepts and moves to a seaside town called Silvana. It’s the sort of place she believes is void of magic and just what she needs. But much to her surprise, Mel finds a different kind of magic there. It’s the magic of an old favorite song coming up on the radio and of cooking with a dear friend. Of the rich scent of coffee first thing in the morning. And of first kisses under star-studded skies.

As the days pass, Mel feels more and more torn between the family she adores and the found family she’s building for herself. There’s only one thing she is sure of: she might be done with magic, but maybe magic isn’t done with her.

He never has his phone out. Doesn't read anything. Just eats and looks around. Takes him maybe twenty minutes.

When he's done he closes the container, closes his door, and drives away.

It's not creepy or anything. Just interesting. Like he's taking an actual break. Not trying to multitask or squeeze productivity out of his lunch hour. Just existing in his car, eating his spaghetti, looking at trees.

I (F47) love snow. We got our first snowfall of the year today. I’ve been looking forward to the little snowflake on my weather app all week. This *should* also be my husband’s (M51) last Sunday morning off for a long time, as he starts a new job this week that will require him to be there. With all that in mind I made fresh cinnamon rolls and coffee this morning thinking I’d make a nice cozy Sunday morning for us after we walked the dog. ☺️ The rolls aren’t scratch-baked but they’re a frozen take-n-bake tray that required me getting up at around 4:30AM to pull them out to thaw for an hour before going into the oven. 
The house was warm and smelled AMAZING by like 6:00AM.

He came downstairs scowling about the weather, walked right past the warm cinnamon buns without a word then proceeded to tell me how I probably didn’t make the coffee right. I was hurt by the utter lack of appreciation.

This turned into an argument which in turn became a full on fight. He took off mid dog walk to go home. The dog spent the rest of the walk stopping to look behind us basically every other house length to see where he went which just made me feel even shittier. I had to practically pull her down the street for a while just to get us back home.

*I* say this was me trying to be thoughtful and put effort toward having a good Sunday morning together and, while I don’t expect a standing ovation, I did expect a little appreciation and for him to understand by now that that’s my “love language.” This has been discussed at length so it shouldn’t be news.

He says that I did it because I wanted him to come downstairs and fall all over himself validating me which actually makes it a *selfish* act. 

SO… no one’s enjoying cinnamon buns, the house is icy instead of cozy and he’s upstairs doing whatever he does up there while I’m trying to get ready and get outta the house as quickly as possible and avoid any more back and forth until heads cool down.

So Reddit, AITA for anticipating a more positive response? Does expecting a little appreciation for doing something sweet make it a self-serving act?

**Editing to add- he said the coffee thing with a tiny bit of a smirk and probably meant it to be somewhat funny. He just made coffee yesterday that was perfect (brewed exactly right for me) and I kinda gushed about it because it just hit right in that moment and I generally make it too strong or (when I try to course correct) too weak. The joke didn’t land well for me since I was already feeling a bit let down.

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. IT OFFICE – MORNING**

Joe sits at his cluttered desk, sipping coffee and looking at a support ticket on his screen:

“Install Microsoft Teams on Victor’s workstation.”

He stares at it like it’s a mission to Mars.

**JOE (muttering)**  
Install… Teams. Plural. So, like, more than one app?

His coworker **GINA** walks by.

**GINA**  
Morning, Joe. What’s on your list today?

**JOE**  
I gotta install ‘Teams’ for Victor. Ever heard of it?

**GINA**  
You mean the meeting app?

**JOE**  
Meeting app… yeah, that sounds right. Do you… install it, or does it, like, install *you*?

**GINA**  
It’s just software, Joe.

**JOE**  
Oh good, I was worried it was one of those cloud things.

Cut to opening theme.



**ACT ONE**

**INT. IT OFFICE – 10:00 A.M.**

Joe spins in his chair, staring at the screen.  
He picks up the phone and calls his coworker **RAJ**, the senior tech.

**JOE**  
Hey Raj, question: for installing Teams, do you think I should remote into Victor’s computer… or just walk over?

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
How far away is Victor?

**JOE**  
Uh… one door.

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
Then walk, Joe.

**JOE**  
Right. Right. Exercise. Builds team spirit.

Joe grabs a USB drive (completely unnecessary) and marches proudly to Victor’s desk.



**INT. VICTOR’S OFFICE – LATER**

Victor, a polite but impatient coworker, looks up as Joe arrives.

**VICTOR**  
Hey Joe. Thanks for coming. It just says I don’t have Teams installed.

**JOE**  
No problem, Victor. I’m kind of a Teams expert now.

He opens the browser, types “How to install Teams,” and immediately gets lost in Microsoft documentation.

**JOE**  
Wow, this is… a lot of steps. Do you, uh, happen to have the internet password?

**VICTOR**  
You’re literally using the internet right now.

**JOE**  
Ah. Great! That means it’s working already.



**ACT TWO**

Joe calls Raj *again* from Victor’s desk.

**JOE**  
Hey Raj, quick update: we’re on step three of… seven hundred. It’s asking for a login. Do I use my account or Victor’s?

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
You’re installing it on *Victor’s* computer, right?

**JOE**  
Right.

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
Then use *Victor’s* account.

**JOE**  
Makes sense. But if I log in with his account, does that make me *Victor*?

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
No, Joe. It makes you done with this ticket.

**JOE**  
Copy that. Becoming Victor now.

He logs in with Victor’s account. Teams launches successfully. Victor claps politely.

**VICTOR**  
Thanks, Joe. That took a while.

**JOE**  
Hey, can’t rush quality.



**CUT TO:**

**INT. HALLWAY – 11:50 A.M.**

Joe struts back to his desk like he just closed a multi-million-dollar deal.

**GINA**  
So?

**JOE**  
Mission accomplished. Installed Teams. Logged in. Flawless execution.

**GINA**  
Wow, that took… what, three hours?

**JOE**  
Precision takes time, Gina. You can’t rush greatness.

She glances at the clock: **11:59.**

**GINA**  
Just in time for lunch, huh?

**JOE**  
Exactly as planned.



**ACT THREE**

**INT. IT OFFICE – 12:30 P.M.**

Joe sits at his desk, eating his sandwich, proudly updating his ticket log:

“Resolved: Installed Teams successfully.”  
*Total time spent: 3 hours, 7 minutes.*

His boss, **TOM**, walks by.

**TOM**  
Joe… three hours for one install?

**JOE**  
Hey, we don’t call it “Microsoft Singles,” do we? Took a whole team effort.

Tom just stares, speechless.

**GINA**  
(quietly to Tom)  
What can you do?

**TOM (resigned)**  
It’s Joe.

Joe leans back, takes a bite of his sandwich, and smiles proudly at his screen.

**JOE**  
Another productive morning.



**TAG SCENE**

**INT. IT OFFICE – NEXT DAY**

Joe’s phone rings.

**VICTOR (O.S.)**  
Hey Joe, Teams isn’t opening this morning.

**JOE**  
Oh no problem, Victor, I’ll send Raj over.

**RAJ (O.S.)**  
Joe! You’re literally one door away!

**JOE**  
Exactly. Teamwork.

Cue laugh track and fade out.

We currently have an 8 y/o (my son from a previous relationship) and I’m 9 months pregnant with our second. My boyfriend comes from a family that isn’t very health conscious, especially when it comes to diet. He was allowed to drink soda and COFFEE daily from elementary school  age, there wasn’t a lot of fresh fruit and veggies in the house, not prioritizing drinking water and things like that. I, however was raised by parents that ensured we drank enough water, had fruits or veggies with every meal and didn’t overdo it on snacks or sodas. So the current problem is that we fight about our 8 year old’s eating habits and I don’t want it to carry over to this next baby. For example, I let our son have one soda once a week. Boyfriend thinks this is outrageous and I should let him have one whenever he wants because “kids are brand new and it doesn’t affect them negatively”. He says our son would not act so wound up when he does get sodas if we let him have it more often. When I make dinners with vegetables, he always makes a comment about how it would taste better if there weren’t any in the meal. These comments influenced our son stop eating broccoli for a period of time. I’ve tried to explain to him several times how important it is so that they carry these habits into their adult lives but nothing seems to make him understand. He was just talking about how it’s completely normal to give 6 month old babies juice and it’s not at all. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get this through to him? I’m really worried about leaving him alone with our baby in the future because I don’t think he’ll follow nutritional guidelines. It’s very upsetting because it makes me feel that he doesn’t want to prioritize our children’s health. ",0,1762701782.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False

1oslyup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Laptop/comments/1oslyup/water_spilled_on_dell_laptop/,Water spilled on Dell laptop,"Hi all,

My coffee table has a shelve underneath the top, and the top is cracked.

Earlier today, I had a waterbottle on the top of the table. At some point I realised that the bottle leaked, took the bottle away and cleaned the water on the top, not even thinking about my laptop on the shelve underneath. It didn't look like a big mess, but I have no time frame of when I put the bottle down there, or how much it leaked. I just always have a bottle of water near me and refill it when it's empty.

About 2 hours after I realised that the bottle had a leak, I wanted to use my laptop, and discovered that water leaked through the crack on the top.

This whole time, the laptop was on sleep mode, closed, but plugged in.

When I started the laptop, I heard a faint tik-tik sound. It did start up, though.

I mentioned the sound to my husband and when he took the laptop to listen, he tilted it, and we discovered it got wet.

We immediately turned it off, unplugged it and took the battery out.

I've had it angled in all possible positions to try and drain any water that might be inside, but what do I do now?

I have a f'ing huge meating tomorrow morning, and I'm about to have a nervous breakdown!

Here’s what helps.","I've been seeing this a lot lately. People say they’re “outgoing” or “extroverted” deep down, but then freeze up in real life. Want to connect, but avoid eye contact. Crave stimulating conversations, but feel sick before social plans. It’s like your soul wants to party, but your nervous system wants to hide under the bed. And what’s wild is, this isn’t just a “you” problem. It’s happening all around us, especially with our generation.

Social anxiety mixed with extroverted personality traits is way more common than people think. Research backs it. According to the *Journal of Abnormal Psychology*, about 15% of people with social anxiety actually self-identify as high in extraversion traits. So you’re not imagining it.

This post is a deep dive into why this happens and what actually helps. Not TikTok-level “just be confident xoxo” advice. This is from books, neuroscience, therapists, and behavioral psychology research. Also, there’s way too much BS out there from clout-chasing influencers who don’t know what they’re talking about. So let’s break it down properly.

---

*Here’s why your brain feels like a contradiction:*

* **Your biology and personality may not be aligned.** Extroversion is about energy. You feel recharged by being around others. But social anxiety is a fear response. According to Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, clinical psychologist and author of *How to Be Yourself*, this combo leads to “approach-avoidance conflict,” where you want to engage but your fear system hits the brakes. It’s like internal whiplash.
* **Social trauma rewires your response to connection.** Even a few bad experiences, getting laughed at, being rejected, public embarrassment, can train the amygdala (your brain’s fear center) to panic in similar situations. Psychologists call this “social conditioning.” Over time, you might start avoiding what you actually enjoy.
* **Modern life is making this worse.** Algorithms reward performative confidence, not real connection. Constant comparison on social media is shown to increase social anxiety, especially in extroverted personalities, according to a 2022 study published in *Computers in Human Behavior*. Basically, you’re more likely to feel “behind” if you crave connection but don’t post like a micro-influencer.

---

*Here’s what actually helps (and it’s not “fake it till you make it”):*

* **Start with controlled exposure, not avoidance.**
   * According to Dr. David Carbonell (*The Anxiety Coach*), avoidance reinforces anxiety. Instead, try “exposure stacking.” Start with low-stakes conversations (coffee shop small talk, saying hi to a neighbor) and track how your anxiety peaks and then drops. This teaches your brain it’s safe.
   * Try the “one conversation a day” challenge. Keep it casual. Get reps in.
* **Rewrite social scripts before the event.**
   * Socially anxious extroverts usually overthink *how* to act. Prepping a few conversation starters or even writing a “social map” can be huge. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco (author of *Platonic*) recommends mentally rehearsing positive outcomes rather than worst-case scenarios.
   * Plan your exits too. Knowing you can leave at any time lowers anxiety.
* **Train your nervous system, not just your mindset.**
   * Breathwork helps, but not the trendy kind. Use *physiological sighs*, two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) says this is the fastest way to calm real-time anxiety.
   * Do it 2-3 times before going out. It’s like a manual override for anxiety.

---

*Here are some insanely good resources I wish I found earlier:*

* **Book: *****How to Be Yourself***** by Dr. Ellen Hendriksen**
   * Absolute must-read. Written by a clinical psychologist, this book is based on years of treating socially anxious clients who didn’t “look” socially anxious. It’s packed with science-backed strategies and real examples.
   * What makes it unique? It doesn’t ask you to change your personality. It helps remove the fear *blocking* your real self.
   * Seriously, top 3 psych books I’ve ever read. You’ll probably cry by page 40, in a good way.
* **Book: *****The Power of Regret***** by Daniel Pink**
   * This book changed how I think about missed social chances. Pink shows how regret isn’t useless, it can actually guide better decision-making and reduce future anxiety.
   * If you find yourself obsessing over what you *should’ve said* or *should’ve done*, this book is for you.
   * Pink is a 5x NYT bestselling author. This one hits different.
* **Podcast: *****The Science of Happiness***** (Greater Good Science Center)**
   * Backed by UC Berkeley, this podcast gives bite-sized, research-backed tools to boost social confidence and emotional regulation.
   * Favorite episode: “How to Be a Better Conversationalist” with neuroscientist Emiliana Simon-Thomas. 20 minutes, packed with gold.
* **YouTube: Kati Morton (licensed therapist)**
   * She breaks down social anxiety, rejection sensitivity, and self-doubt in a way that’s honest but not preachy.
   * Best video to start with: “When You Want Friends But Have Social Anxiety.” It’s been viewed over 1M times for a reason.
   * She also gives scripts you can actually use in real life. Not just theory.
* **App: Finch**
   * It’s a gamified self-care tracker that lets you set micro-social goals. Like “text one friend” or “compliment a stranger.”
   * It also tracks your mood and gives affirmations that don’t sound like they were written by a robot.
   * Great option if your anxiety makes consistency hard.
* **App: MasterClass**
   * Honestly underrated for social skills. The class by Robin Roberts (yes, the *GMA* host) on communication and confidence was a game-changer.
   * It’s not just for public speaking. She teaches how to be real, vulnerable, and magnetic in everyday interactions.
   * Also, you feel like you’re learning from a wise aunt who actually gets it.
* **BeFreed: an adaptive AI-powered learning app built by a Columbia University team**
   * It turns books, expert talks, and neuroscience findings into customized audio lessons based on what you want to work on, like social connection, confidence, or anxiety.
   * You pick the length of the episode (10, 20, 40 min) and even the voice tone. I chose a calm, sarcastic host voice.
   * It tracks what you absorb and builds a personalized learning plan over time. It’s perfect for when you want deep psychological tools but don’t have time to read 10 books.
   * Especially useful if your brain needs short, digestible tips on-the-go instead of long lectures.

If this post hit a nerve, then yeah. You’re not alone in this weird in-between feeling. You’re not “broken.” Your extroversion isn’t fake just because anxiety hijacks it sometimes. Your real self is in there. It just needs better armor, not reinvention.",1,1762701453.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

A grimy, batter-caked waffle iron staring back at you, promising ten minutes of awkward, water-fearing scrubbing with a damp cloth. For years, I just accepted this as the price of delicious waffles. But it's not.

If you’ve ever dreaded the cleanup part of waffle making, this post is for you. The single best innovation in breakfast appliances in a long time isn't a smarter toaster or a fancier coffee machine—it's the simple, brilliant **waffle iron with removable plates**. This isn't just a minor convenience; it's a game-changer that changes how you use, clean, and store one of the most beloved kitchen gadgets.

Let's break down why this feature is an absolute must-have and what to look for when you finally decide to upgrade.

## Why Removable Plates Are a Total Game-Changer

Moving from a traditional unit to one with removable plates is like going from a flip phone to a smartphone. You didn't know what you were missing, but now you can't imagine going back.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=waffle%20iron%20with%20removable%20plates)

### 1. Effortless, Actually-Genuinely-Easy Cleaning

This is the number one reason, full stop.

-   **Dishwasher Safe:** The best removable waffle plates are **dishwasher safe**. You just pop them out, toss them in with the rest of your dishes, and you're done. No more delicate wiping, no more worrying about getting water in the electronics.
-   **No More Nooks and Crannies:** Batter gets everywhere. With fixed plates, you're fighting with tight corners and deep grids. Removable plates give you full access to every single surface, so a quick rinse or a run through the dishwasher gets them perfectly clean.
-   **Preserves the Non-Stick Coating:** Scrubbing at fixed plates with abrasive tools can wear down the non-stick surface over time. Gentle dishwasher cleaning is far kinder, extending the life and performance of your appliance.

### 2. Incredible Versatility Saves Space and Money

This is the secret weapon you didn't know you needed. Most waffle makers with removable plates aren't just waffle makers. They're multi-functional cooking systems. The plates are **interchangeable**, meaning you can swap out the waffle grid for:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=waffle%20iron%20with%20removable%20plates)

-   **Flat Griddle Plates:** Perfect for pancakes, eggs, bacon, or grilled cheese.
-   **Grill Plates:** Think paninis, quesadillas, grilled vegetables, or even searing a small steak.
-   **Sandwich Plates:** Deep-pocketed plates designed to seal the edges of a perfect toasted sandwich.

Instead of cluttering your cabinets with three separate single-use appliances, you have one compact machine that does it all. For anyone with a small kitchen or a minimalist mindset, this is pure magic.

### 3. Superior Cooking and Storage

Because the plates are separate, they often heat more evenly and make direct contact with the heating element. Plus, storage becomes a dream. Many models allow you to store the plates right inside the main unit, or nest them together, creating a much smaller footprint than a traditional, awkwardly shaped waffle iron.

## Choosing Your New Kitchen MVP: What to Look For

Ready to take the plunge? Here’s a quick checklist to find the perfect **waffle iron with removable plates** for your kitchen.

1.  **Plate Variety:** Decide what you'll use most. Do you just want waffles and grilled cheese? A 3-in-1 model is great. If you want to do more grilling and searing, look for a 5-in-1 or more robust system.
2.  **Temperature Control:** Don't settle for a simple ""on/off"" switch. A good model will have adjustable temperature settings. Different foods require different heat levels—delicate waffles need lower heat than a crispy panini.
3.  **Build Quality:** Look for a solid feel. Stainless steel housings tend to be more durable and retain heat better than all-plastic models. Check that the plates lock securely into place with a satisfying *click*.
4.  **Indicator Lights:** Clear ""power on"" and ""ready to cook"" lights are essential for knowing when your appliance is preheated and when your food is done.

## A True Kitchen Workhorse I Genuinely Love

For a long time, I was skeptical of these ""all-in-one"" gadgets. They often feel like a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But then I found a high-quality model with a heavy-duty feel and five different plate sets: Belgian waffle, classic waffle, griddle, grill, and a unique waffle cone plate.

This thing has become the unsung hero of my kitchen. The waffles are consistently deep and golden. The grill plates make the best, crunchiest paninis I've ever had at home. And being able to just pop the greasy grill plates into the dishwasher after making burgers? It's a level of convenience I genuinely didn't think was possible. It’s the kind of tool I wish I’d found a decade ago—it would have saved me so much time and cabinet space.

## The Final Verdict

Investing in a **waffle iron with removable plates** isn't just about buying a new appliance. It's about buying back your time, simplifying your kitchen cleanup, and unlocking a world of versatile cooking possibilities.

You get the joy of perfect waffles without the dread of the cleanup. You get a multi-function tool that replaces clutter and inspires new meals. And you get the freedom to truly enjoy cooking, from start to finish. If you're still wrestling with an old-school, fixed-plate waffle maker, do yourself a favor and make the switch.

To No One in Particular
(A Gaslight Diaries Story)

She was destined to live a hard life. Born into a family that was already broken and bleeding. The walls of her childhood home were thin, but not thin enough to let the light in — only the sound of things falling apart. A mother who cried into her hands, a father who drank until he forgot what year it was. The air was heavy with things unsaid, a silence that pressed down like a hand over her mouth.

By eight, she had already learned to hide her tears. By twelve, she had stopped expecting anyone to notice. Her world was made of shadows and half-heard apologies, the smell of cheap whiskey, and the metallic sting of loneliness.

She grew up chasing small escapes — a library corner, a cracked window, the hum of a radio that played songs about lives that seemed possible only somewhere else. But no matter how far she tried to run, she always ended up in rooms that felt like her old house — too quiet, too cold, too full of ghosts.

Love, when it came, was only another storm. She mistook the chaos for warmth, the cruelty for passion. Every time she tried to build something, it slipped through her fingers like dust. Every man she met had her father’s eyes, her mother’s silence.

Years passed. She learned to live on the edges of things — not quite seen, not quite forgotten. A ghost in her own life. The people around her said she was strong, as if survival were something to envy. But there was nothing left inside her worth saving; only echoes of who she might’ve been, if someone had held her differently.

When she finally disappeared — a quiet exit, a note that said nothing at all — no one was surprised. Some said they’d seen it coming. Others didn’t notice she was gone until the mail piled up and the lights went dark.

It was the landlord who found her. Three weeks late on rent, the smell had started to drift into the hallway — faint at first, like damp wood, then heavier, thicker, until it couldn’t be ignored. He knocked three times before opening the door, calling her name into the silence that had already forgotten her.

The room was small, barely furnished. A single lamp, an unmade bed, a coffee cup half-full and growing mold at the bottom. The note sat on the table, folded neatly, her name written across it — to no one in particular.

The police came and went. The neighbors whispered, then moved on. Someone mentioned she used to smile, that she’d been “quiet but polite.” Someone else said she’d always seemed lonely. That word again — lonely — like it explained everything, like it was small enough to hold the weight she carried.

Her things were boxed up and sent to no one. The few photographs she owned — a childhood face in a torn dress, a blurry shot of a man whose arm she almost trusted — ended up in the trash behind the building.

Weeks later, a janitor cleaning out the dumpster found the note. It had slipped between the pages of an old paperback. The paper was stained, the ink smudged, but the words were still legible.

It said only this:

“I was never trying to be saved. I just wanted the noise to stop.”

And that was all. No name, no reason, no plea for understanding. Just the final sentence of a life that had been written in silence from the start.

When the janitor folded the note back up, he hesitated — not sure whether to throw it away or keep it. In the end, he put it in his pocket, not knowing why. That night, he dreamed of her — standing in a room with no walls, looking finally at peace, or maybe just gone.

The world kept spinning, the seasons changed, and her name faded like breath on glass. But somewhere, in the pocket of a stranger’s jacket, the last trace of her remained — a whisper of a girl who had lived quietly, loved badly, and left softly.

Outside her window, it began to rain the next morning — slow, deliberate rain that sounded almost like breathing. It fell through the cracked roof, down the walls she once leaned against, and pooled beneath the chair where she used to sit. The water gathered around her last cigarette, her last half-written thought, her last trace of warmth. By evening, the room was empty again, washed clean of her — except for a single red thread that had caught on the nail by the door, trembling with every draft.

No one ever knew where it came from, or why it stayed when everything else had gone. But sometimes, when the wind moved through the hallway just right, that thread would stir — as if remembering her, as if refusing to let the world forget that once, someone had lived there, and had tried so very hard to stay.",1,1762701086.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False
1oslquy,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaexpressentry/comments/1oslquy/close_to_an_year_of_studying_and_i_finally_passed/,Close to an year of studying and I finally passed my TEF Canada exam (Study timeline + what worked for me),"Approx 10.5-11 months of studying. Started last October but I took 2 long breaks.

Here’s roughly how I studied:

Classes & Levels
I worked with a private tutor from Cameroon, a native French speaker. We covered A1 to B1 completely, and then did B2 grammar and selected lessons from the Édito B2 book.

Once I started B2, I also began learning fait divers and Section B (Expression Orale) slowly, without rushing. I used ChatGPT a lot to find the right words, correct grammar mistakes, and understand every single error.

1️⃣Speaking (Section B)
I began by writing everything first, then practicing them aloud. My teacher would give me a topic, I’d write my answer, and we’d practice it orally in the next class.

I learned to ask questions properly (starting from A2–B1 level) and then moved on to asking more specific, natural ones.

2️⃣Writing
I wrote around 60–70 texts on different topics on Google docs. I had this saved so I could read and re-read every once in a while (all corrected and reviewed) 

Process - At first, I made a lot of mistakes, but my teacher corrected everything and helped me learn structure (what to write in paragraph 1 vs paragraph 2, etc.).

Later, most of my progress came from writing again and again, using ChatGPT to review every text, and reading fait divers on Le Parisien and France 24.

 “FD Correction Method” 
I created something I called the FD correction method (named after fait divers - which is what I initially used this for):

So once I wrote, I put it on ChatGPT and asked it to use the FD correction method 
	•	Step 1: Highlight errors and put corrections in brackets
	•	Step 2: Explain mistakes
	•	Step 3: Give corrected version
	•	Step 4: Provide a B2-level improved version

I used this method for everything later — writing, speaking scripts, even grammar exercises.

For Section B, I used a simple template for the intro and conclusion, and tried to make my arguments nuanced — not just completely “for” or “against”.

3️⃣Listening
I practiced mainly with RFI – Français Facile to start with 
My method:
	1.	Listen without transcript
	2.	Then with transcript
	3.	Translate line by line to fully understand
	4.	Listen again without transcript to check progress

I also listened to many podcasts: Inner French, French Baratin, Le français avec fluidité, Coffee Break French, Radio Canada, Huit milliards de voisins, and Journal en français facile.

4️⃣Reading
Mostly mock tests and PrepMyFuture, but I also read transcripts of my listening exercises — that was my main reading practice.

Extra resources and info 

At first, I practiced using ChatGPT’s text-to-speech, and later I started doing live chats to improve fluency.

Towards the end, I practiced with 2–3 other learners at my level, and after my first attempt in July, I worked with 3 more teachers besides my main tutor:
	•	One from Alliance Française who helped assess my level and gave me some tips to improve my score in speaking 
	•	Another who gave me more topic practice & ideas 
	•	And one who focused on pronunciation

I used Raston’s EO book for TEF topics and ideas and developed my own answers. 

I also used the hachette book for listening. Raston’s CO but it isn’t great. 

Prepmyfuture for all sections 

Watched multiple YouTube videos throughout my learning. And did lots of mock tests starting june till my 2nd exam in October. 
____________________

TIP - something no one told me early on - start learning how to write as soon as you can. Write on ChatGPT and keep correcting and learning to improve. 
Use ChatGPT not just as a search tool but train it with different methods and it’ll be such a huge help later. 

Also, make lists of expressions and categorise vocab you can use in EO and EE separately. Maintain a document of all your writings and keep reading, reviewing and upgrading the level of your writing every now and then. 

In the earlier stages too, I made lists of vocab- expressions, grammar rules, words I thought were important for each lesson. 
____________________

I’d like to thank a bunch of people here who helped me by answering to my questions on DMs,  comments and their experiences and doubts here on Reddit. 

Hope this helps. If you have questions, ask me or need more info, lmk and I’ll try to answer as best as I can :)

1oslpzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/qmg/comments/1oslpzr/when_they_go_deaf_at_the_word_kurd/,When They Go Deaf at the Word “Kurd”!,"

During a televised interview, the actress Mona Wassef spoke clearly and confidently: “My name is Mona Chilmeiran. I’m a Kurd from Mosul!”

And in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee, Iraqi social media lit up like someone had found treasure in their backyard. Enthusiastic posts declared: “Mona Wassef admits she’s Iraqi!”

Suddenly, the word “Kurd” vanished from the scene like water evaporating on a hot pan. It was as if their ears had gone deaf at that moment—or as if “Kurd” was an unwelcome guest they decided to kick out of the wedding. For them, original identity is like yogurt in the sun… it spoils quickly and gets repackaged with a label that reads “Made in Iraq,” courtesy of the Facebook narrative.

Then came the American scientist, speaking to the world’s media: “We discovered a Neanderthal skeleton in Kurdistan!”
But the moment the news reached their ears, it instantly transformed into: “The oldest Neanderthal skeleton found in Iraq!”
Kurdistan became invisible ink—disappearing under the light of nationalism. Scientific facts turned into café gossip, reshaped to fit the mood. Geography became a chessboard, rearranged at will.

Next scene: Dr. Azad Najjar from Zakho, inventor of the artificial heart in Sweden.
He appeared on TV speaking Kurdish, proudly declaring: “I am Kurdish and proud of it.”

Yet within seconds—like a 100-meter sprint—they had rebranded him as an “Arab Iraqi”!
Maybe they thought his language was an alien dialect of Arabic, or that pride in Kurdish identity was a spelling mistake needing urgent nationalist correction.

And the disaster struck when they learned that Ahmed Shawqi, their prince of poetry, was of Kurdish origin.
They couldn’t handle the shock. They sat at the dissection table and said: “Yes, he’s Kurdish… but his mother was Turkish, his grandmother Armenian, and his great-grandmother Greek…”

They left us with crumbs of Kurdishness—barely visible under a microscope!

But if, God forbid, a Kurdish person commits a mistake anywhere in the world…
Then suddenly he becomes “Kurdish son of a Kurd from Kurdistan, from such-and-such village.”

They’ll dig up his great-grandfather’s grave to paint him as a vampire.
And if they could, they’d plaster his photo across every newspaper!

This isn’t a passing scene—it’s an old series that’s been running since the Abbasid era.
Everything created or discovered by non-Arab ethnicities or indigenous civilizations gets rushed into the Arabization chamber, emerging with a new name and a new birthdate.
And as always, the ending is the same: “They’re all from the tents of Quraysh and Banu Qaynuqa.”
It’s as if they have a Ministry of Erasure and Reassignment, working in shifts—from archaeology to alphabets, from medicine to epics.
Same machine, same result: your achievements suddenly become products of the tent, while historical truth screams like a living corpse being buried alive.

1oslp3w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oslp3w,Baby torbie update!,"Hi everyone! 
Just wanted to share some new updates on the baby. She's eating a lot and growing fast. She's now about 620 grams total (up from 270 g when the vet first saw her) and we assume she's 6 weeks old--so her growth rate and learning and behavior habits are right on time.

She's started grooming and is zooming around the room a ton. She loves to play hide and seek. She's also very curious and bright eyed and taking the world in. 

We had her in a large playpen while we were tacking her fleas but now she's flea free so we're letting her roam a few rooms and she's loving to run around and explore. 

She'll zoom for a bit and want to play and then she'll nod of for 30 min or so. She loves sleeping under my husband's arm or in the curtains. She loves to play and she always rolls on her back and wants us to pet her belly spots. She's done this since day one when we got her about 3 weeks ago. 

She's getting stronger everyday and she's playbiting and kicking a lot - - which I know is normal. so I'm gently teaching her boundaries. if she bites too hard, I stop playing. Let's see how this goes. 

She's started jumping more like from the couch to the floor or to the coffee table. It's funny to watch her size up the jumps and then tell herself OK I can do it and boom. Then she's goes. She does the kitty side winder as I call it when she plays. And she's watching things on our big TV. Her eyes get so large and wide and you can see the wonder in her expression. She's also started smiling. 

She has a lot of expressions and a very expressive face which I'm finding magical to see. I feel like I'm learning to see the world in new ways through her wonder. 

I find her to be a mix of smart funny sassy inquisitive and also very loving. And I'm enjoying being a new torbie parent! 

What interesting unique and all around awesome cats!

I agree with everyone about Requip/Ropinerole...I augmented at 4mg, I've been titrated down to 1mg, and I should be off soon.
I was also told to stop taking hydroxyzine because that can exacerbate RLS as well.
I had seen caffeine can cause a problem, but honestly, I don't have a problem with caffeine consumption. I'm usually done with coffee by 1 pm.
Hydration is super important and i sorely lack in that department.
And I'm mad, but it makes sense....sugar. Sugar makes it so much worse.
Thursday I made a lemon meringue pie. Had a piece that night and my legs were driving me up the wall.
Didn't have any on Friday, and my legs were fine-ish, not as bad. Had a piece yesterday afternoon around 2 pm...my God...my legs started jerking and creepy crawling about 30 minutes after I had it.
While I know I need to stop sugar consumption and lose weight, this is just sad.
The whole time it was most likely sugar consumption and dehydration.
The Requip I started because I was on Latuda for Bipolar depression (which I never had), and the adverse effect was RLS. So the wrong medication gave me this horrible disease forever. Thanks, crappy psych doctor.
But I'm on gabapentin, 100mg. Just started last Tuesday.
While coming off the Requip and hydroxyzine can potentially make the symptoms worse temporarily, cutting out the sugar may help me where the gabapentin might be all I need.
And yes I read you can augment on gabapentin too and the last result is opioid.
I see a neurologist in January who specializes in movement disorders and has a very high recommendation to see for it. 
I have hopes this can get under control 
The RLS causes insomnia, and you need sleep to keep RLS calm. A nice catch-22.
Thanks everyone for the input and your stories.

(A Gaslight Diaries Story)

She was destined to live a hard life. Born into a family that was already broken and bleeding. The walls of her childhood home were thin, but not thin enough to let the light in — only the sound of things falling apart. A mother who cried into her hands, a father who drank until he forgot what year it was. The air was heavy with things unsaid, a silence that pressed down like a hand over her mouth.

By eight, she had already learned to hide her tears. By twelve, she had stopped expecting anyone to notice. Her world was made of shadows and half-heard apologies, the smell of cheap whiskey, and the metallic sting of loneliness.

She grew up chasing small escapes — a library corner, a cracked window, the hum of a radio that played songs about lives that seemed possible only somewhere else. But no matter how far she tried to run, she always ended up in rooms that felt like her old house — too quiet, too cold, too full of ghosts.

Love, when it came, was only another storm. She mistook the chaos for warmth, the cruelty for passion. Every time she tried to build something, it slipped through her fingers like dust. Every man she met had her father’s eyes, her mother’s silence.

Long story short I met up with a guy at a coffee shop. We chatted a bit. We worked on our individual projects and it was OK and then we walked in a pretty neighbourhood and found a park with a lot of kids running around and parents. We found a bench no one was around but still people were close by not enough to hear but to see. We kissed which I told him I was fine with, but then he was touching me. He was touching my chest And I told him I’m not OK with that but he did it. I stepped back and I called him out.

“What are you doing?” He said “I’m checking” “checking what” “boobs” he replied. He told me I need to go with the flow. Again, I step back and said “is it OK for you to meet a girl off the street and touch her tits in public?” He said he was done with me and walked away…. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened almost every single guy has touched me inappropriately without asking my consent after I made it very well known I’m not OK with it. I’m not exaggerating. I’m plus size. I have a large chest, but I do everything right I send my location to friends. I send pictures of a guy. I called the guy on the phone to see if we even match our vibes and we meet in public, but it seems to happen a lot. 

I know men suck, but can anyone give me advice of what else I can do to keep myself safe at this point I’m thinking I need to just bring a whole friend to the date. 

My profile is okay I have face pics and full body pics to show I’m plus size nothing is showing no skin no bikini pics. I make it clear in my bio I want a boyfriend.

Didn't say anything to him just smiled and laughed. One of my coworkers had a hot coffee in her hand and almost spilt it on him. But its the worst in the drive thru. It astounds me how these parents let their kids talk to them so demandingly and disrespectfully, and even when they tell them to stop they dont listen.

Planning is just one part of being proactive. There are other proactive principles that guide behavior, mindset, and response.

Here are core proactive principles that actually matter in real life:

1. Take Responsibility Before Blame

Proactive people ask:
“Given this situation, what is the next useful step I can take?”

Reactive people ask:
“Whose fault is this?”

Once you switch to action over blame, you gain power.

2. Focus on What You Can Control

Your energy is limited.
Proactive people put their attention into:

actions

skills

habits

preparation

Reactive people waste time thinking about:

what others are doing

how others think of them

things they can’t change

This is where your confidence grows.

3. Anticipate Needs Before They Happen

Instead of waiting for a problem to occur, they think ahead:

“If I go to school tomorrow, what will I need?”

“If I ride long today, my sciatica might flare. So I stretch first.”

This is how maturity looks in daily life.

4. Do the Most Important Thing First

Not the easiest.
Not the most fun.
The most important.

This is where your growth happens.

5. Reduce Emotional Reactivity

You don’t let your feelings dictate your actions.
You show up even when you don’t “feel like it”.

Discipline is emotional regulation.

6. Keep Promises to Yourself

The fastest way to build self-respect is:
Say something. Do it. Repeat.

Even small things like:

“I’ll drink one glass of water before coffee.”

“I’ll sleep at 1:00 am.”

When your brain sees that you follow your own word, your confidence becomes unshakeable.

Every Day Has a Direction

You don’t need a detailed hour-by-hour plan.
Just a theme for the day:

Today is for learning.

Today is for moving my body.

Today is for connection or recovery.

Clarity prevents drifting.

8. You Respond Instead of React

You pause.
You choose the smartest move.
Not the emotional one.

This is how you become elevated.",1,1762700469.0,u_bloodymary1897,1,1.0,False

I could use some advice here. I currently have a generic Moka pot (picked up from a local shop), V60 pourover from Ikea and a French press ordered from Amazon. I’ve been using Blue Tokai’s pre-ground coffee, and I’ve also tried getting beans ground at their store — though they kind of messed up the grind size. Tried Starbucks once too.

I mostly brew with the French press every day. After reading a bunch of posts here, I’m wondering — should I keep buying beans and get it ground from Starbucks at once or finally get a Timemore C3S grinder?

Alternatively, would it make more sense to go for an Aeropress instead, since it’s more portable and easier to use?

Also, is upgrading to a Bialetti Moka pot actually worth it over a generic one?

Since I’ve never really tried coffee from an Aeropress, Moka pot, or French press outside, I don’t have a solid reference for what “good coffee” should taste like. Any input would really help.

I know a doctor, she's a woman practicing in a Gulf country. She started her education in Pakistan but finished her studies in a European country, like Sweden. She's in her late 20s. I met her through my friend, who's also a doctor. He was working a shift, and I brought him a coffee to his clinic. He said, ""Bring one for her too,"" and that's how I met her.

After that, I met her several times, and we had dinner together – just the two of us. I even met her mother. Until now, we were friends, and I thought she was a very good person. She's attractive, and everything about her is great. I was thinking of asking her out, like telling her I like her. But I had business in another city and had to leave for 10 days.

While I was away, I thought about her a lot. When I was free from work, I'd think about how she'd react if I told her how I feel. I was hesitant because she's a MBBS doctor, and academically, I'm not that successful. However, I own a business, I'm well-off, and I'm a self-made man. I'm 2 years older than her and have a very good income – I make 3-4 crore yearly, sometimes more. She'd already asked why I hadn't gotten married, saying I look good and stuff, and I'd complemented her too.

That's why I was thinking of asking her out. But when I came back, I hung out with a mutual friend,This guy is uneducated but can speak basic English. He's always dressed well, is overly flirty, and has a rented car – he doesn't own one and doesn't even have a job. I'd even lent him 20 lac. He's a friend from 8 years ago; he used to work for me. He's a bit of a fazool guy, zero worth, playboy type, with no future.

He told me he hooked up with someone, and he didn't know I knew her. He told me her name, and I was shocked. How could she choose him? I was thinking I might offend her by saying we should get married and that I like her, especially since I'm not well-educated. It disgusted me because he went on and on about her – how she calls him for hours, and he ignores her, doesn't give her attention. I was angry, and I left.

She knows he's not settled and doesn't earn anything, still she agreed to marry him. I'm conflicted by her choice. How can a person I respect and admire choose an uncultured swine? I want to warn her because it looks like she's serious, and he'll ruin her.

1osle5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1osle5x/my_30m_partner_29f_refuses_to_sleep/,My (30M) partner (29F) refuses to sleep,"How can I get my girlfriend to sleep more?

TLDR: Girlfriend sleeps so little its hurting our relationship and her health, but she either doesnt care or refused to accept that its a problem, but im starting to get stressed by it.

I don't know if I am blowing this way out of proportion but here goes.

Preface this by saying after over a year together, we have never had a single argument about anything until a few months ago we started having arguments about how little she sleeps, but when I say arguments its mostly me telling her its important to have good sleep and her trying her best to ignore that im being serious.

My girlfriend sleeps 5 hours a night at most, often a lot less. She wasnt working in the past and did have time to sleep or relax in the day to help make up for it, and also had the free time to do things like make meals, exercise, and study, whenever the tiredness wasnt too bad. A few months ago she started doing a full time job, and all of that has gone out of the window.

Currently we see each other 1 or 2 days a week average and she pretty much shows up at my house, lies on the sofa. I usually end up going in to the other room because if I leave, she will fall asleep fast. Even if I just go to the toilet or go get her a drink she falls asleep instantly, so I dont go back in the room to avoid waking her. Then after 30 minutes or an hour she wakes up, sees me in the other room, and gets mad at me for not spending time together.

At this point, we get something like an hour together before I see her start nodding off again and she cant hold conversation, so I will go get the bed out but then she starts fighting me on going to bed - she will want to drink alcohol or coffee and go outside for a walk to wake up.

Usually at mine I can get her to sleep for 6 or 7 hours if we include naps, but its very rare we have more than one night in a row together so she will be at home the next day and only sleep for 4 hours again.

This is probably my main problem. A lot of the time she is too tired after work to spend time with me, and the time we do spend together is majority either her lying there half asleep, or if I can get her to actually fall asleep I will just leave her there. There are also a lot of times where she is planning to come see me, but shes so tired that she nods off at home so im sat there waiting for 2 hours. Then many times, she wakes up and goes ""its too late now I may as well stay at home"".

There are also many times where we have something planned, but then all day she goes on and on and on about how tired she is. Many time she starts complaining about being tired, she will cancel our plans at the last minute, but if I suggest to her that we can cancel if shes too tired, she complains about me not wanting to spend time with her and starts angrily telling me shes not tired (yes I am aware of the contradiction here).

It cuts in to both potential time together we can have, and the actual time together we can have. When I try talk to her about this, she just makes jokes and ignores my seriousness, and she does this thing where she pulls her eyes open or smacks her face a little and goes ""look im awake"".

I have also tried approaching it from a health angle. I have waves of severe insomnia come around now and then, and I have had a lot of health complications from it in the past. I know first hand how bad it is for your health to not sleep properly. She manages fine now because she is only 29, but you cant pretend like its fine for ever and it keep working.

She had eczema and her skin is so much worse for not sleeping, and she also gets tons and tons of spots, which she is really self concious about. The few chances I have had to get her to sleep for 9 or 10 hours, for a day or 2 in a row, her skin clears up like some kind of miracle. However if I mention this to her, ""if you are self concious about your skin then why not sleep more since you know it makes it better"" then she turns it in to me somehow thinking shes ugly and I dont like her appearance.

Lack of sleep and the now total lack of exercise is also making her gain weight, which she is also really self concious about. I dont even talk about exercise at all unless she brings up how she is sad she isnt exercising, so I only bring up that if she was sleeping a healthy amount her metabolism would be working properly, and she would probably be managing her diet better.

I should clarify these two things above by saying that I really dont care at all for my sake; I only care for her sake. Though, I havent found out a way to tell her these things without it instantly becoming about me thinking shes ugly and fat, neither of which are true im totally in love with her! She is the most in shape person ive ever dated long term, and I couldnt care less about spots I dont even notice them until she complains about it!

Lastly she seems to get poorly much more now. Headaches, colds, upset stomach, and her menstrual cramps have gotten worse. The rare occasion I can make her sleep one or two good nights though, this also miraculously improves.

I have suggested she see a doctor for these things, and also to see one about sleep, but its always just jokes and shes fine theres no need to worry.

I am at a loss for how I can approach this with her. The relationship has been great for the most part but her just refusing to go to bed at a reasonable time is really putting a drain on it for me. I cant see a way to get her to take it seriously.

Sometimes it ends up sounding like im trying to parent her, so she gets annoyed. If I mention her health she gets mad because she thinks I hate the way she looks. Every time I suggest we lie down for a nap she fights me on it (I wont sleep but im happy to lie there with her). If shes at home and we are texting a lot that night, I will say something like ""dont you need to sleep, you have to wake up in 6 hours?"" and she will just avoid talking about it.",1,1762700208.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Every year I like to post what worked and works for me. Remember that your path is your own, you must find your way, do your thing, but we are all here with you to share this part of the road and share some of the light. I believe in you even if you don’t!

A big thank you to each and every one of you that make up this magnificient sub. It’s truly a blessing to be a part of this crew. A special thank you to my fellow mods, past and present, who make this sub possible, and the friends I have gotten along the way. I don’t know where I would be without you. Love you all!

My keys:

•	⁠Step out of the shadows. Posting, commenting and being part of the community changed everything for me.

•	⁠Set a goal. One hour, one day, one week; this trip, that visit - and count your victories! Then you know you can do it the next time too.

•	⁠Moderation doesn´t work. I tried it for ten years, and it only made me miserable.

•	⁠HALT. When I crave, am I really hungry, angry, lonely, tired? Staying one step ahead with some water, fruit or a snack has helped me a lot.

•	⁠Play the tape forward. What happens if I take this drink? The next hour, the next day, the next week? For me, drinking is not just about one day of hangover - it is 40 days with that voice in my head.

•	⁠Learn your triggers. Want a drink? Take a step or two backwards and see what just happened. Then, try to avoid it. It takes time to create new patterns, but it works. Knowledge is bliss.

•	⁠Allow yourself to mourn the losses. For me it´s like a long and painful breakup with the love of my life. That is in addition to lost opportunities, growth, finances, relations, you name it.

•	⁠Discover new joys. I´ve always loved fresh roast, hand brewed coffee; now I love it even more, particularly with the sunrise through my window.

•	⁠Afraid to fall? My motorcycle teacher taught me that if you stare at an object in the road, you will hit it. Look where you´re going, not where you´re not going.

•	⁠Did you fall? Don´t despair. Get up. The failure isn´t in falling, it´s in not getting up again.

•	⁠Struggling with motivation? We all do. Go for resolution in stead. Motivation shifts, resolution stays.

•	⁠Impatient? Waiting for that spunk, clarity, weightloss, zen born again bliss peace of mind? It took time to get where you are. It will take time and work to become the person you want to be, too. But you know what? You are already on your way, and that´s your doing. You can do this.

•	⁠Stressed out? Inhale grace, exhale gratitude.

I have not found any explicitly compatible Gaggia one on Amazon (I am from Czech Republic so I buy from German Amazon), but I have found this: [https://www.amazon.de/-/cs/gp/product/B0BYGLMPB9?smid=AYZPGTGY9RWQ4&psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/-/cs/gp/product/B0BYGLMPB9?smid=AYZPGTGY9RWQ4&psc=1)

It says that it should fit most of the portafilters, but I just want to make sure.

  
Questions are following:

* Have I chosen the right basket?
* Is there anything incompatible or missing from my list?

  
Recap of the information needed for ""Buying Advice Needed"" flair:

* I am from the Czech Republic.
* So far I drink Moca pot coffee regularly, but I want to transition to espresso or flat white.
* I have about two drinks a day, but mostly one.
* No space limitations.
* I am brand-new to this.
* After countless hours of reviews, reddit posts and whatnot my top candidate is Gaggia EG2109, but I have also looked at DeLonghi Dedica EC685 and DeLonghi Stilosa EC230.

Just to be clear, I am a complete espresso noob and I want to make my first budget setup to try and enter this intriguing hobby, but first I don't want to spend too much money. I like the style of Gaggia machines, but the Gaggia Classic is a little far from my preferred price range.

He responded that he's the plumber who has been working on my emergency drain issues.  The work is scheduled to happen tomorrow, assuming my landlord has sent over the authorization.  I responded that I'd want to wait until the job was completed but I'd be okay going for a coffee to get to know each other when things calm down. (He is attractive, but it's as much that I didn't feel safe rejecting the person scheduled to fix my bathroom when my toilet is currently sitting in the hallway.)

He responded while I was in the bathroom at my hotel (I have A.L.E. insurance) that he was more hoping for an fwb situation, but before I finished using the bathroom and brushing my teeth, he texted trying to brush it off with ""if you're not interested, we can forget this conversation happened"". I texted him back letting him know that I'm not angry, but while I don't have a bf I do already have the role of fwb filled (if I clicked with someone, the fwb and I would break it off. But I'm not gonna leave an fwb I trust and feel safe with for someone I know very little about.) He hasn't texted back yet.

I want to seek advice on what to do here. I don't want to screw up any aspect of someone's life for a lapse in judgement, but I'm also worried because of how many men are out there who would take ""revenge"" for a rejection when they're in a position to do so.  There's also the potential issue relating to compliance laws, since I don't know if he got my number off the client registry or if the texts were from a work phone, what laws apply to plumbers in this scenario, if he's made this offer to clients before, etc.

For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: Josh Allen
* RB: Rico Dowdle
* WR: Zay Flowers
* TE: TBD
* DST: TBD

💸 Tip Jar (Optional)

If this saves you time and fattens your bankroll → Tip the nerd🤓🧪

* CashApp: $FirePropsEV
* Buy Me A Coffee: FirePropsEV

Full filterable table with DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox can be found in my FREE Substack. Hope you enjoy, good luck!

Meu quarto fica na parte de cima da casa, e aí a telha é de ternite. No momento eu não penso em colocar forro porque eu tenho ctz q nao vai adiantar, mas posso pensar na possibilidade. Meu computador, ele esquenta muito, principalmente no verão. Então ele esquenta a ponto de ele começar a suar e queimar alguns componentes. Por exemplo, eu já perdi duas placas de vídeo, duas RX 550, já perdi duas. Já perdi uma placa-mãe. Eu tô com essa placa-mãe nova agora(3 anos), porém ela já tem alguns pontos de ferrugem devido a esse calor. Minha fonte, que é uma EVGA 430V, ela já tem 10 anos. E eu tenho Watercooler, com dois pentes de memória, que dá 16GB. A minha dúvida é, eu pensei em comprar um notebook gamer, vender essa CPU, esse computador que eu tenho, por ali aproximadamente 2mil, pegar o décimo e comprar um notebook gamer de 5 mil (acer nitro v15 por exemplo), porque aí quando fizesse calor eu colocava ele na parte de baixo da casa e ficava super tranquilo. Porém, 5 mil é muita grana, e eu não estava tão disposto a pagar isso por agora. Será que vale a pena eu dar um upgrade nesse computador, levar para uma assistência, fazer uma limpeza completa nele, dar um upgrade, sei lá, de uma placa de vídeo e uma fonte pelo menos? Porque 16GB de RAM consegue me ajudar por enquanto. Depois eu pretendo, poderia colocar 32GB, 2GB de 16GB e tal. Eu estou estudando programação, porem gosto muito de jogar, por isso não pego um notebook mais ""comum"".

Caso eu nao migre pro note gamer eu iria ter como gastar ai papo de 3mil.

E ai eu pensei em talvez comprar algum tipo de lona térmica que protegesse o computador do calor, colocar em cima dele.

I have treatment resistant session, BP2, cPTSD, & OCD. It doesn’t make shitty behavior ok but it is a chronic health issue that I’ve been working on for years. Insane amount of therapy, Rxs, lifestyle changes, only to realize that all I can do at the moment is to minimize symptoms and just try to stay alive through it all. Rule #1: don’t die (avoid if possible) 

Last night we were cleaning up dinner. I was washing dishes and he was cleaning up the other stuff. He kept cross-contaminating during the preparation and towards the end I asked him to clean that part up before proceeding. I have contamination OCD and felt a deep panic brewing. 
I told him I was really bothered. 
Ii
He explained that he cut the raw fish on one side of the cutting board and then flipped it over to cut up the fresh vegetables. The contaminated surface down and slide around the counter during the entire process. His can of seltzer touch the fish surface, he moved it to the coffee table, and then back to another place in the kitchen. 

When I asked him again he dismissed it as not a big deal and then I responded with “why is your defensive more valid that my request” and this set things off. He yelled for me to not talk to him like that, I yelled, then he yelled louder and started dinosaur screaming at him. I panicked, grabbed my purse, and fled. Barefoot and drove to a safe neighborhood spot. 

Returned after 15-20 minutes of cooling off and returned to the full force situation. Ultimatums, denial of apology, “you never change”, “this is all your fault” “you’re the entire problem”… started blaming my abusive family and shitty friends and declared that he’s the only one who give a shit…….and at that point he needed to leave my house but I really didn’t want that. This isn’t the first time. This is a cycle. 

Even though I tried to deescalate, it only got worse. He told me he’s done, made a loud scene in the driveway, left, came back, to get the fuxk away from his car window, and he drove off. 

One might think that’s it, done, but for over an hour afterwards it continued via text and calling. He continually blames and berates me no matter what I say. Almost, bI had to temporarily block him. I unblocked him this morning but  ",3,1762699573.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

Found out things about husband in early relationship,"Throwaway account because my husband uses Reddit. My (48F) husband and I have been together 25 years, married 17. Over the last year, we started talking about our past together, as well as our sexual history before meeting each other. Some surprising things came out.

For one, six months before we started dating in late 2000, while he was, he says, on a break with his girlfriend at the time, he had a weeklong affair with another girl who came to visit him. This girl then returned to her distant home and he resumed his other relationship. In his initial telling of the story, he immediately wrote to her and broke things off. Long story short, I later found out that he wrote to a mutual friend of the girl in 2005 complaining that he was disappointed the girl stopped writing to him. It's unclear how long their correspondence lasted, and he swears he doesn't remember any, but he concedes there must have been some, possibly extending into our relationship. I mean, if he was complaining 5 years later, it wasn't nothing, right?

Second, it turns out that in 2004, after we had been together 3+ years and cohabiting for 2, while visiting his parents he ran into this woman he never dated but had sex with multiple times in college. (EDIT: These happened before we knew each other.) They apparently were around each other a grand total of 5 times in 2 years and had sex 3 of those, including once at an outdoor concert and once right before she got married. Then they bumped into each other, six years after their last tryst, and she (still married) asked him to coffee to catch up. He accepted, but swears nothing happened. I never heard a word of this for 20 years.

He insists that neither of these things is significant, and I'm weird for thinking they are. I just want to know people's honest opinions on this. Am I overreacting? On a scale of 1-10, how seriously would you take these revelations and their concealment?",7,1762699535.0,Marriage,14,0.82,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of Big Ten titans as the Indiana Hoosiers (1-0) square off against the Marquette Golden Eagles (2-0) in a game that promises to be as statistically baffling as a toddler shooting free throws after their first coffee. Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s whiteboard and the humor of a locker room joke.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Indiana enters as a 2.5-point favorite, with implied win probabilities hovering around **61%** (thanks to those juicy -150 odds). Marquette? They’re clinging to a **40%** implied chance, which is about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of a game of rock-paper-scissors against a distracted parrot.

Last season, Indiana averaged a pedestrian **74.7 points per game** (147th nationally) but allowed an even less impressive **72 points per game** (182nd). Their three-point shooting? A tragicomedy: **6.3 makes per game at 32.1%** (think “casual” meets “disaster”). Meanwhile, Marquette’s defense held opponents to **68.7 points per game** (74th), but their own offense? A modest **76.6 points per game**, with a three-point barrage of **9.4 makes per game** (45th) — though at **32.6% accuracy**, it’s like they’re shooting from half-court with a garden hose.

Home-court advantage? Indiana’s home scoring jumps **7.4 points** (77.9) compared to their road dawdling (70.5). Marquette’s home numbers are slightly better (80.4 vs. 72.2), but their defense? A leaky sieve on a windy day.

1osl49k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1osl49k/in_some_ways_im_thankful_for_my_narcolepsy/,In some ways I'm thankful for my Narcolepsy.,"Hear me out before you bash me. I know it's hard and it's even harder when people say stupid shit, but hear me out. A lot of drama ahead, same drama that you face every day. I'm posting this because I knocked out a very important milestone in my life. 

I lost my previous account so I'm hitting up every now and then with this new one. 32 M accountant here. I went 29 years without a diagnosis, not even knowing what narcolepsy was. All the times I went to a doctor, I had to give blood tests and then got sent home with vitamin pills and injections. Took me one visit, years later after giving up, to a weird army veteran doc to realize what I was dealing with. He refused to officially diagnose me for legal reasons, but pointed me in the right direction and gave a lot of solid advice that still helps today.

I like to think that all those years spent fighting sleep, exhaustion, sleep paralysis, morning inertia and weak joints, it strengthened my will. Fighting every day, thinking I'm just like everybody, going to school, to work, and fighting it for years.

It forced me to take action. I accepted myself as a lazy guy who likes to sleep, and acted within those boundaries. I'm a lazy guy so I need a desk job. I'm a sleepy guy so I need a job with flexible hours. I'm too lazy to work so I will have macros and scripts do it for me. I make mistakes when I'm sleepy, so I will pull data into excel sheets and have formulas do it for me. It always paid off. 

Then came my first prescription, without an official diagnosis. I remember taking my first modafinil. I was in the army doing my mandatory service, all alone in a guard post, in pitch black with nobody in shouting range. Looking at the prescription and the side effects, I wasn't sure if I should take the pill, or flush it down the toilet. Things were so bad back then that I was considering the easy way out. I took off my gear. I took the pill, and the most important wait of my life began. For 23 minutes I looked at my sidearm on the desk, and then, slowly, zzzzZZT. I remember going to the toilet. I looked at my own eyes, and something started to fill up in me. I walked back to the room, and let out the loudest scream of my life. I collapsed on the desk and proceeded to cry my eyes out like a little bitch. The pill wasn't done however, it kept building up. I remember darting up, gearing up and walking out. I remember the face of my CO when he came to relieve me in the morning. 

After my service, I took a new job as an accountant. Same old rules, desk job, flexible hours, data sheets, macros, automation. I got diagnosed, and with a steady supply of medication, life turned ""normal"". But years of fighting stuck. It stuck and it paid off, big time. Here goes.

Last month, I got assigned a whole new spectrum of responsibilities, with even more manual labor, more excel sheets, more manual entries, more risks. Only improvement is that it relies much less on other people. So I did the only reasonable thing that a lazy, sleepy guy would. I automated it. I jacked up on modafinil, I'm normally taking half the prescribed dose, but I went back to the full dose. I worked two weekends, did overtimes every day, utilized 3 different AI's, paid out of pocket for costs, and finally automated 8 days of work. I squeezed it all into a 10 minute window. An AI backed macro that controls multiple programs at once, crosschecks multiple files, does the manual entries on multiple programs, prints them in perfect order, and sends mails to dozens of relevant people. All with a single click and not a glance required from me. 

At first I thought I wouldnt share this with my manager in fear of more responsibilities, but she's a good hearted woman so I decided to go along with it. Things played out much better than I'd hoped. This woman went ahead and instructed others to leave me to my work, that they shouldn't disturb me when I'm automating, and that she'd personally help them with anything if they go to her instead of me. On top of all that, I got a promotion and a raise. With almost half of my monthly work automated, she instructed me to read up and improve myself on ""whatever it is I do"". I'm now going to utilize this newfound time to automate more, control more, audit more. I finally have time to work on myself.

After two weeks of modafinil fueled, AI powered and coffee stained prompting, coding and debugging instead of manual accounting, I return home victorious. Today I took my pills not to work or do chores, but to fully enjoy my day. I'm playing music, smoking and playing video games. My mind is racing with new ideas, it opens up a lot of possibilities, but for now I just take notes and leave them for later. Today is my day. 

Why am I thankful for my narcolepsy? It taught me to work within my limits. It taught me discipline. It taught me automation. Make no mistake, my life is still a hellhole; I have chores to do, laundry to wash, dishes that has been sitting on the counter for God knows how long, errands that I've been delaying for months. I lost the opportunity of my life that would have made me a millionaire because of narcolepsy, I lost two girlfriends, I lost the respect of my family, and I'm pretty sure that I've lost many opportunities that I'm not even aware of. No matter. I can now afford a robot cleaner and a dishwasher with my raise.

I know it's a huge pep talk, and I know that I'm just one paralysis away from going back to suicidal mode. However I wanted to post this, so I can come back and go over this should I ever feel down, and maybe it might brighten up your day a little. And hey, who knows, maybe next year I'll automate things to the point where I don't have to work this corporate life anymore. Anyway, this is my hellhole, and today I choose to own it.

At 40 mg I felt it wear off near the end of the second month, so we bumped to 50 mg.

After figuring a few things out(zero coffee, L-Theanine, protine) 50 mg was amazing for focus. Side effects faded after a month, so we held it there.

Now that I’ve been slipping on self-care (protine, food, adding 1 glass of coffee, etc.), the side effects are back. I also started Cipralex (SSRI) recently.

Wondering:

Could the SSRI make my Vyvanse hit harder, like I need less now?

Would dropping back to 40 mg make sense, even if it felt weaker before (had no side effects)?


Anyone had something similar happen when combining SSRIs and Vyvanse or when improving/worsening self-care?

The Seattle Seahawks (6-2) are here to flex their 7-point favorite status against the Arizona Cardinals (3-5), and honestly? They’re about as threatening as a sleep-deprived dad on coffee. But hey, at least they’re favored by **-7.0** (decimal odds: 1.91 for Arizona to cover, 1.91 for Seattle), so the math says they’ll win. The implied probability?

**Key Stats to Know:**

* **Jaxon Smith-Njigba** (Seahawks): Leading the league with 948 receiving yards. He’s a touchdown machine, folks. Literally, FanDuel has him at **even money (+100)** to score an anytime TD. Bet on him, or bet against him, it’s like flipping a coin… if the coin had a 4.34-yard average depth of target.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball game so lopsided, it’s like watching a elephant play chess against a goldfish—*if the elephant also happened to be a former chess champion*. On Sunday, November 9, Harvard (1-0) hosts New Hampshire (1-1) at Lavietes Pavilion, and the odds make it clear: this isn’t a game. It’s a math problem. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread written by a stats nerd on coffee.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Harvard’s Implied Win Probability is Basically 100%

The betting lines treat Harvard as a near-lock. At FanDuel, Harvard’s moneyline odds sit at **+105** (wait, no—*actually*, their odds are so skewed, they’re listed as **1.05 in decimal**, which translates to a **95% implied probability**). For context, that’s the statistical equivalent of betting that the sun will rise tomorrow… in a universe where the sun *never* sets. New Hampshire, meanwhile, is a **+10.8 underdog**, implying an **8.7% chance to win**—about the same odds as correctly guessing someone’s birthday blindfolded, blind drunk, and while reciting the periodic table.

The spread? Harvard is favored by **15.5 points**, which, given last season’s numbers, isn’t even a “safe” line—it’s a “you-better-hide-the-15.5” line. Harvard scored **68.4 PPG** last year (315th in D1) but allowed a whopping **72 PPG** (182nd). New Hampshire, meanwhile, averaged **66.4 PPG** (16th-worst) while surrendering **76.6 PPG** (306th). In other words, this is a mismatch of defenses… and offenses… and basically everything.

### Team News: Harvard’s “Mighty” Offense vs. New Hampshire’s “Not-So-Mighty” Defense

Let’s start with Harvard. Their 79-50 win over MIT was so dominant, it’s being investigated by the Institute for Extraordinary Basketball Victories. Star player Thomas Batties II dropped 17 points, which is about **23% of MIT’s entire output** in that game. Harvard’s home-court advantage is also a factor: They averaged **69.2 PPG** at Lavietes Pavilion last season. Sure, their three-point shooting was worse than a toddler’s aim (**32.2%**, 278th nationally), but hey, at least they’re not *MIT*.

Now, New Hampshi

But from Monday when you wake up to Friday at 5PM you can only eat twice,  at any type of all you can eat place. You can drink black coffee, energy drink and electrolyte beverages as needed, and take vitamins in between but other than that all you get throughout the week is water. Also if your favorite NFL team has a Monday or Thursday night game you can have alcohol that night, but it must be your absolute favorite team that's playing. You get 10 special occasion days a year but it has to be something you didn't plan to have that day, like Christmas, thanks giving, a work event or wedding.... some one else's wedding obviously as you can't pick a day for an easy loophole. Other sports that have more frequent week day games are obviously out for the sports exception on drinks as there are too many of them. 

You must last 1 year, you will get paid monthly but will loose it all and have to back pay for food you ate if you fail. Medical emergencies will not count against you.

I’m fairly new here. 43 year old lunch lady that makes rockhounding and geode content on TT. A friend there made the comment “it’s like real life Stardew Valley!” 
Let the rabbit hole begin….

First I should give you a little backstory. 

Two years ago my family was booted from our home. A home my aunt had bought for us as a wedding gift with the promise that I would inherit it upon her passing. She passed in July 2023 and she did not deed anything. Her children liquidated the house and I lost all sense of security. I went no contact with my entire family and had a nervous breakdown that lasted about 9 months. 

But when you have nothing, you still have to keep going…

We did find a little house to rent. Me, the hubs, and our three children. I found my lunch lady job. Bit by bit, I rebuilt my life. I started making art with the idea of tiny little critics instead of adults (spoiler alert: children will love ALL of your art!) I discovered rockhounding, which led me to my love for nature and all of her gifts. I conquered my fear of the doctor, had a hysterectomy and feel better physically than I have in my entire adult life. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd. This gave me a sense of why I am the way I am and with that gave me so much grace with myself. Over the past two years, I’ve healed mentally and physically, but most importantly, found peace and contentment. 

And then I got that comment. This, I believe, might be the final piece to my puzzle. 

Some habits die hard. For me, it’s hygiene. Myself and my house both suffer when I’m spiraling. It’s been better in recent months, but not great. Since playing Stardew, I’ve been deep cleaning, rearranging, organizing, and purging. It’s INCREDIBLE. I have a daily schedule. I actually bought a planner and filled it out for the next year. I start my mornings with a shower and a cup of coffee. I’ve been meal prepping. I even made cookies with extra dough stored in perfect little balls in perfect little lines. Just so my family could have an easy sweet treat if they wanted it while I was at work. I go just a little bit slower and have much more patience these days. And I find a little bit of joy in doing it. 

I love this community. I’m so thankful for that person who made that comment. What a treat to find all of this. I’m not going to discredit my hard work to say Stardew has saved me, but it is definitely helping to reshape my brain chemistry at just the right time. So, in short, if you or someone you know is struggling (I know a lot of us are currently), suggesting Stardew might sound silly, but…💜💜💜",30,1762699262.0,StardewValley,4,0.97,False

I[M] am in Ahmedabad for a few weeks and figured I should meet some new people while I’m here. I live in the Netherlands and have been working in Amsterdam for the past 4 years in IT. It’s been a while since I’ve had proper Indian food that doesn’t taste like a fusion experiment gone wrong, so I’m on a mission to fix that while I’m here.

Would love to check out some good cafes or restaurants around the city, fancy or casual, as long as the food and vibe are good. If you’re in IT, even better. Always happy to talk about work, tech, or what life’s like in Europe. If you’ve ever thought about moving abroad or getting a job in the EU, I can share some tips too.

I can read and understand Gujarati, but don’t ask me to speak it, that part never quite developed. Also, I’m honestly tired of speaking English and Dutch all the time, so some desi conversations would be refreshing.

And for the record, I will die on the hill that Java is the best programming language.

If you’re up for hanging out, trying new food spots, or just chatting, drop a comment or DM.

## Why Edible Gifts are a Christmas Miracle

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

Before we get to the ideas, let's talk about why food gifts are a slam dunk.

*   **Universal Appeal:** Everyone eats! Whether you're shopping for your boss, your grandma, or your picky teenage cousin, there's a culinary gift out there they'll love.
*   **Zero Clutter:** In a world overflowing with ""stuff,"" a gift that gets eaten is a gift that doesn't need to be dusted, stored, or eventually re-gifted. It’s the gift of a great experience, minus the cleanup.
*   **Shows You Care:** Taking the time to bake a batch of cookies or curate a basket of their favorite snacks says, ""I really thought about you."" It feels personal and intimate.

## How to Choose the Perfect Food Gift

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

Picking the right gift is key. Ask yourself these three questions:

1.  **Who are they?** Consider their diet (vegan, gluten-free?), their taste preferences (sweet vs. savory?), and their cooking habits.
2.  **What's the occasion?** Are you looking for a hostess gift, a Secret Santa present, or a main gift for a close family member? The scale should match.
3.  **DIY or Buy?** Do you have the time and inclination to make something from scratch? A homemade gift is priceless. But don't underestimate the power of a beautifully curated store-bought item.

### ### For the Sweet Tooth

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

This is for the person who believes dessert is a food group.

*   **Gourmet Hot Cocoa Bombs:** These are all the rage for a reason. A sphere of rich chocolate that melts into a perfect cup of hot cocoa when you pour hot milk over it. You can buy beautiful, artisanal versions or make them yourself with silicone molds and high-quality chocolate.
*   **Artisanal Cookie Tin:** Forget the supermarket plastic tray. Bake a batch of your family's famous gingerbread or find a local bakery that sells stunning, hand-decorated shortbread cookies. Presentation is everything.
*   **Caramel & Sauce Collection:** A jar of homemade salted caramel, a rich chocolate fudge sauce, and a tangy raspberry coulis. It's a simple, luxurious gift that transforms ice cream, pancakes, or even coffee.
*   **Luxury Chocolate Box:** Go beyond the familiar drugstore brands. Seek out a local chocolatier or an online shop known for unique flavor combinations like dark chocolate with lavender sea salt or milk chocolate with candied ginger.

### ### For the Savory Snacker

For the one who prefers a cheese board to a cake plate.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

*   **Charcuterie Board Kit:** Assemble a ""board in a box."" Include a small block of high-quality cheese (like a aged cheddar or creamy brie), some hard salami or prosciutto, a jar of olives or cornichons, and a box of gourmet crackers.
*   **Artisanal Olive Oil & Vinegar Set:** A beautiful bottle of high-quality, extra virgin olive oil paired with an aged balsamic vinegar. It's a sophisticated gift that elevates salads, bread, and roasted vegetables. Look for ones with fun infusions like chili or basil.
*   **DIY Spice Rub & Marinade Collection:** If your recipient loves to grill or smoke meats, this is a winner. Create your own signature BBQ rub, a zesty chicken marinade, and a smoky pork rub. Package them in small, labeled jars.
*   **Gourmet Nuts & Snacks Mix:** Create a custom ""holiday trail mix."" Think wasabi-covered peas, candied pecans, roasted almonds with rosemary, and some high-quality dark chocolate chips.

### ### For the Home Chef & Foodie

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

This person doesn't just eat food; they live for it.

*   **Specialty Cooking Oil & Vinegar Set:** Go beyond the basics. Truffle oil, chili-infused oil, and sherry vinegar can totally revolutionize their cooking.
*   **Gourmet Salt Sampler:** Yes, salt is a fantastic gift! A set with smoked salt, Himalayan pink salt, and flaky sea salt will show them you understand the details that make a dish sing.
*   **DIY Sourdough Starter Kit:** For the friend who has gotten into baking. Give them a live, bubbly sourdough starter in a jar, a beautiful banneton (proofing basket), and a recipe card to get them started on their bread-making journey.
*   **Unique Pasta Shapes & Sauce:** Find a shop that sells artisanal, bronze-cut pasta in fun shapes like radiatori or trofie. Pair it with a jar of fancy vodka sauce or a truffle-infused Pesto.

### ### For the Health-Conscious

Delicious and thoughtful doesn't have to mean indulgent.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20gifts%20for%20christmas)

*   **High-Quality Tea Collection:** Curate a set of loose-leaf teas. Think festive flavors like spiced chai, peppermint, and a caffeine-free rooibos blend.
*   **DIY Granola Kit:** Layer the dry ingredients in a mason jar: rolled oats, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Attach a tag with instructions on what wet ingredients to add and how to bake it.
*   **Healthy Snack Box:** A basket filled with premium, good-for-you treats. Think raw nuts, high-quality dried mango, dark chocolate bark, and maybe some roasted chickpeas.
*   **Manuka Honey & Nut Butter Duo:** A jar of high-grade Manuka honey (known for its health benefits) paired with a jar of artisanal almond or cashew butter is a simple, elegant, and healthy gift.

## Pro-Tips for Gifting Food Like a Pro

*   **Presentation is Key:** A simple mason jar, a nice tin, or a beautiful basket goes a long way. Use a bit of festive ribbon, a sprig of rosemary, or a custom tag to make it special.
*   **Include an Ingredient List:** This is especially important for homemade gifts! It's a courteous and necessary step for anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions.
*   **Add a Personal Note:** Tell them why you chose this gift for them. ""I made this salted caramel because I know how much you love it in your coffee."" It makes all the difference.
*   **Think About Timing:** For perishable items, either deliver them close to Christmas day or make sure the recipient knows they need to be refrigerated or frozen.

The tricky part is that after a recent car accident, I’m currently stuck at home, in bed 90% of the time. In another week and a half, I’ll hopefully get the all-clear to start weight-bearing on my leg again and do PT and OT, but even then, I won’t be cleared to drive until likely mid-late December, so I’ll have to use Ubers/Lyfts to get anywhere. 

I’m coming to you all for some brainstorming ideas for how to date myself in this scenario.  I feel like this list is meh, and maybe it’s the heavy pain meds, but I’m struggling to make it less meh. Since I’m using all my PTO on this accident/injury, I also won’t be able to take any vacations or time off until next Sept when my PTO renews, so it has to be things I can do locally in a small-mid size city on weekends or evenings. 

My ideas so far: 
- Learn to sew (I have a sewing machine already) 
- Journal regularly to better track how I’m feeling about things 
- Start reading again
- Do puzzles again 
- Go out to coffee shops and restaurants (and actually eat there, not takeout)
- Exercise (once given the go ahead) 
- Clean home regularly, stop procrastinating basic tasks 
- Volunteer locally on weekends 
- Make friends with another woman locally (idk how to go about this, but I’m tired of not having friends that live in my city, but I’ve usually had a romantic partner so it hasn’t bothered me as much until now) 

I welcome your insight!

Please be honest. Your votes may dictate my decision. 

I am very busy, so I don't foresee this starting until January. December possibly, but my vote's on January. 

This sub is a few years old and I'd like to take it off of reddit and switch to MailerLite. They're cheaper & have lower fees than Substack & Patreon.

I know some of you think I am completely insane for even thinking this, BUT everyone thought I was a crazy loser and told me I wouldn't get any followers on this sub. I consider a Substack or Patreon no different... I want to use MailerLite but I'll just say Substack in this post.

Post launch, this sub will remain up and I'll post a few teaser sentences for my entries before linking the remainder of my posts to the Substack. 

I'm thinking about charging $3.99/mo. or $2.99/mo.

What will a subscription get you? My 2 cents on every GGE episode that's released post Substack launch & maybe some older episodes that I think were insane. It will also get you exclusive content from Ashley & Rayna's standup performances - I will attend more often. I'll be hosting a live watch party for Ashley's special for my subscribers only, and I'd like to weigh in on trends as well, like the viral British Vogue article ""Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?""

So please vote in my poll. I will keep it open for as long as possible so I can get the most votes to gauge interest. I will probably pin this post to the top of this sub as well.

I can not thank all of you enough for following. I really have fun with this sub sometimes. ""Ashley's Wedding Is A Recession Indicator,"" that title takes me out. Outside of this sub, I have created comedic content for a very long time and I am friends with some of the most talented standup comedians. They're geniuses, I'm not. But I can bring originality to the table, like more fan fiction posts. Although the snark sub is lively, they don't bring my psycho vibes. My nonsense is exclusive. 

So! I hope you'll give me the green light because there is a possibility I'll shut this sub down if I don't monetize it because I believe $3 or $4/mo is worth it. It's less than a coffee or soda in a restaurant. 

I just don't know if I want to keep posting when my plate is already very very full. Again, I believe that if this sub has subscribers (when I was told no one will follow me), I don't believe that a Substack will be any different... And I am more than happy to only post for the 4 or 400+ people who subscribe. Doesn't matter to me. I would be happier and I would attend more of their shows and weigh in on more trending topics & recap sh!t like Love Is Blind. I'm a Love Is Blind stan and I interviewed someone from the cast a few years ago.

Basically, I think there are plenty of reasons to subscribe other than GGE. Please vote honestly so I can gauge interest/disinterest. Thanks so so much. 🥹

1oskqsl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oskqsl,Moon Palace Grand review not from TA or biased,"Recent stay at the Moon Palace Grand based on fellow coworkers recent stay. We were torn between Beaches in Jamaica, or even Turks and Caicos (I know we just wanted to get away and they all were in a relative price range). Stayed in family suite in building 89. 7/10 overall. 

Sales pitches: we could’ve just checked in, and left for room, but were moved back and forth (for no reason) and accidentally hit the teal short upsellers. We are very good at saying no and got out in about 2 minutes of their spiel. Checkout had it again. They tried calling each day and I politely hung up on them. The credits aren’t real. Read the reviews on those. I started with 1500 credits and left with 1500.

Luggage/Bell boy: very nice. But I wish we took our luggage and just walked to our building. We were pretty far away from the check in but was still only 5 minute walk. Waited 60 minutes for luggage. Another tip we had to pay.

Room: not bad, very nice stone. Our adjoining room had horrible smell like paint. But bad paint. They tried to fix it multiple times. Still never went away. The smell was the same as the paint they were using to fix one of the slides. I wondered if the workers used the rooms as there was green paint outside the building , same color they used. 

Activities: we had kids with us and they loved the slides and water park. Beach is hot trash. No one was near there. Loved the arcade and playroom. The arcade is way too crowded and parents were playing. There were some kids not taking turns and that added to the issue as it’s free play, unlimited. Magic show was good but trying to sell magic boxes at the end, don’t let kids go on stage! The kids liked the bounce thing that was just in a Big ballroom.

Food: Buffet: it was Mexican food trying to be American 6.5/10 lunch, 7/10 breakfast.
Italian In the lodge: 7/10, fastest food 
JC steakhouse:3/10. Food was so so and it took 1.5 hours to get food. It was so crowded in there and good food had an upcharge.
Circus: 4.5/10 on food, 9/10 atmosphere. 
La cantina: 6/10 food, 8/10 atmosphere 
Room service: not bad, small portions
Habibi: 7/10 food, hard to get reservations.
In fact all portions are small, order multiples of hungry!

Kids loved the ice cream and coffee/pastries from the 24 hr thing at the main lobby.

Alcohol: not bad, lots of bars. Some ran out of bottles and some had better selections. Be specific on drinks if picky. Cleanliness back there may be desired….i question if drinks are watered down.

Ideally, the foundation is learning to love and accept yourself first because whether someone comes along or not, your life is still full. But sometimes, the heart still urges us to search. So here I am, honestly presenting what I hope for in a partner and in a relationship. I know perfection doesn’t exist, neither in me nor in anyone else, and that’s okay.

* Personality: Thoughtful, reflective, honest, and emotionally aware. I value kindness, patience, and meaningful conversation
* Style: Minimalist and natural. Makeup is occasional (cause Idk how to); fashion is casual and comfortable but presentable when needed
* Food: Kaldereta, sinigang, and kare-kare are my top 3 fave ulam
* Coffee: iced > hot

* Someone who enjoys good conversations about life, hobbies, or meaningful things
* A person who values quality time, whether exploring new places, trying activities, or relaxing with a good movie or playlist
* Physical attraction is important, so swapping pics early is fine
* A healthy, active lifestyle is a plus. I’m working on my own fitness goals and would love a partner who shares or supports that

1oskpw7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oskpw7,Moon Palace Grand review not from TA or biased,"Recent stay at the Moon Palace Grand based on fellow coworkers recent stay. We were torn between Beaches in Jamaica, or even Turks and Caicos (I know we just wanted to get away and they all were in a relative price range). Stayed in family suite in building 89. 7/10 overall. 

Sales pitches: we could’ve just checked in, and left for room, but were moved back and forth (for no reason) and accidentally hit the teal short upsellers. We are very good at saying no and got out in about 2 minutes of their spiel. Checkout had it again. They tried calling each day and I politely hung up on them. The credits aren’t real. Read the reviews on those. I started with 1500 credits and left with 1500.

Luggage/Bell boy: very nice. But I wish we took our luggage and just walked to our building. We were pretty far away from the check in but was still only 5 minute walk. Waited 60 minutes for luggage. Another tip we had to pay.

Room: not bad, very nice stone. Our adjoining room had horrible smell like paint. But bad paint. They tried to fix it multiple times. Still never went away. The smell was the same as the paint they were using to fix one of the slides. I wondered if the workers used the rooms as there was green paint outside the building , same color they used. 

Activities: we had kids with us and they loved the slides and water park. Beach is hot trash. No one was near there. Loved the arcade and playroom. The arcade is way too crowded and parents were playing. There were some kids not taking turns and that added to the issue as it’s free play, unlimited. Magic show was good but trying to sell magic boxes at the end, don’t let kids go on stage! The kids liked the bounce thing that was just in a Big ballroom.

Food: Buffet: it was Mexican food trying to be American 6.5/10 lunch, 7/10 breakfast.
Italian In the lodge: 7/10, fastest food 
JC steakhouse:3/10. Food was so so and it took 1.5 hours to get food. It was so crowded in there and good food had an upcharge.
Circus: 4.5/10 on food, 9/10 atmosphere. 
La cantina: 6/10 food, 8/10 atmosphere 
Room service: not bad, small portions
Habibi: 7/10 food, hard to get reservations.
In fact all portions are small, order multiples of hungry!

Kids loved the ice cream and coffee/pastries from the 24 hr thing at the main lobby.

Alcohol: not bad, lots of bars. Some ran out of bottles and some had better selections. Be specific on drinks if picky. Cleanliness back there may be desired….i question if drinks are watered down. I had equivalent of 9 tequila shots in 2 hrs and I was not much more than a little tipsy. I had a bottle of wine the night before and two glasses had me very drunk. Use that as a comparison if you will.

Overall, not bad. Was it better than beaches? Food came faster than at beaches and staff was more attentive. Would I go again? Probably not. But no regrets at all.",0,1762698452.0,CancunAllInclusives,0,0.5,False

1oskok1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oskok1/the_story_behind_the_lost_1976_pellington_mothman/,The story behind the lost 1976 Pellington Mothman film [Part 1],"Author's note: I've been listening to Creepcast for a little over a year now and got inspired this spooky season to write a little story of my own. I originally planned to put this on nosleep, but since the mods have made it a crime punishable by banishment to make a found media story or to give your characters full names (?), I'm posting it here instead. Hope y'all enjoy. More parts coming very soon, I originally seperated the story into 3 parts, but didn't account for Reddit's word limit, so I had to chop it up into smaller bits.

If you've spent any time looking into Mothman, or cryptids in general, you're probably familiar with the so-called “Pellington Mothman film”. One of the most famous pieces of cryptid lost media, it was supposedly shot by paranormal researcher John Pellington in 1976, during the second wave of Mothman sightings in Point Pleasant. Sheriff Linda Johnson, one of the people claiming to have seen the film for herself. gave the following description on the Unsolved Mysteries episode 'Mothman': “What I saw on that film will be burned into my mind for the rest of my life. The film was black and white. It first showed a man, someone I happened to have known personally lying in the middle of the forest. I don't know if he was dead, or just unconscious. He had a brown jacket that was all torn up, like it had huge claw marks on it and his head was covered by a large hat. Then out of the dark steps this, this thing. There were several people close to the camera, and they all shined their lights on it. It was shaped like a person, but it clearly wasn't, it looked more like a huge bug of some kind. Its eyes were glowing, and it had these two large arms with claws, and then two smaller ones at its chest. On its head were long antennae and the mouth was just a whole bunch of parts that were all moving and smacking against each other. It stood there for a moment, then it leaned down to the body and grabbed it with all four of its arms. This is when one of the people, a woman raised up a rifle and it looked like she tried to fire at it. But it just folded out these huge wings, like moth wings and took off, taking the body with it.” Watching this episode, and the horrifying reenactment of this specific scene traumatized me as a kid. I still remember lying awake at night, looking out the window to the nearby forest for any signs of Mothman. As I grew older, this story continued to stick in the back of my mind as a dim childhood memory, until one day it bubbled up to the surface, leading to me asking myself “What the hell was that about?”. Tracing down the episode of Unsolved Mysteries wasn't difficult (season 12 episode 6, it's on YouTube), but it didn't give much info on the film besides the one account and the reenactment. So, I decided to do some more digging. I found that, even though multiple people have attested to having watched this film, or even having been present while it was taken, the film itself has never surfaced. There also weren't a lot of details about the circumstances in which it was taken, all I could find is that it happened during the filming of a Mothman centered documentary. Most disturbing yet intriguing, I found that Pellington himself was admitted to a mental hospital not long after announcing the filming of his documentary. Believers cite this as proof that he was in fact haunted by the Mothman, which caused him to go insane, while skeptics cite this as the origin of the 'Pellington film urban legend'. But at this point my research hit a dead end. Mere online searching wouldn't help me any further. But since I didn't live that far away from Point Pleasant, West Virginia myself, one summer I made the decision to head over there myself and see if I could find something there, maybe by checking the town's archives or looking for other witnesses who might have been involved. What I expected to be only a brief trip, turned into a months-long research project that led to me unearthing a number of documents that shed a lot of much needed light on this case. Most importantly, I was able to trace down the personal writings of investigative journalist Emily Sherwood, which provide a detailed firsthand account of the events leading up to the shooting of the film, as well as the aftermath. As I quickly found, the story doesn't end with the film being taken, in fact it only keeps getting stranger and stranger. The following posts will present a timeline of the bizarre events that took place in that October of 1976, consisting primarily of the writings from Emily Sherwood's notebook, transcripts she made of her own audio recording, as well as some other various bits of newspaper accounts, etc. I also included a few brief notes of my own for context. But still, the Pellington film itself continues to elude me. This is why I have decided to post what I was able to find so far, in hopes that someone might be able to provide further details. To anyone wanting to read through all of this, I will warn you that the further you go down this case, the more puzzling and disturbing it gets, which is also what makes it so fascinating.

The first document in this chronology is a newspaper article, published in the Point Pleasant Register on September 24^(th) ,1976 and written by local journalist Woodrow Barker, who will continue to be an important figure during the entire case.

***Paranormal Expert to Visit Point Pleasant as Mothman Sightings Continue***

 *It has been more than 10 years since two couples driving through the remote TNT area described their hair-rising encounter with a ""man-sized bird... creature... something"" that plunged our small town into a wave of terror for the next year. The elusive 'Mothman' which spooked so many of our residents is set to have been more than seven feet tall, shaped like a man with enormous black wings and piercing red eyes, described by one eyewitness as “red like you never saw red”. The creature was first reported on November 15****^(th)****, 1966, and continued to terrorize Point Pleasant for over a year, with the most dramatic encounters describing it chasing after or landing on the witnesses' car, or peering through the windows of one terrified family as it tried to enter their home. Then, on December 15****^(th)****, 1967 tragedy struck, as the Silver Bridge that connected Point Pleasant to Gallipolis, Ohio collapsed, killing 46 people in the process. It was on that day, that sightings of the Mothman virtually stopped, leaving many to wonder if the presence of this strange being could have been an omen of some sort, perhaps a warning or even a curse that had befallen this town. In the following years, things started to quiet down again. Most outsiders who had heard of this string of sightings simply dismissed them as mass hysteria, a few rural townspeople that got scared by owls at night. But those who actually saw it, are still haunted by the terror they witnessed and insist that what they saw could not have been any ordinary bird. And whatever this terror is, it may have just made its second appearance. On August 13****^(th)****, 1976, at around 10 pm, local resident Ace Dewitt was out hunting with his dog near the TNT area when he encountered what he first thought to be an owl sitting up in a tree. As he got nearer to it, he realized it was much too large, even larger than a person, still staring at him with enormous red eyes. At this point he became scared and fired his rifle towards it, to which it let out a deep howl and soared up into the night. He reported this sighting to county sheriff Linda Johnson and after it hit the press, many others came forward with their own accounts, confirming that the Mothman, whatever it is, had indeed returned. Due to its frequent appearances near the abandoned munitions plant commonly known as the 'TNT area', many speculate now as they did 10 years ago that the Mothman was in reality created by our own government and is now haunting the ruins of the facility where it was once held captive. One of the most vehement proponents of this theory is paranormal investigator John Pellington, who cites accounts of eyewitnesses being intimidated by so called 'Men in Black' as evidence of a government cover up of the Mothman's real nature. Only a few days ago, he announced his upcoming trip to Point Pleasant with the purpose of filming a documentary about the recent sightings, hoping to “reveal the reality of Mothman and expose the wrongdoing perpetrated by our own government”. He plans to set out into the TNT area with his camera crew to capture footage of our elusive local beast. Also said to appear in his documentary is notable Mothman skeptic Emily Sherwood, a long-term writer for the magazine Skeptical Inquirer, her purpose is to provide a more “rational perspective” during the course of Pellington's documentary. She also plans to conduct her own separate investigation into the sightings, which will appear as an article in Skeptical Inquirer, with the likely goal to debunk the existence of Mothman. However, many remain curious as to what Pellington and his crew might be able to document in that remote area, whose curse never seems to fully lose its grip on our town.*

Starting now are the personal notes made by Sherwood, which were meant as drafts for her Skeptical Enquirer article, that she never ended up writing.

*October 9****^(th)****, 1976*

*When I first heard that sightings of the old Mothman were making a comeback, I immediately suspected that Pellington couldn't help himself but to resurrect his theories for the occasion. I thought he might write a new book or two, considering how well his first 'non-fiction' novel on the topic had performed and that I might write a quick article fact-checking his work. But all in all, I planned to stay out of the Mothman business this time, thinking I had done a well enough job debunking the sightings a number of years ago and that this new wave was nothing but a repeat of the same localized mass hysteria, leaving little for me to add to my original comments. But of course, life never does quite work out the way you plan it, so you can imagine my surprise when I received an invitation from John Pellington himself. Instead of just writing a book, he would take it a step further and film an entire documentary on these new sightings and wanted me to appear in it. 'Wanted' might be a strong word however, it was rather that the TV network demanded to have a 'skeptical voice' on the program to contrast his own position. This point also depleted my hope that, after all this time, Pellington might have finally taken on a more rational position on this subject. But no, just as his book did before, this new documentary will set out to prove not only the fact that Mothman exists, but that he is an escaped top secret experiment whose existence has been covered up by some vague, yet menacing government agency. Why the government would be working to create a giant bird or moth person, or why such an experiment would go into hiding for ten years reemerging only now to once again spook the local townspeople, I suppose only a keen investigative mind such as Pellington's could have figured out. But in the end, I am always glad to be able to contribute my views on this subject, even if it is for a sensationalized program like this, so I agreed. I planned a trip over to Point Pleasant, West Virginia, quickly booking myself a hotel room and just like that, almost 6 years after I thought I wrote my last article on this subject, I was back in the Mothman business once again.*

*Even after all this time I spend writing about this town and its elusive cryptid, I have actually never been to Point Pleasant myself until now. For me, this presents an unprecedented opportunity to conduct my most thorough investigation yet. So far, I had to rely on the eyewitness testimony provided by Pellington and others, but now I could interview the firsthand witnesses myself, inspect the places in which the Mothman was supposedly seen and maybe be able to lay this entire debate to rest once and for all. During the last stretch of my drive, I happened to pass through the thick, forested landscape of the now famous TNT area. Even though I didn't believe it, I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy having read all the accounts myself. It was already getting dark, and despite it being the middle of October, there was enough foliage left in the trees to obscure any presence that might be lurking within. It was an easy area for the mind to play tricks on itself and I was glad to be able to leave it behind for now. Finally, I reached the small town of Point Pleasant. It really was your typical small town, none of the buildings were too big, they were square shaped and made from red cinder blocks. At this late hour, it almost seemed like a ghost town, only occasionally did another car or a pedestrian pass my view. The hotel I booked my room in also wasn't the newest one and could have used a proper renovation, but for my time being here, it would have to do. When I entered and asked for my room, the man behind the counter simply looked up my name and then gave me the key without saying a word. I noticed that nearly all the keys were still present behind him. I had expected more tourists to be here trying to see the Mothman for themselves, but perhaps the novelty of the first sightings had already worn off. Less interruptions to my investigation, I thought and slowly walked up the creaking stairs into my room. It had a bed, a closet, a table with two chairs, and a single lamp that flickered slightly and created an irritating buzzing noise whenever it was turned on. I wouldn't need it much anyway, as there was a large window next to the bed, from where the light of a nearby streetlight always illuminated the room. For now, I would try to get some sleep, because tomorrow I was going to meet with Pellington himself and my investigation would begin.*

*October 10****^(th)****, 1976*

*Today was the day I would meet Pellington in person for the first time. The idea of being face to face with the man whose writing I have vehemently criticized for so long did make me a little nervous. I was sure that, in his head, he had already prepared rebuttals against every point I was going to make. At least I know that I had against his usual arguments. We agreed to meet at the Point Pleasant Riverfront Park and by the time I got there, he and his camera crew had already set up shop and were in the process of interviewing their first eyewitness. I recognized his face from the papers, it was the hunter Ace Dewitt, whose sighting was the catalyst for the recent Mothman reports. He was an older man, stern faced, with an unkempt beard. I already had my ideas as to what he actually saw, but was going to interview him for myself before reaching an official conclusion. I waited for Pellington to finish his interview, then started to approach him. “Hello, Mr. Pellington? You wanted me for your documentary?” He turned around and immediately stretched out his arm. “Well, if it isn't Emily Sherwood, it's an honor to finally meet you in person!” I shook his hand, somewhat surprised by his friendly demeanor. At first glance he seemed like a very average person, not the kind you'd expect to write wild theories about paranormal phenomena. He wore a clean brown suit, and his hair and beard were very well groomed. Still, his neat appearance and friendly introduction weren't enough to cover an underlying hint of mistrust glaring in his eyes. “It's an honor to see you too.” I responded. He continued: “I don't suppose anything happened in the last few years that would have made you change your view on the things happening around here?” “If you mean Mothman, no. There still isn't any evidence that anything unknown to science is behind these sightings, both the older, and the recent ones.” I said, to which he rebuked: “Not as long as people like you stay closed off to new possibilities.” I was about to respond with my own counter point, but he cut me off: “Let's not get at each other's throats already, save that for your article, alright? Let me introduce you around first.” He was right, I thought. If we wanted any kind of cooperation in this investigation, we shouldn't immediately go off into pointless arguments. “Besides, a lot can happen in the next few weeks.” He turned around and led me up to a man who was currently tinkering with a large camera. “This is George Scarberry, my trusted cameraman. George, meet Emily Sherwood, she is the skeptic I told you about.” Scarberry, a balding man with a walrus mustache, looked up briefly and gave me a nod with an unintelligible grunt. Pellington pointed me to the next man, a young fellow with dark hair, who was scribbling something down in a small notebook. “And this is Woodrow Barker, a local journalist who is going to write his own story for the Point Pleasant Register.” “Nice to meet you.” I introduced myself. He looked up and greeted me with a friendly grin. “Ah yes, Miss Sherwood, the debunker. I cannot believe you came all the way out here just to call us all crazy.” His hostile response caught me off guard: “Of course not, I just don't think-” “Nah, I'm just kidding.” he interrupted “I don't really believe this whole thing myself, you know?” “But I read your article” I responded “and it seemed you were quite convinced, with all this talk of people knowing what they saw.” “Ah, you know, the newspapers always want us to play up these sorts of things. Whatever makes them sell more copies. But me personally? I'll believe in Mothman the moment he crashes head first into my electric bug zapper.” I chuckled at his last comment, but I wasn't sure if I should commend his skepticism or condemn his willingness to abandon it this easily. “Oh, he's real alright. Just wait until you'll see him yourself.” A hoarse voice interrupted our conversation. I turned around and reached my hand out to the rough looking man who now stood right behind us: “Ace Dewitt, I presume. Nice to meet you.” He grabbed my hand reluctantly as his eyes narrowed. “You city folk think you have it all figured out. But we all know he's real.” “I don't!” Barker couldn't help but interject. “That's just because you ain't seen him yet, like I have. Sends the soul right out of your body, that sight.” he mumbled. “About that” I began to ask “I would like to interview you about your sighting. If that would be alright with you.” He thought for a moment “It would.” then he turned his head back to me “But you don't change one word of what I said in your article.” “Of course I won't, you'll be able to read it yourself.” I reassured him. Now Pellington got his word back into the conversation: “Mr. Dewitt here kindly agreed to show us the location in which he sighted the creature tomorrow. I assume you would be interested in coming along as well?” he asked me. I most definitely was.*

Sherwood recorded all of her interviews as well as some field investigations with a handheld tape recorder. While the actual recordings have been lost as far as I know, the transcripts she made of them have survived. This one documents her first interview with Ace Dewitt.

*Sherwood: Alright, let's start off with some basic details. What's your full name?*

*Dewitt: Ace Dewitt.*

*Sherwood: Your age?*

*Dewitt: 52*

*Sherwood: How long have you lived in Point Pleasant?*

*Dewitt: I've lived here my whole life. Point Pleasant has always been my home.*

*Sherwood: And how long have you been hunting here?*

*Dewitt: Ever since I was a young boy, my dad used to take me out in the woods, taught me how to shoot his rifle. Same rifle I use today.*

*Sherwood: What kind of animals do you usually hunt?*

*Dewitt: Anything that gets in my sight, but mostly owls. There's a lot of 'em here, they nest in the old factory out there.*

*Sherwood: Did you ever see anything during the first Mothman sightings?*

*Dewitt: Yes, I thought I saw some strange bird like thing once. Could have been an owl, but from what I saw, it seemed a bit too large.*

*Sherwood: And when was this?*

*Dewitt: This was in 1966, in uh, let me think, no January '67, it was very early that year.*

*Sherwood: So shortly after the first sightings were publicized.*

*Dewitt: Yes, I read about this bird thing in the newspaper and kept my eye out. Thought I could be the one to shoot it. It'd be one hell of a trophy.*

*Sherwood: Let's get to your recent sighting. When was this again?*

*Dewitt: Just two months ago, August 13****^(th)****.*

*Sherwood: And at what time of day?*

*Dewitt: It was already dark so, probably around 11pm.*

*Sherwood: Alright, just start telling me what happened.*

*Dewitt: So, I was out hunting in the TNT area, this was near one of the bunkers, with my dog Roger, he's a very reliable dog. And..*

*Sherwood: Sorry to interrupt, but do you remember the exact spot where this took place?*

*Dewitt: Yeah, I always recognize this bunker with its broken door, every time you feel like someone is watching you from in there. I wanted to show the TV guy and the others, remember?*

*Sherwood: Of course, I'm sorry, please continue. What happened next?*

*Dewitt: I walked past the bunker and I thought I heard something fly just overhead. I looked around to see where it went, that's when I saw these two huge red eyes, just staring down at me. I've seen all sorts of eyeshine over the years, but I never saw anything this bright or red. I'm still thinking, this is probably an owl. I wasn't really looking for owls that night, but I wanted to give it a shot, so I got my rifle. That's when I noticed, Roger was all quiet. I thought it was weird, because usually he gets pretty upset when he sees an owl, that's why I leave him behind when I go look for them. But he was just staring at this thing, completely frozen. And that's when I really saw it. I don't know why, maybe the moon came up from behind the clouds, but something made it more visible than before. It was no owl, it was far bigger, maybe bigger than a person. And it just sat there and kept staring like it was gonna jump at me any moment. At that moment, I felt real fear, like I knew there was some predator, far stronger than me, so I shot at it before it could get me. Then it let out this deep howl, still makes me shudder to this day and it jumped in the air, and I saw its huge wings for just a second before it was gone. You can't imagine how much my heart was racing at that moment.*

*Sherwood: Then what did you do?*

*Dewitt: I just grabbed Roger and went home as quick as possible. I didn't wanna spend another moment in the woods while that thing was still out there. Even at home I thought it might come back.*

*Sherwood: And when did you report your sighting?*

*Dewitt: The next day. I still remember 10 years ago, those teenagers told the sheriff about it, so that's what I did. Thought if that thing was back, someone should better warn the people.*

*Sherwood: And you're certain that what you saw really was Mothman? It couldn't have been an unusually large owl?*

*Dewitt: Listen, I would have known if it was an owl. I know all kinds of owls in this area and that was nothing like them. Even Roger knew that's not what it was.*

*Sherwood: Alright then, thank you for your time.*

*(end of recording)*

*To me, Dewitt seemed like a genuine witness to something he could not identify. That does not mean that what he saw something completely unexplainable. It's very possible that he did get scared by an owl, an unusually large one, perhaps a species that doesn't usually appear around this area. Still, I was intrigued to join Pellington’s little expedition, even if my hopes of finding any trace of the actual animal observed by Dewitt were exceedingly low, given the time that had already passed since his sighting.*

This next transcribed recording was made on October 11^(th), during the first expedition to the bunker where Dewitt made his sighting.

*Sherwood: 10:05 pm, we have reached the TNT area, and are about to enter into the forest, we're only waiting for..*

*Pellington: There he is!*

*(sound of car approaching)*

*Barker: I didn't miss Mothman, did I?*

*Pellington: No, we're about to go in, George, is the camera ready?*

*Scarberry: Ready, boss.*

*Pellington: Then we're ready to go. Mr. Dewitt, please go ahead, show us where you saw it.*

*Dewitt: Sure, it was this way.*

*(sounds of snapping twigs)*

*Sherwood: Jesus it's dark, why did we have to go out here so late?*

*Barker: You scared already?*

*Sherwood: No, it's just, how are we supposed to find evidence, if you can barely see what's two feet ahead of you?*

*Pellington: Well, let me ask you, how do you plan on finding Mothman if you only come out here during the day? We all know he's nocturnal.*

*Sherwood: Never mind.*

*Pellington: And you all have your flashlights, right? That should be enough.*

*Dewitt: You actually want to find him?*

*Pellington: Of course, why else would we be here?*

*Dewitt: You wouldn't say that if you saw what I saw.*

*Barker: What was that?!*

*Pellington: What?*

*Barker: Just a bat or something.*

*Sherwood: Sure it wasn't Mothman?*

*Barker: Well, if it was, I'm sorry to disappoint you all, he was a lot smaller than people said.*

*Dewitt: Let's just keep going alright? I don't need you all making a lot of noise.*

*Sherwood: 10:26 pm, we're now deeper into the woods, but no sign of the old bunker and nothing unusual so far. It keeps getting darker, I seriously doubt we will find anything in these conditions.*

*Pellington (talking to the camera): … getting close to the exact spot where Ace Dewitt saw the creature himself. I suspect it lives in one of the bunkers, which is why it hasn't been discovered so far. But now that it's leaving its nest again, we might actually get a decent chance of finding it.*

*Sherwood: About that, I've been meaning to ask you, if this thing is really out here, how do you explain that the sightings just stopped one day and only spiked again recently?*

*Pellington: I believe it went into some kind of hibernation and is now coming out to feed again.*

*Sherwood: For ten years? What kind of creature hibernates this long?*

*Pellington: Cicadas do something similar, don't they? They stay underground for up to seventeen years before they emerge. This might not even be the original Mothman, but it's offspring that hatched only recently.*

*Sherwood: But if the original Mothman died, it's body would surely have been discovered and analyzed by scientists*

*Pellington: Not if the government got it first. They put a lot of effort into keeping these sightings quiet, wouldn't they do everything they could to secure the body? That way no one finds out they're responsible. Maybe they even captured it alive.*

*Sherwood: Of course, the government. They must also be the reason why- Look!*

*Pellington: What?*

*Sherwood: Did you see that?*

*Pellington: Where?*

*Barker: I heard it!*

*Sherwood: Up there! Did you not hear that? That howl?*

*Barker: I did, what was that?*

*Pellington: I don't know.*

*Dewitt: It's here! It's back!*

*Pellington: Put that gun down! Sherwood, what did you see?*

*Sherwood: There was... huge wings! Right up there! Did none of you see that?*

*Scarberry: I saw it.*

*Pellington: You did? Is it on camera?*

*Scarberry: Sorry, it was too fast.*

*Barker: That deep howl. Did you hear that?*

*Sherwood: Yes, I think I recorded it. Dewitt, did you hear it? Do owls sound like that here?*

*Dewitt: I'm not going in there.*

*Pellington: Which direction did it go?*

*Sherwood: There.*

*Pellington: Is that where the bunker is? Dewitt?*

*Dewitt: Yes.*

*Sherwood: Should we go on?*

*Pellington: I... I don't know.* 

*Barker: Isn't that the whole reason you came here?*

*Pellington: Are you sure that's what you saw?*

*Sherwood: I don't know what I saw. But if we want to know, we have to keep going.*

*Pellington: I suppose you're right.*

*Dewitt: I'm not going.*

*Sherwood: But none of us know our way around here. Without you we're all lost. And you have your gun. Last time you scared it off alone, remember? This time there's five of us.*

*Dewitt: Fine. It's this way.*

*(The next several minutes are only the sound of us moving through the woods. No one said a word, but I kept the tape recorder running the entire time.)*

*Dewitt: There it is.*

*Sherwood: We've reached the bunker. It almost looks like a small hill, but it has two rusted doors on the front. One of them looks like it was broken open. Let's go in carefully.*

*(sounds of slow footsteps)*

*Pellington: Are you getting this?*

*Scarberry: Uh huh.*

*Pellington: Do you see anything inside?*

*Sherwood: It's pitch black.*

*Dewitt: Hey, did anyone see, uh...*

*Sherwood: Oh my god, look at this!*

*Pellington: What?*

*Sherwood: On the door.*

*Pellington: Hey, get a good shot of this!*

*Scarberry: Are those?*

*Sherwood: Scratch marks. Were those here before?*

*Dewitt: No.*

*Sherwood: Be careful with that gun. What could have done that?*

*Pellington: They're huge.*

*Sherwood: We should check inside, but careful. Dewitt, get your rifle ready.*

*Pellington: Look.*

*Sherwood: What?*

*Pellington: Shhhhhh. Eyes.*

*(several seconds of silence)*

*Sherwood (whispering, barely audible): What is that?*

*Pellington: It's getting closer, shhhh!*

*(a repeated clicking sound is heard)*

*(silence)*

*(screams, several gunshots, then rapid footsteps)*

*(recording cuts out briefly)*

*Sherwood (out of breath): What was that?!*

*Pellington: Just get in the car!*

*Dewitt: I warned you!*

*Sherwood: Wait, where is Barker? Barker! Woodrow!*

*Barker: I'm here, just go!*

*(sounds of car doors closing)*

*(end of recording)*

Sherwood wrote down the following later that same night.

*Tonight, I saw something I cannot explain. My hands are still shaking. We went out into the woods, Pellington insisted we go at night, because he hoped to actually find Mothman. At first, I was frustrated with this decision, but then I was the first to see it. It flew right over the top of the trees, with its huge wings stretched out, and it let out this deep howling sound. I have never heard anything like that. It should be audible on the tape recording I made, but I'm still too shaken to even check it. We continued in the same direction as it flew and found the bunker Dewitt described. Like he said, one door looked like it was broken open by force and as we got closer, we saw three huge scratch marks in the rusted metal of the broken door. Dewitt said they were new. Then Pellington told me he saw a pair of eyes. I looked up, and there they were. Two red eyes, staring at us from behind the bunker. We all stood there in silence. This thing was slowly crawling towards us and made a strange, insect-like clicking sound. As it reached the top of the bunker, it stood up on its hind legs. Still, I couldn't see many details in the dark. It was vaguely human shaped, but it appeared to have had a kind of thick exoskeleton. On its head, next to its huge red eyes, were two long antennas, barely visible. Also, I think it had more than two arms, but I'm not sure. We only saw it very briefly, because a few seconds after it stood up, it unfolded two huge wings and flew straight towards us. Dewitt started shooting at it and we all fled back to our cars and drove away. I think Pellington's cameraman might have gotten a good shot of this thing but I'm not sure. Especially with how dark it was. I guess I will find out tomorrow. For now, I should try to go to bed, but I doubt I'll get much sleep.*

Apparently, this encounter was recorded by Pellington's cameraman George Scarberry, but from the recollection of the event and later descriptions of the film itself, it's clear that this is not the famous Pellington film but an entirely separate piece of footage. Trying to find this film didn't yield any results either.

This next part was crossed out with a pen, but you can still read what it says.

*It's 3:38am, I just got up to get some water, when I looked out the window and saw a large dark figure with red eyes sitting on the streetlight across the street. Almost as soon as I saw it, it flew straight up into the night. My heart is pounding. Maybe this was just an owl, maybe my sleep deprived mind is playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn that I just saw the Mothman staring right into my hotel room. I'm too exhausted right now, I will figure out tomorrow what to do next.*

*October 12****^(th)****, 1976*

*It has taken me a lot of coffee, but I have finally gotten myself awake enough to properly digest the events of last night and think about my next steps. The plan so far is to first go back to the scene of the sighting, this time at day and search for evidence. We will definitely be able to get better pictures of the scratch marks this way and hopefully discover some more evidence that this creature might have left behind. Secondly, I'm going to interview everyone who was there that night to get their sequence of events. Maybe someone spotted something that I have missed. I already asked Pellington about the film, he has sent it to be developed and assured me that his cameraman did his best to film the Mothman we saw. He also agreed, if somewhat reluctantly, to go back to the bunker with me. I also called Barker and Dewitt, Barker agreed to come along as well and actually took a photo of Mothman himself that is also currently in development. Dewitt meanwhile was so terrified of what he saw that he left town entirely to stay with his sister, at least until the sightings quiet down again, he told me. He did however, give me his sister's phone number, so I call him to tell him “if we get it”. Can't really blame him for leaving, I suppose, I thought about doing the same, but my curiosity ultimately won. If we can prove what we saw, it would be the scientific discovery of the century. And we already managed to collect some good evidence, especially if the film shot by Scarberry turns out good.*

 

Transcript of Sherwood's second expedition back to the bunker where Mothman was seen.

*Sherwood: 10:34 am, we are back at the spot where we entered the woods last night. With me is John Pellington and his cameraman Scarberry.*

*Pellington: Is Mr. Dewitt going to come along as well?*

*Sherwood: Oh, sorry I didn't tell you yet. Dewitt left Point Pleasant for now, that encounter was too much for him, I suppose. I already told Barker.*

*Pellington: Too bad, I was wanting to ask him some more questions about last night. Did you see if he actually hit Mothman with his rifle?*

*Sherwood: No I didn't, but that's a good thought, we might be able to find some blood.*

*Pellington: Should we go? I just hope we're safe during the day.*

*Sherwood: Just wait a bit, Barker wanted to come along too, he's late.*

*Pellington: Let's just go, he'll know where we are. Is the camera ready? Everything we find out there has to be properly documented.*

*Sherwood: I brought my own camera too.*

*Scarberry: Camera is ready to go.*

*Pellington: Good, let's go.*

*(sounds of snapping twigs)*

*Sherwood: What are you gonna do with your documentary? I'm guessing you didn't expect to get results this quickly.*

*Pellington: To be honest, I didn't think I would find him at all. A lot of people already looked and none of them had any luck. Right now, I hope that by broadcasting the evidence we have, I'll get the attention of the media and especially scientists, so they can study this thing properly. Of course, only if the government doesn't shut it down first, which they'll probably do.*

*Sherwood: We still don't know if they're actually behind this. I mean, couldn't it just be some undiscovered species? There doesn't need to be some big cover up.*

*Pellington: I wouldn't be so sure. What about the article you're writing? Would be pretty difficult to frame this whole thing as a hoax now, wouldn't it?*

*Sherwood: It's still possible, although I admit, it gets less likely by the minute. As I say, part of being a skeptic is having an open mind and if we get enough evidence, the Skeptical Inquirer might just have to publish its first article arguing in favor of Mothman's existence.*

*Pellington: Wait, you still think, what we saw might have been someone in a Halloween costume?*

*Sherwood: As I said, less likely, but still possible. I suppose I have an open mind about that too.*

*Scarberry: Well, I saw it up close through the camera. That was no costume.*

*Sherwood: Let's just see what we find today.*",2,1762698354.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I've had Share beans--sure not bad but not even close to the Six Depot cup. Had Shelburne Falls for years---tastes like coffee shop coffee--nothing particularly ""pissah"".  Yup was much like Shelburne (for me) it just doesn't stand out. Deans Beans (same as Shelburne, Yup)

Yet to try Iconica, Tunnel City, Circuit (westfield), Catalpa, Ilse, Sacred Grounds, Futura.
