1ha1bam,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1ha1bam/just_looking_for_friends_25f_california_usa/,"Just Looking for Friends! 25F California, USA ","I’m a girl from Northern California, I like pretty basic things. I like to read, write, draw, watch tv or movies, I like to talk about too many different things at once and go on long drives. I like to listen to music but in the way where you feel it, you know? I love music that I can feel. I like dogs and cats, any pet really. I’d hug a bear if it didn’t naturally want to maul me. I love meaningful poetry but I also love things that make me laugh. I like to send too many snaps and keep streaks going even though it’s absolutely useless and has no value to it. I like to learn—maybe it’s the pressure? I love the pressure. I like tea just as much as I like coffee. Beaches still amaze me even though I live in California because they are so far from me. 

I like to play games, on my PC and sometimesmy switch. Sometimes I stay up all night talking to my friends around the world on voice chat and that’s perhaps the worst thing I could do as a full-time worker. I do make up as a hobby among many other things. I'm super crafty. I'm currently a Director in marketing. 

I think what I’m looking for is someone that I can just message all day or whenever? I often spam silly messages or serious messages, or somewhere in between. I’m not completely spectacular,  but I am a friend. I can talk to you about anything and everything. I’m consistent, always loving. Almost always forgiving. I love creative people. People who know how to carry conversations equal to me. 

Maybe I’m your new best friend? If you’re from a different country, I don’t mind. I actually really love meeting people who are drastically different than me. Someone asked me before if I’m in a relationship, I absolutely am and I am with the love of my life. I am looking for only platonic friendships. Message me.

1ha19zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALS/comments/1ha19zf/als_has_claimed_another_angelhusband_don/,ALS has claimed another angel...husband Don,"The Legacy of Love 

As I sit here at my desk, reflecting on everything that has come before, I realize something undeniable: Don’s life, his illness, and the journey we shared together have left an indelible mark on my heart. His legacy is not just in the things he accomplished or the life we built—it’s in the love that remains. It’s in the lessons that are now woven into the fabric of who I am, and who I will continue to be.

When I think about Don, I no longer only think of the ALS, the tubes, the doctor’s visits, the difficult days. Instead, I think about the man who loved deeply, laughed loudly, and fought tirelessly—both in his battles with the disease and in the way he lived his life. I think about the man who never let anything define him except his integrity, his love for family, and his unwavering desire to be the best man he could be, even in the face of a terminal illness.

His legacy, I now see, isn’t just about how he fought ALS. It’s about how he lived. It’s about the strength he showed in the most vulnerable moments, the grace he exhibited even when the world seemed cruel. And it’s about the love he gave—unconditionally, deeply, and without hesitation.

I will carry that love with me for the rest of my life. It’s a love that doesn’t fade with time. It doesn’t stop with death. It doesn’t end because we can no longer hold hands, share a laugh, or sit together in silence. The love we shared is still here, in my heart, in my memories, in the quiet moments of reflection that remind me of him every single day. And it is a love that will continue to shape who I am, even as I move forward without him physically by my side.

Don’s legacy is also in the lessons he taught me. The biggest lesson of all, I think, is the importance of cherishing the small moments. We tend to rush through life, caught up in the noise and the chaos, but Don taught me that true beauty lies in the quiet moments—the ones we often overlook. The moments of connection, the laughter over a cup of coffee, the times when you hold hands without saying a word, simply knowing that you are there for one another. These are the moments that matter the most, and they are the ones I hold most dearly.

I’ve also learned that love, real love, isn’t just about the good times—it’s about the hard times, too. It’s about showing up when everything else seems uncertain. It’s about being there, in sickness and in health, not because it’s easy, but because you are committed to the journey, no matter how difficult. Don’s illness tested me in ways I never expected, but it also deepened my understanding of love. Love isn’t always perfect. It isn’t always easy. But it is always worth it.

I often think about how I will carry Don’s legacy forward. In the beginning, it felt impossible to imagine life without him. But now, I see that his legacy is alive in everything I do. It’s in the way I show up for the people I love. It’s in the kindness I offer to others, the patience I give, the laughter I share. It’s in the way I choose to live my life—not in spite of the pain, but because of it.

Don’s battle with ALS changed me. It changed both of us. But the most beautiful part of that change is that it brought me closer to who I am meant to be. I’ve learned that I can face the hardest of challenges and still find meaning in the journey. I’ve learned that, even in loss, there is the opportunity for growth, for healing, for hope.

As I continue on with my life, I do so with a sense of purpose—a purpose rooted in Don’s legacy. I know that he would want me to continue to live fully, to love deeply, and to find joy even in the face of hardship. And so, I will. Because, in the end, that’s what he taught me: life isn’t about avoiding pain or seeking perfection—it’s about embracing every moment, holding onto the love that remains, and carrying forward the lessons that come from the people we love the most.

Don may no longer be physically here with me, but his legacy will continue to live on through me, through the people he touched, and through the love that will never die.

This, I believe, is the greatest gift he could have given me—the knowledge that love is eternal, and that, in the end, love is what defines us.

And so, I will honor Don’s legacy by living a life that reflects the love he gave to me—a life filled with kindness, laughter, and, most importantly, the unwavering belief that love is the greatest force in the world.

1ha196r,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/1ha196r/queens_residences_thoughts_and_opinions_based_on/,Queens Residences: Thoughts and Opinions based on 2024-25,"**Some info: WARNING VERY LONG!**

The summer before moving in, i made a list ranking all the residences based on videos and pictures. I partially considered locations and reviews i had heard...HOWEVER, after actually moving in, the ranking order had *completely* changed because there are SO many pros to buildings i placed really low, and there are many cons to the buildings you'd place higher based off impressions online. So, here i will simply state the facts about some buildings and let you decide, because in truth there is no *real* ranking order once you start living here, i promise. 

**Brant and Smith:** 

Yes they are single plus, and yes they are really nice. These are in my opinion at a prime location on campus. There is a little area right around ""Location 21"" where there are a lot of the residences, and these sit in the middle. They are popular for their study spots in the common rooms. Brant has the prettiest view of the water i have ever seen, studying on the couches and tables in the common room is SO nice. A lot of my friends gather up to study at the smith common rooms, and it is literally on top of Loco (Location 21). This is more convenient than you might think. In the winter it can get so cold to go anywhere that the buildings surrounding Loco are very lucky. Great location for life-sci students who have all their morning classes on West campus, bus stop across the street. 

**Morris:**

Right beside brant, and across the street from smith/loco. I don't know why people call it stinky morris. It has never once this year smelled bad. It's smelled like construction or had a distinct smell, but so does any house you first walk into. I am defending this building with my life. I've been told my single room size is bigger than other residences too often. It's true. The queens website also lied about the elevator and single user washrooms. There is an elevator, very spacious too. Even though bathrooms are labelled as communal, *single user* ones do exist. My friends and I haven't showered in a communal shower all year. There are two on the ground floor, I can't speak for other floors though because I haven't checked. But if this was a concern, they do exist. This res has been live this year. Morris Mosh is a thing. Basement hangouts. Hallway parties upstairs on weekends during the first months. However, this does depend on the people who move in each year, but know there is potential. Great location for life-sci students who have all their morning classes on West campus, bus stop across the street. 

**McNiel:**

Sorry can't tell you much. Almost all doubles in here. Never heard anything bad tho. Location is right beside brant (they go in a line btw... morris,brant,mcneil,leonard) so the benefits of location still apply. 

**Chown:** 

Got friends here they like it. The showers are very convenient i'll tell you. Single user, toilet and shower in seperate little sections so you don't have to wait for somebody to finish. It is on the same street as Leggett and Smith, a little bit higher up. It's kinda in the middle of the two main points you'd always be. There's a shortcut to Victoria hall (which is where you will always go for food ""the lazy scholar""), and its close to university avenue and the main bus stop, so very convenient when you are late for class. The carpets are a little annoying to me because i am a neat freak, but its overall clean, on the quieter side, people here are nice, and the vending machine has some really good snacks. Has elevator, and pretty big common rooms. 

**JDUC:** 

John Deutsch has my heart. I don't think this one was even available last year due to construction, half the people i talk to have never even heard the name before. It's single plus. But get this, the washrooms are not even shared between two people. Your own washroom, in your own room, which gets cleaned every two weeks by the cleaning ladies. Wow amazing i know. ***Pros***: luckily for incoming students, they will finish building an elevator and they will not have to walk up those stairs. Literally right beside the two best places on campus. To the right, it is connected to Mitchell hall, which has starbucks. Behind it, the Arc, where you have Tims, Booster juice, pizza place, two other food places who's names i forgot... a grocery store, a pharmacy, and the GYM. The huge amazing gym (five floors and a pool btw <3). To the left you have stauffer library, where you will spend most of your time if you like a nice study sesh. And last but not least, in front you have Douglas library, another cute spot to study (the harry potter library). As you can see, location 10/10. Each floor has a study room covered with glass walls to write on, a large table and spinny chairs. It's open concept and students use the walls as white boards, very nice feature. Super modern, the common rooms have nice couch and tables. Kitchen is super new. We host movie nights there and bake cookies while watching horror movies, nobody really bothers you so its nice. **Cons**: Super isolated from other residences. The only one up there in that corner. The first 3 floors are under construction as I write this, so less people, naturally less social. This building has a lock for every floor, so even if you wanted to go explore you have to live on that floor or bring a friend to open the door. This kinda ruins the fun because you meet people less. Some other residences have a similar idea but with the elevators where you need a key to use the elevator, but at least each floor is accessible. Idk, i think this makes it even lonelier in the beginning. 

**Victoria Hall:**

Y'all. I'm rubbing my temples right now. No complaints on the rooms or washrooms. Lazy scholar, the food place, is right beneath your building. Open till 1 am. Burrito bowls and nachos are the best. they have a grill and breakfast options like donuts tea and coffee. Pool table there, which you can borrow the sticks for and play with friends. This is the amazing side. As somebody who did not live here, orientation week, warm days, and events like Hoco and Halloween which are happening here, are very fun. Huge crowds. Entire lobby flooded with people. Sometimes theres a speaker and people dance outside. Basically where everybody gathers because vic is known as the party res. Now, the reason i was rubbing my temples is because this is a **nightmare** for somebody living here who likes to study, relax, and sleep. Nice to visit, different story to live here. Yes you make friends and people are super social. But on halloween there were 7 fire alarms in one night, my friend came over at 2 am to sleep at my dorm. One went off at 7 am on the second day of exams. Fire alarms go off almost daily in september, because people pull them. they had to start putting ink on the fire alarms to track who keeps doing it. Sleep during the first few weeks there is a blessing. The hallways are always loud. People are talking loud or doing something like quiet hours don't exist. Again, if the social pros outweigh the noise, suit yourself. 

**Gord Brock:**

I hear rumors this is the last year it will even be open, because it's old. But there have been multiple social events here during the year, ping pong table in common room. Right behind morris and brant. Directly beside leonard dining hall, lucky fatties. Right beside water and has nice view. Close to the bus stop going to west campus and the opposite end of campus. Can't say much else, got no friends here.

**Waldron Tower:**

No complaints about rooms. Super isolated. Never hang out there even though my two friends live there. They are always forced to come to the little area with residences to either get food from leonard or to go to class. They often bus, and the schedule is not always convenient. If you are on west campus though, it is the furthest, BUT, the bus comes from their direction and you are guaranteed a spot. People near smith line up for the bus and often don't make it on. I have had the doors close in my face 4 times, and in the summer i didn't even bother waiting and just walked. West campus classes are a nightmare, but anyways. Technically if you make it on the bus the distance doesn't matter much. They have a lot of storage and sinks. Waldron tower extension doesn't have the storage wall that the main part does, this is what the photos show online. Look at youtube tours for a more accurate tour. 

**Leggett and Watts:** 

Watts has a gorgeous common room, and all mail goes there for pickup so i guess you don't have to walk to pick up a package. Leggett is near smith but I just don't know much of what goes on there. Locations are also in the main bubble you wanna be in near other residences. 

**Leonard:**

Tbh i've heard complaints. Being connected to a dining hall would make me happy but idk. It's right in the middle of the residences, near vic and all the food places near there. Not really known for being social. My friend says it's okay but her room is really nice. Almost an entire wall of storage and bookshelves. Somebody pooped in the shower tho lol. 

**ET:**

I don't care that this is a single plus. I am not joking when I say, that in the entire first semester, I walked by this building once. I have nothing else to say. I hear and see nothing. 

**West:**

.....The dining hall is nice...........to visit.....................................when i'm there.......once in a while........

I do Renaissance faires and set up my camping gear for about 16 weeks a year—8 weeks in the spring (March/April) and 8 weeks in the fall (October). I’m in Texas, so the weather is usually warm, but not unbearable. This year, I’m looking to upgrade my setup and am considering a yurt—specifically one from White Duck Yurts.

I plan to use it as a place for people to hang out after hours at the faire. I’d like to set up a record player with speakers, a chandelier hanging from the top for lighting, a phone charging station, and possibly a coffee setup.

I’ve never used a generator before, so I’m looking for recommendations on quieter generators that could handle everything I’ve listed. Ideally, I’d like to find one under $400 if possible. Has anyone had success with a generator in that price range for a similar setup?

Finally, I’m also curious:
	1.	Does anyone have experience with White Duck Yurts, or would you recommend another brand for something durable and good for this kind of setup?
	2.	Any suggestions for other ways to make the space comfortable and functional for after-hours relaxing?

2. Badminton battle - Are you ready to show off your badminton skills? Let's hit the courts together and have a thrilling match. We can challenge each other, improve our game, and have a great time while breaking a sweat. Don't worry if you're not a pro—having fun is what matters most!
3. Fancy dinner/coffee date - We can choose from a variety of culinary destinations, ranging from cozy bistros to fine dining establishments. Perhaps a coffee date is more your style. It's the perfect setting to get to know each other better, share stories, and enjoy the warm ambiance.

**A little bit about me:**

* I'm a 21 y/o female who enjoys living life to the fullest (as much as possible). I consider myself to be an easy-going and realistic person. I'm an undergraduate student currently studying in Manila. As a student, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, both academically, personally and socially.
* I believe that physical attributes are just one small aspect of who we are as individuals. While I'm proud of my appearance and take care of myself, I believe that true connections and friendships are built on shared values and interests, not just physical attraction. That being said, I'll share a bit about my physical attributes. I'm a shortie girl, short hair, and ""morena""
* I also enjoy exploring other ways to stay active, such as badminton, swimming and lil bit of volleyball. I believe that staying active and challenging myself physically is not only good for my body, but also for my mental health and well-being.
* I'm someone who chooses not to drink, smoke/vape, or use illicit substances. I personally prefer to live a lifestyle that aligns with my values of health and well-being.
* I value authenticity and genuine connections.

What am I not looking for?

* I'm not looking for someone who is overly aggressive or disrespectful. I believe that mutual respect and kindness are the foundation of any healthy relationship, whether it's romantic or platonic.
* I'm not interested in someone who is only looking for a casual fling or hookup. I value meaningful connections and deep conversations.
* As someone who values honesty and integrity, I want to make it clear that I'm not interested in getting to know any man who has a history of cheating or being unfaithful in their past relationships.

You come home everyday in your freshly carved potato car (which I assume operates just like a Flintstones car) after a long day of organizing logistics of potato farming at your office made of potatos, the job isn't to hard in fact things run themselves. The biggest issue you face is that weird slimily substance you get on your hands after handing a peeled wet potato. 
 On the drive home each day you think how can we solve the that potato texture before giving up and admiring the view of the potato Rockies. It's cold, but nothing your north spud jacket can't handle. 
As you get out of your car you realize you haven't smelled anything besides the smell of uncooked potatoes since you were a wee lad, it makes you a little sad, but it's Idaho so what can you do. After planting your car into the ground for the night.
You walk into your house which I assume you went with Full as opposed to the chopped for the uninitiated it looks like SpongeBob's pineapple but it's actually just a giant potato. 
You walk in to your wife (actually she's just a potato shaped as a woman, she's hidden it well and you still haven't found out yet) who just finished making dinner steak and greens (it's against the law to eat Potatoes in Idaho) she hands you the newspaper and a warm mug of vodka before giving you a tender kiss on your cheek. 
You look at the paper and see the Trailblazers entire front court is out with injury, for game 7 of the WCF. You think it's odd because you swore the season just started a month ago but think you must've just lost track of time. You reach for the remote for your Spud Vision and realize the game is already on and it's the fourth with the Trailblazers leading. Your in your lazy clothes sunk deep into your Lay - Z - Spud. You grow deeply concerned because hours of time just passed in seconds you call for your wife that you affectionately call ""Tater Tot"" (seriously how have you not noticed this yet)
She doesn't respond, you call for her again louder and more forceful to no response before crying out begging for her or anyone to hear you ""TATER TOT I NEED YOU IN HERE RIGHT NOW""
She affectionately appears at the door unfazed by your screams. You stare at her puzzled at how calm she is and why she's completely done up to do house work with her big blonde hair, big beautiful blue eyes and polka dot blue sun dress ""Oh did the Blazers win the championship?""
You turn to the TV ""NO, it’s only the WCF....""
Before you see in the Blazers dribbling out the clock against the Celtics to win the title in a sweep.
You stand in disbelief knocking over your coffee table
Your wife approaches you ""be careful now, let's not make a mess."" Her eye falls out as she reaches for the table. 
You look back at the TV in frenzy to watch as the team celebrate as they jump up and down with the trophy, as Shaydon Sharpe reaches to hold the Larry O'Brien his skin falls off revealing he is just a potato, all the players start turning into potatoes and then slowly everyone in the crowd becomes potatoes.
It finally all makes sense ""ITS NOT REAL"" you scream over and over again. ""THERE'S NO WAY THIS CORE CAN WIN A TITLE!!!""

You start to regain your sanity, you see your in a straight jacket in a mental facility. You need to escape and start banging your head on the door 
""IM SANE""
""SHAEDON SHARPE IS NOT BETTER THAN ANTHONY EDWARDS!!!""
""ANFREE SIMONS IS NOT GOING TO DEVELOP!!!""
""SCOOT HENDERSON IS A BUST!!!""
“CHAUNCEY BILLUPS DEFENSIVE STRATEGY IS INADEQUATE”
Finally someone hears your cries. He is wearing an all white decontamination suit carrying a big lumpy bag taps the glass, lets out a huge sigh

Today my son is 19 wonderful months but I am struggling with unmanaged ADHD and chronic fatigue. I can sleep 8+ to 11+ hours and still feel like taking a nap of I'm sitting too long or standing. Just always down for a nap or sleep. Sleepy after food. Sleepy after coffee. Zero energy whatsoever. 

Prior to my baby I had managable symptoms..heck! I didn't even realize I had ADHD. Not only is my ADHD symptoms very noticeable and unmanageable I am wondering if it's more auADHD....

Anyways, I did suffer with PPD rage, PPD depression and anxiety for several months. I didn't start to recover from the rage and depression until my son was about 16 months - for 16 months I was on a SsRI, Vyvanse , PPD therapy and individual counseling. I stopped the SSRI and Vyvanse after 5 months of use because I was still incredibly sad and tired. 

I read that low estrogen might be the solution to managing ADHD in combination with ADHD medication. Does anyone have any experience or insight they would like to share ? I would be freaking thrilled to be a functional human again. I do plan to restart my Vyvanse now that my depression has lifted.

# What is the Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program?

The *Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program* is an audio-based course designed to help men master the art of flirting and have attractive, engaging conversations with women. This program focuses on developing a natural, authentic style of communication that builds attraction and comfort, all while avoiding the dreaded friend zone. If you're looking to improve your conversation skills and connect with women on a deeper level, this course promises to be a game-changer.

# Who Should Consider the Flirting Master Program?

This program is perfect for men who struggle with talking to women or feel like their conversations lack that spark of attraction. Whether you're trying to impress on a first date or build a lasting relationship, the *Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program* provides actionable tips and techniques to make you more attractive through conversation. It's not for the guy who already has the conversation skills down pat or for someone who doesn't plan on taking action. If you’re someone who finds himself getting stuck or nervous in conversations with women, this could be the perfect course for you.

# Why is This Program Different?

Unlike other courses that teach you to memorize lines or ""routines,"" the *Flirting Master Program* encourages you to be your authentic self. The focus is on building natural rapport with women and creating genuine attraction through conversation. This course doesn’t turn you into a socially awkward robot but rather equips you with the tools to confidently engage with women in any setting. Whether you're meeting someone online or in person, you'll have a strategy to keep the conversation flowing smoothly and build a deeper connection.

# Where Can You Use the Skills from the Flirting Master Program?

The skills you’ll learn in this program can be applied anywhere. Whether you're at a coffee shop, a bar, at a party, or meeting a woman through an online platform, the *Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program* prepares you to engage with women at any time. The beauty of this course is that it’s not just about using pickup lines but about understanding the flow of conversation and knowing how to keep things interesting. This means you’re ready to make an impression anywhere, at any time.

# How Does the Program Help Improve Your Conversations?

The program is divided into five main modules, each designed to build on the other. It starts with teaching you a three-part formula that must be present in every conversation with a woman. If any element is missing, the conversation might fall flat, but with this formula, you’ll have the right balance of attraction and comfort. The *Conversation Flow* module is key, where the instructor breaks down how a conversation unfolds, giving you a roadmap to follow that feels natural and engaging. The additional modules dive into common mistakes to avoid, pro tips to amplify your flirting, and even advanced techniques to add spice when necessary.

# What Will You Get Out of the Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program?

By the end of the program, you'll be able to hold conversations that spark attraction and keep women interested in you. You'll learn how to avoid the mistakes that typically kill attraction and replace them with strategies that keep women engaged. Most importantly, you'll be able to express yourself authentically while still creating that ""wow"" factor. The course will transform how you interact with women, ensuring that each conversation leaves a lasting impression and moves the relationship forward. Whether you're looking for a one-night fling or a long-term connection, this program can help you take your game to the next level.

In short, if you’re serious about improving your flirting skills and connecting with women in a more meaningful way, the *Attract and Keep Her – Flirting Master Program* offers the right guidance to help you do just that. No more awkward silences or missed opportunities—just smooth, engaging conversations that attract and keep her interested.",1,1733715551.0,ComaxLearning,1,1.0,False

**Returning this**:In C++, this is a pointer to the current object (the instance on which the member function is called). It allows you to reference the current object within its methods. An example of this is like customizing an order at a coffee shop. You start by choosing the drink type, then add a size, extras like whipped cream, and finalize the order—all while building on the same order without restarting. Similarly, in programming, methods can return this to allow chaining of operations on the same object.

1) what is my direct experience 

2) What is my awareness of the experience 

3) what is the story I tell myself about this experience 

4) How can I soften and simplify this story 



i. My Direct Experience: 

Ex falsely accused me of sexually abusing my 8 yo and 5 yo. I haven't seen them now for two weeks and trial is in another week. Still wait on CPS to do their thing 

My awareness of my experience: 

Feeling hopeless, defeated, exhausted and burnt out. This has been going on for almost 4 years. I'm stuck scrolling for information on defending against false information. I'm not in the waiting phase where there is nothing I can do. This feels helpless, and powerlessness. My anxiety takes me to notions that I'll never see my girls again. 


The story I tell myself: 

My ex has won. I should of never tried to hold her accountable in court. This is what I get for filing emergency emotions when she takes whole holiday weekends away from me. Everyone will believe her. The teachers, our friends and eventually my daughters. They'll never see me as a good Dad that fought so hard for them. Maybe it's better I'm not in their life. Seems like the Mom just needs to fully take over and I just pay child support. I'll miss them. I always wanted to be a Dad. Maybe when they're 18 we'll reunite, and maybe they'll understand. I should of never challenged my Ex. She is too smart, and the system favors her. This is never going to end, so mightiest well give up now. Save money and find some smaller joys like coffee in the morning and hikes on the weekend. The Forensic Psychologist is for sure going to buy into the coaching your Ex has done to your girls. The GAL's will also turn against how. 

How can I soften and simplify this story:

I'm not a perfect victim, but nonetheless a victim of abuse and parental alienation at the hands of my high conflict Ex. My girls are too young to know now, but they can eventually. Especially if I continue to be the opposite of what my Ex says I am. Overall, the facts are my Ex doesn't have a great track record of being a credible and trustworthy person in Court. I mean I was awarded temporary legal and physical custody for 4 months earlier this year. My girls need me to fight. They need to have one stable parent and they are deserving of this.

1ha0lgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1ha0lgo/bugs_ive_encountered_so_far/,Bugs I've encountered so far,"1) Furniture workbench disappears. After I finished crafting furniture, placed it, and got back, it just disappeared. Had to make a new one.
2) Many objects in the world seem to be having Z axis value lower than intended. They are halfway in the floor/shelf/dresser.
3) I am on 230th day, I lived 20 days with the last update in Pleasant Valley. I still did not face cougar or any signs of cougar. I traveled plenty, also got to Bleak Inlet + Forlorn Muskeg. Also it seems all the wildlife are at the same place where they were before refresh. Same spawn for bears, wolves, moose. For 20+ days.
4) Some small items that are placed in the world can dupe. For example, I placed matches box on the shelf, and then, when I tried to move them with RMB, I started moving, but there was a copy of them in the initial place from where I started.
5) Some decorations can't be placed. For example, Christmas lights can't be placed on walls, I had to place them only on ceiling light in Farmstead in Pleasant Valley. Also, they don't work in Aurora if you moved them :(
Also, I got sign ""Aid Center"" from Water Facility in Mystery Lake, and I can't place it on the wall in Farmstead. It just always says invalid location. I also can't place pictures on the walls that are near the stove in Farmstead in Pleasant Valley, only near the other entrance.
6) I couldn't mark Poacher's camp on Forlorn Muskeg on the map. I tried many directions and angles, just impossible, I unlocked both Vistas, see the whole map, but still can't.
7) Bugged achievements. I got achievement to collect all DLC weapons after I left Forlorn Muskeg through the Cave. I have only 3 DLC weapons out of 7 right now.
8) I lost lots of fish and dockworker's pies outside of my base. They just disappeared. Other dishes are okay, even though they are placed at the same place.
9) Some junk items (plates, kettles, glasses) respawn after I destroy them with Y. Also they float in the air.
10) Some items are not movable/destroyable through Y. For example, toaster, or radio (not trader's one).
11) Repair UI when there is two items needed to repair (bear bedroll, travois) is broken. Sometimes, second item is shown way above its supposed place. Sometimes, second item required to repair is not shown at all, but still is mandatory.
12) Sometimes, when you place a decoration, it also places them with some items attached. For example, I was trying to put Christmas Lights, and with them I was placing 3 cups of coffee first time, and 8 feathers the second.
After you place it, you can get back those items",3,1733714922.0,thelongdark,3,1.0,False

Stay wasn’t perfect but everything worked, worked well and got me where I needed to be.

Booked for 23k points a night as a Globalist (advance point booking) when hotels were very expensive for Miami Art Week and felt the points were well spent. I had heard some negative reviews of the property (pool not open, restaurant not open) but maybe they were doing renovations to be ready for this weekend because all of that was there?

It still seemed like they were doing construction (stairs didn’t really lead between floors) but I never really noticed it or any noise or dust

Location is pretty excellent imo (as befits the brand), 15 minute walk to Art Basel, 5 minutes to the beach, with free beach chairs and towels included each day. Pool seemed nice, though only open till 7 and no hot tub.

The place was sold out so no globalist upgrade, but I did get a fairly tasty and large portioned free breakfast each day for 2 including maybe 6-8 choices, a side and coffee or juice. Also got free parking which manager let me use for a friend who was staying the night, which was likely 50 bucks or so otherwise given the event.

King bed room was nice, one of the larger beds I’ve gotten at a Hyatt (cal king?) with a sliding door shower and bathroom, studio apt style. Everything in the room was clearly very new: appliances, bed, lights, waterfall shower. Housekeeping did a great job each day freshening the room.

My only real complaint (not their fault) was that the Joe and the Juice downstairs was somehow converted to a rave for Art Basel weekend which shook my whole room with bass but hard to do anything about that at 1am and not the hotels fault. However, they comped some wine we got at the bar without me asking which I thought was sweet.

Overall, this is not a luxury hotel but that’s not the brand (Hyatt Centric). I felt this was a great hotel for walking and exploring Miami Beach, great for beach access and getting on/off South Beach and a tremendous value on a weekend where I saw hotel rooms costing thousands of dollars.

With the Andaz Miami opening and the GH being built nearby, I may check those out, but I felt this hotel (clean, great service, nice amenities, central location) was a great choice and one I may come back to if fun takes me back to the nice weather and breezy promenades of South Beach again.

Also, if anyone has em, happy to answer questions",3,1733714790.0,hyatt,2,1.0,False

1ha0je5,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ha0je5/college_is_so_lonely/,College is so lonely,"When I was looking at schools to apply to, I told myself I wanted to go somewhere with a decent social scene, about 10,000 or so students and near a big city so I could force myself to come out of my shell a bit and meet new people. I actually had many friends in high school, but I was always pretty nerdy and usually the last guy somebody would think to invite to something. So, I wanted to try and reinvent myself at college. I started off by picking one of the more socially active dorms on campus and I was lucky that I got into it. I was super excited to find out who my roommate was going to be, because I thought I had pretty good chances that they would be interesting and fun. Once I saw his instagram, I realized that wasn't going to be the case. Okay though, no big deal, you don't have to be friends with your roommate. Then comes the first week and I realize not only do we just not click, but he's just a really bad roommate, and really awkward with all the other people on the floor too. I met some people the first week, one really cool guy I talked to for a bit actually lives on my floor, but we drifted after the first week. I met a girl in one of my freshman groups, too, but we also drifted after getting coffee twice. I kept on telling myself to try and go out to meet more people, but I don't even know where to go. I joined a magazine on campus as a writer and I actually really enjoy it, but nobody really talks to me. I want to a party for the magazine and just sat in the corner all night not really talking to anybody. I've been here for months and I don't have a single friend. I have no reason to leave my dorm after classes, to go outside, to go out on weekends. When I have a problem, I have nobody here to relate to with, when something good happens, I have nobody to share it with. Everyone else on my floor seems to get on great with their roommates; every evening when I'm walking to use the bathroom I pass a common area where I've watched a friend group of 4 people form. In one of my classes, I watched the two people who sit in front of me break the ice and ask each other out in less than four months. There are days when I don't even open my mouth to speak, because I have nobody to speak to. Tomorrow is my birthday; when I wake up I'm going to get a text from one of my friends back home telling me happy birthday. Then, I'm going to have a bowl of cereal by myself in the dining hall, do my laundry, read a book, and wait until my parents get out of work to call them. They'll tell me happy birthday, then they'll ask if I got my exam scores back yet and whether that issue with my account was resolved. After that I'll go to the gym, shower, and be in bed by 9. That phone call is going to be the first time I've spoken with anybody in about a week, and then I'll go back to silence.",10,1733714731.0,college,7,0.92,False

We have been together for 15 years and I would say I have been doing 95% of everything in the house myself. He helps occasionally/half heartedly.. meaning never without being asked at least a million times. This is anything! Even the freaking trash. He will walk by the full trash can and not bat an eye for a week straight until I say hey can you take the trash out.. and maybe he will do it at the point… or maybe he will just walk past again and say yep when I get back from xyz. By the point he knows I have forgotten and he also has. I do all of the actual cleaning in our house (bathrooms, floors, any kind of kid toy mess clean up, laundry, cleaning the yard up, cleaning the garage up, cleaning the vehicles out) I am freaking exhausted. I also own my own business and work just as much if not more than he does. We have 3 children together 13,8,4. I am constantly doing a million things for all of them. And him… he wakes up he has his coffee he goes to work. I wake up get 3 kids lunches and me and him lunch.. get kids to school and then get to work. Work all day then pick up our daughter at 5pm.. all 3 kids are in dance/sports.. he does come to practice. Mostly sits on his phone except for at hockey. I am just overwhelmed/exhausted.. don’t know how to make him actually see I need help with our house and our kids. I never take a break for me. I never leave the house unless it’s for work or with the family. 😭 we don’t have real dates. If we go on a date his friends come with. And it always involves drinking. He’s short tempered with me and the kids most days. Has horrible road rage when we go anywhere. I have talked to him 1 million and 1 times nothing helps. Sexual favors don’t work. Literally just at a loss here. Please give real suggestions if you read this far. Or just tell me I’m doomed that’s pretty much the conclusion I’ve come to. Maybe just needed somewhere to vent it to. 😭

tl;dr -husband is a shithead and doesn’t help with the house, has short temper, basically I’m doing everything alone but he thinks because he’s “here” that’s enough.

Love to play basketball. I own and operate a full service tree service. I use to love to drink energy drinks and coffee and eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. Until a November of 2023….
So my journey began November of 2023… I was in my kitchen and had unthawed some smoked chicken and threw it in the microwave. I took it out and put decent size pinch of it in my mouth, chewed it up and….. it felt stuck… took a small drink of water and that make it worse I went into a panic attack thinking I couldn’t breathe and the water basically filled it all the little gaps and instead of going down it made an impaction. I was about to cough it up finally. Scared me to death I thought I was dying. Life went on and every now and again I would get that same sensation mostly with meats but I had it happen with several things. Even Mac-N-Cheese. 
March of this year “2024” we welcome our
newborn into the world! I knew I had to get this under control because it was ruining my mental health. I had a visit with my doctor and he prescribed me omeprazole 40mg once a day for what he believed was silent reflux and also some anxiety medication. I didn’t take the omeprazole routinely as the bottle said at first because i honestly didn’t believe I had any type of reflux because I never had a burning sensation in my chest, never had any reflux at all unless I ate a ton of junk food and deep-fried food. In that case I would wake up with a burning acidity sensation in my throat… I would drink a small glass of milk and it would be gone. This was only was in a blue moon that this would happen. I couldn’t handle the anxiety meds because they made me feel like I had the
June- I underwent the procedures and when I woke up that’s when my life changed. During the Endoscopy they found a size 4mm hiatial hernia, Shatzki ring also known as a stricture or narrowing. Mine was a ring like structure closer to my LES- “ Lower Esophageal Sphincter”.  They Made vertical incisions in the ring and then dilated my esophagus to 20mm and then gave me a steroid shot in my esophagus to prevent stenosis. They took biopsies of my esophagus and sent them off. While performing all of this my esophagus was very red and irritated. Onto the colonoscopy.. everything came back clear for the most part other than internal hemroids that they weren’t too concerned with because they weren’t very big and a polyp that was non cancerous. 
After waking up from the procedure they told me everything that went on and told me I could return to a normal diet…. So I did. 
On my way home from the hospital we stopped and got Captain D’s. I had a two piece fish dinner. No issues eating everything went down. I went home took a nap because I was out of it due to the anesthesia. When I woke up we had chicken Alfredo… this is where it all started. Third bite in I felt my food get stuck but I was able to wash it down with water. I had developed these weird burps as well that felt like trapped air that I couldnt hardly get out. It sent an adrenaline rush to my chest and my face. My heart rate was all out of whack. This caused a panic attack. I had a nurse friend I called that was able to keep me calm and I ended up going to bed and sleeping it off hoping everything was just irritated from the procedure. The next weeks to come I couldn’t hardly swallow anything. It was like where they had done the procedure and cut into me had gotten swollen and almost swelled shut. I lost almost 20 pounds in 2 weeks. They couldn’t figure out what was going on so they just upped my dose of omeprazole to 40mg twice a day with taking carafate every 4-6hrs. This just made me feel worse. I felt sick all the time. I just wanted to sleep and didn’t have any energy. I was worried I was about to starve to death from a procedure I thought was going to be simple and my life would return to normal. My biopsy’s had come back but they messed them up somehow??
I I believe it was about a week after not being able to eat anything other than protein shakes and even that I had to just sip it because I would choke, I went up to OSU Medical center and they admitted me and told me the GI doc wanted to see me in the morning. So I stayed. The next morning the GI doc comes in and says “ hey I looked over everything and I reviewed your recent procedure and we agree with everything that’s been done. You’re free to go whenever you’d like. “ I said look I just stayed the night so I could get some answers… is there anything we can do or test we can run to see what’s going on. They done a barium swallow test. Everything looked normal aside from when they had me swallow the barium pill and it stopped right where the shatzki ring was located. That wasn’t supposed to happen. The ring should’ve dropped down into my stomach. They said it was more than likely still inflammation due to acid reflux. Also my results from the biopsy of the esophagus came back and there was some kind of 
July-my GP took me off omeprazole and put me on one 20mg vaquenza a day. Very strong anti acid medication. Im still dealing with the weird burping of what feels like trapped air. Still feeling everything I eat and drink as it goes down. Making a little progress. At this point I can eat eggs, I would cook them over easy and dice them up as fine as I could. I did this majority of the month of July and into August. 
August- still dealing with all the same symptoms for the most part but slowly adding in softer foods and chewing everything extremely well and taking small bites. Have to wash every bite down with a drink. I was starting to add my energy drinks back in as I didn’t know if they were the culprit or not. Towards the end of August I had a set back and chocked of food again. I quit drinking caffeine all together. Wasn’t sure if it was causing my set backs. 
September- I was having some side effects with the Voquenza which was stomach pain. 
I started taking omeprazole 40mg twice a day again. Toward the end of September I lowered my dose down to one 40mg a day. And started to notice a difference. Was finally able to eat some stuff. I had to chew it up good but I didn’t feel it going down as much as I had before. 
October - I had to have another endoscopy to see how everything was healing up from my procedure. My throat wasn’t irritated anymore but the area where he performed the procedure on my shatzki ring was still kind of swollen and irritated. They sent off biopsies again to make sure I didn’t have EoE “which came back that I didn’t have”. 
That was a huge relief.  Oct7th I ended up getting mono was sick thru November. 
I started second guessing all of the omeprazole  wondering if it was causing my body not to be able to fight off certain things. So I lowered my dose to 20mg a day. 
I’m now feeling better and healed from mono but starting to be able to feel some of my food as it goes down. I also still deal with the weird burps. I call them deer burps because it sounds like a deer grunt. But they’re painful. I just want my life back if possible or to know how to cope with this. I did learn that the pain in my stomach I was dealing with due to PPI’s is from constipation. I’m considering trying a different PPI or talking with my GP about seeing what I can do with this hiatal hernia if it’s the culprit.

1ha0buk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ha0buk/second_chance/,Second chance?,"My ex and I broke up (my decision) after seven months because I felt myself spiraling into a dark place and feared slipping into depression. While I’m not afraid of emotions, I can’t afford for my mental health to decline (financially or otherwise). I need to stay stable to keep up with my job, business, rent, and bills.

Despite the short time together, this was the most authentic, loving, and respectful relationship I’ve ever had. I love him deeply, flaws and all. He’s kind, smart, compassionate, and attentive. I felt truly seen, heard, and loved with him, and I have nothing negative to say about who he is.

He struggles with depression and takes antidepressants, which meant some periods were better than others. I tried my best to meet his needs, but when he was down, he withdrew. I responded by putting in even more effort, which left me feeling like I wasn’t doing enough. Instead of understanding, I started to hyper-fixate on my own feelings of inadequacy. It became overwhelming, especially while balancing a new job and a business in a demanding city where I live alone.

Looking back, I wish I had been a steady, silent support for him rather than interpreting his struggles as rejection. I broke up with him because  I felt like I was adding pressure instead of helping, so I ended things to protect us both. Now, I can’t stop thinking about him. I’m consumed by regret, replaying every conversation and wondering what I could have done differently.

He told me he loves me and is open to a coffee, but he won’t try to change my mind. I don’t know if breaking up was the right decision or an act of self-sabotage out of fear. All I know is I still love him with all my heart, and being awake feels like hell.

He moved into the apartment downstairs from mine four months prior and we were just ... immediately very close and stayed that way. I think his parents may have been a lot like my parents.

We had rituals: hollering from upstairs to downstairs out a window ""did you see what
NVDA just did?!?"", letting him borrow my cat for I-had-shit-day time, Wednesday Cajun steamer seafood night, and a standing order for one to grab the other coffee if either of us hit Dunkin.

After both spending three years as recluses is during Covid separately, to finally live within hollering distance of someone… we were fast friends.  

When he hadn't been answering his phone at 11am, his mother requested I check on him ...  Peeped in his basement apartment window and saw him still laid out on his bed and not responding to noise. 

I booted out his window and gave CPR to his dead-since-last-night corpse until the ambulance arrived.

I’m also including the picture of the paraphernalia and shit I found all tucked in a fliptop trash bin next to the desk.  The cops took two little envelopes they found on his desk, but other than that, they weren’t going to investigate it further, and then I found all that stuff in a plastic bag.

His mom was coming from another state and I decided to take the bag of crazy-level drug stuff and toss it; I felt duty-bound to not let her see that.  Maybe to let her remember him the way he was.

If you're not gonna quit, keep it away from people you love, so they don't have to find you like this and carry the weight around.

1ha05f5,https://v.redd.it/z1t5pgftnq5e1,Kruti Coffee’s Mumbai Blend,"Aamchi Mumbai Blend ☕: A Sip of the City

@kruticoffee ’s Aamchi Mumbai Blend—crafted especially for the Mumbai Coffee Festival—carries tasting notes of chocolate, honey, and brown sugar. Sounds dreamy, right? The recipe to brew this coffee was provided by barista’s at Kruti coffee, so to understand what they wanted us to experience from this coffee I used the same recipe! But here’s my honest take on the coffee:

While the coffee showed promise, I mostly tasted the dark chocolate tones, and even those were on the milder side. The aromatics were subtle, and the overall experience felt… okay. It didn’t particularly wow me, even when brewed at different grind sizes and temperatures. And with milk? It tasted decent but didn’t stand out there either.

Now, don’t get me wrong—coffee is super personal, and what didn’t work for me might just become your new favorite. That’s the beauty of coffee: every palate is unique!

1ha04si,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1ha04si/im_looking_for_a_gift_for_my_boyfriend/,I'm looking for a gift for my boyfriend,"Hi! (and thank you in advance)

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 11 years, living together for almost 5 years (wow, I didn't even realize before I typed that...time goes by fast). We're in our mid 30s. 

He's a huge board gamer and used to be a pro gamer (MtG) / pro e-gamer. He's now a developer. 

My problem is: I'm a terrible gifter. Most of gifts for him are hit or miss. Gifting him games is always a bad idea because as soon as he wants something he buys it and he knows more about the upcoming stuff that he might want than I do. So I tried gifting him stuff related to gaming like clothing with his favourite characters on it, wall art that represent his interests (for his office). I also gave him over the years stuff related to shows that we watch or that are inside jokes. I also tried alcohol related gifts because he was a mixologist for awhile too. 

There aren't a lot of gifts that I gave him that made him very happy. I wish I could find something that could make him light up. Something he himself wouldn't have thought of but is wicked cool. For example, I drink a lot of coffee and used the same electric drip coffee makers my entire life. He got me this very awesome coffee/tea maker that allows you to make normal tea/coffee, cold brew, over ice, etc. and selects the proper steeping time and temperature for different types of tea (white, green, herbal, etc.). I would have never thought of that machine and I wouldn't have bought it for myself (because of the price) anyway even if I did stumble upon it. It's one of my favourite gifts. He also gave me a pink gold Samsung smartwatch, which I would have never bought for myself because I'm all ""What do I need a smartwatch for? I have a smartphone!"", but now I wear it all the time.

It was a very long context, sorry. My point is: 

For a minimalistic man in his 30s who loves board games, (some) video games and technology in general, dislikes ""practical"" gifts, what gift would have that ""wow! omg! I never thought of that, but many thanks!"" effect?

1ha04ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ha04ha/the_most_dangerous_animal_that_humans_have_is_apig/,The most dangerous animal that humans have is a...Pig?,"Terra 2, also known as Phylua, was the second of three worlds found and colonized by the humans of Terra Prime after the great galactic migration and technology revolution that was spearheaded when the members of the high council in the intergalactic congression offered the humans to join them. When the great treaty of the stars was formed and signed, humans were given access to all kinds of new and amazing technology that allowed their society and science to advance hundreds of years into the future. From there, they searched far beyond their own galaxy to other planets, where they found Terra 2 through 4. Three planets that revolve around the same star and are all within the habitual zone, possessing an atmosphere and gravity similar to Terra Prime while also being devoid of any intelligent life or any life currently.

Though the Terrans may think of themselves as the ones to find Terra 2-4, it was the intergalactic congression who silently gifted to them as a show of goodwill and because the council couldn't find anything of value on or to do with the planets. Terra 2 was a planet of vast flat grasslands with several freshwater rivers and small lakes dotting the surfaces. Terra 3 was a world that was one giant ocean. Terra 4 was much like Terra 2 but had a few scattered and active volcanoes that made the dirt very fertile. All three worlds were also set in a constant state of spring, summer, and autumn, with no winter.

These three worlds were to be turned into what the humans coined as Agir-worlds. These were entire planets solely dedicated to the production of food, with each planet holding only a few million residences to keep production going. Terra 4 would be used for the production of crops, Terra 3 would be used for the production of fish, and Terra 2 would be used for the production of animals. This plane was laughed at and mocked by the rest of the high council, but the humans didn't care.

Since humans didn't currently have enough manpower to spread their people between Terran matters, galactic matters, and running the Agri-worlds, after their population was reduced by 80%, they allowed many different xeno species to join them to help run the food worlds in exchange for a cut of the profits, a.k.a food. And that is where once such xeno finds himself.

Hisska is a member of the snake-like xeno species known as the Hireophants. When erect, they're about as tall as humans but far longer, with some reaching 20 feet in length. They resemble the various nonvenomous snakes of Earth with just as many colors and patterns. They have a human-like upper torso with arms and four fingers, with two acting as thumbs, but they have longer necks and move on their serpentine tails. What they lack in venom, they make up for in crushing body strength, which is how they catch and kill food in their home world of Scatha. Also, according to Terrans, he looks like a corn snake.

Unfortunately for Hisska, he was in a bit of a predicament. Before coming to Terra 2, he was in between jobs, and finding employment in a place like this was one of the last places he would go to. Unfortunately, he had exhausted all other options, so this was the best he could do. He was okay with the year-round warm temperatures, but he didn't like the constant hustle and bustle of this outdoor type setting. He much preferred a nice, comfortable, quiet, and warm office space. But he had no choice since every time he got a new job; he was 'let go' due to 'managerial reasons,' which was just a nice way of other xenos telling him he was fired for being a deathworlder.

Yes, the Hierophants were considered a deathworld species. Most employers only hired deathworlders with a class of 4 or below. His home world was a class 5. He knew it was all BS since he had seen several Terrans working in his previous jobs, and they had a deathworld class of 15! He just knew they were too scared of them to do anything, the jerks.

He had been on Terra 2 for four lunar cycles, which is what the Terrans called a month, and he hated it for many reasons. Sure, there was the physical labor, noise, and constant movement. Still, he also detested three other things: a terran creature called a chicken that would not stop following him around, the smell and noise of the many animals, and this one exceptionally overly friendly Terran called Michael. Michael, or Mike, as everyone called him, was kind, bright, cheerful, always full of energy, and was Hisska's self-proclaimed best friend. And Hisska hated him! He wasn't his best friend or any friend, as the Terran would follow him around like the chicken and talk his ear hole off all day long. Only his perception of Mike, as well as most things, would get flipped on its head one faithful day.

When the sun rose on Terra 2 like it always had, sunlight threatening to peek past Hisska's curtains, the orange and cream-colored snake slept peacefully in his heated bed with the curtains closed to allow him a bit more sleep. He had hoped he could skip the day and rest for as long as he could. After all, what was one day off? Except that never got to happen for the tried snake as the curtains were ripped open, allowing daylight to pour in as a very similar and annoying voice woke him up.

""GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MORNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING! RISE AND SHINE SLEEPY HEAD! UP AND ADAM!"", Mike yelled in his usual cheerful voice as sunlight flooded the room and threatened to burn his eyes through his eyelids.

Hisska groaned as he arched his head under the covers, complaining, ""For the love of the Great Hole of Laxeia, Mike, there is nothing *good* about the morning.""

""Oh, don't say that! Mornings are always wonderful! The sun is singing, the air is warm, the wind is cool."", Mike stood him while pulling the covers off his body.

""It's always like that, Mike. Phylua is in a constant state of eternal spring."", Hisska shot back while covering his face in his tail.

Mike pouted at the snake and asked, ""Must you be a killjoy?""

Hisska looked between the spaces of his coiled body and hissed back, ""Must you wake me up at this unholy hour? Let me sleep."" Then, he coiled himself around his own body to block the sun.

Mike looked at a nearby alarm clock, which read 8:00 am. So, he puffed out his cheeks and shook the pile of snake while saying, ""And miss the day? If you don't work, you don't eat. That's the rule. Besides, I made you coffee."" Mike said in an enticing tone while holding a piping hot cup of joe near the coils. Hisska's tongue flickered out until his nose and whole face poked through, and Mike said in a more enticing tone, ""One cream and five sugars, just the way you like it.""

Hisska then grabbed the cup with a look of disdain as he stared daggers at the wryly smiling man. After he took a long sip from the brew and admitted, ""Despite the many weird things you Terrans do, I have to admit your craft in beverage creation is top-notch.""

""I also made you a hardy breakfast to start your day,"" Mike said in a chipper voice while placing a warm plate on his coils. Three boiled eggs, a slice of Texas toast with raspberry jam, and rat bacon!"" Mike told him the contents of the plate.

""Rat bacon?"", Hisska questions.

""You do eat rats, don't you?"", Mike inquired, looking a bit worried.

""We do, but it's still a perpetuated stereotype. You Terrans, in fact, all xeno species, think that all we ever eat is vermin. We have a more expanded diet."" Hisska stood him while rolling his eyes before taking a slice of rat bacon and swallowing it up. He said, ""Besides, rats are high in fat.""

""This coming from the guy who can swallow an alligator and live off the calories for a week,"" Mike joked as he slapped his back, nearly making the snake cough up its food.

After rubbing the spit from his mouth, Hissak gripes, ""Oh, please. I've never swallowed anything that couldn't fit in my hand. Aren't humans able to run 30 mph, hold their breath for several minutes, climb trees, and scale impossible surfaces?"" he questions back with a knowing look.

Mike puffs out his cheeks and admits, ""Fair point.""

""And if the no work, no eating rule is true, then give one of those alligator things so I can sleep and not work for a while."", Hisska tells him while inhaling his amazingly delicious breakfast.

Hisska could say whatever he wanted about this place, the work, and the people, but he'd be frozen to death on a summer day before he admitted that the food here wasn't the best he'd ever tasted!

Mike rolled his eyes as he pulled him off the bed, telling him, ""Oh come on, it's just a saying. Now go and get ready, Mister Lazy Scales! We have a big and busy day ahead of us!""

""When is it ever not."", Hisska complained as he finished his coffee and watched Mike run out of his room.

Hisska's entire grooming session consisted of washing out his mouth and face, picking off any scrapes of skin he didn't shed, and putting on a shirt. Usually, his kind went around in the nude, but since many other civilized species wore clothing, they, at the very least, wore a shirt as a commodity. The one he currently wore was one of the many white and blue plaid button-down long-sleeve shirts that everyone wore. After sighing and accepting the stress and grief he would get from this day, he finally slithered out of his room, into the hallway, and out the door of one of the many different shared homes built and being built on the planet.

Once he was outside, he had to use his second lens to block the glare from the sun, and when he did, he caught sight of Mike from behind, waiting for him. Even though Hisska had seen him tons of times, he always found him so strange from every other planet. He was like any other young adult terran on the planet, tall, fit, with sunkissed skin, but he only wore overalls with no shit or shoes and a straw sun hat that covered his curly blond hair. And right now, he was eating an apple while waiting for Hisska. Mike caught sight of him and threw the half-eaten apple over to a nearby donkey, who caught it in its mouth and waved him over.

""Come on, Hisska! The day waits for no man!"" Mike called out to him, mouth half full of unchewed apple.

Hisska slithered over and griped, ""I am no man.""

Mike rolled his eyes as if Hisska was teasing him and reiterated, ""The day waits for no man or snake! Let's get the stalls ready for the milking cows.""

Hisska growled a grumble and followed after the young man, knowing full well he'd either get dragged or Mike would follow him. As the two walked along each other, Hisska saw how, even though it was very early for him, the large township that had been recently created was already fully awake and well into the usual hustle and bustle of the day. People come in and out of their homes with work clothes, food, fresh-made goods, people on farming machines, carrying farming equipment, herding or carrying animals all around. And it wasn't just people; it was several dozen species of different xenos of all kinds, walking, talking, and working in the early morning sun. To Hisska, it was way too much all at once! Even in his home world, there was so much sensory overload and clutter!

Hisska had to dodge several other xenos, starting with an Araneae, a spider-like xeno, who was holding several cages full of quail to a modified aviary in his spare hands. A Zylous, a tailless lizard-like xeno, was holding a screaming peacock in their arms. Finally, a young Fleeklin, a cat-like xeno, ran over Hisska's tail with a basket of eggs as a gaggle of geese chased after him. Hisska grumbled under his breath about everyone having no concept of personal space despite the planet being nearly flat and a few other things.

Luckily, the crowd managed to separate a bit as they continued away from the busier parts and part from Mike and the craziness of the morning; the day was going pretty well overall. So maybe today wouldn't be so bad. Until a familiar sound was caught in his earholes, and his body shook with a mix of fear and anger. He looked over to the side and realized that he had not so sneaky moved past a chicken coop\[ with a certain chicken coming out to follow him yet again. It was a New Hampshire Red hen who would begin to cluck loudly and widely at him, trying her best to get his attention, keep pace with him, or climb upon his tail.

All the noise got Mike's attention, and as he ran around, he said with a bright expression, ""Oh, look, your little friend is joining us!""

Hisska tried to shake the bird off him and whip it away with his tail but to no avail. So he grumbled as he once again resigned himself to his fate and growled in a deep hiss, ""Why does this dumb bird keep following me?!""

""She's imprinted on you."", Mike answered.

""Excuse you?"" Hisska inquired, becoming distracted by the absurdity of the statement.

""You were the first thing she saw when she was a chick, so she thinks you are her parent."", Mike explained, thinking he didn't know what imprint meant.

""Don't kids usually leave their parents at some point?"" Hisska argued, and the chicken finally jumped onto his tail and rode on it.

""I guess she just really loves you."", Mike offered with a chuckle.

""Super, but the sentiment isn't reciprocated."", Hisska grumbled as he rolled his tail, causing the bird to flutter off.

The two men then entered one of the temporarily constructed barns, a large square building made of metal tubes as support and a metal roof with walls made of a thick plastic sheet that prevented the animals from attempting to break through it by tricking their eyes. Inside was a small herd of around twenty heads of dairy cattle. From there, the two worked as a team to move and set the animals in proper positions. Mike called the cows as he opened a divider gate to allow them into the milking area while Hisska took a bale of hale and a bucket of feet, shaking and pounding both into wooden troughs that went both sides down a single walkway.

When the cows heard the feed and hay being dropped, they raced to their normal spots and poked their heads through the head clutches to start snacking. From there, Mike would go through the walkway behind Hisska and close to head clutches so they wouldn't run off. And after Hisska was done dropping the food, he would go behind each cow and hook up the nipple suckers onto each udder of the cow, allowing the automated machine to do all the work. Once all the cows were being milked, the two took a break as the calves ran around and played with each other or tried to eat what their mothers were.

As the two men waited for the machine to finish the milking process, Hisska had to do everything within his power not to stick out his tongue and smell the air. No matter how useful these creatures were, they stank like no tomorrow! Any time he suggested they should be bathed regularly, he was told it wasn't cost-effective. So, as he waited to wrap this part up so he could leave, Hisska tried to avoid his natural urges. And thinking about his old complaints made him want to complain.

So he turned to the one person he could complain to without reprimand and griped, ""Can you explain to me why Phylua is being used to produce more of these large, ugly, smelly animals you seem to admire so much?""

""Haven't I already explained it?"", Mike asked back.

""Yes, and I still don't get it,"" Hisska said back, regretting every second he opened his mouth.

""It's called foresight."", Mike told him, simply making the snake give him a confused expression. So Mike sighed and explained to him in more detail, ""Look, when we humans mess up, especially when we do it really bad, we take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. Or at least mitigate the problem.""

""I don't get it."", Hisska tells him.

Mike gave him an 'are you kidding me' look and regaled him as three class true to suckle on his hands and feet, ""Long before the Intergalactic Congression brought us under its wing, Earth was having a hunger crisis all over the planet. Then, when World War 3 wiped out 80% of our total population, the hunger pandemic was a thing of the past since all those hungry mouths were dead.""

""Touching."", Hisska said rhetorically.

""So we thought, gee, even though we almost caused our own extinction, we'll eventually bring our numbers back up one day, so we may as well get it right. And that's where Agri-Worlds like Terra 2 come into play. Our whole mission is to turn this entire planet into one huge ranch to make food for the people of Terra Prime. Pretty soon, this whole planet will have billions of livestock and barns that will reach across the horizon!"" Mike told him with a starry-eyed gaze as he looked out before the row of huge, smelly megafauna used for milk and meat.

""Okay, I understand now, I think."", Hisska told him, as he didn't want the man to suddenly break into another of his famous rants about the future grandeur of this planet.

The milking machines stopped, the tubes fell off all the cows, and the two men got back to work. Mike and Hisska opened the head clutches on each cow, letting them go, and once they got down the line, Mike opened a back gate and allowed the cows to go out to pasture. Hisska made a hasty retreat from the smell pen and took in the non-animal-filled air! Mike came behind him soon after and gave him a bucket while he grabbed a wheelbarrow and shovel. He knew their next job could only be one of two things: cleaning poop or feeding the chicken, and he really hoped it was the poop!

As they walked again, Mike struck up their previous conversations and told him, ""Ya know, you're one to talk smack about our animals. Your planet's ecosystem is totally wacky. I mean, you have freaking owl monkeys and parrot monkeys.""

""I find them pretty normal and tasty."", Hisska argued back.

""Because you live there,"" Mike said with a laugh as the two of them approached the chicken coop, making Hisska grimace.

From the day he came here, several people told him that many of the birds might be scared of him since snakes are a common predator of the bird of Terra Prime. Only for the exact opposite to happen, and now every bird seemed to like him or *really* like him! Just before they entered the coop, they stopped by the feed shack and fille the wheelbarrow up. They went into the free-ranged area, and the moment Hisska started to scoop and lay down the food, every bird from chickens, ducks, geese, and guinea foul began to swarm him from the food he spread around. With the same hen from before always following him.

Mike could see Hisskas displeased expression and told him, ""You know, you don't have to work here. You can always go work somewhere else.""

""I would if I could, but no one wants to hire me because '*Im a deathworlder*'!"", Hisska hissed at him with venom in his mocking voice.

Mike shot him a confused look and said, ""But isn't your home world only half the size of Terra Prime and only covered in flatland jungles, and aren't you the uncontested apex predator?""

""Apparently, that's not enough."", Hisska griped while rolling his eyes. Hisska then looked around the free-ranged area, then to the horizon in all signs, and then to the sky, where he inquired, ""Follow-up question: if this world is so important, why aren't there any planetary defenses? We're out in the open here. What if we get invaded?""

""Well, that-."", Mike began to explain as the two of them left the coop, only to be interrupted by someone calling Mike's name.

""Mike?! Mike!"" called the voice of an older man who finally caught sight of him next to the nearly eight-foot-tall snake alien. ""Oh, there you are!"" the man said in frantic relief.

""Hi Dave, is something wrong?"", Mike asked the older man.

Dave took a moment to catch his breath and fan himself with his farmer's hat. He then vaguely told the young man, ""He got out again.""

Hisska was confused, but Mike instantly knew what he meant and said in an exasperated tone, ""Oh geeze, what's Rupert gone and done this time?""

Dave then waved him on to follow, and despite his better judgment telling him not to, Hissk followed after. Dave took Mike to another feed shack, where several people were surrounding it and trying to pull something out, but with no luck. Hisska could only guess what was in there from the awful sounds it was producing while eating and screaming when grabbed. Looking inside the shack, Hisska saw one of the Terran called a pig munching down on several open feed sacks. Every time someone tried to poke or grab the hog, he would squeal loudly and snap at the m only to return to the food. Even though his ear holes were only meant for picking up simple sounds, the way this thing chewed sounded awful!

""We've been fighting with him for several minutes but can't get him to budge."", Dvae said with a defeated sigh.

Mike pushed the people off to the side and assured them, ""Okay, stand back; I've got this.""

Everyone watched in awe as Mike casually strolled into the shack, grabbed the pig by the side, and pulled him out like a naughty child. Rupert oinked and grunted in irritation at being pulled away from his all-you-can-eat buffet but ultimately came out to where someone could close and lock the shed. And Rupert wasn't any ordinary pig; he was a true beast! He was far bigger and hairier than most other pigs, including other boars! He was six foot ten inches from snout to tail and so tall at the shoulders that Mike, who was standing above him and guiding with his legs, had to walk on his tiptoes! But he was an excellent breeder, which is why he was kept for all the trouble he caused.

Mike cooed and stroked and rubbed the creature, saying sweet nothings about how good it was, how big it was, how silly and fat he was. A bunch of stuff that made Hisska want to vomit more than the stench of the creature! Holding back his vomit, Hisska told the man, ""I still can't believe you can talk to and control that monster with such ease.""

""He has a name."",m Mike told him with a playful glare.

""I can't believe you named it."", Hisska said back with an unamused tone.

Mike just rolled his eyes at him like he was joking and told the pig, ""Come on, Rupert, let's go back home.""

Mike then threw his legs off the animal but kept a hand on his back as he was led back to the pig pen. The part of the pen he was being put back into was a holding pen that held fifty hogs before the pasture, where they could root and graze. This holding area had what looked like a raised stage before entering the pen below, which was used for one purpose. Putting escapees back into there without the others getting out.  Mike led Rupert onto the stage and gently pushed into the pen with the other colorful hogs.

Getting the pig back in safely, Mike clapped his hands and wiped his forehead. Hissak looked out at the sea of swine and commented, ""I still don't see what you find so appealing about these creatures.""

Mike then gave him an excited expression as he began to rant, ""They are awesome! They're super clean and super smart, and-woah there!"", Mike suddenly yelled as he grabbed Hisska by the back of his shirt and pulled him back onto the stage before he slipped over the lip and into the pen. Hissak wanted to be angry with him, but seeing the scared expression on the man's face, he didn't. Once Mike caught his breath, he told the snake, ""Phew! The last thing we need is for you to fall in. You'd be gone before I pull you out.""

""Pretty sure that's just a rumor. Speaking of which, I've heard one about you recently."" Hisska quickly changed topics before he went back into his 'How awesome is this animal' rant.

Mike rolled his eyes and told him while snapping one of the steps of his overalls, ""Yes, I do wear underwear under my overalls. Im not a pervert.""

Hisska shook his head and waved his hands, saying, ""No, I mean, are you related to the two human political delegates who basically run Terra Prime?""

Mike put on an expression of realization and stated in explanation, ""Oh, that! I am, but we're more like third cousins? We don't know each other very well. Actually, I know the older brother personally; he is the one who gave us half the animals here, but it's not the same thing. Plus, they don't run the planet; they're just very influential and work mostly on galactic matters in the high council. And it's the younger brother who handles political matters.""

""That's disappointing. I was hoping to use them through you to get me another job,"" Hissak said, looking down at the stage.

""I'll see what I can do."", Mike said with a chuckle as he bopped the snake's nose, making him glare at the man. As the two left the pig pen and walked off to their next job, Mike asked his snake friend, ""So, what were we talking about before?""

""Planetary defenses."", Hisska replied without missing a beat.

Mike slapped his head as he and Hisska grabbed an apple fork and bucket while heading for the orchard, ""Oh, right! Well, we don't need those. Terra's 2-4 are perfectly safe where they are. We've got that huge cosmic storm that surrounds and encases the planets and sun like a fence. And the only ones who know how to get in or out safely of it are us, Terra Prime, and the Inergaltic Congression. But they hold that secret so tight that barely anyone knows it. Besides, do you know the chance of making it through that mess unscathed?"" Mike asked him as they made it to the first patch of trees.

""1 in 149,681."", Hisska told him once again without missing a beat and started to collect apples.

""Exactly! So we've got nothing to worry about."", Mike exclaimed as he spread his arms in front of the blue sky.

Only for that same blue sky to suddenly be darkened by the show of several spaceships exiting warp drive. The wind stopped, the animals stopped, the sound stopped, and the very planet froze for a moment as Hissak stared up at the massive fleet of ships above the atmosphere. Mike froze in place as the sun on his back went cold, a neutral expression of concern on his face as he slowly turned around to look back at the ship and then back at the snake, where he stated, Then again, I could be wrong.""

Suddenly, all hell broke loose as beams emanated from the ship and brought down an enormous alien that began to cause Havok! They looked like bulls but stood upright on back hooves, were yellow in color, and had four arms and four eyes. They were absolutely brimming with muscle all over as they wore sparse armor to show off their well-made physiques, only wearing arm and leg guards with armor covering their lower torso. This shows they had no fear of being attacked or taking attacks on their bare flesh, which was rough and course like the shell of an armadillo.

As the huge bull alines appeared on the planet, they wasted no time in destroying buildings with their blasters and hand-held weapons, knocking over machines, barrels, and anything small enough for them to throw around, knocking down gates and fences, causing mass fear amongst the animals, scaring and herding the inhabitance into several small groups over the newly made civilization! No one could fight back, seeing as their weapons were farming tools, and any machines they tried to use to run them over were flipped onto their sides! Very quickly, the people were gathered up into one huge group and held at gun and blaster point by the aliens who raised them!

Even Mik and Hisska couldn't escape as they were grabbed and dragged into the group of terrified xenos. Mike finally got a good look at one of the aliens and realized what they were saying to himself in a small voice, ""Minotaurs?""

""They're called Bullafaints."", Hisska hissed at him.

If there was one other thing about Terrans that he didn't like, it was that they always had a weird habit of calling other xenos by some dumb name when they already had one. For instance, he was called a Naga over several times by several Terrans since being here.

As the many species cowered before the hoard of mighty-looking alines, one very muscular individual with a fake eye came to the front and professed in a loud booming voice that silenced all screaming and crying, ""Lower beings! I am Cratornorous! Leader of the Barrok army division of the indomitable Buffain Empire! You are being invaded; for your own good, do not resist. Now, bring me your leader!""

Only for his attention to be drawn when the chicken that followed Hisska around began to try and attack Cratornorous at his massive leg; Cratornorous didn't even flinch or notice until the chicken started to cluck loudly and promptly kicked the bird with one hoof! The chicken screamed in fear and ran to Hissak, who protected it in his tail.

Hisska gulped dry and whispered to Mike, ""Mike, what do we do? Elder Jhona is sick?""

Mike made a thinking expression for a minute before a light bulb came over him as he said, ""Wait, I've got it.""

Hisska gave him a concert expression and asked in a pleading tone, ""Please don't tell me it's another of your *amazing* plans. The ones that either get us in trouble or somehow weirdly fix things?""

""Trust me, it'll work."", Mike said with a wink as Hissak felt dread come over his soul. He then took the front and called out, ""Uh yeah, I'm the leader of the planet.""

Cratornorous turned his hard gaze to the young man and stomped over to him, his seven-foot height, not counting the horns, looming over his six-foot figure. Looking down at him, he commented, ""You look rather small and young for a leader.""

""Yeah, I get that a lot."", Mike replied.

""So, do you agree to give up? It'll be beneficial for your people,"" Cratornorous asked with a sharp-tooth grin.

""Oh, I do give up; you can have the planet and do whatever you have in mind with us."", Mike readily admitted.

A gasp went over the crowd, and Hissak yelled what they were all thinking, ""Mike! What are you doing?!""

Seeing the crowd's reaction solidified Cratornorous's view of him as he snorted and said with a chuckle, ""Very good.""

""On one condition. You can do that, right?"", Mike quickly imputed.

Cratornorous was irritated at the sudden shift in his words but decided to humor him as he asked, ""Alright, dirtling, what would that be?""

Mike puffed his check and crossed his arms at the word dirtling, before ranting, ""Dirtling? Oh, come on, you are calling us by what our planet is called. In our defense, we named our planet before we knew what a planet was. By the time we did, everyone just sorta accepted the name as such.""

Cratornorous stomped his hoof hard enough to make Mike jump, and the huge alien roared in his face as he demanded, ""Your condition!""

""Right, right, sorry. So, well, give up the planet willingly *if* your best warrior can beat the most dangerous animal we have here. He has to beat a small group of them, and they have minor help from me. If he can't, you leave. Does that sound good?"" Mike offered.

The Bullafaints were a warrior race much like the Ungar and lived for the thrill of battle and conquest. Hisska told Mike as much. This would buy them some time, but he really hoped Mike actually had some kind of warrior to pit up against them. Bullafaints were no joke when it came to combat! Tough skin over extreme strength and an indomitable will coupled with sharp horns made them hard for even the most seasoned fighters to take on, even when the Bullafaints were unarmed.

""Done!"", Cratornorous agreed with a smile before yelling, ""Cayrsax!""

Suddenly, a huge Bullafaint, even bigger than Cratornorous, came up and showed himself. He was nine feet tall and had biceps the same size as Mike's head, and Mike was known for having a big head that didn't have much inside of it. Just him standing in front of Mike blocked out the sun for several feet in front of him.

Mike tried to look up at him in the eyes but couldn't get past his massive chest. The only thing he could comment was, ""Wow! I guess performance-enhancing drugs are universal."", and he said this while pointing a thumb at the huge alien.

""This is Cayrsax, our greatest warrior. Now show us his opponent,"" Cratornorous said proudly.

""We're doomed."", Hissak squeaked out.

Mike then brought the huge alien over to the raised stage where the pig pen holding area was set and showed the huge bull alien the fifty pigs that had been linking and squealing up a storm from all the commotion. The whole population was also brought to watch the spectacle before they lost and were taken in by their new tyrants. Mike stepped onto the stage and motioned over the lip that Cayrsax looked over and then between the animals that were far smaller and dumber than him and the young man who gave him a dumb-looking smile.

""What is this?"", Cayrsax growled at him.

""They're called pigs."", Mike answered.

""The pigs?"", Hissak questioned, only for the answer to pop into his head and say with a sinister tone while picking up the chicken he was protecting and stroking it like a cat, ""Oh! The pigs. Clever.""

The other Bullafaints were confused by his reaction but ignored it.

Cayrsax snorted angrily and leaned over to stare Mike in his eyes, his nose ring flapping as he snorted, ""Is this some form of joke? These pink, fat, smelly things are my opponents?""

""Do you see anyone laughing? Im very serious."", Mike said with an equally serious tone.

Cayrsax stood up to his full height and proclaimed loudly, ""Do you know who I am!?""

""I feel like you'll tell me anyway, so go ahead."", Mike offered.

""In your tongue, my name means great hunter! There is no betas that hasn't bested me yet! The death claw, the aquatic lasher, and the flying razor whip all fell before me! What makes you think your pigs can do any better, dirtling?"", Cayrsax boatsed as he and Mike circled around one another as if trying to size the other up.

Finally, after circling one another a few times, Mike got himself and Cayrsax in a spot where the huge alien had his back to the pig pen and his hooves near the lip. He looked down at the alien's stumpy legs and looked back up at him with a terrifying look that made the huge thing flinch. He said, ""Okay, first off, we're called Terrans or Earthlings. And second, this is how!"" with all his strength, he punched the bull in his groan and pushed him into the pen while also kicking his leg, causing it to fold in on itself and fall back first into the hogs!

The hogs dispersed to keep from being crushed by the huge xeno, and only a few seconds later did all the hogs swarm the bull! The pigs oinked and squealed as they climbed over one another and the alien until he was completely covered! Cayrsax let out a blood-curdling scream for several minutes as the rest of the Bullafaints, and Cratornorous looked on in shock and horror, unable to act or move as the screams went quiet and the sounds of the pigs squealing took over! All the while, Hisska and the rest of the xenos all looked away with uncomfortable expressions. Mike stood off to the side and whistled as he waited for the pigs to finish.

After a few minutes of silence, the large boar pig, Rupert, propped himself up on the fence and showed himself with the Bullafaints' yellow blood on his chops and chewing on half of a hand that used to belong to Cayrsax. Mike sat on the stage and petted the pig's head while cooing, ""Good boy, Rupert, good boy.""

The other Bullafaints began to step away in fear from this sight. Mike turned a bright expression toward them that held darkness as he informed the invaders, ""You know, this is just what 50 can do. Wanna see 500?"", the Bullafaints gasped again as Mike stepped off the stage and into the pen, standing straight up and walked to the gate latch where he told them, ""Pigs are pretty smart and teach one another. Once these 50 tell the other how tasty you all are, well...do I have to say it?""

Suddenly, all the Bullafaints screamed in terror and ran off! Some even dropped their weapons as they ran toward the warp zones and were beamed back onto their ships! Within several seconds, the skies were no longer darkened by the ship, and the blue sky showed over Terra 2 once again.

Once the last ship left, Mike yelled to the sky while waving a fist, ""And stay out!""

Immediately, the whole crowd of corraled people began to cheer loudly, and they surrounded the man who hopped out of the pig pen only to be mobbed with congratulations and thanks to everyone! Back slaps, hugs, and kisses were all given to the man as people reveled in their freedom and victory! Dancing, singing, cheering, and crying could all be heard! 

Hisska finally managed to break through the crowd to Mike, and with the chicken on his shoulder, he stated in shock and amazement, ""Mike, that was amazing! How did you know it would work? Bullafaint skin is super tough.""

Mike laughed and told him, ""Pigs will eat anything once they get a taste. All they had to do was break through one part of their flesh, and the rest followed.""

Just then, Dave quieted the crowd and announced, ""This calls for a celebration!"" Everyone roared in agreement with joyful sounds.

The people dispersed as they went to fix the damage done and to prepare for the party.

As the crowd went away, leaving Hisska and Mike alone, the snake looked around at the joy on everyone's faces, reliving the events that just unfolded. With an unsure tone, while placing an arm around the man's shoulder, the snake stated, ""You know, maybe I had you and this place all pinned wrong. Maybe working here won't be after all. Especially if we have Rupter to eat our problems away.""

Mike laughed as he wrapped his arm around the snake's waist and asked in a teasing tone, ""HA! What happened to me using my connection to get you off this planet?""

Hissak thought for a moment and answered, ""Uh, let's put a pin on that for now."", making Mike smile at him as the two joined the rest of the people in the reconstruction and set up for the wildest celebration that would then be turned into a holiday for generations to come. A holiday known as the Feats of the Pigs. And Hisska's mind was forever changed about his new job and the people here, all thanks to the quick thinking and brave action of one man he now called friend.",11,1733713388.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------

When faced with an unexpected survival situation, having common household items at your disposal can be a game-changer. You might be surprised by the many survival uses for everyday objects you already own. Here are some of the most useful applications you can explore, ensuring that you are well-prepared for any emergency.

### Water Purification

Water is essential for survival, and if you find yourself without clean drinking water, several household items can assist you:

- **Coffee Filters:** Use coffee filters to strain debris from water. They can help clear out larger particles, making the water safer to drink.
- **Rice:** Placing uncooked rice in a container of water can help to absorb impurities and odors. After some time, you can strain the water through a cloth for added purification.
- **Bleach:** Household bleach can effectively purify water if used correctly. Add 2-4 drops of unscented bleach per quart of water, mix, and let it sit for 30 minutes before drinking.

### Fire Starting

A fire can keep you warm, cook food, and provide light. Several common items can help you start a fire:

- **Toilet Paper:** This can serve as an excellent tinder. Roll it up and fluff the edges to catch a spark more easily.
- **Candle Stubs:** If you have leftover candle stubs, they can provide a slow-burning flame. Simply melt wax over the tinder to create a fire starter.
- **Egg Cartons:** You can fill each compartment with wax or sawdust to create fire starters. They burn evenly and for a longer duration.

### First Aid Solutions

Being able to treat minor injuries is critical. You can adapt everyday items to assist in first aid:

- **Honey:** This is a natural antibacterial agent. You can apply it to cuts and burns to promote healing.
- **Plastic Wrap:** In the absence of sterile bandages, use plastic wrap to cover wounds. This helps to keep the area clean and can prevent infection.
- **Adhesive Tape:** Use tape to secure dressings or as a makeshift splint for minor fractures.

### Heat Retention and Shelter Building

When the weather turns harsh, your survival can depend on how well you can retain heat and create shelter:

- **Mylar Blankets:** Also known as space blankets, they reflect heat back to the body and are compact enough to carry easily.
- **Cardboard Boxes:** These can be transformed into emergency shelters. Stack them for insulation or use them for padding while sleeping.
- **Plastic Bags:** Fill them with air to create insulation layers for warmth or wear them for rain protection.

### Food Preservation

Keeping food from spoiling can be a challenge, but you can use various household items:

- **Salt:** Use salt not just for flavoring but also to preserve meat and fish by drying and curing them.
- **Vinegar:** A natural preservative, vinegar can help you store pickled foods and keep leftovers safe for longer.
- **Glass Jars:** These can be used for canning and storing food. Ensure they are airtight for maximum freshness.

### Multi-purpose Tools

Several items can serve multiple functions, which is useful in a survival situation:

- **Scissors:** Besides cutting, scissors can also create bandages from fabric and even be used for food preparation.
- **Spoons and Forks:** When heated, metal cutlery can function as tools for digging, prying, or even defending yourself against threats.
- **Rubber Bands:** These are not just for binding items. You can use them to create slingshots or even keep items tightly packed together.

By understanding the survival uses of common household items, you can better equip yourself to handle various emergencies. Always remember to stay calm, think critically, and use your creativity to improvise with what you have. The next time you look around your home, you may see a treasure trove of survival tools ready to assist you in any situation.

Creative Ways to Repurpose Household Items for Emergencies
----------------------------------------------------------

In times of emergency, knowing how to utilize everyday household items can make a significant difference. You can turn what might seem like ordinary objects into valuable tools for survival. Here are some creative ways to repurpose common household items that could come in handy in an emergency situation.

### Water Filters

Having clean water is crucial during emergencies. One clever method to filter water is using clean fabric, such as a t-shirt, as a filter. Here’s how:

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/what-are-the-most-useful-survival-uses-for-common-household-items/  
  
- **Gather your materials:** You'll need a container, clean fabric, and a rubber band.
- **Fill the container:** Use the fabric to cover the opening of a jar or bottle and secure it with the rubber band.
- **Pour water through:** The water will travel through the fabric, filtering out sediments and larger particles.

This method won't purify water entirely, but it can help make it more potable until you find a way to boil or chemically treat it.

### Cooking Without Power

If the power goes out but you still need to cook, you can use other household items effectively:

- **Camp Stove:** If you have a camping stove, it can be a lifesaver. Always keep fuel stocked!
- **Charcoal Grill:** Use your outdoor grill by lighting it with charcoal. Just ensure it's in a well-ventilated area.
- **Fire Pit:** If you have a fire pit, you can cook meals over an open flame using skewers or grill grates.

These options allow you to create hot meals even in a crisis, ensuring you stay nourished.

### Improvised Lighting

When the lights go out, you’ll need a way to see in the dark. Here are some quick methods to create your lighting:

- **Jars of Candles:** Place a candle inside a jar to create a lantern effect. The glass will protect the flame while magnifying the light.
- **Flashlights:** If you have a flashlight, check that you possess extra batteries. Old toys can house small LED lights too.
- **Oil Lamps:** If you have cooking oil, you can create an oil lamp. Fill a small dish with oil, add a cotton wick, and light it.

Improvised lighting options can not only help you see but also set a comforting atmosphere during chaotic times.

### First Aid from the Kitchen

In emergencies, minor injuries may occur. Fortunately, your kitchen items can serve as first aid supplies. Here’s a helpful list:

- **Honey:** This natural sweetener has antimicrobial properties and can help heal minor cuts.
- **Olive Oil:** Great for soothing dry skin, it's also beneficial as a massage oil for muscle pain.
- **Saltwater Rinse:** Mix salt with warm water to create a mouth rinse for sore gums and throat.

These household staples can provide relief and aid in recovery for various injuries.

### Emergency Shelter

While you may think a tent is necessary for shelter, simple items can serve a similar purpose:

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/what-are-the-most-useful-survival-uses-for-common-household-items/  
  
- **Old Sheets or Blankets:** Use these to create makeshift tents by draping them over furniture.
- **Tarps:** If you have a tarp, this can be set up in your backyard or a nearby area for immediate shelter.
- **Boxes:** Stacked boxes can help create walls for your shelter, providing extra insulation from the elements.

This creative use of common items can keep you dry and protected if you find yourself outdoors without a proper tent.

Knowing how to creatively repurpose household items can empower you during emergencies. By implementing these strategies, you'll have valuable resources at your fingertips when you most need them. Being prepared and adaptable can make all the difference.

### Conclusion

When unexpected situations arise, knowing how to repurpose common household items can be a game changer. From using plastic bottles as water filters to transforming old towels into bandages, the potential for survival is right at your fingertips. These creative uses for everyday objects can make a significant difference in emergencies, allowing you to respond effectively and resourcefully.

Understanding the versatility of household items expands your toolkit, enabling you to adapt to various challenges without needing specialized gear. For instance, kitchen utensils can serve as makeshift tools or signaling devices, while duct tape can mend materials or hold together broken items in a pinch. These strategies not only help you sustain yourself during crises but also encourage a mindset of innovation and resilience.

As you explore these survival techniques, take the time to familiarize yourself with the items in your home. Practice repurposing them now, so when it counts, you’re ready to act quickly. It’s about being resourceful, thinking outside the box, and treating your surroundings as a rich source of potential solutions.

By recognizing the survival capabilities of everyday items, you empower yourself to face emergencies with confidence. Whether you're preparing for a natural disaster or simply aiming to enhance your self-sufficiency, these insights can turn ordinary objects into extraordinary lifelines. So, the next time you look around your home, remember that even the most mundane items can hold the key to your survival.

Cartier launches the Santos-Dumont XL Hand-Wind manual winding movement watch (size: 46.6\*33.9mm)! Watches & Wonders launched a more atmospheric and more suitable Santos-Dumont XL Hand-Wind manual winding movement plus watch in 2020, with an innovative shape and proportion! What's more surprising is that this timepiece is equipped with a Caliber430 workshop-made hand-winding movement! F1 Factory bought this watch for the first time to make a deep 1:1 replica! 

Movement/exclusively customized Asian version 430MC hand-winding mechanical movement, with a full power reserve of 36 hours. Although this model is a closed bottom design, F1 Factory does not make it shoddy to reduce costs! The main plate of the movement is engraved with the Cartier double C logo in the same way as the original, and the appearance is 90% similar to the original Caliber430MC movement! Leather strap + buckle. 

The new model is upgraded to a leather-wrapped titanium head based on the old one, making the strap tighter and more durable, and the ergonomic design makes the whole watch more comfortable to the hand! The F1 factory invested heavily in mold casting, and the hole position and the card shell position are integrally formed. With the quick-release spring ears, it can be easily assembled and disassembled! 

The leather materials are imported from Italy with pressed crocodile-grain calfskin (navy blue, agate black, elephant gray, coffee) and American crocodile leather (navy blue, agate black) to choose from! The F1 factory only uses A-grade belly bamboo-grain crocodile leather, which is by no means comparable to ordinary tail leather and scraps on the market. Of course, the price is a bit expensive! The bottom lining uses the same lining as the card home, which is comfortable to wear! It is equipped with the iconic pin buckle that is molded according to the original 1:1, which complements each other! Produced by f1, actual shots of shipment

I´m on the 8th floor and have an amzaing view of a prestigious golf club -that I'm not part of- but, neither me (24M) nor my parents (56M) and (52F) use it. Not at all! Still, they make me clean it every week under the excuse that they always want to go out and 'enjoy' it but cannot because it happens to be dirty. My mother says I should clean it even more frequently: every other day. For context, I live in a desert mountainous coastal city so the balcony acumulates dust and sand. How frequently you ask? Every other day. Yes. 

I'm getting to the bee murder part.

The description of the 'Interstellar' apocalyptic environment is rather the normal lifestyle for me. Wind blows. Picks up humidity from the sea. Mixes it up with sand from the mountains and sticks it like concrete right in the floor of my balcony

...so I clean.

And every time I do I notice sometimes one, others two dead bees. Thereof one and a half bees. If it would be any other insect, I wouldn't shed a tear or give it a thought. Depending on the species, it might even make me glad. At most, it would bother me the fact that I would have to sweep them up -plus dried bird shit- before mopping the terrace. It would be some unpleasant extra work. But no. It is bees. They are cute, yellow and cute because of their color. Furthermore, I happen to know from general knowledge, that they are endangered species (Bee Movie, 2001). 

All added up: It hurts. Bad.

But I have not explained how they die yet. I will. The balcony is made of glass. It's transparent. And like many, if not all, insects can't see it. So they fly into the balcony and then try to fly out and I guess they hit the glass 'railing' (not sure if that's the right word. English is my second language) And these retards just don't to fly up so they exhaust themselves flying full force, helplessly, into the glass wall. Now; I say I guess because, I never actually see them die, I see them dead: full of dust, contracted and dry. On some rare cases I see them still fighting for dear life so I help them escape. One unfortunate time, I grabbed one and dropped it from the balcony to it's freedom. 

Oh how wrong I was. 

The little guy must have been so tired and dehydrated from flying towards a wall for hours, that it didn't took flight, at least until I lost sight of it around the 5th floor.

I try to comfort myself with the fact that, since this entire city was built on a desert, those bees exist thanks to people in the first place. Why? Well because there would be no vegetation nor water to live from. So existing and ceasing to by your maker doesn't sound so bad and even quite poetic -now that I think about it. But it still bothers me. You might say: ""It's just 2 bees a week, no big deal. 

No it isn't. 

My building is 18 stories tall, 16 of whom have a terrace. there are two apartments per floor. That is 32 balconies. Assuimg each kills one and one half bees every week. That is 48 bees a week, 2496 bees a year! 

It gets even worse.

I moved in in 2019. I believe the building was built in 2017. Best case scenario, in 2018. We are nearing the end of 2024. It's been 7 years. My building has killed 17472. According to google, that's the size of a bee colony. Madness. This is mass murder. This is genocide. But, at least unlike Bee Movie 2001, my building don't steal all the hive's hard earned honey.

I'm devastated.

My building has strict rules. I can't just replace the glass railing for another bee friendly/visible material. Once, my american floor-neigbours placed their towels to dry in the balcony and the karens in the building made a scandal through the WhatsApp chat of the building's landlords. They are tenants  so they hopefully didn't read the class slurs they were ranting. They were asked not to do it again indirectly through the concierge. Poor neighboors. They were kind law-abiding fellows. It's because of this aesthetic-related rules that I can't touch the balcony to save the bees.

On the other hand, I have to 'bee' honest (haha). I hate cleaning the balcony more than the death of those bees. It's hard to accpets but it doesn't hurt enough for me to do anything about it, yet I clean that damn balcony every week. My unemployed ass owes it to my parents. What did hurt was when a bee stung me when I was a kid. I cried. So maybe, this is karma for the bees. Sins of the father, sins of the son.

I have told only one person about this. 

My younger sibling (19M) who studies abroad in the US, so he could review my spelling since his english is better. As of today I don't plan on telling anyone else. Anyways, there might be enough information here for a geoguesser type of guy to deduce my identity from the details I've given. I'm posting it on reddit thanks to the anonymity of this social network. I'm not sure I would ever dare to talk to someone IRL about something so random. That is what I'm trying to find out. If I would, how could a normal conversation naturally degenerate enough for it to justify me introducing this 5 year old anecdote? I belief to remember that once, a topic's conversation reminded me about this bee predicament and I sought to mention it but stopped myself in time. Is it normal to have such thoughts? 

Am I retarded? 

Will people think I'm retarded if I confide in them? To add insult to injury, many people I know already feel that way about me. The question then would be: Would the disclosure of such thought harden such judgement? These questions I wish be answered by strangers. Specifically by redditors. The weird stuff I read in here makes me feel like you guys are as weird as me and that somehow I won't get abused in the comments below. Are some of these stories even real?

I think some are not. 

But some have such espicificity that convince me in spite of their insanity. For the record, this one is. I have been as honest as I can be articulate in english. The ages of people mentioned are true, the genders, the time frames and specially the number of dead bees. 

If it's not believable, I take the blame. 

I hardly do myself, but I had to get that itch from the back of my head. Maybe this way the thought will stop coming up every time I have to mop that useless balcony/terrace. When I move out, God willing, it won't be to place with one; unless it's 2m^2 tops. Enough to put two chairs and a tiny round coffee table. That's for another time because I don't have the money for a place of my own, I'm still single and I don't even drink coffee.

May your judgement come with mercy. 

PS: It would be fun to see someone deduce the country I'm from just from these thoughts. Please don't hack me. I promise to admit if someone guesses the right answer and it's substantiated correctly. Lucky guess don't count.

1h9zzzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h9zzzc/am_i_developing_feelings_for_my_girl_bestfriend/,Am I developing feelings for my girl bestfriend again?,"22M. Have been friends with this girl for 4 years, close friends for around 2 years. We met in college by being in the same friend group. We became really close very quickly during sophomore year after having a few classes together. We began to talk & text a bunch, study together, spend a lot of time together just us two (watching movies, grabbing coffees, getting lunch, etc.), and we'd often go off on our own at parties & dance together. She instantly became one of my best friends but I developed feelings for her as I found her super pretty and found out how cool of a girl she was. She was subtly flirty with me and progressively got more touchy. She told me how I'm the only guy she's comfortable around. The lines became a bit blurred for me as to whether we were just friends or if something more was going on. But I didn't want to risk ruining our friendship. It wasn't until I found out her own friends thought I should ask her out, so I built up the courage to ask her if she ever saw us as more than friends, to which she said no. It honestly shocked me, as I thought she for sure felt the same way, but it also hurt because I was worried I just ruined our friendship.

Fast forward, things were a bit weird for a while but we got over it. Now, we both graduated last spring but she's doing an extra year while I'm back home working, so we don't see each other often. But, we are definitely close friends again, we ft each other every now and then to catch up and she doesn't live far from me luckily, so when she is home we can see each other. Anyways, so I'm super happy we're close again as I really do value our friendship. I haven't thought about her as more than a friend in over a year. But, we met up over thanksgiving break to spend a day together, which was so much fun. It made me realize how much I missed her. And she kept telling me how she'll be home again in a few weeks for winter break so we have to meet up at least a few days over break. So I knew she really missed me too. My dilemma now is that after meeting up, I now find myself questioning again what it'd be like if we dated and if she'd ever develop romantic feelings for me. But I don't have a crush or anything on her again. I honestly think it might just be that I missed her so much and just wish we could spend more time together (which dating would be the easiest to do so). I'm not really sure what I'm feeling, if I maybe do have some romantic feelings for her again or if I just really missed my good friend?",1,1733713003.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I was on cloud 9. What an incredible morning. This game that lives rent-free in my head, that has crushed my soul thousands of times, and now I have two orbs! Fantastic! ...also, I still had most of the day, so, why not keep playing? Time for some victory lap style decisions though. Back to Coglin Hunters (it's what I know) but let's screw around with Xom or Lug or something...

After a few quick deaths, I found a D:7 Temple with Xom and I got on board the chaos train. I was expecting a difficult game, and I had some close calls, but when Xom yanked me into a Bazaar mid Orc:2 and sold me these two absolute beauties, I knew it was going to be a blast. Punk, the weapon that carried me on my first win, but now with chaos? Oh, sure, Xom was going to end up getting me killed, but it was going to be glorious on the way down.

    Bought the chaotic +3 greatsling ""Punk"" {chaos, acid, rCorr} for 406 gold pieces

    Bought the +7 hand cannon ""Pukheb"" {chaos, rElec rN+} for 773 gold pieces

Back in my first CoHu win, I trained Evocation up to 24.6... and then I never used an Evocable. This play through I wanted to put that exp. Into something fun, so I dumped it right into Necro. Sure, moving around friendlies is obnoxious as a hunter, but they also eat enemy fire, and they spawn way over where they died... far away from me. Animate Dead, Death Channel, and Fugue of the Fallen while raining acid and chaos? Even when Xom ripped me across the map into the loot area of Elf:3, my tide of undead elves was inevitable!  Could it get any better?

    Snake:2 Acquired the +7 hand cannon of Massacring {speed, rC+}

Popped an Acq scroll and got the drop I never get. Dual-wielding Speed and Chaos all the while trying to survive Xom and build my hoard of undeath... what a great victory lap indeed! 

By the time Xom took me out of Zot:2 and threw me into the third level of the Abyss I didn't even care anymore. The Abyss couldn't deal out the pure chaos that I was. I got out, grabbed the orb, and ran for it. My 3rd ever win. With Xom. While screwing around celebrating finally winning. Even got a gem.

If you look for videos there are 2 different versions one with a Straw and one with a bag. 

**Straw Version:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckj7tFVrM0c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckj7tFVrM0c)

**Bag Version:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kjMj8Zh5vg&t=37s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kjMj8Zh5vg&t=37s)

Are there other version? Maybe, 

So the Lactose Liquid is the version I had, I poured in an 8 ounce glass and drank it.  It really had almost no taste to it.  I had no symptoms from drinking it, I didn't expect to have any anyway.  My issue is constant belching causes from something some foods are worse than other, even Low FODMAP foods didn't seem to reduce it, I did the diet for 7 weeks, lost like 15 lbs on it.  

The worst part of the test is the anxiety, from prepping for it, not taking any GERD medications, 14 days, the caffeine withdrawal from the 1 day fast, what a headache that brought on.  I don't drink coffee, cause it makes me feel like shit, even-though black was allowed, I didn't drink any.

I hope I did it right, I wish the bottles had a click, to know when you tightened it enough.  Over-tightening is bad they say. 

Other then that the test was pretty smooth, the 2 hours go by pretty fast since every 15 minutes you have to do something. 

I don't know why I'm hoping for a positive result, but I am, I just want to be able to solve this issue, belching like 20-30 times after certain meals suck.  With my luck UPS will lose the package. 

If I had to rate this test from 0 being easy to 10 being hard, if you remove the 14 day prep, it's a 0.  With the Prep, depending on your gerd conditions I can see it being a 10. ",1,1733712369.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

1h9zr6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h9zr6o/korean_german/,Korean German,"I met you in April 2024 through Tinder. You super-liked me on March 18, and I was thrilled—you’re Korean, and I’ve always been fond of anything Korean. You messaged me shortly before I traveled to my hometown, asking where I usually play tennis. I didn’t respond right away because I was busy, and your question made me think you were only interested in tennis. I ignored it until March 24, when you sent another message. This time, I replied. You asked if I was up for a game, and we agreed to meet in mid-April when I returned to Manila. You mentioned you were a bad texter (so am I), so we didn’t keep in touch much before meeting.

Fast forward to April 16—we played tennis at VMMC. I picked you up at MRT Quezon Avenue station, and you were my first non-family passenger since I started driving in Manila. I was so nervous because you didn’t talk much, leaving me to carry most of the conversation. I also didn’t expect you to speak English so well—I thought communication might be a challenge. On the court, I played terribly because I hadn’t practiced in over a month and wasn’t used to hard courts. I was so embarrassed. Afterward, we went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant near your place, Feta. I liked how you took the lead in choosing the restaurant and ordering food—it was a relief since I’m bad at making food-related decisions.

During lunch, we talked about your nice condo, your ex-girlfriend who moved abroad, and your upcoming trip to Germany to celebrate your birthday with friends. I felt the date didn’t go well—the mismatch in tennis skills and the awkwardness during lunch left me intimidated. You paid for lunch, and I dropped you off at your condo. You gave me a side hug before leaving, which felt like a good sign. Still, I thought it was a one-time thing and that I wouldn’t hear from you again.

In June, I saw you at VMMC tennis courts, wearing the same purple shirt from our first meeting. I pretended not to recognize you. Then, on July 11, you messaged me, asking if I was playing in the weekend tournament. The conversation was brief but ended with you suggesting we play again sometime. On July 24, out of the blue, you messaged, “Hope you’re fine during this typhoon season. Depressing weather.” It was so random, but it made me happy. Still, I guarded my heart, not sure if you were really interested.

On August 5, you asked if I was playing in a tournament at CSA Bulacan on September 7. I initially said no—I was tired of doubles due to partner issues—but you encouraged me to try singles. I agreed, partly to spend the day with you. I figured you might need a ride since CSA is far, and we planned to go together.

September 7 marked our second meeting, five months after April. We ended up spending the entire day together because my games were in the morning and yours in the afternoon. I picked you up at 6 a.m., and we headed to the venue. Playing singles, a game I’m not confident in, was nerve-wracking because I wanted to impress you. Despite my poor performance, we grew closer that day, supporting each other throughout the tournament. You met some of my friends, which felt special. On the drive back, we talked a lot, thanks to the heavy traffic. We had dinner at Hyeongje Grill, a Korean BBQ place near your condo. For the first time, we sat next to each other—it felt like a boyfriend-girlfriend moment as we cut meat for each other. Before parting, you gave me another side hug. This time, it felt more meaningful because you returned to the car just to say goodbye. I knew there’d be a next time, but I didn’t want to rush it.

Our next meeting was at UP Diliman for tennis. You met some of my friends, though you were very introverted and not as social. Later, we had lunch at Din Tai Fung in Megamall, where you introduced me to my now-favorite dessert, Golden Lava Salted Egg Buns. We had coffee at Muji, where I learned your go-to order is iced Americano. At the elevator in Shangri-la Mall, you gave me your usual side hug before leaving.

When you injured your wrist, you weren’t sure if you could play tennis. I hesitated but asked if we could do lunch instead. You took a day to respond, which made me anxious, but eventually, we planned to meet on October 20. For the first time, we met without tennis involved. After meeting at Zara, we had lunch at Grifoni in Podium, followed by coffee at Elephant Grounds. I was still very conscious around you, but I enjoyed our time together. When I left, you said, “See you in December when I’m back from Thailand.” It was the first time you expressed wanting to see me again, and it meant a lot.

November was filled with thoughts of you. I couldn’t get you out of my head and counted the days until December. Then, as I prepared for a friend’s wedding, John Mayer’s XO played, and it made me think of you. Hours later, you messaged me. It wasn’t much, but knowing you reached out meant the world to me.

I don’t know what will happen next, but I want to keep seeing you and getting to know you. Writing this on my flight back to Manila from Iloilo, I just can’t get you out of my mind.",4,1733712198.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Im in kind of a tough situation and im not really sure what to do. My brother and sister in law live in boston so one morning while im visiting boston i was supposed meet up with them for coffee but i just found out a close family relative is staying with them. And this close relative used to be very inapropriate with me when i was little. He would baby sit me and my earliest childhood memories are all of him and what he did to me but i never told anyone because he made my feel like i wanted it and it was all my fault and even though logically i know its not but i feel like it is my fault because i remember instances where i willingly went into his room. So i always felt that if i told anyone they would say its my fault and my parents love him and he would tell me they would chose him over me. And my parents have been through so much and i never wanted to burden them with this so i stayed quiet. It stopped when i was like 12 but i still have night mares and i when someone touches like my lower back or butt or thighs i feel like im gonna vomit. But hes gonna be in boston and hes coming to the breakfast thing and i dont know what to do cause my dad wants me to see my bother cause their relationship is rocky and i dont wanna mess it up but i cant tell them to not bring him with out it being suspicious you know. And i feel like a terrible daughter because i love my parents and i dont want to cause problems but theres also a small part of me that hates them becuase they never noticed! How could they never notice? I would have panick attacks when ever he came over for holidays like balling on the floor uncontrollably and they just thought i was being difficult and i felt like them words to tell them where stuck in my throat and suffocating me. There were years where i wouldnt let people touch me at all and they never saw that something was wrong and im so sorry to put this all on you but im really panicking and ive never told anyone this before like ever not in a diary not ever and i just need someone to hear the words that have choked me for 15 years",1,1733712187.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

I'm not used to reddit or community stuff I'm 31 male. I hope this post might help somebody. I hope this post might help guide some soul and tell him/her that is not alone. That there are more people that are dealing with you issue

  
I've been following Dr K since the Pandemic in 2021. It was like fresh air in the worst part of my life and because I watched him I had expectations on my medic. When I got into medication I asked my shrink (psychiatrist I love the word shrink because one english teacher used it in an english class and I never forgot it I always wanted to use it in a sentence) for advice and he told me that he's here for the pills if I want some self improvement I should go to a psychologist.

I work at HR (Human Resources or Inhumane Resources as we joke) as a crew manager for two cruises (small ones) but it was like doing a lot of papers for like 160 people. The red flag that now I know that was there was that the person that was working in my position wanted out because of burnout and lack of mobility in the corporate ladder.  I went to the gold rush of wall street bets and loose big money for my reality. I went into debt with the bank. Having a huge debt and working in a company in which I could be fired got me into fear mode and God knows how much did I try to do my best to keep my work but the more I wanted that the more conflict that was generated.

  
During the pandemic the company fired a lot of people. One of that was the former CEO. He was a guy that started in the company with a internship and made his way up. People usually said that he was a hermetic person and that he never wanted to teach people how to work, but in the few months that we where working he taught me some basic stuff. For what I know he was the person at the company he knew all the ins and outs. He was what I wanted to become. He was a tree that was starting to shelter me in the work. Unfortunately he did not want to cut his salary during the pandemic and the company fired him. They paid him and he went his way. 

The new person in charge was with the company for a long time. But he didn't know how to do the job. The former CEO did all the heavy lifting and nobody else knew all the company in the same way as he did. The hard times for the company where starting.

I that started to work in the company in January 2020 was now the go to ask person. I managed the people and because when the coworkers where cozy at home during the pandemic taking it easy I was reading all the info that I could get into. I read all the manuals that the former CEO made for the company and I got into studying the maritime laws in my country (totally not Chile) that were changing at the time.

For what I've leaned from my inner work I was doing all that because I was afraid and scared. But also because I wanted to invigorate my ego. Me me me. I can do all this at the company and because I can do all this you can not fire me. I'm afraid of being let go so give me more work to do. I'm afraid of being lonely so I can't say no to other coworkers requests. I can do everything so I don't need help or as my inner smart kid sayid I should be able to do all. I never failed a subject. Never. I always went to extra curricular activities and we won. I knew no defeat. I. the same I that Dr K yells with energy on the videos of ego was in charge. And because that if it wasn't my way it was wrong. All the advices that people tried to give where on deaf ears. I was like a raging bull. Some people tried to help but in that state of mind those were no advice those were punches launched at me. I was in a fight mode. And because nobody knew what to do (because the former CEO did all the heavy lifting) all the people in the company were in similar mode. I think that the people were thinking something like if the ship is going to sink it's not because of me.

The head of HR was a lady that new nothing of the maritime industry and she was the last person that was fired during pandemic. I always remember a worker that said to her. You are going to be the last one fired and that happened. She tried tho. She always went home late. She always was in the office and she was the last one there. Looking back I relate that she might have been afraid. Then the new head of the company put other persona as head of HR. They asked the team (me and the person that pays the payroll) to teach him the ins and outs of HR. We did, but he didn't liste. We told him to prepare with time but he did not. He used to work for other company of the holding an now he was head of HR for our company too. He was used to other kind of life. He was the person that was always in the kitchen drinking coffee or he was talking with coworkers. Now he needed to work, take decisions and file reports. It's not as he changed that much but the team had to work around that.

Looking back during that time form me was like being in the bridge of a ship in a stormy day. The engine of the ship is not working. You try to contact the personnel for help but they are putting out the fire. You are an officer and there is no captain for help he's out of the picture. You are alone in the bridge. Other ships are pointing their guns at you. The sea is moving and all the lights are red and red doesn't mean good. The alarms are ringing and you have to make a choice. You jump the ship to try to save yourself but you drown, but when you drown you apear all again in the same situation. There was no escape I was sinking myself deep into the sea. To the unknown. It was my firs failure.

For context during a day I started to work at 8 AM (the entry time was 9 AM) an worked all day until 10 pm (exit time was 6:30 pm). I always was behind in work. One of the worst recurring issues was that I was hiring a person, that person was sited next to me while I was working his documentation While I was sending an e-mail to a coworker that needed data, while I was talking on the phone to the next hire I needed, while a coworker was talking me to send him/her information that was urgent. Hell I was like an octopus. A person told me during this time something that translate like this. You might not be able to finish your workload, but your workload might finish you. During this time I needed to do stuff fast, and because of that I usually fought with coworkers (usually higher ups in the food chain) to do stuff faster. That's why I hate meetings, you are in a room with people trying to come up to a solution that you came up half an hour ago and because they don't know what to do they want you to explain to them step by step why they should do that and they take their time (and yours too) time that you need to do operative stuff. It was frustrating. It was here the point when I went numb. I was a working and fighting machine, I needed to do my job. For all the people there that might be in a similar situation, that might lack the capacity to tune with your own emotions and you feel like you are in a dark place. All I have to say is that you could be able to overcome that. But as Dr K says it's going to be a hell of a ride. Sometimes you might go back to that dark place and then see the light. It's like drowning yourself and then taking a bit of air, just enough not to drown but you still drowning. What can I say. You'll drown many times. More than I would like to admit. But each breath you take is becoming larger and larger. The liquid that you are fighting with it's becoming way less denser and when you think you are good again you'll drown again. Hell some crocodile tears are running on my face. But now you know you can save yourself and the cycle continues. But with time each cycle is not as hard as the previous one. Now you are back in the bridge of your ship and the lights are not red, the lights are not green not yet, the lights are yellow. The other ships are not pointing at you, they are just ships in the same sea as you. You might discover that you might need the assistance of a captain but there is other possibility, that because you have more experience and knowledge you might have become your own captain.   

In school, high school, college and even in a masters degree program the people teach you how to succeed. But they never tell you what to do when things go south. It was my first huge set back and it was very personal. My ego was damaged, my mind was in shambles. Learning to deal with failure for me was hard. I was not used to failure. I'm still working on that.

Dr K was like a star that helped me guide my ship. But a guide serves one purpose, to choose by yourself your destination. You are the person that has to choose where is your new destination. 

What did the best improvements for my situation? 

First you have to ask for help, you might like it or not, but the truth is that you are in no position of taking a decision. You have to ask for a professional. You might need medicine. You might have been in a position in which you were like a frog that was in a pan with cold water but the chef decided to turn the stove on and bit by bit the water starts to heat. You might tolerate it, but you might not now the real difference between warm an boiling. Maybe you just are used to boiling and you forgot what does cold feel like. Maybe your body is telling you that you are boiling but you don't listen.

Second you have to move your body, you have to exercise. Your body has to be able to keep with your mind and if your mind is exhausted it's better for your body to be exhausted as well (why I don't know but it did work). For me a rowing machine worked and I only do three sets of 15 minutes per week. Also i do stretching in the morning.

Third having more muscle helps you during the day now you can help yourself. Cleaning my room and my house has helped me a lot. But when I stoped doing exercises I stoped doing all the related stuff.

Fourth having an emotions diary helps to get to know you better. It does help to identify what does triggers certain reactions. For example thanks to this I realized that when I was near a coworker I was starting to feel bad emotions. My stomach started to grow. My spine started to curb. It was like Golum from Lord of the Rings.

Fifth keep the people important for you together and look for excuses to interact with them. I pushed away my friends because of the workload that I had. Because if I wanted to hang out with them it was usually late. And it's weird how after laughing until 3 am I can wake up with energy at 7 am on Saturday and be productive in house stuff. If you can not interact with them face to face maybe a vodeogame might help with some voice chat. There is a fulfillment in knowing that you matter to another person.

Sixth the way is long and you should look for your own mantras for difficult times. I used to over eat (and some times I still do but not as bad as before). My mantra was something that translates like this. A morning without eating for fun is a day I won. Then it became a morning and a evening, then a day. Now I say it to myself when I want to over eat and I'm starting to loose weight.

Seventh you are going to loose some days, but you can also try next day. And when that happens I say to myself It's ok to loose today but I have to win tomorrow. But I have to put emphasis that I say it as a friend to myself. With a smile as a anime character (maybe Naruto)

  
Eight you have to learn from yourself, you write down your own manual and when you learn from yourself you start to pick up somethings that you never even considered. For example some people say that I don't look at people that I glare at people (mirada penetrante in Spanish). Some people had said that I'm very intuitive with people that I'm starting to know. But now I realize that I glare because I was bullied as a kid. I have to be intuitive to because I have to know if the persona approaching me has good or bad intention. It's sad in a way but not many people can do that. It's kinda like a super power. And with that information now I have to learn to get my guard down and relax.

  
You never stop learning

  
I hope this helps you

Have a good morning/evening/night/day/year/decade/life :)

I'd find a girl to date and she wouldn't be 'the one' (odds are you won't marry your first partner), I'd build up confidence through college and have some hook ups in college and through my 20s. I'd move to a big city where there's stuff to do and I could play rec soccer. Around age 28 I'd seriously start looking for love. I'd try a couple jobs and figure out what I wanted to do, I'd take some trips. 

Well, none of that has happened. I'm 30, I've gone on nine dates and my first and only kiss was nine years ago. No, I never went further than that quick kiss on the lips. I have no relationship experience and very little idea what I want in a partner. I never gained any confidence and have no clue how to flirt. In general I still feel completely unwanted, undesirable, and at best invisible to women. I feel like having done none of those goals I had, that I wasted college and my twenty's and effectively my youth. Yeah, I know 30 is still young, but other than having a job I don't feel any different than I did when I was 20. 

I haven't been able to get over my anxiety and there is no way I can approach a woman in person. Dating apps destroyed in less than a month what confidence I had that took nearly three years to build up in therapy. My depression is still here and I don't feel like medications have helped at all. I still feel like I'm broken, I'm unwanted, I'm an outcast, and obviously I have no self esteem or confidence in myself. 

I know there's so much more to life than sex, but it's damn near the only thing I think about sometimes. There are teens who weren't alive when I was in high school that are having sex. Then I'm over here having a panic attack lasting for hours when trying to decide which coffee shop to ask a girl to meet me at. 

Therapy and everything else I've done hasn't made me feel like I have any chance to stop feeling like shit or that I'll find a girl who likes me. Online dating is terrible, I used a half dozen apps for nearly a year and I had nine on my phone at one point; I used tinder, hinge, and bumble for about 15 months, and from all of that I got maybe 50 matches and two dates out of it. I know a lot of people agree online dating sucks, but holy fuck that makes you feel unwanted and rejected by women. If I did get to a date, I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know how to really act on a date, I can't flirt, I struggle to pick up on body language, and I'm not charismatic. I'm weird and awkward and who tf wants to go home with the weird guy? Let's say she was okay with me going for a kiss, I think I'm more likely to vomit from the nerves than try to kiss her. 

In summary, I feel like I've wasted more than a decade of my life and that after years of trying to work through autism, social anxiety, and depression and seeing no progress, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm unhappy with myself, I'm sexually frustrated and touch starved, and I have no goals or direction in life. I feel like a complete failure in so many areas of life.

Near the beginning of my sophomore year of college, on my 20th birthday, my girlfriend of 3 years and I ended our toxic relationship due to me discovering that she had been cheating on me.

And then, just two months later, I started dating a girl that I thought I would be with forever. 

The college we went to was a little weird. We would go to a state sponsored community college for 2 years and earn our associates degree, and then we’d be able to move up to our main campus which was a major University that was also in the same state. If we did this program (2 years at the community college and 2 years at the university), then the state would cover most of our tuition.


Needless to say; just after my 20th birthday in October 2021 when my long term girlfriend and I broke up, it was rough living at home and commuting to a community college. More than anything I just wanted to fully immerse myself in the college lifestyle and forget about her, but that lifestyle didn’t exist outside of our “main campus”. I was living at home and driving to school just like I always had, it was a rough time.

But all that changed when I met this girl. We were in a history class together and really hit it off talking after class, she was so cool and funny to talk to, it was the most fun I’d had meeting someone new in such a long time. And she was so unbelievably beautiful, you wouldn’t believe it. The fact that she’d be seen talking to a guy like me was insane to me. I eventually got her number and we started texting a lot. When the semester was coming to and end we started going on study dates to local coffee shops so we could prepare for our finals. These study dates eventually turned into real dates and I was loving every second I spent with her. She officially became my girlfriend shortly after Christmas in 2021.

She was so perfect and everything about our relationship was wonderful, better than anything I could have ever imagined for myself. We went to the city together to go on romantic dates, and could spend cold winter nights just driving around and having deep conversations about life. We painted together a lot (one of her hobbies), and cuddled up at night to watch our horror shows together. We went to the mall together, we went to fancy restaurants together, we took cold walks on the beach together. I spent all my time at her house, which was in the same town as our community college and was also the capital of our state. 

For the first time in my life, and after two failed relationships before, I felt like I was truly in love. And I could tell that she was in love with me back. We made a pact to be with each other forever, we called each other our soul mates and we would talk all the time about what our future would look like. She was so nice to me and respected me like no one else ever had. And I loved her more than anything else in the world.

When the spring semester of my sophomore year started, we signed up for a lot of classes together and hung out together all the time. I was also able to score an internship with the state government, which was absolutely perfect because I have always been obsessed with politics and government, it was my major in college and more than anything I want to hold elected office some day and do my best to change things for the better. The office was also 5 minutes from her house and 10 minutes from our campus, so I was in this town all the time. I was over the moon. I had my dream job, my future career prospects seemed great, I was with the love of my life and only falling deeper in love every day, and I was acing all my classes.

Also around this time I decided to take up Shakespearean stage acting, I auditioned for and was cast in a Shakespeare show at a local theater in my home town, which was huge for me because I had never put myself out there like that.

June 2022 eventually came around and my girlfriend and I graduated from community college with our associates degrees. My internship came to a close, and I performed in my play, which sold out every night and went amazingly. Also around this time my girlfriend and I made plans to continue our studies at our university’s main campus. She would be moving into a dorm and I would be moving into a townhouse with my best friends from high school who were already up there. They were about 10 minutes apart.

I spent the summer of 2022 managing the campaign for a state senator who I had met through my internship with the state government. It was a grueling job that took up most of my time and he ended up losing, but he paid me well and I got a lot of valuable experience, definitely saw the hard side of politics that I would have to undertake if it was something I wanted to do.

As my junior year started, my girlfriend and I moved up to our main campus and our relationship grew even stronger. We were no longer living with our families so aside from when we were in class and when she was at work, we spend almost all of our time together going on dates or having sleepovers or just hanging out at each others places. It was so perfect and we felt like we were preparing for our marriage life when we would live together. Every day I kept falling deeper and deeper in love with this girl. We had such a profound connection and we knew everything about each other and were completely vulnerable together all the time. I was certain I had found my soul mate.

It was also so great getting to live with my friends and have people over to our house all the time. Every night if I wasn’t with my girlfriend, me and my friends were all partying at my place after hitting the bars.

On top of this I had always been pretty good at school and had saved a lot of money up, so life was going pretty well for me, I was the happiest I’d ever been in my life.

I even started in another Shakespeare play in spring of 2023, and began to earn some serious props as an actor.

In the summer of 2023, after my junior year,I was offered an internship with my dad’s company as a salesman.His company is a massive manufacturer in the restaurant industry and I would be charged with selling to end users. I did pretty well with it, ended up closing about 200k in business. This caught the attention of an affiliate company (a broker firm that worked closely with my dad’s company) and they offered me a full time job when I graduated with extremely generous pay. Obviously I accepted.

My senior year was essentially a repeat of my junior year. I starred in another Shakespeare production, I was living with my friends acing all my classes, I was with my girlfriend all the time.

But in a way it was even better. I had the security of a job offer after college and my girlfriend took a one year lease on a townhouse that was right next to mine, so I got to see her even more often.

Everything continued to be so perfect, until I graduated college with my bachelors degree. 

My girlfriend’s lease ended about a month before mine, so she moved back home immediately. I planned to do the same once my lease was up as I thought it would make more sense to work full time and save up for a house rather than renting. 

She changed pretty much immediately after we graduated.

We were a very normal couple, we enjoyed a healthy sex life and occasionally going to the bar together. We made crude jokes and laughed a lot about stupid shit, and we did a lot of stupid shit together.

She spent the last month of our relationship falling deeper and deeper and deeper into a religious rabbit hole until she was essentially a fundamentalist evangelical Christian. She had always been somewhat more religious than me, but not like this.

For context, I’m not a religious person at all.

The last month of our relationship consisted of one ongoing fight. I needed to convert and throw myself as deeply into religion as her and make Jesus the center of our relationship, or we would be done. I tried and tried and tried to compromise with her but ultimately I couldn’t lie about the person I was to appease someone else. We broken up mutually at the end of June, on our 2 and a half year anniversary.

I was completely devastated. But I didn’t have time to heal. I had started working full time just two weeks prior, and two weeks after our breakup I moved back home with family.

I was numb. I was upset about leaving college and moving out of the house I shared with my friends, but most of all I was completely fucking broken over the fact that the relationship I thought would last forever had ended. All I did was work, I threw myself into my job and started working constantly.

And I discovered that I don’t like my job.

I cover the entire metro area of the major city that I live 45 minutes away from. I have accounts all over here and I’m expected to be calling on them all day or doing admin work. It’s a lot of driving, a lot of sales, and a lot of soulless boring fucking work that I don’t enjoy doing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely lucky. I couldn’t get paid this much bag my age anywhere else and I’m very grateful for that. But I don’t want to do sales; I don’t like it. I like government and politics, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do since I was 12.

I have some friends living in my hometown, and I see them as much as I can, but it’s hard to do much more than play video games together or go to a bar together for a few hours at a time when most of us are all working full time.

Furthermore, the girl I thought I would marry started seeing someone else (a youth pastor) right around my 23rd birthday. She meant everything to me and I was fucking replaced in 4 months.


I’m empty. Most days I go to work and come home and don’t do shit. I’ve started working out and I was cast to be in another play, but it’s not helping. I see my friends when I can, but it doesn’t help. I feel completely stuck.


It’s been 5 and a half months of dealing with this new reality. I have lost all hope and optimism I have for the future. I also had a falling out with all of my female friends, so the only people I talk to are my few close friends, my family, and my coworkers. And I only ever even see my coworkers like once every two weeks, I’m alone at work most of the time.

I truly don’t know where to go from here. I know I want to move out of this town as soon as possible, but it feels like all the happiness I once had was gone.

I’ve been aware of POTS for over a decade, but didn’t really know what it was until I started researching some symptoms I’ve experienced over the past few years. They’ve gotten worse the last year or two. My heart rate can get up to 150 after getting out of bed. It always goes up after standing. I feel dizzy, winded, foggy, and like I have anxiety for no reason. And I generally just feel extremely fatigued on a daily basis. I’ve had to quit drinking coffee because of the increased heart rate and anxiety. I haven’t been diagnosed, but I’m at the point I think I should talk to a doctor about my symptoms. I work in a high stress career field, and I feel like I may have to find something else that’s not as stressful. 

After a diagnosis, what has helped the most between medications and other lifestyle changes? I understand increased fluids and electrolytes, especially salt, is helpful.",1,1733711623.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

1h9zjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CotUPCC/comments/1h9zjrs/milk/,Milk,"Milk has always been a staple in my life, but I never thought it would play a role in my journey towards enlightenment. It started with a simple realization: the act of pouring milk into my morning coffee became a moment of mindfulness. Each day, as I watched the white liquid swirl and blend with the dark coffee, I felt a sense of peace and calm. This small act, seemingly mundane, was my first step towards appreciating the present moment and embracing mindfulness.

As I delved deeper into the practice of mindfulness, I began to see milk as a symbol of purity and simplicity. Its white, unassuming nature reminded me of the importance of stripping away the complexities of life and returning to a more basic, authentic state of being. This symbolism became a powerful reminder to focus on the essentials, to nourish not only my body but also my mind and soul with simplicity and clarity.

Milk also taught me about the interconnectedness of all things. From the cow that produces it to the farmers who collect it and the process it undergoes before reaching my table, I began to see how everything is interconnected. This realization expanded my understanding of the world and my place in it. It made me more conscious of the choices I make and the impact they have on the environment and others. It was a humbling experience that fostered a sense of gratitude and responsibility.

Another aspect of milk that resonated with me was its nurturing quality. Just as milk is one of the first sources of nourishment for many, I began to see the importance of nurturing myself and others. This realization encouraged me to cultivate kindness and compassion, both towards myself and those around me. It was a gentle reminder that, just as milk provides sustenance, my actions and words can provide support and comfort to others.

The routine of having milk daily also became a lesson in consistency and discipline. Every morning, preparing my coffee with milk became a ritual that grounded me. This simple act of consistency reminded me that enlightenment is not a sudden epiphany but a gradual process that requires daily practice and commitment. It taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of nurturing good habits that contribute to my well-being and growth.

Milk's transformative nature, as it changes from liquid to foam or mixes with other ingredients to create something new, became a metaphor for personal transformation. It inspired me to embrace change and be open to new experiences. Just as milk can take on different forms and flavors, I realized that I, too, could evolve and adapt. This perspective helped me to let go of fear and embrace the unknown, knowing that change is a natural and necessary part of life's journey.

The simplicity of milk also helped me appreciate the beauty in everyday things. Often, we get caught up in the search for extraordinary experiences, overlooking the simple joys that life offers. Milk, in its plainness, reminded me to find beauty in the ordinary. This shift in perspective allowed me to see the world with fresh eyes and appreciate the little moments that make life meaningful.

Another lesson milk taught me was about balance. Whether it's in my diet or in life, balance is essential. The presence of milk in my meals became a reminder to maintain balance in all aspects of life—between work and rest, solitude and socializing, giving and receiving. This balance is crucial for maintaining harmony and well-being, and recognizing it was an important step in my journey towards enlightenment.

Sharing milk with others, whether in the form of a cup of tea or a meal, became an act of connection and community. It reminded me of the importance of sharing and being part of something larger than myself. This sense of community and connection is a vital aspect of the human experience and a key component of enlightenment. It taught me that we are all interconnected and that true happiness comes from connecting with others and contributing to their well-being.

In conclusion, milk, in its simplicity and purity, became a powerful symbol and tool on my path to enlightenment. It taught me valuable lessons about mindfulness, simplicity, interconnectedness, nurturing, consistency, transformation, appreciation, balance, and community. What started as a simple ingredient in my daily routine evolved into a profound source of inspiration and insight. Through milk, I learned to see the world differently, appreciate the little things, and embrace the journey towards a more enlightened and fulfilling life.",1,1733711528.0,CotUPCC,0,1.0,False

I am 5’1”, plus sized, and experience anxiety (especially in relationships). I have little dating experience, so please be patient! My love language is words of affirmation. I understand physical attraction is necessary, so I’m open to swapping pics sooner than later. I am looking for a serious relationship, so if you’re only looking for nsfw chat, I’m not for you.

🎵🎷 I graduated with my music ed degree, play saxophone and sing!

☕️🍣 I love sushi, chain restaurants, and coffee. My go-to order is an iced vanilla dirty chai latte.

🍿📺 I like watching movies (thrillers/romcoms) and the same tv shows over and over (dance moms, glee, good girls, etc.) 

👩🏻‍💻🩵 I work full time for a small business in inventory and fulfillment.

About you:
* Preferably between 23-30 years old and in the area (within reason)
* Masculine leaning or male. I tend to go for mountain men (tall, muscular/bulky build and beard), but I’m open to all figures and ethnicities :) 
* Kind, patient and a good communicator
* Please have your own form of transportation

I’ve learned we can’t go anywhere without everyone being fed first, then potty breaks, and no stops along the way from home to the event/destination or the little one yells at us and demands we go straight there because there is zero patience with that kid.  It also can’t be too crowded of an event because they will get bored and boredom equals mad, so we can’t just stroll along and look at things or enjoy the atmosphere because the older one gets social anxiety and the little one storms off and demanded do what they want to do (which is usually whatever kid activity is there and nothing else).  We made the mistake of going to a carved pumpkin walkthrough display that ends with a bounce house kingdom.  Well, they put the bounce houses in front so you see those first but you can’t get to them until the end.  So the whole time the kid was crying about how they wanted to “have fun” and wouldn’t do anything else along the path.

Today we decided to go to an old fashioned Christmas market.  We had to stop 3 times on the way to find a bathroom, by the time we got there we realized it was so packed we weren’t going to be able to move in there so we chose to go somewhere else.  The change of plans was difficult at first but we got through it.  We went to a nearby town to walk their small shops and cafes.  We told the kids that we were looking for gifts for family and that this wasn’t about getting stuff for ourselves, it was about giving to others.  Well, apparently we didn’t say it literally enough because the little one found a toy in the first shop that they were in love with and wouldn’t leave it alone.  When we finally moved onto the next shop, they wouldn’t let the idea go.  It festered into an obsession and before we knew it, the kid was mad and crying and refusing to do anything unless we bought that toy.  We tried explaining that Xmas is coming and this isn’t a time for us to buy things for them, but to shop for others.  This smart kid says “but you said we’re shopping for family and I’m family!  I’m part of your family, so you should buy it for me!”  We had to leave the store and sat outside in front for a good 20 minutes with them sobbing and throwing a fit because they couldn’t move on from this toy.  Finally I just gave up.  I walked away saying “I’m going to get an ice cream cone”, went across the street and came back with 1 single cone in my hand and just stood there not saying a word, hoping it would be enough of a distraction to shift this kid’s attention and make them want that instead so we could calm down and talk about the situation.  I assumed there was a low blood sugar thing happening as well because they refused to eat the sandwich we ordered earlier because the peanut butter tasted different from ours at home.

So, once we all went back over and got ice cream and could move on from the toy obsession a little bit, we weren’t able to go in any other stores because we were afraid the kid would find something else they wanted and freak out all over again.  We walked up and down the town, stopped in 1 store to get coffee and 1 to get a box of chocolates as a gift.  But other than that, the entire day was blown over a stupid toy in the first store!  

I just don’t know how to handle this anymore.  Our oldest used to love going to stuff like this when they were little.  But the last couple times it’s been the youngest causing a big stink over things and making the whole experience miserable.  My therapist suggested we get a sitter and do these things without the kids, but it just doesn’t feel right to do that. These are typical holiday things that we consider family traditions and we only have so many weekends during the holiday season to enjoy these things.  I never thought they would be so hard!

Can any of you relate or offer advice on how to keep our family outings alive without a guaranteed meltdown?

My daughter turned 2 yesterday.

The last month she’s gone through what feels like a personality change.

She fights every nap, not only is she fighting it she acts mental in her bed.
Not crying but like just yelling NO NO No and turning over jumping and being crazy but if I don’t let her nap she’s feral she defiantly still needs her nap.

Then she can’t put her self to sleep anymore.
She was always able to self settle from 6-7 months of age.
Now she screeeeama for mumma or baba (dad) when we put her down and we have to sit with her.

-

When she doesn’t want something lie us to clean her face, change her, tell us no or grab something she says “is mine” to put away even if she isn’t using it she will absolutely go mental.
Like head back, scream!! Not an ahhh scream but she will have an angry scream yelling what she wants.

She’s very smart, talks like. 4 year old. Everyone who meets her says both things.

1- woah she’s sooo smart and clever because you can have conversations with her .

(she’s also super interactive like she loves pretending to play doctors, tea and coffee with her toys hide and seek ect)

2- she’s a fire cracker.

- when she’s angry it’s game over. It’s sooo hard not to get frustrated and snap.

- she ends her tantrums fast they’re not meltdowns because she knows what she wants, they are not for no reason but she has a lot of them and she’s super bossy.

-
She has no fear!! Lately her new thing is to step of the slide instead of sitting on her bum or tummy.
And she falls on her face and tries to do it again.
Like wtf?

I get worried because I don’t remember my nieces or nephews having extremee temper tantrums.
I also don’t remember them being so fearless.

I wonder if it’s signs of adhd or if she might be high on the spectrum.


When she’s mad her voice is the loudest ever, I think my neibours can hear her yelling/screaming.
They must thing I’m torturing her.

The head back thing also worried me that she will hit on something hard one day.


Are some toddlers just crazier than others?

She gets away with things sometimes being a toddler but I don’t want her being those 4 year olds that scream down a shopping centre when they don’t get there way.

I don’t give into her either, but that doesn’t teach her.

She’s not behind in anything at all and is so smart so I don’t know if she’s on the spectrum but her emotions are so whack that I really question it.

She honestly starts giggling after a tantrum after she gets her way sometimes (not always but sometimes I just need too for sanity)

2- she’s a fire cracker.

- when she’s angry it’s game over. It’s sooo hard not to get frustrated and snap.

- she ends her tantrums fast they’re not meltdowns because she knows what she wants, they are not for no reason but she has a lot of them and she’s super bossy.

-
She has no fear!! Lately her new thing is to step of the slide instead of sitting on her bum or tummy.
And she falls on her face and tries to do it again.
Like wtf?

I get worried because I don’t remember my nieces or nephews having extremee temper tantrums.
I also don’t remember them being so fearless.

I wonder if it’s signs of adhd or if she might be high on the spectrum.


When she’s mad her voice is the loudest ever, I think my neibours can hear her yelling/screaming.
They must thing I’m torturing her.

The head back thing also worried me that she will hit on something hard one day.


Are some toddlers just crazier than others?

She gets away with things sometimes being a toddler but I don’t want her being those 4 year olds that scream down a shopping centre when they don’t get there way.

I don’t give into her either, but that doesn’t teach her.

She’s not behind in anything at all and is so smart so I don’t know if she’s on the spectrum but her emotions are so whack that I really question it.

She honestly starts giggling after a tantrum after she gets her way sometimes (not always but sometimes I just need too for sanity)
It’s like how did you go from 0-100 in anger to laughing one second later?

Can anyone make me feel seen 😞😅 ",2,1733710739.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

1h9z8y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1h9z8y7/nobody_believes_that_i_was_kidnapped_by_fairies/,Nobody believes that I was kidnapped by fairies on Christmas Eve.,"It was always the same words, the same slightly upturned lips like they were trying not to smile. I always expected that response, but not so passively, like dragging a blunt knife down my spine. 

Nobody believed me. 

A year since I was kidnapped by fairies and left behind while my friends were taken away, and I was slowly losing my mind between giving into my own delusions and gaslighting myself into believing I’d had some kind of psychotic break and none of it was real. 

Dr. Casey was my latest in the long line of psychologists assigned to me since my so-called mental breakdown. 

Sitting in front of me, her smile was patient and her eyes were trying to be sincere. I liked her office. It was a lot cosier than the others. The one in Boston had walls that made me feel like I was in a psych ward. Sickly green, resembling barf, with too-bright lights and a TV in the waiting room that only played ancient game shows with zero volume. 

Dr. Casey’s office was minimalist with a desk and a bookshelf. The decor was warm, purplish blue, an outdated laptop sitting in front of her. Unlike my other therapists, she seemed… human. 

While the others had clinical white offices and scary looking posters on the wall bearing mental health disorders and human trafficking warnings, Dr Casey had stained coffee mugs and ancient comic books piled on top of each other, a dogeared map sitting on top.

She chewed on her pen between writing, tapping her feet to a beat only she could hear. 

Which was familiar and relatable. 

My therapist was a beautiful woman, kind, brown flecked eyes and velvet coloured hair tied into an untidy ponytail. When she leaned forward and met my gaze, I found myself taken aback by her natural beauty.

She smelled of fresh pine and lemon, and had a smile that wanted to help. 

Dr. Casey made me feel comfortable. 

I thought I could tell her everything. 

So, I started talking. 

Hesitantly at first, but the more I was speaking and actually letting everything out, all of this fear and frustration and anger I had been bottling up for a whole year.

Initially, she seemed interested when I told her the basics, nodding and making comments to assure me she was listening. 

I started telling my story as normally as possible. My flight was cancelled on Christmas Eve, and because of my age I had no choice but to join my fellow young travellers inside the unaccompanied minors lounge. 

Dr. Casey kept smiling and scribbling in her notebook until I got into the meat of my trauma. Why I couldn't fully look her in the eye, and even a year later, I still struggled to sit still.

My hands were always wandering, either delving into my lap or playing with stray thread on my jeans, my fingers steepling together, constantly  clammy. I could never fully suck air into my lungs during a therapy session. 

I had an odd posture, leaned over myself, my lungs crushed. 

There was never enough air for me to breathe, and my body was constantly too light, like at any moment I would lose contact with the ground all together.

This kind of thing was better to explain by saying, “I had a psychotic break” but I thought I could talk to someone who would listen. Who wouldn't call me crazy. 

I always felt small and childish, hating the words coming from my mouth. 

Eighteen years old, and I still felt so much younger. “I was kidnapped,” I told her, a lump growing in my throat. 

Dr. Casey’s smile faded, eyes darkening. 

I noticed her fingers tighten around the pen. She began to write before pausing, her gaze snapping to me. “Kidnapped?”

I could already see the cogs in her head turning, ready to make phone calls and offer support– maybe even call the police. It's not like I didn't look like a kidnapping victim. 

I was sickly pale from malnourishment, my hair hung in tangled streaks in front of my face, and I hadn't bathed in days. 

But my failure to meet basic hygiene was for a completely different reason. I didn't know how to tell her I couldn't wash or brush my hair, and I couldn't force food down my throat. They wouldn't let me. 

When I spoke of them, she leaned forward with wide, sympathetic eyes that were going to listen, urging me to take my time. 

She thought they were human, an abusive family member or significant other. That was until I dropped my gaze, shuffling uncomfortably on my chair. 

It had been the same leather chair for three weeks, and I still couldn't get comfortable. 

The upholstery felt wrong grazing the backs of my jeans and I had been nervously picking on it since starting my session. I had been skating around the subject of my depressive episodes. 

Because when I eventually let loose and went into detail, I always lost them. I lost my therapists with one single word. 

“Kidnapped,” I said again, “By fairies.”

Dr. Casey stopped writing, her lip twitching slightly. She lifted her head. 

“You were kidnapped by fairies,” her brow shot into her hairline. 

Dr. Casey’s expression crumpled into what might have been sympathy before confusion and amusement took over. 

Before I could respond, she cleared her throat a little too harshly, and spoke the words my last five therapists had said with the exact tone. “Miss Jaimison, aren't you a little old to still believe in fairies?” 

Yes, I was. 

I didn't even believe in them when I was a little kid, and now I was being hunted by them. In the space of a year, fairies, and to an extent, Santa Clause were real. 

Dr. Casey sighed when I didn't reply.  “Okay then, Ruby,” she continued to scribble in her notebook, and I wondered if she was making a note to send me for an MRI. 

Her smile was still polite, though a little strained. Just like the others. 

“Why don't you talk me through what happened?” 

I started to, but she cut me off. “Miss Jaimison, there is nothing wrong with disguising your mental trauma with preferred fantasy. It's common with young people.”

Fantasy? 

Was she fucking serious?

I knew the difference between reality and fantasy. 

For the last several months, both had blurred into each other, enveloping me completely. To other people, fantasy was what they saw on TV or read in books. 

The fae folk, beings of light and beauty hiding amongst the flowers. 

Which was the fantasy I grew up with. 

That fantasy, however, had been haunting me since I escaped my fate to become an heir of the kingdom. 

It existed in the tricks that woke me up at night, open windows when I was sure I'd shut them, and poison ivy between my sheets, my possessions being whisked away. That was a warning.

When I refused to submit, they bled inside my brain and made me question my own reality. I coughed up my own blood and teeth, lost clumps of my hair.

They wouldn't let me shower, or brush my hair, or eat. 

They were constantly there, whispering and giggling in my ear, murmuring nursery rhymes in their language, their songs all entangled with my lost friends' names. These little bastards tugged on my hair when nobody was watching, a symphony of childish giggles entwined in my skull. 

“It's not… fantasy,” I spoke coolly and calmly, but in the corner of my eye, I could see sharp flickers of movement. “It's real,” I whispered. “I was taken to a different world where fairies exist.” 

She nodded, continuing to write. “Okay, and would you say you were awake during this, uh… this venture? You said you were falling asleep in an airport terminal, correct?” Dr. Casey nodded at me with a smile. “Do you think maybe you experienced a vivid fever dream?” 

“No.” I swatted at my own face again. I could hear giggles. They were laughing at me. “No, I was definitely awake,” I spoke through gritted teeth. “I wasn't alone either. There was a group of kids with me, and there were these screens that…” 

I caught hold of myself. “I know it sounds crazy, but,” I struggled with my hands, stuffing them into my lap. “These screens… the ones in the room they took us to. They hypnotised kids into thinking they didn't have parents.” 

“Mmm hmm.” Dr. Casey lifted her gaze. “So, are we talking, like, mind control?”

I nodded. “Yes. There was this Christmas themed animation playing, and it put my friend into a weird trance.” I felt my own secondhand embarrassment, resisting the urge to rake my nails down my face. 

“It made him think he was an orphan. Just like everyone else. I saw it too, and I can't explain it.” my hands were wandering again, this time streaking through filthy strands of my hair. 

I could feel them tugging my scalp. It was an endless tug of war with them. 

Still though, thinking back to their influence on me, that for a single moment with my eyes captured by their magic, my mind drowned by their light and lullabies, I thought I was an orphan myself. 

It was so vivid. I had been suffocated with false memories of an orphanage I never attended; wooden bunk beds and children that were not real. 

These things had planted fake thoughts, fake feelings and memories inside my brain, enchanting me and luring me in, before I had snapped out of it with the help of Levi and Thalia. 

I didn't realise I was choking all of that out, words tangling from my lips, my voice splintering, until I was handed a tissue, and I swiped at my eyes. 

I didn't mean to say any of that out loud, but saying their names, or at least revisiting the memories I had tried to suppress, was a surprising weight off my chest. 

Dr. Casey continued writing. She was scribbling way too much to just be making notes. “Okay, and who was this friend?” she looked up at me, lips quirked into a smile. She wasn't laughing at me. 

This was a sympathy smile. She thought I was fucking crazy. 

I tried to lean across the desk to see what she was writing, but she easily hid her notebook from my prying eyes. 

“Was he an, um, a ‘fairy person’ too?”

“Jude Whitlock,” I whispered. 

His name didn't feel real or right on my tongue, almost like he didn't exist anymore. 

“No. He was a human, and they took him along with the others.” 

I played with the thread on my jeans. 

“He was the worst affected. I think because he, uh, he already felt detached from his parents. So, it wasn't hard for them to wipe them from his memory.” 

I straightened up in my seat. “Jude didn't have a good relationship with his Mom.”

Dr. Casey cocked a brow. “Oh?” 

“Yeah.  He said he only got to spend time with her two days a year.”

She paused writing, tapping her pen. “And you haven't seen him since?”

I shook my head. “No. The last time I saw him, he was completely under their control.”

“Their… fairy mind control?” Dr. Casey cleared her throat. Something flickered in her expression. I saw her write separation followed by a question mark. “And did you say the other kids…” she flicked back through the pages of her notebook. 

“Levi and Thalia. Were they taken too?”

Nodding, I squeezed my eyes shut. “Yes. But they were replaced by fake versions. I think they're called changelings, though there are also these things called Strays. Who are human kids turned fae that the Kingdom gives back.”

“Uh-huh.” she chewed on her pen. “So, to go over, your human friends were kidnapped by fairies and replaced with…” she nodded at her notebook, “replicas of them, that are called Strays.”

I shook my head. “No, the Strays are different. They're not wanted, and given back to the human world. They're previously kidnapped kids no longer wanted.”

She met my gaze. “And have you met a Stray?”

I did. 

When I was saved by the kind fae who brought me back, there were two Strays in the car.

I still remembered their battered and bruised faces, skeletal figures and haunted eyes. I remembered the markings on the boy's head from his crown, his flesh shredded and burned, sliced and ripped apart. 

The slits in the girl's back, where a semblance of wings may have been before being cruelly sliced away. I never saw them again. 

There were hunters on earth who specifically went for Stray kids. I was told they were  worth millions to humans. “I did,” I admitted. “But they ran away before I could talk to them.”

“Ahh, of course. They ran away.” 

I stuffed my fists in my lap, trying to breathe. “You think I'm crazy.” 

Dr. Casey dropped her pen with a sigh, her gaze flicking to me. “Well, at least you're self aware. Honestly, this all sounds a little far fetched. I am not supposed to be harsh with my patients, but you are an exceptional case.” she inclined her head. 

“Ruby, how exactly did you get it into your head that you're being hunted by fairies? This world,” she glanced at her notebook. “All of these  things. Your friends being kidnapped and uh… half fairy kids spirited away, child eating plants, magical doorways and stray kids being hunted down. It’s not really real, is it?” 

Here we go.

“Ruby, the world is boring. And I don't blame you for creating this world inside your head.""

Dr. Casey offered me another sympathetic smile. 

“You are an intelligent young woman and you don't seem to be suffering from either neurological trauma or PTSD.” she tapped her manicure on the edge of her desk, rechecking over her notes. 

“Do you think you may have an overactive imagination? These friends you talk about.” I watched her fingers drum a single beat. 

“Levi, Jude, and Thalia. Are they perhaps people you strayed away from?""

Dr. Casey talked with her hands a lot. “It's possible that you have created a fantasy of sorts, to cope with losing their company.” she leaned back, her smile a lot more patient and understanding than all of the others. 

But she still didn't believe me. 

I think those words were what broke me. Not telling me I was too old to believe in fairies, or implying I had psychosis. She was telling me friends I lost were not real.

Just delusions of my mind. And if they were real, they were past friendships I was dwelling on and clinging onto.

Something splintered inside me. “I can't breathe,” I managed to grit out. “I feel like I've lost half of my breath since coming back, and sometimes I can't suck in air,” my voice broke. “It feels like I'm suffocating.” 

My therapist cocked her head. “That sounds a lot like asthma, Ruby.” she leaned forward. “Do you think maybe you're suffering from panic attacks?”

“They're not panic attacks!” I surprised myself with a yell. “They stole my breath!”

“Who stole your breath?” 

“The fairies!” I swallowed my words, clawing out my hair, pulling it from a particularly violent tugging match between two sets of tiny hands. “I mean fae... I think they're…referred to as fae?”

“Yes, I believe that is what they are called.” 

Her deadpan tone was starting to get under my skin. 

“Can't you see them?” I hissed out, holding out a strand of my hair. “They're right here!”

Dr. Casey’s mouth hung open, like she was struggling to coerce words. Before she could speak though, her gaze snapped to behind me, her expression twisting. “Liam, this is a private session!” 

I twisted around in my chair, meeting eyes with a boy who was my age. 

Hiding behind a bed of dark blonde curls, his eyes were wide with terror, parted lips moving like he was trying to speak, but failing. 

His gaze was frenzied, almost feral. It only took a single glance where intricate lines of ink danced across his forehead, like a child had been using his face as a canvas, for me to know what he was. 

Dr.  Casey was blind to the state of him, and he knew I'd noticed it, quickly yanking the hood of his sweater over his head. “Shut the door! I'm with a patient. I'll be with you in a moment.” 

The boy shot me a look, like he was trying to speak, before nodding and stumbling back into the waiting room, quietly shutting the door behind him. 

“Please excuse Liam, he's one of my patients. He doesn't know the meaning of privacy.” My therapist turned back to me, her expression relaxing. “Have you spoken to your parents about any of this? Do they offer their support?”

“No.”

I didn't mean to raise my voice, but I felt like I was being ripped apart inside. 

Parents were a sore subject. 

Just because I escaped the kingdom didn't mean I wasn't replaced too. 

There was a girl with my face living with my Mom and Dad. A girl with too-pale skin, a playfulness in eyes full of mischief.

I watched her meet my father at the airport. Ever since then, my life had been on a downward spiral. I choked up bloodstained flowers daily. I lost my teeth. There were vines growing at the back of my throat, markings I couldn't explain on my legs and arms. Like I had already been branded as theirs. 

Marked for the hunt. 

“I’m not crazy,” I whispered, trying to ignore my hair being yanked and pulled from side to side by tiny fingers. 

“I’ve lost my parents to a thing that looks exactly like me,” I hissed out. “I've lost half of my breath. There is a constant chokehold around my neck squeezing breath from my lungs. They're slowly killing me.” 

When I jumped up, Dr. Casey flinched slightly, like I was going to attack her.

“I'm constantly light on my feet,” I continued. “I feel like I'm floating. Like I'm never really touching the floor.”

Sinking back into my chair, I couldn't resist a sob. “They send me… warnings.” 

Dr. Casey hummed. “Warnings? Okay, and do you have them here with you?”

I thought back to the confused look on my Boston therapist’s face when I tried to hand her an old piece of parchment I'd found glued to my window with the remnants of my roommate's cat. 

The parchment was an invite into the kingdom and to accept my crown as an adopted heir to the court. 

The calligraphy was always graceful, beautiful, scrawled in human blood. 

I dropped my gaze, losing all my bravado. 

“It's…it's invisible to adults.”

Risking a glance, I could see the muscles in my therapist’s face twitching. Casey’s lip curled. I was losing her. “These warnings that are haunting you are… invisible to adults?” 

She cleared her throat. “Okay, so your kidnapped friends have been replaced by fairy replicas, and you are being haunted by a fairy kingdom, but their warnings are completely invisible to adults.”

I thought back to Liam. “And what they do to you,” I added. The markings and brandings. It's all invisible to adults.”

I could tell Dr. Casey was losing her patience. Still though, I was surprised she held out this long. The Boston therapist gave up at the start. “Miss Jaimison, you are eighteen years old which is classified as an adult.” I jumped when she dropped her pen on her desk. “Go home, Ruby.”

The woman nodded at me to stand up, and I did, grabbing my bag. “I don't think we need to continue this conversation.” 

Before I could protest, her phone rang, and she picked it up. 

“Yes,” My therapist lowered her voice, gesturing for me to shoo like I was a rabid raccoon. “Uh huh. Yes. Perfect condition. Yeah, I'm in the possession of…” she trailed off, meeting my gaze. 

“It.”

Dr Casey cleared her throat, irritation pricking in her eyes. “Ruby, I believe we are finished talking. Have a nice evening.” she went back to her phone. “Yes, I've got it with me. Mmm. Yeah, like I'd said, zero scratches or marks.”

When she collapsed into hissed whispers, I strode towards the door, only for something to catch my eye. On her bookshelf were tiny wooden fairies bearing wide smiles and intricate wings.

These things looked cute and playful. They looked nothing like the beings that kidnapped my friends. I couldn't resist turning around, my gut twisting. 

“Do you collect those things?”

Dr. Casey turned to me, her phone still glued to her ear. “Sorry, what was that?”

I pointed to the figures. “Those fairies. Do you collect them?”

Her gaze flitted to the figures, lips curving into a smile. “You could say that,” she pointed to her phone. “I'm actually in the middle of selling them right now, so if you wouldn't mind…” 

Before I could answer, I was already being escorted out of her office, the door slamming in my face. In the waiting room, the boy from earlier was sitting cross legged on a plastic chair. 

My heart leapt into my throat. I knew it wasn't him, but the way he was sitting, tense, dark eyes following me across the waiting room, like a caged animal, he reminded me of Jude, bearing the same scowl and eyes that did not trust easily.

Jude was a private school kid I'd met in the airport, a boy who didn't want anything to do with me until our plane was cancelled. When we were taken into the kids lounge, I lost him, his mind already captured by the hypnotising screens. Jude mentioned a lost sister.

Which made me wonder if there was more to him than I'd thought. 

The last thing I said to him was reminding him he had a mother and a sister. But he had been far too gone to hear me, enveloped in their fairy dust. 

Unlike Jude, who previously had a destination, his parents house, this kid looked tragically lost. He purposely bowed his head to hide himself, but I already knew who and what he was. 

I could see exactly where his disgraced crown had sat on top of thick blonde curls. 

“You're a Stray.” I said, folding my arms. 

“Go away.” He shied away from me, shuffling back like a wild animal. The boy pressed his head into his lap. “They already know your name,” he sniffled.

His voice was rough. I could hear the turmoil and torture he had gone through. I wondered how long Liam had been inside the kingdom. From the way he was acting, he must have been young. “You can't run from them.”

A shiver skittered down my spine. “How did you escape?”

Liam looked up, his lips splitting into a grotesque smile of razor sharp teeth. 

“I was replaced.”

I nodded slowly, swatting at a tiny ball of golden light hovering in front of my eyes. Liam’s gaze followed its manic dance, his eyes narrowing. “My friends were taken,” I said, “Is there any chance they could be given back?”

Liam cocked his head. “Do they have your friends' names?”

I thought back to the list of naughty and nice. 

Yes. They had their full names. 

“Yes,” I said in a hiss of breath. “But–” 

“Liam?” Dr. Casey’s door flew open, her head poking out. I tried to ignore the boy flinching, the way his body seemed to lurch back. “Would you like to come in?” her gaze snapped to me. 

“Ruby. Go home please.”

I glanced at Liam, who looked panicked. 

“Do you… want to go in there?” I asked him. 

“Liam.” Dr. Casey’s tone hardened. “Come on, what did we talk about? I told you I’m going to help you, remember?”

He nodded with a quiet, “Yes” before ducking his head and following her into the office. When the door clicked shut behind them, I thought back to the miniature fairies sitting on her bookshelf. 

I hovered outside the door for a few more minutes, before swiftly leaving. I was on my way down the stairs to the reception area, when two men shoved past me on their way up. 

Dr. Casey told me to go home, so I did.

That night I woke up coughing up blood stained flowers, vines stuck between my teeth and blossoming at the back of my throat. They weren't just haunting me mentally, they were playing with my body. 

There was something there, twisted and sandwiched, stuffed down my throat. 

Standing in front of a mirror with tweezers, I forced the two blades into the back of my mouth, pinching a single vine. 

When I pulled it from my lips, my throat ruptured and I choked up blood tinged petals, leaves, and a growing tendril of earth entangled with a single strand of hair. Thalia. Her long red hair stuck in my memory, and now it was clogging my faucet and shower drain.

Thalia’s hair was the first real warning that they were coming. 

Quickly followed by a shred of Levi’s hoodie.

And then, Jude's private school sweater. 

It was always pieces of them, nothing was ever whole. All I got were torn remnants and fragments of what had been real. It felt like a tease, like they were dangling my friends in front of me. Cutting them apart, piece by piece. 

Until nothing remained. 

I grew sicker. Paler. Pulling scarlet streaked flowers from my lips and coughing up clumps of Thalia’s hair became a daily occurrence. I was barely conscious in class when the air around me suddenly stilled, a streak of shivers spiderwebbing down my bones. 

I could barely concentrate on the class itself, beforehand, white noise screaming in my ears. Now it was too silent. 

Like all the sound had been sucked into a vacuum. Even the sounds of light typing, brief conversations and pages flipping over. Everything had come to an eerie stop. Lifting my head, it wasn't just the sound. Movement had come to halt too. 

My professor stood at the front of the class. He was frozen, glued to the spot. 

But his eyes were still moving, frantically snapping left and right.

Around me, my classmates were paralysed to their seats. 

The ponytailed blonde next to me was mid-drinking her water. She was frozen, while water sloshed down her throat. 

I could sense that she was choking, her cheeks turning red and then purple. But she couldn't move. The sound of water filling her gut, her stomach expanding, sent my own catapulting into my throat. 

It took me a disorienting moment to realise the wave that had enveloped my class had taken me too. Glued to my chair, I caught a flash of movement in the corner of my eye. There was a shadow moving down the aisle, a figure drowned in light so bright I couldn't see a face. 

When a sharp breath sounded next to me, and the girl with the water dropped to the ground, I thought it was just her. 

But when it came again, another hiss of breath, and then another, students collapsing like dominoes, I knew exactly what was happening. It was pulling their breath from their lungs, teasing it, before tearing it from their lips. 

Bodies continued to drop around me. I could sense it, almost see it, wisps of dancing white being dragged from parted lips and disappearing into nothing. 

The lights flickered above me. 

I saw feet moving toward me, dancing down the steps. 

Closer. 

Under dull light, I glimpsed the torn remnants of a navy blue sweater clinging to a skeletal figure. The closer he came to me, I felt my own breath leave my lungs and squirm its up my throat, forced through my lips. But it didn't leave me.

Not yet.

When he stopped in front of me, the lingering students around me toppling off of their chairs, he teased my breath, once, and then twice, holding it between my frozen lips, letting me slowly suffocate. 

When my professor dropped, the lights brightened. The figure was no longer a shadow, a being that was once human. It still bared a human face, remnants of its old self. I wasn't sure what to call him. Beautiful, or maybe horrifying. 

I couldn't tear my gaze from his skin, flesh that had been battered and burned, branded and used as a canvas. 

There were intricate lines of black dancing his cheeks, just like Liam. But while Liam’s had been old, faded, his were wet and fresh. I could still see the gleam, imagine the dripping paintbrush. 

There was so much wrong with him. Malnourished cheeks and skin so pale and brittle, like the pages of a book. 

And yet I still found a sick sense of beauty, that grotesque and breathtaking beauty I remembered from their world. 

I had nightmares of him being twisted and contorted into one of them. But it was real. I had aged since our kidnapping. 

A whole year had gone by. Jude, however, was still frozen at sixteen years old. 

Dark brown curls adorned with flowers and thorns, a crown of bone sitting on top of his head. I could see sharp pieces of bone sliced into his flesh, old and new rivers or red streaking down his face. 

His lips carved into a feral smile that greeted me. 

No longer human and forever sixteen years old, I still recognised him. Jude suited his crown. 

He suited his smile, too-pointy teeth and eyes filled with mischief. 

Jude never had human parents, or at least ones that cared about him. Maybe that was why he had accepted his fate. 

Accepted his crown.

After all, what 16 year old human boy wouldn't want to be the heir to a fairy court? 

What he didn't suit, was the bruises and burns, his body twisted into a plaything for the Kingdom. Jude looked both human and fae, twin slits in his back, flaps of flesh resembling their sick idea of wings. I waited for him to take my breath. 

He did, tearing it to and from my lips like I was his own personal toy. 

When he was bored, Jude reached out his hand, finally, his eyes lighting up. 

I pretended not to see the scalding marks covering his arms. 

The rugged flesh on the backs of his hands. 

“Ruuuuuuuuby.”

From the look on his face, and the whispered giggles in my ear, him laughing with the fireflies buzzing around me tugging on my hair, I didn't have a choice. He made that clear when he violently ripped breaths from my lungs, one by one. I accepted his hand when I could move again, gulping in oxygen. 

Jude didn't speak to me. But he did speak to the things still clinging to my hair, giggling in their tongue twisting language. We left the room, his claw-like fingernails digging into my skin. 

He told me my classmates were not harmed.

However, they were missing a significant chunk of their breath. 

“Your sister,” I managed to get out, when he pulled me through the dark. I didn't even notice the passage of time. He could have had my breath for hours. 

Something rancid crept up my throat, and I spat out another explosion of red. 

More of Thalia’s hair stuck to my lips, glued to my chin. 

“Did you find her?”

He surprised me with an inhuman grin that was not his, a glitter in his eyes that was both insanity and glee. 

Jude had their exact mannerisms, their twitching smiles and gleeful eyes. He was a bigger version of the fireflies trying to rip my hair from my scalp, laughing along with them. “What sister?”

I was wrong.

I thought Jude still had lingering humanity. 

But he was completely gone. 

I knew where he was taking me. Jude took me back to the nightmare world that I had been told multiple times wasn't real. The world filled with child-eating plants, and the wooden cage filled with human children that I had escaped. 

I didn't feel as light back in their world. 

I felt like I could breathe again, my bare feet grazing the floor. I wasn't expecting the reception Jude got when he dragged me through streets threaded with plants and vines, beings with painfully beautiful faces and horrifying twisted and contorted bodies dropped to their knees in front of him. 

The ground became harder to tread through, vines and flowers with minds of their own twisting around my ankles. Jude pulled me through them, laughing. 

Quickly, it turned to bones we were wading through. 

Humans. 

These things didn't just forcefully adopt  people. 

They murdered them, proudly brandishing their horrified looking faces. 

Stumbling after Jude, I scanned each kill. 

Levi and Thalia. They couldn't be here, right? 

Looking back, I think part of me wished they were. The palace was not what I was expecting; a building made purely of human bone and entangled vines, a towering structure standing over the court.

The guards standing in front of the doors bowed when Jude stepped through the door. While the exterior of the palace was exactly what I was expecting inside a fae court, the interior surprised me. 

I could tell the fae stole not just children, but human possessions. 

Glittering chandeliers hung from the ceiling, a staircase made purely of rose quartz.

The ground was made up of patchwork human flooring, carpet and marble with pieces of plastic, woven with thick greenery. In front of me loomed two thrones made up of entangled vine, the King and Queen, adorned in the remnants of children, blood and bone decorating them.

The Queen wore an adult human skull, velvet coloured hair framing a heart shaped face. Her clothes were patchwork, a dress made of white silk. 

She looked human at first glance, before her features were narrowing, like she was screwing with my perception. 

Jude lowered himself in front of them, yanking me with him.

Kneeling in front of the king, I could still see the skeletal smile of the victim sitting on top of his head. 

I could see exactly where their head had been savagely severed from their torso. 

His clothes were made up of flesh that had been dried and stitched together. I had to bow my head, swallowing a shriek. 

“He's wearing someone's skull,” I managed to breathe, my chest aching. 

Jude shot me a glare, and there was a splinter of his human self. “Be quiet.” 

Oh, so he could speak. 

The Queen stood, and spoke in a language I could not understand. 

Looking at Jude, at the knot between his brow, he could hear what she was saying in perfect clarity. To me, however, it was a colourful tongue twister language. “She’s asking all of her children to present themselves to her,” he murmured. 

“What does that mean?” 

“That something big is about to happen,” Jude  hummed. “Stand up. The Queen asks her children to present themselves to her only three times a day. Dawn, high eve, and late eve.” 

“What?”

He didn't reply, the sound of footsteps taking me off guard. They took their places next to the King and Queen.

I recognised Levi immediately, still dressed in the remnants of his Adventure Time sweater. 

His hair was overgrown, skin blistered and burned resembling a Stray. 

Unlike Jude's, his crown looked like it had been forced onto his head, splinters of bone glued to his skull, threaded vines and flowers adorning his hair. Levi’s eyes were empty of that glitter I remembered, when he called fake Santa a meth head. 

His smile was too wide. I could see blisters on his mouth where his lips had been sewn shut. I didn't want to see it, but I saw the exact transformation, slight points in ears hiding behind thick reddish curls, his face narrower, malnourished cheeks sticking out.

Following those same inky black lines marking his face, I wondered if male fae bore them. Just from looking at Levi Parish, the boy had fought a battle he had lost, ending in him bearing a crown forced on his head, and vacant eyes. 

Next to him…Thalia. 

She was perhaps the most transformed from the three. Her naked back had been twisted into something inhuman. 

I could see where her spine used to be, now something was growing from her flesh, something writhing up and down her skin, trying to burst out. Thalia’s hair was entangled in flowers and vines, a crown of thorn sitting on top of her head, instead of glued on like the boy's. 

Half of her pretty face had been scorched, and then clawed away, ugly flaps of flesh where her cheek was supposed to be. 

I could still see the claw marks on her neck, streaks of red. 

And yet, just like the boys, her grin was wide. 

The smile I knew was gone.

Looking at all three of them, it hit me that my friends weren't heirs to the throne. 

They were toys. 

Playthings.

Canvases for fae children. 

“Mother.” Jude lifted his head, smiling wide. “Father.” 

“Ruby.” The Queen’s voice was melodic. She rose gracefully. “I am so glad you finally came to your senses.”

I lifted my head.  “I had no choice.”

“Careful.” Jude breathed. “The last time I spoke back to them, I got the flesh melted off of my back.”

The Queen's lips curled. “Human child, do speak louder. You are mumbling.”

Instead of responding, I bowed my head. I was speaking before I could stop myself. “I’d like to… make a request.” 

“And what is that?” The Queen asked, tilting her head. “Speak clearly, Ruby.”

“An exchange.” I forced out. ""I would like to request that I exchange myself, Thalia Wednesday, Levi Parish and…” 

I struggled to speak, the words tangled on my tongue. My gaze flicked to Jude’s bruised knees, the thorns wrapped around this neck which were constantly squeezing breath from his lungs. “And Jude Whitlock.” I spat out. “For four human children of the same age.""

I stopped when Jude grabbed my arm, his eyes suddenly fearful. Terrified. His lips were twisted, failing to form words.

“What are you doing?!” His expression screamed.

“I accept.” 

I risked lifting my head, and she was smiling. 

“Ruby, you are yet to become my full blooded daughter, and you are already pledging yourself to rounding up human children!” She spoke with a manic giggle. 

“My, now how could I reject an offer like that? We are already in a deal for fifteen children this Christmas. Five more would be a luxury. Oh, the things we could do.""

Her words sent slithers down my spine. “No.” I said. “No, I didn’t mean—“

My feet left the ground, and I was choking, suddenly. The breath had been sucked from my lungs, and I felt them.. invisible fingers wrapped around my neck, squeezing. I was aware of my body hovering several feet off of the ground. 

The Queen sat back down. 

“You did not mean what?”

“I…”

“I don’t think you’ve been educated in our laws,” she said smoothly. “You do not speak my children's names. Do so again, and I will rip out your tongue.”

A fountain of red escaped my mouth, and I could feel something sharp winding its way around my neck. Like claws it stabbed into my flesh. I felt my head spin, my vision blur. I was going to die, I thought. I was going to fucking die at eighteen years old, when my replica was out there living my life— and there I was choking on my own blood.

When I dropped to the ground, the Queen cleared her throat. “Speak clearly. You didn’t mean what?”

I couldn’t speak. The words were shredded in my throat.

“She didn’t mean to bad mouth you, Mother.” Jude hissed out. “The… human child has a sharp tongue, and I ask just this once. Please spare her request, and her stupidity. What Ruby meant was a gift,” he said. “She will gift you four human children in exchange for your kindness and hospitality. As well as your forgiveness  and a seat in the court.”

He wrenched me to my feet and dragged me in a bow. 

My chest was aching, blood dripping from my mouth and chin. But I bowed. 

I bowed three times. And each one was progressively more humiliating. 

When my face hit the ground for the third time, the Queen cleared her throat.

“I accept!” her eyes lit up. “Ruby, you must be so hungry! Please! Eat!”

A table was brought in filled with fruit and berries, and further down the table, a human teenager skewered on a stick. His mouth was wide open, teeth pulled out, a bright red apple stuffed inside.

That was when my mind started to slowly break apart. 

When the half human, half fae heirs began to rip flesh from bone, giggling manically, chewing through splattered scarlet dripping from the table. Jude handed me a goblet and told me to drink. It tasted like strawberry milk.  

The windchimes started in my head, growing louder until I was laughing myself, choking on a scream trying to claw its way up my throat. 

When my crown was lowered onto my head, pricks of glass and bone cutting into my scalp, warm blood slipping down my temple, I felt dizzying happiness and unbridled fear, my lips splitting into a grin that wasn't mine. 

I was home. 

I don't know how long it had been since the feast. 

Since the crown on my head stopped hurting, and blood started like tasting like milkshakes.

I was dancing, a whirlwind of color around me, dancing inside the wooden cage, dancing for my life. If my audience did not like my dancing, then I would be punished. I was twirling around and around, my thoughts cotton candy, until I stamped on something. 

Something…sharp. 

Something that went straight through my bare foot. 

A nail. 

The pain was enough to wake me up, and when I was blinking rapidly, drinking in the pooling red I had been dancing in, a river of blood staining my legs, did I look up and see a familiar face peering through the wooden bars. 

His crown of thorns was still glued to his head but I could see claw marks where he'd tried and failed to pull it off. 

Levi. 

He was awake.

1h9z8r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/1h9z8r6/lmk_your_experience_wglomerulonephritis/,Lmk your experience w/glomerulonephritis,"I (21F) just went to see the urologist last week, and I just wanted to hear from people with glomerulonephritis. I’ve had digestive issues all my life and they’re mostly associated with anxiety or foods I have intolerances to. That being said, I started having intense nausea starting around my first year of college. I figured it was because I moved to a place with a warmer climate, but I couldn’t stop drinking water. If I did, I would feel even more nauseous than my base level nausea. This made it increasingly hard to attend class because I couldn’t get up quickly or take naps during the day. This nausea was especially bad if I ate anything with robust flavor, anything spicy, greasy, or red meats, so I stuck with chicken, rice, salads, pasta, and vegetables as my safe foods. I drank coffee maybe 2-3 times a week and alcohol once a month because both would increase my nausea, and I’m incredibly scared of throwing up. I started having more frequent “episodes” where I would eat something that my stomach wouldn’t agree with and it would set my body into a sweat and stomach cramps before having really bad runs. I would usually take nauzene during times like these, but I had been having “episodes” since around my 6th grade year. 

Well within the past year of my freshman and sophomore years in college, I also started getting strep(?) more frequently (or a throat infection at least). I got strep pretty much every year as a child, but the middle of March of this year is when I saw blood in my urine too. I had already gone to the doctor, and they gave me antibiotics, but I went back to get a urinalysis done. They failed to tell me the results couldn’t be read properly due to the antibiotics in my system already, but my urine went back to normal within a day regardless, so I didn’t worry much about it. I came down with strep(?) again around the end of September, and I saw blood in my urine before I went to the school clinic. They said the strep test was negative like the time before, so they diagnosed me with pharyngitis and a possible UTI and gave me antibiotics. The urinalysis they did came back with increased protein levels but regular white blood cell levels, so there wasn’t an infection. I got a throat infection in mid November after this, and I went back. Unfortunately, they asked if it was my period, diagnosed me with allergies, and sent me on my way (same doctor as last time). The results of the urinalysis showed no infection again and increased protein levels. I couldn’t sleep through the night for three nights straight because of the throat pain, and the blood lasted for around 4-5 days. Rusty colored to bright red to rusty again.

In addition, I’ve had pretty recent symptoms including frequent urination, a nonstop dribble when I need to stop urinating, and sensitivity to sweets (they make me feel nauseous too now).
I have taken a pregnancy test btw, and I know I don’t have any STDs

I got an appointment with a urologist at my parents’ request. I went and they said their best guess was glomerulonephritis based off the symptoms I gave, but they went ahead and did another urinalysis, an ultrasound, and a blood test in office. The urinalysis showed increased protein levels, but it also showed microscopic red blood cells despite my urine being a normal color that day. They said the normal amount of red blood cells was usually around 0-5, and I had around 43-60. The urologist also said that they saw a little swelling in my right kidney from the ultrasound. The blood tests aren’t back yet, but they referred me to a nephrologist in town and suggested a CT scan which will likely be after the holidays

I just wanted to hear from other people and get to know their experiences because I don’t know how many of my symptoms are related and how many I might need to get checked out with someone else. I’m fully aware I only have the iffy diagnosis from the urologist and it isn’t a full diagnosis, but I think it might give me a little peace of mind knowing other people have similar experiences. I’m in no way expecting anyone to fully diagnose me or cater to my feelings here. I know that I won’t have any true answers until I see a specialist. I just feel a little alone in my experience right now because I don’t know anyone else with these issues.",2,1733710558.0,kidneydisease,2,1.0,False
