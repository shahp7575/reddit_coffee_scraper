This guy liked my photo so I matched back and messaged him. I saw that he included his Instagram so after some time I messaged him on Instagram since I saw he worked a job I understood to have long hours. I thought his putting his ig handle on his profile could be a beige flag but I didn't want to assume anything.

He replied pretty quick and asked to jump a phone call same day at 5:30.

Personally I don’t like hoping immediately on a video call with someone I haven’t chatted with for too long, so I let him know I could do a call, which he agreed to.

When he called me, I could hear traffic in the background and I asked if he was safe to be on the phone. He told me not to worry because he was on speaker phone and his car can self drive.

Okay, so I already only have a fraction of your attention. Cool.

We did ask each other questions but he kind of drove the conversation, he asked in the following order

1. Job
2. How long I’ve been the area
3. Where did I grow up
4. What did I do for fun
5. My relationship history
6. My long term goals

I answered each earnestly and asked same back to him. He did answer everything too, but he had a tendency to interrupt me and move on to the next question

What I learned about him was that he had several long term relationships and the last one was an engagement that ended by the girl, due to ‘incompatibility.’

Then as I was talking he interrupted me mid sentence and told me he had another call in 30 minutes and we should get coffee if ever came to the area (we live about an hour apart from each other). What really disgusted me was how when he interrupted me, he had started the conversation about his desire to have kids so I was actually in the middle of my serious opinion on that subject, it felt extremely disrespectful.

Men: dating is not a job interview. Although I didn’t feel compatibility either, I felt really gross from the entire interaction, like a product on the shelf

When someone agrees to give you some time out of their day, you should assume they’re doing so with sincerity, and the least you can do for that sincerity and frankly vulnerability is have the decency to give them your full attention for the entirety of the conversation.

I get a lot of guys who want to call or video chat first before meeting but stuff like this thing makes me really adverse to considering it unless I’m sure this person is really interested.

There’s been times when I have video call with someone I already am not sure about, but I always give my full attention, and end conversation when I’m sure the other person feels comfortable (unless I feel unsafe myself).

This guy used the excuse that I talked too much about work, he complained I asked too much about his work and that he was getting off work and didn't want to think about work.

I told him: I just got off work myself, and I’m tired too. It sounds like you want me to entertain or romance you, I don’t know what kind of woman is gonna be able to woo you on the first conversation over the phone you ever had with them as you drive home from work. Maybe she’s out there, but what you’re asking for is a lot for anyone. I also told him to kick rocks on coffee because we both know that’s a lie.

He got pretty cold and hung up. Good riddance

TLDR: Dating isn't a job interview, and if you treat it that way, you're ruining the experience for everyone",2,1745475096.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

The Sirtfood Diet has taken the world by storm as a natural approach to kick start the body’s fat-burning processes and improve health. Beloved by the likes of Adele and other stars and fitness pros, this diet encourages eating sirtuins-protein-rich foods that control metabolism, inflammation, and aging.

The Sirtfood Diet might be just the ticket if you want to shed excess weight, lose belly fat and improve health and well-being. This guide covers what this diet is, its benefits, and a complete 7-day meal plan to get you started.

# What is the Sirtfood Diet?

The Sirtfood Diet is based on the idea of stimulating sirtuins — proteins that regulate metabolism, fat burning and aging. The diet also contains proteins that regulate normal cellular function and promote fat oxidation. Hence, the diet is effective to lose weight and also for general well being.

# How Does It Work?

Sirtuins sense low energy or nutrients, which is elicited by caloric restriction or exercise, resulting in heightened fat metabolism and less inflammatory response. Research has shown that activating these proteins can enhance cellular repair, stimulate metabolism, and extend lifespan.

# Top Sirtfoods Include:

* Kale
* Green tea (especially matcha)
* Unsweetened dark chocolate (at least 85% cocoa)
* Turmeric
* Red wine
* Walnuts
* Coffee
* Blueberries
* Citrus fruits
* Olive oil

Eating these foods can naturally support fat burning, increase cellular activity and overall wellness.

# Benefits of the Sirtfood Diet

# Promotes Weight Loss and Loss of Fat

Stimulating the sirtuins boosts the body's potential to burn already stored fat and keeps in muscle. This makes it an efficient choice for sustainable weight loss.

# Boosts Metabolism

Sirtfoods may also promote good metabolic function which will help keep a sustainable weight long-term.

# Preserves Lean Muscle Mass

The Sirtfood Diet as opposed to so many restrictive diets will allow you to maintain muscle, meaning that you are only losing fat and not lean muscle mass.

Stimulates Longevity and Cellular Anti-Aging

That’s because sirtuins are linked with anti-aging and better cellular repair, meaning this diet is more than just lost pounds.

Vespera Gildon stood outside the president's office, her body stiff as if encased in ice. Her black stilettos seemed to merge with the dark marble floor beneath her.

After a long pause, she finally raised her hand and knocked on the door.

A deep, familiar voice responded from inside. ""Come in.""

Vespera tightened her grip on the documents in her hand and pushed the door open with the other. As she stepped inside, she forced a faint smile onto her face and approached Luke.

""Are you busy? There are a few urgent documents that need your signature."" Even as Vespera asked, she had already placed the papers before him, flipping them open to the pages that required his signature.

Luke had just returned from a business trip to Shawford earlier that morning. He had come straight to the office to tackle the mountain of work waiting for him. His desk was cluttered with files, and his handsome, well-defined face bore traces of exhaustion.

Without even glancing at the documents, he signed them quickly. ""Thanks for your hard work.""

Vespera gathered the signed papers and asked, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

""I have plans tonight. You don't need to wait for me,"" he replied without looking up.

""Okay. I'll head out then."" Vespera turned and walked away, clutching the documents. As she did, her smile faded into a cold, mocking expression.

As Vespera passed the restroom in the office, a faint sound reached her ears. It seemed like a small animal jumping off the bed and landing on the floor.

Her gaze swept over the couch area, where a few snack wrappers and a half-finished milk tea lay on the coffee table. On the floor, a pastel pink high heel lay tipped over.

Everything became clear instantly. Her heart turned cold, crumbling into ash.

Vespera returned to her office. The short walk back drained all her energy. When she finally sat down, she let out a long, weary sigh.

She pulled one document from the stack in her hands. It was a divorce agreement.

Flipping to the last page, Vespera traced the lines of his signature with a mocking expression, her mind flashing back to memories.

Luke vowed to marry Vespera back then. However, Vespera's mother-in-law warned her not to get too comfortable, as no man could stay loyal to one woman forever.

Vespera was naive enough to believe they were different. But what difference was there?

Luke had cheated on her with a young woman. He was convinced he was hiding it well, indulging in the thrill of his affair. He had even brought her along on his business trip to Shawford. And now, he had brought her back to the office.

Vespera withdrew her finger and snapped a photo of the signed divorce agreement. She then sent it to her mother-in-law, Fiona Reeds, with a simple message. ""He signed it.""

A week ago, Vespera had struck a deal with Fiona. She demanded that Vespera initiate the divorce and keep their secret marriage hidden from the public. In return, Vespera had asked for a billion-dollar settlement.

In a month, Luke would be completely out of her life.

Just then, a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts.

After keeping the divorce agreement, Vespera said, ""Please enter.""

The door opened, and Luke's assistant, Osbert Madron, stepped inside.

""Ms. Gildon, Mr. Munoz asked me to pass this to you,"" Osbert said, placing a dark green velvet box in front of her.

Vespera casually opened the box and found an expensive diamond jewelry set. But the first thing that flashed through her mind was a dazed, short-haired girl in a bathrobe, carelessly holding up a diamond necklace. The room bathed in dim, suggestive lighting, the bed rumpled, and the girl's chest marked with unmistakable love bites.

A wave of nausea churned in her stomach.

""Thank you, Mr. Madron.""

Osbert felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Verspera's threatening gaze. He couldn't help but add, ""Mr. Munoz personally selected this. It's one of a kind in the world.""

It's too bad that Luke's heart wasn't one of a kind; she no longer wanted it.

Vespera smiled faintly. ""Really? How touching that he found time in his busy schedule to buy me a gift.""

Something in her voice didn't quite align. Osbert's unease deepened as he broke into a cold sweat. Did she know about Luke and Tina Sowle? He mumbled an excuse and fled from the office.

Vespera looked at the jewelry on the desk with disdain, as if it were filthy. She took out her phone, snapped a photo, and sent it to the owner of a luxury resale shop.

Then, she instructed, ""Sell this for me and donate the proceeds to the Foundation for Children with Intellectual Disabilities.""

The resale shop owner was speechless.

…

At 5:00 pm, Vespera had just reached her car and was about to open the door when her gaze casually swept across the parking garage. She noticed a car idling diagonally across from her.

Through the window, she saw Luke in the backseat, a short-haired woman nestled close to him. The woman had a round, cute face and radiated youthful energy.

""Mr. Munoz!"" Osbert gasped, slamming on the brakes.

Separated by glass and a stretch of space, Vespera's eyes found Luke's.

Chapter 2

Luke's eyes were dark and unreadable, while Vespera's were lifeless, devoid of emotion.

The atmosphere in the garage was tense.

Despite noticing Verspera, the woman didn't bother to distance herself from Luke. Instead, she grew even bolder, wrapping her arms around his neck and whispering something into his ear.

Vespera felt disgusted by the scene. She looked away, got into her car, and drove off without glancing back.

…

Shortly after arriving home, Vespera heard the sound of another car pulling up outside.

As she reached up to unfasten the clasp of her necklace before the glass cabinet in the walk-in closet, a towering presence loomed behind her. The man's commanding presence filled the small space, completely enveloping her.

His hands pressed against the glass cabinet, angling himself to study her face from the side. ""Are you angry?""

Vespera avoided his gaze. She took her time putting the necklace away before replying indifferently, ""I'm angry enough to kill. You'd better watch your back.""

Luke fell silent for a moment before speaking again. ""The Sowle family is interested in collaborating with us on the Polaris project. I've been in talks with Austin Sowle, their eldest son. That woman is his sister, Tina Sowle.""

""So if you don't entertain his sister, he won't work with you?""

""Vespera, I'm trying to explain. Don't be sarcastic.""

""I don't think it's necessary to explain."" Vespera finally turned to look at Luke. Her gaze seemed to pierce his soul. ""Luke, if you're tired of me and want to replace me as the lady of this house, I can step aside.""

Luke's expression darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""

She sighed and replied, ""We can get a divorce.""

As Vespera tried to push him away and leave, Luke yanked her back forcefully. Then, he gripped her face and warned, ""Don't even think about it.""

Vespera didn't respond. Not only had she thought about it—she had already taken action. She didn't want to be with him anymore.

Luke stayed home until late that night—until an unexpected phone call summoned him away. Vespera caught the faint sound of a tearful voice on the other end of the line.

…

The next morning, Vespera's lawyer and close friend, Rebecca Snyder, who was handling her divorce, sent her a screenshot. It was a new post from Luke's girlfriend—a photo of two hands, one noticeably larger than the other, forming a heart against a scenic sunrise. The caption read, ""When love greets the day"".

Vespera recognized the larger hand instantly—it was Luke's. She sat frozen, her fingers curled around a glass of water. She wasn't sure how long she had been gripping it.

The sharp, clear sound of the cup hitting the surface triggered a feeling of loss in Vespera. It was as if something within her had broken too.

Days passed, and Luke never returned home. Their only encounters were in company meetings—him at the head of the table, her among the executives. They didn't look at each other, and Vespera never once went to find him at his office either.

Instead, she filled her time searching for apartments and methodically discarding every gift he had ever given her—anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding mementos. She even sold her wedding ring.

Why hold onto reminders of a love she no longer wanted?

…

That evening, Elena Hortwall, the lady boss of Westfield Group, invited Vespera to join her at a club.

At first, Vespera hesitated—it was already close to eleven—but after some thought, she decided to go.

Now that she was divorced and would be leaving Eclipse Group, she would need connections for her business ventures.

As soon as she stepped into the club, she spotted Elena.

""I could have gone up by myself. You didn't have to come down,"" Vespera said.

Elena linked arms with her affectionately as they stepped into the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost. You've never been here before, have you?""

That was true. She hadn't.

The two headed upstairs, and Elena led Vespera into a spacious private room. A large screen stood in the center, dividing the space.

As they entered, Vespera noticed a few people on the other side of the screen, but Elena didn't take her there. Instead, she led her to a quieter section with only one other person. That person looked vaguely familiar, possibly the girlfriend of one of Luke's friends.

The woman seemed to recognize Vespera too. Though she looked slightly uneasy, she still managed a polite smile.

After Vespera removed her coat and sat down, Elena left.

Vespera lifted the drink given to her, taking a slow sip. From beyond the screen, the cheerful sounds of conversations drifted over—until suddenly, her name was mentioned.

""Luke doesn't bring Vespera to our gatherings anymore.""

""Of course not. Ms. Sowle is young and adorable. He takes her everywhere now, like she's the center of his universe.""

""Guess Luke finally changed his taste after all these years.""

""No matter how beautiful Vespera is, eight years in bed with the same woman? He must be bored out of his mind.""

""She's such a fool. After all that time with Luke, she was just a placeholder. Hey, if he doesn't want her anymore, maybe I should take a shot. I've had my eye on that waist of hers for years.""

…

Vespera's gaze turned ice-cold. She recognized two of the voices; they were friends of Luke, men who had always addressed her as Mrs. Munoz with excessive sweetness.

The woman beside her looked mortified, unwilling to meet her gaze. When Vespera rose from her seat, she assumed she was about to flee in embarrassment.

But Vespera did no such thing. Instead, she cleared her throat, picked up her drink, and strolled leisurely to the other side of the screen.

She leaned against it, tilting her head as she addressed the group in an easy, conversational tone. ""Just so we're all on the same page—when Luke and I first got together, he was an inexperienced virgin. So really, wasn't I the one who got to use him for eight years for free?""

The room fell silent. Every face on the couch stiffened in utter disbelief.

And before anyone could recover, two tall figures stepped into the room.

The group stiffened further, eyes darting between Vespera and the men standing behind her, dread settling deep in their bones.

Chapter 3

Luke stood behind Vespera, his presence exuding an icy chill.

Sensing the shift in the room, Vespera glanced over her shoulder. So, he had been here all along.

She quickly turned back, her gaze landing on the short-haired woman sitting in the corner of the couch. Earlier, Tina had been lounging smugly, one leg crossed over the other, absentmindedly twirling her hair around her finger.

But now, her expression had completely soured. Her smile was gone, replaced by a murderous glare.

It was clear Luke and Tina had been meeting up with the rest. Judging by their friends' casual tone, this wasn't just a one-time occurrence—it had happened enough times that they no longer bothered to hide it.

Luke took a step forward. The group, as if suddenly released from paralysis, sprang into action.

""We're sorry! We were just talking nonsense.""

""Mrs. Munoz, nothing is going on between Luke and Ms. Sowle!""

""Mrs. Munoz, please don't take it seriously.""

Luke grabbed Vespera's wrist, intent on dragging her away. But before he could, she turned and threw her drink straight into his face.

The room fell into a dead silence. Everyone watched, their scalps tingling. Did she really just do that?

Then, Vespera flashed a wide smile and said, ""Enjoy your time with your sweetheart. I wouldn't want to spoil the fun.""

She lowered her head, attempting to pry his fingers off her wrist.

Luke's expression darkened. Without a word, he scooped her up, slung her over his shoulder, and strode out.

The room fell silent.

Out in the hallway, Vespera struggled fiercely against his hold. Just then, the elevator doors slid open.

As Luke stepped inside and turned around, her eyes were drawn to the sleek black leather shoes, the straight legs clad in tailored black suit pants, and the pale, slender hands resting at his sides. His fingers were long and elegant.

The atmosphere was thick with silence and unease.

As they exited the elevator, Vespera couldn't resist looking up. She saw a pair of deep, piercing eyes staring down at her.

Vespera was speechless as she lowered her head, covering her face.

Outside the club, Luke tossed her into the car's back seat before getting in himself.

Dizzy and disoriented, Vespera sat up. After being upside down for so long and then thrown into the car, she felt like she might have a concussion.

Luke pulled a wet wipe from the car's compartment and began wiping his face.

Out of the corner of her eye, Vespera caught a glimpse of something behind the tissue box—it looked like a condom.

Before she could say anything, Luke demanded, ""Why did you come here? To catch me cheating?""

Disgusted, she reached for the door handle, ready to get out. The car was filthy.

""Vespera!"" Luke yanked her back inside, his voice filled with irritation. ""Where do you think you're going? Are you done yet?""

Her breathing was unsteady. She pressed her fingertips and murmured, ""I want to go home.""

Luke called Osbert, who was waiting outside the club, and told him to drive.

The ride was silent. Vespera sat as far from Luke as possible, her complexion pale as if she might throw up at any moment.

When they finally arrived home, she wasted no time getting out of the car.

Vespera hurried to the kitchen and gulped a full glass of ice-cold water. Finally, she felt slightly better.

When she returned to the living room, Luke was already seated. She walked over and sat down as well. Another suffocating silence stretched between them.

Finally, Luke spoke. ""I was there to discuss a project. You stormed into the club and made a scene. I'm so humiliated. Do you have any idea how foolish, how repulsive you looked? You behaved like a shrew.""

""Okay. Anything else?"" Vespera asked calmly.

""If you still want this relationship to last, stop these unnecessary suspicions. I don't have time to cater to your emotions.""

""Alright. Anything else?""

Luke frowned and replied, ""Do you have any idea how annoying you are right now?""

Vespera smiled faintly as she stood up. Soon, he won't have to be annoyed anymore. With that, she turned and headed upstairs.

Luke's irritation grew at her smile. After sitting in the living room for a while, he went upstairs to their bedroom, only to find that she had already gone to bed. He showered and lay down beside her.

In the darkness, Vespera turned away from him, shifting toward the edge of the bed to avoid any contact.

Luke turned and embraced her, forcefully pulling her from the edge into his arms. His movements tinged with anger.

His tall, strong frame easily overpowered her, holding her so tightly she couldn't move. So, she spent the night rigid in his embrace.

The next morning, Vespera only prepared breakfast for herself. When Luke went downstairs, he found her eating bread alone. As he was about to leave, he changed directions and approached the dining area.

Leaning close to her ear, he said gently, ""Let's go out to the sea this weekend, just the two of us.""

Vespera hummed in response while drinking her milk. Unsurprisingly, the day before the weekend, he canceled on her again, saying he needed to fly to Holsword.

Vespera felt nothing. Perhaps Luke hadn't even realized how long it had been since they last shared a meal or truly spent time together. He warned her against entertaining thoughts of divorce, yet in reality, he treated her like she was invisible, as if it made no difference whether she was there or not.

That weekend, Vespera packed the books from her shelf and moved them to her new home. As she was arranging them, her phone rang. It was her mother-in-law, Felicia Jensen.

Vespera answered and politely said, ""Hello, Mrs. Munoz.""

Felicia's voice carried its usual condescension. ""Come over. We need to finalize the document we discussed earlier.""

""Is that really necessary?""

""It is if I say so.""

""Okay. I'll come by this afternoon.""

""No, come at noon.""

""Fine.""

Vespera agreed, as she had no other plans.

Meanwhile, Felicia stood by the window, watching with satisfaction as Luke and Tina strolled in the garden. She wanted Vespera to see what a truly perfect couple looked like.

Chapter 4

Vespera arrived at the Munoz residence at 11:40 am.

The butler, Walter Osland, was visibly startled to see her. He knew another guest was expected today but hadn't realized it would be Vespera. His forehead broke into a cold sweat at the thought of Luke and Tina in the living room.

Very few people knew about Vespera and Luke's marriage. Aside from their parents, only a handful of close aides, including Osbert and Walter, were aware of the truth.

""This way."" Walter had no choice but to follow Felicia's instructions. He braced himself as he led Vespera inside.

Before they reached the living room, a sweet, affectionate voice rang out. ""I won again. Luke, were you letting me win on purpose?""

Vespera stopped in her tracks. Her mind suddenly went blank. Then, everything became crystal clear.

She couldn't help but let out a cold laugh before entering the living room.

Vespera had been shifting her books earlier, so she hadn't bothered with makeup today. She was dressed casually in a loose white shirt and jeans. Her long hair was gathered into a loose ponytail with a simple ribbon.

Yet, even in such an understated look, her skin remained fair, and her dark eyes were striking against the natural redness of her lips. A few stray strands of hair fell against her cheek, adding an unintentional touch of allure to her beauty.

Luke was taken aback to see Vespera. ""Why are you—""

""Your mom called me over,"" Vespera interrupted coolly. She glared at Luke and continued, ""Weren't you supposed to be in Holsword? When did you learn to teleport?""

Luke was at a loss for words as a flicker of guilt flashed across his eyes.

Tina rose from the couch and walked up to Vespera, extending a hand with a provocative smile.

""Hello, I'm Tina Sowle.""

Vespera didn't spare her a glance, treating her as if she were nothing more than air.

Just then, Felicia entered the living room. She cast a brief look at Vespera before affectionately holding Tina's hand. ""Did you have fun today? Make yourself at home.""

Then, she introduced Vespera. ""This is Ms. Vespera Gildon. She works at Eclipse Group. I asked her to come over for a discussion.""

Everyone knew Vespera was Luke's wife. Yet Felicia deliberately reduced her to nothing more than a company employee, making it clear she had no intention of acknowledging her as family. This also told Tina that Vespera was insignificant and didn't threaten Luke and Tina's impending marriage.

Tina lifted her chin proudly. ""Oh? She's just a company employee?""

Vespera didn't react to either of them. Instead, she turned her gaze to Luke and watched him in silence. She wanted to see how he would respond.

However, Luke merely sat there, his face as cold and indifferent as ever, making no effort to correct the insult.

Did he not understand what was happening? No. He understood perfectly. He just didn't care if she was humiliated.

Vespera turned to Felicia and said, ""Mrs. Munoz, didn't you call me here for a discussion? Let's just speak here.""

""We can discuss another day. Since you're already here, stay for lunch.""

""I won't be staying for lunch. I have other matters to attend to.""

With that, Vespera turned to leave.

Felicia bellowed, ""How can you show such disrespect when an elder invites you to a meal? Where are your manners?""

Vespera turned and looked at her. After a short pause, she said, ""Okay. I'll stay for lunch. Just don't regret it.""

Then, she walked over and chose a single-seat chair for herself.

Tina sat beside Luke and wrapped her arm around his. ""Let's continue our game.""

Luke pulled his arm away and looked at Vespera. ""Do you know how to play checkers, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera glanced at the exquisite set on the table and quickly noticed the game strategy. It was such a simple setup, and yet Luke lost.

So, he did know how to humor someone. Just not her.

Vespera lifted her gaze and smirked at Luke. ""I do. Would you like to play, Ms. Sowle?""

Luke's expression darkened slightly, his gaze flashing with warning.

Tina confidently reset the board. ""White or black, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera picked up a black piece and said, ""Black. Seems fitting for me.""

Luke was speechless, while Felicia and Tina were about to laugh at her self-deprecation—plenty of people got shaded, but few shaded themselves.

Yet, after a few seconds, they realized she wasn't mocking herself. She was mocking them.

Tina clenched her teeth and made the first move. Piece by piece, the game unfolded.

Felicia noticed how strategically Tina had placed her pieces while Vespera's moves seemed scattered and aimless. She was biased toward Tina, so she didn't analyze the game carefully.

Then, Felicia shot Luke a look. That was the difference between a well-bred lady from a prestigious family and a nobody. However, Luke showed no reaction.

The game continued, and each time Tina thought she was about to win, Vespera blocked her path. Her emotions fluctuated with each turn, and she grew increasingly impatient. Still, she reassured herself that the match would end in a draw even if she couldn't win. It was disgraceful to tie with Vespera, after all.

""Your move,"" Vespera said.

Tina had already placed three pieces in a hidden corner. If she could just add one more, victory was hers.

She feigned composure and made her move. Then, she anxiously watched and prayed that Vespera didn't notice.

When Vespera placed her next piece elsewhere, Tina declared triumphantly, ""I win!""

Felicia immediately applauded in delight. However, they soon watched in stunned silence as Vespera began calmly collecting the pieces. They noticed that she had already won the game.

Felicia and Tina went pale.

Chapter 5

Vespera collected the remaining two pieces.

The checkers game was supposed to be winner-takes-all, but Tina was unwilling to accept defeat. So, she decided to act shamelessly.

""Even though you won first, I also have five in a row now. So I win too."" She defiantly placed another piece on her row of four, claiming victory.

Vespera stared at Tina briefly as if she were a fool. ""Well, if that's the case, I guess I can keep going too.""

With that, she placed another piece on the board, easily completing another row of five.

Over the next minute, Vespera nearly cleared the board, blocking Tina at every turn until the latter couldn't make any move.

Tina's face turned red, then pale, and she demanded a rematch.

Second game, third game, fourth game...

Vespera either toyed with Tina, slowly crushing her spirit, or ended the game swiftly with precise, ruthless moves. Having been treated like a fool, Tina burst into tears.

""Enough!"" Luke snatched the game box from Vespera's hands with an icy expression.

Seeing Luke take her side, Tina threw herself into his arms, sobbing as if Vespera had bullied her.

Luke and Felicia comforted Tina. Then, the latter scolded Vespera, ""It's just a game of checkers. Why take it so seriously? You're so petty and competitive. It's clear you come from a poor family!""

The voices around Vespera blurred into a meaningless hum.

Luke's face, once so bright and radiant in her eyes, now seemed like a faded, distorted film reel, unrecognizable and dull.

Whatever. 20 more days. She'd let him do as he pleased.

Vespera tossed the remaining pieces onto the board, her expression bored and indifferent. She then stood up and walked away.

A few drops of blood fell onto the board as she scattered the pieces. It wasn't until she stepped outside and felt the coolness on her fingers that she realized she had been clenching her fists so tightly that her nails had dug into her palms, drawing blood.

""Vespera!"" Luke called after her, his voice finally tinged with a hint of panic.

He tried to chase after Vespera, but Tina clung to his waist, crying even harder.

Vespera left the Munoz residence. Her phone rang incessantly on the drive as Luke was calling her repeatedly. She blocked his number without hesitation.

Then, Vespera sent a message to Felicia. ""15 million dollars! If you short me even a single cent, I'll make sure you pay dearly for it!""

Felicia nearly had a heart attack when she read the message.

Vespera drove on, the world outside her window shifting as the sky darkened and rain began to fall. Her thoughts scattered like the raindrops, unfocused and drifting.

Suddenly, a flash of yellow zipped past her—a motorcycle swerved recklessly in front of her car. Her heart lurched, and she slammed on the brakes.

The next second, a loud crash jolted Vespera from behind. Her head snapped forward, hitting the steering wheel.

A sharp pain spread from her temple. When she looked up, the rain-soaked world outside was tinged with red. She grabbed a tissue and wiped the blood from her eyes.

Vespera had been rear-ended, and the yellow motorcycle that had cut her off was now nowhere to be seen.

Just then, someone tapped on her car window. Vespera rolled it down to find herself eye-to-eye with a man who appeared to be in his late 40s or early 50s. He was wearing glasses and carrying a sleek black umbrella.

Raymond Chandler's demeanor was calm and polite, his expression apologetic. ""Miss, I'm terribly sorry. I'm the one who collided with you. We'll take full responsibility. My boss is in a bit of a hurry right now, so could we exchange contact information? You can send us a list of damages later, and we'll make sure to cover everything.""

""Let's just wait for the police to handle it,"" Vespera replied flatly.

Vespera was already in a foul mood, and after being startled twice in quick succession, her frustration had reached its breaking point.

She got out of the car and walked to the rear, where she saw the back of her car dented from the collision with the Bentley behind her. Frowning, she took photos for evidence and called the police.

Seeing her insistence, Raymond didn't try to stop her. He returned to his car to report the situation. ""The lady isn't willing to settle privately. What should we do?""

The rain grew heavier. The windshield wipers pushed the rainwater aside, only for the glass to be quickly covered again by a fresh layer of mist.

Inside the car, a man lounged casually, his gaze fixed on Vespera, who was holding her forehead with one hand while talking on the phone.

She radiated intense frustration, her white shirt soaked through by the rain. Droplets clung to her long lashes before falling onto her red lips.

Raymond called out once again. ""Mr. Reid?""

Dominic Reid glanced at his watch before replying, ""Gerard is on his way. I'll leave first. You stay and handle this.""

""Understood.""

Vespera returned to her car. A short while later, the police arrived, followed by a silver Maybach.

The two cars stopped almost simultaneously.

She got out of her car. The occupants of the other car also stepped out.

Aside from Raymond, a tall, elegant figure emerged. His skin was pale, his deep eyes sharp and commanding. When he noticed her gaze, he glanced her way with a piercing look.

The man seemed familiar.

""Give this to her.""

Dominic handed Raymond the suit jacket, which was casually draped over his arm. He then got into the Maybach without a glance.

Raymond hurried over to Vespera with the jacket. ""Miss, your clothes are soaked. Please put this on.""

Vespera looked down and realized her white shirt was clinging to her body, almost revealing her undergarments.

Embarrassed, she accepted the jacket and slipped it on. ""Thank you.""

Raymond spoke quietly with the police officer while the Maybach slowly pulled away, cutting through the rain and disappearing into the mist. Vespera caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man's striking profile.

The jacket still carried its owner's warmth, and a faint, soothing sandalwood scent dispelled the chill of the rain.

The police concluded the matter, and both parties agreed to exchange contact information.

Raymond offered to accompany Vespera to the hospital to have her forehead injury checked, but she politely declined. By now, her mood had settled, and she apologized for her earlier overreaction, admitting it was due to her foul mood rather than their fault.

""I'll have the jacket cleaned and return it to you.""

Raymond didn't argue. He was familiar with Dominic's temperament; even if the jacket were returned, he likely wouldn't want it back. Still, he nodded politely.

Vespera went to the hospital alone.

My husband, our 19-month-old toddler, and I are planning a trip to Taipei this October and we’re super excited but also trying to make sure it’s a fun time for all of us, including our little one.

A few things we’re hoping to get help with:
	•	Which areas in Taipei are toddler-friendly to stay in? Easy access to parks, playgrounds, maybe even stroller-friendly streets?
	•	Any hotel or Airbnb recommendations that cater well to families with young kids?
	•	What are some must-visit places or activities our 19m old might enjoy? (Indoor play cafes, baby-friendly museums, animals, nature spots, etc.)
	•	And for my husband and me: any hidden gem cafes, art spaces, or cool indie places we can sneak off to while baby naps in the stroller?

We love art, good coffee, and finding local spots that aren’t super touristy. We don’t mind taking public transport or walking!

Any advice or suggestions would be super appreciated—thank you in advance!

\- EDM, Alternative music (send me your playlist and we'll share music).

\- Cats, birds (there's something adorable about a pigeon).

\- Spirituality of all kinds (I like to read about obscure cults and religions and entertain the possibility of their beliefs).

\- Mental health awareness (with lived experience I am always ready to discuss).

\- Sci-fi and bizarre movies on streaming (currently watching Andor, recently watched Severance, Silo).

\- Poetry, creative writing (just looking for a muse).

Though at a young age I noticed this and tried to be as quiet as possible only speaking when spoken to or if I have something important to say. And when I really started thinking about it, I have nothing important to say most of the time. I’m very critical of myself and very angry with myself and the world, so I’ve always picked friends who I believed to be better than me as far as character content, and intelligence gods. Though as I’ve gotten older people have only disappointed my expectations and turned out to be even worse than I am. (I’m just dumping shit into the void right now honestly) ive been so anxious throughout life, I would sweat in public spaces like work and the mall just from the pressure of people possibly looking at me, making me shake and walk without any rhythm, stutter stepping occasionally. I was working at a casino for a few years and that only made my anxiety and depression worse along with getting high and drunk everyday as a coping mechanism. I got to see every stereotype a casino has to offer which allowed me to see my inadequacies in other people only fueling my hate for the world and myself. I have a righteous burning rage that I use to have a really hard time quelling but now it’s easier but still a challenge. As a kid my dad was an addict, drunk, and gambler. My stepmom would wake me up at 2:00 a.m. throwing cans at my head and screaming if I forgot to do the coffee or some dumb shit. (Just some backstory) I don’t hate them now that I’m grown, they’re just people who suck and that’s the end of it for me. I’ve had to teach myself how to be a man and to be honest I don’t fucking get it, I don’t get why people are so unaccepting. Why people who are older than me seem to be even shitter than me, when I thought that after such a long time in life they’d be like a wise old owl or some shit. Idk, I use to have the perspective that people where better than the ones I grew up with but turns out my world view was wrong and most men and women are just as shitty as the ones I grew up with. It’s funny how when you’re young you think the world is gonna be better whenever you get out on your own but all I can see now is black and white, sometimes a little grey. I can’t fucking stand myself always neurotic as fuck can’t be like other people and just feel the bare minimum everything makes me feel something, I cried at a fucking tree the other day, like what the fuck dude, I wish I were someone else

As the name suggests, [hydrogen water ](https://wellnessextract.com/blogs/wellness/the-ultimate-guide-to-hydrogen-rich-water-benefits-uses-and-scientific-backing?_pos=5&_sid=db324e4c8&_ss=r?utm_sourcereddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=reddit_post)is regular water enriched with additional molecular hydrogen. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest and lightest molecule, making it easy for the body to absorb. It is renowned for its antioxidant properties, which may help neutralize harmful free radicals.

  
**What is Alkaline Water?**  
Alkaline water is similar to hydrogen water, infused with additional molecules. However, instead of extra hydrogen, alkaline water typically contains extra alkaline minerals such as calcium or magnesium. These minerals help balance the body's pH levels.

**What are the Key Differences Between Hydrogen Water and Alkaline Water?** 

* **Composition:** The composition of hydrogen water and alkaline water is entirely different. Hydrogen water contains molecular hydrogen gas dissolved in water and is also a potent antioxidant. However, alkaline water is infused with minerals to boost pH levels and create a more alkaline environment. 
* **pH Level:** The pH level of hydrogen water is neutral, similar to that of regular water. Alkaline water has a higher pH, making it more alkaline than regular tap water.
* **Antioxidant Properties:** Hydrogen water has a more substantial antioxidant potential, which offers a defense against oxidative stress and helps neutralize harmful free radicals. However, the antioxidant potential of alkaline water is indirect, primarily attributed to its alkaline minerals. 
* **Potential Benefits:** Hydrogen water and alkaline water are both popular for their health benefits. While they work in different ways, let's explore the benefits of each one separately.

**What are the Health Benefits of Hydrogen Water?** 

* **Boost gut health:** Did you know that a balanced and happy gut means a healthier you? The study involved 20 healthy adults who drank hydrogen-rich water. The researchers observed that hydrogen water helped increase the number of beneficial gut bacteria and reduced some harmful bacteria. It also helps to keep your digestive system balanced and promotes better overall gut health. 
* **Improves muscle recovery:** Intense workouts can lead to fatigue and muscle soreness. However, drinking hydrogen-rich water before or during exercise may help reduce fatigue and also enhance energy production in the cells. A narrative review highlights that hydrogen-rich water helps reduce fatigue, improve endurance, and lower muscle damage and inflammation after intense workouts. 
* **Supports blood sugar:** Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is crucial. Clinical trials have shown that daily consumption of hydrogen water helps regulate blood sugar and improves lipid metabolism in individuals with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. ​ 
* **Protects skin cells and damage:** Your skin faces daily environmental stressors. The researchers conducted an experimental study using human skin cells called keratinocytes in a lab setting. They exposed the cells to dehydration and observed signs of oxidative stress and cell damage. However, when they treated the cells with hydrogen-rich water, they successfully reduced the oxidative stress and prevented cell death. 
* **Reduces anxiety and enhances mood:** Did you know that mental health is a key to a healthy life? The study involved 26 healthy adults and showed that those who consumed hydrogen water experienced lower levels of anxiety and better mood compared to the placebo group. Additionally, their autonomic nerve function improved, indicating a better ability to manage stress in daily life. 
* **Enhanced Cognitive Function**: Preliminary research indicates that hydrogen-rich water might have neuroprotective properties. A study published in Medical Gas Research in 2017 found that Parkinson's disease patients who drank hydrogen-rich water for 48 weeks showed improvements in their symptoms compared to those who drank placebo water.

  
**What are the Health Benefits of Alkaline Water?**  


* **May help neutralize acid in the body:** Alkaline water helps reduce acidity caused by diet (e.g., coffee, processed foods), which may help reduce acid reflux and improve digestion. The study found that alkaline water with a pH of 8.8 can help neutralize pepsin, the enzyme that causes acid reflux. It suggests it may benefit people suffering from GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease). 
* **Supports bone health:** Alkaline water may help preserve bone density, especially in aging women. The study shows that postmenopausal women who consumed alkaline mineral water (rich in calcium and bicarbonate) had reduced bone resorption, which means less bone loss over time. 
* **Hydration and performance:** According to some anecdotal reports and small studies, alkaline water may be absorbed more quickly in the body, leading to better hydration after intense workouts. A study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that drinking electrolyzed alkaline water enhanced post-exercise hydration and improved blood flow by reducing blood viscosity more effectively than regular water. 
* **Potential antioxidant effects:** Alkaline water may have mild antioxidant properties due to the added minerals, but it doesn't directly neutralize free radicals.

  
**Hydrogen Water vs. Alkaline Water: Which is Better**  


* Both types of water offer unique advantages; However, hydrogen water stands out for its scientifically supported antioxidant and cellular benefits. 
* Multiple peer-reviewed studies support the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and metabolic benefits of hydrogen water. 
* Alkaline water may help with hydration, acid balance, and potentially bone health, but the clinical evidence is still emerging and less robust. 
* Hydrogen water goes beyond just balancing pH—it helps reduce oxidative stress, improves recovery, supports gut and skin health, and may even enhance mood and cognitive function. 

Let's make it easy: Alkaline water = good for balancing acid and staying refreshed. Hydrogen water = great for recharging your body at the cellular level. 

**Conclusion:** 

So, now you do not need to stay confused about all these types of water. If you're aiming for a healthier lifestyle, it's essential to stay hydrated, eat well, and follow a good wellness routine. Alkaline water is helpful, especially if you deal with acid reflux or want a little mineral boost. It can also support digestion and hydration. But hydrogen water goes further. It may help boost your energy, reduce tiredness, support healthy skin and digestion, and even lift your mood and sharpen your mind. Some studies even say it might help with blood sugar and kidney health. 

So, why wait? Give your body that extra support with hydrogen water. Smart hydration = Better health. Cheers to feeling your best!!",1,1745474367.0,u_WellnessExtractUS,0,1.0,False

I'll be posting here what I did manage to find through the Wayback Machine. I'm making a standalone post so it'd be easier to find for anyone who is curious, since I could not find one online or on here. 

There is a planned Anything You Fancy Event soon as per Fae Fragrance's update, the date? I'm not sure when, but I'm still so happy to see the owner Kylie doing well and hearing from her 🥰 because I've loved the few scents I tried from her. So I am compiling this list for myself and anyone who wants a complete (maybe semi-complete lol) master scent list of those that have been released over the past 3 years on the website. It would be way too much if I included scents from the Pylies Etsy, so I think this will do. 

Below is their General Catalog, Autumn Scents, Holiday Scents, and a few others. I remember from a year ago in their Anything You Fancy Event, there was a mix of these together. I did remember seeing Pastel Pony and Crepes Suzette at the time together. The summer scents lower below were 8 I found under a link for ""new perfumes for summer"", and the 5 winter scents were under a link for ""winter 2024 perfume"". Basically, these are all the scents I've been able to find by messing around with the website and trying out different keywords using Wayback Machine's search tool. (*´∀`)♪

The last time I saw you we were both in a semi crowded room a few tables away from each other. I stole a few shy glances across the room  in order to get a glimpse of your glow hoping to lock with your smiling eyes, all while I was having a semi distracted coffee chat with my friend. I knew it was you when I did a double take, and for some reason your sibling was there too. It was odd. They look just like you. I wish I could ask you why they were there that day. 

I knew you were there and I knew that you knew that that I knew you were there. I could sense it. You even got up and left your sibling at the table by themselves. I didn’t think you could even bear to be in my presence. 

I’m writing about you today because you didn’t indirectly come up in Theraphy, but I had mentioned something to my therapist that related to you. I told my therapist that I haven’t talked about my traumas in months, even those who are the closest to me. The ones closest to me haven’t even asked about my traumas. They were shocked to hear that and felt so sorry for me. And then I thought of you. I still can’t believe you come up in Theraphy. 

You will always be related to one of the most traumatic things to helped to me in my life. In a good and bad way. You are the only one who can directly relate, you are the only one who really cared to know all the details, you are the only one who welcomed all the hard emotions and awkward moments and the numerous times we were both on the verge of tears whenever we’d both talk about this shared trauma. You are the only who cared to ask the right questions. You are the only one who was genuinely curious. God, you’re the only one who cares and I haven’t found anyone else that does. 

No wonder you still come up in therapy. 

I had drinks the other night with another friend and they told me they actually know who you are now. You’ve talked. Just talking a look at you and who you are, they said it makes a lot of sense based on everything I told them about you and me. I had to tell my friend that it sucks so much that you will always be related to this trauma. They told me I have to find a way to disassociate it from you. 

I can’t. I’m in search of new support groups and I haven’t joined on yet and I am hoping and praying I find a better you. 

I’m somewhere new now. I don’t think I’ll see you again, though I visit once a week or so. I’m
Hoping I don’t run into you. But I hope you realize that I’m gone and you come and you text me and you tell me how upset you are I didn’t tell you I left only for me to say in response that “I didn’t think you’d care” to make you feel terrible for the lack of commitment based on the empty promises you’ve made. Or at least that’s how it will go in my head. In my head I haven’t thought further than that. Probably because you won’t reach out even though you find out I’m gone. 


Hopefully this is the last I write about you 

I wish you the best, 

- J

However choosing the right one is not easy hence after testing some of the best models out there, I finally found a few worth recommending.

***Here's a quick list of best French press:***

* [**Cafe Du Chateau Stainless Steel French Press**](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/cafe-du-chateau-french-press-coffee-maker/)

# [1. Cafe Du Chateau Stainless Steel French Press](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/cafe-du-chateau-french-press-coffee-maker/)

This 34oz French press features a 4-level filtration system designed to deliver smooth coffee with no grit. Made from borosilicate glass and stainless steel, it's durable and stylish. It’s BPA-free, meets FDA and European safety standards, and also works well for brewing loose-leaf tea.

# [2. MuellerLiving French Press](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/muellerliving-french-press-coffee-maker-is-it-worth-the-investment/)

The MuellerLiving French press is built from rust-free stainless steel with double-wall insulation that keeps coffee hot longer. Its 4-layer filtration system includes multiple screens and a metal cross plate for a clean, full-bodied brew. It’s also dishwasher safe, easy to clean, and holds 34oz of liquid.

# [3. ESPRO P3 French Press](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/espro-p3-french-press/)

The ESPRO P3 uses double micro-filters to eliminate grit and halt brewing instantly once pressed, giving greater control over flavor. It holds 32oz of coffee and features extra-thick glass (40% thicker than average) for improved heat retention and durability. A safety lock secures the glass in place during use.

# [4. YETI Rambler French Press](https://bestreviewsgeek.com/yeti-rambler-french-press-coffee-maker/)

This 34oz French press is designed for outdoor and heavy-duty use. It features double-wall vacuum insulation and 18/8 stainless steel construction that is rust-resistant and dishwasher safe.

# Final Verdict

If you want something reliable for everyday use, go with the Cafe Du Chateau. For the outdoors or the office, the MuellerLiving press is basically indestructible. If you’re all about clean, pro-level flavor, the ESPRO P3 is your guy. The YETI Rambler is a beast for keeping coffee hot all morning, and if you want something stylish and compact, the QUQIYSO adds serious flair without sacrificing function.",1,1745472219.0,u_JeowJeow,0,1.0,False

So I’ve been poking around the crypto space and got curious  are crypto cards actually useful for everyday stuff like groceries, gas, or that late-night fast food run?

At first, it feels like overkill. Why convert your precious BTC or ETH for a cup of coffee, right? Especially with gas fees, volatility, and taxes hovering like vultures. Traditional cards already work fine. So why bother?

But here’s where it gets interesting:
Crypto cards let you spend your gains without cashing out manually, and some even offer solid cashback in crypto. Plus, you bypass some banking friction in regions with limited financial access. For some, it's not just convenience  it's access.

Is it necessary? Not for everyone. But if you're deep in the ecosystem, want flexibility, or just like living on the edge of finance it kinda starts making sense.

Curious how it feels to buy pizza with DOGE?
You might not need it  until you try it.

1k6kgkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1k6kgkn/what_does_this_mean/,What does this mean?,"I (27F) was approached by (34M) at a business investment summit 2 weeks ago, He sat next to me and introduced himself, currently he works as a consultant helping our company with a little restructuring, so he is acquainted with my dad.

“Are you married? How old are you?”

I said “no and I’m 27”

This really threw me off and I just couldn’t understand why he would ask me that at an event like that. I gave him my business card and left it at that.

He texts me 2 days later “hey how’s it going?” I found out he’s 34 and he’s not married “yeah it would’ve been weird if you were and you had asked me THAT”

The conversation was professional with a mix of personal/casual topics here and there, not a lot of texting between us but “I’d like to hear about it sometime” or “we will discuss more on this soon” got me wondering.

I was in my head for a week before I reached out to him again. I cried because THIS man has me on a chokehold and given my experience, I’ve always been told I come off strong

“Hey, I was wondering if we could pick up where we left off” 

He immediately responded, “we can meet at café X if you’re free today at around X time”

I had prior commitment, but we made plans to meet for coffee the following day. I was ecstatic

One of the first thing he says to me “took you a week, huh?”

Our conversation was great, there was less professionalism and more personal, friendly banter and maybe a little flirting?

Here are a few things that stood out to me: 

1.       He texted AND called me to confirm if I was showing up to the café

2.       I confronted him, “why did you ask me if I married or not?”. He smiles and laughs it off saying “I asked if you were AMERICAN or not” and I said, “NOooOO, I have PROOF” and I pulled up our chat to show him, but he spun it around saying I asked him THAT

3.       When we were talking about the arranged marriage market he asked if I had a biodata (marriage resume). yes. “why are you degrading yourself like that?” to “why don’t you ask your friends?” to “meet people” I told him I met a guy off the AM market for lunch “Was this last month?” no “was it this year?” yes and then proceeds to tease me about it, “I saw you there” “oh really?” “What was I doing then?” “You were sipping on your drink” “yeah? What else?” I kept prying and he said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see”. We were both staring at each other, full on eye contact with the biggest smile on both of our faces. 

4.       I asked him about his experiences, and he brushed it off saying he was “too old” I said “no you’re not” but I’m unsure if he heard that

5.       We both shared our previous relationships and reasons why it didn’t work out. I told him my ex drove down from NYC to come see me and he immediately said, “Oh my cousin drove down too, to see a girl” and asks, “what’s his name?” I said I wasn’t going to tell him because he didn’t name his ex “okay, does his name start with the letter T?” We both pause, “yes”, I’m holding my breathe at this point “what are his initials?” “TBK” “oh I don’t know him” and I let out the biggest sigh of relief “why’d you sigh like that?” I want to him to think I AM \*available\* 

6.       When I was sharing my views on relationships, how maintaining balance outweighs the 50-50 bullshit he said, “that’s a very realistic way to put it”  

7.       We were talking about the company and my career in general, how I felt about it he said, “I see a lot of potential in you” and “If you need help/want to talk about it, let me know” even went as far as offering to be my mentor to help me with the finances. “Sure, I’ll reach out”  

8.       He also mentioned how he’s interested/invested in our company and that he wants the company to do well

9.       I shared how I didn’t want people to know me, but I wanted to know people, “you’d make for a good consultant”

10.  When we went our separate ways, he walked me to my car and opened the door for me, he had no reason to do that since he parked in the parking lot but he did that anyways.

I left him a message, “hey it was nice meeting you, lets stay in touch?” “Off course, we will hangout again soon” I left him another message a day later “hey if you’re ever around the area, drop by my office. I’ll show you around! “sure alright”

I want to see him again; I want to see him sooner rather than later. He is the sweetest slice of pie and I am absolutely smitten.

1k6kero,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k6kero/aitah_for_accidentally_waking_my_moms_bf_at_5am/,AITAH for accidentally waking my moms bf at 5AM,"AITAH or is he? After I accidentally woke him at 5AM during the week my mom’s bf says he will wake me up at 5AM on the weekend.

Throwaway account since I don’t want this drama on my main 

Okay so I’m 17F and in the UK. I go to college and do A levels which I hate (don’t think it’s relevant tbh) my parents have been divorced since I was 8. 

My mums house is very very far away from college I have to get 2 separate buses that take an hour total to get there. However I have been off college for Easter break the last 2 weeks. I was meant to go back Tuesday day but I was very unwell so I was off then and Wednesday… on Wednesday my mum picked up me and my younger brother who goes to school (14m) and is still off on the holidays from our dads, so I ended up at hers on a Wednesday night which never happens, which is when I start at 8:45 on Thursday day. 

Since I’m at my mums on the night before I start at 8:45, I planned to wake up at 5AM, since I need to get the first bus at 7:30 to get there on time and I want a couple hours and a little more to do all my hair, makeup, and spend some time with my dogs since I only can in the mornings and arrange my things. I’m undiagnosed however my Dad and some other family know and understand I definitely have ADHD and have my whole life but my dad doesn’t want me to diagnose it since he think it’ll worse my job prospects or something. So I always forget things and take a while to get ready.  

We have 2 dogs, the older dog who is 4f and the new puppy who’s 4 months old. The older dog usually sleeps in the hallway, whilst the new puppy has been sleeping in my mums room with her upstairs. I normally get my older dog from downstairs so she can lay in my bed with me for a bit in the morning since my mums bf says she isn’t allowed to sleep in rooms overnight. And recently he’s been saying the new puppy is a downstairs dog only except for when she sleeps in my mums room at night and our older one has to keep her company downstairs too during the day and then sleeps downstairs at night so they both have to say down there and it breaks my heart, the new puppy is a miniature dachshund and the older one is a jackapoo but she looks like a Jack russel and the puppy always bites her, her ears go down and she looks so sad like she wants to come up like she used to so I like spending what little time I can with her upstairs in the morning.

Anyway I got up at 5AM and felt awful. I really didn’t wanna go into college again since I still felt unwell, my throat is burning as I write this, but my mum kept going on saying I have to since the night before. When I left my room, I saw the upstairs bathroom light was on so I figured my mums bf who I’ll call Craig was getting ready for work in there so I went downstairs and the hallway was empty without the older dog sleeping in it, since they removed all the carpet and are painting or whatever. So I went into the kitchen and both the dog beds were in there and empty. I was drowsy but went to the front room door, and I didn’t open it, but I heard loads of scratching. I then instinctively opened as I knew my dog was in there and sure enough the older dog runs out to greet me.

I opened it quietly but I then hear loads of swearing, as Craig had apparently been sleeping in there with both dogs with him. I was confused since I thought he was just upstairs getting ready. The puppy then runs out after and they are both trying to lick me but I was so confused since the new puppy had been sleeping upstairs with my mum, but I had been at my dads for the past 6 days since then as family had been visiting during the Easter break. I cant remember what he said but kept swearing and saying ‘thanks a lot’ and how I woke him up. I kept saying sorry and shut the door thinking he could fall back asleep. I noticed the puppy had peed a tiny bit so I took the dogs outside and a few mins later he followed me. 

He started swearing I don’t even remember because I was tired and he’s always excessively angry and he said ‘don’t think you’re going back to bed’ but I wasn’t going to anyway? I let the puppy back in but the older dog stayed outside and the new puppy was lying against me as I sat next to the back door and stroked her, he then came and grabbed her from next to me whilst swearing and having a go at me again. He swears like an 11 year old who just learned how even though he’s in his mid 40s he just keeps saying the S and F word wherever they fit in his sentence to show he’s angry. 

He snatched the puppy from next to me and continued to make himself coffee, she immediately came back to me when he put her down and then the older dog wanted to come in. (was still outside) I let her in and she walked into the kitchen, she stood next to the kitchen door and wanted to go upstairs but he said she’s dirty and to clean her. I went into the conservatory, he shut the door with me in there and I got a towel and started cleaning her and he opened it a minute later saying ‘I’m gonna come into you on Saturday or Sunday morning whatever night you’re staying here (I go to my dads one day) and I’m going to wake you up at 5AM to see how you feel’ I asked him why he couldn’t just go back to sleep now and I tried to explain what I said here to him but he kept saying ‘bulls**t’ and swearing MORE and shouting at me. And claims he can’t fall back sleep in the morning, even though when I was 13 and used to sit on my mums bed and talk to her whilst him and her were in bed he could fall asleep with all the lights on and me talking at the top of my voice and he’d literally start snoring but like ok then. 

I think I’ve written too much I’ll try and sum it up but older dog walked into the kitchen and he shouted at me even though she did so since he had opened the door?? And then when I was done wiping her, he left with his coffee and opened the kitchen door and she tried to go upstairs and he grabbed her when she was mid stairs and carried her into the front room forcing her in there with him since he was mad at me, she had her ears down and tail between her legs she looked so sad but he forced her, I got the puppy and started walking up with her and he kept saying ‘don’t you dare’ or something and I went and put her down again and I remember him calling me ‘stupid girl’ 

As I’ve finished writing and editing this it’s 5:59AM and I don’t even have time to get ready. Honestly my throats burning still I’m exhausted I couldn’t sleep at all last night I got 2 hours sleep I can’t be dealing with him not even listening to my explanation or being understanding it was a mistake. But still is he overreacting?? Or was I genuinely wrong for opening the door and waking him up 

Side note if this makes a difference- he has a 2 year old with my mum, my half sister. She is his only kid and sleeps upstairs with my mum in their bed still so he always sleeps in the front room when he’s working but like I said, I thought he was in the upstairs bathroom getting ready but I guess someone left the light on by mistake. 

Mini update: it’s 6:54AM and I heard my dog scratching at my door. (Older dog) I opened it and literally as I did he was in front of my door and picked her up saying ‘nearly’ and went into his room and shut the door whilst holding her. I’ve never felt so pissed he literally forced her into his room with my baby sister in there who grabs and pulls her since he’s mad at me. ",1,1745471930.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False

Okay so I’m 17F and in the UK. I go to college and do A levels which I hate (don’t think it’s relevant tbh) my parents have been divorced since I was 8. 

My mums house is very very far away from college I have to get 2 separate buses that take an hour total to get there. However I have been off college for Easter break the last 2 weeks. I was meant to go back Tuesday day but I was very unwell so I was off then and Wednesday… on Wednesday my mum picked up me and my younger brother who goes to school (14m) and is still off on the holidays from our dads, so I ended up at hers on a Wednesday night which never happens. I start at 8:45 on Thursday day and usually only go from my dads since he takes me.

Since I’m at my mums on the night before I start at 8:45, I planned to wake up at 5AM, since I need to get the first bus at 7:30 to get there on time and I want a couple hours and a little more to do all my hair, makeup, and spend some time with my dogs since I only can in the mornings and arrange my things. I’m undiagnosed however my Dad and some other family know and understand I definitely have ADHD and have my whole life but my dad doesn’t want me to diagnose it since he think it’ll worse my job prospects or something. So I always forget things and take a while to get ready.  

We have 2 dogs, the older dog who is 4f and the new puppy who’s 4 months old. The older dog usually sleeps in the hallway, whilst the new puppy has been sleeping in my mums room with her upstairs. I normally get my older dog from downstairs so she can lay in my bed with me for a bit in the morning since my mums bf says she isn’t allowed to sleep in rooms overnight. And recently he’s been saying the new puppy is a downstairs dog only except for when she sleeps in my mums room at night and our older one has to keep her company downstairs too during the day and then sleeps downstairs at night so they both have to say down there and it breaks my heart, the new puppy is a miniature dachshund and the older one is a jackapoo but she looks like a Jack russel and the puppy always bites her, her ears go down and she looks so sad like she wants to come up like she used to so I like spending what little time I can with her upstairs in the morning.

Anyway I got up at 5AM and felt awful. I really didn’t wanna go into college again since I still felt unwell, my throat is burning as I write this, but my mum kept going on saying I have to since the night before. When I left my room, I saw the upstairs bathroom light was on so I figured my mums bf who I’ll call Craig was getting ready for work in there so I went downstairs and the hallway was empty without the older dog sleeping in it, since they removed all the carpet and are painting or whatever. So I went into the kitchen and both the dog beds were in there and empty. I was drowsy but went to the front room door, and I didn’t open it, but I heard loads of scratching. I then instinctively opened as I knew my dog was in there and sure enough the older dog runs out to greet me.

I opened it quietly but I then hear loads of swearing, as Craig had apparently been sleeping in there with both dogs with him. I was confused since I thought he was just upstairs getting ready. The puppy then runs out after and they are both trying to lick me but I was so confused since the new puppy had been sleeping upstairs with my mum, but I had been at my dads for the past 6 days since then as family had been visiting during the Easter break. I cant remember what he said but kept swearing and saying ‘thanks a lot’ and how I woke him up. I kept saying sorry and shut the door thinking he could fall back asleep. I noticed the puppy had peed a tiny bit so I took the dogs outside and a few mins later he followed me. 

He started swearing I don’t even remember because I was tired and he’s always excessively angry and he said ‘don’t think you’re going back to bed’ but I wasn’t going to anyway? I let the puppy back in but the older dog stayed outside and the new puppy was lying against me as I sat next to the back door and stroked her, he then came and grabbed her from next to me whilst swearing and having a go at me again. He swears like an 11 year old who just learned how even though he’s in his mid 40s he just keeps saying the S and F word wherever they fit in his sentence to show he’s angry. 

He snatched the puppy from next to me and continued to make himself coffee, she immediately came back to me when he put her down and then the older dog wanted to come in. (was still outside) I let her in and she walked into the kitchen, she stood next to the kitchen door and wanted to go upstairs but he said she’s dirty and to clean her. I went into the conservatory, he shut the door with me in there and I got a towel and started cleaning her and he opened it a minute later saying ‘I’m gonna come into you on Saturday or Sunday morning whatever night you’re staying here (I go to my dads one day) and I’m going to wake you up at 5AM to see how you feel’ I asked him why he couldn’t just go back to sleep now and I tried to explain what I said here to him but he kept saying ‘bulls**t’ and swearing MORE and shouting at me. And claims he can’t fall back sleep in the morning, even though when I was 13 and used to sit on my mums bed and talk to her whilst him and her were in bed he could fall asleep with all the lights on and me talking at the top of my voice and he’d literally start snoring but like ok then. 

I think I’ve written too much I’ll try and sum it up but older dog walked into the kitchen and he shouted at me even though she did so since he had opened the door?? And then when I was done wiping her, he left with his coffee and opened the kitchen door and she tried to go upstairs and he grabbed her when she was mid stairs and carried her into the front room forcing her in there with him since he was mad at me, she had her ears down and tail between her legs she looked so sad but he forced her, I got the puppy and started walking up with her and he kept saying ‘don’t you dare’ or something and I went and put her down again and I remember him calling me ‘stupid girl’ 

As I’ve finished writing and editing this it’s 5:59AM and I don’t even have time to get ready. Honestly my throats burning still I’m exhausted I couldn’t sleep at all last night I got 2 hours sleep I can’t be dealing with him not even listening to my explanation or being understanding it was a mistake. But still is he overreacting?? Or was I genuinely wrong for opening the door and waking him up 

Side note if this makes a difference- he has a 2 year old with my mum, my half sister. She is his only kid and sleeps upstairs with my mum in their bed still so he always sleeps in the front room when he’s working but like I said, I thought he was in the upstairs bathroom getting ready but I guess someone left the light on by mistake. 

Mini update: it’s 6:54AM and I heard my dog scratching at my door. (Older dog) I opened it and literally as I did he was in front of my door and picked her up saying ‘nearly’ and went into his room and shut the door whilst holding her. I’ve never felt so pissed he literally forced her into his room with my baby sister in there who grabs and pulls her since he’s mad at me. ",1,1745470938.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.6,False

Quireikan announces that it is demanding that all organizations which has historical artifacts from Africa in their possession. Must return those historical artifacts  to the continent of Africa, to the African people. 

It is estimated that over 7 trillion dollars in  valued historical artifacts has been stolen from the continent of Africa.

Almost all developed Nations has laws that prevents an organization or individual from being in the possession of stolen property. 

Therefore, by your own laws foreign Nations must facilitate the return of those artifacts to the continent of Africa, and to Africa's historical people. 

Those historical artifacts are National Treasures of the countries of Africa and therefore cannot be bought or sold to anyone or any organization. 

Anyone other than the country of origin in Africa that is in possession of historical artifacts from Africa is hereby in possession of stolen property; regardless of how it was acquired. And by the laws of developed Nations must be returned to Africa for its people. 

All (all) historical artifacts must be returned to the continent of Africa within the next 4 years. 

If all external African historical artifacts are not returned to the continent of Africa within the next four years then the United continent of Africa in conjunction with QUIREIKAN will organize a full ban on the export of foods from the African continent. The ban would stay  in effect for 7 years or until all artifacts are returned to the continent of Africa. 

The world cannot feed itself without the foods that they import from the of Africa. (meats, fish, goats, coffee, cocoa, provisions, and much much more foods. 

When they get hungry,  they are welcome to fly to Africa for a meal. 

All excess foods during the food export ban will be canned in Africa and distributed throughout the continent of Africa for Africans who have not yet become millionaires.

Quireikan who is managing, overseeing and implementing over 75 trillion dollars in future Economic development assets and projects. Will organize the building of safe zones complex across the continent of Africa to house and display those historical artifacts belonging to the continent and to the people of Africa. 

The continent and people of Africa will earn billions of dollars with Historical Artifacts Tourism.

Those who want to see the historical artifacts can come to the continent of Africa and enjoy viewing them. 

Jesus Christ said:
Luke 11:23 (KJV)
He that is not with me is against me...
 
Our hope is for the return of Africa's historical artifacts to be friendly and respectful. But  either way they must be returned. God bless.

My procedure is at 9:00-am.

I debated cancelling because I spent from 11:30-6:30 with my child in the ER. Didn’t have access to enough liquids or the things I wanted like broth. Kept drinking ginger ale, water, black coffee and lemonade… decided to push through. Now I’m wide awake with narcolepsy waiting on that 3:45-am alarm.

I’ve recently been dx with breast cancer. That was a surprise. I believe I’m prepared for the results tomorrow. Hoping for the best, understanding I may have waited too long. I don’t really have symptoms, so that a plus I suppose. I’m surprised by the young ages of many posting here. I’m truly beginning to absolutely believe that Covid depletes the T-cells leading to worse health outcomes.

Hoping for an easy second dose of Suprep, hoping for a successful procedure with no complications and above all hoping for the best outcome.

Jules loves Alexis as much as he loves his biological mom, perhaps because they've been together since he was only a few months old and she raised him as much as she did. She is more supportive of his half-divinity than Neeti                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

He's met him once in Solstice, and realised that he cares more about what Hephaestus thinks than he realised or wanted. Currently he does harbor a grudge against Hephaestus for not being present at the last Solstice and only now thinks he's a deadbeat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Has stereotypical older brother tendencies like disapproving of anyone she shows interest in or anyone who shows interest in her, particularly one Quincy Rockford.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Lucas is like the wind, never around for long but out of everyone, Jules never really gave him shit for it simply because he trusts Lucas to be able to care for himself. Like Gia, he bonded with Lucas over their shared crafts  but Lucas' disease only further pushed Jules' dislike for the human body and the belief that it's something that needs to be fixed. Despite Lucas being older, Jules feels like he needs to take care of him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

She helped him with the design of his bionic arm via Iris Message,  and Jules recently found some of her old automaton designs in Bunker 9.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

He is a tough mentor and has a tendency to push her when teaching her smithing and enchantment, but over time has come to care about her  Alas much as his siblings and tends to be somewhat protective over her. They are almost inseparable and constantly working on one project or the other, and she helped him build his mechanical arm. Jules gave her the *Enchantment for Dummies* book he got from Hephaestus  with his notes inside after a fight while they were buliding his arm.                                                                                                              |

She was the one who'd treated him when he came in broken and battered from his bike crash, resulting in him calling her pretty. They became friends after that, after gaining some mutual respect over eachother's intellect.  Over time this friendship grew into developing feelings that stayed unexpressed for the better part of two years until Jules found Lucy asleep next to him when he woke up after his injury in the Siege of New Argos. She confessed to him after a fight, and  Jules confessed to her in the middle of the dining pavillion a day later. They make a good couple, though they can be a terror to anyone around them from their ill-tempers and sharp tongues. |

Jules gave him a sword capable of unleashing a powerful slash of energy upon charging up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

For a long time Jules thought he had a crush on him though now he's not as sure anymore, but with Cel having saved his life and being a great weapon tester, alongside him knowing how to disarm Jules' thorns they ended up being  friends and pretty closed at that. Jules made him a pendant that points to the other half- which was held by Cel's boyfriend, Seth Westley and a bow that homes in on its targets.                                                                                  |

The two don't exactly like eachother by any means but with both of them being good at traps there's some sort of mutual respect hidden deep within. They work past their differences on occasion to work together  if the situation calls for it though the situation must be dire indeed to warrant that. They are not allowed to be on the same team in Capture the Flag for this reason.                                                                                                                                                              |

**Personality:**
----------------

Girlboss, Self-Important, Obstinate, Future War Criminal - All words that have been used to describe Jules cwith varying degrees of accuracy .

And Jules doesn't care.

It is safe to say that Jules doesn't like people, and this is something he does not care to hide either. He truly believes himself to be better than almost everyone around him, and perhaps frustratingly this arrogance is backed by being an incredibly skilled craftsman and enchanter.

Maybe it is because of this, or because of the blood of the Forge God that runs through his veins that Jules is so passionate about his craft, and on a constant quest to improve and better himself through it, as he believes that it is only by perfecting his craft that he himself can become perfect. This is perhaps why he treats his projects and automatons with more respect and care than he does most people.

Yet despite the malevolent hostility and _incredibly_ thorny exterior, the people who _have_ somehow broken through it can attest that despite what he'd want you to believe, there _is_ a heart beneath the cold bronze. There are very few people that Jules really cares about, and he is certainly not the best at showing it, not through words or touch anyways but through actions like Incredibly personal and well thought gifts and a helping hand when he thinks you're not looking.

To everyone else however, he is almost sadistic in his belligerence and a deeply misanthropic person who tends to be rather unpleasant to be around unless he believes you to be skilled, intelligent or otherwise useful. He tends to be alot less hostile to his fellow craftspeople.

**Philosophy:** A large reason behind Jules' general cynicism and dislike of people is his misanthropy. He believes that humans are imperfect, and that this imperfection needs to be ""fixed""- via metal and machines. Despite believing himself to be better than everyone around him, there is a pit of hatred within him reserved for himself, that opens whenever he is reminded of the very imperfections he abhors.

  
**Likes:**

*   **Food:** Energy Drinks, Coffee, Indian Food, Incredibly Spicy Food
    
*   **Music:** Breakcore, Hyperpop and Vocaloid. A fan of Hatsune Miku

*   **Hobby:** Smithing, Engineering and Sketching
    
*   **Media:** Vocaloid Media, Hades 1 and 2, the Legend of Zelda series, Stellaris, FromSoftware Games, the MCU

**Appearance:**
---------------

[\[Faceclaim\]](https://imgur.com/a/HaTE6dF)

**Height:** 5'3

**Weight:** 53kgs

**Hair:** Jet black and curly, almost chin length and always messy

**Eyes:** Light Brown, look Bronze in light

**Skintone:** Brown, with cool bronze undertones. Prone to breaking out but heat resistance keeps him safe most of the time. Has a collection of scars from forging and machining accidents all over.

**Physique:** His time working the Forges at Camp has left the once scrawny boy leanly muscled, even despite his innate strength but his build still doesn't betray the extent of how physically strong he truly is.

**Additional Notes:** After having lost most of his left arm during the Battle of New Argos, Jules constructed himself a new one made of bronze with help of Ailbhe. Friday helped attach it after a self-surgery gone horribly wrong.

**Attire/Aesthetic:** Jules doesn't usually bother with dressing up too much, he can usually be seen in a Camp shirt and jeans, with Forge gear like a leather apron, welding goggles, boots and gloves, etc on top.

**Voice:** Rough and strong, Jules might not fill rooms physically but he does so with his voice.

Hello! As the title says, looking for someone that can talk literally the whole night with. Can literally be about anything or if you need an ear to vent about something or just wanting a friend I’m here! 

A bit about me is, I teach, I gym almost everyday, and I like to cook! I love listening to Jazz music and I really enjoy a nice coffee conversation with music in the background. I listen to everything and I will take any options you’re willing to share and I’ll listen!

Actually finding the right words for this is more difficult than I anticipated haha. Alright! I am searching for something serious and long lasting and real! I wonder if I make a post here I get some more out of it than from dating apps 🤢😂. They are just so draining and fake lol. Oh and monogamouso ofc!
First of all I don't mind long distance relationships as long as there is a want from both of us to get together at somepoint and that's why I'm okey with anywhere!

Now, a few words to introduce myself! 
I'm Marvin, 26 and from Germany. I am a huge gaming nerd and music enthusiast, currently I am even learning how to play the guitar! These two things really keep me going. Personality wise I would say that I'm a weird combination. Funny, confident, talkative but also edgy, emotional and stuck in my own head. Some online place said I'm an an INFP so that cool!  I don't smoke or do drugs, very rarely drink. I got no pricings but I'm tattooed!
I'm also very animal friendly I used to have a dog for a long time and currently got my little cat Huby! (Yes I can share pictures for sure haha)
I am very into psychology and mental health since I recently started investing in my own and now I have a much better understanding of that topic. It is so unbelievably important.
I live a pretty stable life when it comes to work and a place to live. I have my own house with garden but it's so much room and so much work for me all alone. This house needs some life with a loving girl next to me maybe some kids and maybe a family dog haha! Also I'm not dead set on this house. I wouldn't mind selling and relocating someplace nice. Just so you know lol. I'd like to have a girl that understands and cares for me, someone I can be a mountain to hold onto for, somebody I can share my passion and love with. I love spending time together doesn't matter what! Cooking together or grocerie shopping, showering or working in the garden, watching movies or playing video games together all of it is great. I don't mind sharing pictures or face timing at all whenever you feel comfortable with that! To be a bit confident I can say that I don't look all to bad I just haven't gotten any luck yet lol. That might change today tho!
I really hate talking about myself this much and the amount of ""I"" or ""I'm"" I said is actually upsetting me lmao 😭

So hey if you are still reading and are actually interested in learning more about me then feel free to send me a message! I don't really mind your age so 18-35 sound fine by me! I answer as soon as I see it. I got some free time at the moment haha! I'm looking forward to getting to know you! And if I'm not your cup of tea maybe I am a coffee lol 😉🤔

1k6jqhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k6jqhl/i_rented_an_apartment_in_berlin_theres_a_reason/,I Rented an Apartment in Berlin. There’s a Reason It Was So Cheap.,"This isn’t a ghost story. It’s a warning. I don’t know why I’m posting this now. Maybe because I haven’t said a word in almost two years and something in me is clawing to get out.

I lived in Berlin for a while—early 2023. I’d moved there for work, and the rent was insane. So when I found an ad for a one-bedroom apartment near Prenzlauer Berg for under €500, I jumped. The landlord didn’t say much. Just handed me the keys, warned me the windows don’t open properly, and left.

It was… strange from the start. Not scary, just off. The building was cold, even in the spring. It felt empty, even though the parking lot had cars and some mailboxes had names.

I didn’t think much of it—until the second night.

5:00 PM – 6:00 PM: The Footsteps

I was working on my laptop when I heard footsteps on the stairwell. Heavy, slow, deliberate steps. At first I assumed it was a neighbor. But when I glanced through the peephole, no one was there. The steps just kept going up, then stopped.

The next evening, same thing.
Then again.
Always between 5 and 6 PM.
Always the same rhythm.
Always… no one there.

I started leaving the apartment during that hour. Sitting in the café across the street, sipping coffee I didn’t want. Pretending it was normal.

9:00 PM – The Laughter

By the fifth night, I heard kids running in the hall. Laughter, giggles, the sound of little feet slapping the floor.

Thing is: I never saw any children in the building. No strollers. No toys. No high-pitched screams in the courtyard.

The laughter bounced off the walls in weird ways. It didn’t feel happy. It felt wrong. Hollow. Like someone was mimicking what laughter should sound like.

I stopped sleeping with my lights off.

Midnight – The Screaming

She starts at midnight. Every night.

At first it sounded like a distant wail. By the time the clock hits 12:15, she’s full-on screaming. Raw, primal, endless pain. Like her throat should be torn to shreds.

I tried calling the police once. They came. Knocked on my door. I let them in, desperate for someone else to hear it.
But the moment they stepped inside... silence.
They gave me a weird look. Said I might be “adjusting poorly to the city” and left.

As soon as they were gone, the screaming came back—louder than ever.

1:00 AM – The Screens

I was scrolling on my phone in bed when the screen glitched. Flickered. Then static.

Then a face.

Not an image. Not a video. A face watching me.

Pale. Hollow eyes like bottomless pits. Mouth wide open in a soundless scream.

I threw the phone across the room. My TV turned on by itself—same static. Same face.

If you keep watching her, something happens. You feel her. Like she’s inside the room. Watching from behind your eyes.

I stopped using electronics after 12:30. I taped black cloth over the TV and locked my phone in a drawer.

2:00 AM – The Woman in White

She drags herself down the halls.
Covered in blood, wearing a tattered white dress.
You can hear her feet scraping.
If you peek through the peephole, you’ll see her stop at random doors.

One night, she stopped at mine.
Stood there. Breathing.
I held my breath, pressed against the wall, convinced if I moved, I’d die.

She eventually walked away.

But the blood she left behind on the floor never dried. It stayed fresh. Sticky.

The building’s janitor didn’t seem to notice. I asked him once if he cleaned the third floor.
He just blinked at me like I was speaking another language.

2:30 AM – The Car

It arrives like clockwork.

A black car pulls into the lot. No license plate. Windows tinted black.
The car looks… decayed. Like it clawed its way out of the dirt.

It sits there. Then the alarms start.

First the black car’s. Then all the others.
They don’t stop.
They scream together, like they’re alive.

And when I looked out the window once, I swear I saw someone in the driver’s seat.

Not someone—something.

3:00 – 5:00 AM – The Crying

By this point, I wasn’t sleeping anymore.

The crying starts low. A woman’s sobs echoing through the pipes, the floorboards, the walls. You feel it in your bones.

I stepped out on the balcony once. I don’t know why. Morbid curiosity, I guess.

She was standing there.
On the opposite balcony. Still. Broken. Staring at nothing.
And then… she turned around.

Her face—

I can’t describe it.

Distorted. Bloody. Black tears streaming from empty sockets. Her mouth opened slowly, but no sound came out.

But I heard it. Inside my head.

Something cracked in me that night. Something final.

I left the next day. Packed what I could and got the hell out.

Never told anyone what happened. Never said goodbye. Never logged into that email again. I stayed with friends until I found a new place. I haven’t spoken a word since. Not one. I can’t.

Because if I do…
I think she’ll hear me.

They say only a handful of people are left in that building. I don’t know how.

If you’re in Berlin and see a listing for a cheap apartment on the corner of Lothringer Straße—run.

Don’t visit. Don’t contact the landlord. Don’t go inside.

Because she’s still there.

And she remembers everyone who leaves.

She misses you.

She always will.
And she’s still watching.",11,1745469440.0,nosleep,1,0.92,False

I know a lot of people (myself included) feel anxious about posting or replying online. It’s so easy to get caught in the cycle of writing a comment or a post, and then second-guessing it or just deleting it altogether. If that sounds familiar, there’s a tool I found that can help with all of this.

It automates some of the stuff you’d normally get stuck on, like replying to posts/messages or even creating your own content. The cool part is that it still lets you keep your own voice, so it doesn’t feel like you’re outsourcing your social media entirely.

**Some Features:**  
   Create posts or reply to threads

Respond to DMs automatically

You can add some subtle marketing if you need it (without it feeling spammy)

It lets you set things up so you can emphasize or avoid certain topics

Works with X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit

If you’re someone who wants to stay active online but feels like social media is a bit much sometimes, this tool could save you a ton of time and reduce that anxiety. I tried it, and it’s honestly been a game-changer in helping me feel more confident about being present online.

It’s also really affordable, around the price of a coffee, and there’s a 3-day free trial if you want to give it a shot.

Anyway, just thought I’d share in case anyone else struggles with this kind of thing! Would love to know if anyone has tried something similar or has tips for feeling more confident online",2,1745469163.0,roastmystartup,0,1.0,False

I (22, M) recently developed a massive crush on a girl in my foreign language class. She was usually quiet and never hung out with the group (we used to go as a group to the cafeteria, pubs in the evening, etc.), but we got talking and I was probably the only one she spoke to regularly. I once asked her to join us, but she said she was busy but mentioned she was in a theatre arts club and I should drop by sometime.

We started texting, and she wasn’t typical. Her responses were way more expressive than her quiet self in class, several texts at a time, which was good. But she often replied late, sometimes after several hours and over time even a whole day. 

When the class ended, I asked her out for coffee. She said yes but rescheduled once due to a project. When the date finally happened, the energy was really good. She looked amazing—I think she even wore makeup, which she usually didn’t—but I’m not sure if I complimented her (I can’t remember).

We talked about everything—school, work, family, pets, growing up… everything but nothing romantic. There was also no physical touch. The stores were closed for Easter break, so we just got coffee (I paid), walked around, and when it rained, we sat under a shade. There was space between us, and it didn’t feel natural to move closer. I think I got carried away by the conversation—I didn’t even try to make any physical move. She was just great to talk to.

I mentioned we should go running sometime and she said, “Sure, would love that.” We talked for about four hours, then it got dark and cold, so I walked her home. During the date, she mentioned several times how college’s been stressful and overwhelming (studies pharmacy). When we got to her place, I brought up running again and she said maybe not soon—she had a lot going on. We parted with a hug, same as when we met.

On my way home, I felt like shit. I felt like I played it too safe and didn’t make my intentions clear. When I got home, I messaged her about the day and suggested getting a quick dinner during the week if she had time. She said she’d let me know.

The next day, she texted to apologize saying class had been tight and that meeting up would be overwhelming. She didn’t want to keep postponing. That was it. I told her it was fine and wished her the best with school.

I just want to know—was it a bad date? I feel like she liked me more before the date. Or maybe she thought I just wanted to be friends and only realized I wanted more afterward? Was it even a date?..I feel like shit",3,1745468371.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

***Family is Hell***

*T*he rooster crows at the first spark of dawn warmly tinting my room with a bright orange hue. I rub at my eyes jumping straight from my stiff bed. Pongo jumps in tune with me, ears up, and cuddles close instinctively. I peer across my room at the window facing the forest, the edge of our property line.

All I can see is the fog. It grows thick across the land’s perimeters in a matter of a few blinks, or maybe that’s my poor vision. Right at the point where my parent’s tree stood right at the edge of the woods the fog seeped from the seams of the gapping forest, like how when blood spurts from a wound. The wind blew hard causing a few tree branches to hit my windowpane, knocking me from my stupor. Shaking my head I get out of bed, Pongo jumping off while clinging close to me.

""Come on, time to start the day,"" I whisper, sounding like I’m gargling down gravel as I pull on a fresh pair of overalls. I brush my teeth with a hurried fervor, running down the stairs as delicately as possible, trying with all my might to not wake my grandparents. Pongo's paws are only an arm's length behind me as I hop down the steps.

Reaching the kitchen floor, the cold draft goes right through my overalls. I snatch my cardigan from the coat rack, rushing out through the back door. Leaning against our house a bucket of chicken-feed sat; a red label, *All and Sundry*  plastered across it half haphazardly. I sigh, if only it was closer. With both my bony hands I tightly grip the handle as I struggle to drag it just a few feet across our property. Out of breath and it's barely dawn, Pongo barks at me excitedly wagging his fluffy tail. Through what felt like an ***hour*** I finally drag the heavy container across our property and to the chicken coops’ gate.

“Come on out guys!” I call out to the hens and our good ol’ rooster. We had Lady and Damsel, our beautiful girls, who pecked and hawed as they strutted out of their coop. Richard, the lazy bird swaggering confidently out of the coop last. I walk in, blocking Pongo from following me, sprinkling the red feed distracting them as I gather their eggs from the chickencoop. 

Finding a few and some I might have missed a few days before. I plop them in my basket, leaving the coops trying not to get pecked on my way out of the pen. I make my way back with Pongo at my heels. That’s when I hear a thunderous vroom rumble across the horizon. As if on fire the sparkly, bright red Mustang grinds against the dirt, stirring up a cloud behind its custom wheels. Rock and roll music could be heard loud and clear as it came torpedoing closer. 

I rush past the back door, setting the basket on the kitchen counter as I storm out to the front porch. I grip the banister tight as the red mustang makes a dramatic skidding stop a little too close to our home. If grandpa saw, he’d have a heart attack. Emerging came smoke, then a lanky leg dressed in black leather. His auburn mullet attached to the man’s head was a beacon in the smog. I can see why my Dad called him a bargain-bin rockstar. 

“Hey Uncle Wayne.” I murmur, waving my hand awkwardly as he takes a long drag from his *Camel* cigarette.

Jumping out from the car was a small boy, my little cousin Billy, wearing a sherpa jacket with a pair of robin blue rain boots. His dirty blond head of hair was a mess and his big brown eyes still didn’t fit his head right. His ruddy face and nervous twitching only made him look smaller as he hid behind his Dad’s lanky legs. 

Uncle Wayne throws the cigarette to the ground, grinding it into the gravel path with his snakeskin shoes. “Abbie Ray, yeah? You're taller.” He notes going for another cigarette within a blink. Confused, I stumble over my next few words.

“Uh, you haven’t seen me in over nine years so…” I look at my feet, shoulders tensing, Uncle Wayne takes a long drag leaning against his red mustang. Pretending he didn’t hear me he hops up the porch steps, entering the house as if he owned the place. Confidence seems to be his normal state of being. Billy sticks close behind him pretending to be his father’s shadow’s shadow.

“Grandma and Grandpa haven’t woken up yet.” I remark going inside straight to the kitchen. “Do you want coffee, Uncle Wayne?” 

“Nah, can’t stand the stuff. Can you make me some eggs?” He asks, dropping into the dining chair causing it to creak, straining from the sudden impact. Billy plays with the zipper of his jacket as he sits beside his Father. I nod begrudgingly, not able to hide my pursed lips as I turn around to do what he asked. Grandma always said you had to be a good hostess after all. 

Turning on the stove top while I crack the first egg against the counter top Grandma and Grandpa come down the staircase seemingly in a rush. Grandpa was ready for the morning duties, wearing his usual overalls and work boots but Grandma still wore her fluffy scarlet robe and slippers. I look between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne feeling the tension in the air burning between them like a house made of hay during the dry season.

“You dare show your face here boy.” Grandfather’s dark expression only holds contempt as he glares down at Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne took another drag, smoking in the house and ignoring Grandpa’s glare. 

“Henry! Stop, not in front of the kid.” Grandma clenches Grandpa's shoulders tensing at the sight of Billy. She hadn’t seen him just as long as me after all. She was probably itching to pinch his cheeks at this point. 

The only thing you can hear in the room is the whisking of the bowl as I prepped Uncle Wayne’s omelet. Grandpa stone cold silent under Grandma’s obvious duress, glaring at the man lounging at their kitchen table. Grandma takes her hands off his shoulder and slowly walks over to Billy, who seems to just realize he’s the center of attention. I pour the mix into the sizzling pan, my eyes flickering between them.

Grandma sits by Billy warmly smiling at him, while Grandpa in contrast loudly drops into the chair directly across from Uncle Wayne. To glare at him head on I assume. 

“Are you hungry?” Grandma asks Billy, who nods his head enthusiastically smiling, one tooth missing in the front of his wide smile. I quickly set the dishes on the table, interweaving between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne’s glare off. 

“Thank you!” Billy happily scarfed down the scrambled eggs as if it was the first thing he ate in a while. Grandma Cecil pats his back as Billy almost choke in his hurry. 

From my peripheral I could see Uncle Wayne finally putting his cigarette out as Grandpa silently dug into the unsalted scrambled eggs. The more he ground the food in his mouth, the angrier he appeared. Uncle Wayne ignored him, seemingly a skill he had perfected over time. Grandma goes to the mudroom grabbing what looks like a bag of feed from *All and Sundry Co.* She grabs Pongo’s bowl and fills the red pebble like feed to the very top, overflowing. 

“What are you doing?” I ask quickly getting up from my seat to intervene. “We have plenty of dog food left.” I put my hand on hers. Her thin brows scrunch up wrinkling into a glower firmly taking her bony wrist out of my grip. 

“You have some attitude this morning, little lady. We know the quote now don’t we, Abbie Ray? *‘Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others,’* we take these lessons to heart, hm.” Grandma Cecil’s exasperation was leaking off her as she laments. “Now off with you, get the chores done before Grandpa starts toiling.” She starts muttering off about something walking back to the table. 

I grab my plate and quickly drop to Pongo’s level so he could finish it before I dump it into the sink. Readying myself at the door I start dawdling, playing with the buttons of my coat. Pongo sits at my heels looking up at me with a floppy eared head tilt. I press my finger to my lips, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.

“Why weren’t you at David’s wake?” Grandpa's usually too loud for a house to contain voice is now unsettlingly quiet, the threat clear in his tone. I swallow my tongue, standing still, hoping to blend in with the furniture as his obvious anger simmers. Grandma’s back was turned away from me gently caressing Billy’s hair as he ate unaware of the oncoming argument.

“David and Liz wouldn’t have wanted me there.” Uncle Wayne shrugs, eating the last few bites of his omelet.

“Don’t bring your brother’s wife into this you ingrate. Blaming dead people for your actions, it's disgraceful!” Grandpa bellows out, grandma and I quickly freeze in a state of shock.

“David didn’t call you before that day, now did he?” Uncle Wayne mutters licking his fork, not able to meet Grandpa’s gaze across the table. Grandpa’s hand slams. 

*Whack!* 

The table vibrates from the impact. Grandma and Billy flinch away, Uncle Wayne blatantly ignores it, and I’m a foot closer to the door wishing I had left when I had the chance.

“David didn’t do anything for himself and you knew that, you used his kindness against him! Like how you *always* use the people around you. Bah!” Grandpa guffaws, waving his hand in the air as if that would rid him of Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne abruptly stands up from the table shoving the chair backwards with an awkward skid. The phone in his pocket rings. He goes for it, an excuse born from thin air. Maybe pure luck. He rushes past me as if hellfire was burning at his heels. He's out on the front porch clutching his phone tightly like it's his lifeline.

With the door left open in Uncle Wayne’s rush to flee and with my grandparents currently distracted, I make my exit onto the porch with Pongo. There Uncle Wayne whispered into his phone and I can’t help but stop. I quietly step closer to hear what Uncle Wayne is saying. 

“Jessica! No wait, don't hang up…please just take him for one weekend. He’s been asking for you.” I hid behind the miscellaneous tack trunk, trying my best to be sneaky while my forty pound dog was leaning against me the whole time. Hopefully he doesn’t notice his incessant wagging tail. Definitely visible. “You told me you’d see him! You promised me we’d go out as a family. He wants to see his mom—” The other line grows louder and he shrinks back from it as if his eardrums exploded from the volume change. He puts it back to his ear quickly. “Jessica! Jessica!” He repeats the woman’s name over a few times. “Fuck, fucking bitch…” He starts redialing her number putting it back to his ear. From this angle I could see his dark scowl morphing his features into something far crueler than usual calm overly confident demeanor.

“Jessica, your son has every right to see you! If you want to ignore me, fine bitc–uh hum, but don’t ignore our kid.” He grimly murmurs into the phone.  I know now he’s definitely not talking about my parents. I try to sneak onto the porch steps and out of his crosshairs as he screams into the phone once again. My self-preservation kicked in at that very moment.

Too late his dark brown eyes—a similar shade of my father’s beelines straight at me. As if a spotlight was beaming down on my shocked still form. He latches, as quick as a whip, a firm grip wrapped around my small forearm. I wince trying to shake off his painful grip.

“Think you're being sneaky?” Uncle Wayne snickers his grip tightening to a bruising degree.

“I-I’m sorry Uncle Wayne I won’t do it again! I promise I won’t eavesdrop…” I apologize quickly, feeling pain shoot up my arm in waves, getting worse with every passing second. His eyes had this dark cruel glare to them that made him look like he was on the verge of a tirade. He was trembling with unbridled rage, his phone in his other hand, raising it as if ready to strike me like a rattlesnake readying itself to bite. 

In a flash Pongo pounces, biting Uncle Wayne’s arm. Yelping, Uncle Wayne lets me go, almost falling on the wet wooden porch floor. I jump back holding my arm close, wincing in pain. Pongo stands between us getting low on his hind legs, growling and snarling, an obvious warning. Trying to gulp down my fear I try to soothe Pongo petting his soft back over and over. 

“It's okay, Pongo, I’m alright.” I plead to Pongo not wanting to cause any more trouble.

“You're like your mom…” Uncle Wayne snarls while shaking his arm, blood dribbling down from the bite. Waving his pain away as if it didn’t look like a showcase in grime and gore. Pongo bit him so deeply he might need stitches, with the way his forearm looked like my Ma’ undercooked meatloaf. “A troublemaker, just stay out of my way from here on, and keep that mongrel away from me.” Uncle Wayne grumbles a sneer flickering on his snarling face, his auburn goatee residing on his chiseled chin looks extra devilish as he storms away. Probably looking for a first aid kit with the way that bite looked. Apparently not caring if he bumps into Grandpa just as long as he’s far away from me and my ‘mongrel.’

Limping down the front porch steps and trying to shake off the pain of Uncle Wayne’s handprint throbbing on my forearm I make my way to the butcher shed on the side of our house. I pull the hood of my raincoat up, hoping to stay dry. The *All and Sundry* employees put the slop products away in our freezers—apparently it needs to be kept at a specific temperature at all times. 

Opening the shed’s wobbly oak door, it's quite quaint, aside from the massive freezer my Dad invested in a few years back. He loved the art of butchery and thought it was worth every penny, funnily enough Grandpa didn’t argue. As I walked past the butcher station I pointed ignored all the tools and the blood hook attached to the wall. With a wet shiver, I open the alien-like freezer, cold smoke comes out of it in clouds, I struggle to grab one of the many containers lined up inside. 

With a heaving, struggling breath and sore arms, I drag the large bucket across the wooden floor with a loud shriek. Leaving the shed, Pongo barks and jumps the whole time as the bucket lands in the mud with a wet *ka-thud*. 

I stop, my lungs burning, trying to catch my breath and I glare at the Barnhouse knowing it's going to take a time and half to get there. Puffing up my chest and tucking in my chin, I grip the handle tightly in my tiny fist and move with determined steps, digging deep  with each slow step in the thick mud. 

*Caw. Caw.*

I jump, my heart shoots up into my throat, and my eyes see the feathers before finding the crow just a few feet behind me. It was big, no, it was almost as big as me, and its eyes…its eyes gave a dead stare. It didn’t move or fly away, just stared. Slowly taking my eyes off it I see I had dropped the vat, its top popped open and the red slop chunks of processed goo spilled out. I fall to the ground and quickly gather as much of the feed as I can with my bare hands. 

The red slimy–texture like homemade grits as it runs through my hands, struggling to put it back into the large tub.

I drag the container, rushing to the pig’s pen connected to our main stable. Fear makes my heart beat loudly in my ears and as if on auto-pilot I turn my body around–feet dragging in the mud, to see the crow *has* moved closer. It stood above the slop that was left behind in my scramble to flee, picking at the scraps violently, tearing whole into the ground. Gobbling it down, gorging on it so viscously I could see the lumps expand down its large throat.

*Caw. Caw.*

Closing my eyes tight, not caring if I get all the feed into the trough anymore. The red slop plops, slithering out of the bucket with the consistency of sludge, similar to the casserole we ate last night. The red chunks reek of rotten fruit, finally unable to stop myself from gagging at the pungent aroma, I start to dry heave. The smell resembles old roadkill left on a street baking under the hot sun. I stare hypnotized as the pigs come rushing out towards the trough smelling their food even from within the barn.

I look away, unable to look at the pigs engorging on the red slop with an aggressive frenzy resembling a lunch hour at my grandparents’ favorite buffet. Shivering, puckering my lips I shove my nose into my collar, not able to look at their frenzied feeding for any longer. I rush inside the main Barnhouse ignoring the grotesque smell and eerie feeling of the large crow watching my every step.

Right before I close the door I grow brave enough to glance at the crow, and the moment it catches my eyes it looks back directly at me.

*Caw.*

Spewing a large chunk of red goo landing on the ground near my feet with a  *thwack*. Just right before the ugly bird flies off into the grey sky disappearing into the thick fog surrounding our perimeter. Swallowing down my bile, I slam the farmhouse door closed, the wood vibrating under my cold numb hands. Trying to calm my beating heart, I look and see Pongo happily sitting in front of me, wagging his fluffy tail without a care in the world. I laugh, not able to help feeling ridiculous, shaking off the odd occurrence. I move towards Boone’s stall. Pongo follows me close, almost falling into my shoes.

 Absentminded I grab the red hay placing it into Boone’s bucket with my rusting pitchfork. Boone’s large muscular flank turns away and his muzzle goes instinctively towards the food. The toes of his hooves skid against the stall’s straw floor. In his leisurely movements diving his muzzle straight into the bucket to chomp down on the new feed with an asmr like rhythm. I pat his head brushing my fingers into his mane before sighing, knowing I had to put his tack on him soon, I lean against the stall’s gate.

Just as I start to hum a tune I can hear grandfather’s clopping old boots, stomping their way through the barn’s front entrance. His face looks haggard, as if he’s aged another ten years since this morning. His eye bags could be classified as carry on if he ever decided to travel on a plane. Which he never would.

“Go help your grandma with the cows.” He remarks, with a jerk of his finger, as if waving me off as if I was some pest. Grandpa slowly carries Boone’s tack bellowing at the horse all while doing so. “Stupid fucking glue….”  Not wanting to get in his crosshairs I slink out of the stables and head towards the cows’ barn. A crack of a whip is heard and Boone cries out with pained whinny. Grandpa’s yelling was only drowned out by the continuous rain and my steps that distanced me from those horrible sounds.  I continue to drag the bucket of feed to the cows’ Barnhouse, leaving a deep mark in the mud. 

I do a double take, seeing dark feathers appear at the edge of my vision, turning around all while holding my breath reveals nothing but the clear field of un-toiled dirt. I gulp, unable to hold in a hiccup of relief before I turn around, taking the last few steps towards the second Barnhouse where our cattle resided. Entering inside I can already see Grandma hard at work, already milking Brie. With her back turned to me I use the last of the feed, pouring the rest of the red goo into their troughs. 

“You’re late and I’ve already done your job, girl.” Grandma mutters with disdain. Her crackly hands grabbing for the bucket full of milk gesturing for me to take it. “Make yourself useful and take this to the kitchen.” She grumbles,  getting up from the creaky stool with knees that creaked just as loudly. I nod back and forth my red curls bouncing accordingly as I struggle to lift the large bucket with my noodle arms, it sloshes with the gallon of milk.

Getting back to the house, leaving a dent in the damp dirt, since I’m unable to lift anything heavier than an overly buttered biscuit. Knocking the front door open dramatically, Uncle Wayne and Cousin Billy jump in surprise simultaneously. Eyes are as wide as comic strip characters. The kitchen table almost knocked Billy’s untouched breakfast to the floor. 

“Jesus!” Uncle Wayne exclaims loudly smacking his hand on the table with a loud bang. Billy uses the ties of his sherpa jacket to make the hood close in on his face as he burrows into his chair. 

I try to catch my breath, as I take off my muddy boots and drag the bucket into the kitchen, ignoring Uncle Wayne. I can feel his glare burning into the straps of my overalls as I put the milk into glass jugs that were lined up on our marble counters. I do so with a methodical and experienced rhythm, but now apparently we have to put the *All and Sundry* logos on our product.

“Abbie Ray, have you ever heard of manners or did your Daddy forget to teach ya’ that?” Uncle Wayne's deep voice is coated  in condescension from across the room. I freeze still as stone, sticking the last label on the final glass bottle. I gulp down my anger as I put glass jug after glass jug into the square shaped wire container. Blinking repeatedly trying to ignore Uncle Wayne's overly thin eyebrow raised in a high arch, waiting for me to take the bait. Unable to hold it in, I'm about to give a smart aleck reply right before Pongo interrupts with an excited yip. Grandma bursts in soaking wet from the rain that's suddenly starting to pour cats and dogs. 

“Betsy is far along; I think she’s due any day.” Grandma says softly out of breath and whipping her green raincoat off on the old coat rack. Hurriedly putting the wired container of milk into our large fridge I turn back awaiting Grandma’s instructions, used to doing so every night since Ma’s passing. 

“That’s great Grandma! Have you called the vet yet?” I ask while cleaning the countertop in order to start working on dinner. Whatever dinner it may be I’m just glad it's not anymore of those funeral casseroles.  

“Not yet, I’ll call in the morning to give a little update. I think we can handle most of it by ourselves when the calf comes. We’ve handled plenty alone before.” She says softly as she starts rummaging through the fridge. I can’t help but gulp down my thoughts and words, on the edge of blurting out the only reason we're fine without a vet is because Dad and Mom were here helping. But I bite my tongue.

“I can handle dinner dear, now go sit with your cousin and uncle.” She says with a dismissive hand wave before turning our old oven’s countertop on. Feeling my stomach twist uncomfortably I blurt out something before thinking it through.

“I’m actually really tired, if you don’t mind I’d rather go to bed early…” I say immediately, my wide blue eyes flickering between Grandma and Uncle Wayne who looks more pissed off by the moment. I yawn, stretching and bringing my arms up in the air with a  wide motion, Pongo follows my lead with a dramatic yawn himself. 

Grandma looks at me, her eyes trailing over my figure as if I was a runner up pig at the County Fair. I nervously fidget with the frayed edges of my overalls not wanting to look Grandma in the eyes. Grandma nods her head but I can tell she’s disappointed, I turn away, Pongo right on my heels as I head for the stairs.

I close my door and turn the lock with a soft click. Pongo jumps on my bed with not a bit of guilt on his cute face and lolling tongue, drooling a bit. I sigh, changing into my pajamas and jump into my bed and not wishing to move a muscle. Wrapping myself with a blanket I nuzzle into Pongo’s soft furry body which lay beside me in my small twin bed. I take a few deep breaths, my eyelids growing heavy as I fall into a deep sleep for once not thinking about either of my parents. 

“Get up girl!” A blink in a second of time my Grandfather’s gruff voice bellows, vibrating across my room’s thin walls. Its pitch dark outside except for the spare sparkling stars that shimmered past the thick fog.” Go feed the pigs again they already ate through their last feed time…” I catch his disgruntled mumbling at the end feeling oddly confused. Shrugging with a big yawn, Pongo already on the floor excitedly wagging his tail. I get out of bed with another big yawn not bothering to change out of my pajamas as I stumble down the stairs. Everyone was in bed but for grandpa, who was reading a book—I can’t see the title with how dim the light was, as he smoked on his pipe. He didn’t often smoke, knowing Grandma never approved.

Not wanting to dawdle, knowing Grandpa wouldn’t approve of it, I rush to put on my raincoat and boots as I walk out onto the damp front porch. The rain continued to pound on the dirt, the soothing rumbling of thunder was highlighted by the lightning in the distance. When it wasn’t here it was beautiful, but last spring proved thunderstorms to be quite dangerous. We had a willow tree a year ago that fell to the opposite side thankfully from being struck by lightning. If it went the other way it would have destroyed half the house. Grandma always said it was God’s plan. Ma and Pa said they were just thankful we were all okay. 

The cold rain pounded on my already frizzy curls as I stomped into the mud off my front porch, heading to the shed in a half-asleep state. Stepping inside the cold rackety shed I numbly opened the large freezer door, struggling to get another bucket of slop over the large gaping opening of the futuristic freezer. The humid cold fog permeates from the container seeping into my damp curls. 

*Thump* 

*Thump* 

 *Thump* 

The large container’s final thud sloshes into the wet dirt as I drag the container one hurried step at a time towards the pig’s stable. I take in a deep breath, fully awake now the cold rain is pouring hard as the rapids. Drizzling straight down on my vibrant yellow raincoat. I freeze, squinting, my eyelashes clings to thick globs of rain droplets that cloud my vision enough to make me falter in my step. 

Lightning strikes and the silhouette of a crow, not a few feet across the barren muddy field, as large as the scarecrow it looked like. I gasp the thunder loud enough to swallow my voice. I struggle to retighten my hold on the handles of the *All and Sundry* bucket as I hurry my steps to get to the door. The cold rain pounds harder and bites at my pale knuckles making my body feel numb. My eyes flicker back to where I saw the oddly large crow, but the thick darkness and slow thunder rumble didn’t give me any clear view. 

I open the doors quickly, turning the measly old light on and it flickers. My eyes trail down expecting to see sleeping pigs....instead they were huddled together in a tight circle facing away from the pen’s gate and empty trough. A cold chill seeps into my shivering bones as I try to take a silent step forward.

Lighting strikes the ground, the smell of ozone permeating the air around me as I blink to regain my vision. The light bulb pops. Thunder rumbles and the light that encases Pongo and I’s shadows disappear with the light. The pigs that huddled together, their dark silhouette’s turned slowly towards me just as if noticing my presence.

A flash of lighting cracks, thunder booms rumbling the wooden frames, the fog from the open door seeps into the Barnhouse permeating the walls. Their pig snouts move up in the air, as if taking a whiff of the food I brought in. My shivering weak grip falters, already slick with rain water, fingers fumbling at the horrid sudden sight of the lightning spotlights. Their teeth...they were flat and filed down to perfect squares. Just like a human’s smile. They all had these big disgusting grins, unanimously, stretching their fleshy faces wide.

I scream dropping the bucket of feed onto the hay floor running into the night not thinking about anything but getting away. The cold rain pelts down into my very bones as I run, my rain boots stomping into the mud making me sink with each terrified step. Pongo barks running after me cackles raised and teeth flashing at my reaction. Out of breath, the one lamppost still lit on our farm property flickered as if ready to stop working the moment I jumped onto the porch steps.

I slam the front door open swinging back loudly on its unoiled hinges all while I take off my muddy boots. Throwing my raincoat to the floor without a second thought all while I can hear grandmother’s gasp in the background. I ignore my family's silently loud judgement as I run up the stairs, slamming my bedroom door with a good thud. 

Pongo jumps onto my bed still soaking wet from the rain burrowing into the center of my twin bed. I glared at him the whole time I’m struggling to get out of my soaking wet jean overalls, which felt like they weighed over forty pounds. I jump into my bed under my slightly damp covers as if that would protect me from what I saw. My eyes wandered back towards my bedroom window to showcase the night sky. The moon was barely visible under the thick rumbling clouds that spewed bolts of lightning every few seconds.  

The rain continued to belt down and terrorize the dirt. The fog from this morning seems like a wisp to what it was now. Thick clouds greet the earth to submerge our lands without a second thought to who inhabited it. The barely visible lamp post light that held on by inkling of oil now fizzled out and died leaving our land submerged in a thick fog and nothing else. I cling to a wet and panting Pongo, his tongue lolling out as he leaned against me. Rubbing my eyes tiredly as I cling further into his soft damp fur as I try to ignore the wet dog smell. I lean down to pet Pongo’s soft muzzle just as lightning flashes and with a sleepy blink within a moment of time I see human shaped brown eyes on Pongo’s face.

However there have been some really horrible fights between us and I am looking for advice. One fight I had with him a while ago was because he met up with a female coworker for coffee and deleted the messages. However, I understand why he did because I do get extremely upset and angry. I have history of often losing control because of my anger. That day I started hitting, throwing things etc when I found out he had coffee. Calling him a cheater and even spat on him, I know I was at fault there for my reaction. He did push me after being spat on and called me b**ch.

I decided to move forward because a lot of you said I was at fault there. I tried to work on myself. However, I started noticing I started getting angry again over little things, sometimes in anger I would also hit and yell etc insulting. He would obviously argue back and insult back. He wouldn’t take it seriously because he’s strong but it happened a few times. Over arguments, I felt like I’m becoming my old self again, the angry version which I was trying to stop.

After lots of these fights I feel like he had a broking point, he took on some debt because I wanted to buy a new home which he couldn’t afford but it was my dream home. So he took a bit out but didn’t tell me and was going to pay it back once I old house sold, however it didn’t sell. He eventually told me and we worked through that. He apologized and said he was ashamed and scared to tell me.

However our arguments kept continuing I kept calling him a liar etc and just over small things reacting a bit badly. During his breaking point he wanted to call it quits because we were just fighting a lot, then I got super angry and started swearing at him, saying fuck you etc, you’re ugly anyways and then insulted his dad. But I was super angry, but the insult towards his dad hurt him a lot, he again pushed me on to the couch and said the b word again. In his defence he says I called him that first but I can’t remember. I need help, I don’t know what to do, I feel like he has disrespected me but a part of me feels like I am in the wrong. I don’t know how to talk to a therapist to deal with this situation. He still wants to make things work. But I feel like he has no respect for me if he calls me that, I don’t know if I should see a therapist or what to even do.",1,1745468248.0,AITAH,9,0.6,False
