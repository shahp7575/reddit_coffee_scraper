Why is it that making girl friends causes me SO much trouble?? Not in the sense that they're annoying obviously i just.. can't seem to do it. 
Literally ever since I started school at 4 years old, I have ALWAYS either been bullied/excluded by other girls. It was really tough. Now, I'm in my second year of college, and the girls are much, much nicer of course but I still haven't made a SINGLE woman friend. I've made a good amount of male friends but I just cannot seem to become friends with any girls. It has really been taking a toll on me because it just feels more and more like I'm helpless and unlikeable. 
My hobbies are less ""traditionally feminine"" I guess but even when I meet a girl with similar interests, they always seem so disinterested. I do have autism so I am somewhat awkward sometimes, but I'm equally as awkward with girls as I am with guys. 
Even if I do manage to get past the awkward stage and become friends with a girl, they always have a close friend or friend group that they'd rather hang out with than me so we just end up fizzling out.
Everytime I see two or three girls getting a coffee, posting together, laughing etc.  I just want to cry because I've never been able to have something like that before and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.",1,1737859226.0,notliketheothergirls,0,1.0,False

**8th September 1972**


Flames and destruction littered the area, the sounds of the dying audible through the smoke as the survivors staggered to assist those they could, or grant mercy to those they could not.


Fire rose over the camp, and this marked the first day of retribution.


#**WASHINGTON POST**

###ISRAEL HITS TARGETS IN SYRIA AND LEBANON

Across Syria and Lebanon the IDF has hit as many as 10 PLO bases following the appalling attack in Munich on their olympic team.

Casualties are unable to be estimated and the IDF has declined to comment on the reports although the government of Syria has been quoted as saying up to 200 civilians have been killed in the attacks although this is disputed by experts in Washington, who insist that the camps hit are terrorist training facilities much like the ones that trained the Munich attackers.

**16th October 1972, Rome, Italy**

Wael never saw the man who killed him.

As he walked back into his apartment block and went to check his post the shots thudded into his back at rapid speed and killed him before he even hit the ground.

A woman who had just rounded the top of the stairs screamed and ran, but the shooter was already leaving again out the front door, long gone by the time the police arrived.

###PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVE SHOT DEAD IN ROME


Wael Zwaiter, PLO representative in Rome was found shot dead in his apartment block following a call to the police after gunshots where heard that night.

The death of Zwaiter has come one month after the attacks on PLO bases in Lebanon and Syria and has shocked the people of Rome in its brutality, with some saying that ""Israel has no right to shoot people in our streets"" while others have questioned why Italy itself had not done something earlier.

The Italian Communist Party has vocally criticised the killing, stating that ""Israel had no right to execute someone in the streets of our country"" and has joined the PLO itself in categorically rejecting the premise that Wael had anything to do with the Munich attacks *or* Black September.

**8th December 1972, Paris, France**

Mahmoud left his apartment, the events of the past year weighting on his mind but as he saw his wife Marie-Claude and daughter Amina walking down the street towards him he smiled and for a moment forgot all about these things.

His daughter raced towards him to hug her father but she would never get there in time, not before a hail of bullets from a passing car cut Mahmoud down in the street, leaving his wife and child crying over his body....


#**LE MONDE**

###PLO PARIS REPRESENTATIVE KILLED IN STREETS OF PARIS

Mahmoud Hamshari, PLO representative to France, was killed in a drive-by shooting on the night of 8th December. 

Shocking nearby Parisians as well as his own wife and child who witnessed the attack, the killing has been criticsed as Parisians who have protested at the Israeli embassy on the assumption it was them who carried out the attack, with banners reading ""Our Streets Are Not Your Battlefield"".

Much like the killed of Wael Zwaiter two months ago the PLO has denied that Mahmoud had anything to do with the Munich attack and declared the killing as ""shocking and reprehensible assault on a diplomat"".

Baruch sat at the table outside Café Morrison, his meeting had not gone well but this had left him a couple of hours before he needed to report back to Tel Aviv, deciding to order a coffee and something to eat he relaxed and looked around the busy morning streets of Madrid when he noticed two men approaching him.

Baruch was fast, but not fast enough as three bullets hit him square in the chest before he could draw his own gun...

###MOSSAD ASSASSIN SHOT DEAD IN MADRID

A shooting outside a cafe is being investigated by police with reports that one armed assailant has been killed.

Named locally as Baruch Cohen, police report that they believe he was a Mossad agent and was found armed and dead at the scene, with some speculating that he was part of a plan to kill Palestinian citizens much liike in the rest of Europe.

Details are scarce including who stopped Baruch before such an attack took place and the government has so far declined to comment.

**10th April 1973, Beirut, Lebanon**


The cool clear night was silent but for a whisper, the edge of a knife.

The violence burst through the air like an explosion as gunfire and screaming could be heard around Beirut.

Doors kicked in, guns fired; men, women and children screaming tore through the city like a ripple effect of carnage.

As the Israeli forces conducted their brutal work blood and bodies littered the scene. The cacophony of violence ending in a crescendo as a multi-storey apartment block was levelled in an explosion in the centre of Beirut..

###Zionist Forces Massacre Palestinians in Lebanon

In an illegal attack by zionist troops in the early hours of the morning as many as 60 Palestinians have been confirmed as killed across three simultaneous raids on apartment blocks in the city.

In what was presumed to have been carried out in the cover of night the zionists infiltrated Beirut and shot dead martyrs such as Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, Kamal Adwan and Kamal Nasser along with 3 Lebanese police officers and at least 60 civilians in an evil massacre that ended with the detonation of a multi-storey apartment block after a protracted shoot-out.

1ia3wj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/1ia3wj6/struggling_with_uncertainty_after/,Struggling with Uncertainty After Breakup/Separation from FA Partner,"I’m seeking advice from the community on how to navigate this situation and what steps I should (and shouldn’t) take. Here’s the context:

I’m a 39M, and my partner is 38F. She’s had difficult experiences in past relationships and wasn’t treated well. Before we met two years ago, I was the first person to ever take her on a proper first date. She’s an incredible person who gives so much to others, but I struggle with anxious attachment. I know this causes me to crave more from her than she or anyone can realistically provide. She feels like she’s falling short, even though I know it’s not her fault. One note, she was an orphan from Asia that came to a first world country.

Ten days ago, I brought up a discussion from last year about blending our families (we each have two kids from previous relationships). She suggested some scenarios, but I felt abandoned in those possibilities and expressed concerns about how living further apart could make things difficult. I was looking for reassurance, but instead, I unintentionally triggered her. The next day, I apologised for my behaviour over coffee.

Last Friday, she told me she was having doubts about our relationship. She said she didn’t think she could give me everything I deserve or want and mentioned fears about being a stepmum or a housewife—roles I never asked her to take on. She’s incredibly talented and has a unique career that I love supporting. I think she might have misinterpreted my needs, but she felt overwhelmed and asked for space.

We spoke again last Sunday, and she brought up the idea that I might be better off with someone else who could meet all my needs. I tried to express that I don’t expect perfection from her, but she said she couldn’t process any more and needed to be alone. When we met on Wednesday, she dropped off my things but when I asked if she still loved me and could look at the great relationship over 18 months, she did state she still loved me and that this was the best relationship she’s ever had. However, she’s now questioning whether marriage or relationships are right for her at all. This hit me hard because I truly believe she’s an amazing person worth fighting for. She sees my needs as something someone else could fulfill, but I know I need to work on myself as this pattern has repeated in my life.

She finally agreed to try counseling, but it was clear she’s not optimistic. I positioned it as just an hour to start with and at the very least she will maybe learn something to take forward for her life. I’ve booked an appointment for this coming Friday and emailed her to let her know (without putting pressure on her to attend). My psychologist has told me to focus on giving her the space she’s asked for and to stop trying to be the “perfect” partner. I know to the non AA but this was Friday evening so less than 48 hours ago, for me this is a lifetime.

Here’s what’s confusing me: I’ve heard from mutual contacts that she seems fine. She will focus on channeling her energy into cleaning, sleeping, working out, and staying busy rather than socializing or other more outward things. Her friend mentioned that we might have different visions of the future, which feels like it goes back to the original issue about blending families—something I thought we could work through with time and compromise. Her dad, who lives with her, is also a big influence. He’s been leaning on her heavily since his wife passed away, which adds extra strain. Her dad and family aren't sentimental and I did notice she wasn't mourning her mum when we met, a month after she died. This wasn't a rebound as she had tried other forms of speed dating etc before.

She’s taken steps to create distance, like removing herself from our shared Apple account and disconnecting her car from my account. I don’t know if this is her dad’s influence or her decision.

I feel completely lost. I haven’t heard from her since Wednesday, and I’m unsure whether to assume silence means the counselling session isn’t happening or if she needs more time. Her kids are returning to their dad today, so she’ll have more time to reflect this week.

What should I do (or not do) in this situation? How do I respect her space while working on myself and showing her I’m serious about growing? Is this worth fighting for, and how do I keep hope alive without overwhelming her? Should I wait until Wednesday to confirm the counselling session or assume her silence is the answer?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—this has been the most meaningful relationship of my life, and I want to handle this the right way.",1,1737859083.0,attachment_theory,0,1.0,False

1ia3uxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1ia3uxj/huge_turnaround_in_symptoms/,Huge turnaround in symptoms,"Tl;Dr I seem to have made a huge turnaround in my long Covid by sunbathing, Wim Hof breathing and turmeric tea.

This will be a long one, so bear with me.

A little background story, I'm a Dutch guy living in Vietnam. My wife is Vietnamese. 
I moved here about 7 years ago and we've been busy. During the Covid pandemic I traveled for work a lot between Vietnam and Korea. I got lucky to have missed the first peaks everywhere, but did get locked out of Vietnam and had to go back to Holland for a while. 
I never got Covid during this time. And when I finally was able to get back to Vietnam in November 2020 we started building our dream house we'd been preparing for. We built it all ourselves, the biggest project of my life at the time.
We finished it just in time for the lockdowns and got to spend that time developing our garden, as we wanted to sustain ourselves with it. 
We quickly realized 500m² is by far not enough for that. So we made the hard decision to sell it and start over on a bigger piece of land further into the middle of nowhere. 
Before we could do that I had to visit Holland again for family and paperwork. This was also the last time I got to visit my grandpa who whose health condition (not Covid related) was getting worse. 
When I visited he started to have a light cough and was tested for Covid, but I didn't think much of it because he was heavily vaccinated and I had my shots too (Chinese vaccine) and I was in very good health and strong, so I didn't care and visited my grandpa anyway. 
Turns out he had Covid and infected me too. He healed quickly and I had light symptoms, mainly coughing and a day of fever. 
I recovered and traveled back to Vietnam and started the next part of our life to build up a new house and develop a hectare of land into food forest. This was March 2022.
Over the next few years I developed many weird symptoms, had many stress related illnesses like hives and burnout symptoms. 
I was always tired. Initially we thought it had to do with all the work I'd been doing. But no amount of rest seemed enough. 
I'd feel strong and do some light jobs around the house and the next day I was completely out of it. No energy, depressed. 
Because of this I started to do a lot of work inside, on the computer. It wouldn't exhaust me as much, but might have made things worse because of the lack of sunlight (it'll make sense later on).
After my first infection with Covid I had two more suspected infections. It was either that or the flu, but I didn't get it tested. The last one was three weeks ago and every symptom I had before just went into overdrive. Added to that I started getting dizzy to the point of almost fainting. 
I had some checks done in the hospital a few times over the years, but that never amounted to anything. The doctors were just guessing stress was the cause of it all, but it didn't sit right with me. I felt lost, didn't recognize myself at all and got very frustrated. Nothing seemed to help. 

After the last infection three weeks ago (either Covid or flu, I had fever and a lot of coughing, I'm still coughing up some stuff from my lungs on occasion) I stumbled across long Covid and a few things clicked. I started researching a lot online and everything seemed to match. 

Since I'd lost just about any trust in the local doctors I decided to try and research this myself and see what the ""cutting edge"" science said about this. 
YouTube is an amazing resource in this. 
This video from medcram is a must watch for every long hauler: 
https://youtu.be/JGO2qb7wZns?si=2OQJHerinvqhWFVj
They have a few more videos about it which are good to get more background. 
It's quite heavy on the medical terms, but still understandable for any layman (as I am as well)

With this information and some other bits and pieces I got together using the help of AI (another helpful tool) I put together a treatment plan for myself. This went in steps, but for about a week now I'm doing the same one and the change is unbelievable. My stool even turned healthy after being loose for at least a year, maybe more. 
I'm no doctor, but all these things are grounded in science and together seem to be extremely powerful. My energy levels are off the chart, my brain fog is gone. My wife told me she almost forgot this old me existed. And this is after about a week only.

My daily treatment: 
- Before I get out of bed I do the Wim Hof breathing exercise and finish it with 20 minutes meditation. This has been proven to be anti inflammatory and helps push oxygen into cells and trains the lungs without exertion. (You'll notice intense energy right after this already)
- two cups of turmeric tea (powder mixed in warm water) also anti inflammatory, Ginger might work too.
- I try to spend as much time outside in green areas (for me that's my garden, but a park is good of course), according to the medcram video the NIR light helps the body recover, watch the video for the details. I wear thin clothes so I'm protected from uv but the infrared gets through to my whole body. 
- Quit coffee, alcohol and smoking (daily weed smoker, which in hindsight made everything worse as well, edibles are fine for me)

That's it. No medicine. All free (granted not everyone can grow turmeric in their garden)

1ia3tyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ia3tyv/library_of_demons/,Library of demons.,"They called it the Atramentum Library, though no maps marked its location. It existed as a whispered rumor among scholars and occultists—a place older than recorded history, where forbidden knowledge rested, waiting to be claimed.  

For most of my life, it had been nothing more than a myth, a tantalizing story passed from one eager seeker to the next. But then the letter arrived.  

It was written on brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, as though it had never dried. There were no pleasantries, no signature—only a single line, written in precise, angular script:  

“Come to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.”

The letter contained no address, but I knew where to go. I couldn’t explain how. The knowledge was simply there in my mind, like a memory I hadn’t known I’d forgotten.  

I left that same night, abandoning the warmth of my study for the cold, fog-drenched streets.  

The library stood at the edge of a forest, its silhouette towering against the moonless sky. It wasn’t like any building I’d ever seen—its architecture was jagged, unnatural, as though it had been carved from a single block of black stone by a hand that did not care for symmetry or reason.  

Its doors were enormous, carved with symbols I couldn’t read but felt deep in my gut—like sharp claws raking across my mind.  

As I stepped inside, the air grew cold and heavy, pressing against my skin like a damp shroud.  

The library was vast. Endless.  

The shelves stretched up into the darkness, higher than any cathedral’s ceiling. Books crammed every inch of space—some ancient, their pages crumbling with age; others sleek and pristine, their spines glowing faintly as though they were alive. The smell of paper and ink mingled with something fouler: the metallic tang of blood, the acrid scent of burnt hair.  

But it wasn’t silent.  

Whispers drifted through the air, faint but constant, like a thousand voices murmuring in languages I couldn’t understand. I stopped in my tracks, my breath catching.  

The whispers weren’t coming from the shadows. They were coming from the books.  

The first book I touched burned me.  

It was small, bound in what looked like cracked leather, its title unreadable. The moment my fingers brushed the cover, heat shot through me, searing my skin and sending a wave of nausea rolling through my stomach. I jerked my hand back, stumbling.  

The book opened itself, its pages fluttering as though caught in an invisible wind. Words began to write themselves across the parchment, black ink spreading like blood through water:  

“You are not ready.”

The book slammed shut, the force of it knocking me backward.  

I gasped, cradling my hand. The skin was unmarked, but it still throbbed as though burned.  

That was when I noticed the shadows.  

They moved between the shelves, not like people but like things crawling on too many limbs. They were slow, deliberate, and watching me.  

I pressed forward, deeper into the library, drawn by something I couldn’t name.  

The deeper I went, the stranger the books became.  

One was bound in something that looked alarmingly like human skin, its surface tattooed with symbols that seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking. when I touch it again same thing happened I burn my fingure.

Some books didn’t even have covers. They writhed on the shelves like living things, their pages curling and uncurling, whispering secrets to one another in voices too quiet to hear.  

But one book called to me.  

It sat alone on a pedestal in the center of a circular room, its cover blacker than the shadows around it. As I approached, the whispers grew louder, forming words I could almost understand.  

The title burned itself into my mind before I even opened it: The secret book of Atramentum.

I reached out, my hand trembling. The moment I touched the cover, the library changed.  

The shelves groaned, their wood twisting and splintering. The whispers turned to screams, shrill and panicked, echoing through the endless halls. The shadows surged forward, slamming into me, and I realized too late that they weren’t shadows at all.  

They were demons.  

I don’t know how I survived.  

One moment, the shadows were clawing at me, their hands tearing at my flesh, and the next, I was standing in a new room—vast, circular, and empty except for a single figure.  

It sat on a throne of bone and books, its body cloaked in tattered robes that seemed to shift and ripple like smoke. Its face was hidden, but I could feel its eyes on me, burning holes into my soul.  

It spoke without moving, its voice deep and echoing:  

“You seek knowledge, mortal. But knowledge has a price.”

I tried to speak, but my throat was dry, my voice stolen by fear.  

The figure rose, towering over me, its form impossibly large. It gestured to the secret book in my hands.  

“You have chosen the book. Now the book chooses you.” 





The pages of the secret book began to turn, faster and faster, the air around me filling with the sound of tearing flesh and breaking bones. Words I couldn’t understand burned themselves into my skin, their heat searing me to the core.  

I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the library.  


When I woke, the library was silent.  

The book lay open beside me, its pages blank and still. My body ached, my hands trembling as I tried to push myself up. Every nerve in me screamed, as if I’d been hollowed out and left raw.  

But something was wrong.  

The whispers hadn’t stopped. They were louder now, clearer, and they weren’t coming from the books anymore.  

They were coming from inside me.  

I froze, my chest tightening as I realized the truth. The Keeper’s voice echoed in my mind, calm and cold:  

“You are the book now. A vessel for knowledge. A doorway to the abyss.”

I stumbled to my feet, the whispers pressing against my soul, desperate and endless. I could feel the weight of the library itself shifting around me, its walls groaning as the shadows closed in.  

But I wasn’t afraid anymore.  

Because something else had taken root inside me—something dark, something hungry.  

I didn’t walk toward the door. I was pulled.  

The entrance to the library was different now. Where before there had been massive, carved doors, there was now only an archway of jagged stone, framing an endless void.  

And through that void, I could see the world outside.  

I stepped forward, the air crackling around me, and the whispers inside my head rose to a deafening roar. My hands burned, and when I looked down, I saw words scrawling themselves across my skin—endless, twisting lines of ink that moved and shifted like living things.  

The Keeper’s voice spoke again, soft and patient:  

“You will return to the world, but you will not leave this library. You carry it now. You are its herald, its seed. Wherever you go, the library will follow.”

I tried to resist, tried to fight it, but it was too late. The void pulled me in, and when I opened my eyes again, I was standing in my study room.

At first, I thought I had escaped.  

The familiar comfort of my bookshelves and desk greeted me, the moonlight streaming through the window. Everything looked the same as I had left it.  

But then I saw the shadows.  

They writhed along the edges of the room, moving in and out of the bookshelves, stretching toward me like hungry fingers. The air smelled of old blood and burnt hair. And when I turned to the mirror on the wall, I didn’t see my own reflection.  

I saw shelves.  

Endless shelves, stretching into darkness, their books alive and breathing. I saw myself walking those aisles, bound in shadows, and I realized the truth.  

The library wasn’t just following me.  

It was inside me. 

I didn’t leave the house for weeks. The whispers never stopped, and every night, I found myself writing—pages and pages of words I didn’t understand, scrawled in ink that bled from my fingertips.  

And then the letter came.  

It was on the same brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, and it was written in that same angular script:  

“Come to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.”  

But this time, the letter wasn’t addressed to me.  

It was addressed to my neighbor.  

I stood at my window, watching as she read it—a young woman in her twenties, her face lighting up with curiosity. She tucked the letter into her coat and glanced toward my house, her eyes meeting mine.  

I didn’t wave. I couldn’t.  

Because I knew what would happen next.  

She would go. She would enter the library. And I would feel it growing stronger.  

And when she came back, she would carry the same curse. The library wasn’t just a place—it was a hunger, spreading like a disease. And I was part of it now.  

I am the first step. The invitation. The bait.  

The library would always need new readers.  

And I would always be there to welcome them.   

Days turned into weeks, and the library’s grip on me only grew stronger.  

At first, the changes were small. Shadows lingered in the corners of my vision, even in broad daylight. I could hear the books whispering to me, their voices weaving through my thoughts like threads in a loom. Sleep became a distant memory. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw its aisles—endless, twisting, alive.  

Then, the physical changes began.  

The ink didn’t stay on my skin. It spread. Dark lines snaked up my arms and over my chest, forming symbols I couldn’t read but somehow understood. They burned when I touched them, a reminder of the knowledge now trapped inside me.  

I couldn’t leave the house anymore. Not really. Every time I stepped outside, the world felt... thinner. Like the ground beneath me wasn’t real. Like I was walking on the surface of a dream, and the library was the reality waiting to swallow me whole.  

I wasn’t a man anymore. I was a doorway.

The young woman returned three days later.  

I heard her footsteps first, slow and hesitant, echoing through the empty street. She looked different now—her face pale, her eyes wide and glassy.  

And the whispers. I could hear them coming from her too.  

She knocked on my door, her hand trembling. I didn’t want to answer. I didn’t want to face what I had done. But my body wasn’t mine anymore.  

I opened the door.  

Her gaze snapped to mine, and for a moment, she didn’t speak. Then she stepped inside, her voice barely a whisper:  

“You knew, didn’t you? You knew what it would do to me.”  

“I...” My voice faltered. There were no words I could say to make her understand.  

She raised her hands, and I saw the ink spreading across her skin, just like mine. “What happens to us now?”  

I wanted to tell her the truth. That the library wasn’t finished with us. That we were its heralds, its servants. But before I could speak, she crumpled to the floor, her body writhing as the ink consumed her.  

The library was claiming her. 

The next letter came a week later. Then another.  

I watched from my window as they were delivered to homes across the city. I recognized the hunger in their eyes as they opened them, that same curiosity that had led me to my own ruin.  

One by one, they disappeared. And one by one, they came back, changed.  

The city itself began to feel different. Shadows stretched longer than they should, twisting across the ground like living things. The air grew heavier, colder, as though the library’s presence was leaking into the world.  

And then there were the books.  

They started appearing in places they didn’t belong—on park benches, in coffee shops, on subway seats. Each one carried the same whispers, the same promises of forbidden knowledge. And every time someone touched one, I felt the library’s power surge inside me, growing stronger.   

It wasn’t just the books or the people. The city itself was changing.  

One night, I wandered the streets, trying to understand what was happening. I turned a corner and found myself standing in a place that shouldn’t exist—a street lined with shelves, stretching into the darkness. The books on those shelves glowed faintly, their titles written in a language I couldn’t read.  

I stepped closer, my heart pounding, and a voice whispered from behind me:  

“You’re spreading it.”  

I turned to see the young woman, her face now hollow and her eyes sunken. She smiled, though it was a joyless thing, her teeth sharp and stained with ink.  

“This is how it begins,” she said. “The library isn’t just a place anymore. It’s becoming... everything.”  

The realization hit me like a blow.  

The library wasn’t satisfied with taking people one by one. It was growing, consuming, expanding its reach. Soon, the whole city would become part of it and rule by the whispers of the books and the will of the Keeper.  

And I was its key.  

Every person I touched, every book I wrote, every letter I sent—all of it was spreading the library’s influence.  

I wanted to stop. I wanted to scream, to fight, to burn every book I could find. But the library wouldn’t let me.  

Because deep down, a part of me didn’t want to stop.  

The last time I saw my reflection, I didn’t recognize myself.  

My face was gone, replaced by swirling ink and shifting words. My body wasn’t flesh anymore; it was paper and shadow, hollow and endless.  

And yet, I felt... complete.  

The library had taken everything from me, but it had given me something too: purpose.  

Last night, I wrote a new letter. My hand moved on its own, scrawling the words with ink that seemed to bleed from my fingers. When it was done, I sealed it and left it on the doorstep of a man down the street.  

I don’t know his name. I don’t need to.  

He’ll find his way. They always do.  

And soon, he’ll join us.  

The library is coming.  

And nothing can stop it.  ",2,1737858846.0,creepypasta,3,1.0,False

Being a guy that has NO idea about anything structural or zoning restrictions, I'm wondering if anyone else have had thoughts.

I actually played around with gpt giving me a post for reddit based on some ideas I had but didn't want to be overly pushy with it as I'm genuinely wondering what could it become if it wasn't bought up and used as low-income-soon-to-be-unafforable living space. Here's that post:

3501 Hiawatha, an industrial property for sale in Minneapolis, but here’s the twist: there’s already a tenant—ADM Milling Company—which takes up about 45,000 square feet of the site’s ~82,000.

That leaves around 37,000 square feet of space to work with, plus outdoor areas, and it got me thinking: what could this place become?

Could it somehow blend the industrial vibe of ADM with something fresh and community-focused? Maybe a mix of spaces—a local market, a coffee shop, or something more out there? How could the silos or remaining buildings be repurposed in creative ways - climbing walls, mini solar farm, etc.?

And what about sustainability? Could solar panels on the roofs or even small wind turbines make this place more energy-efficient, benefiting both ADM and future tenants?

Could the community come together and buy this place, redevelop and dedicate the profits to schools or small community action partners?

I’m curious—how would you balance a working industrial tenant with creative redevelopment? What would you do with this site? ",2,1737858777.0,Minneapolis,0,1.0,False

>!Josh was forcefully dragged by a heavy chain, the cold metal biting into his skin as he was yanked into a dimly lit room where he found himself tightly strapped to a rigid chair. Above him, a blinding ray of light pierced through the darkness, casting an eerie glow on his unbothered face. Behind him, a brick wall adorned with graffiti stood ominously. His captor, a figure cloaked in shadows, aimed a familiar weapon at Joshua, his eyes filled with malice. The Captor proceeded to interrogate Joshua, the tension thick in the air, firing a menacing bullet every time an answer was given, regardless of its accuracy. Each bullet flying past Josh's, again and again. Just before the sixth question, a look of grim hope crossed Joshua's face, his futile attempt to prepare for the final shot. As the Captor stepped into the radiant beam of light, Joshua's initial fear morphed into profound despair as he recognized the telltale colors of purple and white. The gun discharged with a deafening bang, the impact causing Joshua to tumble backward, hitting the ground with a resounding thud. The once graffiti-covered wall now dripped with a sickeningly vibrant pink liquid, the room now marred by the ominous substance. Amongst the chaos, a black pin landed in the pink liquid next to the ultimate composer's feet, with a faint trail of smoke erupting from it.!<

Unbothered by the worries of the world, he takes a sip from his glass of wine, only to clumsily drop it. At first, him dropping the wine was fine until he heard glass shredding beneath is hammock. Attempting to rise from his cozy spot, he is suddenly buried by objects falling from above, enclosing him within a cocoon of objects. Slowly but surely, the hammock begins to sink. With determined effort, Kariya manages to free one arm and starts removing the debris. In the process, he grabs one of the objects and was about to throw it until he realizes it's a mirror reflecting him and the hammock he's pressed into as a strange red mark starts to poke out from it. Everything goes black before a large machine resembling a large paper shredder is revealed, having pink shreds of paper in it. From the top of the shredder, half of the paper hammock glides down, one that has a due date and Deadline written in red ink.!<

The ultimate twist of fate came as her doppelganger, embodying her likeness, deviously triggered the roller coaster's launch mechanism before Coco could secure her seatbelt, hurtling her into a dizzying carousel. Spiraling uncontrollably, she was then flung into a disorienting hall of mirrors, where sinister reflections of herself seemed to materialize and trap her weakened body. Attempting to fight back, she felt the effects of the poisoned candy, with blood staining her lips before succumbing to unconsciousness.

He goes back to see an angry crowd, as he steps back. The customers start throwing black pins at hanekoma's face, making him stumble back every time he is hit. He almost falls, as his shoe is launched on the other side of the counter, into the brewing machine as he grips his surroundings to stop himself. A phone is thrown at his face, he ultimately falls back. An intense blending sound is heard, before happy customers are celebrating their drinks.

With a victorious shout, she proudly hoisted the gleaming trophy high above her head, basking in the euphoria of her hard-earned success. The stage was adorned with the striking inscription ""50th Floor,"" a symbolic reminder of her ascent to greatness. However, joy turned to horror as the weight of the trophy inexplicably multiplied, slipping from her grasp and breaking the ground beneath her. Desperately struggling, she attempted to bear the burden on her shoulders, but its mass was insurmountable. Amidst the chaos, a lifeline appeared from the crowd, a rope ensnaring both Uzuki and the now-monstrous statue. The statue that held Uzuki, crashing through many floors, slowly catches fire. The Statue stopped falling, a wave of ash floating down through the broken floors. A silhouette appears writing something on the statue ""Here lies the ashes of the ultimate failure.""!<

This is my first post here because I am not sure where else to turn for some advice, and recommendations from individuals who struggle with the same disease. I am a 24 y/o F, and for the past four years I have been battling to keep my disease in remission with little or no success. I have been hospitalized 6 or 7 times in the last four years, with the worst case being a bowel obstruction. A part of my colon was almost removed twice, and I had antibiotics to recover from appendicitis twice as well. I have had an anal fistula surgery when I was younger, and I have some strictures in my GI tract from damage in the past. My ESR number has fluctuated from 7 all the way to 89 and even higher, and my calprotectin has seen the 1500+ markers.

Trying to keep this as short as possible - but at the end of 2023 I thought my fight was over when I was finally swapped to Rinvoq 15mg x3 (45mg dose) tablets per day. Rinvoq worked incredible for this past year of 2024. I was going on runs again outside, lifting heavier weights than I ever had before at the gym, enjoying green tea and the occasional coffee again (never alcohol or smoking). I was even able to re-introduce simple or blended fruits and vegetables back into my diet. I didn't feel scared anymore of eating one wrong food item and ending up back in urgent care or worse for a stay.

For some reason even though there has been no dietary changes, no alcohol, no smoking, no high fiber foods (everything you are NOT supposed to do with our disease), I am experiencing a flare up again that has been ongoing since mid december 2024, until now as I type this. My ESR number is shooting back up into the 40's again, calprotectin above 1200, and I had to go to the ER where I was prescribed prednisone and now budesonide steroids at a 40mg dosage per day. Worst of all, I had another CT scan done that shows ""a 7cm length stricture of the distal ileum and terminal ileum with acute hyperenhancement,"" and ""another 2cm length shorter segment stricture of the distal ileal loops noted slightly to the left of the midline."" I can feel these when I try going to the gym or working out and it has halted my progress for now trying to do anything high intensity.

For full context, I have failed; **Remicade, Humira, Stelara, Entyvio** (entyvio I only gave 3 months - my diet was reduced to plain rice and chicken and I felt nothing on entyvio) and **now \*potentially\* rinvoq**. At this point, I'm at a bit of a loss on what to even do. I continue to work with my doctor, and there is a potential she will want to switch me to Skyrizi soon, but we haven't discussed the CT scan results. Even then, for four years now I have been living with these strictures around my colon and they have genuinely degraded the quality of my life by so much. I like to think that this disease has made me a stronger person because of what I have had to endure, but at what point is it worth it to remove sections of my colon to improve my quality of life? Does anyone have any experience with something similar to this, failing medications, or any general advice?

I would love to get into more details of my full diet and supplement routine I was taking while Rinvoq was working amazingly, but I don't want to make this post too long. I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this far. I have been in a big mental slump recently just wondering when the pain will end and what I might be doing wrong. If anyone has any home remedies, or recommendations for the healing of the strictures as well please let me know! Thank you!! <3",3,1737857849.0,CrohnsDisease,4,1.0,False

I've decided to wait for you and believe the promise you made to me. That one day in the distant future you'll come back to me. My feelings for you have not wavered for a minute since you left. I have woken up a single morning and not missed holding the most precious thing I've ever had or will have for my entire life. I still think of that amazing cute smile you gave me when you fed the seals and the love in your eyes I saw that changed my whole perspective on life. The first time I wanted your phone to get us to food when we first met and I raised my hand and you grabbed mine ike no ones ever held me before. With a warmth and love that Ill never know again. I Know your my person, and that we are meant to be. Im sorry I met you at the wrong time and things didn't work out right away. But I saw how much you loved me and how much we meat to each other. I know your only eighteen and have a lot of life left to live and I hope you live it to the fullest and enjoy every second of it. I cant wait till you realize again that you miss and love me and decide to reach back out to me. 

There hasn't been a single moment when I haven't received a notification or call that I don't pray its from you. My heart will always ache that I hurt and lost you. But I believe in what you told me. That you love me and cant wait to love me in the future and to be in my life again. That I am your person and we met at the wrong time in your life. I told you not to tell me these things if you didn't mean them. If you weren't going to come back. I made you swear to me. And you stuck to the promise in that moment you didn't waiver you didn't lie I saw in your eyes you want to come back. Maybe not this year maybe not next but one day and that filled my heart with the sweatess relief. Knowing that you (Name), my person would come back to me. I made you promise to keep in touch and to check in with me and you have blocked me on everything. I dont know if you broke this promise to me because your scared of what we could have or if your simply needing space and time to yourself to see other people. But Im completely ok with that and I understand that you need to do this. Also that you need to live your young adult life. I told you I will always give you a home if you need it and I meant every single word of it. If you need a place and aren't ready to come back to me thats ok too. I would be thrilled to just be able to keep you safe and warm.

 I really miss you, the way you'd always wear the cutest messy bun. Or the way you would always be the best cat mom to sugar. How your cute little snort giggle would blow my world away and make me feel like the luckiest man alive to have heard it.I miss seeing the cute way your face would light up whenever your mom texted you or when I came home and you saw me. Of course I miss Lana and Sabrina, my two favorite girls who have always been perfectly perky for me and just love everything about them. Morgan who I've always loved meeting face to face and teasing. And even Stephany, which surprises me because we both know Stephany is an asshole. I miss you as a person hearing your amazing views on life and your amazing story that im so proud of you for sharing with me and letting me be apart of it. Im sure right now only two weeks after you have left you haven't thought of me very much, but there hasn't been a second of any day that I haven't prayed you'd walk that cute little sassy walk you do back into my life. 

I miss getting your nails done and sending you flowers. I miss providing for you and buying you the things that made you happy. I miss spending every single night together and feeling your warm that I do fear I may never feel again. This isnt me trying to buy you, this is how I show you just how much I care. The day after you left I got the ring that made your cute little face shine so bright with joy when you saw it at fred myers. The three blue stones and the small diamonds. You said it was way too much and told me to not get it. But you're worth it (Name), there will never be enough that I wouldn't be willing to give to you. You're my whole world and you meant everything to me and it broke my heart that I made you feel like you needed to leave. Every single day I have wanted to reach out, try to win you back and tell you that I love you. But I am trying with all my reason to respect that you blocked me and need space. I'm trying my best right now to write your cathedral out of paragraphs. And write my way back into your heart, hopefully without you burning this letter. 

    I've been up for days debating whether I should give this letter to you. Give you this ring and after every scenario and every event I could think of. The best thing I could do for you is let you come back to me in your own way on your own time. Maybe somehow I will give you this in a few years, I'm not sure. But for now all I want you to know is you've been the brightest gleaming gem in my life. You are the Lacuna of my soul. I will never love again the way the fires of hell made my heart burn for you. I love you (Name) And I will never love or be with anyone else like you. My heart Belongs to you whether you want  it or not. I would never force this love or my emotions onto you unless you wanted me. And wanted to return my love and finally be together.
    
    
    
    It's weird how I feel lonely when I am surrounded by friends. How my laughs feel empty and my smiles feel worn. How my heart feels like it hasn't beat since that day you left. I didn't know finding your person would feel like this. I didn't know that every trilla second there gone would feel like an eternity of sorrow of the greatest torment. I will never regret meeting you because I've truly never been happier in my life than the five months you were in it. I keep thinking September 13th was the day I discovered true happiness and I could finally breathe for the first time in my life. The amazing day you decided to be mine. But to feel great pleasure I didn't realize it came with this great pain. 
    
    
    
    I wanted to talk about everything. The bad, the good, and all the in-between in this letter. Because for me I wouldn't trade a second of it with father time if my life depended on it. I truly felt joy in every disagreement, every scandal, and every laugh because I spent it with you. I would give up the rest of my life just to spend another five minutes with you and pass away peacefully. I mean every word of this letter to you and it is how I truly feel. 
    
    
    
    I miss your amazing smile at the Korn concert. The great joy I saw it bring you was worth every second of overtime it took to buy those tickets. I have missed your cute little butt struggling to get in those jeans every time you changed. The way you brush your teeth in the shower. The way you acted Like I was your worst enemy when I got you up every morning. 
    
    
    
    I miss kissing you and telling you how you were my everything every morning whether you remembered it in that adorable sleepy head of yours or not. I wish I could do it if not just one more time in my life. I never knew how finding your person could feel and Even with this gaping hole in my chest I would do it all over again for you.

If you ever read this I wanted to thank you for coming into my life. I know you may think that you derailed it by us moving in and leaving but I think it just showed me how much you matter to me.

I will wait my entire life alone and die alone. Then risk missing out on even the smallest chance of you coming back and me not having waited. I know no one will ever make me fell this way again. No one will ever be mine the way you were. I miss the bite marks you'd leave on me for weeks just knowing they were there because you loved me. So thank you (Name). For giving my life a spark of joy and hope that you'll be mine again.

I understand you left because you're young and not sure if you even want a family. That you're still chasing the honeymoon phase of relationships and don't truly understand what love is yet. I wanted to let you know when I told you I loved you back that night in my bed watching JJK. I didn't say it meaninglessly. I wasn't just responding. I was at that moment deciding I wanted you for the rest of my life and my heart only belonged to you. That I would be there for you through thick and thin and be your person even if you decided one day you weren't mine. I said I love you and meant no matter what we face and what challenges we are going through we will do it together and take care of each other.

 You'll learn this in the future, I'm sure of it. You did say it'd take years for you to be ready and I'm ok waiting centuries for you. Harlequin you are worth it. Every second of being alone and even risking spending my life alone. And if you don't come back I will still love you. Because That's a promise I made to you and I will never break it. Just know there's always me who will love you and be there if you need anything.

I miss how annoyed you get when I said Sabrina Carpenter was your favorite singer. Or your cute angry face you'd get when I made a mistake and you'd be so adorable trying to act like you didnt love me. And the way you smile will and to this day always makes my day. I loved that you got your first deer and fish with my dad. And that my dad loves you and my whole family loves you and they have been devastated that you left. These are all things that I have fallen for time and time again. Just like when I took you to watch coraline. How happy that made you. I will never forget it till the day I die. How much I could see that you wanted to kiss me then and there. 

I was there for you when we found out you were pregnant and it wasn't Mine. That was really hard for me and I respected your decision on not keeping it and was there for you through it. That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life. You were a mess and I did my best and I hope you only have fond memories like me bringing you your favorite snacks and drinks and the flowers I got you. Me always being there for you and never letting you know how sad I was because you needed me and I was just so happy to be that person for you. To have you in my life. Honestly if it meant having to treat me like shit again and millions of abortions I would do all of them for you. I feel there isn't a mountain I wouldn't conquer for you. I truly and will always Love you Harlequin Knight.

(MY BFF NAME) is my best friend and my brother of eight years. He’s the only family I have and he told me  that he’s going to pursue you. That broke my heart all over again to hear from him. All I wish is if you do choose him as your life partner is he always treats you right and always makes you smile. The way I always wanted too.

    I pray every night that you will come back into my life and we can start over. I can make you fall in love with me all over again. I understand you want to live out your youth. I'm pretty young myself and also have a lot of maturing to do. But I hope when you're ready to commit to someone you think of what we have and the promise you made to me. Then come and brighten my life up Like you did all those months ago. I know what we had wasn't the longest relationship in the world but to me it will always be the most meaningful connection I will ever feel to someone.
    
    
    
    I plan to work on myself While your away. Tackle my depression and awful traits you told me about. Like my heaving stomping and the babytalk. Go to the gym everyday and get myself a house and a home. And hopefully give you a home and one day if you decide you want one a beautiful family. Because I know your going to have the most beautiful children god has ever created. I pray I'm the man helping you bring such joy into this hurtful world we live in.
    
    
    
    Ill have you your own little garden where you can grow your little weed plants, BUDs I remember you calling them. A big porch where you can relax and enjoy your mornings with a fresh cup of coffee you love to have every morning. All the room for any of the animals you want and all the room in the house for your thousands of different hobbies you wanna do. I hope that when I build this house and stay on my course. God brings you back to me and we can be happy again. Because the only thing I want you to get out of this letter (Name) is that I love you and I want to take care of you. 
    
    
    
    Even get you little adrenaline drunkie ass on motorbike. So you can feel free and come and go as you please. Always there to hand you your lucky cig. And buy you an amazing dab setup so you can smoke that stoner little heart till you die happy. I miss you (NAME) everyday, and I really want you back. I know a man shouldn't plead and beg for a woman's attention. That it normally pushes them away. Im just trying to tell you how much you meant to me, and how much Ill always care for you whether you come back to me or not. 
    
    
    
    I miss movie nights and late night drives. Seeing you try not to smile when I get your nails done. Taking you shopping for new clothes which you love. Buying you nice things because you deserve to have nice things. It breaks my heart knowing you are living in a trailer park sleeping on two wood chairs with two people, 4 cats and 2 dogs. That you told me you feel gross showering there. I wish you'd let me come take you home and give you a bed and clean shower. But I understand you chose this and its what you want right now. I hope that in the future you think of me and remember all the good times we had together that I've talked about. Even the ghost face mask that I still can't believe I did for you. I'd do it again however because you're such an amazing person (NAME).

I know I'm not perfect. I'm a mouth breather. I'm selfish at times. I get lost in depression and overthink everything. I know you hate these things about me. That I get excited about things and annoy you and that you think a lot of what I do reminds you of your dad. But I would never lay a finger on you. I love you. I would and always will keep you safe above all else. That's why I made you promise me if you didn't have a roof over your head you'd come back Even if just as a roommate. I saw how much you struggled in the last week of our relationship deciding if you should leave or not. I think there was a big chance you didn't. I'm so sorry I blew it by having a breakdown and crying my eyes out in front of you.

 I also wanted to apologize for how I viewed sex and how I dealt with it. Like you said about the flowers that you wanted me to get you flowers and not need to ask to get you flowers. That's exactly how I felt about sex. I want to have it but not have to ask for it. And I'm sorry I made such a big deal about it when near the end we kinda stopped. But I viewed it as a big connection to you and I should have made it so important to me (Name). Because if you wanted to be with me and never have sex again I would Die happy. I mean that and I'm so sorry it took you leaving for me to realize it. I hope it's not too late to have you in my life again. In having you gone it's made me realize how much growing up I also still have to do and I plan to. I will mature into a person worthy of your love, not just your attraction. 

I do feel in a relationship you didn't value the things I did for us and you asked a lot of me. I provided us with a two bedroom new apartment and I gave us food and wifi and computers and cars. I set us up to live a good life together. I thought at the time that I was doing enough for you and I think in time you'll see I did do a lot. But I see that you also tried your best. You made me food whenever you felt Like you could handle that and always did the dishes and laundry which I appreciate everything you did and I thank you to this day. I put a lot of hours into my work so we could move in together and It was too soon. We should have waited to have sex and live together. But I didn't want you living with your ex anymore with how he abused you. (NAME) I wanted to keep you safe so I did what I could to get us where I got us. I'm sorry if I also did not value the things you did because you did do a lot. 

I will never let you go (NAME) but if you decide you never want to hear from me again let me know and I will make sure you never hear from me again. I love you, thank you again for the amazing five months you spent with me. I also have your tickets if you'd like them. They were a gift and as far as I'm concerned belong to you. Ill take you if you would like. But if you go with (MY BFF NAME) or someone else I understand. 

I love you and I hope one day I can see you again and you can make me smile like you always do. I am gonna wait for you and it's my choice. If you don't want to come back to me I understand. You are the love of my life and I will always be here for you. You once told me If we were dirt poor and homeless on the side of the street that you would be ok if I was there with you and that's the exact moment I knew I loved you (NAME) and I always will. I wish you the best in your life and hope you get the perfect ending you desire. I pray you keep the promise you made to me and I can have a second chance. I love you (NAME), you are my person. And I'm always here for you.

I kept every receipt to show him that I am not overcharging or taking advantage of the situation whenever his going to pay me. A week ago I left the country to visit my parents and for job related meetings. Now he is sending me a video about the furniture ( other tv, tv stand, coffee table with matching end tables, kitchen cabinet, couch, dinner table set) without consulting me and disregarding the interior design plan that I am financing. He spent $120 (I'm being clear about it because he asked me too, he knows that I am trying getting feedback from a reddit community)
He estates that everything can be replaced later but for me that was an unnecessary purchased because I was pretty clear about not buying temporary things because it's a waste of money.

With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

1ia36cz,https://v.redd.it/8m1zltfcw8fe1,Digging… Bobby driving the RV to Vermont,"We already know she wasn’t alone driving to Vermont. You can clearly see she is riding passenger because of how close she is to the shoulder and how many shots out of the passenger side window she got. If she was driving, she wouldn’t have been able to get the angles right without leaning all the way to the passenger side of the vehicle (keep in mind she is 5’2”) she would be all over the road. Was there a time she mentioned someone (one of her friends) making the drive with her and then flying back when they got to VT??  

Not to mention how high above the road she is and no hood of a vehicle in sight. Now, the only time you actually see the dash of a vehicle, a steering wheel, the hood of a car, and a drivers side perspective out the window/windshield is the last 3 clips of the video. You can also clearly see that she is much lower to the ground AND you can see the hood of the car. Then you see the clip with the rainbow showing the stickers a uhaul would have on their dash. She also made ONE video of her driving what looked like a uhaul. But what explains the videos of her sitting in the passenger seat so high above the ground? Didn’t she say she stole Bobby’s car to get to VT? Didn’t she say she crashed a car into the side of a mountain and a tow truck came and picked it up? Can someone post this proof in the comments for future newcomers? 

We have photo evidence of her sitting in her RV with her iPad/computer on 9/20/24. Her TikTok videos show she got to VT 9/1/24 at the earliest. she posted a video of her next to a small brook with a gas station green mountain coffee cup (Vermont coffee) on 9/2/24. We have photo evidence of her RV canopy being in one of her videos while being in VT yet she still claims she didn’t even have the RV in Vermont.

It’s so hard to make sense of it all. It’s like a puzzle and we find missing pieces as time goes on or when she makes new videos contradicting herself. How on earth do people believe this whole story…",7,1737856764.0,graciethebrat,4,1.0,False

So I had an interview and made the shortlist for the second interview which is a coffee chat interview with the VP and Director of the company. It is a pretty small private debt organization and the first interview was digital and also pretty casual and it seemed that he liked me. The hiring manager also did mention that the second interview is more so to get to know me and how I would interact with him as well as the Director (who wasn't in the first interview call). I was wondering what are some ways to prepare? 

I am unsure if it'll be technical at all or even focused on my experiences but rather just a get to know each other kind of meeting andI assume the best way to prepare is to be caught on current events (Football games tomorrow) as well as their LinkedIn profiles and having questions prepared about their experience at the organization so far and even throughout there careers.

I was hoping you guys could let me know what the best way to prepare was and what to look out for. He did also give me a legal case that the company went through and I've gone through the document so I'll definitely bring that up and expressing my interest for the role should be no problem but should I be more focused on the casual conversation?",1,1737856691.0,FinancialCareers,1,1.0,False

So I’m on the dating apps and not really finding any viable options but measuring everybody compared to this guy that I really would like to be dating… I’m legally blind so about four months ago, I just straight up told him I was enjoying getting to know him better and would like to go out to dinner if he was open to that. We exchanged phone numbers… It seemed positive but after a few weeks we still hadn’t sent anything up. at this point, my divorce had only been final for six weeks… When I checked back, he said life is really busy so I need to decline, but you made my day again. 🤷 After that he had his daughter come stay with him for almost 2 weeks so I’m really wondering if it was a legit excuse, as he was away from the gym for that length of time… Or he just froze and didn’t know what to say, because he has continued to approach me and engage in conversation with me. He is 17 years older than I am and he drops in conversation that he’s older than me, though we’ve discussed his age. He asks questions about my life and things that I’m doing and remembers details and checks back with me on things. I’m really wondering if he is now interested and just not sure how to proceed due to the initial soft rejection… Because I’m legally blind I have a few people keeping an eye out as we interact at the gym several days a week. Three different people have told me that he seems very nervous before he approaches me to engage in conversation with me and has actually chickened out a few times after walking over my direction… I wouldn’t know about this unless I had some eyes on him.

I’ve talked to a few guys on dating apps and they just haven’t really panned out because they’ve either gotten perverted super quick or they just don’t measure up to this guy. I don’t want to wait around forever for something that may never be, but I can’t help but wonder if This guy has reconsidered and is trying to show interest now. I don’t want to come off desperate, but I would like to close this door for once and for all before I move on. One of my friends who was working out with me saw him walk halfway across the weight room after showering… I was still working out… He stopped halfway and turned around to leave because I was talking to another guy and then I guess he reconsidered because he came over and chatted with me a bit. He had no reason to come back in there, other than just to talk to me because he had already showered and was redressed to go home. I wish he would just circle back and say that he’s interested, but for some reason he’s not. Maybe it’s because he’s older and he’s afraid of coming off like a creep 🤷 we’ve known each other for 3 1/2 years, but I was married for about three years of that time. So that is why nothing has happened before now…

I’m not desperate to find someone, but I would like to share my life with somebody. But I just can’t let this go without knowing for sure. Do you think it would be appropriate to say look, I really appreciate your friendship and I don’t want to lose it. I don’t wanna seem too forward, but I feel like I’m getting some mixed signals from you and wanted to check back with you and see if you’d be interested in grabbing a coffee and chatting away from the gym? I want to convey that I respect his initial response if it was meant to turn me down, and that his continued niceness could be just to maintain the friendship and not make things awkward… People are just seeing things that I’m not due to my legal blindness, and I can’t help but think he is interested… this is already too long, but if you have other questions or want extra information to help you give me guidance, I am happy to provide it.",2,1737856666.0,datingoverforty,2,1.0,False

Here’s what we’re currently doing: 3 good walks a day, lots of backyard playtime, frozen treat bones (1-2 a day), weekly puppy class, and dedicated training sessions twice a day (about 15 minutes each). He also has tons of appropriate chew toys and was fully potty trained within just a few days of bringing him home at 8 weeks.

Despite all this, it’s still tough to tire him out. If he’s not being mentally stimulated or sleeping, he’s getting into mischief—jumping on our older dog, trying to eat rugs, jumping baby gates, etc.

He’s super smart, eager to learn, and picks up commands really fast. Any tips on additional ways to keep him entertained and mentally stimulated? Also, when might this crazy puppy energy start to ease up?

It happens everywhere I go- as if some terrible purpose has seized my heart, and talons sharp as the weapon of my 3d printed figure of Kobeni holding a knife to Denji has me by the ribs under a gorilla grip, a ruthless demon looming over my body like THE WORLD looms over Dio Brando's victims. I can't seem to avoid this being standing over me, no matter what I do. When the visions of futures where I meet my end flash by me, I'm awoken to make my choice as the fulcrum of the known universe. Of course, to meet my end to these visions would be cringe, so in my resolve I remain steadfast, as I sprint \*fast\* (maximizing the frequency of my triple S cup tier breasts shaking) to the convenience store, a local 7/11. Through this night running, the cars would be still yet the pavement would be all but a blur to me, if not for the estrogen having awoken my doujutsu and raising my awareness to a higher level capable of bridging time and space itself.

Finally I'm there, as I enter the convenience store I experience a moment of pure unadulterated bliss, as the cold which up until now had been passing through my vessel before and maintaining a perfect state of unfazed homostasis, the heated building was hontheless a nice change of pace. To that end I slowed mine to match that of the mortals I now walked amongst. Snagging a few protein bars (collagen, of course, aiding particularly well in the perkiness and formation of breast tissues and preventing my skin from becoming rigid and manly like a magic the gathering card) I then sauntered over to the energy drinks. Immediately I see my favorite selections- Monster Rehab peach tea, and berry lemonade. Oh my god, they even have the monster ultra pineapple energy, and everyhon knows what pineapple does! I shove several of these products into the empty berlap sack I carry, smelling feintly of coffee grounds and myself from sleeping in it on the roof of any public transport that could take me to places where furries were free to wolf out. Then it hit me, as at the corner of my eye I see something that stopped me dead in my tracks. Turning my head slowly so as to make sure this was no hallucination spawned from my sleep deprived state, I see that it was no illusion, they have Starbucks nitro cold brew, canned in the limited edition flavor of estromint. My right arm bursts forth with tremendous velocity, in my haste and lust for the beverages that stress my kidneys beyond the spirhonolactone I already take a kilogram of daily to avoid becoming an ogrehon like my mother, I forgot to open the glass door as my hand shatters the window and punctures the can I was reaching for. Of course, my flesh remains unharmed.

I ask someone to come over to the aisle, ready to fess up to my mistake. A woman walks over and evaluates the scene, already I'm mentally preparing myself for the conversation about begrudgingly assimilating her into my polycule when she asks yet first giving her the sheet of appointment hours for the interview, and for the briefest moment there was a look of annoyance which quickly made way for one of sympathy as she grabbed the nearest broom to sweep up the glass so she could start mopping. She cooed in a sweet voice, ""aww, is your hand okay sweetie? you okay, good girl? girling good? you finding everything you need?"" as I break into a cold sweat and space out from the dread and humiliation of being bullied in a convenience store, the kindness clearly brought on by my clockable features and cardiac tilt giving away that I should never pass even if I bribe my liver to let the estrogen through. I simply paid for my protein bars, coffee, and copious amounts of monster energies before escaping the confines of the building.

Finally when I made my way home I hopped into Discord, an empty VC while I processed what just happened and wondered what possibly could have compelled that woman to call me out like that, I was only buying several energy drinks late at night! ""Anyone could do that,"" I thought. But nervously I realize that a mini size blahaj which I keep with me to lend out for free use to the other girls in my polycule had also been poking out of my backpack, it must have been noticeable there in the store. As was my chest, I deduced, blaming the cold because the SSS cups would've been easily hidden otherwise. There was not time to finish these thoughts, as despite the odd hours a member of the server I'm on joined. It was my sister. ""Just the girl I've been looking for, you wouldn't happen to have a DOOM music playlist, would you? a little synth, metal, maybe EDM?"" as I pull up my phone to send her a link, and also a file of an exported NewPipe instance that would contain the same playlist in its fully adless, FLOSS glory. ""Of course you would,"" she'd already surmised before I could send it. ""Such a good girl, so helpful."" panicking further I threw my headset against the wall and jumped down the stairs- double jumping off the wall at the landing in order to redirect myself towards the window to make it out of the house quicker (normally I have people jumping \*in\* through my windows, so this is a nice way to spice things up!) while doing a 720 degree spin like Palpatine getting Sithed out as my skirt twirled like a Twi-lek dancer.

I leave to bus over to the shopping center and browse the Barne's and Noble collection of yuri manga to clear my head, and as I'm waiting at the register to checkout, ignoring the warming expression of the employee at the register I remember the cans of Discord Nitro Cold Brew that I punctured with my fingers. I checked them, still wet and slightly sticky, with dried flecks of sweet cream stuck to them- when in that moment I was taken out of my train of thought when my phone started vibrating, playing the absolute banger of Shokupan's ""2mg""... I picked up my phone to hear the voice of my girlfriend, one of the many I court. ""Tactical... ;3 o' Tic-Tac....... would a year-long supply of that trans colored monster energy make you stop shitposting? I know a girl, and it's not like that nasty Shitfucks coffee, that stuff even with estrogen is only good for being dirty water, used for machines and nothing more."" I nervously replied it wouldn't sway me, knowing this was a test and if I made the slightest error, the extended training she's had in The Way would alert her through truthsaying and I would feel her gom jabbar at my neck. I can't have her realizing that I'm a feral animal, or she'll try to give me her fursona she passes around. ""Good girl, that was the right answer. It would've been on the test, but here you are getting it right already."" and then, I woke up. My Dune alarm was ringing, it's already 3 minutes past when I generally take my estrogen and I could feel my awareness already receding as the testosterone festers in my blood and I can already begin to smell how clockable I am. Thinking of the sweet taste of guava fruit got my mouth moistened enough to dissolve the estrogen easily. Checking my phone I saw a notification from my sister... ""Hey Tic-Tac. Tactical.

Profitec Move and Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose Pro. The counter space is a little crowded for now but it'll have to do until I'm in a larger place. 

I spent today pouring approximately 6 or 7 shots until I figured out the right setting on the Eureka to get a 1:2 ratio of 16:32g in 25 seconds. Made a latte with the final shot - a little bitter, but a decent enough starting point to keep playing around with the ratio. Though it's tough to do via taste when I don't like straight espresso!

A couple of questions as I get started on this journey.

- The Move came with 3 baskets - a single, double, and triple cup. The triple cup is 21g and straight sided, and I'm guessing the double is 14g, and it's somewhat conical. Am I better off using the larger basket for doing 16-18g of coffee? The 14g basket did fit 16g of coffee.

- Should I use the single or double shot button on the Move? From looking at the settings, it seems the main difference is the pre-infusion pump time being 3 vs 5 seconds. The passive pre-infusion is 5 seconds on both, and the shot time is 25 seconds.",11,1737856136.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

TL;DR Wondering if the appearance of this scar would be considered “normal” at 46 days post op for 38 AFAB with hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (skin involvement has included hypertrophic scarring, details below)

Skin involvement re: my hEDS has been limited to hypertrophic scarring from splitting open my knee as a kid and two smaller (2”) incisions ~20 years ago from moles removed from mid back and under right breast. Too long ago to remember if this is what they looked like during healing.

Comorbid conditions include dysautonomia, fibromyalgia, small fiber neuropathy, spinal CSF leak and/or CSF Venous fistula, hemochromatosis, and periods of anemia. I bruise easily and they do take a while to go away. 

Prior surgeries include 4 laparoscopies (2010-endometriosis, 2017-endometriosis/appendectomy, 2019-gallbladder removal, 2022-partial hysterectomy and separation of bladder from uterus) and in 2024 I had a drainage of a massive perianal abscess.

My current recovery is from an intramuscular ulnar nerve transposition surgery on 12/10/24. They took out my stitches at my 2 week post op. I waited 1 month to bathe. 

The only other relevant info I can think of is that I was not told my restrictions besides not carrying anything heavier than a cup of coffee for 6 weeks. Then after I cut wrapping paper and wrapped Christmas presents, etc I was told no gripping or twisting/turning for 6 weeks. 

Had my second post op last week and was told my incision looked fine by the PA and told me to keep the restrictions for another 6 weeks.

It was only when the incision itself started to ache that I noticed this stretched out worm-like appearance of the scar. 

I didn’t get any directions for when I should start massaging the scar and when I asked about PT or OT the PA didn’t think I needed it. I pushed for OT.

I’m mainly looking for some feedback on the scar and if it looks like a typical hEDS scar/hypertrophic or if there’s something else that needs to be done. I’m sending images to my PA as well but he doesn’t seem well versed in hEDS.",2,1737855298.0,AskDocs,7,1.0,False

I wasn’t there but they started having a conversation about life and what my girl wants to do. The lady had said her and her husband own multiple businesses and were interested in marketing. With me being involved in business and interested in (proper) networking, my lady gave this lady my number. The lady never said anything about mlm or amway. I was contacted by the lady’s husband and he we exchanged a few texts and a phone call regarding networking and he explained to me how he was involved with a man named Mike Harvey and had a collection of entrepreneurs that frequently met to discuss a higher cause he never said anything about mlm or amway. I wasn’t very familiar with mlm and had never heard of amway. I met him for coffee the next day (yesterday) and he asked me a bunch of questions and we started talking about life. He then got into discussing the importance of having your spouse/ partner involved with everything that you do regarding business. I disagreed as dynamics in relationships are different, and my girl is definitely not interested in business or has an entrepreneurial spirit. He then started telling me about amway and (network marketing) which I guess is a term to rename mlm so that people don’t get the idea of mlm. I didn’t really understand where all of this was going, he sent me a video called (the rise of the entrepreneur.) which is a video of business moguls and billionaires talking good about mlm. I told him I’d meet with him again but after doing research and understanding what mlm is, I find it really sad that so many people get roped into stuff like this. It is disingenuous to promote a product that you don’t actually believe in and use psychological tactics to try to get people to understand a false reality. His whole thing was “why would you try to start your own business when you can attach yourself to an already proven model.”
I even asked him if he had made money from amway and he said he hasn’t made much but plans to replace his amway income with his software engineer income by the time he is 35.

His only goal was to get my to start my own amway shop so that he could make commission on every product I sell “eternally.”

This happened in Denver CO his name was John Cornish and his wife- Julia Cornish based out of Littleton CO. Be very wary if you come in contact with these people, they operate and try to recruit separately and most of the stuff they will tell you is a lie.

I didn’t meet the wife as she had other things going on.
They were smart people which was surprising considering they are so into “network marketing”

I learned a lot yesterday and certainly was never going to entertain his bs or set up an amway shop.

These people are scammers and do not have your best interest at heart even if it seems like it.
Their approach was odd and cult like, but I met with him just to see what was up and this is what happened.
Be careful if you get approached by people from amway or other marketing companies. You will get fucked over at the end of the day and if you fall into it, you will become an “ambassador” for these companies and be expected to go approach random people and bite at their vulnerabilities just like they tried to do.

IF YOU ARE APPROACHING BY SOMEONE AND FIND OUT THEY ARE WITH AMWAY OR ANY MLM ENTITY, RUN!

As I do more research I am finding countless stories of people that fell for this bs and lost lots of money and years of their lives due to this cult. 
If you intend on following through with AMWAY then do extensive research and find stories from those who are truly opinionated and not brainwashed. ",5,1737854837.0,amway,4,1.0,False

For the living room we are struggling on the best arrangement for sofas and TV. 

We currently have a 50” TV and a fitting stand, so hoping to keep that size, and we are wanting two, two-seater sofas. 

I will attach some photos of the room (with furniture from previous owners, not ours) and some layouts we have mocked up. 

Some thoughts: it’s just the two of us so whilst we do want two 2 seater sofas (as we already have these and the size seems to work out) most of the time it’ll just be us sat on one sofa watching the TV. So viewing angle doesn’t have to be ideal from both. 

I have been wondering about the possibility of mounting the TV onto the fireplace but I can’t help thinking it would be a little too high?

Whilst we have mocked up two coffee tables, we don’t have these yet and open to this being different. 

Any advice/recommendations much appreciated. The mock up drawings are to scale. 

Pictures: 1-4 the room with previous owner’s furniture (the TV there was 55” so a bit bigger than what we have). 5 and 6 are arrangements we are wondering about.

If she was actually driving, she would’ve had to LEAN all the way to the passenger window (and she is only 5’2”) to take a video, she would be all over the road and not able to focus on where she’s pointing the camera. Not to mention the videos of the camera facing forward on the passenger side of the vehicle would also be very hard to achieve. You can also see how high up above the road she is, and no vehicle hood in front of her meaning she was in the RV. The only time you actually see a dash, the hood of a car, the steering wheel and a drivers side perspective is the end 3 clips of the video. You can see she is much lower to the ground meaning she is in a sedan. you can also see the white hood of the car in the second to last clip of her driving (Bobby has/had a white sedan). 

Now this gets me curious. who was driving Bobby’s car while Grace was in the passenger seat of the RV? Were they towing the car for portions of the trip? Didn’t she at one point say she stole Bobby’s car to get to VT? didn’t she say she crashed a car into the side of a mountain? There is a photo of her legs and feet in the passenger seat of a car explaining she just crashed and the tow truck towed it away or something.

She also has that ONE video of her driving another taller vehicle like a van or uhaul in VT?? Not sure what that was about.

(Long post incoming, I love rambling about food, skim the headings (assuming Reddit's markdown editor works) for specific establishments and the bolded parts for specific drinks.)

## Kompass Coffee:

Went here with my friends a couple weeks ago, and thanks to ADHD meds I was able to make the questionable decision of trying both a strawberry matcha latte and a hojicha latte for lunch instead of actual food. Thanks Pharmac and taxpayers for enabling my hobbies.

**Strawberry matcha:** had this first. Was complaining to another friend (...like, 3 weeks ago?) about how I loved the concept of strawberry matcha, but all the strawberry matcha I've had has felt like drinking McDonald's syrup in mildly grassy milk - maybe I just don't like strawberry matcha? So she suggested Kompass Coffee.

...I think I just don't like strawberry matcha. The strawberry was indeed more like a preserve than McDonald's syrup, but it still felt like drinking jam mixed with milk, especially with how sweet it was. Well, still better quality than the other strawberry matcha I've had. 

I thought about what I was expecting instead, and I guess I'd like a more sour and fresh strawberry in the matcha. Like the time I tried to make a trendy Instagram reels strawberry milk, but was too lazy to blend it, so I just mashed the strawberry with chopsticks. I've got a small amount of what I think is cooking grade matcha which my family uses for baking, so maybe I should just try making it myself. Will post on the NZ home cooking subreddit if I ever get around to it.

**Hojicha latte:** the hojicha flavour was pretty nice - I could taste both a  subtle roasted flavour and savoury flavour. However, I found it to be a bit too subtle: it was really mild and milky. Felt more like drinking hojicha flavoured milk...

(Forgot the prices) 

After that, I figured that maybe I just didn't like lattes that much, and would prefer normal tea...? And with that in mind, the next week I went to

## Tsujiri

**Hojicha** (not latte, just the hojicha): Why did I just spend $10 of hard-earned taxpayer money (/j) on plain iced tea...?

Well, other than the price, the tea was decent! They brewed it in a nice little clay pot and probably used the right temperature water and everything. The strain of hojicha must either be a bit different from Mizu Bread and Kompass Coffee, or maybe the milk brings out the savoury flavour more, because this one mostly had some nice roasted notes rather than any savoury ones. Reminded me of barley tea/damaicha (Chinese)/probably genmaicha (Japanese)/IDK the name in Korean but I buy it in 1L bottles from Wang Mart. 

I personally would've left it in the pot for maybe half a minute longer for a stronger flavour, especially with how it's diluted by water and ice. But it was nice anyways, and it's probably better to err on the safe side than serve tea which might be too bitter for some people :) (Like me, I dislike bitterness LOL, can just deal with it a little more in tea.)

Conclusion: I could've made that myself and probably would have enjoyed it 5% more... you don't even need any special equipment like you do with matcha, huh?

While there, I saw an ad for their

**Cinnamon maple matcha latte:** IDK I really like the autumn vibe... waow... the drink itself was really mid though, and really really not worth $13.80. I could barely taste the matcha - it was just a slight grassiness. So it mostly tasted like the cinnamon and nutmeg and turmeric warm milk thing I make when I want a warming effect sometimes (dammit, I refuse to give in to traditional Chinese medicine but sadly it has some good ideas), except iced. The maple syrup also didn't show up as more than some sweetness... no actual maple taste. Time to head to Costco this autumn for maple syrup and make it myself I guess :|

## Slow Koi

Was hyped to go to this one! Took me a while to figure out where the shop was, but nice little corridor, wow, Auckland is pretty charming sometimes. I'll go back for the matcha some other time, but in the meanwhile, I had

**Hojicha latte w/ normal milk:** the ingredients definitely tasted high quality! The milk had a distinctive milk flavour and the sugar tasted like white sugar out of the jar instead of a sweetener. But... those flavours kind of overpowered the actual tea. So it was like drinking sugary cold milk. Kind of a weird experience. The tea was there, though, with a slight savoury hint. 

**Hojicha latte w/ oat milk:** went to the arcade in Newmarket with my sibling yesterday. On the connecting bus back, I was wanting another drink (had milk tea for lunch - fresh milk or something Jingyu oolong from Tingtea - very nice and creamy), and remembered Slow Koi was nearby.

It was my sister's first time trying hojicha. She liked it and thought it might work well in ice cream (anyone know any hojicha ice cream?). I tried to ask for no sugar this time, but it turns out the sugar is in the hojicha mix? Sad. Well, it was still tasty. This time it tasted like sugar mixed with oat milk with a faint hojicha flavour, instead of sugar mixed with cow milk. 

$7.50 normal or $8.50 iced (+80c for oat milk) was a good price for what you get IMO, the service is really quick too. 

## Closing thoughts

Isn't it sad that when you walk around to get to exciting drinks in the CBD in the middle of summer, you'll get hot and want an iced drink to cool down, even though you like the flavour of hot drinks more, but when it's winter you have absolutely no desire to walk around the slippery and grey CBD to review drinks? (Also studying full time and TAing part time is way more stressful than summer school part time and a practically part time research scholarship.)

I think I should just make my own hojicha...

Now that I think about it, there's a chance milk tastes stronger to me than it does to other people, so don't take all the ""it tastes like milk more than tea"" too seriously :) ",4,1737854385.0,aucklandeats,1,1.0,False

When this happens, sometimes I get sad/annoyed that I don’t have a partner or roommate to take things off my plate when I am really busy. Despite sleeping little the last two nights, I decided today was the day to knock everything out and I’m so glad I did. *Today was a great reminder of how much I love the freedom of doing what I want, when I want.* I had many nice moments today that I think are worth sharing. 

**Joyous interaction 1:** Went to a local K-pop store to pick up the new /r/GOT7 album. Had a nice, long conversation with the owner. Because I believe in supporting local businesses and lifting people up, I gave him advice on how to improve his online presence for growth. Somehow the conversation turned to tax return season and he told me his partner is an accountant who needs new clients.
*Equal joy exchange.*

**Joyous interaction 2:** Popped into a Korean bakery to get a mid-afternoon coffee and snack. I liked the song that was playing but couldn’t get Shazaam to recognize it. I asked the barista if he knew what it was and he eagerly pulled out his phone to show me what he was playing. When I was when I was walking away he turns to his coworkers and says something like, “guys that settles it. I have the best music taste”. 
*Equal joy exchange.*

**Joyous interaction 3:** In Lotte Mart, I was stocking up on snacks and beauty items when an older Korean woman complimented my septum piercing and called me cute. I said “고맙습니다” and she was excited/shocked I knew the formal phrase for “thank you”. 
*Equal joy exchange.*

**Joyous interaction 4:** On my way to my next destination I passed Ulta and decided to stop in to get specialty shampoo and try a new facial cleanser. I made polite chit chat with multiple salespeople but the male cashier was the best. I complimented his jewelry and he complimented my jacket. We talked about Netflix documentaries, the importance of reusable bags, and just giggled. 
*Equal joy exchange.*

**Joyous interaction 5:** My last errand of the day was getting groceries and supplies at Target. In the cold food section I was going to stock up my iced coffee, FairLife milk, and Lactaid. Right next to me was a nice couple around my age. They were wondering out loud if they should try Lactaid and FairLife because they, “heard good things but weren’t sure.” I happily interject to say that I highly recommend them both while I grabbed the milks for myself. They both were pleasantly surprised and thanked me for my eager recommendation.

The floor plan is 4 x 4 D (4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms), meaning you will have your own bed and private bathroom, however, you share the living room, kitchen, and laundry/dryer machines with 3 other people. The rent is $1209 per month excluding utilities (which comes to around <$30 per person). The apartment is fully furnished  with a fridge, washer, dryer, kitchen, bed, sofa, TV, coffee tables, and microwave.

The apartment is very nice and clean. Spacious bedroom, private bathroom, air-conditioned apartment. The apartment is on the 4th floor, conveniently close to the nice gym, yoga room, sauna room, club room (with table tennis foosball and pool table), study room, and swimming pool, all of which are on the 3rd floor.

No noise issues in the whole year. Very close to campus (<5 min walk), close to the Chauncey area including Target, Chipotle, and other grocery stores and places to get food. Literally next door to Red Wok (Chinese food). Ideal apartment location.

Can move in late May after the apartment is vacated (won't have to pay for May rent). You can move your stuff/boxes/items earlier if needed (I just need to stay until graduation is complete). Please DM me if you are interested or have questions.",1,1737853819.0,PurdueHousing,0,1.0,False

I read through a few posts asking a similar question and there were mixed responses to each. Now it's time for me to ask my own. (I made this acct. only to ask this one question)

A little background info: I live in an apartment complex and we've had the same mailman for at least 3 years (or more). Since I was ill most of that time, I only started noticing him about a year ago when I started getting out more. I work from home and I have been taking my lunch break and walking my dog around the same time his truck rolls around. I've only had a few interactions with him but he's always so nice. He always smiles or stops to greet my dog despite the incessant barking, but he gets the job done fast so there's rarely time for conversation. He's extremely attractive with this beautiful blonde hair that he usually puts in a bun. I'm guessing he's 4-5 years older than me. I get butterflies any time I see him and I haven't felt anything like it since high school (I'm 30). Even my older neighbors have commented on how decent he is.

So, what's keeping me from asking him out or leaving a note? - a lot of things. First of all, I don't want to make his day harder or his experience more awkward if he's taken/uninterested. It's also the middle of winter and he wears gloves so I can't check for a ring!

A little before the holidays, I decided to leave him a tip with a thank you card. He knocked on my door to thank me a few days after he received it, but that was it. I feel a little stuck. I want to ask him out, but I just don't want to be creepy you know?

My friend and I are playing with the idea of organizing an unsanctioned ultra race in Toronto later this year, a few weeks after the waterfront marathon. This would be the last “big race” before winter and a great way for folks to run their first ultra.

Here's what we're thinking:

* **Small race:** Capped at 40 runners (or even less).
* **Ultra Distance:** 50k and/or 50 miles.
* **Scenic Toronto Loop:** The route will be a large loop around the city, hitting running-friendly spots like the MGT, High Park, Don River Trail etc
* **Route:** We'll provide a list of checkpoints to hit a few days in advance. Runners can plan their own routes, but we'll also provide a recommended one. Think of it like an alley cat race, but for runners!
   * Checkpoints might be at partner stores (think coffee shops or running stores) where you'll scan a QR code to track your progress.
* **Aid Stations:** Every 15 km ish, offering hydration and nutrition.
* **Open Streets:** This is an unsanctioned race, so streets won't be closed
* **Low Entry Fee:** Mostly to cover costs, a nice memorabilia, post-race pizza and beers, and maybe a donation to a local organization.

What do you think of the concept? Any suggestions? Would you be interested in participating?

I’m in my 30s now and drinking for getting smashed just sounds awful. I don’t even want to get buzzed anymore. It’s just not worth it! 

I come from a western Christian background and live in an area with majority Christians and some Jewish folks in the US, and very few Muslims. There are bars and liquor stores everywhere. It’s sort of ingrained in the culture here. 

My friends drink, but I do not judge. Less so now. 

There’s actually a growing number of people where I live pushing for sober or dry areas. The demographics where I live show that younger folks under 40 do not drink like the older generations do, or did in their youth. Some of the bar owners where I live I think are a little worried about this. 

I’m hoping this catches on—one thing I like about the Muslim majority areas of the US are all of the amenities open late such as coffee shops or bakeries open late but it’s a “third space” you can congregate to at night that doesn’t revolve around alcohol. You can go out and socialize or read or hangout and don’t feel pressured to drink!

Then they fought me to be rolled since the dough only wanted to stick to my hand and not to itself. I'm not sure where I went wrong. Is Fleischmann's RapidRise yeast not quick-rising? Doubtful. Is 80 °F too warm to be considered room temperature? Technically yes but I'm pretty sure that's still a happy temperature for yeast. The final product tasted good, a little too crispy on the outside but I think that's because our oven is whack.

I just don’t know what to do about it. 

2 weeks ago exactly my husband came down with some stomach issue. He thought it was food poisoning or the flu. He was completely out of commission Sunday-Tuesday, and went back to work Wednesday, mostly bc he could just sit at his desk and rest (when he’s home it’s harder for everyone because we have 2 under 2 and they’re trying to play with him and my time is spent just trying to keep the kids quiet). I had stomach pain that Sunday but I just ignored it and it went away. Our toddler was also sick during that time and it lasted 1 day. 

That was one of the hardest weeks of my life. I know that sounds dramatic. I started Lexapro recently and we’re still trying to get the dose right and I have headaches, nausea, or feel like a zombie most days. I also manage to parent our kids, do all of the housework and cooking, and whatever else, while sick, tired, etc. If I’m truly bedridden my husband will stay home, but that’s happened only 2 days in the last 3 years. 

It was just harder than I could’ve imagined having to take care of our 2 kids all day and night by myself for almost a week, along with taking care of my husband bc he won’t get himself food or water unless I bring it to him when he was sick, and I’d say also taking care of myself but I was like a robot shell of a person just taking care of everyone’s needs. 

He was fully better in 1 week. He started eating everything again including doughnuts, ice cream, pizza, chips, coffee, etc. Today, he said his stomach feels the same as it did 2 weeks ago when he got sick. Instantly I start to panic because I can’t do it again. I hide it as best as I can but seeing him trudging around wearing 2 sweatshirts and a winter hat inside and trying to clean up the kitchen just sends me internally. Externally I’m telling him to please sit and rest, making him tea and rice for dinner. 

I don’t know where my empathy is. I’m usually overly-empathetic especially when people are sick. I make soup for my friends and family when they have anything worse than a minor cold, I like to take care of people. But my brain is just not believing my husband for some reason. I told him at 730pm to please just go to bed because I couldn’t stand to see him do anything but sleep. 

I just need help finding my empathy or figuring out how we’ll get through this again. Last week my toddler was sick again and I let him watch tv way more than usual, like 2-3 hours/day, just so I could get through the day. My infant needs to be rocked for a while in order to sleep and tv is the only tool I have to occupy my toddler long enough to let me do that.

	-Does yoga sometimes lol

-Both Korean Americans from SoCal

-Both pretty introverted and quiet, but very willing to be friends :-)

-Very clean and organized!! If we ever get messy, we both make sure to delegate our mess to our side of the room so it doesn’t bother anyone else!

-Don’t smoke, party, or drink at all

-Sleep btwn 12 am - 2 am

-Waking up depends on our classes but generally 8 am - 12 pm

-70-75F in the room

-We like the room quiet for the most part!

-No parties!

-Dorm / 1 bd triple: We will share a bunk while you get the loft bed!

-2 bd triple: We will share the double room while you get the single

I’m CharmedCynic, a 30-year-old Japanese-American woman living in Stamford, Connecticut. By day, I’m a middle school math tutor, and teaching has been such a fulfilling part of my life. I’m looking forward to continuing this journey and growing along the way.

A little about me: I’m 5'4"" with almond-shaped brown eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, and three tattoos. I love simple, meaningful moments—whether that’s sipping on a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while enjoying the city lights, or laughing over coffee and cake. I’m all about quieter moments over loud parties and deep conversations over small talk. I lean toward a balanced lifestyle and consider myself politically moderate and non-religious.

So why am I here instead of on one of those dating apps? Well, let’s be real, dating apps can feel like a cycle of disappointing first dates, awkward conversations, and empty connections. I’m looking for something more genuine than that—something real. I want to break that cycle, which is why I’m here on Reddit, where it feels like people are more authentic.

What I’m really after is old-fashioned romance. I’m talking about dates where we go out somewhere public, not just hide in someone’s living room. A true connection comes from those real-life moments, not swiping through profiles.

When I’m not working, you can find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave music, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I’m a huge fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007)—no reboots, please—and would love to find someone who’d be up for a binge-watch. My favorite films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. I love creating playlists, and my current faves include “Sunset” by The Midnight, “Summer Eyes” by Coastal, and “Miracle Love” by Lazer Club.

I value my independence but I’m also ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I’m looking for a connection that’s rooted in trust, laughter, and genuine care. Let’s create inside jokes, enjoy the little things, and have each other’s backs through it all. Those romantic, quiet moments when we lock eyes and know we’ve found something special are my favorite.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** 5’10” or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no Molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is fine
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (US/Canada preferred)
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, marriage potential, and maybe starting a family down the line

A few must-haves: You’re emotionally available, employed, stable, single, and not in contact with exes. Communication is key, and I appreciate someone who values consistency and thoughtful gestures, both big and small.

If you're kind, stable, and looking for a meaningful connection, I'd love to hear from you! Please include a photo in your message, and I’ll happily share one back if we vibe. Let’s see where this journey could take us 💕.",0,1737852684.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

1ia1rrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1ia1rrz/siren_thesis_part_23_family/,Siren Thesis. Part 23- Family,"Part of a few short stories, with the intentional purpose of exploring a group of ""branches"", or ""test sites"", that have developed a new branch of Azur Lane dedicated to fight landbased Siren forces.

Summary:

Doctor Bethencourt and Song, the wisdom cube-born girl, are preparing for a small trip to the civilian side of the island in which the Azur Lane's base resides in. The Doctor seems to have his own plans and reasons for the trip, but so does Song, which has been looking for an opportunity to get closer to some of the Kansen at the base.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1i4l50r/siren_thesis_part_22_waltz_on_azure_lanes/) \-

////

Doctor Bethencourt had spent the better part of two days running tests on the siren machines he brought with him from his facility. While accompanied by the Azur Lane personnel, doing something he enjoyed, namely showcase his creations and discoveries, it was obvious for those present that the repetitiveness of the tests had started getting to him.

Truth be told, while interacting with the personnel as well as a few of the more research oriented Kansen, he suddenly had some interesting insights on what actual -nurture against nature- would look like in a more scientific oriented scenario.

*An interesting idea for some future experiments.*

His mind had been preoccupied with such ideas that he was actually caught by surprise when one of the girls at the base came and informed him that their trip to the city had been approved and was currently being arranged.

The city in question was located on the other side of the island where Azur Lane’s base was set on, providing lodging, necessities. Such necessities being either those that would be available at a small pharmacy, as well as those that would come from going to a mall, or even from visiting a small coffee shop in order to take a break, reading the Saturday morning press, sensationalizing news and comic strips included.

The city offered more than anything a solid foundation of “normalcy” to the inhabitants of the island, including both those that belonged to some military or governmental faction that offered support to Azur Lane.

As such, the sense of normalcy only came from the fact that the city functioned pretty much the same way as an ordinary city would do so. Similar to any city with a big military base, with the exemption of how many people dressed in uniform was casually strolling the streets, as well as the not too uncommon sight of Kansen merrily going their way on attires that were more often than not, hardly proper, if one was inclined on being generous on the description or their choice of clothing.

The trip to the city was, in itself, something the Doctor had wished for Song to experience. Thus, the very next morning he had woken up the girl with the intent to visit the place. He had immediately started describing all of the possibilities of what could be found, as well as what she was meant to do in the case of an emergency or should they, for whatever reason, begin their plans much earlier than anticipated.

 

“ *<All those plans, all those warnings. And somehow the very first thing we did after waking up before the first light is to move to a city. Just to grab a pastry and some coffee?>* ” The little girl questioned, speaking in Irisean, as they were wont to do when they were alone.

“ *<Well these are not any regular pastries. Dunkerque praised these highly. It would have been a real tragedy had we not come to try these out.>* ” Doctor Bethencourt replied as he took another bite of the delish apple, viennoiserie, and sugar-cinnamon-crust concoction.

For her part, Song could only raise an eyebrow at that, it was true that the pastry was among the best she had tried since they had arrived to Azur Lane, but even if it had been the best, somehow being a better confection than those that Dunkerque usually prepared, she was certain that the purpose of their trip wasn’t focused on food and niceties.

“ *<I don’t quite understand what our purpose here is>* ” She finally said as she took a bite of her own pastry.

“ *<Well, to start a great day with some delectable baked goods and good cup of coffee, obviously>* ”

“ *<I-… you are not going to give me a straight answer about this, aren't you?>* ” The little girl narrowed her eyes as she looked at the doctor.

“ *<Not likely, no.>* ” The doctor said before taking another sip of his coffee.

This answer brought a wry smile from Foch, the only other person among those accompanying them that could fluently speak Irisean. While she hadn’t participated in the conversation, she was standing rather close to them, playing the part of a bodyguard. Knowing that there was someone else that could understand what they were speaking about made Song feel a little bit more uncomfortable than she was willing to admit. That as well as the Doctor’s subtle gesture that this particular Kansen was more than likely a spy of sorts, made her all more uncomfortable than she could bear, scheming and intrigue were the doctor’s forte, not hers. 

Feeling that their options for safe topics of conversation were reduced by this, Song decided she might as well concede and continue with whatever plan the Doctor had come up with.

With their “battle of wits” coming to an end, with Doctor Bethencourt sipping his coffee and Song begrudgingly eating her pastry with an obvious pout to her mouth, they quickly wrapped things up at that place, promptly joined by others. Among those accompanying them were a handful of Kansen as well as regular human personnel from the Azur Lane base. They got onto one of their service vehicles that had been assigned to them and made their way onto their next destination.

It didn’t take them long to reach the main destination, a shopping mall set in the middle of the civilian side of the island. The way the doctor had explained things to Song, it sounded like he intended for her to experience yet another facet of civilian life, and come to a better understanding of what the lives of the regular people were like. Somehow, he planned to achieve this sort of insight by having her come on a shopping trip, which she found highly unlikely. Then again, the Doctor had brought many unlikely plans to fruition before, as such Song was willing to at least give him the benefit of the doubt.

 

As they stood in front of the parking lot, at the entrance to the shopping mall, Song made a quick recount of those that were accompanying them. From their own “camp” those present were Doctor Bethencourt as well as Doctor Soriz, who had been mostly unseen while in Azur lane, the female scientist quickly excusing herself from any sort of “social” arrangement made by the commander or the Kansen at the base, by engaging in either work or her own choice of activities in which the Kansen and food more often than not took a big part in.

From the Saruka Empire, Azuma had joined them. After their first day at Azur Lane in which she had more than likely made her way to the Sakuran dorms, very likely in order to share her findings regarding Song, the Sakuran lady had made herself rather persistent in her presence in any sort of impromptu event in which Song had been present. Song couldn’t fault her for it, there was a certain mutual sense of comradery from both of them, with both of them having been given a life and a mission, with barely any real history to back up their existence.

Avrora, from the northern parliament had joined them too. Which was in itself somewhat of a surprise, as they had very little interaction with their faction before. Both her predictions, as well as the Doctor’s didn’t really include any real meddling from the Northern Parliament. With the faction holding a rather inclusive focus on any event, if not too self-centered perhaps. Avrora’s insistence in participating in this trip had come as a real surprise. Not that Doctor Bethencourt hadn’t anticipated such a possibility, he had very briefly displayed that amused smirk of his, showing that such events were unlikely but not wholly unexpected.

Foch, from the Reformed Iris orthodoxy, more likely than not, assigned to this trip by her superiors, either by Richelieu or Clemenceau.

And last, but not least in importance, Bismarck and Mainz, from the Reformed Iron Blood. Both accompanying them as well as functioning like bodyguards. Which then again could be said about all the Kansen present, as well as the human personnel from Azur Lane, which were more than likely some sort of special forces from their country of origin, at the very least.

All of them were wearing some sort of casual clothes, which did wonders to blend with the people in the mall, at least on a more natural sort of way, as the Kansen seemed to draw attention regardless of their choice of attire, more than likely due to their stunning looks.

“Well here we are,” Doctor Bethencourt said as the group stood in front of the gates of the mall, with people passing by, some looking at them but most simply going their way into the building.

“Our main objective is to check on basic necessities, at least on paper. The real purpose of this trip is to enjoy ourselves and waltz around the place.”

Song couldn’t help but roll her eyes at those instructions. Those were some rather vague rough strokes about what could be done as well as the Doctor’s usual tendency to be dramatically cryptic.

Nevertheless everyone just took his words at face value, with many of them nodding in agreement and soon began talking among themselves about what they wanted to do or which options were available within the mall.

 

To Song’s surprise the mall was much more than what she had initially expected, all the information she had looked at up within the network had showed her countless pictures of various malls, while she had focused mostly on those from within the Eagle Union, there was nonetheless a multinational arrangement present, as a result of the island being the base of operations of Azur Lane, meaning that there were various influences on the stores, the variety of goods offered, as well as the people present, giving as a result a much more colorful scene than what she had initially expected.

Then again, with Azur Lane being primarily managed by the Eagle Union, she expected much more fishing and hunting shops, as well as a cartoonish beaver offering a plethora of barbecue-oriented foods roaming around the place.

Her inner musings had quickly come to a halt when she realized they were standing in front of a clothing store with mannequins displaying various arrangements of children's clothes.

“Eh?!” Song was taken aback when she saw two hands extending towards her.

Azuma as well as Avrora stood in front of her, each one at a different side, obviously inviting her to come along with them to the store. The gesture wasn’t lost to Song, she had seen it several times while browsing the network regarding stuff like family trips as well as shopping, the fact that every Kansen had come to the trip in regular clothes, rather than their usual attires, had made this scene look so much more like those in the videos she had seen. But seeing it in front of her had been a whole new experience. Even if she had no real interest in acquiring new clothes, the invitation on its own had been something she hadn’t experienced before. As such, before she even had time to fully process the implications of going into a clothing store the with two doting Kansen, she found herself extending her own hands and holding those of Avrora and Azuma, she focused much more on that particular moment, before she could fully realize that she was being lead into the store.

Probably one hour later, although Song’s sense of time had told her it had been more, and she felt like it had been many more, the two Kansen had gone through every option they had laid their eyes on. Song for her part felt like she had undergone some sort of weird trial in which two aunts would dote all too hard on a kid they had met for the first time. She wasn’t quite sure if she had emerged victorious or not from that.

But at the very least she had obtained three sets of clothes that gave her a somewhat giddy feeling while she was wearing them. The commentary and praise she got from the two doting Kansen also helped her decide on which clothes to pick, truth be told. Azuma, especially, had become pretty immersed into detailing which styles could go along with which clothes and what sort of -feeling- could be ascertained from certain ensembles. Song wasn’t all too sure about any of those things, but she figured that if the others were sincere about this, then there was a grain of truth to what they were saying.

As such, she counted the whole ordeal as a somewhat of a victory.

Song couldn’t help but to notice that the girls playing the role of companions as well as bodyguards had decided to change groups. With Bismarck and Mainz coming back from their small trip along with Doctor Bethencourt. The two Ironblood ladies nodded towards Azuma and Avrora, with the latter now engaging in some small conversation with the Doctor. The former, now heading her way, with Mainz holding a cup of coffee, sniffing at it and twisting her nose as if unsure she agreed with the contents of the paper cup, standing at a reasonable distance from the bench where Song was sitting and now the leader of the Iron Blood was also taking a seat right beside her.

“I must say, this sort of trip is not a bad thing.” Bismarck said.

“It has been an interesting experience so far” Song nodded as she looked at the tall blonde sitting beside her.

“There is much more than we would need, if this was a regular trip for goods. But sights on themselves make for some sort of entertainment, as well as being informative on current trends.”

Song could only nod in agreement, she could see how every single store within the mall offered much less than a specialized store, markedly in terms of quality. Mainz would probably agree with such a statement as she still seemed in disagreement with her coffee.

“Anyway, what did you want to talk about?” Bismarck said as she turned to look at Song.

“Eh? How?!- I mean, what-”

“You have consistently asked for me, since the day you arrived. Not directly, but the insinuations haven’t passed unnoticed by others” She stated calmly.

“Was it Vestal?”

“It was Vestal” Bismarck replied.

Thinking about it, Song chagrined internally, realizing that it probably hadn’t been the most covert action to ask Vestal if the leader of the Iron Blood was seen often within the medical facility of the base.

*Well off with it then. Not going to waste such a fortuitous opportunity even if it comes as a result of my own inexperience.*

“I think there will be a point where either the Doctor or myself, will have to make a choice that neither of us will like.”

“Doctor Bethencourt might not look like it, but he is much more intelligent than he seems, he is also a schemer.The plans he has made, I am sure he will purposefully give the wrong impression to most people, or even unwittingly, but anyway his actions would surely immediately deem him a demon.” Song said as she bit at her lower lip.

“He is already capable of creating weapons that, back in a not too distant past, would have been more than enough to conquer the world. It only requires the wrong impression on someone for the Doctor to be immediately branded a villain”

“Mmmm… Can you share any of these plans?” Bismarck asked as she looked pensive.

“Not really.” Song said as she shook her head “I have only vague ideas about what his intentions are at best. But while I am uncertain of the nature of his plans, he is truly a genius, but he has a penchant for playing the part of the -dark hero-.”

Bismarck thought about the little girl’s words. She expected Song to breach a subject similar to this one, but she hadn’t given enough credit to the reports that she had read about the girl. Song was truly keener than the reports gave her credit for, her childish appearance most likely had given her much discredit in this regard. Although, her concerns were very much like those of a child concerned about their parent, without an inkling of what they could really do to be of assistance.

“Like a -Dark hero-, I see… I think I have come to a better understanding of what manner of issue you have” Bismarck said, calmly closing her eyes deep in thought.

“So, you have a solution for our problems?!” Song asked excitedly.

“No. Unfortunately there is no pre-made solution for such complex situations. But I have a suggestion.”

“Eh? What could this be about?”

“You don’t have to rush for a solution. You can take some time to process the events unfolding in front of you, even while they might seem completely immediate, there is always some time to make a rational decision. Open yourself with your family and make your concerns clear. You don’t need to come to a solution immediately. To be able to explain yourself and give yourself some time to process all the things happening is plenty enough. With your efforts combined on a single front, you stand a better chance of finding a solution that’s right for you and your family.”

“Eh? What are you?-” Song replied as she listened to the Iron Blood’s leader. “B-but I don’t have a family?”

In response to this, the leader of the Iron Blood raised an eyebrow as she looked straight at the child sitting beside her.

“Do you not consider the doctor your family? From what I have heard, the two of you are rather close.”

“We- I guess we could be called close. But- but I was created from wisdom cubes, I am not human, I am not related to him, not like a true family…” The little girl said as her head dipped marginally.

“Has doctor Bethencourt ever called you a -creation-? Or maybe something different, like ‘weapon’ or ‘prototype’? anything that makes it sound that you are not really human?” The Towering Leader of the Iron Blood asked as she tilted her head inquisitively.

“N-No! the Doctor has never!” The little girl stammered as she answered back in bewilderment over such a question “He has even found it hard to try and explain my existence, since he is forced to use words as ‘non-human being’ or ‘non-human organism’, which obviously bothers him. We… we often tease him about it…”

Bismarck hummed in response to that. She seemed pensive for a few moments before producing a silver pocket watch from her pants. She moved her thumb over the small accessory a few times before opening it, inclining it in such a way that Song would see it too, revealing that it was in fact a small compass.

“One day, both Herr Claus and Friedrich asked of me to go visit a certain town in the motherland. It was a weird request they made to me, and it was during a time in which I felt truly overwhelmed with both our work as well as the actions we had taken back then within the -Old Iron Blood-. So I went my way, hoping this was a mission that would at least distract me enough from my inner turmoil.”

“The place was a remote coastal town, with nothing seemingly of interest to it, nor remarkable enough that could have made two of the leaders of our reformed country to ask of me to visit it.There, I met a man who had been waiting for me to arrive. He had served on the Bismarck, the one made of steel, gunpowder, and national pride. He welcomed me as if he had found some long-lost family member, he gathered friends and family alike and made a small feast in my honor. He shared with me food as well as many stories of his comrades and his time in service during the old regimen. He seemed truly happy to see me, even during a time I couldn’t bear to see myself in the mirror.”

“He gave me this compass, which belonged to his mentor and friend within the Bismarck. He said I should use it to know how to return back to the town” Bismarck said as she chuckled, recalling that particular moment, offering the compass for Song to hold.

“I make a point to write to him every now and then, as well as visiting him, along with my sister, if we have the chance.”

“I think that was the intention of Herr Claus and Friedrich, to show me that there are others who wish me well and care for me as family, people who I want to be related to, even if it is not by blood”

“We cannot decide when or under which circumstances we are born into this world. But we do have the opportunity to decide who becomes part of our lives, and sometimes, we also have the opportunity to decide who becomes our family. Is that not one of those privileges granted to humans?”

“I think you and the Doctor share a very special bond. And I think you are already a family of sorts, even if it might not be apparent. He is already your guardian and your mentor, after all, is he not?”

For her part, Song held the little compass on her hands, she thought that it had much more weight than it should for such a little trinket. She stared intently at it while she pondered on the ideas shared by the Iron Blood’s leader, without taking her eyes off the little silver thing, as if it could give her a more definite answer as to why her heart seemed to be both aching as well as singing to her in boundless joy.",2,1737852407.0,AzureLane,1,0.67,False
1ia1qyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1ia1qyn/how_much_does_having_the_right_hobbies_matter_in/,How much does having 'the right hobbies' matter in interviews and forming connections?,"We all know MBB/IB are some of the upper echelon of white collar office work and for a long time has been dominated by people from privileged families who went to expensive schools etc. 

It's getting more diverse now but the vast majority are still from well off/comfortable backgrounds. Due to this, you see many consultants and bankers who have 'posher' interests like golf, wine tasting, and skiing. 

We all know how much relatability matters when it comes to forming a connection during an interview or even during networking or a quick coffee chat. Having common interests can definitely help, but is obviously not necessary. 

That being said, if you have interests that aren't as...shall we say...'refined', would that put you at a disadvantage? 

For example, let's say you do boxing/combat sports as a hobby. Would that consultant or banker who is interviewing you who had a privileged upbringing and played lacrosse at Yale most likely look down on you for your 'lower class hobby'?

I'm probably over thinking it but sometimes these things matter. There's a reason why so many people in these industries are almost carbon copies of one another.

1ia1qxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1ia1qxk/scam_meeting_at_target/,Scam? Meeting at target,"My husband and I and our baby were at target and this man comes up to us. And says cute baby. And makes small talk. This is Normal. But then it got into a convo of trying to get to know us. He says misses his baby - his wife is pregnant again and isn’t here but went out of state with the baby so she can be with her mom. Again that’s not all that abnormal and I thought oh maybe he just misses his baby but he was just like giving info and we gave some back. It seemed like he wanted to be friends I guess. I know it’s hard making friends and he wasn’t born here but he has been on the area for 21 years so idk
He said he was a bioengineer at an icu but then 
Then he had his baby and decided to work at a resort as an engineer (which aren’t the same engineering field but he said as like a maintenance guy). 
He had coffee and something else in his hands but he was in the baby section. Idk. At the end he of course was like we should meet up grab tea because his daughter was the same age as my baby. He gave my husband his number and said call me and got his number. But we are all sketched out now. 
The photos he showed of his wife (gorgeous but he way) and baby - one of them looked a bit photoshopped. 
And he was talking about how he met her at church (which is amazing) but said he met this other couple who quit their jobs to be full time parents - like if that is a choice. He said ya I want to know what his wisdom is and u have to really be around ppl who can teach you that. And said him and his wife want to be full time parents. 

Like no shit - who doesn’t want a job. But like what normal (non trust fund) human can just quit a job and be a full time parent. 
We didn’t ask about it we really just let him talk. 

Idk is this a potential scam? 
Like get into a relationship then say he needs money.  

Thoughts block him? 
Can they do anything with my husband phone number?
