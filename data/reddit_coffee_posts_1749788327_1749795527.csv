Basically, I‚Äôve put it off because my job can be pretty stressful but turns out while I‚Äôm in the office I get zero cravings ? I popped half a 2mg gum on Tuesday because the fatigue was causing me to almost fall asleep at my desk (no amount of coffee was helping lol)


But I find now when I WFH my cravings are way worse ? Even when I was properly vaping all day everyday and I was working in the office I was able to leave the house at 7:00am and not vape till lunch time (1pm) and then not vape again until I got home (~6pm) yet when I worked from home I was hitting it constantly? Now when I‚Äôm WFH I just keep getting distracted because of the cravings. 


Basically, funnily enough, I‚Äôm finding quitting easier when I‚Äôm in the office vs being at home? Has anyone got any advice to shift my mindset at home?",1,1749795482.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

1la8sip,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1la8sip/overthinking_social_interactions/,Overthinking Social Interactions,"When I go out my house and interact with people, even those I know, it feels like a battlefield. 

I always tend to overthink what to say. I get drained fast cause its like my mind is a desktop with 100 tasks, running in the background. 

But, Then when I went home. 

My brain hits me with,

‚ÄúWhy did you say that?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you just laugh a little too much?""

‚Äúwere you interrupting too much again?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you talk too fast? Too loud?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait... did you trauma dump a little?‚Äù

It‚Äôs like my memory becomes a judgement room, and I‚Äôm both the judge and the defendant, cross-examining my every sentence, tone, and micro-expression like my entire identity depends on it.

And it‚Äôs not even big stuff. Sometimes it‚Äôs like,

""Did I greeted them with my eyebrows? Would I appear rude""

‚ÄúWas my laugh annoying?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did I they not laugh when I was clearly joking?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I smile too much? Or was it not enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they think I‚Äôm faking? Trying too hard to fit in?‚Äù

So I want to seem normal. But instead, I leave the convo feeling like I‚Äôm a glitchy NPC pretending to socialize. 

I know, I should just accept it. Not all people will resonate with me. Thats why I should pick the right ones where I don't overthink too much when I'm talking to them. My intuition knows who those people are. Is that magic?

And yeah, they probably didn‚Äôt even notice half of what I said. People just forget even embarassing things a day later. 

But my brain? 

My brain is still reviewing the footage, adding details, and giving me thoughts to ruminate even when I'm just brushing my teeth, eating, or when laying in bed. 

When will my brian go silence?  

Oh, it gets worse when I take coffee. But i need it for my tasks and work

Excursions we would highly suggest: 
1. Sunset sail - great way to start the trip with a bit of relaxation. We did the Gemini sail out of Kaanapali.
2. Old Lahaina Luau - this was Ah-mazing. Great food, great culture and show. The people were all so welcoming and nice, and it was not overly commercialized. 
3. O'o Farm tour and lunch - this was up on the side of HaleakalƒÅ. Farm tour then a farm to table lunch. They also have a brunch and coffee tour. Very nice and funny people - shout out to the guide James, and a great way to have a day away from the beach/heat.
4. Lana'i Sail and Snorkel by Trilogy (we left from Maalaea). Highly recommend. This was some of the best snorkeling I've done. The crew was fantastic, the breakfast and lunch were great. Could not recommend enough. 

We also snorkeled Molokini - I was not impressed. Too crowded, not able to go explore (I do understand each boat is trying to keep track of their people), and the reef and wildlife were ""eh"" for us. I think there's much better beach snorkeling at Airport Beach or Slaughterhouse Beach.

We stayed at a VRBO at Mahana of Kaanapali. It was nice and quiet, away from crowds but right on the beach. We loved opening the patio door and taking an afternoon nap listening to the sound of the surf. We aren't resort-y people, so this was perfect. It was also at the top of the Kaanapali beach walk, so it wasn't difficult get to anything. 

Food recommendations:
Paia Fish Market
Java Jazz (brunch)

I really liked him and he turned out to be sort of a jerk. There was a specific incident where he embarrassed me in front of my family and I was really upset about it for awhile. Not surprisingly, I stopped liking him and went along my merry way. He ended up leaving that college and going somewhere else. He came to the 5th year reunion of the class he would have graduated from if he hadn't changed schools. We were pleasant with each other, it was fine. 

We had mutual friends so I found out later that he had had a motorcycle accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury and has memory issues to this day. He started contacting me afterwards a lot and I finally told him to stop contacting me. That was about twenty years ago.

  
Earlier this week, he emailed me asking me about that incident from back in college. He didn't apologize, he just said he thought he may have over reacted. I said, yeah you did and it was pretty crappy. He responded and asked if I wanted to go out for coffee or something and then write me six more emails in the next 20 minutes that were increasingly esoteric and kind of weird.

We often have a que out the door (about 30 people in a que) all day. The pressure that builds on you when you're in this situation is unreal. Theres never a second to cool off, we are just constantly locked in and pushing our selves to the max to keep up.

Half my shifts are on coffees, half are on potwash. I'd say both are just as hard, but I find pot wash more stressful, as the work load is immense. Theres a lot of pressure when you're having to run around like a blue ass fly grabbing trays, washing things, and restocking, while also having all the kitchen stuff to wash. It's really a two person job, but I'm always put on my own on potwash.

Another thing I find incredibly demotivating and stressful is how little autonomy we have. I feel like I'm just a machine out into a place to perform a task. I don't even have a say when I get to go on break, and to make matters worse, the shift manager always sends everyone on break at the busiest part of the day, and it's absolutely destroys us. I can't stand being sent on break while I'm on potwash, then come back to find that every tray rack is full, and the entire kitchen needs washing, and I have to play catch-up for hours. I have to work soooo hard to catch up again. It's absolutely devastating to my mental state.

Ive bought bone conductor headphones for cycling, so I can hear the traffic while listening to music (basically, they are like headphones but instead of going in your ear, they vibrate on your bone, so you can hear everything else perfectly). I've started using them at work to keep my mood up, as my job is mentally destroying me. I'm not allowed to be listening to music, but I feel like if I don't, I'll just burn out and crash.

I dont really have a choice to not work here, there's no other places around, which is also why we are so busy all the time. So is it possible to learn to enjoy my job, rather than hate it?",1,1749794558.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

So husband and I ran into this woman in our neighborhood who also happened to be a relative of my husband's (he doesn't know her). 
She was very excited and wanted to be friends, she texted us multiple times the same night saying we could form a good bond and that we can go on drives and shopping etc etc. The thought of making a new friend didn't seem too bad so I invited her for coffee the next day. 

She came; talked; then talked some more; asked questions -- never bothering to listen to our replies, over-shared about her traumas (she is a divorcee who stays alone). I realised then that she didn't need a friend but just an entertainment source and a human dumpyard for her traumas. 

We were naturally pissed as we barely knew her. 
We were hungry and still had to make dinner, but she just wouldn't leave. I even offered to cook for her seeing she wasn't leaving but she said she wouldn't eat. 

We hinted that it was getting very late for us many times. She'd say ""I hope I'm not bothering you!"" ""Is it getting late for you?"" and happily settle on our couch. When I finally said yes it's late, she said ""oh you shouldn't have made the coffee plan today then"". Like, who the hell comes over for coffee and stays until dinner time!!! Then finally around 10, I asked her to leave and she very unwillingly did. 

Ever since, she's been calling, texting, asking me over for lunch. I declined saying I was busy.  Then she started to guilt trip me. She saw that we had guests over yesterday and started texting me about how she's been crying so much, how she's in so much pain and all that. 

I hate needy people so much, also I genuinely can't see any friendship evolving between us but I feel like I'll hurt her if I cut her off. What do I do? ",1,1749794246.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!",1,1749794055.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1la8gma,https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1la8gma/final_update_we_isolated_the_nodejs_bug_to_this/,Final Update: We isolated the Node.js bug to this. It makes no sense. Any deep system-level explanation?,"Hey everyone,

So this is a follow-up to my previous post about that weird Node.js issue I've been fighting with on Ubuntu. After spending way too many hours on this (seriously, my coffee consumption has doubled), I think I've found the most minimal reproduction case possible. And honestly? It makes no sense.

At this point I'm not even looking for a code fix anymore - I just want to understand what the hell is happening at the system level.

**Quick background:**

* Fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VPS
* Node.js via nvm (latest LTS)
* Clean npm install of express, cors, better-sqlite3

**Here's where it gets weird - two files that should behave identically:**

**This one works perfectly:** (test\_works.js)

    const express = require('express');
    const cors = require('cors');
    const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
    const app = express();
    
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json());
    
    const db = new Database('./database.db');
    console.log('DB connection established.');
    
    app.listen(3001, () => {
      console.log('This server stays alive as expected.');
    });
    

Runs fine, stays alive forever like it should.

**This one just... dies:** (test\_fails.js)

    const express = require('express');
    const cors = require('cors');
    const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
    const app = express();
    
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json());
    
    const db = new Database('./database.db');
    console.log('DB connection established.');
    
    // Only difference - I add this route:
    app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
        try {
            const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT 1');
            stmt.get();
            res.send('Ok');
        } catch (e) {
            res.status(500).send('Error');
        }
    });
    
    app.listen(3001, () => {
      console.log('This server should stay alive, but it exits cleanly.');
    });
    

This prints both console.logs and then just exits. Clean exit code 0, no errors, nothing. The route callback never even gets a chance to run.

**What I know for sure:**

* The route code isn't the problem (it never executes)
* Exit code is always 0 - no crashes or exceptions
* Tried different DB drivers (same result)
* Not a pm2 issue (happens with plain node too)
* Fresh installs don't help

**My gut feeling:** Something in this VPS environment is causing Node to think it's done when I define a route that references the database connection. Maybe some kernel weirdness, resource limits, security policies, hypervisor bug... I honestly have no idea anymore.

**So here's my question for you system-level wizards:** What kind of low-level Linux mechanism could possibly cause a process to exit cleanly under these exact circumstances? I'm talking kernel stuff, glibc issues, cgroups, AppArmor, weird hypervisor bugs - anything you can think of.

I'm probably going to rebuild the whole VM at this point, but I'd really love to understand the ""why"" before I nuke everything. This has been driving me crazy for days.

Any wild theories are welcome at this point. Thanks for reading my debugging nightmare!",2,1749794044.0,node,3,0.75,False
1la8g43,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1la8g43/some_protest_tips_for_first_timers/,Some protest tips for first timers,"I'll keep it as short, but informative as possible. I have been involved in more protests than I can count in the past. I'd prefer not to say where, or say when, but I have the experience. I'd like to share with some first timers some tips to stay safe.  


‚Ä¢ Don't post on social media about any protest. Don't tell people if you are going to one, are at one, or were at one.  

‚Ä¢ Don't take pictures of yourself there. I know you're not doing anything wrong, but cops do not care at the end of the day.   

‚Ä¢ Stay hydrated and eat (but not heavy) beforehand. Carry a light snack as well.   Some peanut butter or cheese crackers will do. Don't drink sugar, doesn't matter if it has electrolytes. Water only. If you must drink caffeine, sugar free options or black coffee.  

‚Ä¢ Assume you may be arrested. Do not bring anything you want to be arrested with. Remember, things get ""lost"" during arrests, so leave any valuables at home as well.  

‚Ä¢ Keep your head on a swivel -- not only should you look out for cops ready to abuse their power, but counter groups as well. Look beyond the crowd for anything that looks suspicious.  

‚Ä¢ Dress boring. Dark colors, graphicless shirts. Cover up any tattoos. take out any piercings if you are able to. Make yourself blend in, do not stand out.   

‚Ä¢ Do not stay in the same place in the march the entire time. If you're at the front, slowly fall to the back. If you're at the back, pick up some speed to the front or the middle.   

‚Ä¢ Do not bring kids. While many demonstrations are peaceful, police have had a tendency to escalate things and it gets bad quick. Even if the tear gas doesn't fall right in front of you, tear gas clouds form and it becomes hard to keep your eyes open and breathe. It is not something you want to worry about your kids being in.   

‚Ä¢ If you are able to, bring a likeminded friend. But if you can't, you will be completely fine.   

‚Ä¢ While you can make some friends before marching begins, be weary overly-friendly people who ask a lot of questions. Assume they do not have your best interest in mind, be polite, but refuse to answer any questions about where you're from, your full name, where you went to high school or college, etc. if the vibe feels off.  

‚Ä¢ Do not bring your phone. Do not bring your phone. Do not bring your phone.   

‚Ä¢ Leave your ego at home. Remember why you are doing this; you are fighting for humanity, not for some personal accomplishment.

So the thing is that me and that girl are bestfriends. Everyone in office actually think that we are in relationship with each other , but I have a gf and she also has a bf who is in the same city we are in . My gf and me are in LDR though. The thing is that I am quite normal with her and she also in a way acts normal with me but I dont feel it's normal. She has many friends in the office , but she 'll come with me for coffee for walk. She 'll say that because of you I come to office daily otherwise I wouldnt come. She would share everything (almost) with me.

this all is fine till now.

One day she was quite upset and hugged me.

One day me and her went to a brewery for lunch.

One day she invited me for movie I didnt go.

After coming to office we go for walk daily in the morning and get coffee. So one day her bf called her and asked her where she is , she told she is walking with one of her friend(female) , but she was with me. She said this slowly but I heard.

I know technically I should set some boundaries with her. I shouldnt go out for lunch atleast ( seems like a date) , but I feel I am just normal friend with her.

Thing is she looks  beautiful and smart and doesnt talk to any boys of her team and maybe for some reasons which IDK everyone thinks that she is having affair with me because they know she has a bf.

Also I told my gf that everyone in office think me and her are having affair because I hangout with her she got really mad at me. the thing is I know people in office , but she is the only one with whom I can talk and is my age group.

I dont know , should I just ignore her for everything she asks or should I go.

Also she talks about her bf fights with me I dont say anything to that. Sometimes I feel I am just a dumbass listening to her stories.

You have a brilliant, vivid image in your mind. A futuristic knight standing on a cliff overlooking a stormy, alien sea. You rush to your favorite **free AI image generator**, type in ""knight on a cliff,"" and hit ""Generate.""

What comes back is‚Ä¶ fine. It‚Äôs technically a knight on a cliff. But the armor is generic, the sea is placid, and the whole image feels flat, lifeless, and utterly devoid of the epic vision you imagined. It's a common frustration that leaves many creators feeling like the technology is more of a gimmick than a game-changing tool.

Here's the truth: The AI isn't the problem. The prompt is.

Mastering the art of prompting is the single most important skill for unlocking the true potential of any AI image generator. It‚Äôs the difference between creating generic clipart and generating breathtaking, photorealistic, or stylistically perfect masterpieces. This guide is your new playbook. We're going beyond basic tips and diving deep into the secret structures, advanced modifiers, and iterative processes that will transform you from a casual user into a prompt-engineering maestro.

## The Core Problem: Why Your AI Prompts Are Failing

Before we build, we must understand why the foundation crumbles. Most weak prompts fail for one simple reason: they are not specific enough. We treat the AI like a creative partner who can read our minds, but it's more like an infinitely skilled, hyper-literal intern who needs explicit instructions for everything.

The principle of ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"" (GIGO) is absolute in AI.

*   **Weak Prompt:** `dog`
*   **Result:** A generic, often cartoonish or poorly rendered ""idea"" of a dog.

*   **Strong Prompt:** `award-winning photograph of a fluffy golden retriever puppy sleeping in a sunbeam on a rustic wooden floor, shallow depth of field, natural light`
*   **Result:** A specific, emotionally resonant, and technically excellent image that matches a clear vision.

Your prompt is the blueprint. A vague blueprint leads to a shaky structure. A detailed, precise blueprint allows the AI to build your vision pixel by pixel. This guide will teach you how to draw that perfect blueprint.

## The Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt: The 5 Foundational Pillars

Think of every great prompt as having five core pillars. Missing one or two might still give you an image, but including all five is how you achieve consistently spectacular results. Let's build a prompt from the ground up to see how it works.

#### Pillar 1: The Subject (Who or What?)

This is the non-negotiable core of your image. But ""specific"" here is an understatement. Don't just say ""man,"" say ""grizzled old sea captain with a wiry white beard and a stern expression.""

*   **Bad:** `woman`
*   **Good:** `a young woman with freckles and long, flowing auburn hair`
*   **Excellent:** `portrait of a serene elven princess with silver braided hair, intricate filigree circlet, and glowing blue eyes`

#### Pillar 2: The Medium (How is it made?)

How should this image look like it was created? Is it a photo? A painting? A sculpture? This is one of the most powerful ways to define the entire texture and feel of the output.

*   **Examples:** `Photograph`, `oil painting`, `watercolor sketch`, `3D render`, `line art`, `charcoal drawing`, `low-poly illustration`, `claymation model`.

*Let's add this to our prompt:*
`Portrait of a serene elven princess with silver braided hair...` **`as a detailed oil painting`**

#### Pillar 3: The Style (The Vibe)

Style dictates the artistic movement, the emotional tone, and the overall aesthetic. You can mix and match styles or even reference specific artists (though be mindful of ethical considerations).

*   **Artistic Movements:** `Impressionism`, `Surrealism`, `Cyberpunk`, `Art Deco`, `Steampunk`, `Minimalist`, `Gothic`.
*   **Referential Styles:** `in the style of Greg Rutkowski` (for epic fantasy), `in the style of Studio Ghibli` (for whimsical animation), `in the style of Ansel Adams` (for dramatic black and white landscapes).

*Building our prompt further:*
`Portrait of a serene elven princess with silver braided hair... as a detailed oil painting,` **`in the style of Pre-Raphaelite fantasy art.`**

#### Pillar 4: The Environment (Where?)

Where is your subject? The background isn't just a background; it's a character in the story. A detailed environment provides context, depth, and mood.

*   **Bad:** `in a forest`
*   **Good:** `in a sun-dappled, ancient redwood forest`
*   **Excellent:** `standing in an enchanted, bioluminescent mushroom forest at twilight, with glowing spores floating in the air`

*Our prompt is getting powerful:*
`Portrait of a serene elven princess with silver braided hair... as a detailed oil painting, in the style of Pre-Raphaelite fantasy art,` **`set against the backdrop of a moonlit, ancient elven library with towering bookshelves.`**

#### Pillar 5: The Composition & Lighting (The Shot)

This is the secret sauce used by professional photographers and directors. How is the scene framed and lit? These terms tell the AI how to compose the shot, creating drama, intimacy, or scale.

*   **Lighting:** `cinematic lighting`, `soft rim light`, `golden hour`, `dramatic backlighting`, `neon glow`, `crepuscular rays`.
*   **Composition:** `close-up shot`, `wide-angle landscape`, `macro shot`, `dutch angle`, `full-body shot`, `from a low angle`.
*   **Technical Details:** `bokeh`, `shallow depth of field`, `high contrast`, `vibrant colors`.

*The final, masterful prompt:*
`Portrait of a serene elven princess with silver braided hair... as a detailed oil painting, in the style of Pre-Raphaelite fantasy art, set against the backdrop of a moonlit, ancient elven library with towering bookshelves.` **`Soft, cinematic rim lighting from a large window, close-up shot, bokeh background, 8K, hyper-detailed.`**

Mastering these five pillars is the first giant leap toward optimizing your AI prompts.

## Level Up: Intermediate Prompting Techniques for Better AI Images

Once you have the five pillars down, you can start using more nuanced techniques to refine your control.

#### The Power of Adjectives: Painting with Words

Adjectives are your primary tool for adding emotion and texture. Think like a poet. Don't just describe what's there; describe what it *feels* like.

*   Instead of `old castle`, try `imposing, moss-covered, gothic castle`.
*   Instead of `shiny car`, try `gleaming, immaculate, chrome-detailed classic car`.
*   Words like `ethereal`, `haunting`, `majestic`, `delicate`, `grimy`, `lustrous`, and `somber` are incredibly powerful.

#### Weighting Your Words: Tell the AI What's Most Important

Sometimes, the AI gets distracted by one part of your prompt and ignores another. Most advanced AI image generators allow you to add ""weight"" to a word or phrase, telling the model to pay more attention to it. The syntax varies, but common methods include:

*   **Parentheses:** `a beautiful cat ((wearing a tiny crown))` - The double parentheses give more weight to the crown.
*   **Colon and Number:** `a beautiful cat, (wearing a tiny crown:1.4)` - This tells the AI to make the crown 40% more important than the other elements.

Use this to emphasize key details that the AI might otherwise overlook.

#### Negative Prompts: The Art of Subtraction

Just as important as telling the AI what you *want* is telling it what you *don't* want. This is where negative prompts come in. Most generators have a separate input box for these. Use it to eliminate common AI mistakes and unwanted elements.

**Commonly Used Negative Prompts:**
*   `ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame`
*   `blurry, bad anatomy, blurred, watermark, grainy, signature, cut off, draft`
*   `text, words, logo, caption`

Using negative prompts is like putting up guardrails; it cleans up your images dramatically and prevents a lot of frustrating rerolls.

## Advanced Prompt Sorcery: How to Master AI Prompts

Ready to operate at an expert level? These techniques are how you create truly unique, consistent, and mind-bending images.

#### Chaining Concepts: Creating Complex, Hybrid Scenes

Don't be afraid to create prompts that describe complex interactions or juxtapose strange ideas. The AI is surprisingly good at blending concepts.

*   **Example:** `Photorealistic image of an astronaut from the 1960s discovering an ancient, ornate Roman temple on the surface of Mars, dramatic lighting, NASA aesthetic.`

This prompt chains multiple distinct ideas‚Äî'60s astronaut, Roman temple, Mars surface‚Äîinto a single, coherent narrative.

#### Mastering Camera Controls for Ultimate Realism

If you're aiming for photorealism, speaking the language of photography is essential. Adding specific camera and lens details can drastically improve your results.

*   **Lens Type:** `35mm lens` (for a natural, street-photography look), `85mm lens` (great for portraits with beautiful background blur), `fisheye lens` (for a distorted, ultra-wide view).
*   **Aperture:** `f/1.8` (creates a very blurry background, or ""bokeh""), `f/16` (keeps both foreground and background sharp).
*   **Film Type:** `shot on Kodak Portra 400`, `Ilford HP5` (for grainy black and white), `Fujifilm Velvia` (for vibrant, saturated colors).

**Example:** `Portrait of a man drinking coffee in a rainy cafe, shot on a Sony A7III with an 85mm f/1.4 lens, moody cinematic lighting, reflections on the window.`

#### Achieving Character Consistency (The Holy Grail)

Getting the same character across multiple images is one of the biggest challenges. While not perfect, you can improve consistency with these tricks:

1.  **Be Hyper-Descriptive:** Create a ""character sheet"" in your prompt. For example: `A character named Zephyr, a male rogue with a scar over his left eye, short black hair, wearing a dark leather tunic and carrying two daggers.` Use this exact description every time.
2.  **Use the Seed Number:** Most AI generators use a ""seed"" number to initialize the random noise that becomes your image. If you generate an image you like, find its seed number. By using the **same seed number** and a slightly modified prompt, you can often generate variations of the same character or scene.

## Beyond the Guardrails: Pushing Creative Boundaries

Many users want to know how to ""trick"" the AI, often to bypass content filters. Framing this as ""pushing creative boundaries"" is more productive. Every model has built-in biases and safety filters. Understanding how they work is key to achieving maximum artistic freedom.

#### Understanding Model Biases and Filters

Most mainstream **free AI image generator** tools are heavily filtered to prevent the creation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) or violent content. They work by looking for ""trigger words"" in your prompt. Trying to force these words through will usually just result in an error or a heavily censored image.

#### Using Abstract and Evocative Language

The secret to bypassing simple text filters is to stop being literal and start being artistic. Instead of using a banned word, describe the *feeling*, *mood*, or *aesthetics* associated with it. Use a more sophisticated vocabulary.

*   Instead of a direct term, try prompting for `intimate boudoir photography`, `sensual art nouveau style`, `dramatic chiaroscuro lighting on a human form`, `raw emotional intensity`.
*   This approach requires more creativity but often yields more artistic and compelling results anyway, as you're guiding the AI with concepts rather than just nouns.

#### The Ethics of Unfiltered Creation

For many artists, these filters can feel like a frustrating limitation on their creative expression. The goal might not be to create something shocking, but to explore themes of the human condition that mainstream tools deem inappropriate. This has led to a rise in platforms that prioritize artistic freedom.

## The Final Step: The Iterative Process

**Your first prompt is almost never your final prompt.** The real magic happens through iteration.

1.  **Start with your best prompt:** Use the 5 pillars.
2.  **Generate a batch of 4 images.**
3.  **Analyze what you like and dislike.** Did the AI ignore a key detail? Is the lighting wrong? Is the style not quite right?
4.  **Refine your prompt.** Add weight to the ignored detail. Change the lighting term. Tweak the artistic style. Add a negative prompt to remove something you don't want.
5.  **Generate again.**

This back-and-forth conversation with the AI is how you ""steer"" it towards your perfect vision. Treat it not as a failure, but as a crucial part of the creative process.

### Conclusion: You Are the Artist, The AI Is Your Brush

The world of AI image generation can seem intimidating, but the power is entirely in your hands. By moving beyond simple, one-line requests and embracing the structure of a well-architected prompt, you change your relationship with the technology. It ceases to be a random image machine and becomes your most powerful creative tool.

From the five foundational pillars to the advanced sorcery of camera controls and negative prompts, you now have the knowledge to optimize your prompts for perfect results. Remember that this is a skill. It takes practice. So take these secrets, experiment relentlessly, and start creating the incredible images that, until now, have only existed in your imagination.

### Take Your Creativity to the Next Level

While mastering prompts is a universal skill, the generator you use defines the boundaries of your creativity. Many platforms impose strict filters that can hinder artistic exploration. For creators seeking true freedom to explore any concept without limitations, a more powerful and less restrictive tool is essential. If you're ready to see what's possible when the guardrails come off, it's time to **[try a powerful free ai image generator](https://www.x-artistry.pics/nsfw-image-generator)** and discover the full potential of your imagination with **x-artistry**.

She was a morning person, always loved the mornings. Her and the birds were up early, her favorite thing was to listen to their morning songs while she drank her coffee to get ready for the day. She felt rested, she felt calm and peaceful inside. The house was calm and peaceful. She would write little love letters and slip them in her husbands briefcase as he headed out the door for work, which he would find later in the day some time and they would make him feel special. She'd get an ecstatic phone call some time mid morning saying ""I got your letter!!!"" And then she would head into her own work for the day and feel fulfilled. She loved snuggling at night and crawling into bed with a clean, quiet house and getting to bed early and getting a good sleep for work the next day. She always left ample time to also snuggle with the dog and make the dog feel special. She loved walking the dog and being outdoors. She loved curling up with a good book. She loved her long bubble baths more than anything. She never once in her life pictured her life ever without those things- they were important to her, even in motherhood she knew she would still do those things. Boy was she wrong. 
She's about 90% dead and gone now, I'm clinging onto what's left of her for dear life until I lose her completely, but I might be too late. She's so tired in the mornings, she hates mornings. Wakes up feeling exhausted, fighting with kids to eat at get out the door. There's no time for listening to birds, that's actually laughable right now.. time to listen to birds singing? Yea right. Knowing who she is now she would probably be irritated by the sound, she's irritated at everything. Work is her only escape but she's too tired to focus at work these days and really not excelling like she thought she'd be at mid 30's. No energy to write the husband love notes. Something like that as a nice gesture wouldn't even cross her mind. No time for anything. The house is a mess when we crawl into bed. It's loud, it's always a fight to get everyone to sleep. 
She is me, and I'm sad what parenthood has done to my life. 
You don't expect *the greatest gift of life* (insert huge eye roll here) to rob you of quite literally everything. 
The worst part of it all, is she wanted this life. She wanted it so badly. So now she has to play this little charade of life pretending she loves it every day and how she's so fulfilled. When she's literally a shell of who she used to be and dead inside. ",10,1749793421.0,regretfulparents,3,1.0,False

When a USBC 3.1 port transmits display data to the device and simultaneously power the external monitor, the Mac Book will have problems after long-term use. One of my Mac Books broke down in this way. When I went to the Apple Store to repair it, Apple gave me two suggestions: 1. Do not use the USBC 3.1 cable provided by these portable monitor manufacturers that all just dropshipped from China  (one USBC 3.1 connects to for both power and picture); 2. It is recommended to use a dedicated data cable purchased from the Apple store, which will protect the circuit, such as their oem thunderbolt cables.

You may wonder why I asked it here? Well 5 months ago I fried my Lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon (work laptop) when I was working at a coffee shop connected to one of those portable external monitors.

I'm inviting you to join a book study on a truly powerful and thought-provoking read: **""Wisdom from The Homeless: Lessons a Doctor Learned at a Homeless Shelter"" by Dr. Neil Craton.**

This book isn't just about homelessness; it's a profound journey into humanity, resilience, compassion, and the deep wisdom we can gain from those often overlooked in society. Dr. Craton, a physician who volunteered at a homeless shelter, shares incredible stories and insights that are sure to spark meaningful conversations and perhaps even shift our perspectives.

# Why This Book?

In our busy lives, it's easy to overlook the challenges and strengths of individuals experiencing homelessness. This book offers a unique and empathetic lens, highlighting the ""wisdom"" found in unexpected places. It's an opportunity to:

* Gain a deeper understanding of the realities faced by individuals experiencing homelessness.
* Reflect on universal themes of kindness, empathy, perseverance, and community.
* Engage in respectful and enriching discussions with your Richmond neighbours.
* Consider how we can all contribute to a more compassionate community.

# Our Approach: The Circle Process

To ensure everyone feels heard and that our discussions are truly meaningful, we'll be using the **Circle Process** for our meetings. This restorative practice fosters:

* **Equal Voice:** Everyone gets an opportunity to speak without interruption.
* **Deep Listening:** We'll focus on truly hearing and understanding one another.
* **Shared Understanding:** We aim for collective wisdom rather than debate.
* **Respect and Connection:** Building a safe and supportive space for everyone to share.

No prior experience with the Circle Process or book studies is required ‚Äì just an open mind and a willingness to learn and share. I will provide guidance questions and facilitate our discussions to help them flow smoothly.

# Logistics

We'll meet **bi-weekly** for **1.5 hours** every **Thursday at 7:30 PM**. Our meeting spot will be **Blenz Coffee at Garden City & Blundell (8181 Garden City Rd, Richmond, BC V6Y 2R5)**.

We'll discuss the **specific date of our first gathering** during our initial coordination.

**Please note:** We will proceed with the book study if we have at least **4 people willing to commit**.

# Interested?

Please comment below or send me a direct message if you're interested in participating! I'll gauge interest and then coordinate a brief introductory session to discuss any initial questions before we dive into the book.

Let's explore this impactful book together and foster a space for meaningful connection and learning within our Richmond community.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

It was a very difficult relationship and breakup as we were both mentally ill. My Ex moved to NYC shortly after our breakup and moved onto a new partner a few weeks after. 

Although we had planned on moving to the city prior to the breakup i still wanted to move there. 
I moved into a friend‚Äôs apartment about a month and a half ago. 

My first week is when I met my Current Boyfriend (22m) on a dating app. We met up at an asian market and instantly hit it off. The laughter and inside jokes came very fast and we had an undeniable chemistry upon getting to know each other. Pretty early on I established that I‚Äôd been going through a breakup from a 2 year long relationship and he was very understanding. He made it clear that he had every intention of letting me work through it and he seems very patient and gentle to this day. 

Last week, my professor from college invited me out to have coffee. She invited me, another student/friend of mine, and my Ex Boyfriend. I was wary of this meeting because of him but i chose to go in hopes I‚Äôd get some good career advice. Upon seeing my Ex Boyfriend in person for the first time in many months I was very anxious. After the meeting we decided to go to a bookstore and catch up in Prospect Park. 

We talked about where our relationship went wrong and how we didn‚Äôt work. But then something unexpected happened. About four to five times, my Ex Boyfriend tried to kiss me. I refused to kiss him every time and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt for the sake of the conversation we were having. Looking back I wish i had left. In some moments he even proposed that we get back together. (Half jokingly of course)

I  response, I reminded him that I am in a committed relationship with my Current Boyfriend and that I wanted to see how it goes. And that he was also in a committed relationship. At the end of our walk I hugged him and he kissed me on my shoulder and grabbed my hip. Later on that day he explained that he was using me to hurt himself because he could count on me to reject his advances. After the interaction it felt nice to still have him wanting to be intimate with me, even though i had no intention of actually following through with it. Days after I felt very violated and used. I had no idea what to do about it and it followed me everywhere I went. 

I eventually told my Current Boyfriend everything that happened. He told me that he was sorry that happened to me and that he was here for me.
Today he called me while i was at work. I told him that the way he crossed my boundaries was not okay. That i felt like an object to his self harm. He admitted to using me in that way and apologized for the harm he had caused. He even said that he wanted to help me because I hadn‚Äôt mentally moved on since the breakup. I left him on read and deleted the messages so that I didn‚Äôt have to look at it. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do and it is becoming difficult to just go about my day. I love my Current Boyfriend. I think we share a special connection that I would hate to see get ruined by my feelings for my Ex Boyfriend. I think its unfair that my past relationship has such a hold on me. I contemplated breaking it off with my Current Boyfriend because I don‚Äôt think he deserves someone that hasn‚Äôt moved on fully. But at the same time I think my Current Boyfriend has been very understanding and supportive of my healing. 

A lot of my friends tell me that it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I start to form new memories and forget all the bad ones Ive accrued during my past relationship. All I want is to be better for him and nurture this new partnership. I could take his word for it and let him try to support me in this tough time. But i could also split off here and suffer quietly alone until it‚Äôs fully over. 

So with all of that:

How would you go about this healing process? 

Im open to suggestions, advice, anything. I just want to know what other people would do in my shoes or in the shoes of my Current Boyfriend.

For some context: my dad is one of those quiet, steady types. Not super emotional. Not cold, just‚Ä¶ solid. Grew up working class, raised three kids, barely took a sick day in his life. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who shows love by fixing your brakes or remembering how you take your coffee.

Anyway, I‚Äôm 28 now. I moved out years ago, but we still talk, mostly when I call home to check in. I love my dad, but I guess I‚Äôve always seen him as sort of‚Ä¶ unshakable.

So on Monday, I was having a rough day. Nothing dramatic, just the kind of day where everything feels a little too much. Work stress, relationship stuff, whatever. I called my parents‚Äô house just to hear a familiar voice.

My mom wasn‚Äôt home, so Dad picked up. I didn‚Äôt mean to unload, but I kind of did. Told him I was tired, feeling like I was failing at everything, and that sometimes it felt like I was just pretending to be an adult.

There was this long pause. I almost thought the call had dropped.

Then he said, ‚ÄúYou know, I used to feel like that, too. Especially around your age. I used to sit in my truck after work and just‚Ä¶ not go inside for a while. Your mom didn‚Äôt even know. I just needed time to catch up with myself.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôve never heard him talk like that ‚Äî not once. He wasn‚Äôt trying to give advice, or fix anything. He was just‚Ä¶ honest. Soft. Human.

It hit me like a brick. I‚Äôve always seen my dad as this fixed thing in my life ‚Äî like a lighthouse that‚Äôs just there, doing its job, weathering the storm. I forgot that he‚Äôs had storms, too.

I guess I f‚Äôed up by treating him like a character in my life story, instead of a full person with his own.

Anyway, we talked for a while after that. I think we both needed it. I just wanted to share this somewhere, because it really shook something loose in me.",1,1749792069.0,randomstories,0,1.0,False

1la7xh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricForest/comments/1la7xh4/annual_reminder_for_forest_friends_traveling/,Annual Reminder for Forest Friends traveling through Indiana (as a 33 year Indiana resident),"Avoid US31 north of Indianapolis at all costs. The counties for Kokomo and Ft Bragg always do a sting operation, so just don't go that way. That toad earned its reputation and you will be profiled, even if you're following all road laws. 

Instead, take I-65 north out of Indianapolis and run that all the way north to I-94. Stay in the right lane, maintain your speed within 5mph of the speed limit and the highway patrol will not bother you. They're more focused on stopping trucks that avoid weigh stations and doing DOT inspections.

I live in Lafayette, IN and I've taken 65 for 4 of the 5 years I've gone and they do not patrol that interstate looking for Forest Goers. Last year we didn't see a single cop until we got to Muskegon, and they were getting coffee at the gas station we stopped at to fill up before getting to the line. 

If you're still skeptical about the interstates, instead of taking 65 north of Lafayette, hop off at the final exit for West Lafayette and take IN43/US421. It's a 2-lane country route that will take you up to Michigan City, where you can link up with 94 and US31 to get to Muskegon/Rothbury. 

65 between Indianapolis and Lafayette is a goddamn free-for-all and cops are more concerned about Chicagoans going 95 in a 70 than some car full of camping gear with a GRiZ sticker in the back window. ",5,1749792036.0,ElectricForest,0,1.0,False
1la7xfh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1la7xfh,Questions for Bing Dao farmers?,"Hey pu-heads,

I‚Äôm new to this community and to the world of Pu‚Äôer, but after a surreal experience in Yunnan this spring, I‚Äôm hooked and trying to learn everything I can.

By total luck, I got invited to Bingdao, Lincang ‚Äî a private tea mountain you can only access if you invest in the land co-op or are invited. (Unlike, for example, Xigui which is open to public. And yes, I have photos, WeChat screenshots, GPS coordinates‚Ä¶ all the receipts if you‚Äôre suss.)

I met the village chief, climbed and drank tea from 1000-year-old ancestor tree, joined the farmers‚Äô community dance (taught them how to dance to Kendrick!), and shared a homemade meal of foraged pickled bauhinia flowers, black chicken sour melon soup, tea leaf omelette under solar-powered lights in a completely self-sustaining village. The gushu sheng pu was unreal: sweet, clean, round mouthfeel, euphoric. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt touched teabags since.

I promised the community I‚Äôd help get the word out, even though I‚Äôm not selling anything or getting paid. I want to help people discover good Pu‚Äôer, and maybe help reduce the insane amount of misinformation and hype out there, especially for new drinkers.

So I‚Äôve got a few questions for you all: 
‚Ä¢	What made you fall in love with Pu‚Äôer? 
‚Ä¢	What parts of the market still confuse you or feel shady? 
‚Ä¢	Is gongfu too intimidating for newcomers, or does it add to the ritual? 
‚Ä¢	Have you tried brewing Pu‚Äôer with coffee gear (Chemex, AeroPress, moka espresso pots)? Do you like it or not? 
‚Ä¢	If you could ask Bingdao gushu farmers anything, what would you want to know?

Let‚Äôs get a real conversation going. Happy to share what I saw, tasted, and learned ‚Äî and even pass along questions to the farmers via WeChat.

Thanks for letting me learn from this group.

Here we are again. I‚Äôm exhausted. I had to ask a grown man to do the dishes. He said he would. Nope, he didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll do it in the morning‚Äù‚Ä¶. I guarantee he will not be up in the morning lol. 2 Tupperware containers, 1 coffee cup, 1 water bottle, 1 plate, a few silverware pieces.. that was it. I don‚Äôt understand how he can‚Äôt see how hypocritical he is, lol. He got upset with me tonight bc I didn‚Äôt want to give him a BJ. He works. I work too. I‚Äôm the primary caretaker. I do 95% of the chores. 90% of the mental load lol. 

He turned sex into a transactional action by constantly using the ‚Äúwell I work so I deserve sex‚Äù, maybe not in those exact words but pretty much, during arguments or ‚Äútalks‚Äù. (I put talks in quotations because it‚Äôs really hard to talk to him about this without him completely losing his shit). Sex is no longer this fun thing to do together‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs been turned into something I *have* to do or it feels like all hell breaks loose. 

We just got into a fight not too long ago. I was really really triggered during this fight and acted in ways I hate. (Similarly reflective of my childhood trauma lol) He said some really hurtful things. I found myself caving in because I wanted things to be better (I also was horny, I‚Äôm human I have needs)‚Ä¶.. 1.5 days later and I‚Äôm on my period. I‚Äôm still on it.
He genuinely doesn‚Äôt understand how mentally exhausted I am with this. 

I‚Äôve been exhausted all day. He knows this. It was a decent day. We were just laughing together and hanging out.
Then bam. He makes himself upset by bringing up a BJ. ‚ÄúEven if I did ask I know it wouldn‚Äôt be a possibility‚Äù. *pouts and sighs*

I‚Äôve been house and dog sitting all week. I‚Äôm so tired. Haven‚Äôt been getting good rest because I prioritize a few hours of alone time at night over sleep lol. I have to decompress. I have no space otherwise. The pressure is too much. Idk why I‚Äôm even trying anymore. I was trying to get over the hurtful things he said.. then he shows a glimmer of that tonight out of no where. I‚Äôm anxious. I‚Äôve been anxious dog sitting too. This has been my first time for this friend.. I‚Äôm such a homebody so being at someone else‚Äôs house, taking care of 3 dogs‚Ä¶. 

He didn‚Äôt do anything for me for Mother‚Äôs Day. I literally sobbed all day. No exaggeration. He didn‚Äôt even notice I was crying all day!! He was mad at me and ignoring me (felt like punishment to me) after telling him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex a few nights before‚Ä¶ I had to drive to get my own food. He didn‚Äôt offer to do shit. He didn‚Äôt even utter the words ‚Äúhappy Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù. The day was extra hard because I lost my mom Nov. 30, 2023‚Ä¶ my 2nd Mother‚Äôs Day without her. :( 
When I brought up how hurt I was by his behavior he gaslit the heck outta me. ‚ÄúWell you didn‚Äôt ask me to go get food‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask me to do anything‚Äù blah blah blah. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know you had been crying all day. You didn‚Äôt say anything‚Äù.. well ok. I decided to not be that way and supported my kid celebrating his dad. So we got a gift. Gonna take him to eat or at-least go get our favorite food. He wants so much from me but gives me so little and gets sooooooo mad if when I ‚Äúconstantly point out what he‚Äôs doing wrong‚Äù. I can‚Äôt win here.

The air sat heavy, unmoving.
Power still off.
Heat long gone.

Tiny Tim lay on the couch beneath three layers of blankets that no longer did anything but hold the cold in place. His skin had gone pale. Lips tinged blue. His last breath came hours ago, quiet and without fuss, the way children learn to go when the world forgets them.

Bob Cratchit sat beside him.
One hand on Tim‚Äôs chest.
Still.
Still.
Still.

There was a knock at the door.

No one moved.

Another knock. Louder. Sharper.

Bob opened it.

Ebenezer Scrooge stood in the hallway, coat dry, breath visible. He held a clipboard in one hand and a half-finished cup of coffee in the other.

His eyes scanned the room behind Bob.

‚ÄúI see the matter has resolved itself,‚Äù Scrooge said.

Bob didn‚Äôt speak.

‚ÄúThere is no joy in tragedy,‚Äù Scrooge continued. ‚ÄúBut there is clarity. You were four months behind. The eviction notice was delivered on schedule. The utilities followed.‚Äù

Bob‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Scrooge said.

Silence stretched between them.

Bob looked at the floor. His voice barely held. ‚ÄúThey showed you what would happen. The spirits. You saw him die.‚Äù

Scrooge nodded. ‚ÄúAnd I listened. I studied every moment. I weighed the warnings.‚Äù

He took a slow sip of coffee.

‚ÄúThen I woke up.‚Äù

Scrooge adjusted his gloves, folded the clipboard beneath his arm, and stepped back from the door.

‚ÄúThe locks will be changed by five o‚Äôclock. I suggest you make arrangements before then.‚Äù

Bob shook. ‚ÄúHe was a child.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. And now he‚Äôs a statistic. A smaller draw on public assistance. A lesson, if anyone‚Äôs paying attention.‚Äù

He turned to go.

‚ÄúThere are fewer mouths to feed now.‚Äù

He walked down the hall.
Not fast.
Not smug.
Just certain.

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this. I‚Äôve seen the posts, I‚Äôve laughed (politely), and I‚Äôve kept my distance. But after what happened yesterday‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm begging you ‚Äî please stop calling out strangers in public.

Let me explain.

I was at work, minding my own business in our open-plan office (or, as I like to call it, the battlefield of mediocrity). I was wearing my Rolex GMT-Master II ‚Äî 126710BLRO, bought straight from my AD after three years of ‚Äúrelationship building.‚Äù Do you know how many random diamond necklaces I had to buy? How many empty compliments I had to give about ‚Äúhow great the light plays off the fluting‚Äù? I‚Äôve suffered. I‚Äôve earned this watch.

I was standing by the coffee machine, doing the usual cuff-lift-wrist-twist combo, just casually checking the time in London like any international professional would, when Jason ‚Äî our graphic designer ‚Äî walked up.

Flip-flops. Hoodie. Smells faintly of vape juice and Axe body spray. I assumed he was just going to grab a tea.

Instead, he stops. He stares at my wrist. And then, it happens:

> ‚ÄúDamn. Nice rep, dude. VSF?‚Äù



I blinked. Time stopped. I wasn‚Äôt even sure what a ""VSF"" was. I thought it might be a band or something.

> ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù I said, already feeling the heat rise up my neck.



> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool, man. No shame. They‚Äôre getting really good. I have the same one. Yours is aligned way better than mine though. Respect.‚Äù



He then rolled up his sleeve ‚Äî and revealed his own ‚Äúwatch.‚Äù It looked like mine. Too much like mine. I felt nauseous.

> ‚ÄúYou can always tell from the cyclops under certain lighting,‚Äù he said, tapping my watch. ‚ÄúYours is either a great VSF or you paid waaaay too much at retail.‚Äù



My jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ genuine,‚Äù I managed.

> ‚ÄúSure, sure,‚Äù he said with a wink. ‚ÄúHey, if you ever want a smoother clasp, I know a guy who mods them.‚Äù



A smoother clasp?

I walked back to my desk in silence. I opened a Rolex forum just to feel something. I considered messaging my SA to ask if maybe I‚Äôd been sold a fake. I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt.

By 2pm, I noticed Matt from IT was looking at my wrist suspiciously. By 3pm, someone left a sticky note on my monitor that just said: ‚ÄúNice VSF bro.‚Äù By 4pm, Jason posted a picture of his wrist on Slack captioned: ‚ÄúWhich one‚Äôs the real Pepsi? üëÄ‚Äù

He got 13 reacts.


---

So to the Rep community, I say this with as much grace as I can muster:
Can you please stop ‚Äúspotting‚Äù in the wild?

Not every Pepsi is a rep. Some of us sacrificed entire paychecks, bought necklaces we‚Äôll never wear, and endured years of waitlists for the privilege of checking two time zones. If it looks too good to be fake‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs just earned.

And to Jason in Marketing:
If you ever tap my crystal again, I will file an HR report so detailed your VSF clasp will snap from anxiety.

Respectfully,
An actual Rolex owner

I didn‚Äôt think a small kitchen tool like this would make such a difference, but this digital food thermometer completely changed how I cook meat. Before, I was relying on timing and guesswork, now I just probe and know right away whether it‚Äôs done or not.

The readout is fast, just a few seconds, and accurate. I tested it against a higher-end thermometer I already had, and the readings matched within a degree. The LCD screen is easy to read even outside when I‚Äôm grilling, and it‚Äôs responsive enough that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm waiting around while the steak cools off.

Build-wise, the stainless steel probe feels sturdy and cleans up easily with a quick wipe. I‚Äôve used it for BBQ, baking, checking oil temps, and even for homemade coffee and tea. It‚Äôs lightweight, fits in the drawer, and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap despite the price.

It doesn‚Äôt come with a battery, so you‚Äôll need an LR44 button cell. But once powered up, it‚Äôs super intuitive. No bells and whistles, just a reliable, fast-reading thermometer that actually helps prevent overcooked food.

Great value for anyone who wants better control in the kitchen or by the grill without spending a ton.

* volunteer/director of student run homeless shelter - 1000 hours
* Research: 1200 hours, one lab for 4 years, third author on a published paper, medicine related but not clinical 
* Volunteering at hospital - 50 hours 
* Chain store coffee barista - 700 hours
* Behavior Tech (worked w/ kids with developmental disabilities) - 150 hours
* Shadowing: 100 hours

LORs: 1 stem prof/my lab PI, 1 spanish prof, boss at hospital, advisor for shelter   
(not having a second STEM prof disqualifies me from some schools but I didn't have another option)  
  
PS/Writing: realistically not great but I tried my best

What I'm looking for:   
\#1 absolute criteria is to be in a state that is at least neutral for trans rights. Even if a city/school is liberal, I am unfortunately still at legal risk if the state gov is conservative. I prefer to live in a more urban environment and I feel like I've got enough potential schools on the list to stick to that. I‚Äôm fairly confident that I want to go into pediatrics as a specialty, so it would be good if they had a children's hospital associated w them. 

Schools I already applied to because I really like them even though some are delusional level reaches (i felt like i had to at least try lmao):¬†

* Cornell¬†
* University of Michigan
* UCSF
* UCSD
* UCLA¬†
* UC Irvine
* Stanford
* NYU Grossman
* Northwestern
* Mayo
* Keck
* Kaiser
* Columbia
* Boston University

Schools I like but I haven't applied bc I shouldn‚Äôt apply to more crazy hard schools:

* Icahn 
* NYU Grossman Long Island
   * It sounds amazing but I'm not sure about if this program would fit me. I‚Äôm VERY interested in pediatrics but not sure if I want to do primary care or work in a hospital, leaning towards hospital based on my experiences so far. I just don't want to be locked in to being an outpatient primary care pediatrician bc I can see that not going well for me, but I also have don't completely understand how residency works lol.

Schools I like but don't know if would be worth applying to bc I‚Äôm OOS:

* University of Colorado
* University of Massachusetts¬†
* University of Maryland
* SUNY Downstate¬†
* Stony Brook¬†
* Buffalo¬†
* Rutgers New Jersey Newark
* ‚Äã‚ÄãRutgers Robert Wood Johnson

Schools I like but am not 100% sure about yet:

* Tufts 
* Hofstra/Northwell
* Arizona (Phoenix)
* Arizona (Tuscon)¬†
* Sidney Kimmel
* Rush
* Temple
* Drexel
   * have seen some concerns about this one bc they don't have their own hospital and the sites can be far apart, but idk how much I should take that into consideration 
* Rosalind Franklin

Schools I don't know much about or am unsure about the location, but mildly interested:

* University of Illinois
   * I‚Äôm only interested in the Chicago campus and they seem to assign people after acceptance, so if I get assigned to a different one and do not want to go there (assuming a case where this is my only acceptance) that would be really bad
* Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine¬†
* University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine¬†
* Cooper¬†
* Geisinger Commonwealth
* Quinnipiac
* George Washington University
* Rochester
* Oakland University William Beaumont SOM
* Vermont

For those who remember me, what‚Äôs up OG‚Äôs. Anyways, been on the healing journey for exactly a year now. It‚Äôs been a wild roller coaster of emotions and changing diets and supplements and gathering information and seeing what‚Äôs right and wrong and what works and doesn‚Äôt etc etc etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 

I started June 1st of last year. Ate nothing but fruit and herbs for 2 months, became too malnourished, had an outbreak, and had to go back to eating normal again. Started becoming weak and almost fainting if I stood up too fast and my libido was so bad and I was too skinny. Fruits and herbs were and are not the answer.

Then a friend and I were searching for more truth and maybe other cures, and this is how we manifested Darko and his protocol and the proper information about the human body and how it works inside and out. I knew after a week of reading and asking him 100 different questions that this protocol was the right thing to do. It all finally made sense after months and months of being misguided and guessing and thinking we were on the right track and knew what to do.

August - December I was super strict on the protocol and never had and outbreaks and felt amazing. January - April I was cheating a little too often (nicotine, coffee, alcohol) but my diet was still flawless. Didn‚Äôt matter though cause I got an outbreak each month‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Since May I‚Äôve been strict again and also started ingesting 35% food grade HP to oxygenate my body to help the process and I can say with confidence that you will not die as we‚Äôve been told üòÇüôèüèº So far also no outbreaks. 

I figured out two interesting things recently. 

1. HSV is not a virus, parasite, disease, etc. It is a toxic poison that was created and spread by the elites in the late 1900‚Äôs to poison the world and fuck with us. And it‚Äôs a pretty strong poison that may take 1-2 years to detox out the body, depending on how overall toxic you are already as a human being. 

2. The only reason we get outbreaks is not because ‚Äúthe virus is active all the sudden‚Äù lmfao, it‚Äôs cause our body is trying to cleanse out the poison, and if our blood is already too toxic to begin with, then the body can‚Äôt handle all the toxicity so it must use the tissues (our skin) to purge it out in the area that it manifested in the first place AKA your mouth or genitals. If you keep your blood clean by following the protocol, you will experience no more outbreaks (possibly one more) while also slowly cleansing out HSV permanently over time. And I have already experienced this since I had no outbreaks for 4 months while doing the protocol.

Feels good, after a year of digging, finally manifesting the truth I have been seeking, and how simple yet complex the human body is. But once you understand, you REALLY start to see things and be like ‚Äúdamn why did I think that‚Äù lol. We‚Äô d been lied too about everything. I knew once I‚Äôve gone through everything and tried everything I could save  everyone who‚Äôs trying to cure this so much time and effort and even money. And here we are still on the journey, just embracing it for what it is. Still have a little more time left to go I believe.

I had a friend tell me that I‚Äôm just being too desperate on trying to cure this and that I am wasting my time and that God has scarred me for life. Now of course he‚Äôs wrong about the desperate part, cause I have fully accepted that I have HSV, but I have also fully accepted the truth about what it takes to be able to cleanse it out the body and cure myself, which is discipline and time. Not giving up when times are tough. Being able to resist temptations. Claiming victory in the end for all the hard work.

Now the God part struck me hard and made me think, because that‚Äôs an interesting statement he made, but personally, I believe God punished me for the sexual decisions I have made in my life, sure, but has also given me a chance to make things right by giving me more truth to life and how to cure the human body that our souls have been given. It‚Äôs almost as simple as just knowing that we‚Äôve been lied too about how we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt cure this. You can. Don‚Äôt listen to those mother fuckers who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about.

HSV is a blessing in disguise, as crazy as that sounds. It‚Äôs a road block that we for some reason manifested in our life that we must overcome. Everyone has different road blocks in their life, and for us, it‚Äôs HSV. Sure it fucking sucks no one wants this shit but suck it up and get to cleansing. We got work to do. 

I‚Äôll be continuing going hard this summer with the Darko protocol (Self Healers Protocol is what it‚Äôs called) and also ingesting the 35% food grade HP which honestly I believe is a huge help. My body is naturally producing good amounts of GCMAF, getting all the nutrients it needs to heal from raw, high vibrating foods humans were meant to eat, ingesting plasma for the minerals, cleaning the blood through plasma, and oxygenating the body through the food grade HP. Everything is in check, but honestly the only thing I‚Äôm missing (which isn‚Äôt required but can speed up the process) is fasting. Which I need to start incorporating, but it must be minimum 48+ hours of fasting or the benefits will be slim to none. 72 hours recommended once every other week (I know sounds like a lot but).

Stay strong my friends. You‚Äôre not alone. 

Peace.

Do you have any checklists for you shift on what to do in your downtime?

Do you walk arond the property and make notes of anything we need maintenance help?

Do you try to check the bathrooms or clean the lobby every shift?

Do you check guest laundry, fitness center, can you wipe down the lobby vacuum? 

Can you make copies of welcome sheets and cut them? 

What can you do during your shift to help the next shift?

can you fill bottles of soap shampoo and body wash? 

Can you take out the trash in and around the lobby?

Can you clean the coffee maker and make sure it‚Äôs full?

Pool towels?

Fill the market?

Make plates with napkins for breakfast?

That morning, I was just at flat, hair messy, oversized t-shirt, no makeup, not even thinking about looking nice. I was making coffee and humming some random tune when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror on the fridge door. And I paused.

I didn‚Äôt look perfect. My hair was doing that wave thing it does when I sleep on one side too long, and I had that sleepy face I always try to hide. But something felt‚Ä¶ soft. Familiar. I smiled a little, not because of how I looked, but because of how I *felt*. There was no one to impress, no outfit to fix, it was just me.

I walked back to my room, still barefoot, and sat cross-legged on the bed. I looked at myself in my little wall mirror, the one that‚Äôs kind of crooked, and whispered, ‚ÄúYou look pretty today.‚Äù It made me laugh at first, like, who says that to themselves out loud? But I did. And I meant it.

That moment stuck with me more than any perfect outfit or compliment. It reminded me that feeling beautiful doesn‚Äôt always come from outside. Sometimes, it sneaks up on you when you least expect it, when you‚Äôre soft, when you‚Äôre gentle with yourself, when you‚Äôre not trying so hard.

Hisashi doesn't look human; he's actually a heteromorph. He resembles a humanoid mouse, with cobra-like hood-like ears and long whiskers. He has membranes on his arms similar to those of flying squirrels, although they look like bat wings. This causes him trouble walking, as he always steps on them and falls.

Hisashi is completely blind and has no eyes (Yes he is Izuku's biological father).

Hisashi lives busy with the funeral home and often talks about his work in an extremely frightening way.

""Oh, you're my son's 'teacher,' right?"" **Hisashi smiles at the wall, but Inko moves him so he's face to face with Aizawa, but Hisashi still doesn't see anything.**

""Inko works as an accountant, and you?"" **Aizawa says while Present Mic drinks coffee.**

""Uh... excuse me?"" **Present Mic says, scared as he spitted his coffee on Aizawa face.**

""... the funeral home,"" **Inko says, smiling, nervous that her husband and his eccentricities will ruin this.**

Hisashi traumatized Bakugou (this prevented bullying).

Inko is Nana's daughter, so when Izuku met her grandmother, Nana wondered how the hell her daughter married the weirdo of the classroom.

Inko met Hisashi because of a bet. She had to choose between dating the richest and most arrogant boy in her high school or... the weirdo. (Inko chose the weirdo.)

Hisashi always makes scary metaphors about corpses, the morgue, and the funeral home. (Hisashi's whole family is like that.)

""And you will embrace in the eternal silence and cold of death, where souls rest in peace in the eternal cold embrace of death."" **Hisashi smiles at Izuku.**
