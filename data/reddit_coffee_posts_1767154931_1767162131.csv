The main one for me is be a little more judicious with my coffee buying.

I'm hoping to only buy when something special is released and instead whittle down my freezer reserves.

1q05s12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q05s12,What happened to Soundon distribution?,"So lately they haven’t been approving my releases, claiming that they need proof that I’m allowed to use whatever samples are in my songs (royalty-free) and claiming that my songs are unfinished. And I have sent them proof multiple times telling them that I am allowed to use those samples and that they are full instrumentals or full tracks. Some I have been telling them about for a year and they still haven’t fixed it. And some of them my emails they just straight up don’t respond to. They also haven’t been sending out royalty splits to the people that I’ve been working with. They haven’t sent some of my music to Instagram or Snapchat. And now they just won’t respond properly to my emails. They’ve been telling me to send a TikTok ticket. Although the website is owned by TikTok, I don’t see how sending a ticket to their app is gonna work and they didn’t respond anyway. They keep claiming that I use a VPN and they couldn’t determine where I am when that was never an issue before and they didn’t respond when I sent them where I was. They are also just not active at all on their Twitter account. They also recently started charging multiple versions of sounds on TikTok and charging you to release the sound before the song comes out when before that was all free. In fact, the website being free was their main appeal (that’s not really a main issue, but I thought I would bring it up). Do y’all have any advice because I don’t really have any famous music friends that’ll help me get in contact with anybody. Also, in case you’re wondering why I don’t switch to another distributor. This is the only one that lets you upload the entire song on TikTok instead of just a one minute bit and one of my songs they actually did approve was a 10 minute instrumental. It is so far my most popular song with 20K uses on TikTok and 2.5K streams on Spotify. So obviously I want to keep doing the thing that’s making me popular. Also, before I get any accusations, no I am not an AI/bot. No, I don’t make AI music. I don’t even use the AI album covers that they offer. In fact I had to email another distributor to confirm that I don’t use AI in my music. Also, please do not be condescending and say “just be more original.” If you’re not gonna be helpful or supportive, I would appreciate if you don’t comment.

TL, DR: Soundon keeps rejecting my releases, claiming issues with royalty free samples or saying my songs are unfinished, even though I have sent proof almost every time. They keep ignoring my emails, haven’t paid out royalty splits, and failed to put my music on Instagram and Snapchat. They now claim I am using a VPN and push me to submit TikTok tickets that they don’t respond to. I have not switched distributors because this is the only one that allows full songs on TikTok, which has helped me grow (10 min instrumental, 20K TikTok uses).

We currently own:

Pixel Phone 2 iPhones echo show 11 3 ring alarm key pads 1 ring doorbell Dozen ring contact sensors Maybe some other ring alarm stuff. Shield TV pro Decent 3 year old Windows PC with 1TB HD, not used for much.

Few first gen Alexa speakers and first gen show.

TVs are mixed but I like googles tv UI the best so my future TVs will be Android based.

None of this besides the ring system is really set up to do anything.

Using this as my base to build around I think I'm trying to decide between googles or Amazon's ecosystem. I'm planning to add:

A couple hubs Thermostats 4(leaning ecobee) Smoke alarms 1 wired floodlight camera 6 or so other outdoor cameras (will likely be battery) Smart motorized blinds Lights Smart plugs Smart lock (yale) A few more smart speakers/displays. Idk what else. My appliances are smart but never touched them.

More about me: I love my pixel phone. I use my Google account to synch with as much as I can. Gemini atm is my favorite AI. I can barely operate the iPhones.

I Hate the Alexa App, Prime UI, and Fire TV. The echo show looks and sounds great though and my daughter prefers that to listen to music. If the Alexa Hubs replace having to use the app with better UI this might be less an issue.

Ring alarm is nice, works and I'm already set up...Local storage would be preferable and nice but not over convenience.

I'm not really on a budget.

My priority list. 1. Security system, cameras convenience for all us to use as few apps as possible. Central hubs that will control and organize view cameras. (Local storage is cool if it's easy, but I'm probably going to be paying for ring security anyway) Convenience. I'll be the main user with the pixel phone but the iPhone users play around some.

Quality of products I'd rather have premium stuff but only if it's all going to work together.

Entertainment/quality of life Our online focus is streaming, music, Amazon shopping, ordering food social media.

Automation. Won't be doing much...blinds, lights, coffee. Maybe some simple stuff.

So based on what I have and what I want to do should I keep buying into the Alexa/ring ecosystem. Or switch to Google/nest. Or other The ring alarm system id like to not replace.

Response:

Gemini: Building a smart home for a 4-story, 3,000 sq/ft townhouse requires a strategic ""brain"" to ensure everything talks to each other. Given your deep love for the Pixel, Gemini, and Google TV, you are essentially a ""Google-first"" user living in an ""Amazon-wired"" house (Ring/Echo).

​Here is the breakdown of how to navigate this conflict without losing your mind or your security system.​The Verdict: The ""Google Brain"" with a ""Ring Backbone""​Since you hate the Alexa app and love Gemini/Google UI, you should make Google Home your primary interface. However, because you already have a full Ring alarm system (which is excellent) and don't want to replace it, you will run a ""Hybrid"" setup.

​1. Security & Cameras (The Ring Conflict)​Ring and Google are fierce rivals. You cannot natively view Ring camera feeds on a Google Nest Hub or Google TV.​The Compromise: Keep the Ring Alarm for the sensors and professional monitoring. It is one of the most reliable systems and you’re already set up.​The Hub Strategy: * Put a Google Nest Hub Max in the kitchen/living area for your ""Daily Driver"" (calendars, Gemini, YouTube, controlling lights).​Put an Echo Hub (Amazon’s new wall-mounted control panel) or keep your Echo Show 15 specifically as a ""Security Station."" The Echo Hub has a much better UI than the Alexa app and is designed specifically for Ring dashboarding.​New Cameras: If you want to see your new 6 cameras on your Google TVs and Nest Hubs, buy Nest Cams. Mixing brands is okay: Ring for the alarm/doorbell, Nest for the new outdoor floodlights and battery cams.

​2. Thermostats: The Ecobee Win​You mentioned Ecobee, and you are 100% correct to lean that way.​Why: Ecobee is ""ecosystem agnostic."" It works perfectly with Google Home, Alexa, and even Apple HomeKit (for the iPhone users in the house).​Townhouse Tip: With 4 stories, buy the Ecobee Premium for the main floors and use Ecobee Remote Sensors on every level to ensure the HVAC isn't overworking one floor while freezing another.

​3. Recommended Premium Hardware List​Since budget isn't the primary constraint, focus on Matter-compatible devices. Matter is a new standard that allows devices to work in Google, Alexa, and Apple apps simultaneously.

Entertainment & QoL​The Pixel/Gemini Edge: Since you use Gemini, get a Google TV Streamer (4K) for your main TVs. It has a built-in ""Home Panel"" that lets you control your lights and see your (Nest) cameras right on the TV screen.​Music: Since your daughter loves the Echo for music, keep it! You can have a Google-controlled house and still let her say ""Alexa, play Taylor Swift"" in her room.​Your Strategy for the 4-Story Layout:​Floor 1 (Entry/Garage): Ring Keypad + Nest Cam (Outdoor) + Smart Lock.​Floor 2 (Kitchen/Living): Google Nest Hub Max (Your main station) + Nest Doorbell.​Floor 3 (Bedrooms): Small Nest Minis for voice control + Ecobee Sensors.​Floor 4 (Office/Den): Google TV Streamer + Nest Mini.​Next Step​To avoid the Alexa App ""clutter"" while keeping your Ring Alarm, would you like me to find a Matter-compatible Smart Lock or Smart Blinds that specifically bridge the gap between your Pixel and the rest of the family's iPhones?",0,1767161465.0,homeautomation,0,0.5,False

1q05pbr,https://v.redd.it/ugo7yocsdhag1,Is this channeling? [Simplus EM3101/900N-TQ grinder],"I’m using a Simplus machine for now - the pressure and water volume is not adjustable. I have tried multiple grind sizes on my grinder (a Chinese 900N-TQ, probably a knockoff) but cannot seem to get a correct brew ratio. The result is almost always sour tasting coffee.

For the grinder, the manufacturer recommends 2.5-3 for espresso. I have tried the following combination to always end up around 40-50g coffee (manually stopped).

Summarising around 60+ data points:

Coarseness 3, around 14g dose, 45-50g coffee, sour

Coarseness 2, around 13g dose, 40-45g coffee, sour

Coarseness 1 (a step down from above), around 14g dose, 15g-22g coffee, bitter

I have changed to using a bottomless portafilter basket for this machine, and am using a fork in place of WDT + leveller and tamper for puck prep with a puck screen.

I was on Day 471 of posting daily on LinkedIn. Sounds impressive, right?

Here's what nobody saw: I'd spent the last 90 minutes rewriting the same post. Seven different versions. Each one felt... wrong.

Not terrible. Just mediocre. And mediocre on LinkedIn is invisible.

I finally published version #4 out of exhaustion. Woke up to 23 likes. Half were bots. The other half were probably people who liked it by accident while scrolling.

**That's when it hit me.**

I'd been doing this for 471 days. I should be *better* at this by now. But every single night felt like the first time. The same anxiety. The same second-guessing. The same ""is this good enough?"" spiral.

# The Problem Nobody Talks About

Everyone tells you to ""be consistent on LinkedIn.""

Post daily. Build authority. Provide value. Be authentic.

Cool. But here's what they don't tell you:

**The gap between writing a post and writing a post that actually lands is invisible to you when you're staring at your own words.**

You read your draft. It makes sense to you. But you wrote it, so of course it does.

You have no idea if:

* The hook will make someone stop scrolling
* The middle part rambles or flows
* The ending inspires action or just... ends
* Your ""unique insight"" sounds like everyone else's unique insight

So you publish and pray. Some posts hit. Most don't. You never really know why.

# The Moment Everything Changed

Day 683. I'm sitting with my co-founder at a coffee shop.

He asks, ""How long did your post take today?""

""About 40 minutes,"" I say.

""How much of that was writing?""

""Maybe 10 minutes.""

""And the other 30?""

""...Staring at it. Wondering if it's good.""

He laughs. ""What if you could just... ask something? Like, 'Hey, is this hook strong enough?' and get an instant answer?""

I stared at him.

That was it. That was the tool I'd been wishing existed for 683 days.

# Building My Own Truth Mirror

I didn't want another AI writing assistant that generates posts for you.

I wanted something that would read *my* writing and tell me the truth. Brutally. Specifically. Usefully.

So we started building.

**Week 1:** I fed it 200+ of my own posts. Winners and losers. I labeled what worked and what flopped.

**Week 2:** We analyzed patterns. Emotional hooks, structural rhythm, clarity, call-to-actions that actually converted vs. ones that died.

**Week 3:** The first prototype roasted one of my posts so accurately I laughed out loud in a quiet library. It called out my vague opening line, pointed out where I lost the thread, and flagged my ""reach out to learn more"" ending as ""lazy and forgettable.""

It was perfect.

# What [postautopsy](http://postautopsy.com/) Actually Does (The Real Features)

Think of it as your brutally honest editor who's read 10,000 LinkedIn posts and knows exactly what works.

**Before you hit publish, it shows you:**

**1. Hook Strength Analysis** Your opening line gets scored. ""I'm excited to announce"" = instant fail. ""Day 683: I stared at a blank post for 47 minutes"" = now we're talking.

**2. Story Structure Check** Are you rambling? Jumping around? Losing focus halfway through? It maps your narrative arc and shows you where readers will drop off.

**3. Clarity Scanner** Flags corporate jargon, vague statements, and confusing sentences. Suggests sharper alternatives. No more ""leveraging synergies"" garbage.

**4. Engagement Prediction** Based on patterns from high-performing posts, it predicts whether your post will resonate or disappear into the void.

**5. The Roast (My Favorite Feature)** Sometimes you need to hear the truth. ""This post is 8 paragraphs of setup for a point you could've made in 2 sentences."" Harsh. Accurate. Necessary.

**6. Instant Rewrites** Doesn't just criticize shows you how to fix weak sections with examples. It's like having a co-writer who's already seen what works.

# The Result?

My posts used to take 40 minutes. Now they take 15.

It is one of the most reliable systems and you’re already set up.​The Hub Strategy: * Put a Google Nest Hub Max in the kitchen/living area for your ""Daily Driver"" (calendars, Gemini, YouTube, controlling lights).​Put an Echo Hub (Amazon’s new wall-mounted control panel) or keep your Echo Show 15 specifically as a ""Security Station."" The Echo Hub has a much better UI than the Alexa app and is designed specifically for Ring dashboarding.​New Cameras: If you want to see your new 6 cameras on your Google TVs and Nest Hubs, buy Nest Cams. Mixing brands is okay: Ring for the alarm/doorbell, Nest for the new outdoor floodlights and battery cams.

​2. Thermostats: The Ecobee Win​You mentioned Ecobee, and you are 100% correct to lean that way.​Why: Ecobee is ""ecosystem agnostic."" It works perfectly with Google Home, Alexa, and even Apple HomeKit (for the iPhone users in the house).​Townhouse Tip: With 4 stories, buy the Ecobee Premium for the main floors and use Ecobee Remote Sensors on every level to ensure the HVAC isn't overworking one floor while freezing another.

​3. Recommended Premium Hardware List​Since budget isn't the primary constraint, focus on Matter-compatible devices. Matter is a new standard that allows devices to work in Google, Alexa, and Apple apps simultaneously.

Entertainment & QoL​The Pixel/Gemini Edge: Since you use Gemini, get a Google TV Streamer (4K) for your main TVs. It has a built-in ""Home Panel"" that lets you control your lights and see your (Nest) cameras right on the TV screen.​Music: Since your daughter loves the Echo for music, keep it! You can have a Google-controlled house and still let her say ""Alexa, play Taylor Swift"" in her room.​Your Strategy for the 4-Story Layout:​Floor 1 (Entry/Garage): Ring Keypad + Nest Cam (Outdoor) + Smart Lock.​Floor 2 (Kitchen/Living): Google Nest Hub Max (Your main station) + Nest Doorbell.​Floor 3 (Bedrooms): Small Nest Minis for voice control + Ecobee Sensors.​Floor 4 (Office/Den): Google TV Streamer + Nest Mini.
​Next Step​To avoid the Alexa App ""clutter"" while keeping your Ring Alarm, would you like me to find a Matter-compatible Smart Lock or Smart Blinds that specifically bridge the gap between your Pixel and the rest of the family's iPhones?",1,1767160873.0,googlehome,0,1.0,False
1q05i8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WalgreensStores/comments/1q05i8t/dear_all_managers_no_youre_not_being_reasonable/,"Dear ALL managers, NO, you're not being reasonable","It's not reasonable to expect your cashier to run a marathon during her 8 hour shift. Running between 8 aisles, and putting away totes, and then running back when some passive aggressive asshole customer starts screaming because you aren't behind the register is anything but a reasonable request, especially when you also expect us to run back and forth and answer the phone, while running back and forth for fed ex, while running back and forth for photo etc...  And I'm sick of stores thinking this is a reasonable request. 

  
The front cashier gets paid the least amount of money of anyone at the store yet were expected to do 10 things at once but yet your fat ass can't even scan the Fed-ex package for the customer standing right in front of you because you walked behind the photo counter to get your coffee, so you call me from aisle one where I'm on my knees facing the bottom shelf (at your request) a good 15 feet from where YOU are standing.

Today, it was me and my store manager all day. He wouldn't come up for IC3s. He made me wait for Pharmacy to close for lunch so one of them could cover my lunch (At 1.30 when I was scheduled to leave at 2.30)

 At a different time, I had a line of 10 people and I asked the next customer,  a lady with a Fed-Ex package to go to him because he had the only Zebra in his hands and you know what he did, he looked at her and WALKED AWAY, and put the Zebra on my counter as he walked by the 10 people standing there.

Store Managers are out of touch with reality. Your front cashier is a human being, what she isn't is Eliud  ""F'IN""  Kipchoge.

1q05gfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q05gfv,My small business,"Hello everyone!!
Since I’m posting here for the first time, a little introduction about myself.

I’m Tayyibah, a 23 year old student who is going to start her last semester in college, and after a few months I’ll be in corporate. I have always wanted to do something of my own, even if it’s something small, and since I love baking, I really want to start with selling baked goodies. I bake a lot of things, but for now I’m only starting with:

1. Oats choco chip cookies
2. Cheesecake (not the usual one, the one I make is a bit different) but really, really yum.

I’ve got 2 orders till now, but it’s hard getting customers, which is why I thought of posting here.

I live in Ulwe, and I can take orders from anywhere in Navi Mumbai (Seawoods, Belapur, Kharghar, Panvel, etc.).

I’m also attaching pictures of the sweets. The presentation isn’t the best, but trust me, they taste really good 🙈.

If you would like to order, you can DM me on Instagram — my account is tayyibahqazii.
Or you can comment here as well, and I’ll reach out.

I haven’t created a separate business account because this is not something I’m planning to do for a long time. I just have time right now since I’m only studying, but once I start working in a few months, I won’t be able to take orders, which is why I don’t want to bother creating a new page 😶‍🌫️.

Also, if anyone has any ideas on how I can promote my business apart from Instagram, feel free to share <3

The oats choco chip cookies are healthy and a good quick breakfast or snack option, plus they taste great too.

and about the cheesecake unlike the usual heavy cheesecakes, mine is light, creamy, perfectly sweet and topped with a caramel coffee layer.

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.

 

2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.

  

3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.

4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 

5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay

6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 

  

7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  

 

8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".

 

9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 

  

10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 

11. About s\\\*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s\\\*x, you'll realise that casual s\\\*x is not what you want. S\\\*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  

 

12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH\\\*T WHERE YOU EAT.   

13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 

 

14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu\\\*ks you up by fu\\\*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 

15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.

16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  

 

17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 

  

18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.

19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 

20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  

21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 

Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 

more out of money, time, energy). 

All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿

P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   

Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 

Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: \\\*\\\*I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.\\\*\\\*",15,1767160375.0,CATpreparation,3,0.94,False

I think about where you are now, your state, your life, and I even caught myself wondering what it would be like to apply there for a while, just to see if some ridiculous, magical coincidence might happen. Maybe one morning, on my way to class, I’d bump into you. And we’d have a cup of coffee to catch up and talk about all that has happened. 

When we used to talk every day, there were moments when I felt truly seen by you. Or maybe I imagined it. I saw you too, at least I thought I did. Now that we don’t talk anymore, I’m not so sure.

Over the years we were friends, I imagined so many versions of us. I’ve replayed your face so many times in my head that I know every fleck of color in your eyes. I know how strange that sounds. Still, I reread our old texts more often than I should, just reliving conversations, overanalyzing them, and trying to interpret what you meant.

I think about all the possibilities that never quite happened.

It feels absurd to admit this, but every time you sent one of those messages that could be interpreted a dozen different ways, I’d feel anxiety, excitement, butterflies all tangled together. I could never tell if you felt anything back. All I knew was that I liked you. Completely.

We haven’t spoken in a year now. I just wanted to check in, in the way I never will, and to ask something I never asked when it mattered:

That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 

Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. 

P.S: \*\*I'll soon do another ""2 cents"" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this ""2 cents"" for the ones who've or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I'm amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.\*\*",4,1767160293.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False
1q05e88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1q05e88/day_1_i_made_it_more_difficult_on_purpose/,Day 1. I made it more difficult on purpose.,"I have been smoking since I was around 9-10 years old, and I am now 27 years old. For as long as I can remember I've smoked around 20 or so a day. 

Has anyone else forced their first day to be tougher on purpose? I think making the first day tougher than ever makes for a good reason to look forward to the following days challenges. I grew up very rough, and I find my mental strength with anything is always tougher to break when things are more difficult than expected. It gives me a better reason to fight something I don't want to lose at. I wanted to experience the FULL urge to have a smoke, and happily refuse it.

I dont drink often, but when I do, I smoke a lot. So this morning, I had breakfast, had coffee, and poured a glass of whiskey on the rocks and sat outside where I have my morning smokes and feed the native birds. (I don't have an issue with drinking, and this is not a replacement. Just a cigarette trigger, on top of the morning cigarette trigger, on top of the coffee and bird feeding cigarette trigger).

To make things one bit harder for myself, I also purchased the carton of smokes couple hours ago from the shops today that my housemate was going to get after work.


This was at 8am. It is now near 4 PM here. 

Tomorrow, I will not have a drink, because today I've proved even the strongest of triggers didn't get me to grab a cigarette. Tomorrow, I will keep as busy as I did today, without introducing as many triggers as I did today.

Wish me luck. And good luck to you!",1,1767160282.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

We started in Barcelona, drove down the coast to Granada, then up to Madrid, stopping at Toledo along the way. 

I have been a fervent Sony shooter for years, first with an a6000 as I was transitioning over to mirrorless from Canon and Nikon FF DSLRs. Then I got my a7Riii which has been my workhorse for years. I also recently upgraded the a6000 to an a6100 in a desperate attempt to make it a GR for pocketing and walking around without the bigger gear. 

Eventually, I bit the bullet and grabbed a GRiiix. I am so so glad I did. I take it everywhere. With a young child, it now sits in my pocket for trips to museums, train rides, car shows, out to dinner in interesting parts of the city, to coffee shops and bookstores. I shoot so much more because it's on me constantly. 

What surprised me, though, was how useful I found it while traveling. I am very used to lugging my a7Riii around and had recently swapped to a 20-70/4 lens which I enjoy immensely. But convenience can't be beat, and the GR takes stunning photos. I found that 75-80% of the time in Spain, even when I was fully prepared to take out the Sony, even with my toddler back at home with my in-laws, in the mindset to ""really shoot"", I found myself grabbing the Ricoh, throwing it in my jacket pocket, and heading out to enjoy the city instead of worrying about my Sony sitting on a table taking up space when we'd stop for coffee or drinks. 

I'm in love. My Sony has its time and place, for sure, but what a purchase this has turned out to be! ",10,1767160096.0,ricohGR,0,1.0,False

I (27F) have been seeing this guy since early Dec. We have been on 2 official dates. 

Date 1: grabbed coffee then went to a bar and had drinks. We held hands and he kissed me. In between date 1 & 2 we FaceTimed twice. 

Date 2: took me to an arcade, went for a late lunch, then went back to his place to “watch a movie” but had sex, then he cooked me dinner and we cuddled and talked about some deeper topics. 

That was just before the holidays, we both had busy holiday plans with our family/friends, so we haven’t seen each other since like Dec 20, but there’s been consistent communication. He has called me before bed 2 times since then and our 3rd date is in a few days.

Anyways he planned the 3rd date already (grabbing dinner and doing a fun activity) but he said if I’m okay with it we could go back to his place and I can sleep over. I said that would be great. We live about an hour away by public transit and I live with my family, so it would be nice to just stay over. 

Okay but here’s my dilemma. This is the first time I’ll have slept over at a man’s place. What do I bring? What do I do? I’m going on a date so I can’t even bring like a big bag, so I need to fit everything in my everyday purse cause I don’t wanna lug around a big bag on our date. And is there anything I should know before staying over? He has 2 roommates but they aren’t friends. Anyways, any advice is appreciated.

I really like him.

I've been quite enjoying my time with her, but their has always been this weird thorn in our relationship that I've been puzzled with.

I still live with my parents while going to school, but my girlfriend lives not on campus but rather with two other roommates just across from campus. She can be quite busy and spends a great amount of time working, studying, and crunching up numbers for expenses. She has some assistance from her parents, but the degree of which I am uncertain of.

She always seems a little stressed out, but I try to help her as best as I can. I check-in every day whether in-person or text, I offer to buy little things like a morning coffee, I even study with her even if our majors are wildly different from one another. I've been to her place a few times and I've noticed it's a bit messy and I've suggested the offer of having me clean up her room just so it's tidy. Heck I have offered that I'd welcome her to my home to have a nicer dinner instead of microwaved meals.

I have a part-time job that I work along with studying and earn about $200 a week which is probably less than many in my area, but I save up often, I don't have a car but I do use my dads (& license ofc), or public transportation to get where I need to go. My parents have carpooled me on occasion which I have found incredibly helpful at times especially on inconspicuous occasions. I have good grades, work out or at least walk outside every single day, I try to maintain hobbies that I can grow from and try to make an interesting character out of myself. I don't hangout with a lot of friends, so I consider myself often available for her.

But alas, I've been implied to not be mature enough to understand life as I do not pay rent, or have to worry about finances to much, or don't really do a lot period. I understand her, but it does hurt me because I feel like I am trying to help her as much as I can within reason. I am not going to split my paycheck to her, and I don't want to move in with her either, but I like her and I want to make sure she is secured. She does have an active social life and goes to parties and other crowded events with friends in which I don't, so maybe it's just different social compatibility issues? I might be looking to deep into it.

Anyways, I need help to either understand what I might be doing wrong, or if I just really am not mature enough for her.",8,1767159365.0,Advice,6,0.9,False

1q05159,https://v.redd.it/lp5eeidb7hag1,Short Story: Shadows of the Holy Land,"Cole Sullivan strode into the cavernous debriefing room at CIA headquarters in Langley, his Marine Corps posture unbending even in civilian clothes. At forty-eight he still cut an imposing figure—tall, broad-shouldered, with neatly peppered hair and ice-blue eyes that missed nothing. Three weeks ago he'd been assigned to desk duty; now, after intercepting chatter about a sleeper cell primed for a devastating attack in Israel, he was back on the front line.

Director Reynolds gave him the rundown: an Islamist network, deeply embedded, had secured explosives and planned near-simultaneous strikes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Israelis’ domestic security service, Shin Bet, was stretched thin. The CIA was offering support: surveillance drones, signal intercepts, a small contingent of American operatives under Sullivan’s command. By nightfall, Cole was boarding a red-eye to Tel Aviv.

———

Touching down at Ben Gurion Airport before dawn, Sullivan was met by Shachar Levi, chief of Shin Bet. A lean man in his early fifties, Levi exuded quiet confidence. Behind him stood an elite commando team—eight operators in discreet black fatigues, rifles slung at rest.

“Agent Sullivan,” Levi said, extending a hand. “Welcome to Israel.”

Moments later, Levi ushered Sullivan into a secure briefing room. Maps, satellite photographs, and intercepted cell-phone recordings plastered the walls. “The cell is about to move on Jerusalem,” Levi explained. “We know only one of their key lieutenants: Hassan al-Amiri. He’s believed to be coordinating from Lod. We need to find him before he triggers the detonators.”

Sullivan studied the charts. “What about a local partner?”

Levi nodded. “I’ve arranged someone. Hadas Nativ, a top field agent. You two will run point.”

Before Cole could respond, the door opened, and in walked Hadas Nativ. She was striking: raven-black hair pulled into a tight braid, dark eyes that flicked over him with both curiosity and wariness. At twenty-eight, she was a decade younger but every inch the professional—lean, strong, and visibly restless.

“Agent Sullivan,” she said, offering a firm nod. Her accent was crisp, American-tinged after years abroad. “I look forward to working with you.”

Cole inclined his head. “Likewise.”

As they reviewed the intel, tension crackled. Hadas argued for a cautious, intelligence-led infiltration; Sullivan pressed for rapid action—he’d learned in the Marines to seize the initiative. Neither would back down. By the time their commando backup arrived, the air between them was as charged as the explosives they hunted.

———

Under cover of night, Sullivan, Hadas, and the Israeli team moved into Lod. The apartment building where Hassan al-Amiri was thought to hide stood three blocks from the bustling downtown market. Sullivan’s CIA techs had hacked the intercom; they slipped inside, rifles at low ready.

The operation unraveled almost immediately. A guard spotted a reflection of torchlight. Gunfire erupted in the narrow corridor. Sullivan dove behind a pillar, return-firing as Hadas flanked left, dispatching a second guard with a clean headshot. The commandos stormed in: two upstairs to secure the suspected safe room, the rest pinning down remaining hostiles.

Sullivan cleared the corner into a small living room. A panic-stricken family huddled on a couch. At the far end, a door stood ajar. Beyond it, he could hear the unmistakable click of a locked safe. He kicked it open; inside lay a handful of cellphone-triggered detonators, wires arranged like a spider’s web.

Hadas tapped in codes on her iPad, cross-checking coordinates. “He’s not here,” she murmured. “He got away.”

Sullivan’s gut clenched. “We need another lead—fast.”

They swept the apartment and recovered CCTV footage. An underground parking garage showed Hassan slipping into a black sedan. The tracker on his phone blinked in the city center. Hadas relayed the info. There was a lull in the street noise—too quiet.

Suddenly, masked gunmen poured into the building. They pressed in from both ends of the hallway. Sullivan and Hadas dove back to back, trading suppressive fire. Over the burst-fire, Hadas managed to slide beside him, her presence steadying. Together, they fought through, forcing the attackers back and clearing an exit.

They piled into the commandos’ SUVs and roared off into the night, racing to the city center. Once there, they spotted the black sedan, engine idling by a Lidl supermarket. Sullivan and Hadas spilled out, weapons locked on the car. But before they could move, the back door opened—and two more operatives leapt out, assault rifles at the ready. A firefight exploded under the glow of street lamps.

A bullet ricocheted off a car fender inches from Sullivan’s shoulder. He surged forward, using the door as cover, while Hadas swept in behind him, cornering the driver. Within seconds it was over: the terrorists lay disarmed and groaning on the asphalt. Hassan al-Amiri was nowhere in sight, but they recovered a map of Jerusalem and a phone loaded with detonator codes.

“We’ve got what we need,” Hadas said, voice low. “He’s planning a second wave tonight at the Jaffa Gate.”

Sullivan checked his watch. Midnight was less than an hour away. They called Levi: “We hit them now.”

———

In a safe house on the outskirts of the Old City, Sullivan and Hadas regrouped while the commandos prepared to move in. Exhaustion finally caught up to them. Hadas peeled off her gear in the modest bathroom and stepped into a hot shower. Cole cleaned his rifle by the window, gazing out at Jerusalem’s sleepy sprawl illuminated by golden streetlights.

The water ran, and a minute later Hadas emerged, wrapped in a towel. Steam curled around her; the overhead bulb cast her in soft light. Sullivan looked up.

She met his eyes—and then dropped the towel without hesitation. Cole didn’t dare look away. The air between them shifted, the charge of adrenaline softening into something more intimate. He set his rifle aside, crossed to her, and gently pulled her into his arms.

Their first kiss was slow, searching. Hadas’s fingers threaded through Sullivan’s hair, drawing him closer. He eased the towel away. In the hush of the safe house, they came together with a hunger born of danger and mutual respect, each touch igniting them. Nothing graphic was spoken; instead, soft gasps and whispered names punctuated the night as they made love on the narrow cot.

Afterward, they lay entwined—Hadas draped across Sullivan’s broad chest, her head cushioned by his shoulder. He brushed damp hair from her face. She traced his scars with a single finger.

“You’re good at this,” she teased sleepily.

Sullivan smiled. “Not bad myself.”

She closed her eyes. “Thank you for watching my back tonight.”

He kissed her forehead. “Always.”

For a long moment they simply held each other, the distant rumble of jeeps and radio chatter reminding them of the mission still to come.

———

At 11:45 PM they slipped back into action. Under cover of darkness, the commandos fanned out around Jaffa Gate. Sullivan and Hadas moved up a side alley. A lone guard almost discovered them, but Hadas neutralized him with a swift choke hold. They pressed on, finding the cell’s bomb-maker crouched over a row of explosives hidden beneath an archway.

Hassan al-Amiri emerged from the shadows, pistol in hand. He sneered. “You’re too late, foreigners.”

Sullivan raised his rifle, but Hadas spoke first, her voice icy. “It’s over, Hassan.”

He jerked the trigger. The shot flew wide. In an instant, commandos swarmed in. Bullets cracked, and Hassan fell under a hail of suppressive fire. Two of his men tried to run; an Israeli operative took them down with non-lethal rounds.

Within five minutes, the site was secured, bombs defused. Sullivan radioed Levi: “Package secure. Threat neutralized.”

The sun had yet to rise over the Old City when Cole and Hadas finally let themselves exhale. They’d prevented a massacre. They’d fought side by side and bled together—and in each other, found something neither had expected.

As the first call to prayer echoed across the stones of Jerusalem, Sullivan glanced at Hadas. She smiled, running a hand along the locket she’d tucked in her shirt pocket—the one he’d given her before the raid, an American flag and Israeli Star of David entwined.

“Coffee?” he offered.

She sat up, stretching. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

They walked out of the gate together, mission accomplished—and something more quietly born between them. In a city that had seen millennia of conflict, Cole Sullivan and Hadas Nativ had forged an alliance that would endure far beyond this night of fire and shadows.",1,1767159112.0,AmericanZionists,0,1.0,False

We currently own:

Pixel Phone
2 iPhones 
echo show 11
3 ring alarm key pads 
1 ring doorbell
Dozen ring contact sensors
Maybe some other ring alarm stuff.
Shield TV pro 
Decent 3 year old Windows PC with 1TB HD, not used for much. 

Few first gen Alexa speakers and first gen show. 

TVs are mixed but I like googles tv UI the best so my future TVs will be Android based. 

None of this besides the ring system is really set up to do anything. 

Using this as my base to build around I think I'm trying to decide between googles or Amazon's ecosystem. I'm planning to add:

A couple hubs
Thermostats 4(leaning ecobee)
Smoke alarms
1 wired floodlight camera
6 or so other outdoor cameras (will likely be battery)
Smart motorized blinds
Lights 
Smart plugs
Smart lock (yale)
A few more smart speakers/displays. 
Idk what else. My appliances are smart but never touched them. 

More about me:
I love my pixel phone. I use my Google account to synch with as much as I can. Gemini atm is my favorite AI. I can barely operate the iPhones. 

I Hate the Alexa App, Prime UI, and Fire TV. 
The echo show looks and sounds great though and my daughter prefers that to listen to music. 
If the Alexa Hubs replace having to use the app with better UI this might be less an issue. 

Ring alarm is nice, works and I'm already set up...Local storage would be preferable and nice but not over convenience. 

I'm not really on a budget. 

My priority list. 
1. Security system, cameras convenience for all us to use as few apps as possible. Central hubs that will control and organize view cameras. (Local storage is cool if it's easy, but I'm probably going to be paying for ring security anyway) Convenience. I'll be the main user with the pixel phone but the iPhone users play around some. 

2. Quality of products I'd rather have premium stuff but only if it's all going to work together. 

3. Entertainment/quality of life

From what I’m understanding, it’s specifically junk food like soda, candy, and energy drinks, but it also depends on the state that you live in. I’m just confused why energy drinks (FL) would be restricted, but having coffee is fine? I can understand how energy drinks are more sugary, but I feel like both options can be just as bad for you in terms of sugar and caffeine content. Second of all, I feel like this has been going on for a while in the community in which a lot of people think that people abuse EBT by just using it for junk food and I feel like now that they’re putting this in place it takes away from a lot of children who don’t get to typically experience the joys of having a sweet treat regularly, let alone AT ALL. Another thing that I thought of, which correct me if I’m wrong, but I feel like not having this stuff covered by EBT would be almost an incentive for people to go out of their way to get it even more…? Like how you restrict a certain food when your child is younger, that then, therefore leads to them only craving that type of food even more in the future. I definitely do understand that sugar can be an issue, but I feel like a lot of the EBT grocery hauls or lists I see mainly consist of junk food when it comes to stuff for their children’s lunches or maybe it’s in bulk to last longer but idk. Do you guys think this is a legitimate restriction that I’ll do more good than harm or the other way around? ",0,1767159052.0,foodstamps,23,0.41,False

1q04tr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1q04tr0/normie_in_aa/,Normie in AA?,"I’m not sure if I should even attend AA anymore. A year and a half ago, I quit because I wanted to be healthier and be a better version of myself for my faith. One day, I met with a friend whom I thought was really cute and he talked about how well AA has benefited his life, and I told him how I quit drinking, but neglected to mention I didn’t quit because I had a problem, but rather I quit on my own accord. He asks me if I wanted to try AA (he assumed I was sober because I had an issue) and I was too much of a wuss to tell him I didn’t need it. And then I was too much of a wuss to tell my sponsor I didn’t want to do the program, and it’s been 18 months. That same sponsor that made me think “for an alcoholic, she has her shit together, same do a lot these people, this AA thing must’ve helped them.” Like, come on! I knew there was always a disconnect between me and these people. I’m a people-pleaser and friends outside of AA told me I gaslit myself into thinking I have alcoholism and wasted my time. Although AA did bring me a close friend and it showed me God, so those are a plus. 

Prior to 18 months ago, I always controlled my drinking, and each drinking session I made sure I didn’t have over 2-3 drinks because I hated the feeling of drunkness, and would throw up due to nausea, so I’d cut myself off then. I was *cognizant* I had to drive home and face my mom or the police if I was drunk, and I work the following day. Because I have an “off button,” controlled myself, and hated intoxication and its physical and mental effects, and could go days to weeks without drinking, am I an alcoholic? PS- I was two weeks free of alcohol before talking to this guy that brought me into AA, and I had little to no restlessness, irritability, or discontent. I was *ok* without booze. I entered the program two weeks “sober.” 


Here is my story within AA- it felt weird introducing myself as “Name-Alcoholic” all the time because I didn’t believe it. I rarely related to anyone’s shares, and when I shared, it was just a general take on whatever topic was being used in that meeting. One guy was roasting me for my birthday and he said “you’re just here because you’re lonely and need a form of self help, not because you’re a true alcoholic;” that stung because he was 100% true, but I just laughed it off and said “haha, I wish,” even though it wasn’t a wish of mine- it was my reality. I just went to my first meeting and rolled with it, because I liked what I was learning, liked fellowships, and just followed sponsor direction. 

The only thing that remotely concerns me is when I’m studying/ chilling w friends I enjoy a drink to the point where I feel weird if I’m not drinking a bit, and when I do get that drink I feel relaxed/ alert and able to study better or hang out at parties better; but again, the key is I controlled it and was cognizant of my intake. But I loved it, I’d look forward to every next session. But I wasn’t feigning for the next Saturday per se, I’d just tell myself “I REALLLLYYY am craving it, but I can skip the wine with dinner tonight, it’s only Monday and I don’t like weekday drinking.” And I would adhere to that plan. And I wouldn’t watch the calendar like a hawk or anything, per se. I did not drink everyday by any stretch, and my “routine” where I felt like I had to have X when I did Y, was not very common. When I was tired or irritated, I’d usually have a drink on stand by, but I’d limit myself. 

Anyway, I had my first alcoholic drink since 18 months ago two days ago with Dad at a fine restaurant bar. It was a tequila sunrise, I felt normal, like as if nothing has changed. Dad and I split a High Noon, and we ended the night with a shot of Jameson each. Earlier in this subreddit post, I’d say how I controlled myself and was cognizant of how I had to drive and attend a work meeting the next day, so I definitely couldn’t get drunk, and I surely could not get nauseated. I’m aware of all these factors. I did enjoy the loose euphoric feeling. Besides, who doesn’t? But I drank two large cups of water towards the end of dinner to water it down so I could drive Dad home. Just like old times, lol. The old water jug. Let me also say that I like being in control, I hate being loopy. I even hated taking too much of weed, and I always thought “gosh, how do I get this garbage outta my system?! I’m freaking out!” Then yesterday, I had dinner again with Dad (he has a lot of loyalty points at nice restaurants), and since I’m on work break, I figured why not some red wine? I didn’t even finish the entire cup. It was gross, and I avoided alcohol the rest of the night. And today, I have not consumed any. And I feel generally fine. However, I don’t know if it’s because I’m PMSsing, anxious, or an over-thinker (as I am all, lol) but am I gaslighting myself into thinking I have the phenomenon of craving, or is this just me being me because I have just reintroduced alcohol back into my life with no intention of abusing it, just like I didn’t in my drinking days? Like I said, I’m not feigning for the weekend, nor do I have a set plan on how I’m drinking Saturday, if I even end up drinking. But I might just be gaslighting myself into a craving, but seeing that I don’t really give that big of a shit if I didn’t drink today or tomorrow, I think I’m doing well, just like old times. I was told to stop over thinking it, work on my daily activities, and watch my drinking to see how my behaviors change. I was advised to go another week or two without alcohol and see how I felt. Because it’s not *how much* you drink, but how it makes you feel, and how you hold up in between drinks. Looking back, before I got “sober,” I was excited to go to social events and have 2-3 max, but again, I controlled it. I rarely had alcohol in my home, and there were a few times I just needed a beer to go with my studying, as the coffee shops were closed, or a shot of vodka in my morning Dutch Bros lemonade, but those weren’t so frequent despite me really craving those, and again, I still controlled that day’s intake, and I’d consider the lemonade in my daily limits. My close friend in AA (the only person that knows this), told me it’s likely my drinking patterns will be the exact same as a year and a half ago, as “no true alcoholic truly regains control” (Big Book). He told me judging by everything I wrote here, I do not fit the description of the typical alcoholic, even with this weird feeling I have in between sessions, that is likely just anxiety about the new change, as I do not cave into it. And I have not talked to my sponsor in two weeks, ever since I realized I was attending something I did not need. I don’t know how I’m going to tell her any of this. And this other girl in the program called me two weeks ago telling me she was sentenced to AA from drug court and she just rolled with it as well for three years, stating she doesn’t think she’s a real alcoholic too. She also told me there are a lot of people sentenced to AA who are not real alcoholics. 


Am I just an anxious/ problem drinker (or the typical social girl in her twenties) as opposed to the true alcoholic? 

“If anyone who is showing inability to control his drinking can do the right-about-face and drink like a gentleman, our hats are off to him.”
(As if I had an inability 18 months ago, but I thought this quote was profound.”)

1q04s6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1q04s6h/done_with_airbnb_a_rant_advice_request/,Done with Airbnb?  A Rant + Advice Request,"I've been on Airbnb for 13 years, have personally stayed in 100+ listings as a guest, including living in Airbnbs full-time for \~2 years, and attained and maintained Superhost status for the entirety of the time I hosted on Airbnb.  I have well over 100+ excellent reviews, with every single one raving about how clean we are, what good guests we are, how we go above and beyond cleaning before we leave, even going as far as saying they would have never even known we had checked in or stayed if we hadn't stripped the beds for them.  While the frequency and relative enjoyment of staying in Airbnbs has decreased for us quite a bit in recent years, I didn't think I would ever actually contemplate never booking an Airbnb again, but I think I may finally be there after this latest experience.

  
My husband and I just checked out of a casita after a 4 day stay earlier today.  We had actually stayed in this same casita before, just under 4 years ago, and even had some close friends of ours stay in the same unit just a few months ago, and we all really liked it, so we were looking forward to returning.  The property has beautiful views and we were looking forward to some lowkey time to relax after a very busy holiday season.  The casita is a separate dwelling with a supposedly private backyard/courtyard next door to the main house that is owner/host occupied.

  
We started receiving messages from our host shortly before check-in indicating that their previous guest had raided their linen closet and they were scrambling to get the bedding ready, but to not worry about it.  We arrived shortly after the published check-in time and both the host and his wife were in the unit and were visibly quite frazzled and at the time were trying to fix a lazy susan in one of the cabinets that had apparently fallen apart right as they were getting the unit ready.  We told them it was no problem and just waited outside in the courtyard while they finished getting ready.

  
We settled in and when we went to take showers that evening, we realized that the shower could only be either scalding or freezing.  Literally.  It was so hot that steam was pouring out and burning our skin or if you moved the dial the tiniest bit it was like sitting in an ice bath.  It was pretty miserable, but we just stood outside of the spray and used washcloths and thought we'd try again the next day.

  
We were away from the property the majority of the next 2 days, but on the 3rd day (last full day), we noticed that the temp of the shower had finally moderated, but there was suddenly almost no pressure.  We also noticed the toilet wasn't refilling fully after flushing.  Neither seemed like a major deal, and since we were checking out the next day, we thought worst case scenario, we could just shower when we got home.  Since that was literally our only day in a 2+ week stretch to relax, we didn't want to have to deal with home repairs in our small space when we were just trying to enjoy some down time.

  
On top of that, at that point, I felt really uncomfortable with the host.  I didn't interact with him that much on our first stay, but since he was in the unit when we arrived, we had talked a bit, and he was telling me how a movie had recently been filmed on his property.  He made comments about how he liked watching the actresses in their bikinis and honestly I found the way he said it pretty gross.

  
Over the following days, I got more creeped out.  I'm into photography and I come to the area specifically to photograph sunrises and sunsets.  Every time I would go into our courtyard, I would see the host in or around his own courtyard or side yard looking at me and in some cases, literally being startled when my camera would pick up his face in the frame.  Every time my husband and I would go to use our hot tub, there he would come outside again, making noise on various projects.  It got to the point our dog couldn't even be in the yard with us because he was always on the other side of the (short) fence making noise and that would start her barking and we would feel like we needed to take her in.

The last night, we had gotten out of the hot tub and after a (non-pressurized) shower, I had just thrown on my robe and gone back out to take sunset photos and sure enough there he was again and I literally felt like a prisoner trying to hide beyond where he could see me, even though I couldn't see the sunset from there.  It was just so uncomfortable.  Literally every single time my husband and I would go outside, he would come out too, but not actually interact.  It was just weird.  So that was annoying, but we kind of just thought whatever and that with all the issues (the internet was also much too slow for streaming and there was trash/junk piled up outside both dwellings in addition to the plumbing and privacy issues; he also let his cat out and it climbed on the fence of our courtyard even though we had told him how reactive our dog was to cats) we just wouldn't ever consider returning.  We had even discussed leaving the issues out of our review and just providing private feedback to the host about fixing the shower since we felt bad that we were return guests that had such a negative second experience.

Then as we were on our way home shortly after check-out, the host messaged and said the sink was ""stoped up with a tribble smelling liquuid"" (stopped up with a terrible smelling liquid?) and that the ""lounge chair with spill or perhaps dog pee"" and that he'll ""have to determine the cost of the damage and let you and AB&B pf the damge"" (not fully sure what that means).  He sent pictures of maybe a quarter of an inch of water in the kitchen sink and a large stain covering the living room recliner.

We had noticed the huge stain on the recliner at check-in and it really did look like someone had peed on the chair - someone MUCH larger than our dog as it completely covered the entire seat of the large recliner.  The host had literally been standing next to the chair as we were waiting to check-in, so it never even occurred to us to mention it as it was so obvious. 

When I told my husband about the sink, he said it had started to back up that morning as he was washing the dishes, but he thought nothing of it, especially in light of all the other plumbing problems.  We literally never even cooked a meal while there so the extent of us using the sink was washing coffee mugs and our milk frother each morning - definitely nothing that would have clogged a sink.  My husband even said he noticed a huge jug of extra strength Draino under the sink, indicating this had been a known problem.

I immediately wrote back and said that actually I thought he had widespread plumbing issues and described what we had experienced.  I also mentioned the condition we found the chair in and that our dog absolutely would not have peed in the house on furniture and that we were honestly shocked by his accusations.  Without going into how creeped out he made me feel, I did enumerate how the experience had been a disappointed for us and that honestly we had contemplated requesting a partial refund and would not be paying for damage we didn't cause.  I also referenced our stellar review history, including from him.

He seemed to back down at that point merely saying that he would have fixed things if he had known.  I basically said what I said here that we didn't feel it was fair that we spend our one day of downtime on our trip watching home repairs for issues beyond our control.  Several hours later he messaged again and was really kind of nasty.  Now instead of other guests stealing from him just before our stay, supposedly it was he and his wife staying in the casita right before our stay so they would have known about any pre-existing issues because of that.  He also stated that his whole casita flooded and that his new guests arrived to wet floors... I don't know how a quarter inch of water in the sink led to the entire casita flooding unless his attempted repairs caused that and so how in the world he thinks that is on us is beyond me.

Anyways, while he didn't explicitly say it, I took his messages as he would not be pursuing action against us, but that we were welcome to try to pursue a partial refund through Airbnb if we wished.  My first inclination is that I don't have the time or desire to mess around with it, but there are a couple of caveats.  The more I've thought about it, the more upset I am about how uncomfortable I was made to feel within what should have been our private space.  I don't think any couple trying to relax in the backyard in the hot tub and in front of the fire wants to feel like someone is watching them.

When I was talking to my husband about how the hosts bikini comments and watching us made me feel, he told me that he hadn't wanted to tell me, but that when he was out there in the hot tub alone, he noticed that the host had an exterior camera on a swivel that wasn't pointed at the hot tub at that time, but that certainly could have been moved to view that area.  I feel that is totally inappropriate and just not okay.

I'm just not sure what action to take, if any.  I don't think I'll really get anywhere with Airbnb support, but it is important to me to leave a factual review.  I want to make sure it doesn't get removed, and it's difficult because he really does have so many positive reviews.

I really don't know what to think because his accusations feel so completely false and like he's trying to stick us with a bill for things we were absolutely not responsible for.  I always try to see both sides of things, but I just don't know why he would assume we're to blame for his widespread plumbing problems.  We also live in the desert Southwest, also on a rural property with acreage, and also have a well, plus are just reasonable/respectful people, so it's not like we'd put anything other than water in the drains and toilet paper in the toilet.

This is actually not the first time a host has tried to stick us with the bill for replacing things we didn't damage - another host in 2019 tried to claim we had destroyed a couch when we arrived to it absolutely falling apart and it was already the very cheapest model you could buy at the time from Ikea.  Luckily, we had the foresight to take pictures when we checked-in so that didn't go anywhere.

I know from lurking around this sub that there is a recommendation to take videos on arrival, and I suppose I will have to do that from now on.  I'm really not sure that I'll ever book another Airbnb, but I already have a reservation for this weekend for a big girls trip, so at least for that, I'll make sure to be in more of a CYA mode.  It's just so sad to me that this is the place we've come to.  I had such good Airbnb experiences for so many years and now I'm just at a loss.

I'd love any recommendations or insights on how to handle this situation and/or how to avoid situations like this in the future.  My husband and I are very well-traveled - 49 U.S. states and 38 countries with hundreds, if not thousands, of Airbnb, hotel, and resort stays - so we're not new to this, but it seems like it's just impossible to ever have a good Airbnb stay anymore.

At forty-eight he still cut an imposing figure—tall, broad-shouldered, with neatly peppered hair and ice-blue eyes that missed nothing. Three weeks ago he'd been assigned to desk duty; now, after intercepting chatter about a sleeper cell primed for a devastating attack in Israel, he was back on the front line.

Director Reynolds gave him the rundown: an Islamist network, deeply embedded, had secured explosives and planned near-simultaneous strikes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Israelis’ domestic security service, Shin Bet, was stretched thin. The CIA was offering support: surveillance drones, signal intercepts, a small contingent of American operatives under Sullivan’s command. By nightfall, Cole was boarding a red-eye to Tel Aviv.

———

Touching down at Ben Gurion Airport before dawn, Sullivan was met by Shachar Levi, chief of Shin Bet. A lean man in his early fifties, Levi exuded quiet confidence. Behind him stood an elite commando team—eight operators in discreet black fatigues, rifles slung at rest.

“Agent Sullivan,” Levi said, extending a hand. “Welcome to Israel.”

Moments later, Levi ushered Sullivan into a secure briefing room. Maps, satellite photographs, and intercepted cell-phone recordings plastered the walls. “The cell is about to move on Jerusalem,” Levi explained. “We know only one of their key lieutenants: Hassan al-Amiri. He’s believed to be coordinating from Lod. We need to find him before he triggers the detonators.”

Sullivan studied the charts. “What about a local partner?”

Levi nodded. “I’ve arranged someone. Hadas Nativ, a top field agent. You two will run point.”

Before Cole could respond, the door opened, and in walked Hadas Nativ. She was striking: raven-black hair pulled into a tight braid, dark eyes that flicked over him with both curiosity and wariness. At twenty-eight, she was a decade younger but every inch the professional—lean, strong, and visibly restless.

“Agent Sullivan,” she said, offering a firm nod. Her accent was crisp, American-tinged after years abroad. “I look forward to working with you.”

Cole inclined his head. “Likewise.”

As they reviewed the intel, tension crackled. Hadas argued for a cautious, intelligence-led infiltration; Sullivan pressed for rapid action—he’d learned in the Marines to seize the initiative. Neither would back down. By the time their commando backup arrived, the air between them was as charged as the explosives they hunted.

———

Under cover of night, Sullivan, Hadas, and the Israeli team moved into Lod. The apartment building where Hassan al-Amiri was thought to hide stood three blocks from the bustling downtown market. Sullivan’s CIA techs had hacked the intercom; they slipped inside, rifles at low ready.

The operation unraveled almost immediately. A guard spotted a reflection of torchlight. Gunfire erupted in the narrow corridor. Sullivan dove behind a pillar, return-firing as Hadas flanked left, dispatching a second guard with a clean headshot. The commandos stormed in: two upstairs to secure the suspected safe room, the rest pinning down remaining hostiles.

Sullivan cleared the corner into a small living room. A panic-stricken family huddled on a couch. At the far end, a door stood ajar. Beyond it, he could hear the unmistakable click of a locked safe. He kicked it open; inside lay a handful of cellphone-triggered detonators, wires arranged like a spider’s web.

Hadas tapped in codes on her iPad, cross-checking coordinates. “He’s not here,” she murmured. “He got away.”

Sullivan’s gut clenched. “We need another lead—fast.”

They swept the apartment and recovered CCTV footage. An underground parking garage showed Hassan slipping into a black sedan. The tracker on his phone blinked in the city center. Hadas relayed the info. There was a lull in the street noise—too quiet.

Suddenly, masked gunmen poured into the building. They pressed in from both ends of the hallway. Sullivan and Hadas dove back to back, trading suppressive fire. Over the burst-fire, Hadas managed to slide beside him, her presence steadying. Together, they fought through, forcing the attackers back and clearing an exit.

They piled into the commandos’ SUVs and roared off into the night, racing to the city center. Once there, they spotted the black sedan, engine idling by a Lidl supermarket. Sullivan and Hadas spilled out, weapons locked on the car. But before they could move, the back door opened—and two more operatives leapt out, assault rifles at the ready. A firefight exploded under the glow of street lamps.

A bullet ricocheted off a car fender inches from Sullivan’s shoulder. He surged forward, using the door as cover, while Hadas swept in behind him, cornering the driver. Within seconds it was over: the terrorists lay disarmed and groaning on the asphalt. Hassan al-Amiri was nowhere in sight, but they recovered a map of Jerusalem and a phone loaded with detonator codes.

“We’ve got what we need,” Hadas said, voice low. “He’s planning a second wave tonight at the Jaffa Gate.”

Sullivan checked his watch. Midnight was less than an hour away. They called Levi: “We hit them now.”

———

In a safe house on the outskirts of the Old City, Sullivan and Hadas regrouped while the commandos prepared to move in. Exhaustion finally caught up to them. Hadas peeled off her gear in the modest bathroom and stepped into a hot shower. Cole cleaned his rifle by the window, gazing out at Jerusalem’s sleepy sprawl illuminated by golden streetlights.

The water ran, and a minute later Hadas emerged, wrapped in a towel. Steam curled around her; the overhead bulb cast her in soft light. Sullivan looked up.

She met his eyes—and then dropped the towel without hesitation. Cole didn’t dare look away. The air between them shifted, the charge of adrenaline softening into something more intimate. He set his rifle aside, crossed to her, and gently pulled her into his arms.

Their first kiss was slow, searching. Hadas’s fingers threaded through Sullivan’s hair, drawing him closer. He eased the towel away. In the hush of the safe house, they came together with a hunger born of danger and mutual respect, each touch igniting them. Nothing graphic was spoken; instead, soft gasps and whispered names punctuated the night as they made love on the narrow cot.

Afterward, they lay entwined—Hadas draped across Sullivan’s broad chest, her head cushioned by his shoulder. He brushed damp hair from her face. She traced his scars with a single finger.

“You’re good at this,” she teased sleepily.

Sullivan smiled. “Not bad myself.”

She closed her eyes. “Thank you for watching my back tonight.”

He kissed her forehead. “Always.”

For a long moment they simply held each other, the distant rumble of jeeps and radio chatter reminding them of the mission still to come.

———

At 11:45 PM they slipped back into action. Under cover of darkness, the commandos fanned out around Jaffa Gate. Sullivan and Hadas moved up a side alley. A lone guard almost discovered them, but Hadas neutralized him with a swift choke hold. They pressed on, finding the cell’s bomb-maker crouched over a row of explosives hidden beneath an archway.

Hassan al-Amiri emerged from the shadows, pistol in hand. He sneered. “You’re too late, foreigners.”

Sullivan raised his rifle, but Hadas spoke first, her voice icy. “It’s over, Hassan.”

He jerked the trigger. The shot flew wide. In an instant, commandos swarmed in. Bullets cracked, and Hassan fell under a hail of suppressive fire. Two of his men tried to run; an Israeli operative took them down with non-lethal rounds.

Within five minutes, the site was secured, bombs defused. Sullivan radioed Levi: “Package secure. Threat neutralized.”

The sun had yet to rise over the Old City when Cole and Hadas finally let themselves exhale. They’d prevented a massacre. They’d fought side by side and bled together—and in each other, found something neither had expected.

As the first call to prayer echoed across the stones of Jerusalem, Sullivan glanced at Hadas. She smiled, running a hand along the locket she’d tucked in her shirt pocket—the one he’d given her before the raid, an American flag and Israeli Star of David entwined.

“Coffee?” he offered.

She sat up, stretching. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

They walked out of the gate together, mission accomplished—and something more quietly born between them. In a city that had seen millennia of conflict, Cole Sullivan and Hadas Nativ had forged an alliance that would endure far beyond this night of fire and shadows.",1,1767158289.0,MachineGuns,0,1.0,False

# Chapter X

“… *Many were those who underestimated them. Who dismissed their species as young, their technology as primitive and simple, their strength negligible.*

*It is true that their technology was nowhere near as advanced as the Council’s. But it is the way they use it, that truly sets them apart, for no other civilization in the galaxy fights the way they do.*

*They have a name for that. It is the Storm War, the Steel Blizzard. Relentless. Methodical. Unyielding.*

*They do not have raycasters, antimatter or dark energy weapons. And yet, there are few things more terrifying than the roaring of Terran artillery, for once it starts, it never ends. And you never forget the horrors it can unleash…”*

*- From the memoirs of Valyra Thay Rynn*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The falling raindrops sizzled on the red-hot steel barrels of the enormous artillery pieces, creating an eerie shroud of mist that blanketed the hellish battlefield, disturbed only by the muzzle flashes of the siege guns and the distant rippling of explosions. The hills and terraces surrounding the wide, rugged canyon might have once been crop fields for the strange, scarlet flora the Dra’var’th brought with them to every world they terraformed. Once, they would have been tended to by armies of slaves, watched over by cruel supervisors always ready to execute anyone who fell behind the quota, was too old, too frail, or otherwise drew their masters’ ire.

Once, their blood and flesh would have fertilized those very crops they tended. All that remained now, were a few scattered pieces of the irrigation systems, jagged piping and bits of machinery jutting from the ground here and there. The rest of the landscape had become a lunar hellscape, potted with craters large and small, craters filled with the burning, broken wrecks of vehicles and the viscera of the soldiers that had died here. What was left, was crisscrossed by zigzagging trenches, forward operating bases and artillery emplacements, spiderwebbing out from the armored and shielded mobile fortress the Terrans had brought down from orbit, engineering vehicles even now churning the broken earth to expand that layered network of fortifications over a thousand kilometers wide, but swiftly tightening like a noose around the invaders’ target, the ominous obsidian castle built into a massive peak rising up from one of the canyon’s edges, overlooking the chasm and the city below.

Scenes like these were unfolding all across the condemned world. So large was the invasion, that the networks of trenches and the fires, could be seen from space, rendered across viewscreens throughout the entire fleet. The diminutive, rodent-like Myiori truly had the chance to shine here, a chance they seized with eagerness, showcasing their expertise at engineering, working around the clock to expand the Pact fortifications at a breakneck speed, great machines churning out new earthworks with frightening efficiency. The Marauders of the lupine Shartan and the Orkyn Hunters formed the core of the invading army’s shock troops, their armored vehicles launching brutal sallies to break through enemy positions, Terran cosmonauts poring in their wake, while Nyxian and Chett special forces stalked the battlefields, finding every weakness and exploiting it with maximum efficiency. The warlord watched it all unfold on the holographic display in the forward command center, issuing orders to make adjustments as needed.

Above, Pact strike craft of every shape and size flitted about, delivering their deadly payloads with mechanical precision upon their designated targets, while railgun slugs pounded any anti-air defenses that dared reveal themselves, all the way from orbit. The rain, a rare-enough event on the arid planet, even here, in what passed as the world’s temperate zone, had turned the ochre-tinted soil into a crimson swampland. *At least it masked the blood*, Kainan thought as his eyes took in the carnage unfolding before his eyes.

The seismic aftershock of an explosion rippled through the command bunker, sending half-empty coffee mugs clattering to the floor and causing dust to stream down from the featureless ceiling, a massive, prefabricated slab of armored ferrocrete made in a Terran factory light-years away and assembled here by one of those immense, mechanical beasts perfected over centuries of subterranean warfare by the Myiori. Nearby, someone was barking orders into the comms, attempting to find reinforcements for a regiment that had been ambushed by enemy armor, while simultaneously diverting a flight of medical transports towards their coordinates. Kainan wiped his smeared brow with the back of his glove, suppressing yet another grimmace as the casualty reports from that not-so-distant detonation, started streaming in. Seven thousand, three hundred and sixty-four confirmed killed, another thirteen thousand, one hundred and fifteen missing in action. All because a Dra’var’th plasma cannon struck a munitions depot, the shockwave inflicting fatal damage to its reactor, ultimately causing a catastrophic meltdown that reduced the entire ship to its component atoms. Another twenty thousand, four hundred and seventy-nine ghosts to haunt his nightmares.

“My lord!” called out a lieutenant who had just ran into the bunker, nearly tripping over another officer’s boots as she dodged around a colonel that was frantically waving his arms at a commander on his vidcom. She was a young woman, whose dark skin and features identified her sub-Saharan African heritage, though her accent held nothing reminiscent of the languages once spoken on that now-dead continent. Like pretty much everyone in the Terran Empire, she was descended from the colonies, removed from the homeworld by several generations, as few were those who made it off of Earth when it fell. She was clutching a datapad against her chest, eager and energetic despite still panting from the exertion. “We just received the latest batch of decrypted intel from the relay station. We have the layout of the entire canyon, sir.”

Kainan turned, eyebrows curling into a frown. How had they managed that? It wasn’t like the Dra’var’th to have left a map of their planetary command center right there for the Pact to find. Such intel should have been among the first things to be deleted from the relay’s databanks, the moment it became clear the system would fall to the invasion. Noticing the warlord’s expression, the woman tapped something on her datapad and pulled up a series of schematics, a wild grin lighting up her features as the information began to render on the main holographic projector. “We couldn’t salvage the actual maps, but the eggheads in the intelligence division had the bright idea of looking into their low-level infrastructure. That is, the Dra’var’th infrastructure. Sir,” the woman stammered with barely-contained excitement. Kainan signaled her to go on.

“Sanitation schematics, civilian power grids, slave processing logistics, food distribution…” she explained, activating layer after layer on the holographic projection of the canyon, adding increasingly-detailed information to the map with each tap on her datapad. “The point is, no one thinks of these things as important, right? Not in the middle of a full-scale invasion, anyway. That was the idea, so our people looked into it and sure enough, there it was, all this juicy information still stored neatly in their databanks,” the officer continued. “So, our eggheads got to work combining all this intel into something usable and voila,” she said, gesturing towards the holographic projection. “We have a map of the entire planet. Every tunnel, every road, every pipe and aqueduct, including the ones servicing their military sites. The point is, we can-”

“That’s more than enough, lieutenant,” Kainan cut her off with a lifting of his hand, otherwise she might have gone on forever, forgetting to even breathe. “I get the picture. Good work, you may return to your post,” he said as his eyes turned away from the battlefield, to scan the improvised map now flickering above the war table. The lieutenant froze for a moment, before remembering herself and snapping a hasty salute before turning to leave the command center. “Oh and don’t forget your datapad,” the warlord said without looking in her direction. “Oh. Sir. Sorry, sir…” the young woman muttered in response, darting back to fetch her forgotten instrument before exiting the room.

Such a breach in discipline was rare among the Terrans, who valued efficiency above all, especially in military matters. But the excitement spreading like a wildfire throughout the command center was justified in this case, as this truly was a monumental achievement on the part of the intelligence division, providing the Pact with clear, detailed information of where everything important was on the wretched little planet. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” asked a lumbering, green-skinned giant in that familiar voice which reminded Kainan of a rock slide. Second Chieftain Orguroth Ur-Kagga, one of the Orkyn military leaders and an old friend of the warlord since the early days of the Pact, his eyes focusing on a particular section of the holographic map.

Kainan grunted an affirmation, then tapped something on his wristcomp, zooming the projection in on the lines snaking their way beneath the soil of the plateau, all the way to the obsidian fortress that served as the planetary governor’s residence. “You should get the Myiori,” the Orkyn war leader rumbled. “If we’re going to be crawling through a *gorking* sewer, we’ll need their Siege Miners. Better leave the Shartan behind, though, their bulk would be a hindrance down there.” Sound counsel, Kainan thought, especially since Shartan skin, as tough and leathery as it was, had a particular vulnerability to acidity and their lungs were prone to irritation. And though Pact helmets were equipped with rebreathers, it was best to conserve their filters for situations where they truly needed them.

“We should bring a squad or two of Ko’bol as well, I think,” responded the warlord, pulling up the troop manifest to locate what he needed. *There*. The seven hundred and fifty-ninth Battle Warren, stationed only a hundred kilometers away from the command bunker’s position. Their species was short and rodent-like, akin to the Myiori, but lankier and hairless, with large, round ears and a long face that reminded him of an extinct animal from Earth-that-was, known as a mole rat. “Along with all the available Psi Corps units-”

“And myself,” interjected *another* voice that Kainan knew, this one womanly, with a lilting accent he had come to cherish. Sure enough, there she was, standing in the door frame with her helmet clutched under her arm, her white armor stained with grease and the black blood of the Dra’var’th, her midnight-black hair cascading down to her midsection, iridescent eyes the color of a summer sky reflecting the flickering light of the command center, looking more like a wild fay war spirit from ancient legend than the heiress of a galactic kingdom. Not that the warlord hadn’t sensed her approaching from the moment her dropship landed. She *should* have been safely back aboard the flagship, resting after the ordeal she had just endured. Somehow, she still held herself with that impossible, ethereal grace as she crossed the threshold, despite her evident exhaustion. He read the report and knew exactly how much effort it had taken her to suppress that amplified aura of terror by herself. He could see the shadows now lingering in her eyes after what she had to do to defeat that Nosferatu.

There would be no convincing her to rest, though. Kainan had come to know her well enough by now to know when it was pointless to argue. And seeing that look in her eyes, he understood why she needed to be here, to see this battle through to the bitter end, whatever that might be. After all, he knew those shadows all too well.

The tunnel reeked of dust and stagnant water and things too vile to name. It was pitch-black, for the light fixtures above, ancient things suspended from the corroded husks of cables, had not been functional since before mankind discovered fire. To call it old, would be an understatement, the decrepit passage dating back to the earliest days of the planet’s colonization, its crumbling walls made not from the glassy black hyperdiamond the Dra’var’th of the present era used, that psionically-reactive material that looked so much like obsidian, but of a drab geopolymer not unlike the ferrocrete the Terrans used in their constructions. Roughly oval-shaped, it had once been a sanitation tunnel, elevated catwalks on either side once providing pathways for maintenance crews to travel along, though those had long since been worn away by age, leaving only a few diminished stumps of metal where the supporting struts once were, while of the catwalks themselves, nothing remained.

The floor beneath, if one could call it that, squelched repulsively under each step, the silt and whatever else, having degraded into a hydrocarbon goo that stuck to every surface like tar and made traversal an unpleasant chore. The night vision function in the advancing party’s helmets made navigation possible in the pitch-black darkness, though with their rebreathers turned off, there was nothing they could do about the awful, acrid stench. It wasn’t concentrated enough to be poisonous, at least, as crumbling sections in the wall where the passage intersected natural cave systems and what looked to be improvised ventilation systems, provided enough air circulation to make the vile atmosphere survivable, but that was the only positive thing that could be said about it. Nobody complained, though, not even the Alvari princess, who once again surprised everyone with how stoic she could be when the situation called for it. Everyone except Kainan, that is, who knew what it was like to be underestimated and wielded that like a weapon, much like she did.

Those thoughts did not linger long upon his mind, though, for his keen eye was drawn to those improvised ventilation ducts that ran along the ceiling, far too new and shabby to have been constructed by the tunnel’s ancient builders. No, these were something someone else had rigged, out of scrap metal and whatever else. That they were functional, meant the tunnel was still being used by someone and sure enough, he soon spotted a section of piping which bore the tell-tale signs of recent repair. It meant the task force might have been alone down there, a worrying thought, as that could mean ambushes and traps. And while both he and Valyra extended the reach of their psionic senses as far as it was possible, things such as automated turrets, war bots and tripwires would not register within the Veil, only beings with a soul would.

At his side, the armored felines ears twitched, then flattened against her skull, their kevlar sheaths sliding flush against the great beast’s helmet. Her tail, likewise clad in kevlar and segmented plates, coiled slowly left, then swished rapidly in the opposite direction, the whip-crack thundering down the tunnel’s length like a gunshot. Terran rifles and Orkyn thumpers immediately snapped up, trained upon the crumbling section of wall up ahead, where the ancient tunnel intersected a dormant magma tunnel, creating a cavernous chamber filled with stalactites, the perfect cover for something nasty to hide behind. Even with all the sophisticated sensors in his suit of armor and his own genetically-engineered sharpness, Kainan knew that the whisper cat’s senses were sharper still, especially her hearing. And so did everyone else who was present, apparently, for no one hesitated, or questioned Kat’s warning.

“So… *You’re* the *mighty* warlord of the… What’cha callin’ it? The Terran Empire?” called a voice from somewhere up ahead, though the acoustics made it impossible to pinpoint its origin. Kainan felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck, for the voice was devoid of the tell-tale distortion and reverberations of an electronic speaker, which meant…

He could sense Valyra’s apprehension as well, her fingers tightening their grip around the hilt of her shardblade. This *shouldn’t* have been possible, no living being should be able to conceal its echo in the Veil so completely, that even the supremely-skilled and gifted Alvari princess would be unable to sense its presence. Yet that was exactly what had happened.

“Oh, quit standing around all gobsmacked like a bunch of dramatic wankers,” the voice continued, dripping with irritation. “If we wanted to off you lot, we’d have blown up the tunnel when you rounded that bend about five miles back the way you came.” A flashlight momentarily blinded the optics in the warlord’s helmet as the figure stepped out from behind a pile of mud-caked rubble. A *human* figure, but short, no more than five feet tall, broad and stocky. *Drov*. Slaves that had been genetically engineered by the Dra’var’th for hard manual labor in the mines. This one wore mismatched war gear, mismatched plates of scrap metal bolted to a harness and a makeshift firearm in his hands. His face was bearded and scarred, a strip of cloth covering the ruin where an eye had once been, the jagged scar continuing up to the man’s receding hairline of matted brown streaked with silver. He looked unimpressed. “Thought you’d be taller,” he commented as more figures, similarly outfitted and diminutive, emerged from their hiding places among the stalagmites. Kainan found the comment rather ironic, considering the Drov were like children compared to the towering Kalidani, bred for servitude rather than war. Judging by their outfits, though, it was evident that the submission genes had failed to take root.

“I take it you must be the local rebels,” replied the warlord, gesturing at his companions to lower their weapons. The Drov grunted his affirmation. “Aye, that we are. And we’re probably here for the same bloody reason you are. The fucking command center,” he commented as he lowered his makeshift rifle and extended his hand. “Lawrence Carter, boss of this cell,” he introduced himself. “Though everyone just calls me Laws.”

The warlord gripped his hand and shook it firmly, having to bend down slightly due to the height difference. “Kainan Wolfe. Warlord of the Empire, though you already knew that,” he responded. The Drov scoffed at that. “Bloody stupid name, if you ask me. Makes you sound like a pretentious prick, but at least you’re the type of bloke who personally leads his men in battle, rather than commanding them from behind a desk.”

“Careful, Laws,” another rebel called out, a mean-looking woman with curly hair the color of rusted iron. “The bird in the white armor’s an elfie.” Eyes snapped to Valyra and everyone froze, gloves creaking as grips tightened around weapons. Someone muttered something about *bloody aliens* and *kin-traitors*. The princess sighed and pulled her helmet off, shaking her braided locks loose. Ignoring the murderous stares of the other rebels, she stepped towards their leader with the confidence and poise of one who owned the ground she walked upon. “I am here because we have a common enemy,” she said, her tone calm and steady, her posture regal even here, in the ancient, crumbling sewer, her expression unreadable.

The red-haired woman shot her a venomous glare before stepping in front of the rebel leader, demanding his attention. “Laws, we don’t need these Council-loving bastards. Where were these imperials and their alien pals during the eighty years of torture we endured? I vote we off them and move on,” she hissed.

Carter cut her off with a back-handed slap across her face. “Shut your trap, Moira!” he barked at her. The two squared off against each other, hands drifting towards the shivs thrust through their belts. Kainan watched their posturing in silence, his expression a featureless mask beneath his helmet. During his years of slavery among the Dra’var’th, he had not interacted much with the Drov, as their kind did not work in the gladiator barracks where he’d lived. From what he knew of them, they were an uncouth, brutish people, their culture disconnected from the homeworld of the human species and developed almost entirely under the yoke of the Dragon House into something more savage and vicious in a petty way that Terran cultures, which held honor and discipline in high regard, found disdainful.

Even so, they were *still* human, despite their flaws. They were still his responsibility. “That’s enough,” the warlord commanded, peeling off his own helmet and clipping it to his belt, the withering scowl on his features bringing the confrontation to an end as he imposed his authority with the weight of his voice alone. The Drov leader did not seem impressed. “Moira’s right about two things, lad,” the Drov leader addressed him. “What have these bloody aliens done to earn the right to be here? Second, why should we trust you?”

Kainan sighed, reflexively reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose before freezing when he remembered the glove had touched tunnel walls coated in that vile sludge. Eighty years of isolation and fear had made them mistrustful of anything that wasn’t them. “They fought and bled at our side,” he answered, his tone stern and final, making it clear to the rebels that he would tolerate no more divisiveness. “As for your other concern, the imperial constitution guarantees each planet autonomy, aside from certain obligations and civil rights everyone has to uphold. Work with us and you’ll have no masters to obey.”

That seemed to appease the rebels at least somewhat, though Carter still made a show of taking his time to consider his response, even though he’d appeared eager to cooperate only a short while ago. “Fine,” he finally relented. “But you’d better keep your word, lad, because the Drov won’t exchange one master for another.”

With that, the warlord stepped forward and signaled the rest of the task force to continue their advance. His features betrayed nothing, but deep down, he was troubled by the Drov rebels’ ability to mask their psionic presence and how they might have achieved this. And sensing the cold dread in Valyra’s thoughts, he couldn’t help but conclude it wasn’t anything good, for the Alvari princess knew far more about the Veil than himself and her state of apprehension did not bode well. If that wasn’t enough, even Kat kept her distance from these rebels, her posture stiff and alert, as if she were pacing around a nest of ice hornets in deep hibernation. He couldn’t ask Valyra about it, though, not until the dust settled and they could afford a few minutes alone.

“One more thing, lad,” said Carter, breaking the tense silence as they advanced. “The planetary governor’s ours to deal with. That’s not up for debate,” he demanded and Kainan had to suppress the urge to groan, starting to second-guess the decision to collaborate with the rebels. “As long as you don’t kill him before he gives us the codes to shut down the defense grid,” the warlord responded, his tone ice-cold and steely. He understood the wrath of these Drov, their burning need for revenge, but the mission had to take priority. He wasn’t willing to sacrifice more of his troops because some volatile insurgent couldn’t keep his finger off the trigger until after the Psi Corps conducted an interrogation. Violence should never be more than a reluctantly-used tool and these rebels seemed far too liberal in their willingness to wield it. And far too short-sighted to consider either the price, or the consequences.

“Fuck you, you bastard!” the red-haired woman shouted, her hand already on her makeshift pistol as she turned to face him. “You come here with your elfie and aliens, making demands and dictating rules like you own the air we breathe! The hell do you know about what we’ve suffered?”

The entire task force ground to a halt, Valyra tensing as the warlord’s fingers twitched closer to his own sidearm. The whisper cat let out a low, menacing growl. “Moira…” the rebel leader grumbled a warning, wearily eyeing the great feline that looked like she was about to pounce upon someone. Unfortunately, Moira ignored him, too consumed by her own fury and pride to realize she was on the verge of starting a civil war before they even finished conquering the planet. “Fuck you too, Laws! You’ve gone soft, thinking we have some kind of kinship with these tossers, just ‘cause our forebears came from the same homeworld!” Her eyes drifted to the other rebels. “Well, this ain’t Earth and we ain’t humans no more! We’re *Drov*! This is *our* war, not theirs! They’re just here to conquer and subjugate, just like any other off-worlders!” Some of the rebels grunted approvals. *Too* many. “We do this our way!” Moira continued, sensing her moment and seizing upon it. “If they ain’t Drov, they die!”

The gunshot reverberated across the tunnel like a thunderclap. It hadn’t been Kainan who fired it, nor any of his soldiers, or the Orkyn and Ko’bol troops with them. The barrel of Carter’s makeshift shotgun still smoked and Moira was clutching her chest, hate-filled eyes glazing over. She tried to speak, to spew out a few last venomous words, but as her lips parted, blood was all that came out. She staggered forward, then collapsed face-first into the sludge at her feet. Kainan gritted his teeth, his hand still hovering near his sidearm as he glared menacingly at the Drov rebels. Between their volatility and whatever it was that made Valyra and the whisper cat apprehensive, he was wondering whether or not these insurgents were more of a liability than a boon to the Terran cause. “Are we done killing each other?” he growled, his voice low and cold, yet it loud enough for the entire war party to hear him. Carter glanced at him briefly before continuing down the tunnel. “Aye. We’re done.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kainan eyed the rebels wearily as they finished setting up their improvised explosive devices to breach the bulkhead that separated the decommissioned sanitation tunnel from the maintenance section of the governor’s palace. He could see the tell-tale signs of the Dra’var’th’s influence upon their demeanor. The short tempers, the blind hatred of anything that wasn’t them, the hints of vicious, casual cruelty in their gazes… A few more generation and they would be no better than the Gorgons, pitiful wretches consumed by bloodlust, so unlike the species they were descended from, which had learned to temper its worst tendencies through that discipline that was so cherished by every human culture that still endured in the twenty-seventh century.

There was no doubt in his mind that they would be a source of trouble in the decades and centuries to come, the imperials would have their work cut out for them if they wished to rehabilitate their wayward siblings. His Orkyn allies, too, faced a similar dilemma with the Go’bleen, their species having also suffered under the brutal yoke of the Dragon House even longer than humanity had. He felt *so* tired, so numbed by the galaxy’s senseless cruelty, yet that was precisely why he *had* to go on, to ensure some semblance of hope and peace for the future generations, even if he had to drench himself in blood to do so.

Because theirs was not that brighter galaxy where a better way existed to enact much-needed change. It was a galaxy torn apart by its own hubris, fear and complacency, rotten to the core by a widespread acceptance of a broken status quo, ruled by beings whose every waking moment was spent in the pursuit of easy things, of *safe* things, things that felt comfortable and familiar, even though what made them necessary long ago, had long since ceased existing. It was a galaxy which needed *correction*. And that required drastic and painful measures to be taken, terrible sacrifices that had to be made. And it was up to him to make them. After all, *someone* had to. And no one else would.

He felt a hand reach for him, slender fingers intertwining with his calloused, taloned ones. As was increasingly often the case, Valyra was there to right when he needed her the most, even if he could never bring himself to ask for comfort or reveal to anyone the weight he carried, for he had to be the symbol, the immovable pillar that his people looked up to. *I am so sorry for dragging you into my web of conspiracies and bloodshed*, he wished to say. She deserved better, deserved so much more than what he could offer her, yet there she was, standing by his side, standing with *him*, even when that caused her turmoil and pain she could have avoided if she only kept herself closed off and distant, like her station required her to.

“Together?” she said, her voice soft and low enough that only he could hear it. “Together,” he echoed her, giving her hand a small and gentle squeeze, an unspoken, silent promise to face the coming storm with her and see it through to the end.

The explosion shattered the poignant silence, stirring dust that had laid still for centuries into a curtain that both concealed and ended that brief moment they shared. Weapons ready, they stormed through, once more into the breach. Panicked slaves ran and screamed and cowered, their supervisors frozen in the momentary panic, a brief second of indecision that would prove decisive. To the right, an Orkyn thumper fired, Second Chieftain Ur-Kagga nailing one of the slavemasters to the wall. Ko’bol and Myiori troops fanned out, flashbangs and automatic rifles laying down suppressing fire that sent Dra’var’th guards scrambling for cover. Then, the Psi Corps entered the fray, sending bullets flying in every direction, corkscrewing around obstacles, zigzagging behind cover, finding the gaps in enemy defenses and reaping a bloody harvest from their numbers.

The rebels fought like maddened berserkers, throwing themselves at the enemy with reckless abandon, making up for their poor equipment with sheer savagery alone. And in the shadows and the corners, behind piping and machinery where the dim glow of the light fixtures never reached, the whisper cat stalked, a silent, deadly predator emerging unseen, striking like the wind and disappearing before her targets even registered the lethal wounds that had been inflicted upon them. She was not fighting, she was *hunting*. And the Dra’var’th guards were her prey.

“Death Knights ahead!” someone yelled into the comms. Kainan stepped forward to engage, only to feel Valyra’s hand closing around his wrist and yanking him back. Up ahead, one of the rebels ran at the advancing squad, plasma bolts setting him on fire. He roared and pushed through the pain, enraged by the horrid, lethal wounds rather than deterred. And then it happened. There was a… something Kainan could only describe as an *implosion*, but in the Veil. He staggered back, a sharp spike of pain driving into his skull and making his vision darken at the edges, blood trickling from his nose. Up ahead, the rebel and the Death Knights lay motionless on the ground, their lifeless bodies radiating an emptiness that just felt *wrong* in a way that made the warlord’s stomach lurch.

At his side, Valyra fought her own vertigo, naked horror written plainly on her features. “Stars…” she muttered. “They’re *Hollows*… They’ve burned out their own souls to make themselves into…” She did not have to finish, for Kainan could piece together what she meant. Rather than a presence in the Veil, they were an *absence*, a hole waiting to be filled with life ripped from other beings, ending themselves and every living thing around them the moment they unleashed that horrid power. *That* was why they were invisible to psionic senses, they had turned themselves into null entities anathema to existence itself. Kainan gritted his teeth, for this was an abomination.

“Don’t give me that look, lad!” Carter angrily snapped at him. “We have to be prepared to do whatever it takes to kill the bloodsuckers! Its the only way to win against their powers and technology,” the Drov leader barked out. And the warlord had no counter to that, for he knew all too well what sacrifice truly meant and how far it had to sometimes go. He understood now why they were so fatalistic and so volatile, for to make themselves into what they had become, these rebels had to sacrifice their very souls, along with everything that made them living beings. In their pursuit of freedom for their people, they had willingly subjected themselves to a fate far worse than death, worse than anything imaginable. “Victory at any cost…” the warlord muttered, his shoulders set in grim resignation. He gave the signal to advance.

“Wait!” the princess called out. She stepped forward, kneeling down to examine the remains of the Dra’var’th warriors, her brows furrowing. “These aren’t regular Death Knights,” she said softly, pointing to the pattern of crimson thorns embroidered upon their cloaks, forming a specific sigil that Kainan didn’t recognize. “They’re royal guards,” Valyra explained as she rose. Kainan frowned. Royal guards? But that meant…

“Second Chieftain…” he called, his friend stepping forward. “Take the task force and secure the command center. Make sure the rebels don’t kill the planetary governor before we extract the information we need from him,” the warlord instructed. He glanced at Valyra, knowing she’d stay with him regardless of any attempts to dissuade her and besides, he wouldn’t deny her the right to decide her own path, no matter how much he loathed the idea of her following him into danger. And so, he said nothing. She gave him a small nod.

The Orkyn war leader glanced at the two of them and let out a sigh. “Very well. But do not get yourselves killed, this war is over without the two of you.” With that, he barked out orders and left the pair and the whisper cat to their new mission.

I feel like most characters these days are designed specifically to be played in a single squad with a dedicated support or a very narrow concept. Flins + Ineffa, Nefer + Lauma, Mauvika + Night Spirit, Skirk + Freeze, and so on. Additionally, many enemies and bosses are clearly designed around new characters. For example, the Wild Hunt having 2× HP if you don’t have any Nod-Krai characters.

Obviously, this approach is more profitable for the developers, but I’m curious, purely theoretically, whether it’s possible to return the meta to a more relaxed state, before heavy power creep and overt shilling. Without changing existing characters or enemies, how could the game’s meta be shifted?

Here are some obvious ideas off the top of my head:

• Release 4-star supports for dead or underdeveloped party concepts, but make them less restrictive than Chevreuse. For example: a Bloom support for Kaveh and Nilou; a BoL support for Arlecchino and Clorinde; or a support that increases damage based on low HP for Furina and Hu Tao.

• Add more organization-based buffs (Knights of Favonius, Adepti, etc.). Sadly, Varka is most likely going to be a Hexenzirkel character instead of bringing KoF buffs.

• Release more generalist 5\* supports, like Durin. I can see Nicole being an ATK buffer, but overall we need more “Durins” and fewer “Coffees.”

• Freeze the current DPS ceiling and avoid releasing 130k+ DPS characters for at least a year.

• Reduce Abyss blessings, or even remove them entirely, since they’re far too strong right now.

• Add a 13th Abyss floor with the current Floor 12 difficulty, while making Floor 12 easier to smooth the DPS-check transition.

• Share the timer between each SO room and start runs with full energy.

• Change Imaginarium Theater to allow 4 elements instead of 3 and add more AoE-focused rooms.

I love spending time in bookstores, especially when it comes to fiction. I love movies, and some of my all-time favorites include 'The Holiday,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Sound of Music.'

I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule.

1q04igr,https://i.redd.it/1k3sezjg1hag1.jpeg,The new Gemini integration in Google Maps is really good. Here's are the pro tips for much better navigation with Gemini,"**TL;DR:** Gemini in Maps isn't just a chatbot; it’s a semantic search engine. Stop searching for coffee and start searching for quiet places with outlets and oat milk. Use it to summarize reviews instantly, find parking before you arrive, and navigate using landmarks (turn at the Starbucks) instead of distances.

Most people are suffering from AI fatigue right now, and I get it. But the integration of Gemini into Google Maps is one of the few instances where AI actually solves a friction point we face daily: the gap between *what we want* and *how we have to search for it*.

Here is how to use the new system to actually save time and reduce driving stress.

The Shift: Keywords vs. Semantic Search

The biggest mistake people make is treating the new Maps like the old Maps.

* **Old Way:** Search Italian restaurant, filter by 4 stars, scroll through photos to see if it looks nice, read 10 reviews to see if it's loud.
* **New Way:** Ask Gemini, Find me a romantic Italian dinner spot nearby that isn't too loud and has easy parking.

Gemini understands the *context* of the reviews and the vibe of the place, not just the metadata.

Top 3 High-Value Use Cases

**1. The Vibe Check (Review Summarization)** Instead of doom-scrolling through hundreds of mixed reviews to find out if a place is good for a date or a work meeting, ask specific questions about the consensus.

* *Prompt:* Does this place have a good atmosphere for a quiet business meeting?
* *Result:* Gemini scans the text of thousands of reviews to give you a definitive Yes, reviewers mention it is quiet during the day or No, it is known for loud music.

**2. The Complex Co-Pilot (Route Planning)** This is helpful when you are already driving and cannot fiddle with filters. You can chain commands that would usually require 4-5 taps.

* *Prompt:* Find a gas station along my route that also has a decent coffee shop and won't add more than 10 minutes to my trip.
* *Result:* It performs the spatial calculation and the quality filtering simultaneously.

**3. Landmark Navigation (The Human Directions)** GPS saying Turn right in 500 feet is useless if you are bad at estimating distance. Gemini utilizes visual data to give cues based on what you can actually see.

* *Benefit:* You will hear directions like Turn right after the AutoZone or Turn left at the traffic light. It reduces the cognitive load of driving in unfamiliar cities.

Pro Tips for Power Users

**The Parking Hack** Before you head to a crowded downtown area or a new venue, ask Gemini specifically about the parking situation.

* *Ask:* What is the parking situation like at \[Venue Name\]?
* *Why:* It will pull specific details from reviews like The lot is small, but there is a garage around the corner that is usually empty. This saves you from circling the block for 20 minutes.

**The Entrance Trick** Useful for large malls, hospitals, or airports.

* *Ask:* Where is the best entrance for \[Specific Department/Store\]?
* *Why:* It can often guide you to a specific door rather than the generic street address, saving you a 15-minute walk.

**Natural Language Findy** Use the camera/Live View feature for on-the-spot discovery. If you are standing on a street corner, you can point your camera and ask, Which of these cafes has the best vegan options? It overlays the data on the real world.

Best Practices

* **Be Specific:** The more details you give, the better. Don't just say dinner. Say dinner under $30 with outdoor seating.
* **Verify for Critical Info:** AI can hallucinate. If you need to know if a place is strictly nut-free due to a severe allergy, always call the venue. Use Gemini for preference, not medical necessity.
* **Use Voice:** The integration shines when used hands-free. Get comfortable talking to your phone in the car. It feels weird at first, but it is safer than typing.

How to Access It

You might already have it without realizing. There is no specific On switch in the settings; it is a server-side update. Here is how to check if you are live:

* **Update Your App:** Ensure you are on the latest version of Google Maps on Android or iOS.
* **In Navigation:** Start a drive. Look at the microphone icon. If it has the Gemini sparkle (star) icon instead of the standard plain microphone, you are active. Just tap it or say Hey Google to start chatting.
* **In Search:** Type a full sentence into the main search bar instead of a keyword. If it gives you a summarized answer rather than a list of links, that is Gemini working.
* **Visual Search:** Tap the camera icon in the search bar (Lens) to use the AR features.

1q04icu,https://v.redd.it/bly68kzi2hag1,Short Story: Shadows of the Holy Land,"Cole Sullivan strode into the cavernous debriefing room at CIA headquarters in Langley, his Marine Corps posture unbending even in civilian clothes. At forty-eight he still cut an imposing figure—tall, broad-shouldered, with neatly peppered hair and ice-blue eyes that missed nothing. Three weeks ago he'd been assigned to desk duty; now, after intercepting chatter about a sleeper cell primed for a devastating attack in Israel, he was back on the front line.

Director Reynolds gave him the rundown: an Islamist network, deeply embedded, had secured explosives and planned near-simultaneous strikes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Israelis’ domestic security service, Shin Bet, was stretched thin. The CIA was offering support: surveillance drones, signal intercepts, a small contingent of American operatives under Sullivan’s command. By nightfall, Cole was boarding a red-eye to Tel Aviv.

———

Touching down at Ben Gurion Airport before dawn, Sullivan was met by Shachar Levi, chief of Shin Bet. A lean man in his early fifties, Levi exuded quiet confidence. Behind him stood an elite commando team—eight operators in discreet black fatigues, rifles slung at rest.

“Agent Sullivan,” Levi said, extending a hand. “Welcome to Israel.”

Moments later, Levi ushered Sullivan into a secure briefing room. Maps, satellite photographs, and intercepted cell-phone recordings plastered the walls. “The cell is about to move on Jerusalem,” Levi explained. “We know only one of their key lieutenants: Hassan al-Amiri. He’s believed to be coordinating from Lod. We need to find him before he triggers the detonators.”

Sullivan studied the charts. “What about a local partner?”

Levi nodded. “I’ve arranged someone. Hadas Nativ, a top field agent. You two will run point.”

Before Cole could respond, the door opened, and in walked Hadas Nativ. She was striking: raven-black hair pulled into a tight braid, dark eyes that flicked over him with both curiosity and wariness. At twenty-eight, she was a decade younger but every inch the professional—lean, strong, and visibly restless.

“Agent Sullivan,” she said, offering a firm nod. Her accent was crisp, American-tinged after years abroad. “I look forward to working with you.”

Cole inclined his head. “Likewise.”

As they reviewed the intel, tension crackled. Hadas argued for a cautious, intelligence-led infiltration; Sullivan pressed for rapid action—he’d learned in the Marines to seize the initiative. Neither would back down. By the time their commando backup arrived, the air between them was as charged as the explosives they hunted.

———

Under cover of night, Sullivan, Hadas, and the Israeli team moved into Lod. The apartment building where Hassan al-Amiri was thought to hide stood three blocks from the bustling downtown market. Sullivan’s CIA techs had hacked the intercom; they slipped inside, rifles at low ready.

The operation unraveled almost immediately. A guard spotted a reflection of torchlight. Gunfire erupted in the narrow corridor. Sullivan dove behind a pillar, return-firing as Hadas flanked left, dispatching a second guard with a clean headshot. The commandos stormed in: two upstairs to secure the suspected safe room, the rest pinning down remaining hostiles.

Sullivan cleared the corner into a small living room. A panic-stricken family huddled on a couch. At the far end, a door stood ajar. Beyond it, he could hear the unmistakable click of a locked safe. He kicked it open; inside lay a handful of cellphone-triggered detonators, wires arranged like a spider’s web.

Hadas tapped in codes on her iPad, cross-checking coordinates. “He’s not here,” she murmured. “He got away.”

Sullivan’s gut clenched. “We need another lead—fast.”

They swept the apartment and recovered CCTV footage. An underground parking garage showed Hassan slipping into a black sedan. The tracker on his phone blinked in the city center. Hadas relayed the info. There was a lull in the street noise—too quiet.

Suddenly, masked gunmen poured into the building. They pressed in from both ends of the hallway. Sullivan and Hadas dove back to back, trading suppressive fire. Over the burst-fire, Hadas managed to slide beside him, her presence steadying. Together, they fought through, forcing the attackers back and clearing an exit.

They piled into the commandos’ SUVs and roared off into the night, racing to the city center. Once there, they spotted the black sedan, engine idling by a Lidl supermarket. Sullivan and Hadas spilled out, weapons locked on the car. But before they could move, the back door opened—and two more operatives leapt out, assault rifles at the ready. A firefight exploded under the glow of street lamps.

A bullet ricocheted off a car fender inches from Sullivan’s shoulder. He surged forward, using the door as cover, while Hadas swept in behind him, cornering the driver. Within seconds it was over: the terrorists lay disarmed and groaning on the asphalt. Hassan al-Amiri was nowhere in sight, but they recovered a map of Jerusalem and a phone loaded with detonator codes.

“We’ve got what we need,” Hadas said, voice low. “He’s planning a second wave tonight at the Jaffa Gate.”

Sullivan checked his watch. Midnight was less than an hour away. They called Levi: “We hit them now.”

———

In a safe house on the outskirts of the Old City, Sullivan and Hadas regrouped while the commandos prepared to move in. Exhaustion finally caught up to them. Hadas peeled off her gear in the modest bathroom and stepped into a hot shower. Cole cleaned his rifle by the window, gazing out at Jerusalem’s sleepy sprawl illuminated by golden streetlights.

The water ran, and a minute later Hadas emerged, wrapped in a towel. Steam curled around her; the overhead bulb cast her in soft light. Sullivan looked up.

She met his eyes—and then dropped the towel without hesitation. Cole didn’t dare look away. The air between them shifted, the charge of adrenaline softening into something more intimate. He set his rifle aside, crossed to her, and gently pulled her into his arms.

Their first kiss was slow, searching. Hadas’s fingers threaded through Sullivan’s hair, drawing him closer. He eased the towel away. In the hush of the safe house, they came together with a hunger born of danger and mutual respect, each touch igniting them. Nothing graphic was spoken; instead, soft gasps and whispered names punctuated the night as they made love on the narrow cot.

Afterward, they lay entwined—Hadas draped across Sullivan’s broad chest, her head cushioned by his shoulder. He brushed damp hair from her face. She traced his scars with a single finger.

“You’re good at this,” she teased sleepily.

Sullivan smiled. “Not bad myself.”

She closed her eyes. “Thank you for watching my back tonight.”

He kissed her forehead. “Always.”

For a long moment they simply held each other, the distant rumble of jeeps and radio chatter reminding them of the mission still to come.

———

At 11:45 PM they slipped back into action. Under cover of darkness, the commandos fanned out around Jaffa Gate. Sullivan and Hadas moved up a side alley. A lone guard almost discovered them, but Hadas neutralized him with a swift choke hold. They pressed on, finding the cell’s bomb-maker crouched over a row of explosives hidden beneath an archway.

Hassan al-Amiri emerged from the shadows, pistol in hand. He sneered. “You’re too late, foreigners.”

Sullivan raised his rifle, but Hadas spoke first, her voice icy. “It’s over, Hassan.”

He jerked the trigger. The shot flew wide. In an instant, commandos swarmed in. Bullets cracked, and Hassan fell under a hail of suppressive fire. Two of his men tried to run; an Israeli operative took them down with non-lethal rounds.

Within five minutes, the site was secured, bombs defused. Sullivan radioed Levi: “Package secure. Threat neutralized.”

The sun had yet to rise over the Old City when Cole and Hadas finally let themselves exhale. They’d prevented a massacre. They’d fought side by side and bled together—and in each other, found something neither had expected.

As the first call to prayer echoed across the stones of Jerusalem, Sullivan glanced at Hadas. She smiled, running a hand along the locket she’d tucked in her shirt pocket—the one he’d given her before the raid, an American flag and Israeli Star of David entwined.

“Coffee?” he offered.

She sat up, stretching. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

They walked out of the gate together, mission accomplished—and something more quietly born between them.

# LoRA Pilot (The Last Docker Image You'll Ever Need)

Pod template at RunPod: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&ref=o3idfm0n

> Your AI playground in a box - because who has time to configure 17 different tools?
Ever wanted to train LoRAs but ended up in dependency hell? We've been there. LoRA Pilot is a **magical container** that bundles everything you need for AI image generation and training into one neat package. No more crying over broken dependencies at 3 AM.

##  What's in the box?
- **🎨 ComfyUI** (+ ComfyUI-Manager preinstalled) - Your node-based playground
- **🏋️ Kohya SS** - Where LoRAs are born (web UI included!)
- **📓 JupyterLab** - For when you need to get nerdy
- **💻 code-server** - VS Code in your browser (because local setups are overrated)
- **🔮 InvokeAI** - Living in its own virtual environment (the diva of the bunch)
- **🚂 Diffusion Pipe** - Training + TensorBoard, all cozy together

Everything is orchestrated by **supervisord** and writes to **/workspace** so you can actually keep your work. Imagine that! 

Few of the thoughtful details that really bothered me when I was using other SD (Stable Diffusion) docker images:

- No need to take care of upgrading anything. As long as you boot :latest you will always get the latest versions of the tool stack
- If you want stabiity, just choose :stable and you'll always have 100% working image. Why change anything if it works? (I promise not to break things in :latest though)
- when you login to Jupyter or VS code server, change the theme, add some plugins or setup a workspace - unlike with other containers, your settings and extensions will persist between reboots
- no need to change venvs once you login - everything is already set up in the container
- did you always had to install mc, nano or unzip after every reboot? No more!
- there are loads of custom made scripts to make your workflow smoother and more efficient if you are a CLI guy; 
- Need SDXL1.0 base model? ""models pull sdxl-base"", that's it! 
- Want to run another kohya training without spending 30 minutes editing toml file?Just run ""trainpilot"", choose a dataset from the select box, desired lora quality and a proven-to-always-work toml will be generated for you based on the size of your dataset.
- need to manage your services? Never been easier: ""pilot status"", ""pilot start"", ""pilot stop"" - all managed by supervisord
---

## Default ports

| Service | Port |
|---|---:|
| ComfyUI | `5555` |
| Kohya SS | `6666` |
| Diffusion Pipe (TensorBoard) | `4444` |
| code-server | `8443` |
| JupyterLab | `8888` |
| InvokeAI (optional) | `9090` |

Expose them in RunPod (or just use my RunPod template - https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&ref=o3idfm0n).

---

## Storage layout

The container treats **`/workspace`** as the only place that matters.

Expected directories (created on boot if possible):

- `/workspace/models` (shared by everything; Invoke now points here too)
- `/workspace/datasets` (with `/workspace/datasets/images` and `/workspace/datasets/ZIPs`)
- `/workspace/outputs` (with `/workspace/outputs/comfy` and `/workspace/outputs/invoke`)
- `/workspace/apps`
  - Comfy: user + custom nodes under `/workspace/apps/comfy`
  - Diffusion Pipe under `/workspace/apps/diffusion-pipe`
  - Invoke under `/workspace/apps/invoke`
  - Kohya under `/workspace/apps/kohya`
  - TagPilot under `/workspace/apps/TagPilot` (https://github.com/vavo/TagPilot)
  - TrainPilot under `/workspace/apps/TrainPilot`(not yet on GitHub)
- `/workspace/config`
- `/workspace/cache`
- `/workspace/logs`

### RunPod volume guidance

The `/workspace` directory is the only volume that needs to be persisted. All your models, datasets, outputs, and configurations will be stored here. Whether you choose to use a network volume or local storage, this is the only directory that needs to be backed up.

**Disk sizing (practical, not theoretical):**
- Root/container disk: **20–30 GB** recommended 
- `/workspace` volume: **100 GB minimum**, more if you plan to store multiple base models/checkpoints.

---

## Credentials

Bootstrapping writes secrets to:

- `/workspace/config/secrets.env`

Typical entries:
- `JUPYTER_TOKEN=...`
- `CODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=...`

---


## Ports (optional overrides)
COMFY_PORT=5555
KOHYA_PORT=6666
DIFFPIPE_PORT=4444
CODE_SERVER_PORT=8443
JUPYTER_PORT=8888
INVOKE_PORT=9090
TAGPILOT_PORT=3333

## Hugging Face (optional but often necessary)
HF_TOKEN=...                 # for gated models
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1  # faster downloads (requires hf_transfer, included)
HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1    # faster Xet storage downloads (included)

## Diffusion Pipe (optional)
DIFFPIPE_CONFIG=/workspace/config/diffusion-pipe.toml
DIFFPIPE_LOGDIR=/workspace/diffusion-pipe/logs
DIFFPIPE_NUM_GPUS=1
If DIFFPIPE_CONFIG is unset, the service just runs TensorBoard on DIFFPIPE_PORT.


## Model downloader (built-in)

The image includes a system-wide command:
• models (alias: pilot-models)
• gui-models (GUI-only variant, whiptail)

Usage:
• models list
• models pull <name> [--dir SUBDIR]
• models pull-all

## Manifest

Models are defined in the manifest shipped in the image:
	•	/opt/pilot/models.manifest

A default copy is also shipped here (useful as a reference/template):
	•	/opt/pilot/config/models.manifest.default

If your get-models.sh supports workspace overrides, the intended override location is:
	•	/workspace/config/models.manifest

(If you don’t have override logic yet, copy the default into /workspace/config/ and point the script there. Humans love paper cuts.)

## Example usage

# download SDXL base checkpoint into /workspace/models/checkpoints
models pull sdxl-base

# list all available model nicknames
models list

## Security note (because reality exists)

- supervisord can run with an unauthenticated unix socket by default.
- This image is meant for trusted environments like your own RunPod pod.
- Don’t expose internal control surfaces to the public internet unless you enjoy chaos monkeys.

## Support

This is not only my hobby project, but also a docker image I actively use for my own work. I love automation. Effectivity. Cost savings. 
I create 2-3 new builds a day to keep things fresh and working. I'm also happy to implement any reasonable feature requests.
If you need help or have questions, feel free to reach out or open an issue on GitHub.

1q04dw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q04dw7/even_men_who_say_they_want_marriage_and_family/,Even men who say they want marriage and family still expect women to carry everything,"Something I rarely see discussed honestly:  
men who *say* they want marriage, family, and something serious are often no different from the low-effort ones.

They use “I want something serious” as a label, not as behavior.

I’ve met men who talked about marriage and family from the first dates — yet they couldn’t plan a single proper date. Every plan was on me. Every suggestion, every decision, every structure. They followed passively, contributed nothing, and then slowly pulled back even more.

What’s worse: some of them explicitly agreed that the man should put in more financial effort at the beginning — they said yes to that standard. And yet by the second week, they became passive, started avoiding paying, suggesting splitting everything, minimizing effort. Not because they were struggling — they had jobs, money, stability. They just didn’t want to invest.

Others rushed into “serious relationship” talk after two coffees and then immediately showed controlling, unhealthy behavior. Talking about moving closer, seeing each other every day — and then casually saying things like I shouldn’t see my friends as much, or that I should make them my top priority right away. No trust built, no foundation — just entitlement wrapped in “commitment.”

This is what exhausts me:  
selfishness disguised as seriousness.

Whether it’s casual dating or “marriage-minded” men, the pattern is the same:

* minimal effort
* maximum access
* emotional, physical, and mental labor pushed onto the woman
* and constant pressure for the woman to lower her standards

Marriage, sex, long-term relationship — it doesn’t matter. The goal is still the same: extract as much as possible while giving as little as possible.

And society backs this up.  
When men complain, they’re validated.  
When women say they’re tired of this, they’re told they’re picky, demanding, unrealistic.

Why is it acceptable for men to want companionship, care, intimacy, and support — but unacceptable for women to want consistency, effort, generosity, and respect?

I’m not asking for luxury.  
I’m asking for intentionality.

Planning dates. Following through. Keeping your word. Not becoming passive once interest is secured. Not trying to renegotiate basic effort once a woman is emotionally involved.

If a man can’t show effort early, he won’t magically become generous, stable, or respectful later — no matter how much he talks about marriage or family.

I’m genuinely tired of being told to “give chances” to men who already show, very clearly, that they want the benefits of a relationship without the responsibility of one.

I don't even have any plans for New Year's. I've seriously just been in my apartment alone for over a week during the holidays and maybe went to a coffee shop and walked around town once. I mean, what else is there to do in the winter?

I feel like we're constantly told we need to be extraordinary to matter, but honestly? There is so much peace in just having a regular, boring, stable life. I stopped trying to be the main character and started enjoying just being here.

Last Sunday started like any other. Doors opened. Hymns warmed up. Coffee brewed strong enough to raise the dead. Then… the flood arrived.
Not the biblical kind. No ark required. Just a very determined pipe that decided today was the day.
As water crept down the aisle, parishioners looked around wondering if this was part of the sermon illustration. The choir paused mid-song. Someone whispered, “Is this a sign?” Another replied, “If it is, it’s definitely saying call restoration.”
Miracles Were Requested… and Mops Were Delivered
Prayer circles formed quickly:
“Lord, please stop the water.”
“Lord, please protect the carpet.”
“Lord, please don’t let this reach the sound system.”
The pastor calmly announced,
“Let us pray… and also shut off the main water valve.”
The Flood That Brought Everyone Together
Volunteers grabbed towels like they were passing communion wafers. Deacons became human sandbags. The youth group discovered that squeegees are, in fact, holy instruments.
Someone joked,
“Well, at least the baptismal font is feeling included.”
A Lesson Was Learned
Faith can move mountains—but when water damage strikes, it helps to move fast. Because while prayer is powerful, standing water waits for no one.
So if your church ever experiences a flood, remember:
Pray first 🙏
Laugh a little 😄
Then call professionals who can dry things out before mold starts its own ministry

Here are my recent pickups:

**Baltic MR01 Roulette (Salmon dial, stitched blue strap)**

I got this at their New York showroom. It wasn’t a brand I was really interested in but during our visit, I realized they had a studio in Soho so I took a look and was impressed with the designs. I’m on the fence on the build quality though. 

**Brew Metric Retro Dial**

Also got it during our New York trip. As Brew is a Brooklyn based watch brand, it was only fitting to get it during our time there. They’re primarily online (no physical stores) so I had it shipped to where we were staying (saves a lot on shipping and taxes). Being a coffee nerd aside, this watch is the best value I’ve ever gotten from a watch. It wears great and has a really unique design. 

**Kuoe Old Smith 90-002 Bronze (35mm with brown strap)** 

I got this at their showroom in Kyoto. When I looked at their designs online, none of them really spoke to me so I decided not to visit them during our time in Japan. Last minute, I changed my mind and I’m glad I did. The case size (35mm) and field watch design looked so good on my thin wrist. I also never had a bronze watch, so the weight makes it feel rugged. I’m excited to see it patina over time. 

Overall, I think I lean more towards these retro/vintage inspired microbrands because of my small wrists (6inch / 150mm).

💬Bright blood orange, sweet and slightly creamy, dries down to anise scent with no more traces of orange. I don't like this one as much as I thought I would, probably because the blood orange didn't stay put.


A Witch's Valentine: Marshmallow, Moroccan rose absolute, raspberry puree, white chocolate, the softest suede *floral gourmand

💬A straight forward vanilla and I can't smell much else. I've been using my WTF and becoming anosmic, so taking a break and will come back to this later. Right now I feel underwhelmed with what I can smell and somewhat disappointed.

Moon Magic: Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord) *spiced gourmand 


💬Lavender but not medicinal, creamy, a sweet biscuit that smells of chai. I'm not a lavender fan but don't try to actively avoid either, the lavender lingers but I still like it. I think if it was a chai cookie and more marshmallow I would probably really like this.


2 AM in Lafayette: Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar *earthy gourmand 


💬 sitting in a coffee shop reading my smut books while my bitter expresso wafts in the air, then ribbons of caramel rise above as I get to the juicy part of my book, a warm donut with powdered sugar nearby. I don't usually like coffee scents but I like this one very much! Some coffee scents I've tried in the past were too cloying once the caramel starts coming in, this one is just right. Not a scent I would usually choose.


English Major: library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute (sustainably harvested), carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves *earthy gourmand

WELL I HAVE A SOLUTION!!!

I call it: ""Bonnie's Gift Hunt!""

You have a big pixel map, similar to beta FNaF World's overworld design (top-down perspective), and you try to find gifts, depending on how many gifts you found, you get either a character and a win screen, or you lose.

The map consists of a Pizzeria (genius, I know [#sarcasm]), and the gifts are hidden under counters you can interact with, in boxes, in attractions, under tables, in the toilet, etc. iykyk.

You can also find ""junk"". This ""junk"" does nothing. It's basically ""what you found is not a gift.""

Then, we have like... 27 different spots an item can be found at. All 27 spots are always filled. 9 of them will be gifts! The other 18? JUNK. Each attempt has randomizes which items are gifts, and which aren't.

Each item (no matter if gift or junk) is marked by a small star. You can pick the item up with space and move with WASD.

If you gather all 9 gifts while there is still time left, the game ends anyway.

You have a time limit of 1 minute. (or 1:30 mins, I'm unsure which is fairer... suggest a better time limit if you like.) And so the timer is not stupidly unfair, you have a ""menu screen"" with a start button, and the controls/objective listed: ""Move with WASD, interact with space, and find as many gifts as you can!""

Your player character is also Bonnie. This is because Foxy is playable in Foxy Fighters, Freddy is playable in Freddy in Space, and Chica is playable in Chica's Magic Rainbow! That way all 4 of the FNaF 1 animatronics are playable. (Technically they still are, since you play as Bonnie in Foxy.exe, but this new game has Bonnie in the title, so each playable character is in their minigame's title as well now.)

Now, we gotta come up with rewards.

Let's assume this COULD replace Foxy.exe in FNaF World: Refreshed (since the OG game is a lost cause, sadly.)

We would have the other minigames giving us:
FiS: Coffee, Purple Guy, Jack o' Bonnie

He hates that I know more things than him about the JP environment (I've been here for more than 4 years now) and he hates that I'm right most of the time. He is constantly micro-managing me for the most stupid and irrelevant shit and it's unbearable at this point.  
Anyways, today I have a great example of his dynamic: My shift ends at 6pm, therefore I logged myself out from the phone at 5:30, AS WE ALWAYS DO. AS IT IS COMPANY DIRECTED. After closing some shit, I walked away from my desk and went to prepare some coffee, which took about 10 minutes. When I arrived, my tech lead (not him, another person) had sent me text messages asking me where I was, so at that moment I checked Teams and saw that 5 minutes earlier they had sent me a message about a case (nothing urgent, it was already sorted).  
I was surprised, like wow, it took 10 minutes for me to reply and you are messaging me? This is my break. So I asked my leader what's going on and they said: ""nothing, I just wanted to check if everything's ok with you since you appear as away in Teams for 2 hours"". I was shocked because I WAS THERE.  
Not even a minute later, my manager pinged me asking me what's going on and I said, ""hey, no worries, I just spoke with (tech lead) since I was away for a bit"", to which he replies: ""away? away for two hours?""  
You can't imagine how angry I was because our relationship is bad in general, but I could already feel his tone. I replied: ""no, I wasn't away for 2 hours, I was away for 15 minutes. I don't know why Teams is showing that"" AND HE REPLIES: ""but you aren't on the phone either"". So I said: of course I wasn't on the phone. I disconnected at 5:30. We all do. As company directed. Aaaand he never replied to that :)  
Side note, I know precisely why that happens, but I'm sure that if I try to explain the technical part to him (I've been a tech there for 3 years) he won't believe me and will prefer his narrative where I was not working or idk. (btw it's a known issue with Win10 in Teams that does not refresh)  
It's sickening. This always makes me cry because he never believes what I say and prefers to think that I suck at everything. This is not good for my self-esteem, but atm I can't find anything better.

For a long time, I didn’t have the words for what I wanted. I only knew what I *didn’t* want.  
I didn’t want to feel like a spectacle.  
I didn’t want to be watched, debated, or reduced to a moment of surprise.

I just wanted to live.

I’m based in Bengaluru. I step out, plan outings, go on trips, sit in public spaces, take photos when the light feels kind. Most of the time, nothing unusual happens. No drama. No confrontation. And slowly, I realised how rare and comforting that felt.

Crossdressing, for me, was never about standing out. It was about settling in.

When I dress, I’m not preparing for an audience. I’m choosing clothes the same way anyone else does, based on comfort, mood, and how I want to feel that day. Soft fabrics. Familiar silhouettes. Makeup that feels like an extension of my face, not a mask.

When I step outside, I’m not carrying an explanation with me. I’m thinking about where I’m going, whether I’ll find good coffee, how long the traffic might take, what I want to do with the rest of my day. Life things. Ordinary things.

There’s a lot of fear around being visibly feminine in India, and I understand where it comes from. I carried it too. But over time, my experiences taught me something gentler. Most people are busy living their own lives. When you move through the world calmly, without apology, the world often responds in kind.

That doesn’t mean I’ve never felt nervous. It doesn’t mean every moment has been easy. But it does mean that normalcy is possible when you stop treating yourself like an exception.

I didn’t want crossdressing to be something I escaped into occasionally. I wanted it to sit naturally inside my everyday life. To exist alongside errands, trips, conversations, quiet evenings, and ordinary routines.

And that’s what it became.

My journey isn’t dramatic. It doesn’t have big turning points or shocking moments. It’s made up of small, consistent choices to show up as myself, softly and steadily. To trust that I deserve space in the world without having to earn it through courage or performance.

If there’s one thing my experiences have taught me, it’s this.  
Normalcy isn’t something society hands you. It’s something you slowly allow yourself to claim.

I’m not trying to make a statement.  
I’m just living my life, honestly.

And sometimes, that’s more than enough.",1,1767156326.0,crossdressingIndia,0,0.99,False

Go for a walk, take yourself on a date, hike, or just find a quiet spot to think. I actually really like being alone. It feels calm. It feels mature. It feels free.

But after seeing some things up close, that idea started to shake.

I know someone who used to go out alone all the time. Small stuff. Coffee, walks, running errands. Then being alone started causing problems. She got followed, harassed, more than once. One time, a man exposed himself and tried to get her into his car. After that, she stopped going out alone. Not because she suddenly hated being alone, but because she was scared.

I remember hearing her talk about it. Not dramatic, just tired, like she was talking about the weather. She said she wished being alone was safe, but sometimes it just isn’t. She started carrying pepper spray, paying more attention to her surroundings, planning escape routes.

Later, another woman casually mentioned that her dog solved the problem. Big dog. Loud bark. She even encouraged single women to get one. Now when she hikes or camps, she’s less scared. She called it her warning system. The way she said it was light, but it stuck with me.

I felt a mix of things. Sad, a little angry, kind of confused. No one was blaming anyone. No one said men are evil. It was just… reality. Independence, but with conditions.

It made me realize how rarely women actually get to be alone. We’re always calculating. Adding something. A dog. A spray. A call. A lie about meeting someone soon. Not to feel powerful. Just to feel okay.

I know men face danger too. Really. But this felt different. Quieter. Ongoing. Like the cost of independence only becomes obvious when you live it.

I don’t have a clear takeaway. I just don’t like how freedom for women often comes with so many strings attached. And I’m not sure if we should try to change it, accept it, or just keep quietly working around it.",10,1767155893.0,I_DONT_LIKE,17,0.71,False

It’s a masterclass in how to cheer up neutral decor

By Amy BradfordDecember 18, 2025

Photo: Marco Pinarelli

Redesigning a home from scratch is always a daunting task, but for architect Jeffrey Meawad, founder of JM Design & Architecture, this Beirut apartment had extra emotional resonance. It was the childhood home of fashion and lifestyle influencer Kika Fourzali, who now lives here with her husband and two children. “The apartment is in the heart of Achrafieh, in a chic neighbourhood with an old-Beirut feel,” says the designer. “The project was less about discovering a new space and more about reimagining somewhere that already carried memories.”

There was little from the old Beirut apartment, which is part of a post-war building, that was worth saving, but that became the opportunity for a fresh start. “We gutted everything – ceilings, floors, partitions,” remembers Meawad. “We opened up the layout, corrected proportions, and rebuilt the architectural language from scratch. It was a complete reset, which gave us the freedom to craft the space exactly the way it needed to be.” Fourzali and her husband are a young, creative couple, and this shaped the spirit of the home. “Their life is energetic, social, and very family-centric, and that rhythm shaped the way the space needed to function for them and their two children,” explains Meawad.

The couple had no strict brief for the decor – something that the Beirut-based architect says he enjoys – but they did have some goals in mind. “They wanted a contemporary home with character; something timeless, but with soul,” says the designer. “The goal was to build a home that feels familiar but elevated, warm yet clean.” It also helped that Fourzali is “obsessed” with Parisian apartment living, specifically “the elegance, restraint, and effortless charm.” “That became the starting point,” Meawad continues. “But instead of simply recreating a Paris apartment, we elevated the idea.”


That meant “a material palette that ages well and feels naturally luxurious”: think flooring in snow-white Thassos marble from Greece, laid in a herringbone pattern (“a nod to Parisian style, but richer and more architectural”); contemporary oak panelling (“to soften the space’s brightness and add warmth”); and “subtle classical cues reinterpreted in a modern way”, such as the bespoke fireplace in Calacatta Arabescato marble, whose ribbed finish recalls traditional columns (the detail reappears on bathroom vanities).

The three-bedroom apartment now plays host to a wealth of eye-catching features, starting with the sculptural Breccia Viola marble console which Meawad placed in the entrance, alongside a bold black-and-white artwork by Charlie Oscar Patterson and, hanging opposite, a wood-embellished mirror by Éditions Levantine. “The console is the perfect introduction to the apartment’s identity,” says Meawad. Directly facing it is a modern interpretation of a winter garden, planted with cacti and framed with arched glass partitions. These arched forms became a theme of the décor. “They soften transitions and give the home rhythm,” says Meawad.


One such detail is the custom-made, curved red marble DJ booth beside the fireplace (Fourzali’s husband is passionate about music and DJs regularly); another is the cocktail bar in the dining area, which is “both sculptural and functional.” Much of the furniture also has curved forms, including Tacchini’s coffee-coloured Julep sofa in the living room, the custom marble dining table, and Galotti & Radice’s bubble-like Bolle Stelo floor lamp. “I always gravitate toward pieces with character that bring soul to a space,” says Meawad. “A neutral, earthy palette forms the backdrop of the home, supporting a sense of serenity while allowing the bespoke features and curated pieces to shine.”


The designer engineered a series of subtle contrasts. The warm neutrals that dominate the décor are juxtaposed with colourful artworks, including a large canvas by American artist Adam Handler on the living room wall and a Hockney-esque painting by New Zealander Rob Tucker in the dining room. “They add a playful edge that balances the clean architectural base,” explains Meawad. Rounded furniture is made to feel more grown-up with crisp linear wall mouldings and an angular smoked-glass mirror that doubles as a partition between the principal bedroom and dressing room.

This project is a clear expression of how I think about space,” muses Meawad. “I want spaces to be beautiful even before the furniture arrives, with light, proportion and materiality already working together to create harmony. That’s why, here, you feel the impact of every surface and every volume. The family loves that the apartment preserves the emotional connection to a childhood home, yet feels completely transformed into a space that reflects who they are today.” @jeffreymeawadarchitect

Mind you, I'm not allowed to eat in my room because my dad told everyone I make a huge mess eating(I don't.) and my grandma didn't put my cousins in the room before I cleant it out, she put them on an air mattress in the living room. I was extremely upset and she didn't seem to care. But I was taught not to fight with elders so I just told my dad. He said to put my collectables in his room. I didn't want to because his room smells like grass and farts and there's literally piles of random stuff scattered around, but I did. This became a pattern. Everytime I came over something was messed with gone or broken, or someone left something and never picked it back up. One time, I walked in and she told me that my cousin was staying over for the week because he got in trouble at school and I went in to him in his underwear on the bed with his feet on the pillows. I said I didn't want to sleep in there. She said that  she just washed the sheets and it didn't make sense why I didn't want to sleep in the bed. At that point I stopped wanting to stay over, so I started asking to just stay with my mom. This would really piss my dad and grandma off because they didn't understand why. But I knew if I told either of them they would just call me sensitive or say that I need to accept that the room isn't mine. Well one day, it was time for me to come over, and I asked my grandma if she could make sure my room was clean from any babies mess up everything. She never responded, but she told my dad. And my dad confronted me, and then told me that it was no longer my cousins messing up my room, but him. To watch the TV in my room. To clarify, though there's a TV in the livingroom, but my great grandfather passed last winter, so they put the tv in ""my"" room. The tv in his is mounted on a wall but it's broken. At that point I stopped even trying to clean the room. It wasn't my mess, It wasn't my fault that the room and bed were messed up and dirty, so I just stopped. All I did was wash the sheets I had to sleep on. Then my grandma would question me saying that she just washed the sheets and I need to stop being selfish because the room is everyones and that it's Grandma's house so everyone should be able to stay over. But I don't understand why I should have to stay over if I don't even have a place to keep my stuff. I'm here half the time, and everyone who sleeps in that room has their own bed to sleep in. Their own house. I HAVE to be here half of the time I don't get to just stay over once every few weeks and leave. Well, it only got worse from there. I'd come back to his dirty clothes and underwear scatter on the floor, dirty towels shirts and blankets balled on the bed and stuff pushed to the floor, including my blankets. There would also be dirty cups cans and random items place on the nightstand and dirty clothes and random items on my piano.. Then my sister stopped wanting to stay with her mom because they would fight a lot, so she put all he stuff in my room. She also doesn't like cleaning. Her mess takes up the entire walkway in front of the bed. Again no one tells me or asks me, they just do it. Still keeps getting worse. All my stuff gets put into a closet, all my stickers go missing , and my sister starts putting her stuff on the dresser. Where did my stuff go? Idk. My poster I never got to put up is bent in half because they put a bunch of stuff on it. They put dirty towels in my clean clothes basket which is in the closet. I got some makeup brushes for christmas and I put them on the nightstand. I cameback after a day and they were knocked down and scattered on the floor out of the box. I didn't even open them yet. My dad drove us out of town once and it took us 3 hours to get home. We got back at 11. I was ready to go to lay down and go to sleep. He takes my remote to turn on football and sits on the floor eating fish. I bought some coffee grinds and put them in the cabinet. A few weeks later, I find them frozen in the freezer. I barely even come over now because looking at my missing and messed with stuff makes me wanna cry. They reset the TV because I locked YouTube so they'd stop messing with it. Now it's winter break. Spent a week with my mom, now I'm with my dad. I've barely been here for two days and my grandma comes in and hands me some freshly washed sheets and tells me to remake the bed. The bed that has someone else's dirty towels on it, my blankets shoved to the floor, and the comfort shoved to the side with some kind of make-shift sheets. The beds looked like this since I last saw them weeks ago but the moment I come over all of a sudden I have to fix it. My grandma acts like I should clean the entire room every time I come over. But when I di, it was completely messed up by the time I came back because no one even bothered to clean their mess. If I accidentally move a blanket from the couch in the livingroom I'll get chewed out for not cleaning my mess, but no one cares when it's this room. If I leave to go get water and  come back to the room my dad will be laid out in my bed and my sister with the remote with her hands. I wouldn't even care if they took the TV they can have it. But I can't even have privacy. And the worst part is they don't even notice. They'll laugh and play and joke but have the nerve to ask me what's wrong. But if I say anything my dad just says I'm being sensitive or selfish. He doesn't even knock. Or he'll open the door before he does. I just wanna take all my stuff and go to my mom's but i don't have enough room there. Sorry if this got long or messy, but I'm really upset right now because it's gotten to the point where I dread coming home from an outing because I know when I go inside and I just want to relax they'll be there. I just want my dad to care about my space or my feelings. Or at least to move out. I love him and want to see him but I'm genuinely miserable over here. That's all. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Sorry it's so long, just needed to vent.",3,1767155591.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

My body and mind are exhausted. I didn’t do anything to be that tired. I prepared for the day. My brother and I decided after our father’s funeral we would do something special for his birthday every year. He would have been 71 today. He passed this March. We both drank a cup of coffee and ate one of his favorite pastries. I prepared for this by going to my favorite bakery and getting the perfect apple turnover to celebrate for him yesterday. I just miss him so much. I miss being able to call and wish him happy birthday. We lived in different states, so I haven’t gotten to spend his birthday with him in forever, but we always called or facetimed. Talked about our plans for our spring garden and ask how he liked his gifts we sent him. I always try to surprise him with something extra, mostly a favorite snack that I would get him in bulk to enjoy for a while. My dad is what I lovingly refer to as a snack monster. Getting up at 2-3 in the morning to have a little sweet treat and I wanted to always make sure he had his favorites. I just miss him so much. I dont even know where I am going with this. I just know that today was so hard and I just wish he was still here. I feel like this will never get easier. It was our first year without him. It just feels empty and lonely. I just really want my dad back. Happy birthday dad. I love you so much.",4,1767155441.0,GriefSupport,0,0.84,False

I need ideas for this space since it has so many open doors and areas etc I am struggling to plan a cozy setting. Here are some things I already have in mind: 

I plan to change the rug, would get a bigger one in some warm tone. 
Add a small coffee table. 
Also planning on getting a dining table for six. Maybe a bookrack. 


What to do with this space? Any ideas on how to set this up. Thanks",1,1767155199.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1q03o8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q03o8w/i_thought_that_call_was_over_then_i_heard_it_again/,I Thought That Call Was Over — Then I Heard It Again,"Most people think once something weird ends, it’s done. Memories fade. Screens clear. Old calls scroll out of sight.

That’s not how this worked.

It started two nights after the active call from that address — the one we never resolved, the one with two simultaneous lines and the voice that sounded wrong — the station was quiet. Too quiet. Graveyard shift, slow shuffle of paperwork, the usual half‑hearted attempts at coffee. I had my headset off for the first time in hours.

Then the headset clicked on by itself.

No call tone. No ringing. Just connected.

I put it on like a dumb habit.

“911, what’s your emergency?” I said out of instinct.

There was breathing.
That slow, controlled breathing — like someone pacing their own heartbeat.

Then a voice I’d never heard before said:

“I heard your voice before.”

I froze.

Not because of what was said, but how it was said.

It didn’t sound afraid.
It didn’t sound frantic.

It sounded… familiar.

Like someone who had listened for years.

I checked the line number.

Blank.
No caller ID.
No trunk line.
Just an active call — already in progress — with no record of having been dialed.

My blood went cold.

“Sir,” I said slowly, “are you safe right now?”

There was a pause. Then the breathing changed: slow exhale, as if someone was leaning back and relaxing.

“I am now,” the voice said.

My eyes went to the system screen.

A new active call entry showed up. Timestamp: 2:17 a.m.
Location: DISPATCH CENTER
Caller Number: Unknown
Status: Open

The system was showing me as the caller.

I didn’t hit anything. I hadn’t made a call.

I stared at it.

Then I heard something else through the headset.

Soft footsteps. Bare feet. Slow.

Like someone was pacing behind me in the dispatch room.

I turned around.

Nothing there.

“Sir,” I said into the headset, “can you tell me where you are?”

A chuckle. Calm. Quiet.

“No. But I’m close.”

Another breath.
Another slow footstep, but this time it echoed in the audio — behind the voice.

I pressed Mute on my mic to check if it was local.

The footsteps didn’t stop.

That’s when the voice spoke again — right into the mic, not through the phone system:

“You remember me.”

My headset buzzed violently, like a feedback loop.

Then — silence.

Everything froze.

The active call entry blinked and disappeared.

No log.
No record.
No sound.

Just the hum of fluorescent lights.

I sat there, trembling, waiting for dispatch to catch up.

Then the headset clicked off.

Like nothing had happened.

I looked around the empty station.

And I noticed something on my monitor I hadn’t seen before:

A third open call, timestamped 2:17 a.m.,
With the label:

“DISPATCHER — UNKNOWN LOCATION.”

I stared at it for a long time.

Then, slowly, the line reconnected.

No ringing. No caller ID.

Just breathing.

Slow. Controlled.

Too close.

“911,” I whispered, “what’s your emergency?”

The same calm voice I’d heard before said,
“…You have a new caller.”

And right then — something tapped, very gently, on the back of my chair.

Not heavy. Not loud.

Just there.

Like it was waiting for me to acknowledge it.

And then the breathing changed — not through the headset —
but behind me.

Slow. Measured.

Like someone breathing into the back of my neck.

I didn’t turn around.

Because I already knew the shape of what was there.

Because it wasn’t just a call anymore.

It was watching.",0,1767154952.0,creepypasta,0,0.5,False
