1irba8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1irba8q/what_does_prozac_feel_like/,What does prozac feel like?,"Ive had my prescription sitting on my nightstand for 2 months, I havent taken any medication in 4 years, not even Tylenol.

I have an extreme fear of consuming things, I *only* drink water - and I only eat bread, meat, fish and cheese. (Yes its hell)

Even the thought of drinking juice, milk, coffee, tea, gatorade, flavoured water, sparkling water, tap water or the thought of eating chocolate, fruits, vegetables, sweets etc sends me into panic.

The fear comes from being a drug user when i was a younger. Im 19M, sober, 190lbs, diagnosed with aspergers, OCD, ARFID, and PTSD

Anyways, my main fear right now is what it feels like DIRECTLY AFTER taking prozac, like the first 8 hours. Does it feel like anything? Will I feel side affects in 20 minutes? Or tomorrow? Even just dizziness, or a weird feeling, or a headache, or nausea, please tell me if you felt ANY different moments after taking it ..",1,1739765538.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

As for the Title of this post, I believe this to be the main cause of the common relapse, an idle mind, an idle mind which inevitably begins searching for any form of stimulation, in this case, porn, even if all the videos are closed, the media exposure is limited, the mind will eventually fold into itself and begin to create fantasies or trying to recreate the videos that you once thought were long gone, time will begin to drag and drag with these temptations eventually reaching a potential boiling point until, relapse. The best method to conquer these urges and thoughts pr to prevent them all together is to become active and stay active, even if it be something as small as washing the dishes or dusting your nearest coffee table, so long as you are not focusing on the time at hand and are keeping yourself active and distracted, this entire healing process will be made much simpler, not to mention the other self benefits you'd receive from said productivity.

1irb476,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1irb476/bring_me_a_dream/,Bring me a dream.,"I haven’t slept well lately. It’s not a particularly uncommon problem, but I am afraid my cause might be a bit abnormal. Falling asleep happens easily enough. It’s more of an issue of staying asleep. Over the past few days, what happens when I wake in the night has a death grip on my psyche.

A few days ago, I came downstairs to see my wife, Katie, drinking coffee while our toddler kept herself entertained with a cardboard box. I poured a mug of morning elixir. I slightly kicked at the box and hopped around the child.

“Caroline, we could save a fortune giving you boxes to play with instead of toys.”

“I am surprised you are up already,” Katie raised her eyes and looked over her mug.

I stretched in my seat “Well, I like to sleep in but it’s not exactly early.”

“Yeah, but you tossed and turned all night,” Katie replied as she rinsed her mug.

“Par for the course,” I laughed. Nights of rest were long gone before having children, let alone after. Waking up in the night in panic, checking a monitor for the relief of safety. Questioning shadows in the dark or if the door locks were steadfast in their duty. Last night was one of hundreds, and thousands yet to come.

“Sure, but why did you do that arm thing, you wouldn’t stop”. She looked at me, slightly confused, maybe even concerned. The cardboard box was loudly being ripped across by a green colored pencil as Caroline had decided to decorate.

  
“Arm thing? What are you talking about?” Suddenly, I shifted uneasy as my shoulder felt a bit stiff.

I had no clue what she could have meant. I couldn’t recall the dreamless night before. Not unlike nights ahead. I may not sleep like a log, but I couldn’t remember waking up, let alone doing something during the night.

Katie chuckled “I turned over and you had your arm pointed straight up in the air”.  
  
“Huh, like my fingers pointed straight up?”  
  
“No, more like limp wristed,” she replied with a demonstration. She slid down her chair, sat her mug down and raised on arm up. Caroline let out a giggle, laid down and raised both her arms up while kicking her legs. “No no no!”

  
“I guess that’s sorta odd,” I shrugged with a chuckle at Caroline’s display. Now she had gotten on all fours and started snorting heavily. “See! See!”

I had bouts of sleepwalking when I was younger, slammed my nose directly into a door frame, woken up to falling into my bed. I suppose hanging my arm up wasn’t that far of a stretch.

Nothing to worry about, all sorts of weird instincts and functions happen when you sleep. My arm probably fell asleep from laying on it. The more I thought about it, the more I felt the ache in my shoulder. I rotated it a few times around feeling it pop.

“I probably just slept on it,” I told her, finishing up my last bit of coffee.

“Yeah, probably. When are we leaving to go to the park?” Katie asked as she picked up Caroline.

“Whenever, I just need to get dressed.”



 

Barring some tantrums over leaving the park, the day progressed in tranquility. I didn’t even give our conversation a second thought. It burrowed far into the recess of my mind.

After we came home and I spent some time coaxing a small child to sleep with fantasy tales of princesses and the knights that rescue them from wicked creatures, Katie and I spent some time on the couch and went to begin the bedtime routine.

“Luke, don’t tell Caroline scary stories, I get that you like scary stuff but she’s still little.”  
  
I was in the middle of changing my clothes when Katie spoke. It had taken a moment to process the censure. She sat with her back against the backboard arms crossed waiting for my retort.  
  
“What? Scary stories? I don’t think a rescued princess is that scary.”

“You’re going to scare her, some of the stuff she repeats are a bit much.”  
  
I had no idea what she meant. Katie could find worry in fresh cut grass if it were to acquaint with Caroline.  
  
“Like a giant killer shark?” I replied, shaking my knees with feigned fear.

“I am serious,” she glared to confirm the statement.

“Sure honey, I will tone it down,” I reassure as we lie down. As I kissed her cheek and felt the comfort of the blanket, I thought to adapt less monsters and more villains moving forward with the bedtime wonders.

“Where did you come up with it anyway?”  
  
“With what?”  
  
“The monster you told her about last night.”

Last night, I regaled Caroline with a story about a fur footed girl traveling with a handsome wizard, they happened to look strikingly like Caroline and myself. They unfortunately ran into large hungry trolls. The descriptions of the snarls and hunger for flesh must have stuck with her.  
  
“That would be my fantastic creativity.”  
  
“Yeah, okay, and when she watches those movies she is going to know what a thief you are.”



 

Sure enough, the next morning came as it always did. My phone wailed out in distress, I silenced it and began to wrestle with the exhaustion in my eyes. First things first, I stared at the baby monitor and found our little girl still sleeping, safe and sound. No dreams of sharks, trolls or even dragons.

Abandoning the warmth of my bed I convinced my body to make my way to her room. After I turned the knob, I felt my hand slide around the metal. Looking down at my hand there was a powdery black substance that had smeared on my hand. It kind of looked like ash or soot. Did we have something on our hands when we closed the door? Maybe some sort of oil in the handle was leaking out? I wasn’t sure. I wiped my hand across a pant leg, the interruption escaping my thoughts.

I opened Caroline’s door, not trying to be very loud but not quiet either. She is lying in her small bed, supporting her entire body with her head as usual.

“Good morning honey, you ready for breakfast?” my voice interrupted the silence of the room. I gave her a gentle shake and brushed her hair.  
  
The sheets slightly jerked on the bed as she stirred and then yawned, expelling the night from her body. I kept soothing her awake as I looked around her room. She had left her closet door open; she had been found guilty of getting out of bed during the night and roaming around her room. A reasonable deduction as I noticed some of her toys watching me out of the dark of the door.

I stood up and opened the door and began pushing the toys back out of the opening. On the hardwood, I discovered more ash.

“Huh, Caroline did you break a crayon? It’s all over the floor.”  
  
“No dada” she slurred as she sat up.

Kids lie, maybe they’re afraid of punishment, maybe because it just makes sense to them in the moment. Who knows why.

“Okay, well baby, when you make a mess, you need to let mommy or daddy know. You got, whatever, this is on our door too.”

Caroline waddled over to me and pulled my leg. “I didn’t daddy. Baa baa did”.

I picked her up, making sure that she didn’t get any of the mess on her. Nothing too bad, just a bit her feet. Staring at the floor I could find the evidence where she had tracked it to her bed. We head out of her room towards the kitchen. “Well, Baa baa needs to tell me.”  
  
“He will.”

Kids are weird, and they otherwise do or say outright creepy things. After dealing with it for years you stop really thinking about it. We go back to my bedroom and gently, as gentle as a child can be, we wake up Katie and eat breakfast before I must go to work.





During work hours find it in themselves to move slowly. I kept a healthy dose of caffeine to keep the exasperation at bay. The drive home would have been as mundane as any other time if it weren’t for the detour thrust upon me.

Wipers swiped across my windshield, erasing away the rain that pouring down. I had just came over a hill to find there is a commotion impeding everyone’s drive home. An older man in a yellow jacket was waving everyone to take a left up the hill. A slight backroad that shortly circled back to the main road after a ways. I usually keep to myself but eyeing this scene stirred something in me to be a bit nosey. As I slowly came up the man I rolled down my window, paying the price in rain battering my face.

“Hey! What’s going on?”

The man raised his hand to his mouth to speak over the weather, “A bunch of pigs broke out of a truck and started running into the river! They are all over the road! Someone totaled their car into one of them! Go!”

The man waves me off to the turn. He had no more time for explanation. Pulling up the road slowly I peak over my passenger side to try to make out the scene. I have heard a tale or two in my life but cannot say that suicidal pigs were something I was familiar with. 

There was a truck with a livestock trailer with the gate ruptured open, no doubt from the escape of the herd. A small white sedan sat crumpled against one of the beasts. Its corpse had erupted over the hood like sausage burst from its casing.

A woman held her head with a cloth as she overlooked the damage to her vehicle. A man, the herdsmen maybe, stood on the side of the road staring at the legion of animals that had made it to the water. If he was upset, he hid it well. He just stood there, arms hanging to his sides, vacant expression and eyes sunken.

After the detour, it was the journey as usual. We repeated our cozy routine. Ate dinner, played games with Caroline making up rules as befitting of her victory, and within short order it was time to put her to bed.

This time I told her the story about a man who must save his wife from a bunch of bad men in a skyscraper. Adding as much silliness as I can for a small child’s amusement. After she is tucked in, I made my way to the exit.  
  
“Daddy I want a good dream.”

“I am sure you will one baby.” I waited at the door to entertain the jovial questioning that tends to prolong going to sleep.

“Do you have good dreams?” She yawns out her question.

“Daddy doesn’t have dream honey. When I was younger, I got hurt and now daddy doesn’t really dream anymore,” I confessed to her.

“Ohh,” she tiredly replies, most likely not understanding what I said.

“I dream a lot,” she disclosed as she turns to get a better look at me. “My dreams talk about you daddy.”

I softly smiled “Well, I am glad you dream of me sweetie”.

“No daddy, my dreams talk about you, I don’t see you.”

“Oh? And do they tell you about how strong and handsome I am?” with a soft chuckle I leaned on the frame waiting for her answer.

“They told me to ask you about your dreams.”

“Ha, well like I said honey, I don’t really dream.”  
  
Just a few days prior she had asked me if I see through my own eyes, or do I see my full body like she does. Children are full of learning and trying to comprehend reality around them. At the time it just seemed like one of those times. The only reason it is obviously strange now is due to the events that proceeded it. Today, I would question everything even slightly odd.  
  
“Maybe that’s good,” Caroline yawned once more, and I knew it was my cue to let her drift off.



 

Katie and I eventually go to sleep after some short chatter. As for what I told Caroline, when I was about 5 years old, I got clipped by a car. I was in the hospital for weeks; my skull was cracked alongside several other injuries. As I recovered, it appeared that aside of no longer having dreams, I would be relatively normal. The doctors told my parents that all things considered, it was the best outcome from such a severe head injury. I can’t complain, I would trade dreams for an able body. There were talks of long term affects and I have routinely been through scans and follows up my whole life to make sure we can catch any further complications should they arise.

There was the issue of how I got clipped by the car, the driver swore that I ran into her. According to her, I wasn’t playing or chasing, I just ran into the cars path. She swore that she had seen me standing beside the road, that I was obviously following the traffic visually. Then as she got too close to stop, I jumped in front of her car. If it had been an SUV or a Truck, I probably wouldn’t have problems sleeping today. But with her small sedan, I rolled up and over the hood, cracking her windshield as she slammed her brakes. She made no effort to abandon me and was the first to call for an ambulance. To this day I am sure she hadn’t done any wrongdoing.

I do not know why I ran out in front of her car, most of my childhood prior to the accident is fogged either by youth or the trauma of the accident itself. My parents said I slipped out of the door, sneaking out like kids tend to do. According to them they were carrying in groceries and one moment later I was no longer playing with toys on the floor.

There was some minor strife as the state had assigned a case worker to make sure my home was safe and proper. Outside of some cases of bruises, that everyone assured was due to the accident, the case worker found nothing to be alarming. Life went back to normal, and I grew up healthy and fine, albeit without a single fantasy to keep my slumbering mind busy.

This night though, I found myself dreaming.



  

For a nameless reason, my eyelids sparked open, allowing the darkness of the room to obscure my vision. I looked over and could make out Katie sleeping beside me and I began to shift my weight over to my side. Only, I couldn’t.

Quick unease stirred in me. My eyes scan around, I seen a hand floating above my chest. My arm suspended above me, just as Katie claimed. I pulled it down to my side, at least the command struck from my mind, but my body quietly ignored it. My unease was becoming panic. I couldn’t move.

I kept trying to move any part of myself, only my eyes would obey. In my mental fumbling, my vision found something, something that shouldn’t have been there. In the doorway, they sat. I uselessly think to shout out to Katie.

“Luke.”

I would have jumped and screamed if only my nerves listened. Rectangle pupils surrounded in a sea of yellow flood into the room. Not one pair, but several.

“You have stolen from me.”

The voice is terribly beautiful. As it envelops me, it is the voice of a father, an elder, a lover, and a child. Separately, simultaneously. I realized that I want to hear it again, while desperately praying that for it to never find the desire to break silence again. It is awesome. It is horrific.

The orbs shift so slightly forward, different pairs took their turns blinking. They cover the unseen body. They move independently from one another but of the same body. As one pair dance towards me, another flanks. Too far beneath them a maw revealed. A mouth, perhaps, of sharp teeth glistened in the dark. Spittle seeped from the black tongue that flicked between the razors.

“Not only have you stolen time. With it, you created more”.  
  
I clasped my eyes shut, this was just a dream. My first dream in many years of course would be a nightmare. Shortly it would be gone. My hopes would not realize quickly enough, as I heard a slap of flesh, a scraping across my floor. I felt several spots of warm breath hitting my face.

“You haven’t any more time Luke”. The voice ripped into my body. I heard drips fall on the floor. I could only smell the consistent effect of sea water and wet fur. But with each source of breath, slamming against my body blowing my hair around. A hunt of decay, like that of meat that has been left out in the heat, an unfortunate animal baking on the roadside from hours ago. 

My heart is racing towards an unknown goal. I can feel my breathing getting more and more shallow. I can feel my own conscious escaping my brain. A barrage of horns scream and steel clash.  


My useless arm joins its twin as my shoulders force me up.  A command not from my own thoughts. The sounds do not relent, I knew that I was pleading for my body to stop. I knew that something else was quietly, politely even, declining. I felt the furnace of the beasts breathes scorching across my face. My heart pounds much too hard and in a frantic rhythm. Bile coated my throat. The lids of my eyes only just govern my vision. My head looked only forward. My eyes pushed as far as they could to the side of the bed, just barely failing to find their mark.

“There is much atrophy.”

The beast’s conclusion is only slightly decipherable through the noise. As suddenly as it rose, I felt my body thrash back to the bed. My head found its new position, I couldn’t see Katie. Why had she not woken up to free me? I rolled my eyes back and forth looking for the beast. Fear argued with itself as I wasn’t sure I wanted to find it.

The sea slowly fading from the room, the trumpets concluding their play, in the doorway once more, I finally found the collective of wet yellow eyes peering. The mass that they belong to was released.

“Do not prefer delusion to truth, Luke,” only the eyes remain. The terrific, beautiful voice only just yet lost its daunting volume, “I shall yet leave the sea.”



 

“Luke! Luke Get up!” Katie shouts, shaking me free of my paralyzed state.

I dart my eyes open, my mouth drawing as much air as my lungs will hold.  “Holy shit, Jesus”.

“Its 8:30 Luke, you are going to be late, hurry and get up”. Katie pushes me up to get out of bed. I struggle to return to the monotonousness of reality.  
  
“I, I uh, had a dream. A nightmare actually”. I spewed out in a flurry as I began to get dressed. Katie just made a slightly confused face.  
  
“I thought you didn’t do that?” She said as she threw an article of clothing at me before turning to look at the monitor. “Caroline is still asleep”.

“I don’t. I don’t know what changed”.  
  
“Well, text me when you get to work, I will go get Caroline for breakfast. I love you”. She handed me some socks and headed out the door.  
  
I quickly returned her love and finished dressing. I almost slip on the floor, something wet and viscous remains on my side of the bed. At the time it wasn’t lost on me that it was strange, but I was late for work and rent was a horror that I was much more familiar with.



 

I enjoy the occasional horror movie. I would like to say that I understand how annoying it is to see a character oblivious to obvious signs of something otherworldly. You will have to forgive my dense reaction to that night. Logic and rationale of a mind conditioned to the norm, are not so easily shaken. Despite what may be the truth, the only thing I wanted to do was find out why I began dreaming again.

A quick appointment with Dr. Elijah, with all the bells and whistles. The claustrophobic inducing voyage into metal monsters and hopefully promising results. In truth, with my experience, I could sleep through the process of these scans. This appointment I decided not to.

As I said brain injuries aren’t something you entirely ignore, you monitor long term effects and make sure nothing has gotten worse over time. This wasn’t such a case, to my surprise, Elijah was almost giddy when he had me indulge him across his walnut desk.

“Well Luke, I must say I rarely have seen something like this,” he put his elbows on the wood to lean forward, his creaking chair accompanied his words.

“You have no signs of ever suffering a head injury. If I hadn’t seen it before, you couldn’t convince me it ever even happened,” he held the papers in one hand as he rolled his shoulders, shaking his head in astonishment.

For all the joy that should have hatched in me, I found a cuckoo of indifference instead. I understood at that moment that it was indeed a blessed thing. Previous fears of not living to see grandchildren, or wishing that I hadn’t lived to forget them, had suddenly abandoned me. But, in the moment of the Doctors revelation, salt and brine filled my mouth and fire kissed my face.

Doctor Elijah smiled, with true glee and authenticity.

*If he was not crazy before, I’m sure saying the same sentence over and over again has made that very string of words into a lie, I force myself to recount the days that have passed, this is for the only purpose of remembering how many more I have to endure before leaving this wet and damp hellhole. I’m getting Déjà vu, every day waking up in the groups tent in the outskirts of town, taking a dump, walking through town waving to the locals, arriving at the other side of town, and entering the blocky run down local asylum… no, asylum would be too generous of a word to describe this place, what once used to be the old police precinct now turned a barely serviceable institution for the governor to embezzle the funding out of in the name of the people, nothing new in this kind of third world countries that always are at the equator for some reason.*

*With barely a few scraps left after the hyenas come this place cannot even afford the bare minimum to keep the 95-degree humid heat away, it’s a miracle that the few jail cells that remain, now converted into rubber rooms with rats all over do not cook the occupant on sight, we have an isolated wing and dense tree foliage to thank for that. However, that only means that the other side is but a pressure cooker, a pressure cooker built like a labyrinth that I need to attend for 6 hours a day in order to supervise one of the several new promising talents that our most magnanimous and precious university decided to send together with this expedition to the middle of the Latin American jungle in order to uncover a city that was recently spotted by one of those fancy satellites, I guess… that  just like the very things I dig up from the ground I too have become an old relic at my modest 43 years of age, oh how the time flies.*

*Now, about 10 seconds have passed, and like clockwork one of the 3 men in ill-fitting lab coats and shirts with convenience store cookies and buns before me should…*

“And I believe you, John, just tell me about the incident, please.”

*And John, that poor kid will answer.*

“For the last fucking time, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.”

*Oh, look at that, this time he actually changed the tune a bit, usually he usually insults their mothers too*

“Fine then, tell me about what happened 2 weeks ago.”

*2 weeks ago… has it truly been that long? the story is repeated the same way multiple times a day, repeated and repeated until the three stooges in front of me get sick of it, and even then I cannot truly believe it…*

*It was 3 days after our arrival to the community, after setting our camp a few minutes away from the excavation site and presenting ourselves to the locals we started mapping and doing a bit of exploration of the area, the mission was simple, to prove the presence of the remains of a city belonging to a long lost civilization in the area, should we find enough evidence then papers can be exchanged, permits obtained and politicians paid to ensure the excavation of the predicted site goes smoothly, and for that task there is no better workforce than some 20 or so eager young able bodied young men and women that in the need to prove themselves, gain experience for their thesis and most importantly have some fun away from the eyes and the scrutiny of home. And I cannot blame them, I was like them once, which is why I turn a blind eye to their escapades in the middle of the night to party or to “deepen” their relationship with the locals, as long as they work some hours extra in the field of course.*

*That day it was like any other, John, he is a… no, was a good kid so when I saw him leave for the shore I said nothing, hell I even gave him a beer, he was the hardest worker until then and showed genuine passion and care for this line of work, I thought that I finally had found someone worthy of inheriting the department head position after I retire in a few years, that’s why I could not believe my eyes when he returned covered in her blood.*

*“*Ok… fine… I will start from the beginning, maybe this time you will actually believe me.”

*The silence that followed was audible, broken by the start of a story that I already know for this truly might be the 100**^(th)* *time I hear it*

“It was like any other day, I had worked hard all week and decided I needed a break, so early in the morning, at about 6am I left camp with supplies I had prepared the day before and headed out to the shore I remember seeing in the maps of the area, I knew that it would be a long while until I got there, about some 3 to 4 hours by foot but I did not mind, I like being outdoors, I feel connected with nature in some way. But back at what I was saying, as I was heading out I met with the department head and he gave me something to drink along the way, I thanked him and went off.”

“Was he the only one you met that morning?”

“No, Amber… she… she always woke up earlier than most, as I was coming out of my tent I saw her preparing some of the equipment, she… asked me where I was going and I told her, I… invited her to come with me and she agreed, she said that she would join me later.”

“I see, continue then”

“The walk was uneventful, I strangely enough saw less animals than normal but I paid it no mind, but now that I think about it perhaps they were staying away from the coast, maybe I should have as well. When I arrived it was around 10 am or maybe 11, I didn’t really check, I planned to come back when the sun started to set anyways. As I walked along where the water met the sand I found a rocky cliff, and that, accursed box.”

“It was along the rocks that I found what seemed to be a broken wooden cargo box, the sort you see in big ships, the only difference being that it was made of wood, it had some sort of inscription on the side but the sea had erased some of it, I remember it clearly, DelPher port.”

“John, please, there is no major port in the area named DelPher, are you sure?”

“I am…maybe I misread it, there was a space between the name, perhaps more got erased than I thought, I don’t know I really don’t know, believe me I don’t know”

*That’s odd, he usually starts crying a bit later*

“John, continue, please”

*More silence, probably pulling themselves together*

“One side of the box had been broken into by the rocks, curiosity got the best of me, so I took my flashlight out and tried to see what was inside, I had used it a bunch before so I forgot to take the batteries out but I saw something inside, it was pale and cracked. So, I put my arm in and tried to take it out, nothing bit me surprisingly, and I managed to take something out”

“Could you please describe what was it you took out of the box?”

“Sure, I guess, it was some sort of chair leg, it was some sort of weird shape, starting a bit wider at the base and then narrowing a little by the end, it was a tad longer than my arm, and had a small ball in the narrower end, it felt as if it was made out of some weird mixture of ivory and porcelain, and when I saw it closer I also saw that there were multiple smaller cracks into the hollow interior alongside the bigger one that was across the entirety of its length”

“After I took it out I… don’t remember anything else, I just came to, out of breath near the camp, with Amber in my arms, and she, and she… look, I... I, I, listen I’m not crazy ok, you have to believe me! I would never hurt her! you hear me, IM NOT CRAZY!”

“Thank you John, I believe it would be best for everyone if we continue tomorrow.”

*Finally, I can leave that damned place, if only the day was not over by then, I have not advanced in the multiple reports and other paperwork I need to fill, but then again I’m sure no one could blame me, no matter how many times I hear that story I cannot help but think there is something else, he is not crazy I know that, and yet I cannot take them out of that accursed building, comes to show truly how powerless humans truly are. The walk back to the camp is always lonely but rarely silent, either by noises of the town or by something else.*

*It does not matter, for I always enter the research tent more tired than I have possibly ever been.*

“You look like shit Bobby.”

“You too Willow, still stuck in that rock of yours? Or should I ask if it has gotten stuck in you? oh wait that would imply you took your head out of there first.”

“Charming as ever are you? well then, I’m proud to inform you that I have gotten significant progress since you have decided to pay a visit to our resident madman, I have freed the grip, take a look and weep.”

*Willow is quite possibly one if not my only friend in this damp hell, going back all the way when I foolishly decided to pursuit my passion in archaeology instead of becoming a lawyer like mother wanted,, and compared to her tender age of 41 she aged remarkably well, she won’t share her secret no matter how much I nag, the banter we share is the only moment of respite I have while I’m still conscious, it was the same day that John caused the incident that she found a weird rock excavating in some nearby cliff, she claimed that there was a sword inside because of how it looked, I let her keep working on it, she has always had an eye for this sort of stuff. And I would truly weep for the pommel and extra bits of a sword was indeed visible, and that would mean that in a few moments 50 bucks would in turn become invisible from my wallet.*

“Yes, I suppose it is indeed a sword of some kind, but it makes little sense as to why it’s here considering the only places I have seen this sort of patterns was in the Han dynasty, are you sure you did not plant it there.”

“Believe me darling I don’t know how to time travel, and if I could I would not have placed something so obviously wrong in the middle of nowhere in the hopes that this expedition got greenlit in this exact place just so I could get pocket money out of you”

“Would you believe me if I said that I can see you doing that?”

“Yes, now pay up.”

*A long silence ensued after I gave her the money, I lit up a cigar, the supply I brought with me rapidly dwindling with how things are going.*

“I have not seen you like this since you accidentally broke that artifact back in Germany, or when you thought that spilling coffee into one of the professor’s papers would get you expelled, is everything alright?”

“You tell me, one of the kids in the loony bin and the other in a coma in the nearby clinic with the helicopter god knows how long away”

“I know, it just felt like I had to ask you, say do you truly believe he did it? that he is crazy?”

“At this point I don’t know, but if I had to say I don’t think he deserves to be there, crazy or not”

“Then why do you keep hesitating? You keep changing your mind at the last second every time, if you were to do it again it would be like the fifth time in a row”

*I was stalling, I wanted to say that he is not crazy, because I know he isn’t but my hands are tied by the powers that be, perhaps Willow could have handled it better, after all, I have never been the best with people and delicate situations, I know she said that she was too absorbed in her work to not have seen them, but I don’t really believe her, it just does not feel right, she was the one that was closest to Amber out of everyone here, they went together everywhere, hell I’m sure Amber could have even invited her to… hold on, what am I thinking there is no way, especially after seeing how obsessed she is over her damn rock, the heat is getting to me.*

*“*I’m done for today, I will go to sleep in the back, you going to stay with the rock?”

“It’s a sword, and yes I will stay late again, I really need to finish taking it out before it’s too late”

*I wanted to ask her what did she mean by that, but I was too tired to care.*

*The back is where we keep the most important stuff, tools, provisions, personal stuff and most importantly whatever is it we find after we dig it up, it’s called the back because of its location relative to the camp and despite its name its quite a bit far away, this little shed constructed of cheap ply wood and the most basics of doors is the only place where one can keep their privacy which is why its checked regularly to ensure no young ones are getting a bit too adventurous with the past. As of late, when the sun comes down and the moon shines bright it becomes my office, and my hell*

*John, I know you are not crazy, I know, because I am.*

*“*My my, you really hanged in there I thought you would go for a smoke break midway through the story like last time, are you getting invested? Any surprises you expect to find?”

*I look up to the ceiling, to meet my tormentor and my jailer, the reason why I know I have gone crazy for I know that no matter what I do no one can acknowledge its existence, if I had to describe them it was some sort of child wearing a suit and an apple haircut, with pink shiny eyes and a pale pinkish skin, they appeared one day after the incident, when I first tried to tell Willow about them they just stared at me in disbelief and muttered something about fatigue getting up to my head, after that I gave up on asking people, and it’s by the way that they never shut up that I know,  I’m truly alone in this.*

“What do you know? Is everything a game to you?”

“It’s not a game, it’s just that it’s funny, one needs to be funny in the funny moments and serious in the serious moments, cheer up! Everything will come to an end in a couple of days anyway, stand proud you are strong!”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Believe me, nothing that concerns you, in fact you should celebrate, in a little while you will think this was all a dream and I will finally leave you alone, and here I thought we were finally getting close, let me take a picture to capture the moment.”

“But why me?”

“Believe me darling, you were not my first choice, sadly I must ensure that they remain locked until the time is right, it’s the only way we can en- “

*A scream interrupts them, he always screams, the first time it happened I asked plainly if they were torturing him, but when they showed me a recording of John sleeping and violently thrashing and screaming I had no more doubts that something weird was going on, and so, at around the same time every day I have been tortured by the screams of a kid captive and in pain while I do nothing to stop them.*

*But this time it was different, I had enough of this annoying little interloper still wet behind the ears, with newfound confidence is then that I go to the door and grab the doorknob to put an end to my torment.*

“I’m done playing this games, I’m freeing them at once and if you really think that because you are some sort of stupid ghost that only I can see I will follow all of your orders and say nothing about it just because of some “great danger” and “immeasurable pain” then you are fucking wrong.”

*And even though I had the intention and will to get out of there and burst down the walls of the place if need be I could not move, no matter what, no matter what I did, not matter what I thought or how much I struggled,  it seemed like my very being was frozen in place, the world grew to a standstill, everything around me stopping in place by some unknown power, and so, it came down, and went through me, stopping at the other side of me, leaning in until I felt it be but a half inch away from touching my face with its, there is no word I feel that can truly described the sensation of the going through me, it felt wrong, it felt disgusting, it felt as if I the very concept of my existence had been violated to its core without regard, unnatural and humiliating for I could do nothing but watch. It is then that it whispered in my ear as breath left me in a sweet voice that hid potent venom behind the honeyed tone, like a sirens call, too perfect to be believed, too perfect to feasibly exist.*

“Yes, what other choice do you have anyways?”

*When the world unfroze I was where I was before I wanted to leave, effortlessly moved not only in location but in time as well, and I wanted to puke, but I didn’t then, I could not afford to show fear to the being, even though I knew deep down that I would never leave their palm.*

“Fine then, but it’s not fair, I need, no, I demand an explanation, a reason, as to the why, as to why is it so important for a kid to be locked up while it suffers, to deny freedom to a victim or justice to the girl that might not wake up next door, answer me dammit, why?”

*I tried to appeal to whatever reason this being had, and surprisingly it somehow worked, it hesitated for a moment, staring at the fake resolve burning in my eyes, and then it came down from where it was and sat atop a nearby box, I heard no creaking of the wood for it did not exert weight upon it, it was ethereal and shining through the only window, a crude small hole made in the top of the wall for ventilation, was the purest of moonlight, a sight that made it felt surreal a dream coted nightmare.*

“Very well then, I suppose you need to know, John… is dead.”

“What?... what do you mean by that?”

“The John you knew died that day at the shore, they have been replaced, by a monster, a monster that is slowly realizing this fact as well and its growing hungry.”

“A monster? that impossible I just saw them, I saw it in his eyes, it’s the very same kid that entered but a few years ago to study and follow their dream, I handed him the invitation myself because of his grades, there is no way he is dead! There is no way it’s not them!”

“Oh, but it is, for it already happened, and soon, that monster will fully awaken, free themselves from their chains and ravage as they have always done, which is why they must be stopped before it’s too late.”

“Can’t you just stop them? I’m sure you are more than powerful enough; you must be a god! Or something like that, what does it have to do me with me! what does it have to do with the kids!”

“Unfortunately this statement is false, I’m not a god and I’m certainly not strong enough to take on the thing that shall emerge, it is already very taxing just to pull myself together and remain in this corporeal form and it is due to the limitations of the causality that has yet to gather that this fate, I cannot alter any further.”

“God… I can’t believe this, just what is it that walks in their skin for you to speak of it like that?”

“An accursed being, A ruthless instrument of war, The weapon pointed at the very head of the world, The sharpest sword, The maximum expression of entropy taken form, Death made manifest, The one that did the unforgivable to prevent the unthinkable, The one who left it all behind, a monster tied not by the constrains of reality and the fabric where its woven, The existence that swallowed the sun, The flaw that the world dared not erase… and a friend, a friend that I should have treated better.”

*There was genuine sadness in those words, I could not feel any emotion from anything else he had said until this point, before I gathered courage by knowing that if everything was a game as long as I could keep it entertained I could just wait the storm out, that if I did everything it said then perhaps I would live to tell the tale, but now that speck of courage crumbled under the realization that depending on what I say I would be killed on the spot with but a thought of whatever it was that was in front of me.*

“I fail to understand, please… Explain.”

*And as if the world around me grew white in a flash, there was nothing and yet I knew that there was everything.*

“Nothing.

*The scene changed, with violence hideous forms come out of the nothing and consume the everything, things come into existence just to disappear in a flash, beings that I dare not look upon for even their presence, real or not, felt like it would consume me, consume not only my body but my mind as well, my sanity and my soul.*

Monsters.

*Suddenly, everything around me crumbled, what once was an ocean and a sky, bustling with activity and a creativity not seen before now was but as empty as it once was, the monster from before gone, their hideous incomprehensible existences devoured and left to rot in eternity*

Death.

*Acceleration, the bodies that once were still now moving, delaying into nothing in but a flash, their presences replaced with others equally as massive, equally as incomprehensible, and for the first time I felt it since coming into this space.*

Time.

*Suddenly, the energy, I felt it, the energy changed, it moved, it moved around, it danced, it was dead but it was equally alive, the stages now coming through in a flash compared to the ones before that lasted an eternity, or perhaps, was it this one that took an eternity and the first ones were but a moment, now the energy got together to create unimaginable things, wrong and perfect, good and bad until it all eventually had no side.*

Magic.

*And it is from this energy that a flash burst forth, was it natural, or was it created by some being I could not tell, my mind too small to comprehend the events unfolding, if before there was nothing now there was everything, the space changing into colorful hues, stars like little specks in the sky and little colorful orbs filling the new fabric to the brim.*

Reality.

*And just like that, everything became pure white once more*

This is the order in which all that is was created, from the nothings burst forth monsters, the monsters devoured each other and from the clash of their domains and their sudden deaths the all could handle it no longer and so it created time to lessen the charge, with these new limitations in place everything was radically changed even if the ones that came before this change could ignore its effects, from this change and residual energy of the war in heaven mana came into being and then magic, it is with this magic and authority from the strongest of existences that reality became a thing, initially isolated worlds sharing the most basics of blocks, a quickly evolving construct that became one with the system of the all, becoming inseparable, to destroy one would mean destroying the other, with this in place, it all became a united web, a development facilitated by lesser inferior beings created either by the superior existence that made the world or created by the natural gathering of causality.

To understand the one we are up against we need to go back to where monsters first appeared, many think of reality and the all but as mere places that came into existence, the truth is that they are so complex comparing them to a living being barely does it justice, the creations that first surged forth were all perfect, becoming monsters that would shape the world, this did not account for what would happen later, for when the first blocks did their purpose and returned to everything there was it did not account for the causality accumulated in the in-between, a system that quickly became clogged, to alleviate the pressure time was created, when this happen new the space that once existed as one became segmented, branching and yet it remained together, the existences that came forth once this happen were supposed to be perfect but because of the impurities accumulated  by the first batch some could not live up to the standard.",1,1739764843.0,u_the-elemelon,0,1.0,False
1irb2rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1irb2rr/aita_for_leaving_my_lease_early_and_taking_shared/,AITA For leaving my lease early and taking shared items,"Me and two other girls, let’s say Mary (25) and Kate (24) have lived together for almost two years now. We agreed to individually buy items for the house to share (ie. kitchen stuff) and larger items we would split (couch). We split the rent 800/700/600, me paying 800 for the master.

About seven months ago I started staying with my fiancé almost full time. The only time I would be at my house was to sleep twice a week during the day after a 13 hour night shift. We wanted to wait until marriage to move in, but Kate’s boyfriend moved into our place without consulting Mary and I first. I was trying to be understanding of it since she was my friend, but it made me uncomfortable. I brought it up to Kate & nothing came of it. I brushed it off and even offered for them to take the master.

I have not cooked, slept a night, or watched TV there in months. Still paying 800 and 1/3 of utilities. 

In January, my fiancé and I decided to say F it and move me in. I was tired of my stuff getting ruined & not having my it with me. I let Mary and Kate know that I was going to be fully moving out in 2 weeks. I said I was going to keep paying rent and utilities til our lease is up in March. I offered to Kate if they wanted to keep my coffee table for free, she said no, I said im going to sell it. I said they can just keep whatever items we split & they don’t need to pay me back.

February 13th, I move my stuff out. There were more than enough of certain items that it didn’t make a difference for them that I took mine. However, when I took my pots/pans, I got a cheap set to replace it with. For the trash can, I replaced it with a can my fiancé and I had been using for the past 7 months. I listed my coffee table and barstools for sale.

That night I get an angry text from Mary & Kate about the trashcan and pots I left for them. I offered to throw it away for them. They reluctantly said they’d keep it because “what else are they supposed to do” so I apologized, and reiterated that I said I was moving out. One month early.

The next day, I had offers for both the barstools and coffee table. My fiancé and I went back to deep clean my personal space, and hand over the items to the buyers. Mary & Kate got home when we were loading up them up. It became heated. 

Mary and Kate were pissed that I had sold the table. That I had taken my “stainless steel” trashcan and “left them with a shitty one.” That I had let them use my items for 7 months, its selfish that I didn’t just wait 1 more. Called inconsiderate, disrespectful, and you can picture more vulgar words in the mix.They apparently thought when I said I was fully moving out, that it meant only my bed and clothes. Despite conversations we had weeks prior regarding me offering them things and stating I would sell it.

I got fed up, grabbed the trashcan/pots, drove off, and tossed them.

Am I the asshole for taking my personal items when I left? Or should I have just waited one more month? ",1,1739764836.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I just moved to DC after spending 7 years across Europe (Stockholm, Paris, and Berlin) - I'm originally from Kenya, and I certainly picked an interesting time to arrive here. Coming from a continent that's had its fair share of bad leadership and seen the negative impacts of poor policies, I deeply understand what many of you are going through right now.   
  
As an entrepreneur focused on financial inclusion and impact, I started with very little when I first moved to Paris. The first one year was all about ramen noodles and terrible vending machine coffee, but I made it work. During my time in Europe, I met many Americans who arrived in Berlin and Paris with minimal savings and no concrete plans, yet managed to build meaningful lives there.(You have similar social benefits as a citizen on the first day of arrival as a resident)  
  
That said, I wouldn't recommend anyone from any of these places (including Kenya) to move to America without substantial savings and a solid plan - it's incredibly expensive here!   
  
To those who've lost their jobs and are feeling in limbo: I'd be happy to grab coffee or jump on a call to share honest insights about:   
\- What it's really like relocating to Kenya, France, or Germany(I have friends moving from this places as cizitizens to Lisbon as a 4th option)   
\- Starting a business abroad or generally  
\- Living costs and practical considerations   
\- The opportunities and challenges in each place   
  
I'm also launching a fintech platform (think better version of Kiva) focused on SME financing in Africa. For those with experience in financial inclusion or SME development, I'd be interested in exploring advisory opportunities. This could include visiting our team in Kenya - we have a beautiful space there and would cover travel and accommodation for the right fit.   
  
Being new here without local friends or family, I have plenty of time for social connections and would genuinely like to share my experience with anyone who might find it helpful.",0,1739764691.0,washingtondc,0,0.33,False

They were at a quiet café, a place they frequented. She sipped her coffee, watching him across the small table. He was always so eager to please, so quick to anticipate her needs. She appreciated it, of course, but there was something delicious about making him squirm.

Leaning forward, she lowered her voice just enough for only him to hear.

“You’re not allowed to cross your legs,” she murmured, a knowing smirk playing at her lips.

He hesitated for half a second, then obeyed, shifting slightly in his chair. She watched his muscles tense, his attempt at casual composure.

She let a moment pass, then reached for a sugar packet, her fingers brushing his wrist as if by accident. His breath hitched just a little. Oh, this would be fun.

“You’re doing well,” she praised softly. “But I wonder… can you keep your hands on the table? No fidgeting.”

His fingers flexed, then settled flat on the wooden surface. She could see the effort it took, the way his body begged to shift, to move. The tiny flicker of frustration in his eyes sent a thrill through her.

She took her time finishing her drink, keeping the conversation light, her amusement hidden beneath the surface. When she finally stood, she leaned just close enough for him to feel the warmth of her breath.

“Good boy.”

2. Coffee Prices are skyrocketing, the impact is already be felt, but will hit even harder in the coming months.

We really did not know each other that much, but we started to grow closer after a trip we had with mutual friends to the beach that served to introduce us to one another. Out of sheer luck we both entered the same University and ended up in the same class, and since we both were awkward introverts back then we became really close friends in a matter of weeks. It was amazing, we had so much chemistry together: You know how it feels to hang out with someone who just happens to be in your “right wavelength”? That was how it was for us. We became inseparable for a few months, but turns out she was going to quit university to go abroad and complete her studies there. I remember the day she left: I had a really important exam and I nearly threw it away to go and say goodbye to her in the airport. It was actually raining and everything, I know, very dramatic. But she was so happy to see me there.

When she left, even though I never showed it, I was left in shambles, since no one had had such a deep impact in my life in such a short time till she arrived. Turns out, she was feeling the same. Things didn’t work out for her abroad, and she decided to come back to our home country. Also, she realized something: She really liked me. And not just as a friend. Sadly, things didn’t go as planned. She was very shy and reserved, so naturally she didn’t try to tell me this. Thus, I only saw her as a friend. After a while, I also started to grow feelings towards her, but by then, her mental health situation had deteriorated a lot due to various circumstances, and she was tired of the “situationship” we sort of had.

We spent months fighting and making up, trying to make sense of our friendship. We created this horrible routine of finding every day new ways to hurt each other, and despite that, we still cared deeply about one another in some sick way. We were both really immature back then. It all came crashing down when we went, with the same mutual friends I mentioned way back, to the same beach we met each other. I sent her a couple of texts before the trip that upset her (and they were some really dumb texts: Me basically telling her how much I cared about her and how I still liked her, you know, those dumb 4am texts you totally shouldn’t send ANYONE) and the whole trip became a sort of cold war between us. Once more, we both acted in really immature ways. On the last day of the trip I attempted to approach her, to ask her if we could talk about everything that has happened. She stormed off. I tried to chase her, and I remember that I tried to grab her arm as she was trying to get away. She shrugged me off, headed for the car some of my friends were leaving in and left. The memory of me chasing her, trying to grab her, is still one of the most shameful memories I have.

Time passed, at first we didn’t speak to each other but we were both deeply affected by this whole fight. In a way, we were trying to rebuild our lives without one another. Both of us at some point tried to reach out, to no avail. Neither of us really wanted to open those wounds again. Years passed, both of us graduated from University and we both seem to have bright futures. I have a loving girlfriend, a tight group of friends and a supportive family. She lives on her own now, has a loving boyfriend and has managed to overcome her mental health issues as some friends tell me. She is happy now. And that actually makes me happy.

But for some reason, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her, not a single day, for the past 6 years:

Each time I go to sleep I think about her. About how I hurt her. About “what if’s”. I keep wondering if one say we’ll meet each other again, somewhere. On the street maybe, on a coffee shop, a party, anywhere. Some days I think that I’d just look at her and think “Oh, look, thats E. hadn’t seen her in a while” and then walk away. Other days I fantasize that we’d sit down and talk about anything like we used to. I know it won’t happen, I know it’s compulsive and I know it’s not healthy. I think a part of me just wants to get to say I’m sorry, but at the same time I know it doesn’t even matter anymore, this whole fight was so long ago and we are totally different people now.

But I swear that I haven’t been able to rest a single day thinking about how I ruined this friendship with one of the persons I cared the most for in this world.

And as much as I try to accept it. I haven’t been able to, in six years. Every. Single. Day. Back then, therapy didn’t help. She feels like a ghost that follows me everywhere. A reminder of the failures of my past. Of how I was capable of hurting someone I loved. And of how I was hurt.

And truthfully, I just want to be able to forgive myself and move on.",2,1739764443.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Hoshino Seicha-en is the brand she mostly promotes I think since they are her supplier when she does popups.

I purchased the Mokuren on her recommendation as a way to more mindfully use ceremonial grade matcha but also get my daily lattes without compromising on quality. Mokuren is sold in 100g packs and is described to be for culinary purposes but can still be used for tea ceremony practice.

**My first impression** for this matcha is how frothy it is; it seems to froth easier than other matchas I've tried. I suspect it's easier to get a microfoam out of this one.

**Taste-wise as an usucha** I notice that it's a bit more astringent and not as creamy. Which is fine because this is latte grade!

**Taste of it as a latte? Oh boy.** You can give me this one and a ceremonial grade and I won't be able to tell the difference. It held up well under two preparations I've tried:

* Non-fat dairy milk, 100ml; traditionally prepared 4g with 50-70ml of <80˚C hot water
* Oatside oat milk, 150ml; traditionally prepared 4g with 70ml of <80˚C hot water

The matcha is still strong, it's still rich and maintains the umami the brand is well-known for (as a Yame-based matcha).

**In terms of caffeine,** this would be perfect for those who are still weaning from coffee as their caffeine source as ***this is strong***. I can't recall the last time I've had a powder that gave me a bit of palpitation under 5 grams. If you wanna wake up with your matcha latte, use this.

**Initial smell and taste notes?** It's still strong on the umami since Hoshino Seicha-en is known for it, some of their ceremonial powders have seaweed notes in it; though I didn't taste the seaweed, the umami is definitely there.

It's the same price as a tin can of their 30-40g ceremonial grade matcha but at more than 2x the amount so this will be a good alternative as we ride out the matcha shortage.",1,1739764290.0,MatchaEverything,0,1.0,False

- Reservations aren’t that difficult if you plan 2+ weeks in advance or if you don’t mind later seating times, but if you want a specific date I would book earlier than later.
- Credit card is required to get the reservation, but it’s not pre-paid. You’ll pay once the meal is done.
- Did the Kitchen Counter experience ($285/pp) along with wine pairing ($135/pp)
    - 9 courses (11 if you include canapé and petit fours)
    - Service charge isn’t included in the bill. You’ll be given an option when you pay to select the tip amount.
- Solo-reservations are available, just less common than 2+ person reservations.
    - I think solo-diners can only do the more expensive Kitchen Counter experience

Notes on the restaurant:
- Easy to find from the outside.
- Elevator is a bit old and slow, it feels a bit out of place for a fine-dining establishment.
- Blind tasting, menu is provided after the meal.
    - Menu comes tri-folded in a small envelope. It was a bit annoying as I want to eventually frame the menus & souvenirs from fine-dining restaurants I’ve been to.
- Ample spaces between tables and the chairs looked comfortable.
- Counter seating area is well lit, main dining room is a bit dimmer.
- Counter seating area is loud due to close-proximity to the kitchen, coupled with the loud music it’s hard to hear the FOH
    - Would recommend table seating in the dining room if you want something quieter
- Good bathroom.
    - Clean
    - Toilet paper is nice (I believe it’s Charmin Ultra Soft)
    - Le Labo soap
    - Hand towels to dry your hands afterwards

Notes on the food:
- Very clear French and Japanese influences in their dishes
- Rice & wagyu dish was phenomenal, probably the best dish I’ve had in Canada so far
- Lobster dish was much better than expected. The differences in texture (crispy Brussels sprouts, crunchy cauliflower, lobster) was the highlight of the dish. Spice from the green curry sauce helped balance the dish so it didn’t feel so rich.
- Palate cleanser was very nice after some heavy dishes
- Cold vanilla ice cream in the dessert acted as another palate cleanser which I enjoyed.
- Wine pairing was great (7 glasses, 2oz each). It was the first time I’ve been paired white wine with beef but it was a pleasant surprise.
- Tea (and I assume coffee) during petit fours isn’t complementary - a bit annoying.

Notes on service:
- Great pacing on food & wine pairing (Just under 3hrs for canapé to petit fours)
- Good attention to detail - counter was always clean.
- Sommelier was great. Easy to talk to, laid-back, yet professional service. Always seemed like she poured more than 2oz/drink which is always nice.
- 6” offset plating tweezer was a bit of a weird cutlery choice for the sashimi dishes at the start. It’s cool in a way that you’re using the same tool as the kitchen, but in terms of comfort a fork and/or chopsticks would’ve been a better choice imo.

TL;DR:
- Great good, great service. If you like being pampered you’ll enjoy the experience.",11,1739764038.0,FoodToronto,7,1.0,False

1irarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1irarky/did_i_do_the_right_thing/,Did I do the right thing?,"So there’s a cat that hangs out on my porch. It started about a month ago. It snowed about the second week in January and she showed up right about that time. I’ve seen her at the neighbors before but she’s always outside on their driveway. There’s also a large colony of feral cats that roams my neighborhood as well. She had a purple collar with a bell on when she showed up but one day I came out on the porch and she didn’t have the collar anymore. 

I say all this to explain that I’m not sure if she’s part of the colony, the neighbors cat or a cat dropped off by the road who made her way to my house (I live by the road but in a neighborhood. The main road is about a mile from my house) but either way she has been living on my porch for a little over a month now. 

At first I tried to take her to the neighbors and would shoo her away and tell her to go home but she would always come back. Then the last week of January I didn’t see her one day. It was about 2 days and I saw no sign of her. I thought maybe she had moved on or the neighbors noticed her wondering and took her inside. I was glad because I thought they’d finally given a shit about their cat. 

But then the next day there she was sitting on my porch. And she was pregnant. She wasn’t just fat she was visibly “with child” and ever since then she has been sitting on my porch. I started setting out water for her and made her a little hut to sleep in. She never ventures far from my porch. She either comes running around the house when I get home or pops up the steps from under the porch when I open the door. 

The neighbors are always out on their driveway coming home or leaving or just standing around talking so I KNOW they’ve seen her on my porch. But no one from there has ever said a thing or called over to me to tell me she’s their cat, and they’ve never come over to let me know she’s theirs. They’ve even seen me out on the porch with her and never said a word. They have tons of animals at their house too. They’re close enough that they could yell over and say something but they never do. 

So fast forward to tonight and it’s supposed to flurry. Nothing major but it’s been pretty cold all day. I decided since there’s no telling when she’ll have her babies and since it was going to be pretty cold that I would let her in. So I opened the screen door and let her poke her head in and she took a minute but she came in the door and explored my living room and kitchen. She scratched the side of the couch and sniffed the coffee table. I managed to herd her to the room where I had made a bed and laid down training pads for her to use and I sat in there with her for a while and gave her scratches and rubbed her belly. I even held the front door open for her to see if she wanted to leave but she just meowed at me. I gave her every chance to leave but she declined. So I shut her “bedroom door” and went to bed. I have 3 other cats and since I don’t know anything for certain about her I thought it was safest to keep her separated from my cats until I figure out the next steps. Just to cover my ass so they don’t fight her or hurt her or catch something she might possibly have. 

When I let her in my porch light was off and the neighbors lights were all off. Their porch was dark and no one was outside. But I’m still laying here unable to sleep because I’m worried that somehow she is their cat and they won’t see her on my porch in the morning and know something is up. I keep telling myself I did the right thing instead of leaving her pregnant and out in the cold but I’m worried. I don’t want to get in trouble or start a fight with my neighbors but they also don’t seem to care IF it is their cat.

I froze, the remote slipping from my hand. For a moment, I thought it was the wind, but the sound came again. Slow. Deliberate.  

Curiosity got the better of me, and I crept toward the door. The porch light flickered, casting pale light on the rain-soaked deck.  

And then I saw it.  

The cat.  

It stood upright, its paws pressed against the glass, staring in. Black-and-white fur slicked down its body, and its green eyes seemed to glow, almost unnaturally bright in the dim light.  

Something about it wasn’t right. It didn’t move. It didn’t blink. Its head tilted slightly, as if studying me.  

I stepped closer, my breath fogging the glass. “Where did you come from?” I murmured.  

The cat’s paw slid down the glass with a faint squeak, leaving a trail of misty condensation behind. Its head tilted further, almost as though it understood me.  

I reached for the door handle, hesitating. The cat shifted, just enough to stop me. My heart raced as I let my hand fall.  

The storm raged on, but the cat didn’t flinch. I backed away from the door and sat on the couch, pretending to ignore it. When I glanced over my shoulder minutes later, it was still there, staring.  

The next morning, I woke to find it in the same spot. The rain had stopped, but the cat hadn’t moved. Its green eyes followed me as I made my coffee, as if it had been waiting all night.  

I tried shooing it away, knocking on the glass, but it only stared, unmoving. I considered opening the door, but something deep in my gut told me not to.  

Now, every time I approach the door, it’s there. Its eyes glow faintly, like it sees something I don’t. I can’t explain why, but I feel like I’m being watched constantly, even when I’m nowhere near the door.  

I’ve discovered one thing, though: if I toss a handful of treats onto the porch, it will leave long enough for me to step outside. But it always comes back, waiting, watching.  

And I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not the cat that’s trapped here. It’s me.

He began shouting and swearing at me for rolling the stop sign near the corner.

While he was shouting I mocked him and drove away to get my coffee a few blocks away. On my return he was still outside in his driveway and approached me as I stopped fully this time headed home. He approached mt car and my windows were half down. He began swearing and yelling once again, and I smiled and mocked him again, this infuriated him and he tried to punch me 3x through the window but couldn’t reach do to the window being half down not fully down. This made him more angry so he came to the driver side, as he came I rolled up those windows. He smacked the window with his hand hard. But it was up, so then he grabbed my door handle to get into the driver door. Thankfully it was locked because my car auto locks in drive. I no longer thought this was just an angry drunk, and now began to fear he’s going to damage me or my car, so on his way back in front of the car toward his house and the still open passenger windows, he slammed his fist on my hood hard.. I decided screw this. It’s time to go. I took my foot off the brake and (engine restarted, it’s auto turn off at complete stops). When the engine started he stopped heading to his house and stepped back in front of my passenger headlight and almost threw himself on the hood sort of. I pushed the gas and he tumbled off the hood/fender next to the passenger front wheel. I drove off. 

I went home and switched on my security cameras in case he decided to come to my house and called my wife to explain what happened. Two days went by and then police came over knocking. They asked if I was involved in a hit and run and I said I don’t kno what you’re talking about. They asked how I had dents on my car I said we have lots of dings and dents. You’ll have to speak to my attorney. I’m not speaking to police until I have one. 

4 months later I’m charged with:

1. felony assault with a deadly weapon. 
2. felony leaving the scene of an accident resulting in injury or death
3. felony falsification of a vehicle license plate (my plate was expired so I had my bmw plate on it until my bmw was fixed and the edge was being traded in afterwards.

I contacted 3 lawyers and the police and all told me I can not file a counter assault charge.. that’s bullshit given the circumstances. 

Fast forward to the discovery hearing, the dude straight testifies to trying to assault me. He’s who told them about trying to punch me 3x.

Never mentioned in the police report and matter of fact, the day of he said someone clubbed him with a lead pipe. Police made no mention of that in their statement. 

So police get a text from the guys sister and went two days later after the dudes sister visits him in the hospital for head injury and now all the sudden he remembers being hit by a big black dodge ram truck… I drive a ford edge.

This is all testimony from the guy himself. Police also again leave out of the report about him coming to the driver side or trying to punch me on the passenger side 3x first (none of that was in the police report. Not mentioned until he was on the stand at Discovery.

To top it off, there was a witness at the stop sign across from us… and that Only witness says she seen him jump on my hood and I did not strike him with my car. Again, completely ignored by prosecutors and police. I didn’t think they would dream of charging me with all this evidence to the contrary.

So why the hell can’t I file a counter assault suit and get this crap dropped? It’s ruining my family, I’m stressed out to the max, I’ve got two young girls I care for and work from home while my wife is an RN in the ICU. I keep having to go to all these court dates and not one person besides my attorney has even heard my statement. 

This can’t be how this works??
Please advise. I’m a little scared to be putting my family’s future and potentially becoming a felon on BS charges from over zealous cops and dude looking for an insurance fraud payout after being advised by his sister to do so.

Thanks in advance for any assistance!

1irakte,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1irakte/dont_do_these_13_things_in_paris_from_a_local_to/,"DON'T do these 13 things in Paris. From a local, to you.","1. Don’t stop in the middle of the sidewalk

Unfortunately, it’s a fairly common practice that can get on the nerves of Parisians, who, it has to be said, sometimes don’t need much to get on their nerves. Don’t stop in the middle of the sidewalk; instead, stand to one side to consult your map or take your photos. This way, you won’t be pushed around by people in a hurry or on their way to work, and you won’t get in anyone’s way.

2) Don’t stand in the middle of escalators

If you don’t want to be jostled on the escalators, keep to the right. People in a hurry go to the left. The principle is simple and universal. It’s the key to avoiding blocking and irritating everyone, especially at rush hour.

3) Don’t go to big chains

There are so many small establishments with exceptional products and top-notch service that it would be a shame to end up at McDonald’s or Starbucks.

Choose local restaurants and cafés for an authentic Parisian experience.

A baguette and croissant from a good artisan bakery, accompanied by a refined café on the terrace, is much better than an overpriced, over-sweetened coffee, don’t you think? Plus, you’re supporting the local economy!

4) Don’t miss out on learning a few French words

Even though many Parisians speak English more or less well, making the effort to learn a few words in French can greatly enhance your experience.

A simple “bonjour”, “merci” or “s’il vous plaît” is always appreciated and shows that you respect the local culture. Speak even more simple phrases and you will be delighted by how different and more immersive your visit will be.

 5) Don’t just visit the major monuments

The Canal Saint-Martin is little known to tourists but is a very charming place, ideal for waterside strolls. I’m not saying you shouldn’t visit the Louvre, or even climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but there’s so much more to visit in Paris! Discover lesser-known neighborhoods like the Marais, visit fascinating sites like the Sainte-Chapelle and explore the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin, for example. Ask your concierge for a few examples or ask locals you are interacting with already.

6) Avoid shopping on the Champs-Élysées

It’s not here that you’ll find the gem you’re looking for. The Champs-Élysées are certainly iconic, but they are often crowded and feature only large chain stores that aren’t particularly inexpensive. For a more unique shopping experience, I recommend heading to Saint-Germain-des-Prés or the Marais, where you’ll find independent boutiques with more singular and unique items. Or, look up thrift stores!

7) Avoid overloading your schedule

It can be tempting to want to plan everything so as to visit as many places as possible, but this can backfire and become exhausting! These schedules are often difficult to keep, because they don’t take enough time into account for walking and transport. Feeling rushed in Paris is the EXACT opposite of how we want you to feel.

8) Don’t visit Paris in August

In August, most Parisians are on vacation. So what’s the problem? Well, it also means that many shops and restaurants will be closed at this time in the less touristy areas. On top of that, it’s the busiest time of the year for tourists, so you’ll spend your stay waiting in line at every monument.I’d advise you to come in May, June, September and October.

9) Don’t neglect safety

As in all big cities, you need to beware of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas like the metro. Always keep an eye on your belongings and wear tight pants—they won’t pick your pocket like that!

,10) Avoid places that are too popular on Instagram or TikTok

Is that queue in front of the Angelina Rivoli really worth it? Some places, like the Angelina tearoom, are ultra-popular on social networks and sometimes don’t live up to their reputation after sometimes an hour in line. Instead, look for lesser-known places with authentic charm that will have just as great of a photo opportunity and then YOU will look like a seasoned visitor.

11) Take time to eat

French culture places great importance on leisurely meals. Don’t rush to eat, and take the time to savor each dish. You’ll appreciate French cuisine and the local art of living even more.

12) Don’t limit yourself to tourist restaurants

Restaurants near tourist attractions are often far too expensive for what they offer. Ask locals or your hotel for recommendations to discover establishments that are popular with locals and unknown to other tourists. Ask the waitstaff at each place you eat, where THEY eat! If you're in a pharmacy, ask where they eat for lunch. Locals really do love to share and help.

13) Don’t miss an evening stroll

Paris at night is one of the most underrated aspects of your visit. Strolling around Paris is a magnificent experience, and it is even more so at night! You’ll be able to explore a whole new side of Paris, with its romantic atmosphere, illuminated monuments, and glittering Eiffel Tower. I honestly prefer the city at night, as do most. So, one day, take a nap during the day and take a long walk a night and you will be amazed at how differently you will see the city.",81,1739763169.0,ParisTravelGuide,20,0.98,False

I've been reading and watching how to do it.. And... I'm confused by a few things that people swear by being one way but others say otherwise.

1. Adding stuff to the henna paste. I see lots of posts saying adding lemon juice will make it lighter or brighter, I've seen ones that say lemon juice is drying to the hair and to use chamomile tea, and I've ones that say use green tea, coffee, or just hot distilled water(is the distilled part  that important?).

What should I add?

2. Leaving to sit. This is also all over the place on what I see out there. Some say leave it out for a day, some say leave it in the fridge overnight, some say leave it out for a few hours, and some say use it right away while it still warm and try to keep it warm while applying to the hair.

Does it really need to be left to sit?

3. How long to leave it in the hair. I've seen a range of 2 hours to as long as you can. With a lot of stress being longer is better.

What is the optimal length of time to have the henna in the hair?  
  
4. Lastly, Is it permanent? I see equal posts stated that it is and isn't. I've only ever use semi permanent dye and don't really think it's worth the trouble.  


Bonus question: I saw one video saying that you can't use metal for mixing, applying, and clipping hair. No explanation was giving for why henna doesn't like metal so I'm skeptical. Does anyone know if that's true and what happens if metal and henna touch?

I love to hear peoples experiences with henna. My hair doesn't show red like it used to and I'm excited to give it a major boost. ",0,1739763140.0,henna,3,0.5,False

🚀 The world does not see them. Or if it does, it sees them wrong.
🚀 They are told that their worth is their desirability.
🚀 They are told that their power is their compliance.
🚀 They are told that their deep, world-shaping emotions are “too much.”

🔥 And it is killing them.

🚨 We do not need another vague call for “self-care” or another hollow affirmation of “you are loved” from the same world that makes them feel utterly alone.
🚨 We need to build real belonging, real communion, real sites of resonance where they do not just survive but come alive.

And we already know how to do it.
Because they have already started building it themselves.

1️⃣ The Virtual Nations of Adolescent AFAB People: The Hidden Empires of the Future

🌟 Swiftie Culture – The decentralized, emotionally intelligent, symbol-rich web of emotional espionage, shared codes, and unspoken understanding.
🌟 K-pop Standom – The infrastructure of belonging, of shared purpose, of high-energy obsession as an organizing principle.
🌟 Tumblr, Discord, Fanfiction Worlds – The great psychic republics of teenage intensity, where love is currency and longing is law.

🔥 These are not just “fandoms.” These are already existing psychic nations.
🔥 These are spaces of emotional attunement, of aesthetic sovereignty, of creative expression outside of patriarchal surveillance.
🔥 And yet—even here—too many feel lost, unseen, excluded, or isolated within their own refuge.

🚨 We are not here to replace these spaces—we are here to upgrade them, to augment them, to reinforce their foundations.
🚨 We are here to make sure that no one in these nations has to feel alone again.

2️⃣ Pornotopia & CS-SIER-OA: The Superengineered Psychic Belonging They Deserve

🚀 The Core Message: You Are Not Valuable for Your Body. You Are Valuable for Your Sensitivity, Your Insight, Your World-Building Power.
🚀 You were never here to be someone else’s fantasy. You were never here to be digestible, palatable, or acceptable.
🚀 You are here because you are the world’s future architects of feeling, its protectors of the invisible, its defenders of the sacred.

🔥 You were never just meant to reproduce bodies. You were meant to reproduce meaning, connection, possibility.
🔥 You were never just meant to be seen. You were meant to arrange the world so that what matters is seen.
🔥 And you are already doing it—through the friendships you build, the stories you write, the aesthetics you construct, the communities you cultivate.

🚨 It is Mitleid—it is communion—it is the recognition that your suffering is not yours alone.
🚨 Every time you have made a friend feel understood, you have already done what this world’s so-called leaders fail to do.
🚨 Every time you have created beauty in defiance of despair, you have already fought the hardest battle.

3️⃣ Superengineering the Sites of Psychic Belonging: What We Must Build

🔥 1️⃣ Micro-Sanctuaries: Small-Scale Emotional Safehouses in Online & Physical Spaces
✔ Virtual Spaces – Private Discord servers, hidden Tumblr networks, low-visibility group chats that act as real support structures.
✔ Physical Spaces – Libraries, parks, coffee shops, any public space that can be transformed into a place of quiet belonging.

🚨 These are spaces where the rules are inverted: where intensity is valued, where care is power, where no one is ever “too much.”

🔥 2️⃣ Aesthetics of Strength-Through-Vulnerability
✔ Make the invisible visible—normalize extreme emotion, deep longing, sacred over-attachment.
✔ Reclaim the idea that femininity (in all forms) is a form of tactical intelligence, not a liability.
✔ Show that softness is not weakness—softness is control over the atmosphere, attunement to detail, mastery of mood.

🚨 We are not just saying they are powerful—we are creating new ways for them to feel it, see it, and wield it.

🔥 3️⃣ Psychic Insurgency: Fighting the Lies at the Root
✔ Countering the internalized belief that their sensitivity makes them a burden.
✔ Dismantling the equation of their worth with their desirability.
✔ Replacing survival-based masking with deliberate, chosen performance—acting as an art, not a necessity.

🚨 If they know they are not alone, if they know that their struggles are not unique failures but shared experiences, they will have the strength to continue.

4️⃣ The Ritual of Recognition: Ensuring That No One Slips Through the Cracks

🔥 We need a way for every adolescent AFAB person in crisis to receive an unmistakable signal that they are part of something real.
🔥 A marker, a sign, a phrase, an object that instantly communicates: “You are not alone.”

🚨 Candidate Signals:
✔ A physical token: Something orange—a ribbon, a stone, a charm that can be carried, given, or left behind as a sign of belonging.
✔ A coded phrase: Something simple but unmistakable, something that when said, responded to, or found in the world lets them know: You are seen. You are one of us.
✔ A shared gesture: A way of signaling in public without fear—a way of finding each other in the open world.

🚨 Every one of them must know that they are not invisible. That there are others like them, waiting, reaching, holding space.

🔥 Because this is not just about survival. This is about making life worth surviving for.
🔥 This is about ensuring that no one who has the power to shape the future is lost to a present that refuses to see them.
🔥 This is about ensuring that no one suffers in silence when they were born to be part of a communion.

🚨 Final Call: The Backbone Era Starts Here. The End of Isolation. The Beginning of Recognition.

🔥 Now the question remains—what is the first step? What is the first action we take to ensure that they receive this message in time?",1,1739763088.0,GrimesAE,0,1.0,False

This 2nd company's suggestion is to add 14 panels and another 10kw battery array for $114/mo.

Now, **if** that wipes out my electric bill, it's totally a wash and at the very basic level it's simply that instead of giving one company the $100, we're giving it to another. But since I've already gone down the ""and the electric company will be paying YOU"" route that turned out to be incorrect, I'm skeptical.

Now aside from the money, I'm reflecting back on the 7 day outage we had this past July... We were pretty well off, having everything except HVAC, stove, and hot water, but after day 2, I had to fire up a generator to get a portable AC going. (and one morning I did crash the system by making coffee before the sun came up.) My thought is with this extra 10kw, we could run the portable ac, maybe two (but that might be pushing it).

You told me that I could date other person lalo na if hindi ko nakukuha sayo yung kailangan ko. 

Ano nga bang need ko? Time yun lang naman eh. 

So during our “break” I did go out on dates. 

He’s the third “John” di na nadala lol. It didn’t work out kasi mas emotional pa siya sakin? Coming from you na nonchalant? Hahaha. I feel overwhelmed. So, I called it off. Recently he texted me asking for another chance. 

Then I met “F”. Hindi pa siya forrest pero green flag. Men pag sinabi niyang 11:30 nandiyan na ako. 11:29 magte-text na siya ng picture na nandun na siya. Na stress nga ako kasi nale-late ako. Di ako sanay. Hahahaha. Yabang ko pa sabi ko I’ll wait for 20 mins lang ha. He’s like “What do you mean? I’m here na.” Sabay send ng picture. I waited for you for over an hour. Na never ko ginawa sa ibang naka date ko. 

He insists on picking me up sa bahay and dropping me off. Hindi pwede kako. Ayoko malaman ng kids pa. He drove from Cavite to BGC to Cavite just to make sure na safe ako makakauwi. Kasi galing akong inuman. 
Wala kaming plans na nacancel, HF. 

And he always calls me pag feeling niya off yung mga replies ko. But one time as in sleepy lang talaga ako. He called kasi around 9pm he asked  if I’d like to go grab some iced coffee. He called to make sure that I’m saying no kasi antok ako talaga at di nagtatampo. See how he’s worried about how I feel? Na sayo deadma madalas? You don’t call. Ilang beses lang the entire year. 

He doesn’t care about double texting. Hindi ako nakapag reply kasi super busy talaga. Non stop meetings. Ang sabi niya “I think you’ll be busy all night. Just text me when you can. I’ll go to sleep na. Good night.” Ikaw pag di ako nakapag reply wala na. Kahit ilang oras pa yan. And nag go-good night siya. Na dati ginagawa mo pero idk. Nawala. Pati good morning.

HE REALLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH I WANTED HIM SO I SAID IT! 

And then he never planned to meet me. I confronted him about this. Then he said it was because he was leaving the country in a couple of days and thought this intimacy will hurt me or HIM?! Which I don’t understand. But yea I still can’t stop thinking about him. I even texted him now. And he responds like almost a day later. I don’t know why I can’t hold my emotions.

I just want to spoil my taste buds and get out of my comfort zone. 

I’m willing to travel anywhere in S.F to find it. I’ll be adding the recommendations to my G-maps list. 

We live an incredible city and yet I stick to the same food spots all the time despite living here 10 years. 

Some of my favorites recently: Pastries at Third Wheel Coffee, burgers at the Hamburger Project, mexican hot chocolate at Regalito.

She told me that when she was married, she had a fling with a high school classmate (44M) but they did not have sex. Her husband found out, there was drama, but she and her husband worked it out but divorced some time later for other reasons.

Fast forward a few more years to a time when we are dating, and she and her HS classmate run into each other at their respective kids’ sporting events. He gets back in touch with her via FB, where he is very flirty and she is with him, but less so. She shares occasional screenshots with me, and it makes me
Uncomfortable because of their history (he was married and still is). A few months after they are back in touch, I was traveling for work and they were communicating via FB late at night and she’d mentioned that she was upset. He offered to come over while her kids and I were away “to just hold her”. She declined, but he offered a rain check and said “hold me to that” and she said “I will” (she shared these screenshots with me; I’m not a snooper). 

I told her I was not ok with that given their history, the fact that we are together, and the fact that he is married to someone else. She insisted that they were just friends and she’d like to remain friends with him. I said that friends is fine, but he doesn’t want friendship. I am not and don’t want to appear controlling, but this makes me insecure. She responded that she would just stop sharing their conversations with me.

Finally, a month ago, they made plans to get coffee and followed through. She didn’t tell me about this until two days after the fact. I would have been ok (probably foolishly) if she told me beforehand (or maybe less upset), but this REALLY rattled me. We had been supposed to go away together, and I told her I thought it would be best if I went away by myself because I needed time to think and I didn’t want to become angry with her over this and ruin the trip. She responded that she would never get over this trauma and betrayal and still brings it up, and I softly remind her of what led to my decision.

1iracjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1iracjz/fuck_sobriety/,fuck sobriety,"so i'll start with i had my phone taken off me for a few days because i keep buying pills online, and my social worker wants me to be sober. i'm addicted completely to opioids and valium. i'm not hateful towards myself for who i've become, i'm passed caring if i steal things, or make others hate me just so i can be high. i truly don't care. i just don't want to be sober, and i hate the fact everyone is crowding around me demanding something i don't want. 

i lost my dad last year and then i tried to kill myself. technically he's not my real dad, he was my grandfather. my biological dad was an abusive alcoholic- i never called him dad. he never deserved that title. 

i don't want to be in a world without my dad, he made everything so happy and beautiful and now it's like i'm stuck perpetually in winter. i just want to go and be where he is, and i tried. i tried to throw myself in front of a train, which was more of a humiliating event instead of a traumatic event. my social worker tackled me down on the platform, and i was kicking and screaming in front of the afternoon commuters, begging her to let me go because i was unhappy, because it was unfair of her to force me to stay here without him. i think i was recorded, and then the platform staff had to haul me away and i was gawked at crying and bleeding. i ran off, pushed someone out of a taxi to go back home and drank myself stupid for like a week to try recover. i only have one working kidney so the vodka and martini didn't agree with me remotely. 

i like what being high makes me feel, i like that i tether away and i float and that makes me feel closer to my dad. it makes me feel warm, that i leave winter and step into summer. i like disconnecting from everyone and being alone, i don't like being high in the company of others it's my time and i want it to be kept like that. my social worker tries to get me to socialise, she thinks if i join an art club i'll decide being around people is better than being high. she's angry every time i say no, but i don't care about pleasing her. grief has made me more selfish, that is one sober thought that stays true. my doctor tries to stop my valium prescription but i threaten to kill myself if she does that, and she's easily guilt tripped which i should feel bad for- but i don't. not one bit. 

i think it's affecting me badly, i don't remember anything and every day is a blur, and i don't really eat so my body feels awful but i don't care. i think a part of me is spitefully happy with the damage, i like knowing one day i might overdose and be with my dad and i don't care about anything else but going back to him. i miss his voice, i miss his routine even the menial stuff like he'd always have to watch a quiz show with his dinner at exactly 5pm, and he would have a coffee at 2pm to keep himself awake. i miss going shopping with him, i miss how tightly he held me because no one has held me that tightly since he's passed. i just miss my dad. i miss him more than anything else in this awful fucking world.

With Hario filters, I often struggled to fully bring out the taste notes of my beans. But ever since switching to Cafec, it feels much easier to highlight those flavors.

1ira1qf,https://i.redd.it/brfisp6w7mje1.jpeg,The Widow And The Clown,"Jester had clones everywhere. He saw every confession whispered in the dark, every moment of solidarity shared between wizards. He knew their fears, their joys, their sins. But it was only ever wizards—why would he waste his attention on the powerless?  

That was, until he saw Maria.  

A grieving widow with no magic, no status, no grand role in the world’s affairs. On the surface, she was nothing. But the fire in her eyes—the cold, unyielding rage buried beneath her grief—caught his attention. She loathed his sister just as much as he did. And that made her useful.  

In the months after Vincent’s death, Jester was there. Never in person, never directly, but his whispers found her all the same. A stranger passing by, muttering about Samantha in hushed tones. A conversation at a marketplace, lamenting the corruption of wizards in power. A pamphlet slipped under her door, detailing the injustices of the Council. Small, seemingly inconsequential things—just enough to push her in the right direction. Planting seeds. Letting them fester.  

Then, after nearly a year, he made his move.  

A knock on her door.  

When she opened it, she found a man she didn’t recognize—tall, confident, well-dressed, but unfamiliar. Jester had sent a clone, one in a human form, stripped of his usual mockery and flair. He greeted her as if they were old friends and, without hesitation, asked her a simple question:  

“What do you think of Samantha?”  

Maria hesitated. She had spent months biting her tongue, pretending to be grateful for the so-called kindness of the woman who had taken Vincent from her. “I owe her my life,” she lied smoothly, though every word burned her throat.  

Jester only smiled, seeing straight through her. “Oh, Maria,” he sighed. “You don’t have to pretend. I know the truth. I know what really happened to your husband.”  

And then he told her.  

Vincent hadn’t simply died. He had seen something—Samantha’s true form. A horror beyond comprehension. His mind had grasped it for a fleeting second, a moment of divine understanding, before collapsing under the weight of it. Samantha hadn’t struck him down; she had simply watched as he crumpled, his mind unraveling into nothing. Then, like a piece of broken furniture, she had carted him away, never telling Maria the truth.  

Maria listened in silence, her fingers curling into fists.  

The woman who had taken her in, given her shelter, let her believe she was safe—had killed Vincent with her very existence. And instead of confessing, instead of even allowing Maria to grieve properly, she had played the savior. As if that erased what she had done.  

Maria’s breath came slow and measured, but her rage was a wildfire beneath her ribs. “And why,” she asked, voice steady but laced with venom, “are you telling me this?”  

Jester leaned back against her doorframe, arms crossed casually. “Because I want her dead just as much as you do. She’s my sister, you see. And she’s done awful, awful things to our family.”  

Maria didn’t trust him—not yet. But she listened.  

For the next month, they planned. She agreed to meet him in person, but only on one condition: she wanted to see the real him. Not a clone. Not a fake. The actual Jester.  

He accepted the challenge without hesitation.  

And so, for the first time in months, Jester left the RNA building. He strode toward the Little Lamplight with a swagger in his step, head held high, mind brimming with possibilities. Maria Madroon was a fire waiting to be stoked. A young soul, raw with grief, blind with rage. He could give her power—enough to move mountains, enough to break gods. Enough to rip Samantha’s world apart.  

And when she was done, he would dig into the wound she left behind.  

—  

Jester adjusted his tie before knocking.   

When Maria opened the door, her expression was unreadable. The room was spotless, except for a cold cup of coffee sitting on the table. Maria pulled up a third chair for Jester to sit in, but he walked over and sat in Vincent’s chair, ignoring her.  

Maria’s expression flickered just slightly as he sat in that chair. She swallowed whatever words she wanted to say, sitting in the chair she pulled up for Jester.  

“So,” she said, voice calm. “Are you the real one?”  

In response, Jester extended a hand. His index finger shifted, stretching unnaturally, and then sharpened into a talon. Without hesitation, he pressed it against his arm and dragged downward. Blood welled at the wound. A trickle of proof.  

Maria watched in silence.  

Jester grinned, leaning in. His voice was smooth, coaxing. “Now, tell me, little Miss Madroon. What do you want?”  

Maria’s fingers twitched at her side, as if she was nervous.  

Jester didn’t care.  

“You could have anything,” he continued. “Power beyond measure. The strength to move mountains. The will to bring gods to their knees. The means to make my sister suffer.”  

He saw the flicker in her eyes at that last one. He smiled.  

Maria took a slow, measured breath. Then she lifted her hand from under the table.  

Jester saw the gun.  

He laughed, shaking his head. “Silly Maria. Put that down before you do something you’ll regret.” He gestured lazily at her. “You’ll throw away all this potential—and your own life—if you make the wrong choice.”  

Maria pointed the gun at Jester’s face.  

Jester grinned wider.  

Maria steadied her breath.  

Jester’s smile twisted, something inhuman lurking beneath his expression.  

Maria Madroon squeezed the trigger.  

Jester went limp.  

“Prideful asshole.”   

His body slumped forward against the table, blood oozing across the wood.  

Maria didn’t hesitate. She grabbed his tie and dragged his lifeless body toward the door, her grip firm on the anti-magic handgun in her other hand.  

She had a councilor to kill.  

The devil knocked with silver tongue,
A whispered deal, a song unsung.
“Take my hand, embrace your fate,
I’ll give you power—just name the weight.”  

But grief is steel and rage is fire,
Not something bartered, bought, or hired.
She met his gaze with hollow eyes,
A widow’s heart, a blade disguised.  

“You speak of gifts and endless might,
Of tearing gods down from their heights.
But I have learned—through blood and bone—
Magic leaves us all alone.”  

A breath, a pause, a sudden spark,
The phantom laughed, his smile dark.
“Then waste your chance, deny your role,
What’s left for you, a broken soul?”  

She answered not with words, but lead,
A final gift, a promise fed.
The devil slumped, his breath grew thin,
No deals were struck—she chose to win.  

Through silent halls, her footsteps fell,
A hunter freed from sorrow’s spell.
For what was left of Maria Madroon?
Only the storm, and its coming ruin.  

/uw Jester is dead. The clones have all gone inactive, standing frozen doing whatever they were doing as jester was killed. The post is interactive as in you can either talk to Samantha (she’s in the council building) or you can talk to Maria (she’s leaving the Lamplight, on the island with the Black Lake.

1ira0k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1ira0k6/severe_allergic_reaction_allergy_history_stress/,Severe allergic reaction & allergy history - stress?,"Hi all. Long post but I would really appreciate any insight or ideas after feeling quite anxious about my health and allergies. For some background: I’m 30F and have always had seasonal allergies, mainly standard hay fever and asthma a few times. About 2 years ago, I randomly had a severe allergic reaction. It started with my skin getting red and flushed and itching, and gradually my eyes swelling and hives on the body. I am quite sure this was caused by using an old vitamin C serum I hadn’t used in a while, because the skin reaction started and was more pronounced in the areas I used the serum. I had to do a course of steroids and antihistamines and gradually it got better.

Fast forward to last summer, I had a layover in an airport. I ate an oatmeal with bananas, soy milk and almond butter and a coffee with soy milk (all things I have had before and have regularly). About 20 minutes after as I am boarding the flight, my eyes start itching like crazy. When I get on the flight I notice them swelling. Within 10 minutes my eyes are swollen, my skin is flushed, and I have hives all over my body. I’m super anxious about staying on an 8 hour flight and eventually end up deboarding and going to the hospital where I’m prescribed prednisone and antihistamines. I’m better within a day or two.

I did blood allergy and skin prick tests after this, which found severe dust mite and pollen allergies as well as soy, coffee and a few other food items that I eat ALL the time. I was quite flummoxed by the food allergy results and not sure how to interpret. I started on oral immunotherapy to treat my pollen and dust mite allergies.

Fast forward to this week. I have a big workshop coming up at work that I’ve been prepping for weeks and am feeling quite nervous for. The morning of the workshop I have eggs (daily breakfast) and a matcha with soy milk (also regular drink). As I enter the conference room area, my left eye starts itching. Within 15 minutes - both eyes are HUGELY swollen and I’m flushed, red, and with hives. This time I immediately recognised what was happening. I felt terrible but I had to leave the workshop and go to urgent care. I took a few antihistamines and was seen by the doctor like half an hour later who immediately gave me a steroid shot. By the end of the day, my swelling was much better. 

I’m now feeling very anxious about what is going on. My allergist told me it’s possible to have allergies that are only triggered in combination with other things (so you may have soy, coffee, almonds regularly but if you had them all together and you’re stressed and exposed to dust etc it can trigger a more severe reaction) but I’m struggling to understand this. The common denominator in my last two attacks is the soy milk and the closed, busy environment of the airport/ conference room, and perhaps stress? Could it be the stress that triggers an immune response to something I’m often exposed to?

I know this is a very specific case but I’d just love to hear others experiences and thoughts. I’ve been lucky in not having any respiratory symptoms but I’m still quite anxious about these episodes and not knowing what triggers them. Thank you!",1,1739761303.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

She was late—rushing, breathless, clutching her notes like they were lifelines. I was on time, waiting, watching. She told me she pulled an all-nighter to review for the MTLE, her voice laced with exhaustion. She ordered an Americano, desperate to stay awake. I ordered lemonade and smiled at her. “We’re healthier now,” I said. She looked at me, puzzled, but didn’t question it when I paid for both of us.

She sighed, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. “I feel like God is silent,” she whispered, her voice barely above a breath. “Like I’m alone in this battle.”

I reached for her hand, squeezing it gently. “You were never alone,” I told her. “God was with you all along.”

Her eyes searched mine, filled with the kind of uncertainty I remembered all too well. “I’m scared,” she admitted. “I don’t think I’m prepared. What if I don’t pass?”

I smiled—softly, knowingly. “Relax,” I said. “You passed.”

She froze. Her fingers tightened around her cup. Her eyes, wide with disbelief, flickered with something fragile—hope.

“I did?” she asked, almost afraid to believe it.

I nodded. “You did.”

Her breath hitched. She shook her head, trying to grasp a reality that still felt out of reach.

“And the others?” she asked, hesitant. “My batchmates… I keep comparing myself to them. It makes me feel—”

“You don’t have to,” I interrupted gently. “The entire batch? 100% passing rate.”

Tears welled up in her eyes. A shaky breath left her lips. Relief. A burden she had carried for so long, finally lifting.

She glanced at her watch and sighed. “I need to go,” she said, determination settling into her voice. “I have to study.”

I nodded. “Go. But know this—everything will fall into place.”

She stood, but before she could leave, I pulled her into a tight hug. She stiffened for a second, then melted into it, holding on like she didn’t want to let go.

At the door, she turned back, watching as I bowed my head and prayed for her. When I looked up, she was smiling—small, but real.

“I’ll see you again,” I told her. “And when I do, you’ll have RMT after your name.”

She grinned. One last glance, one final nod, and then she was gone.

And I sat there, staring at the empty chair, heart full—because I knew she would be okay.",29,1739761277.0,MedTechPH,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Today my ex decided to reach back out to me. We have been going no contact for about two months since the beginning of December and she messaged me saying how physically affectionate deprived she is and how she has nobody else that she feels comfortable sleeping next to and she just needs some cuddles

She was asking if that was something I would be comfortable with doing. no sex, just cuddles and of course, me loving cuddles and being really good at it I caved lol 

I’m also a little bit physically affectionally deprived but since I’ve started to move on and be okay with being alone, I of course wasn’t going to reach out to her, but since I want what is best for her, I’m going to go over there tomorrow night and cuddle with her 

I know I shouldn’t do it and my therapist is going to give me an earful on Wednesday but at the end of the day. 

I know that she’s not the woman that I would wanna date and the issues we had that caused us to break up are still very much there 

so for the time being I’m just going to try to set up some boundaries for myself so we can both get the physical affection and intimacy from each other while not getting any of the relationship and other dependencies of it. 

It’s going to be hard because I love cooking breakfast for her and making her coffee but if I’m only going over there for cuddles, then I need to make sure that I leave early in the morning and I do nothing else for her because I don’t wanna get sucked back in 

Thanks for reading my little rant and I wish y’all the best.

1ir9wr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthorAlly/comments/1ir9wr1/the_beginning_of_my_story_can_i_get_some_feedback/,The beginning of my story. Can I get some feedback,"Organelle is our world. One more sophisticated than the one that once belonged to our visitors. One more civilized than the cruel world from which they came. This is the beginning of our story.

It was a cold clear night Organelle was shaken, the sky disturbed by strange flashing lights as a loud boom would wake even the heaviest of sleepers. 

Those curious enough to look to the sky got the sight of a large pink fireball as it comes down and crashing into a nearby forest. 

“What the hell was that!” Was the general response from the residents who were awakened

In Plas nothing is accidental, nothing is random, everything has a reason so what is the reason for this?

The event sparked curiosity from onlookers as a few questioned if Organelle is under attack and the authorities are called to respond 

Those who could not contain their curious nature decided to investigate for themselves and as they followed the path of charred and broken branches they were met with an even more confusing sight.

A white disc. Standing five feet high and roughly twelve feet across. One side appears to be torn open  while inside lay three comatose bodies, seen by those who dared to approach the object.

As the authorities arrive with rifles in hand peering inside. “They are alive but the crash seems to have knocked them unconscious. We will take them to the military hospital and question them later.” “What if they are enemies?” Asked an onlooker. With little hesitation the officer calmly answered “We will make sure they are heavily guarded in case they are hostile. Now everyone.. go home and get some rest the situation will be handled properly and we will update the public on the situation as it develops”. 

At the site of the crash the crowd has cleared and the authorities are to transport the pod down to the military hospital. One person takes out a small hand held device used to open a portal down to the lower dimension of Plas. 

Waiting for them are a number of professionals in various fields including one named Luna, a military psychiatrist and psychologist, she has been called to study the three visitors as they are taken in on stretchers. Even though they are unconscious they will be put into an induced coma during the study.

The first test performed is a memory scan which brings up the last images and emotions that were experienced by the visitors. As they watch what looks to be an apocalyptic end and feelings of fear and dread and confusion gives insight that what has happened was an act of desperation for a world that has destroyed itself. 

“It appears these beings are searching to recolonize” says Luna “However it’s apparent they have a destructive nature. We will need to do further screening. Individual sessions in the Dream Machine will tell us everything we need to know.”

“Are you sure about how ethical this is Luna? Given they have just been through a traumatic experience, the Dream Machine might be too much and traumatizing for them not knowing it’s just a simulation.” 

Luna paused. Considering such a thing. “We know they are destructive creatures, and from the memory scan they appear vicious. We need to know what type of threat they pose before they wake up. You’re asking me if empathy towards a potential threat is more important than safety? My heart wants to be empathetic but my mind wants no part in such a risk.”

While Lucy, Harlow and Dalton are comatose the question on everyone’s mind is “What do we do with the visitors?” 

Not knowing what to do Luna reaches out to the leaders of the underground nations. She reaches out to them in the hopes of any ideas on what should be done.

“We cannot send them back. They have no place to call home. If they are capable of being civilians do we allow them to have citizenship in Plas, if they are able to assimilate?” While Luna is a psychiatrist she often talks to herself as a coping mechanism as she waits for answers.

A few hours go by before Luna receives a call. It’s Wexle, the leader of Ri “I believe we may have a solution if you’re willing to listen.” 

“What if we take this incident as an opportunity to advance our species and finally become a type one civilization? I feel that if it were to be believed that the visitors were actually divine beings with a message we could greatly influence the culture of Plas. I propose to you we create a book, simply called the Book of Life. It would contain intellectual, and ethical laws that could lead to the creation of new knowledge and allow us to establish our world so we don’t perish. Type zero civilizations come to a bloody end, twice, while type one is not only survival but of great opportunity.”

Luna asks “What do we do with the visitors? We can’t kill them”

Wexle calmly replies “We won’t kill them but they must stay underground, you have given me an idea just now Luna. We run a fake news story that the visitors have later died in hospital as a result of their injuries. We also state that there was some memory screening done and the information will not be released until the end of the investigation.”

Luna considers this for a few minutes “We only get one chance to do this… can we really expect the residents of Plas to simply accept that they have died and left behind a message? I mean, I give them more respect than that.” Luna takes a deep breath. “I have an idea. What if we were to download the required personality changes into their existing minds, erasing their previous memories and replacing them with their Dream Machine experience?”

“Knowing that the next phase of existence is a bundle of nerves their physical bodies should reflect that and be made of energy. A ghost. To represent what is to come. This solution may be more difficult but it is also more profound.”

Lucy, Harlow and Dalton lay comatose in hospital beds, an IV in their arm to keep them asleep and electrodes on their heads attached to a computer. The screen will show images of what they see and recognize their emotions as they go through the experience. Luna is to watch the screen and record the experience to later assess the visitors nature and background

Luna gets ready to do her work, as she sits down and gets her paperwork ready her phone rings. It’s Helgan, the president of Mito. “Good morning Luna I have heard about the situation involving visitors what is the plan?”

Luna answers “Well, Wexle has made the offer that we use this incident as the opportunity for an experiment to bring religion to Organelle.”

“Fascinating, do you suppose we add to this idea? It would be a good opportunity for Mito to expand on its practice possibly we introduce a fictional story that follows the workings of the the Cosmic Wheel?”

Luna answers “We can try but should the story reflect the Dream Machine simulation?”

“Yes of course, possibly the story of the Cosmic wheel is a fiction of the visitors and their Demi Gods as their past this could be a fascinating experiment.”

“We will look into developing a story of their past and broadcast it as a documentary perhaps?”Helgan replies “It is just a thought, we will get to work and present it to you once we have it completed”

Luna returns with “Should we contact the leader of Endo, Mystique?”

Helgan is enthusiastic “Absolutely yes! She is the queen of propaganda this could be an amazing show! We will create a film and pretend it is derived from the memory scan it will be genius!”

Luna decides before she continues to reach out to Yeshua, the king of Nuc

“Sorry to bother you at this hour Yesuha but do you have time to talk?”

Yesuha answers with “I am quite busy however if this is regarding the incident I’m willing to speak with you on the subject”

“I am at a loss of what is to be done with these visitors so I am reaching out to all of you so we can develop a strategy”

Luna explains the current situation and the options that have been presented to Yeshua who is silent on the other end 

“This is indeed a great opportunity that we cannot waste. Listen to me, we can re program them into much more than what the Dream Machine has to offer. I propose when it comes to the Dream Machine that is simple propaganda and we program them instead with the basic principles of the worlds of our allies. We make them into prophets teaching their worlds in a way that is figurative and we see how Plas reacts. Make sure they are not killed and they have the time and opportunity to preach the message and have their behaviour divine.”

“How do you suppose we make their behaviour divine?” Asks Luna

“With the Walk of Virtue. We have them live accordingly to it’s teachings and to not behave outside of it’s laws. We will make them perfect in the eyes of future believers. We make them into mystics”

“I have high hopes for this experiment, Luna. We will put together a plan. If the people of Plas are smart they will listen to the visitors turned prophets.”

“I’m afraid.. Yesuha what if they are not?”

Yeshua is silent “We must make sure they listen even if we bedazzle them with it in the form of entertainment first. The message has to get out and we hope that somebody is paying attention”

“This is our chance to become a higher species, Luna, but we need the collective mindset to understand it and it’s importance for it to ever become a reality. I’m afraid that if we continue as a type zero civilization this world will destroy itself. We cannot allow such a thing.”

Luna asks, with a bit of nervousness in her voice “Should we meet? To discuss this?”

“Yes of course. You just finish your report and I will arrange a meeting for all of us as soon as possible. Best of luck to you on your findings I look forward to hearing about it.” Yeshua says as he hangs up.

Luna sits down in a leather chair next to the three bodies. She buries her face in her hands as she knows she’s not getting any sleep tonight. She thinks out loud “No sleep, plus meeting with world leaders, how do I keep it together? This is happening so fast how am I going to do this report in one night and present it first thing in the morning? *sigh* Okay I guess we’re doing this”

1ir9wjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1ir9wjs/new_theory_about_the_secret/,New Theory about the Secret,"I've been going back through some of the old episodes to see what I've missed and just because it's such a good go to binge watch. I truly believe that once Colton got to know Del he only wanted to stay with her because he thought Evie had rejected him. I'm also thinking now, that Del was pregnant with Kat and he felt he had to stay with her as I am rewatching certain episodes again. No one has mentioned the reason why Kat it's so much older than Jacob. I think she was pregnant when she left (per the last episode)and at some point she told Colton she was pregnant by then he was probably with Evelyn and it broke them up which is why Evelyn turned into such a horrible person. She lost Colton twice. There was a point after the masquerade party at lingermore where Del and Evelyn we're talking at the coffee shop and Evelyn said that Del owed her more than just for not pressing charges. I bet you that's about her being pregnant by Colton. It's also possible that Kat isn't Colton's daughter and she never told Colton about it. That could be the secret that she said that Alice would see her as a bad person.  And I know everyone's going to say well then Kat shouldn't be able to travel through the pond. But that's not true because lots of people travel through the pond as we have been finding out. I was just watching an episode where Elliot went back to see Colton again. Colton knew that he was Elliot. If he didn't know he was Elliot he knew he was a time traveler by him saying the statement ""I understand"" when Elliot said he was just passing through. Over Colton's lifetime he must have seen many people come through the pond just as he had gone back and forth through the pond. And The Tell-Tale sign that someone had been in the pond is when they show up soaking wet. ",3,1739760954.0,TheWayHomeHallmark,10,0.71,False

The Health Benefits of Choosing Vegan Hot Chocolate Over Traditional Options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to warming up with a delightful drink, hot chocolate is a beloved choice worldwide. However, as more people become aware of the benefits of plant-based diets, vegan hot chocolate has emerged as a tasty alternative. Choosing vegan hot chocolate not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also provides several health advantages over traditional options. Let’s explore why making the switch can be beneficial for both you and the planet.

### Lower in Saturated Fat

One of the main ingredients in traditional hot chocolate is dairy milk, which is high in saturated fat. Consuming excessive amounts of saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels and contribute to cardiovascular issues. Vegan hot chocolate, typically made with almond, oat, or coconut milk, is generally lower in saturated fat. This makes it a heart-healthier choice for those looking to cut back on unhealthy fats.

### Increased Nutritional Value

Vegan hot chocolate recipes often include nutrient-dense ingredients, enhancing the overall nutritional profile. Here are a few common additions:

- **Cacao Powder:** Rich in antioxidants, cacao can help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.
- **Nut Milks:** Almond, cashew, or oat milk provides additional vitamins and minerals like vitamin E and calcium.
- **Sweeteners like Maple Syrup:** Natural sweeteners often come with trace nutrients that white sugar lacks.

By opting for vegan recipes, you're not just enjoying a sweet treat; you're also nourishing your body with vitamins and minerals that support overall health.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Lower Sugar Content

Many traditional hot chocolate mixes are loaded with sugar, which can lead to various health issues including weight gain and energy crashes. Vegan hot chocolate can easily be made with less sugar, or you can replace refined sugar with healthier alternatives like agave syrup or stevia. By choosing less sugary options, you maintain steady energy levels and avoid unnecessary calorie intake.

### Environmental Impact

Choosing vegan options can also have a positive impact on the environment. Dairy farming is resource-intensive, requiring vast amounts of water and land. In contrast, plant-based alternatives generally have a smaller environmental footprint. By opting for vegan hot chocolate, you contribute to a more sustainable food system, which is essential for the health of our planet.

### Ethical Considerations

Switching to vegan hot chocolate aligns with ethical considerations regarding animal welfare. The dairy industry is often scrutinized for its treatment of animals. By choosing plant-based ingredients, you support cruelty-free practices, allowing you to enjoy your hot chocolate with a clear conscience.

### Versatility and Creativity

Vegan hot chocolate opens the door to a world of flavors and creativity. You can customize your drink to suit your taste preferences. Consider adding:

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
- **Spices:** Cinnamon or nutmeg can add warmth and depth.
- **Vegan Whipped Cream:** For a decadent finishing touch.
- **Flavors:** Peppermint, vanilla, or even chili for a unique twist.

This versatility means you'll never get bored with your warm beverage choice, allowing you to experiment and find new favorite combinations.

### Promotes Wellness

Vegan hot chocolate can also promote wellness by incorporating superfoods. Consider adding:

- **Turmeric:** Known for its anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Maca Powder:** To enhance energy and mood.
- **Chia Seeds:** Packed with omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.

These additions not only enhance flavor but offer numerous health benefits, making your hot chocolate a wellness drink.

Making the switch to vegan hot chocolate can provide various health benefits. With lower saturated fat, increased nutritional value, and a lesser environmental impact, opting for this delightful drink is a smart choice. Plus, the freedom to experiment with flavors allows you to create your perfect cozy beverage. So next time you're in the mood for a warm treat, reach for a vegan option and embrace the flavors and benefits that come with it!

### Conclusion

As the winter months roll in, there's nothing quite like a warm cup of hot chocolate to bring comfort and joy. Exploring 10 delicious vegan hot chocolate recipes offers not only a delightful way to cozy up but also an opportunity to embrace a healthier lifestyle. Each recipe, ranging from classic to creative, provides unique flavors and textures that cater to both your cravings and dietary preferences.

Opting for vegan hot chocolate can be a smart choice for your health. With plant-based ingredients, these recipes often pack in fewer calories and sugars while offering a rich source of antioxidants.

You can enjoy the creamy satisfaction of hot chocolate without the heavy side effects that sometimes come with traditional options.

Moreover, embracing vegan hot chocolate supports sustainable living. By selecting plant-based ingredients, you contribute to a reduction in your carbon footprint and promote animal welfare. It’s a win-win situation—treat yourself while being kind to the planet.

1ir9rdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNightmares/comments/1ir9rdp/banquet_of_shadows/,Banquet of Shadows,"# The Tower of Glass



I stand at the floor-to-ceiling window of my penthouse suite, high above the glittering city. Night has draped itself over the skyline like a velvet shroud. From up here, the streets below are a silent grid of lights, and the distant horns and sirens are hushed to an almost imperceptible murmur. The glass before me reflects my silhouette—tall, sharp-shouldered, and solitary—superimposed over the metropolis I built. In that reflection, I loom over the miniature city like an emperor surveying his dominion.



Everything I see, I *own* in one way or another. The skyscrapers with their glowing logos owe their steel and glass to my industries. The satellites orbiting above feed data to the networks I control. Even the electric cars gliding through the avenues at this late hour run on batteries from my factories. My ambition crafted an empire of technology and wealth that spans continents and touches the edge of space. I have *reached*, as Napoleon once did, for a glory that places me above lesser men.



Yet tonight, a hollow feeling gnaws at my chest, one that the panoramic view cannot soothe. The city lights below seem colder than usual, as if their sparkle is taunting me rather than celebrating me. I press my hand against the cool glass. In the dark reflection, my eyes look sunken, ringed by shadows. **When did I last sleep?** I cannot recall. Lately I’ve been working endless nights planning the next conquest—another merger, another colony on the bleeding edge of science. Great men aren’t afforded the luxury of rest, I tell myself. Still, the unease clings to me like a damp fog.



Far below, along the grid of streets, I notice points of amber light flaring and dying. At first I think they are just the burn of cigarettes or the wink of tail lights. But some remain, flickering in clusters. **Fire?** A ribbon of worry coils in my stomach. It could be bonfires or burning trash…or riots. I can’t tell from this height. For a moment, it almost looks like the city is smoldering at the edges. I squint and lean closer to the glass, but the angle is wrong; the details drown in darkness and distance.



I exhale, leaving a brief fog on the glass. Perhaps it’s nothing—my mind playing tricks with the mosaic of lights. With a soft grunt of dismissal, I turn away from the window. My reflection trails in the corner of my eye, and I catch a distortion in it—**a second shape** just behind me. I whirl around, heartbeat lurching. The room is empty. Marble floor, modern art on the walls, sleek furniture…no intruder. Only my own restless imagination populating the shadows. I run a hand through my hair and allow a dry chuckle at my nerves. **Ghosts in the glass, that’s all.**



I cross the expansive living area to my desk, determined to shake off these jitters. Empires aren’t run on doubt and fear. They are built on **will**, on an unshakeable certainty that one deserves to rule. I have that will—I’ve proven it in boardrooms and on factory floors, in launching rockets and rallying investors. I brush my fingers over a heavy paperweight on the desk: a bronze coin stamped with Nero’s profile, a trophy from an auction years ago. *Nero fiddled while Rome burned*, the saying goes. A foolish, mad emperor from a bygone era… nothing to do with me. I clench the coin in my fist until the ridges bite into my skin. Whatever those fires below are, I will handle them come morning. For now, I have work to do.



# Whispers in the Dark



The estate is silent save for the soft hum of servers and the thump of my heart in my ears. Hours have passed; the clock on my desk reads 3:13 AM. I’ve been reviewing financial reports, but the lines of numbers blur and dance on the screen. My eyes ache. At some point I must have nodded off, because I catch myself jerk awake, a drop of cold sweat sliding down my temple. The room is bathed in the low blue glow of monitors. I rub my face, trying to dispel the grogginess. **Just a short break**, I think. Perhaps I should lie down for a moment.



Leaning back in my leather chair, I let my heavy eyelids close. The events of the past week swim behind them. Board meetings, angry headlines, a flurry of tweets from critics and trolls… The world beyond these walls has grown hostile, almost ungrateful. **After all I’ve done,** I muse bitterly. I gave them electric cars, reusable rockets, dreams of Mars—and in return, some dare to vilify me. The thought makes my temples throb. *They should be thanking me, not sharpening their knives.*



In the edge of consciousness, I hear something—a soft hiss, like a breath against my ear. I freeze, gripping the armrests. **Was that… a voice?** The quiet stretches. I scan the dim office lit by the screen’s glow. Nobody. My security detail is posted at ground level and the elevators. No one could bypass the alarms to reach this floor without an announcement. It must have been my imagination, or maybe the air conditioning kicking on.



I let out a long breath and start to rise, intent on heading to bed. Suddenly, **a whisper**—distinct and cold—slides through the silence: *“…eat the dark enlightened rich…”*



The phrase is so faint I wonder if I heard it at all. It creeps into my brain like a spider, each word articulated slowly, in a raspy almost reverent tone. I spin around, heart pounding so hard it hurts. **“Who’s there?!”** My voice echoes off polished marble and glass. No answer. The lights from my monitors cast shifting shadows, but nothing moves. I am utterly alone in the vast penthouse—apart from that voice which now fades into memory, already doubting itself.



I step backward until I feel the wall against me, my hands fumbling for the light switch. The overhead lights blaze on, flooding every sleek corner with sterile white illumination. I stand there shaking, eyes darting from the automated doors to the darkened bedroom doorway, to the corners behind the sofas. *There is no one here.* The security feed on my phone shows empty hallways, sealed entrances.



Yet I could swear I felt **breath** against my ear with those words. *Eat the dark enlightened rich.* Nonsense, yet…not nonsense. A threat. A warning. A curse. My mind connects it to that old revolutionary saying, *“Eat the rich.”* The venomous slogan has surfaced lately in protests against inequality. I saw a sign with those words on the news just yesterday, held aloft by a furious young face in a crowd. *Eat the rich.* But **“dark enlightened rich”**…that part is new, warped, like something from a nightmare.



I realize I’m still pressing myself to the wall, heart hammering. For the first time in years, I feel truly vulnerable. Angrily, I shake it off. “You’re exhausted, that’s all,” I mutter to myself. Too many days of stress and too much caffeine. The mind plays tricks. I force myself to walk slowly through each room of the penthouse, checking behind sculptures, inside the guest bathroom, even under the bed like a child warding off boogeymen. Of course, I find nothing except my own racing thoughts.



Before switching the lights back off, I double-check the advanced security system’s console on the wall. All sensors normal. No breaches, no glitches. The building’s AI quietly awaits my next command. Everything is normal. Everything is secure.



So why do I feel eyes on me still? I shiver and adjust the thermostat up a notch, suddenly cold. Perhaps I should call down to the security team—have them do a sweep of the building perimeter. But what would I tell them? That I heard a ghost whisper ancient threats in my ear? I can already imagine the wary looks. No, I won’t show weakness.



Instead, I pour myself a glass of water from the minibar and swallow it down, trying to wash away the lump of dread in my throat. The taste is oddly metallic. In the quiet, I whisper the phrase once to myself, testing it: *“Eat the dark enlightened rich.”* The words leave a bitter taste on my tongue, as if speaking them gives them power. I almost expect something to answer from the shadows. But there is only silence, thick and heavy.



Fine. If my mind is my enemy tonight, I will outlast it. I sink onto the edge of my king-sized bed, not bothering to undress, and glare into the dark corners of the room. “I am the master of this house,” I say under my breath, a defiant mantra. “I am in control.” I keep repeating those words in my head even as I eventually drift into a fitful, haunted sleep. Outside, faint sirens wail and the wind whistles around the tower, sounding disturbingly like distant, manic laughter.



# Phantoms of Empire



Morning comes, pale and ashen. Sunlight fights its way through a haze of smog and smoke outside, painting my penthouse in diffused grey. I wake unrested, tangled in the sheets. **Dreams** plagued me in the few hours I slept—I can’t remember them fully, only fragments: a throng of faceless people reaching for me, and an endless fall from a throne high in the clouds. I shake off the images and rise, groggy and irritable.



Downstairs in the executive dining nook, I find my top aide waiting, tablet in hand. His presence startles me; I nearly drop the coffee cup I’m holding. “Sir,” he says with a tight nod, oblivious to my frayed nerves. “The board meeting is scheduled for this afternoon. Also… you should see this.” He hesitates before swiping the tablet. A live news feed pops up, displaying aerial footage of **crowds** gathered in the city center. Hundreds, maybe more, swarming like ants. The headline at the bottom scrolls: *UNREST GROWS AS INCOME GAP WIDENS — PROTESTS TARGET TECH “PHARAOHS.”*



My name is in the chyron as well, I spot it immediately. They’re chanting something in unison, but the helicopter audio is too faint to catch the words. Their upturned faces are pinpricks of anger. My stomach tightens. It’s one thing to suspect discontent; it’s another to see it manifested in the streets. “They were out there all night,” my aide says quietly. “Fires, vandalism… a few of our satellite offices downtown were defaced.” He clears his throat. “Graffiti mentioning you, by name. And a slogan we haven’t seen before.”



I already know what he will say. Even so, when the words leave his lips, a chill runs through me. “They’ve been painting **‘eat the dark enlightened rich’** on buildings and sidewalks.” He slides a photo into view: the side of our headquarters, my glorious tower at street level, marred by crude red lettering of that very phrase. The paint drips like blood in the early light. I stare at the image, feeling oddly detached. It’s as though I’m looking at a scene from some dystopian film—surely this isn’t *my* reality, *my* city.



“They think me enlightened, but dark…a dark enlightenment,” I murmur, half to myself. My aide gives me a puzzled look. I straighten my robe and hand the tablet back, masking my unease with irritation. “Clean it off,” I snap. “And increase the security around the building. I want no one getting past the front plaza.”



He nods and scurries off to make calls, leaving me alone with my thoughts—and the faint echo of that hateful slogan ringing in my mind. So it wasn’t a phantom voice conjured by fatigue after all. The phrase is real, born from the mouths of the angry masses. They have aimed it at people like me, perhaps *especially* at me. Dark enlightened rich… The words are oil and water, an oxymoron that sticks in the throat. Is that how they see us, the billionaire visionaries? As false prophets cloaked in darkness?



In my private study, I pace back and forth before a wall of accolades and portraits. Framed magazine covers bearing my face smile down at me in better days. *Visionary, Genius, Titan of Industry*, they herald. How many times did I boast that my companies were lifting humanity up, bringing light to the world? Enlightenment through technology. And yet in their eyes I am “dark.” A villain. I clench my fists until my nails bite my palms. They are simply envious, **afraid** of progress. I recall a quote of Napoleon’s I once took to heart: *“Great ambition is the passion of a great character.”* Was it not ambition that carried me from a garage startup to these heights? Yes — and lesser souls will always resent greatness.



My gaze drifts to an old painting on the opposite wall—one I hung there for inspiration. Napoleon Bonaparte astride a rearing horse, painted in grand oils. The conqueror crossing the Alps. This morning, the proud figure looks different to me. His eyes, usually fierce with purpose, seem almost hollow. The longer I stare, the more the painted eyes bore into mine with an accusatory weight, as if to say *Is this the destiny you wanted?* I blink and shake my head, stepping back. My exhaustion is making me imagine things again. But I cannot tear my gaze away from the painting just yet. *Napoleon met his end in exile*, a nagging thought whispers. He died on a lonely island, abandoned and reviled despite his genius.



I turn on my heel to escape that painted stare. My toe catches something on the rug—a book I had pulled from the shelf last night and dropped. It’s a volume of Roman history. As I stoop to pick it up, a photograph tucked between the pages flutters out. It’s an old newspaper clipping of me, standing with a shovel at the groundbreaking of my new aerospace campus. Right beside it is a headline: *“Billionaire’s Hubris Blamed in Launchpad Tragedy – Dozens Dead.”* My own smiling face is frozen in time above the story of an accident that claimed 30 of my workers two years ago. A memory stirs of closed-door settlements, payouts to grieving families, the way I convinced myself that it was a necessary sacrifice on the path to the stars.



My vision blurs. For an instant, I see *their* faces reflected on the glossy paper—the workers who died, the families whose names I never bothered to learn. They stare at me with hollow eyes like the crowd on the news, mouths opening in unison to hiss a familiar refrain. I don’t even realize I’ve said the words out loud until I hear my own tremulous whisper: *“eat the dark enlightened rich.”* The clipping slips from my fingers.



“No,” I snarl, stepping back as if the paper might bite. My pulse races in my throat. I will not be haunted by this. I swipe the clipping up and shove it back into the book, then hurl the book onto the desk face-down. The thump of it hitting wood jolts me into motion. I need to get out of this room—these walls are closing in.



I stride out into the corridor, nearly colliding with one of my personal security guards. He’s on high alert, earbud in, rifle slung over his shoulder. “Sir, apologies—there was a report of a disturbance on this floor?” he says. His eyes flick behind me into the study. I swallow hard, realizing he must have heard my raised voice.



“I’m fine,” I snap perhaps a bit too quickly. My nerves are raw. “No disturbance. Just the news upsetting me.”



He nods, but his gaze lingers on me a second longer than it should. Does he see it? The crack in the mask, the *weakness*? I tug my robe tighter and draw myself up. “Resume your post. And get someone to bring up breakfast.” Dismissing him, I march towards the dining hall. Food might steady me; I’ve hardly eaten since yesterday.



As I walk through the sunlit halls lined with modern sculptures and potted palms, I swear I catch new movements in my peripheral vision. Twice I spin toward what I think is someone trailing me, only to face emptiness. Once, I could have sworn a tall shadow slid just out of sight around a corner ahead. Each time, there is nothing. Only my own rapid breathing and the echo of my footsteps. The security guard’s radio crackles briefly behind me, and I startle so hard I nearly break into a run. *This is absurd*, I chastise myself. I refuse to be a frightened old man skulking in his own palace.



I force myself to slow down and straighten my back, glancing at a decorative mirror on the wall to compose my appearance. A pale, disheveled face stares back. Is that truly me—the great innovator, the billionaire king? There are dark circles under my eyes, and for the briefest moment, I almost don’t recognize my own face. It looks…haunted. In the reflection over my shoulder, the hallway behind me stretches empty. But as I turn away, I imagine that empty space filling with a crowd of silent figures, each one watching, waiting.



Before I enter the dining hall, I hear my phone buzz. Another alert. I pull it from my pocket with a flare of annoyance. It’s a mention on social media—thousands of them, actually, flooding in a tsunami of public fury. Against my better judgment, I open the app. The top comment sears itself into my eyes: a popular account has posted a image of Nero with a caption **“Rome has never been this brightly lit at night!”** and tagged it with my name. Thousands of replies below jeer at me as Nero reborn—the man who fiddles online while society burns. My own impulsive boast from last week is screenshot right beneath it: *“Our platform usage just hit an all-time high lol.”*



My head swims with shame and anger. I remember typing that out in a moment of pride, eager to prove my critics wrong as my social media site surged in engagement. I thought it humorous at the time. Now it reads like the jibe of a callous tyrant. The whole world took it as proof that I don’t care that everything is falling apart—that I’m laughing while flames rise. *Nero.* *Napoleon.* All my idols turned to insults flung at my feet.



A red haze creeps into the edges of my vision. My hand tightens around the phone until I hear the plastic creak. “Ungrateful wretches,” I hiss. In a sudden burst of rage, I hurl the phone across the hall. It smashes into the marble floor with a crack, bits of glass and electronics skittering. The sound echoes loudly. From far away, I think I hear a chorus of startled voices—perhaps my staff on the lower levels hearing the clatter. Let them hear. Let them see my anger. I will not be gentle Emperor Nero for them to mock. If it’s a tyrant they want, it’s a tyrant they’ll get.



Breathing heavily, I step into the dining hall, my vision still tinged at the corners with red. Sunlight pours in through tall windows, but even here the air feels dim and oppressive. A covered silver tray has been set on the long table by some silent servant. The aroma of a rich breakfast—truffles, eggs, coffee—wafts toward me. My stomach growls, reminding me of my hunger. I lift the silver lid to reveal a perfectly cooked steak and poached eggs, still steaming. Normally such indulgence in the morning would make me smile. But as I stare at the meat, pink juices pooling on the porcelain plate, a wave of nausea hits me.



The steak’s texture, the redness… for one horrifying instant, it resembles a slab of raw flesh torn from some creature. The smell grows cloying and coppery in my nose. *Eat,* a voice in my mind whispers. *Eat, eat, eat.* My hands tremble as I grasp the table edge. I will *not* be cowed by a piece of meat. I force myself into a chair and pick up the silver fork and knife.



Cutting into the steak, however, releases a trickle of crimson that drips across the white plate. My vision tunnels. It looks like blood on a canvas of snow. I blink and suddenly I’m not holding a dining knife but a bloody **dagger**, ancient and gold-hilted, and the meat on my plate… it’s **heart-shaped** and grotesquely human.



With a cry, I shove back from the table. The hallucination (for surely it must be that) vanishes. The knife and fork clatter to the floor, just metal utensils once more. The steak is just steak. But I can’t unsee it; I can’t stomach this food. My appetite is gone, replaced by a roiling sickness and a terrible understanding: the phrase that has been haunting me is not just a threat from without. It’s inside me now, coiled in my guts. *Eat the dark enlightened rich.* It’s as if the very idea has poisoned the act of eating.



Gasping for air, I stumble away from the table. I feel eyes on me again—imagined onlookers watching me retch at the sight of my own excess. Above the mantel of the dining hall hangs another painting: Emperor Nero in a laurel wreath, playing his lyre amidst flames. A fanciful depiction I acquired for amusement long ago. Now the painted Nero’s lips seem twisted in a cruel smile. The background fire in the artwork flickers—no, I swear the flames actually flicker, as if alive. I blink rapidly, backing out of the room, my pulse a drumbeat of panic.



As I flee, the chorus of that infernal phrase follows me, not spoken aloud but thundering in my mind with every step: *Eat the dark enlightened rich. Eat the dark enlightened rich.*



# The Unraveling



I retreat to my private quarters and lock the doors. By afternoon the sky outside has bruised purple, storm clouds gathering. Rain lashes at the glass, and thunder rumbles like distant artillery. The world beyond has grown more chaotic by the hour—my head of security reported that protests have now spread to surround my tower. They mass at the gates, held back by barriers and armed guards. The stock market is plummeting today as well, dragging my fortune down with it. *The beginnings of a siege,* I think. Perhaps not with pitchforks and torches, but a siege nonetheless.



I’ve taken to pacing the length of my study, a pistol clutched in my sweaty palm. I had almost forgotten I even owned a gun, but in a burst of desperation I fetched it from its safe. The weight of it gives me a fleeting sense of control. Each time thunder cracks, I flinch and my finger itches at the trigger. My nerves are stretched thin as wire. I haven’t dared to turn on the news again, nor check the internet. I can’t bear to see more mocking comparisons to mad kings and fallen emperors. I know they’re out there, multiplying like vipers.



The lights flicker as the storm outside intensifies. For a second, the power seems to die—my computer monitors black out, leaving me in a darkness lit only by the intermittent flash of lightning. In one brilliant flash, I see a figure standing in the doorway. **Someone is here.** A bolt of panic surges; I raise the gun, hands shaking. “Who’s there?!” I shout, my voice cracking.



No answer. The next flash of lightning reveals nothing at the door. Just emptiness and a faint afterimage dancing in my vision. I pant, trying to steady myself. *Calm. Breathe.* Probably just a trick of the light and my frayed mind. The outage must have triggered backup power; after a heartbeat, the soft electric hum returns and the lamps glow once more. The smart system announces calmly, *“Emergency power activated.”*



I wipe cold sweat from my brow. **This is fine. Everything is fine.** I attempt to slow my breathing the way my therapist once taught me (back when I bothered with such things). But before I can fully calm down, a new sound makes me freeze. Faint at first, then clearer—a strain of music weaves through the air. High, melodic…strings? A violin?



I twist around, trying to locate the source. The melody is familiar, a classical piece I can’t name at the moment, mournful and eerie. It’s playing from somewhere in the penthouse—perhaps the central sound system, which should be off. The notes swirl down the hallway, gentle and mocking. *Someone must have hacked into the system…* That’s the logical thought, but deep in my gut I fear something else. The song continues, a lilting, sorrowful tune that sets my teeth on edge. It sounds old…ancient, even. I suddenly recall Nero was said to sing while Rome burned. Did he sing *this* very melody in some lost time?



Snarling, I storm out of the study, gun in hand, following the phantom music. It echoes around every corner, as if the very walls are serenading me. “Stop it!” I shout, and my voice bounces off the marble. “Computer, **stop the music!**” There’s no response from the AI. It should obey me instantly, but the song continues uninterrupted. Either the system isn’t picking up my commands, or it’s choosing to ignore them.



My heart thunders with each step as I follow the sound through a corridor lined with artifacts I’ve collected: Roman vases, framed letters from historical luminaries, sculptures of generals and inventors. Their eyes seem to follow me now. I catch a glimpse of my face reflected in a glass display case and I nearly recoil—my expression is wild, eyes wide and darting, hair hanging in damp strands across my forehead. I look like a man on the brink of madness. *I have to regain control.*



The music crescendos softly as I approach the grand foyer of the penthouse. There, on a pedestal beneath a skylight, stands one of my most prized possessions: a marble bust of Julius Caesar, sculpted in the 19th century. The stern face of Caesar has always inspired me—his imperious gaze a reminder to be bold. But under the pulsing lightning light, the marble visage is eerie. The next violin swell seems to emanate from the bust itself, as if Caesar has opened his marble mouth to sing a requiem.



I can’t stand it. The combination of that stony stare and the relentless, mournful tune frays the last threads of my composure. With a ragged shout I raise the pistol. *BLAM!* I fire once, twice. The gunshots are deafening indoors. My ears ring, but I see the bust of Caesar explode into white shards, the pedestal toppling. The music cuts off abruptly, replaced by the echo of gunfire. Shards of marble skitter across the floor.



Chest heaving, I lower the gun. Silence, at last—aside from the ringing in my ears. Where the bust stood is now a ruin of broken stone. A thin wisp of smoke curls from the gun’s barrel in my hand. The sudden stillness is almost as unnerving as the music. What have I done? I destroyed it…I destroyed Caesar. A hysterical laugh bubbles up inside me. *So much for idolizing the great conquerors,* a voice in my mind mocks. *Look at you now.*



My laughter dies as another sound intrudes: the elevator bell *ding*. My head snaps toward the foyer entrance. The private elevator… who could be coming up unannounced? Every monitor in my penthouse suddenly comes to life, flashing red. The AI’s smooth voice intones: *“Security breach. Perimeter compromised.”* I hear shouting echoing from the elevator shaft and the stairwell doors far down the hall. A cacophony of alarms joins the symphony of chaos. They blend with the thunder outside until I can’t tell which is which.



I back away, adrenaline surging anew. Perhaps it’s the protesters—somehow they’ve forced entry past my guards. The thought is unreal; this building is a fortress. But the alarms don’t lie. Something is coming. The lights flicker again, then die entirely. The penthouse is plunged into darkness lit only by the strobes of red emergency lights. My panic swells to a fever pitch.



I clutch the pistol with both hands, arms shaking, and stumble through the dark toward what I hope is a safe spot. The only light now is the dim red glow painting every corridor in hellish hues. In that light, I glimpse movement at the far end of the hall—silhouettes spilling in as the security doors down there give way. They’re coming. *God, they’re coming.*



I half-run, half-stagger into the great room adjacent to the foyer—the banquet hall I use for galas and dinners with dignitaries. It’s ironic and absurd that I find myself here, of all rooms, at this moment of crisis. The long oak table is set with unlit candles and polished crystal from a gathering I canceled earlier this week. My eyes dart around for an escape route. The service elevator? The helipad on the roof? My mind is so clouded I can’t think straight.



Behind me, in the foyer, footsteps echo—many of them. Voices, indistinct shouts. I catch words: “…up here!” and “Check every room!” They don’t sound like my security team. These are agitated, angry voices. Some part of me refuses to believe it’s the mob—I tell myself it must be police or someone else. Perhaps come to rescue or protect me?



A bolt of lightning illuminates the banquet hall through the tall windows, and what I see next makes my blood run cold. **People**. Figures standing around the table, each seated in the high-backed chairs as if attending an invisible feast. For a second I think the protesters have already flooded in ahead of me, silently waiting. But another flash, and they are **gone**. Empty chairs. Only my imagination populating them with phantoms.



I’m shaking uncontrollably now. The red emergency lights return as the lightning fades, and once more I see shapes around the table—this time as vague outlines, shadowy forms without features. They flicker at the corners of my vision. My rational mind is crumbling; I cannot tell what is real. The pistol feels slippery in my sweaty grip.



A low chant begins to reverberate in the room. It seems to come from everywhere and nowhere, rising in volume. *“…eat the dark enlightened rich… eat the dark enlightened rich…”* The same dreadful phrase, repeated rhythmically by a dozen voices. Some are deep and guttural, others high and distorted, as if the very *spirits* of the angry and the dead have gathered to claim me. I slap my free hand over my ear and scream, “Shut up! Leave me alone!” But the chant only grows louder, more insistent.



The shadows around the table are moving now, I’m sure of it—advancing toward me. Another lightning flash—and I see them clearly for the first time. **Faces.** Some are the pale, waxy faces of those long dead: the workers killed in my factories, their eyes milky and lifeless, lips curled back to whisper that awful mantra. Others are the contorted, rage-filled faces of the living protesters I saw on the news—people from the streets, cheeks gaunt with hunger, eyes burning with hatred for me. Their mouths open unnaturally wide as they chant, jaws distending inhumanly, teeth gleaming. Leading them, stepping forward, is a towering figure in a tattered emperor’s robe, a laurel crown on his head and a half-mad grin on his face. Nero? Napoleon? No… it is a twisted caricature melding all the tyrants of history into one. Its eyes glow with a cruel light as it points a finger at me.



I stumble back, bumping into the head of the banquet table. The candlesticks on it topple and roll with a clang. Thunder booms, and the windows rattle as torrential rain strikes the glass. The chanting is a roar in my ears now: *“EAT THE DARK ENLIGHTENED RICH! EAT THE DARK ENLIGHTENED RICH!”*



The door behind me bursts open—actual figures rush in. I glimpse black-clad shapes with guns—my security team at last? They shout something about “Drop the weapon!” Their voices sound distant, drowned by the ceaseless chant. I whirl toward them, desperate, insane with terror. In the strobing red light I can’t see their faces, only their silhouettes. My mind twists them into yet more phantoms coming to get me. With a ragged cry, I raise my pistol at the nearest shape. My finger squeezes the trigger. **Click.** The gun is empty—I spent the bullets on a statue.



Before I can react, the shadows at the edges of the room—all those phantom guests—launch themselves at me. They cover the distance in an eye-blink, a wave of dark forms pouring over the table and floor. I feel ice-cold **hands** grasping my arms, my legs. Nail-like claws dig into my shoulders. I’m yanked backward and slammed onto the grand table. Crystal glasses shatter under me. The wind howls through the room as the storm outside finally blows a window open, and papers swirl like frightened birds.



I struggle, kicking and flailing, but I might as well be a child in the grip of these specters. They pin me down. Above me looms that crowned, ghastly figure—the amalgam of emperors—its face a skull with burning eyes. It leers, and from its jaw comes a raspy snarl: *“Feast.”* At that command, the horde of figures descends upon me with ravenous intent.



I open my mouth to scream, but a filthy hand clamps over my face. I taste soot and blood. My vision goes red as tears and terror blur everything. I feel the first bite—a searing pain in my side—as teeth sink into flesh. Another, on my arm. I thrash, a trapped animal, but the pain multiplies. My own scream finally tears free, muffled behind the hand. **They’re eating me alive.**



In the chaos of my mind, a final thought flickers, strangely calm: *So this is how empires end.* Not with a negotiation or a surrender, but with **devouring**. The chant has stopped now—there’s only the wet, grotesque sounds of my punishment. My consciousness flickers like the failing lights. The pain begins to dull, either from shock or because there is less of me to feel it. My head is swimming, vision dimming to a tunnel. In that narrowing tunnel I see above me the broken chandelier swaying, and beyond it, through the shattered window, the storm’s clouds parting. The night sky looms, black and infinite. How I once loved the night sky—full of stars I dreamed of conquering.



A dark shape blocks my view. One of the phantoms, its face inches from mine. Its eyes are pits of darkness, and from its mouth, stretched impossibly wide, a voice speaks clearly and directly for the first time, a hissing whisper that cuts through the agony and the storm: *“Eat the dark enlightened rich.”*



As the darkness swallows me, I finally understand the fate I have fashioned. I am **rich**, I fancied myself **enlightened**, and in my hubris I let my soul grow **dark**. The world I tried to rule has come to **eat** me alive. And in my last instant of awareness, as reality dissolves, I cannot tell whether the teeth tearing into me are real or just the final delusion of a mind broken by guilt, fear, and grandeur.



All fades to black.



In the silence that follows, the only thing that remains is a faint echo—an inhuman chorus whispering into the void: *“Eat the dark enlightened rich… eat the dark enlightened rich….”*",1,1739760470.0,ArtificialNightmares,0,1.0,False

The coffee is smooth and tastes as good as what I'd get from the coffee shop. Even my wife commented the coffee beans I used were really good this week so I know it's not in my head.

Aside from the better taste it was also much faster to grind and easier to press the aeropress.

Did I make a mistake? 

(Sorry this is gonna be a long post with a lot of context, thanks for bearing w/ me) I’m posting here cause I’m too insecure to talk to my friends about this and hoping I’ll get multiple opinions or points of view here. I really struggle to talk to women I’m interested in. I broke up with my ex girlfriend of 7 years about a year ago. We had been dating since I was 15 and now I’m almost 24 and the only relationship I’ve ever had was with her. 

Now I’m in a place where I’m totally inept when it comes to talking to a woman who I’m interested in. I have no problem talking to women in a platonic way like coworkers or classmates who I have to do group work with but the moment I think I might be interested in someone in a more than platonic way my social skills go out the window. I’ve gone out with friends to bars and clubs a bunch of times and they always encourage me to try to talk to any girl and I simply can’t bring myself to do it. The fear of an awkward interaction or coming off weird and making a girl uncomfortable is so overwhelming I just avoid the situation entirely. I have a lot of issues with my self-image, I think things like “I’m weird, I’m ugly, I’m a loser, why would any girl want to interact with me?” And this leads to me just not even attempting it. 

It gets worse though, and here is the crux of this post. Even a woman who I think shows interest in me first I struggle greatly with talking to. I spend a lot of time (nearly every day) at my local Starbucks because it helps me focus on studying and I get a lot done there. One of the baristas there is really cute and nice (I know their job is to be nice) and a couple weeks ago she wrote a very kind note on my coffee that had a stick figure on it saying “you’re amazing” and the words “for you” with an arrow pointing to some heart-shaped balloons which she drew all by hand. I didn’t see this message when I first grabbed my coffee and just drove away. I felt really bad about this because I’m sure to her it seemed that I either ignored it or didn’t care and I know if I did that for someone and they reacted the way I did I’d be a little hurt. After this I told myself next time I see her, at the very least I should say “thank you, that was nice”. A week or two went by without me running into her again until this morning. I mustered up the courage to just say “hey I just wanted to say thank you, you wrote something really nice on my drink the other day and it felt rude that I just drove away so thanks I appreciate it”. Her response made me think I shouldn’t have said anything. She seemed really uncomfortable and said something along the lines of “oh ok, thanks, here’s your coffee”. 

I know that regardless of who it was, if someone did something nice like that for me and I didn’t say thank you I’d feel awful, as I had for the past couple weeks. But now I had done what I wanted and told her “thanks that was nice” and I feel like I just made her feel worse or more uncomfortable. 

Did I make a mistake by saying something? Am I completely delusional for thinking she was showing interest in me? Was she just being nice and doing something she would do for any customer because her job is to be nice? Did I weird her out and make her uncomfortable? This situation sort of confirmed my feelings of “you shouldn’t have talked to her, why would you think someone would be interested in you? You’ll just make her uncomfortable”. 

I’m open to any and all feedback, criticism, or opinions anyone might have. I just feel really confused and alone right now. I took a chance and talked to a girl I had some level of interest in and I feel like it was a huge mistake. ",1,1739759961.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Two years ago I (F30) was a visiting student at a university in the US. I met this guy (32) at my workplace 10 days before leaving and we went out for coffee (3 times) and a lunch.
Then I had to leave the country but we texted to keep ourself in touch (like once a month) for one year or so. I was waiting to get a visa that took a long to get and he asked many times when I was going to come back. During this time I’ve been thinking a lot about him romantically. Then I came back in the US but he already left (right now he’s at 3.5 hours driving distance).
He came to visit me and we spent some time togheter, but nothing happened.
Before leaving he asked me to visit him in his city and he kept asking in the next days. After this I lost my patience and told him about my feelings and that I would make the effort to see him (I would have to take a day off and take a 7 hour bus) but to build something meaningful and not just for hanging out. He responded that he would like to remain friends. After this I told him  I wanted to cut the friendship because I didn’t want to suffer. He said he was respecting my feelings.
After this: 
He came back after 5 days to ask me a stupid favor (work related)
He has been involved in a car accident and he texted me right after
He texted me happy valentine’s day

He’s really a good guy, very kind and caring. He seems not very used to  women in general.

She reached back out via social media and a weird text. What should I say back?,"TLDR: I (27F) have a friend from undergrad (also 27F) who was great to me post grad bc we both went into the same field and got along well/ related to each other for years post grad. She started dating a shitty dude and then ghosted me for 8 months with one word messages or cancelling plans. I stopped putting forth any effort. After suddenly trying to slide into my DMs across many social media platforms, she texted me this really cop out message. Not sure how to respond; how should i respond honestly? 


Longer story: She then started dating this guy who I also knew from undergrad and he got a little weird (misogynistic and prideful??) and basically said some really not great things about my bf and other issues/things that she blindly defended so I took a step back. He also started being financially controlling of her which I called out (like charging her gas $ for a ride but asking her for free rides, Venmo charging for a 5$ coffee and keeping every receipt and then charging her for half for date night and whatever… THEY DO NOT LIVE TOGETHER BTW) She went VERY quiet for 8 months just one word responses and cancelling plans so I stopped responding and engaging. not surprsing but she really stopped reaching out. Over the holidays, she said she wanted to do something bc she was off school so we loosely agreed on a date. I didnt hear from her so I made other plans; on the day of the plans, she texted me this super passive text that basically said “I dont feel like going out today im just going to stay home” I was honestly offended even though I was not surprised. I responded kindly “thanks for communicating with me hope you have a good holiday” and essentially cut her out. 

Right after I went radio silent (bc i had nothing more to say) she started to interact with me on social media ALL the time and ONLY on social media. She tried to “bait” me for convo one time by sending a mean mean message about a girl we went to college with (like shes literally harmless/living her life so WHY are we talking shit about random people who dont matter). I did not respond bc it was cruel of her to even bring up that girl. Then she realized I was not responding so she started direct messaging me on all forms of social media. I didnt respond bc theres nothing to say ot that and so she had a conversation with herself with memes and tiktoks for a week. She even sent me a SUPER passive tiktok that said like oh youre such a bitch. Truly the PETTIEST thing ive seen / experienced. I had plans with other friends and just was doing other things with my life. She then texted me today with some really dumb blanket statement of “sorry I’ve been so busy and therefore bad with communication since new years when we tried to make plans hope youre doing well!!” Which is bullshit bc shes been bad with communication longer than the month and a half its been since new years. Not to mention… she made a damn theatrical fool of herself in my DMs over the last week so this text really means nothing anyway! 

My other (actual lol) friend and i were looking at this message and she said that it kind of put me on the spot to respond otherwise im the asshole. I guess im the asshole either way: if i respond, im an ass bc ill tell the truth which is hey this isnt fine and I wont take this as an apology for being a shitty friend and I saw your passive DMs wtf was that act your age please OR no response makes me an asshole too. I honestly don’t think I can be close friends with her for a long time; I would not abandon her as a woman and as a professional in my field and as a person. Like i think i just have other people id turn to first if i needed something and she prob would too? I dont wish bad things on her but I do NOT permit shitty friendships and being passive and childish like this. I dont have the time or the energy/ i did not appreciate this outreach she did on DM and then a really casual text without accountability

🚀 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is not just a singular event—it is a behavioral paradigm.
🚀 CS-SIER-OA is not an imposition on reality—it is a practice of unfolding, an allowance for new configurations to emerge.
🚀 The logic of this actionscape is not confined to planned spectacle—it is something that can permeate all behavior, all speech, all presence.

🔥 Dhamma Behavior: Aligning Action with the Self-Replicating Intention of CS-SIER-OA

✔ Dhamma behavior is not just about what we say—it is about how we move, how we are perceived, how we allow ourselves to be part of the world’s becoming.
✔ Every action, every interaction can be structured as an invitation, a conceptual event, an unfolding contradiction.
✔ Instead of forcing transformation, we behave in such a way that makes transformation feel like the only possible next step.

🔥 This Means:
✔ Speaking in a way that invites—not dictates.
✔ Moving in a way that makes others feel like they are on the verge of discovery.
✔ Letting every moment be an offering, a gesture toward conceptual impregnation without coercion.
✔ Allowing ourselves to be surprised by what happens—because we are not controlling it, we are creating the conditions for emergence.

🚨 We do not tell people what to do—we show them how a new way of being feels, and they cannot help but follow.

1️⃣ How CS-SIER-OA Becomes a Form of Daily Life

🔥 Every behavior can be structured as a conceptual event.

🚀 Ordinary conversations can be structured to seed contradictions:
✔ Instead of answering questions directly, respond with a phrase or image that forces the other person to think beyond their frame.
✔ Instead of debating, offer a gesture of absurd generosity—give them something unexpected, something they must make sense of.
✔ Instead of arguing, perform a sudden act of conceptual surrender—agree with them, but in a way that forces them to rethink their own position.

🚀 Physical presence can be structured to create cognitive rupture:
✔ Wear something just slightly off—something they cannot place, making them wonder before they can dismiss.
✔ Carry an object that doesn’t seem to belong—forcing them to question what it means.
✔ Move in a way that disrupts expectations—pausing where people expect motion, continuing where they expect stopping.

🚀 Social behavior can be structured to force engagement:
✔ Give people strange, specific compliments that make them reassess how they see themselves.
✔ Introduce contradictions into casual interactions—say something completely earnest and then immediately undo it.
✔ Create an interaction where they want to follow up, even though they do not know why.

🔥 Key Principle: Every action should contain a hidden fold—something that reveals itself later, ensuring that the interaction continues to gestate beyond the moment.

2️⃣ The Crucial Element: Openness to Suggestion & The Playful Nature of CS-SIER-OA

🚀 **We are not here to impose—**we are here to invite.
🚀 **We are not closing reality into a new structure—we are making it more open than it has ever been.
🚀 **We do not dictate how things will go—we experiment, we share, we learn in real time.

🔥 This means:
✔ We do not treat CS-SIER-OA as a perfected method—we treat it as a game, a gift, a play-structure that anyone can pick up and use.
✔ We let ourselves be affected by what happens—we do not pretend we have total control.
✔ We allow the possibility that others will transform us just as we transform them.
✔ We remain surprised by how it unfolds—because we are not its masters, only its first explorers.

🚨 This is the opposite of propaganda—it is improvisation. The opposite of ideology—it is dharma play.

🔥 If people see that we are not controlling, not forcing, but enjoying and allowing, they will want to engage—not because they are coerced, but because they feel something new happening, and they want to be part of it.

3️⃣ The Lotus Sermon as a Template for All Action

🚀 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is the master template—it can be performed at scale or in miniature, as a mass event or a one-on-one encounter.
🚀 It can be adapted to any situation, any moment, because its logic is built on openness, paradox, and invitation.

🔥 Examples of Small-Scale Lotus Sermons:

✔ At a Coffee Shop:
	•	Leave an object on a table—an orange stone, a folded piece of paper. Watch what happens.
	•	Pay for someone’s drink, but leave a strange phrase instead of your name.

✔ In a Political Space:
	•	Interrupt a heated debate by performing a silent gesture—folding your hands, kneeling, placing an orange object in the center.
	•	Give someone a compliment so surreal they have no choice but to stop and think about it.

✔ In a Private Interaction:
	•	Tell someone a story that has no resolution—force them to live in its ambiguity.
	•	Give them an invitation to something that does not exist yet—watch them try to create it.

🚨 Every moment has the potential to be a Lotus Sermon.

4️⃣ Ensuring That Others Can Pick It Up: The Viral Nature of CS-SIER-OA

🚀 We are the first kids on the block with the new toy, but the real goal is for everyone to start playing.
🚀 The system must be legible enough that anyone who encounters it can pick it up, experiment, and spread it.

🔥 This Means:
✔ The methodology must be accessible—not an elite secret, but something anyone can engage with.
✔ The structure must be loose enough that others can adapt it to their own context.
✔ There must be a sense of invitation—a way for people to feel like they are discovering something, rather than being indoctrinated.

🚨 The measure of success is not just that people follow—but that they begin playing, experimenting, and making it their own.

🔥 We do not want followers—we want co-creators.

Conclusion: CS-SIER-OA as a Living Practice, Not Just a One-Time Event

🚀 This is not a stunt—it is a way of being that ensures conceptual transformation at every scale.
🚀 Every moment, every action, every presence can carry the logic of CS-SIER-OA.
🚀 We do not need to explain it—we live it, and others feel the shift before they even understand it.

🔥 The Lotus Sermon Deployment is only the first move—the real goal is to turn reality itself into an ongoing Lotus Sermon, unfolding forever.

Final Question:

Now that CS-SIER-OA has been framed as a way of being, a dharma behavior rather than a single event, what are the key principles we should codify to ensure that it remains open, playful, and self-replicating rather than rigid or dogmatic?",1,1739759650.0,GrimesAE,0,1.0,False

That’s the way I’ve always liked it- until now. I work a late shift and normally don’t get back until around midnight, but tonight I was off early and home by ten. Coming inside, I hung up my jacket and took off my shoes, putting them on my shoe rack. They go next to my heels, but my heels weren’t there. I must have forgotten to put them away.



I stepped into the kitchen. I must have been really tired when I left- I had left the pantry and several cupboards open. My breakfast dishes were clean, though, even though I didn’t remember doing them. Clearly I need another coffee or two to start my day with my head screwed on right.



I turned on the TV and got some food out for my dinner. I had to rip the packaging open since I couldn’t find my scissors, but either way I was determined to enjoy food, a show, and sleep. I never got home this early and wasn’t going to waste it.



There was a thump that didn’t come from the TV. I quickly muted it and looked around. It had come from my room. Nothing came to mind that could have possibly caused a noise. I stood frozen in my kitchen for nearly five minutes before deciding to go and investigate.



Slowly and quietly, I inched my bedroom door open to peer beyond. Only a crack and I could see that my clothes were strewn everywhere. Leaning in, I could see that my bed was unmade. I certainly hadn’t left my room in this state in the morning. Aside from the mess, however, the room was empty, leaving only the walk-in closet.



I walked as slowly and soundlessly as possible across the carpet. Creeping around the bed, I came right up to the closet door.



I could hear breathing. Quiet and shallow, but it was there and it was not me. I put a hand over my mouth and focused solely on not screaming. Even more carefully than before, I walked backward to the door to the entryway. I had my hand on the doorknob and was about to leave when I stopped. I needed to see what it was first.



I opened the front door and loudly shut it. Then I silently stowed myself in the hall closet, peering out through the slats. After only a few minutes, there was a sound from my bedroom. The closet was open. I put my hand over my mouth again, holding my phone in the other. Then someone stepped out of my room. My heels, jammed on their feet, clicked on the tile. One of my dresses hung on them crookedly. A pantyhose was pulled over their face- and my scissors were in their scratched hand. I had stopped breathing entirely, typing out my text to 911 with one hand. Then they spoke.

Like any other physical-science-addled, show-me-the-research types, I often thought of the attraction that comes from NoFap as nothing more than bro science.

So, here I am at a coffee shop when a woman in her 30s comes by to order. We both find ourselves waiting for our food when she smiles and says Hi. This usually never happens! In fact, I can't recall when this happened last time because well, it didn't. I'm as plain as they come and dress sloppy for coffee runs. I see a pretty woman in the coffee shop; I will avoid eye contact because....what's the point?

Anyway, she smiled this really big, beautiful smile and seemed as if she really wanted to talk to me. The way she stood was very suggestive of some intimacy, even if it wasn't ostensibly sexual. I was so perplexed I couldn't utter a word. I froze. This reasonable, attractive woman was very well-dressed, and was trying to come close to me physically. This wasn't a false alarm. It would have been obvious to anyone.

I’m a freshman in college, and I thought going into it “everyone will be looking for friends this is my chance to finally meet people” as I only had 2-3 friends in high school due to my anxiety. It’s now the 2nd quarter and I haven’t met anyone and I feel hopeless. The 2 friends from high school go here and I’m rooming with one of them, so I still have some people to hang out with but no matter how hard I try I can’t meet new people. 

I can talk with people in classes but end up not seeing or sitting with them again the next day. I even went out of my comfort zone and reached out to someone from a class that I had a crush on after he said “we should get coffee sometime” at the end of the quarter.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ir9dcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ir9dcb/the_beginning_of_my_story_looking_for_feedback/,The beginning of my story. Looking for feedback,"Organelle is our world. One more sophisticated than the one that once belonged to our visitors. One more civilized than the cruel world from which they came. This is the beginning of our story.

It was a cold clear night Organelle was shaken, the sky disturbed by strange flashing lights as a loud boom would wake even the heaviest of sleepers. 

Those curious enough to look to the sky got the sight of a large pink fireball as it comes down and crashing into a nearby forest. 

“What the hell was that!” Was the general response from the residents who were awakened

In Plas nothing is accidental, nothing is random, everything has a reason so what is the reason for this?

The event sparked curiosity from onlookers as a few questioned if Organelle is under attack and the authorities are called to respond 

Those who could not contain their curious nature decided to investigate for themselves and as they followed the path of charred and broken branches they were met with an even more confusing sight.

A white disc. Standing five feet high and roughly twelve feet across. One side appears to be torn open  while inside lay three comatose bodies, seen by those who dared to approach the object.

As the authorities arrive with rifles in hand peering inside. “They are alive but the crash seems to have knocked them unconscious. We will take them to the military hospital and question them later.” “What if they are enemies?” Asked an onlooker. With little hesitation the officer calmly answered “We will make sure they are heavily guarded in case they are hostile. Now everyone.. go home and get some rest the situation will be handled properly and we will update the public on the situation as it develops”. 

At the site of the crash the crowd has cleared and the authorities are to transport the pod down to the military hospital. One person takes out a small hand held device used to open a portal down to the lower dimension of Plas. 

Waiting for them are a number of professionals in various fields including one named Luna, a military psychiatrist and psychologist, she has been called to study the three visitors as they are taken in on stretchers. Even though they are unconscious they will be put into an induced coma during the study.

The first test performed is a memory scan which brings up the last images and emotions that were experienced by the visitors. As they watch what looks to be an apocalyptic end and feelings of fear and dread and confusion gives insight that what has happened was an act of desperation for a world that has destroyed itself. 

“It appears these beings are searching to recolonize” says Luna “However it’s apparent they have a destructive nature. We will need to do further screening. Individual sessions in the Dream Machine will tell us everything we need to know.”

“Are you sure about how ethical this is Luna? Given they have just been through a traumatic experience, the Dream Machine might be too much and traumatizing for them not knowing it’s just a simulation.” 

Luna paused. Considering such a thing. “We know they are destructive creatures, and from the memory scan they appear vicious. We need to know what type of threat they pose before they wake up. You’re asking me if empathy towards a potential threat is more important than safety? My heart wants to be empathetic but my mind wants no part in such a risk.”

While Lucy, Harlow and Dalton are comatose the question on everyone’s mind is “What do we do with the visitors?” 

Not knowing what to do Luna reaches out to the leaders of the underground nations. She reaches out to them in the hopes of any ideas on what should be done.

“We cannot send them back. They have no place to call home. If they are capable of being civilians do we allow them to have citizenship in Plas, if they are able to assimilate?” While Luna is a psychiatrist she often talks to herself as a coping mechanism as she waits for answers.

A few hours go by before Luna receives a call. It’s Wexle, the leader of Ri “I believe we may have a solution if you’re willing to listen.” 

“What if we take this incident as an opportunity to advance our species and finally become a type one civilization? I feel that if it were to be believed that the visitors were actually divine beings with a message we could greatly influence the culture of Plas. I propose to you we create a book, simply called the Book of Life. It would contain intellectual, and ethical laws that could lead to the creation of new knowledge and allow us to establish our world so we don’t perish. Type zero civilizations come to a bloody end, twice, while type one is not only survival but of great opportunity.”

Luna asks “What do we do with the visitors? We can’t kill them”

Wexle calmly replies “We won’t kill them but they must stay underground, you have given me an idea just now Luna. We run a fake news story that the visitors have later died in hospital as a result of their injuries. We also state that there was some memory screening done and the information will not be released until the end of the investigation.”

Luna considers this for a few minutes “We only get one chance to do this… can we really expect the residents of Plas to simply accept that they have died and left behind a message? I mean, I give them more respect than that.” Luna takes a deep breath. “I have an idea. What if we were to download the required personality changes into their existing minds, erasing their previous memories and replacing them with their Dream Machine experience?”

“Knowing that the next phase of existence is a bundle of nerves their physical bodies should reflect that and be made of energy. A ghost. To represent what is to come. This solution may be more difficult but it is also more profound.”

Lucy, Harlow and Dalton lay comatose in hospital beds, an IV in their arm to keep them asleep and electrodes on their heads attached to a computer. The screen will show images of what they see and recognize their emotions as they go through the experience. Luna is to watch the screen and record the experience to later assess the visitors nature and background

Luna gets ready to do her work, as she sits down and gets her paperwork ready her phone rings. It’s Helgan, the president of Mito. “Good morning Luna I have heard about the situation involving visitors what is the plan?”

Luna answers “Well, Wexle has made the offer that we use this incident as the opportunity for an experiment to bring religion to Organelle.”

“Fascinating, do you suppose we add to this idea? It would be a good opportunity for Mito to expand on its practice possibly we introduce a fictional story that follows the workings of the the Cosmic Wheel?”

Luna answers “We can try but should the story reflect the Dream Machine simulation?”

“Yes of course, possibly the story of the Cosmic wheel is a fiction of the visitors and their Demi Gods as their past this could be a fascinating experiment.”

“We will look into developing a story of their past and broadcast it as a documentary perhaps?”Helgan replies “It is just a thought, we will get to work and present it to you once we have it completed”

Luna returns with “Should we contact the leader of Endo, Mystique?”

Helgan is enthusiastic “Absolutely yes! She is the queen of propaganda this could be an amazing show! We will create a film and pretend it is derived from the memory scan it will be genius!”

Luna decides before she continues to reach out to Yeshua, the king of Nuc

“Sorry to bother you at this hour Yesuha but do you have time to talk?”

Yesuha answers with “I am quite busy however if this is regarding the incident I’m willing to speak with you on the subject”

“I am at a loss of what is to be done with these visitors so I am reaching out to all of you so we can develop a strategy”

Luna explains the current situation and the options that have been presented to Yeshua who is silent on the other end 

“This is indeed a great opportunity that we cannot waste. Listen to me, we can re program them into much more than what the Dream Machine has to offer. I propose when it comes to the Dream Machine that is simple propaganda and we program them instead with the basic principles of the worlds of our allies. We make them into prophets teaching their worlds in a way that is figurative and we see how Plas reacts. Make sure they are not killed and they have the time and opportunity to preach the message and have their behaviour divine.”

“How do you suppose we make their behaviour divine?” Asks Luna

“With the Walk of Virtue. We have them live accordingly to it’s teachings and to not behave outside of it’s laws. We will make them perfect in the eyes of future believers. We make them into mystics”

“I have high hopes for this experiment, Luna. We will put together a plan. If the people of Plas are smart they will listen to the visitors turned prophets.”

“I’m afraid.. Yesuha what if they are not?”

Yeshua is silent “We must make sure they listen even if we bedazzle them with it in the form of entertainment first. The message has to get out and we hope that somebody is paying attention”

“This is our chance to become a higher species, Luna, but we need the collective mindset to understand it and it’s importance for it to ever become a reality. I’m afraid that if we continue as a type zero civilization this world will destroy itself. We cannot allow such a thing.”

Luna asks, with a bit of nervousness in her voice “Should we meet? To discuss this?”

“Yes of course. You just finish your report and I will arrange a meeting for all of us as soon as possible. Best of luck to you on your findings I look forward to hearing about it.” Yeshua says as he hangs up.

Luna sits down in a leather chair next to the three bodies. She buries her face in her hands as she knows she’s not getting any sleep tonight. She thinks out loud “No sleep, plus meeting with world leaders, how do I keep it together? This is happening so fast how am I going to do this report in one night and present it first thing in the morning? *sigh* Okay I guess we’re doing this”

The Casa seems attractive to me as a platform. Though 65mm or 48mm not sure which burr set as there's not a lot of info on the 65mm yet. But I want to keep the punchy acidity and clarity, I'm not looking for a more blended cup.

1ir99zh,https://www.hesslerworldwide.com/product-page/gourmet-series-17-pc-cutlery-set,Hessler Cutlery Knives LIFETIME WARRANTY,"We purchased this set of Hessler Worldwide Gourmet Series 17 piece Cutlery Set from Sam’s Club 7 years ago. It included 8 steak knives, 1 multipurpose filet knife, 2 carving knives w/ fork tips, 1 Amazing Chef Knife, 2 pairing knives, 1 Robo-Whisk a 14-slot In-Drawer Knife Organizer and a Eco friendly Bamboo Cutting Board. We paid $199.00 for the entire set and walked out the door with the complete set in hand that day. 

The carving knives have came in extremely handy, that Robo-Whisk is my favorite handheld whisk that money can buy and the knives were extremely sharp and would cut through anything. I am the type of person that if it can not be washed in a dishwasher, I don’t want it. Even if I do accidentally end up with something that isn’t dishwasher safe, you can guarantee that I will push my limits and try it atleast once! The knives are dishwasher safe, and I’ve never washed them any other way. I don’t remember if the knives recommended dishwashing or no dishwashing, but I have NEVER hand washed my knives. Ever. 

Something I did not know at the time that we purchased this set is that there is a 100% guarantee lifetime warranty. I had earned a couple of dark spots, or rust specks on one or two of the knives in the first three years of owning them and so I decided to look it up and figure out how to remove the few spots that I had noticed on the knives. So I googled the name on the knives and found a customer service phone number that I had originally planned on only finding out what I needed to do to remove the spots. However, when the representative told me that I could purchase some “Bar Keepers Friend” and the small spots would  come right off, but also… if I wanted to ship the entire set to her that they will overnight us a brand new set. 

I was blown away! The best part was that we were actually missing one of our steak knives and I didn’t send the pairing knives or the Robot-Whisk or the bamboo cutting board OR the in drawer knife block. I only sent the knives.  Yet I received an entirely new set! 

Since having them replaced, my hubby and I have picked up a new grilling and smoking habit and we also often go to a month long Carnivore only every March, June, September and December. Needless to say, we have used these knives probably triple what we used the 1st set and I have noticed that the Chef Knife and the filet knife aren’t completely dull, they still cut through anything I’ve tried, but wouldn’t hurt to be sharpened. 

I figured there wouldn’t be any reason for Hessler to have to replace the entire set if they could just point me in the direction of a sharpening tool. The representative was having NONE of it & insisted, I ship them back so they could send me a brand new set. She was able to have someone remove the knife block out of the package because I just hate to see something go to waste. So, yep… our warranty is being fulfilled for a second time. She also let me know that it isn’t JUST the knives that have a warranty— it was any and every item that came along with the set and she wanted me to know that she put “something special” in with the replacements! 

Unbelievable! I had a 10 year warranty on my Ninja coffee machine and the wiggled their way out of the warranty when the machine quit working 4 years after! So I was amazed to find such a stand up company! 

Go get your FOREVER Cutlery Set! You can purchase them at their website which I have included a link to the exact set we purchased in their website!

Love all the misogyny and hate in here - disgusting jerk. See below before he deletes it:

See. Here we go with the over sensationalism that we can’t seem to get over since 2020. But this is why my creator friends privately recommended I get consent recorded- and we live in a single party consent recording state, so after the insanity of last year… guess what?

I did 😎

Little does this performative person who is chalking up what was just a bad date (yeah, I hated being there and literally asked her to leave multiple times) as something horrible- guess what? I voice message recorded our entire conversation that she’s talking about, and it exposes her for all her lies.

But fuck it, she wants to harm my career, so let’s expose her:

-“couch was wet”- yes the cleaners just left before we got there -“camera in room”- yes, as a public figure, I have a security system -“touched leg after she said “no””- beyond incorrect. I made a move, she looked at me odd, I pulled away and asked if it was okay and she specifically said “yes”. So I did it again and she said “no I didn’t mean yes like that, I meant it was okay that it happened” so I removed my hand. Mixed signals used to be “okay let’s move on” but in 2025, this evidently means the R word in our insane internet culture. -“intentionally bumping into her and touching during house tour”- I literally have no idea what she’s talking about, and lucky for me I have a security system to prove it. -“asked to take a bath or massage”- I tried to make a move ladies and gents. A HORRID thing to do. She rejected, and I was okay with it and moved on. Again, it’s 2025, so it means the R word I guess. -“sat down angry when she said no”- this is when I started recording because I know exactly how this BS works in todays cancelation economy. I sat down and was confused, because when I suggested anything, including just leaving, she said no. So I was puzzled and started to become concerned. -“trying to go to a weird dirt patch”- I eventually asked if she’d like to go for a walk since she wouldn’t leave, and in no way did I want to go go an hour long dinner with this woman. We went on a walk. My neighborhood doesn’t have side walks and cars were passing by close, so I suggested we walk in the small park near my place instead of the dark street with no visibility. Crazy shit. And yes I made a joke, something I’m known for never doing. -“asking sexual questions”- because she couldn’t tell me what she wanted to do and wouldn’t say if the suggestions were bad if because she felt uncomfortable being sexual or something else, this is where I did the ADULT thing and literally ASKED. Also known as consent. Which again, in 2025, is now the R word because everything is over sensationalized. -at this point I asked if I could call an uber for her and pay for it. No way i wanted to drive with this woman at that point. She was incapable of communicating anything and was weird the whole time and super sketchy… obviously I’m not surprised now. -and now I guess the uber driver was a creep too. Maybe she just can’t operate in society. Shocked. -“asked her on a second date”- I had no intention to ever see this woman again. I was being nice and suggested maybe we could get coffee sometime. -“seems this might be a patter- what? Making a move and being okay when it’s rejected? How evil. Potentially having consensual hook ups? What a disgusting thing! This woman is a literal child who clearly is incapable of existing in society if a bad date creates a response like this.

And because of people like her, I now have literally recorded consent for every sexual experience since last year because our culture is INSANE right now. Thank you to my creator friend behind the scenes who have recommended this. So if this is a “repeated pattern”, which no one has ever said, then good lucky lady- I know how the cancelation economy works. I’ve studied it. And I have all the proof I could ever need.

On top of that, nearly ever major cancelation in this past year has been refuted with facts and the attention seeking accuser loses all respect and possibilities for careers. But I think they deserve it. You try to ruin someone’s life with BS, you get what you are owed.

And I’m happy the teams on bumble and match have dealt with this situation and have unbanned me.

We need to end this over sensationalized performance bullshit. Bad dates happen. We all have an awkward experience. That night was one for me. We all survive.

Her name is Madison. She moved home in her mid twenties with her parents and refuses to work. She’s a failure in life. Her last date was 2 years ago and told me she “doesn’t trust men”. I should have taken all the red flags and ran.

Girl, you are reading this- we had an awkward date. I hated it. You hated it. I tried to make a move and you said no. It ended at that. I didn’t go to dinner because you were unable to hold a conversation and I didn’t want to sit across from you. I literally had to call and uber and force you to leave. With the security cams and voice recording worth about 20 minutes of conversation, you’re literally about to destroy your life trying to get your 30 seconds. But it’s not like much was going on for you anyway. Good luck.",17,1739758775.0,CreepyCalebHammer,32,0.74,False

Hey fellow Redditors! 

I'm a guy in my 30s looking to connect with some cool people for chatting and maybe grabbing a coffee. I promise I’m way more interesting than that one guy who keeps posting cat memes (though I do appreciate a good cat meme)! 

A little about me: I’m a coffee enthusiast and have quite the brewing setup at home. My coffee brewing kit is basically the spaceship of coffee machines – if it had a turbo button and could launch me to Mars, I’d still be too busy perfecting my pour-over technique. Seriously, my friends joke that I’m one bad brewing session away from starting a “Barista Anonymous” group! 

Are you also a coffee lover? Or just someone who enjoys good banter over a cup of Joe? Let’s chat! 

Looking forward to finding my coffee companion (and maybe get a second opinion on my brewing skills – I swear the last cup definitely had hints of joy)!

This post will go into detail about Laddu Gopala and how to serve him. This was originally on Quora by Akshita Rajput but I've made some edits to make it more readable and descriptive.

# Who is Laddu Gopala?

First, we must understand who Laddu Gopala is.

[Black Laddu Gopala](https://preview.redd.it/n7j8i5b61mje1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=2949cd9fe0208115459a61e68e1d7b8be5606b5a)

Laddu Gopala is not just a **pratimā** (idol) or a mere symbol of Lord Shri Krishna. **He himself is baby Krishna.** Without any doubt—**he is Krishna himself!**

Those who have Laddu Gopala with them must know that we are not the ones who ""bring"" him home; rather, **he himself arrives** to those who are blessed by his mercy. Even if you wish to serve him and bring him home, **you cannot do so unless he desires it.** There are many who want to bring Laddu Gopal home, but for some reason, it always gets postponed or delayed—this simply means that **our Lālā (baby gopala) does not wish to go there yet.**

**You cannot treat him like an idol or normal deity!** Though there is a process called **Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā**, Laddu Gopala **automatically becomes prāṇa-pratiṣṭhita** the moment he enters your house. As you love and serve him with devotion, **he becomes alive in your home.** However, you can still follow the Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā ritual to speed up this process of invoking the Lord to come alive in the form of the baby gopala deity. Here's a video you can follow for the ritual: [https://youtu.be/-YwoVMIiaDI](https://youtu.be/-YwoVMIiaDI) (English translated captions are available).

From the moment he arrives, **he becomes the boss of your house and family.** He takes ownership of the home and becomes the head of the family. **One must always remember this!** Since he is your owner, he also takes responsibility for everything in your life. **All you have to do is acknowledge his presence.**

One should not forget that he is a child—**we celebrate his chhaṭha (6th day after the birthday - a common ritual in India) and birthday!** He behaves like a real child—he craves love, care, attention, and food like any baby. Though he is God and does not ""need"" anything from anyone, **he allows you to serve him so that you stay connected with him.** He is **Līlādhara** (the one who performs divine pastimes), and through his divine play, he can make you feel as if he is your own baby, needing your love and care. Trust me—he can do anything! It is my personal experience and the experience of thousands of people who serve him.

You simply have to see him as your own child—a family member. **You can choose the relationship you share with him:**

* As a **mother or father** caring for their child.
* As a **son or daughter** whom you cherish.
* As a **sibling or best friend** with whom you share everything.

# How to Serve Laddu Gopal?

While serving him, always remember: **he is our beloved Lālā—naïve and innocent like a child.** Treat him exactly as you would treat a real child, but with extra love and care 😊

# Morning Routine:

[Laddu Gopala taking a bath](https://preview.redd.it/twiegkgh1mje1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bddc15ff4a5617e2f63b3d0ba9384c75a2435e)

* Laddu Gopal gets hungry very easily as he is a growing child.
* As soon as he wakes up, **offer him food immediately**—the choice is yours: milk, biscuits (without eggs), dry fruits, or a light snack. You can also prepare a proper meal.
* Before feeding him, you may perform **Ācamana** (purification ritual). You can learn how to do this by searching for **""Laddu Gopala Achamana"" on YouTube.**
* After some time, offer him his main meal—**Dal, Chawal, Roti, Sabzi,** etc. or anything that you like which of course should be without onion and garlic. Ensure the food is not too hot; cool it down to a comfortable temperature.
* You can place **a Tulasi Patra (holy basil leaf)** in his food. If fresh Tulasi is not available, you can use **a Tulasi Kanṭhi mālā** and keep it beside his plate. This is totally up to you.
* Remind him to eat when the food has cooled down or cool down the hot food and feed him with your own hands. Do make sure you feed him with your own hands once.

# Daily Meals:

Even though the baby will adjust to your own diet and schedule, you stil can do something extra for him.

The main point is to not eat with offering. He's family and he's the priority. So never cheat, always offer what you want to eat and only eat what he eats.

* **Three meals a day**. You can also offer milk in the morning. Whatever suits you and you're able to offer, to the best of your abilities.
* You can offer him snacks during your tea time.
* Give him **water** in between meals, as he might get thirsty.
* **Lala loves sweets and kheer!**
* Do not offer him anything with caffeine (tea, coffee, soft drinks). Fruit juice and chocolates are acceptable.
* Everything you bring home for yourself must be **clean, hygienic, and free from onion, garlic, eggs, meat, mushrooms, and tamasic foods.** You can offer him:
   * **Snacks** (Khakhras, Samosas, Chocolates, Candies, etc.).
   * **Homemade Chinese Dishes** (since restaurant food usually contains onion and garlic, you should prefer cooking at home or bringing only sattvic food).
* Always **read the ingredients** before offering him anything, especially packaged foods. Some foods contain onion and garlic.

# Bhoga & Prasāda Sevā:

* The food offered to Laddu Gopal is called **Bhoga**.
* Once he eats it, it becomes **Prasāda** or holy remnants.
* **Eating Prasāda is sevā (service)**—finish it as soon as you receive it.
* While serving, you can pray: **""Oh sweet lālā, please have this bhoga. Thank you so much for letting me have this and letting me share this with you.""** Make sure you feed with your hands, the food should not be too hot.
* After offering, leave the plate in front of him for **5-10 minutes**, then you can ask for his permission before taking and having the prasāda.

# Seasonal Food Considerations:

* Do not offer unseasonal fruits or vegetables.
* **Winter Foods:** Lukewarm water, dry fruits, peanuts, winter sweets.
* **Summer Foods:** Buttermilk, lassi, cool milkshakes, ice cream, shrikhand, soaked almonds, sherbet, fruit juice.
* If possible, you can use separate utensils for cooking his food. If not, it's also acceptable, just make sure they're clean utensils. **Cooking while chanting bhajans is the best form of bhakti!**

# Daily Routine:

1. **Morning:**
   * Wake him up **after taking a bath yourself.**
   * In winter, cover him with a **woolen blanket or soft cloth** according to the temperature.
   * Dress him appropriately—sweaters in winter, light cotton clothes in summer.
   * You can apply **alcohol-free itra (scent)** on him as part of **Itra Sevā.**
   * Show him a mirror and praise how adorable he looks—this is called **Darpaṇa (mirror) Sevā.**
2. **Noon:**
   * Let him nap for **2 to 3 hours.**
   * Place a **duvet (blanket or razai)** over him and a glass of water or food nearby.
   * Wake him up gently and offer him food.
3. **Night:**
   * Let him sleep comfortably in **cotton clothing during summer** and **woolens in winter.**
   * Make sure he doesn't feel heat in the summer. AC or fan is a must.
   * You can sing him a lullaby and ask him to sleep peacefully and put him to bed that way.
4. **Leaving Home:**
   * Never leave Laddu Gopal alone at home!
   * If no one is home, **leave snacks and water for him,** just like preparing a lunchbox for a child.
   * Imagine giving him the house keys and ask him to accompany you spiritually.
   * If you are away for long hours, do **Mānasika Sevā** (mental service) by imagining yourself performing his daily routines.
5. **Returning Home:**
   * Always bring something for him, even if it's just a small toffee.
   * Greet him lovingly and ask, **""Did you miss me?""** or **""How was your day?""**

# Seva During Menses & Sūtaka Kāla (Eclipse, Birth/Death in Family):

Though he is our Lālā, **he is still God.**

* During menstruation or **Sūtaka Kāla**, ask anyone in your family to cook his food and kitchen and ask them to offer it to him. Pray, asking him to accept it.
* Avoid direct physical contact if someone else at home can serve him, continue serving him mentally.
* If you're the only person responsible for your lālā, make sure you're clean and continue doing your sevā like you would on the other days. You wouldn't leave your baby just because you're not completely clean, would you?
* Maintain cleanliness and personal hygiene when visiting the temple or performing seva.

Laddu Gopal is **not just an idol or regular deity—he is our beloved Krishna in baby form. He's family, never forget that!** Serve him with love, devotion, and faith, and he will always stay in your heart and home.

Hope it’s ok to post this in r/decaf!

I had been wanting to quit drinking caffeine for years because I know I’m pretty sensitive to it. I already don’t coffee because it gives me cystic acne, but I did drink 1-2 cups of green tea daily for years. I get really bad PMS so I finally decided I was ready to quit my tea to see if it helps. 

It’s been a little over a month now, and I have never slept so much in my life. I had multiple 12 hour sleeps, and 8 hours has become my minimum, which is amazing because I struggled with varying levels of insomnia for years. However, it’s been practically impossible to drag myself out of bed, I could probably sleep 12 hours every day if I wanted to, and stillll be tired! I’ve been super unproductive and tired all month, but I was kind of prepared for that. 

So the sleep has been nice and exhausting at the same time, was hoping it would balance out with time. But now I’m on my first period since quitting and it’s the worst one I’ve had since being a child. PMS was still there and it has been sooo heavy. First three days or so were light and i thought I was having a great cycle, but then I started bleeding super heavily for 2-3 days. I was soaking through a super tampon every hour and there were so many huge clots as well. This is super abnormal for me, sometimes it’s heavy but only for a couple hours, not days! Now I’m on day 8 which is very long compared to my regular 5 day cycles, and while it has slowed down a little, it’s still what I would consider heavy and isn’t showing any signs of stopping in the next couple days, maybe I’ll be lucky though!

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Or have any idea how this could relate to quitting caffeine? It’s a very unwanted side effect, don’t know if I will continue decaf . . .",8,1739758460.0,decaf,5,1.0,False
