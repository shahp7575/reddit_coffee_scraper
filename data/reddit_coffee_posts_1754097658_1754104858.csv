##‚Å£ Key Features Analysis

The ‚ÄãCopper Apron Farmhouse Sink offers ‚Äçseveral noteworthy features that contribute to its overall ‚Å£performance and user experience.

**Gauge of Copper:** the sink ‚Å£boasts a 16-gauge copper construction, ensuring extraordinary durability and resistance to dents and scratches.

Sixteen-gauge copper‚Å§ is significantly‚Å§ thicker than 18-gauge or ‚Å¢20-gauge copper,‚Äã providing‚Äå a more robust and long-lasting sink. this thickness helps to distribute weight evenly, preventing warping or bending over time. The ‚Å£heavier gauge also contributes ‚Äåto a quieter‚Äå operation,‚Äç reducing the noise of running water and ‚Äçclattering‚Å§ dishes.

**Hand-Hammered ‚ÄãTexture:** The sink's surface features a meticulously hand-hammered texture, ‚Äåadding visual depth and a unique aesthetic appeal.

This texture isn't just ‚Äãfor looks; it also helps to mask minor scratches and water spots,maintaining the sink's‚Å¢ beauty over time. Each‚Å£ sink is individually crafted, ensuring that no two sinks are exactly alike.‚Äã The hand-hammering process also strengthens the copper, making it ‚Å§more resistant to the effects of daily ‚Å¢use.

**Apron Front‚Äç Design:** The sink sports‚Å£ a ‚Å¢prominent apron front, extending slightly ‚Å£beyond ‚Å£the cabinet face for a distinctive farmhouse look.

The apron front, also known as a farmhouse design, is a hallmark of this‚Äã type of sink.‚Å¢ It ‚Å§not‚Äã onyl enhances the visual appeal but also offers practical benefits. The extended‚Å§ front allows for closer access to the sink, reducing ‚Äçstrain‚Å§ on the back and shoulders ‚Äçduring tasks like washing dishes or prepping‚Äã food.

**Protective‚Å£ Coating:** A durable protective coating is applied to the copper, ‚Å£preventing oxidation and preserving the sink's natural color and luster.

This coating is‚Å¢ crucial for maintaining the sink's appearance, as untreated ‚Å§copper will naturally develop a patina over time. The‚Å£ coating creates‚Äç a barrier against‚Äå moisture and other environmental factors, preventing the copper from oxidizing and changing color. This ensures that the sink ‚Äçretains ‚Äãits original beauty for years to come with minimal maintenance.

**Sound Dampening Pads:** Strategically placed sound dampening‚Äå pads minimize noise from‚Å£ dishwashing and garbage disposal use.

These pads ‚Äåare typically attached to ‚Å§the underside of the sink basin, absorbing‚Äå vibrations and ‚Äåreducing the sound of water hitting the copper surface. This ‚Å§feature is‚Å§ especially ‚Å£vital in ‚Å£open-concept kitchens, where noise can easily travel throughout the‚Å§ space. The ‚Å£sound dampening pads help to create a more peaceful and enjoyable kitchen ‚Å§environment.

**Optional Grid Drain:** The‚Å¢ sink is available with‚Äã an optional stainless steel or‚Äå copper‚Äå grid drain, designed to prevent large particles ‚Å£from clogging‚Å§ the ‚Å¢drain while ‚Å§complementing the sink's‚Å§ aesthetic.

Key features‚Å§ of the Copper Apron ‚Å¢Farmhouse Sink include:

* 16-gauge copper construction
* Hand-hammered‚Äã texture
* Apron‚Äå front ‚Å¢design
* ‚ÄãProtective coating
* Sound‚Äç dampening pads
* Optional grid drain

I don't even know where to start or what to say. I just feel so sad and I'm not exactly sure what is the exact reason for that. I'm just gonna throw everything together and hope that this post makes at least some sense.

For the context of this story it's important to know that I'm (20F) not that sociable of a person. I love hanging out with people and I love partying as that is the only time i can feel completely relaxed, it's just that I have a hard time getting close to others as it's hard for me to open up to someone and I think that makes me look like a cold uninteresting person. I'm a huge anxious overthinker and it stops me from reaching out to people I meet which makes it hard to develop a friendship. I am well aware of those facts yet I can't change despite me feeling like shit because of it. Basically: I love social events and hanging out with friends it's just that I have no close friends.

On the other hand my boyfriend (20M) has plenty of friends. He would hang out with them every second of his time untill he met me. Now he's primarily with me, but they still meet up every now and then which does not bother me. I am well aware that just because I'm having trouble with my social life, I shouldn't force him to abandon his as well. I am happy that he's happy and that's all that matters. But behind all of that I feel so jealous. Every time he leaves with them I feel this huge amount of sadness and jealousy, because I've always longed for that myself. To be someone's first choice to hang out - to be wanted. I try to tell him that it's okay as it is not his fault, and that he should go without having to worry about me. But deep down I still feel hurt and abandoned.

That also brings me up to todays incident. There was this party today and I really wanted to go as I'm currently only rotting in bed and I hate that feeling of uselessness. I called up like the only two people I know that could be there but they both turned me down. I still had hope that maybe I could just go and somehow insert myself in a group of people I kinda know and just be with them. My boyfriend already had plans to go with his single male friends and have fun (he wanted to play the wingman). I don't want to be one of those partners that prevents their bf from seeing their friends so I approved of his plans and didn't want to be in his way at said party (like I still wanted to go, I just wouldn't be with him). But all of this just made me feel like shit. He knows that I have trouble getting friends and that I still love parties yet he didn't want me there as he wouldn't feel free. (He said that he'd feel under pressure if I were there even if we wouldn't be together and that he couldn't relax.) In the end he left me behind at his place where I was feeling sorry for myself while he went out. 

I guess that long story short, there are two problems that bother me.

1. The jealousy - the fact that it's so easy for him to make friends while I feel like a beggar asking someone just to a cup of coffee (as a friend of course). It's just that everytime he leaves with them I feel this flood of sadness knowing it's something I'm unable to have.

2. The fact that he prevented me from going to the event and left me all alone at his house, knowing I felt like shit because I couldn't go. I do think that him taking me with his friends would be unreasonable as I'd feel out of place, but I still think he could have been more reasonable about it and not just straight up prevented me from going, when I feel like this could've been an opporunity for me to meet some new people.

I don't know. I feel like a mess. On one hand I feel like my issues are real and something my bf should have been sensible about but on the other hand I feel like an impostor, like my issues are not that deep and I'm just making it all up in my hand.

1mfg4qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mfg4qn/a_town_called_oubliette_part_one/,A Town Called Oubliette Part One,"Looking back, the course of my life irreparably shifted on March 15th with a single card. Between getting fired from the best job I ever landed to the deep snow that suffocated the fun from life for a week, March started off strange. The great white blanket draped everything down to Montgomery. Fortunately, one thing about the Bible Belt is it never stays cold long; we were out of our thermals after a week or so. In the meanwhile, Walmart to Waffle House and everything in between was closed for business until the bridges unfroze. A courtesy a man with no groceries felt rather aggrieved by.¬†

The college was kind enough to offer an extra-long ‚Äúspring‚Äù break so as to not strongarm students into facing mortal peril just to save a grade. Unfortunately, midterms popcorned around my calendar as far out as Easter to account for the discrepancies with the syllabi.¬†

I only dreamed of this kind of winter as a kid. White Christmas, the whole shebang. Funny how much the world changes in such a short distance. The impossible becomes the uncommon. The common becomes the rare. From marshes to mountains, gators grow scarce and the air sits different on your skin. The trip from my parents‚Äô driveway to the curb outside my apartment demanded just over eight hours surfing the blacktop, accounting ninety minutes for gas, food, and restrooms if you cannot combine together all three.

Any weekend, especially since I never scheduled a class on Fridays, would suffice to visit; however, much to much filled out my daily loop. Assignments, exams, jobs, friends, parties. Any of the normal grab-bag bargain bin excuse someone living their life too fast would find comfort in pilfering off on a holiday phone-call or text to mom. Some as trivial as past kinship fell by the wayside on the itinerary of a man struggling to balance class with life, and life with class. Until that Monday afternoon.¬†

That afternoon, a black postcard peaked out between a stack of bills on the refrigerator box I called a coffee table. The post office had damaged the thing in transit. A big crease ran down the center and it looked like it had been tumbled in a mailsack all weekend. Still legible on the face was:

R.J. Landry - Memorial Service Saturday.

I guess I was lucky though. Three years is a long time for no one you know to die, but why did Papaw have to be the first to go? His light shone brightest out of all I have ever met. A great blinding beacon for home calling for us to share a game of dominos or seasoned slice of watermelon while the Saturday morning cartoons rambled on the box. The kind where floppy artists went to town in lieu of voice actors.

Finding a man like Papaw required patience and diligence like finding a blue crawfish. Most people may only meet one or two like him their whole life. Luck favored me enough for him to basically be my surrogate father. The kindest soul anyone would meet forged by the Depression, tempered by General Eisenhower, and annealed by devotion to his God.

He would always make sure my folks had us up and at ‚Äòem, seven sharp on Sundays. We would all pile into his Oldsmobile and help set up for the morning devotionals before service. It was as natural as caterpillars turning into butterflies when Papaw took up the cross after our original pastor passed away. Unending, unerring, unebbing. Three words summarized his love for his brothers and sisters confined to this mortal coil. I could not tell you any of Papaw‚Äôs sermons, but he always got fired up for the Lord. Before the benediction, he would always weave in a ‚Äúif you know that you know that you know‚Äù before inviting any and all down the aisle to the pulpit to give their life to the Great Commission.¬†

I rubbed the postcard, doing my best to flatten it out. I stubbed my toe on a stack of books as I stumbled across my living room to check my calendar. Out of reflex, I uttered a moderate ‚ÄúOuch.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù Stacy called from the kitchen, voice pitched a half-octave higher than usual as she leaned over the steaming pot, wooden spoon tapping the rim.

The question was asked with a particular kind of empathy. You know the kind where you feel the words come from the top of your throat while you speak with your whole face as nothing in the world is currently more important than ascertaining the truth of the situation. With the question came the smell of sweet tomatoes, dried pasta, oregano and the aroma boiling water makes on an electric stove.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine Stace. These stupid books got in the way of my foot.‚Äù I said as I leaned over the stack to circle Saturday.

Stacy poked her head around the corner with a raised brow. She looked me up and down before smiling and returning to working on our supper. We met in Psych 340 after working on a group assignment with just the two of us. A few late nights later we drifted into something she calls ‚Äúroommate adjacent.‚Äù

The drift collapsed the roof of her building. Old construction sometimes just cannot handle an extra train car worth of weight suddenly lumped on overnight. She took the bed and I surrendered myself to the couch.

I walked over to the kitchen, holding up the postcard.

‚ÄúFound this in the mail. My papaw‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, letting the words trail as my arm slackened and the card sagged between my fingers. Anymore required acknowledging he was truly a relic of yesteryear. That if I went home, Papaw would not be there to share in new memories and that I never again would hear his laugh, eat his cooking, and see the smile on his face when he talks to everyone.

Her face softened and she put down the spoon covered in pasta sauce. She gently grabbed the card and surveilled it carefully as if it contained ancient secrets unobtainable unless you searched each square inch for a minute apiece.¬†

She gently handed the card back, returning her gaze to my eyes like forming an aqueduct between us that allowed extra emotions to flow over instead of drowning me. ‚ÄúYou said he‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬† I said, swallowing and nodding once.

The timer on the stove shattered our moment. She turned and checked the pot before throwing the stiff pasta into the roiling water.¬†

‚ÄúYou going to go home?‚Äù she asked, flicking her wrist to scatter a pinch of salt, quickly looking back to capture my answer.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAllow me to rephrase. You are going home. You are going to be there for your grandmother and your father. You are gonna eat with them. Mourn with them. You are not gonna act like they don‚Äôt exist!‚Äù she said, turning to face me fully, one hand on her hip, the other still gripping the spoon like a paintbrush.

‚ÄúStace‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù I said, rubbing the back of my neck as my gaze slid to the floor.

She turned the stove off and grabbed me by the arms. I tensed up. We stood locked together like two stars refusing to fall into each other‚Äôs gravity while spiraling to an inevitable end. My eyes flickered between hers and hers remained on mine. I tried to gently pull away but her hands never left my arms.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not complicated. They love you. Be there for them.‚Äù¬† she said, squeezing once for emphasis timed with the love.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. Got a midterm Mon‚Äî‚Äù I said, the excuse catching in my throat as I looked past her shoulder at the boiling pot.

‚ÄúLiam, I know you believe your family hates you. You know the only other thing I know about you and your family? You are named after the man that saved your Papaw‚Äôs life. I know if you did not show up for his funeral, your Papaw would petition your God to send some messenger down so someone would be there with his son and wife as they grieve."" she said, softening, thumbs rubbing small circles on my sleeves.

‚ÄúAfter three years, what am I supposed to say? To do? I deserted them. I robbed them and ran.‚Äù I said, my words quickening as I spoke.

‚ÄúThey would embrace you in a heartbeat. First sign of you they would grab their keys and bring you out to eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never checked on them. Not on Christmas. Not on birthdays.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know that one place? You always complain nowhere here tastes as good.‚Äù She snapped her fingers as she was trying to remember.¬† ‚ÄúWhatsits‚Ä¶ with the country steak.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never called them. Never mailed them. Just shoved all their letters into a box.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the gas station you always rave about. You promised to take me sometime.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt love a son like me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said it‚Äôs practically a road hazard with how close it‚Äôs to the highway.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNicellies!‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòCellies?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòCellies.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you have to bring up ‚ÄòCellies. Now I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù I said, hand on my stomach as if it had just remembered its job.

‚ÄúPerfect! Spaghetti‚Äôs done. Eat.‚Äù she said. Stacy let go of me and turned around, ushering me toward the counter with one hand on my back and one inviting me forward.

Her hands rummaged through my meager plating options before finding two almost presentable plastic plates. Her hip leaned against the counter while she dipped up some noodles and sauce, sprinkling on a minute portion of oregano to garnish. Then, we buried the whole dish with enough romano to collapse a roof.

I sat down with my plate while Stacy began to pick up.

‚ÄúI forgot how much I like your weird sauce,‚Äù I said, half-smiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got that‚Ä¶ that thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúRed pepper flakes?‚Äù she asked, twirling her fork once to build up a decent morsel for a bite.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ the little cream in the red sauce.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ever tell you why I do that?‚Äù she asked, leaning into the counter again, cradling the plate in one hand.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said talking past the pasta in my mouth. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy brother had a dairy thing. Just a lick of it and he‚Äôd be on the toilet. So I grew up: no ice cream, no cheese, no milk. Nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat must have been horrible.‚Äù I said, setting my plate down, giving her my full attention.

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ but Dyl was worth it. Anyways. The cream. Mom had left the stove unattended to take a call in the living room. We had a carton of milk because Dad had grabbed what he swore was orange juice. Mom yelled at him when he brought it home and hit him on the back with a newspaper until he went back to the store to get some o j. Few days later‚Ä¶ time to strike. Milk into the pasta. I stirred it in and you couldn‚Äôt tell it was off. Momma got off the phone and fixed us dinner. It was delicious. Even Dad was surprised. Dyl licked his plate clean. While he was tearing up the bathroom, I was being tore up by a switch‚Ä¶. Hawthorne branches make for the worst switches.‚Äù

I let her memory linger while trying to digest just what I wanted.¬†

‚ÄúIf I go, and I‚Äôm not saying I will, would you go with me?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOf course, idiot. As long as they have a couch for you to sleep on.‚Äù she said, bumping my shoulder with hers.¬†

‚ÄúThey have a couch‚Ä¶ at least they did.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPerfect! We‚Äôll pack after class today and leave early Friday.‚Äù She jumped out her seat, tossed her plate in the sink and began wiping off the stove top from the red splatter everywhere.¬†

I leaned back in the chair until the front legs lifted off. I dropped my head back and watched her work in my inverted world.¬†

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôll get that. You‚Äôre my guest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI made the mess.‚Äù

**Knock.**

The sound rang flat in my apartment. A solitary occurrence, solid enough to add a slight echo in the furniture.¬†

I immediately stood.

‚ÄúExpecting company?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust you.‚Äù

The knock came again, just as firm.¬†

I walked over, pressing my head against the peephole while doing my best not to disturb any of the clutter on my floor. A man, mid-forties maybe, wearing a dark gray suit that had been recently pressed. A matching hat obscured his eyes from view. He planted himself at my welcome mat like a statue waiting to be disturbed. He held a large, brown leather notebook under one arm, a modern, black service weapon on his hip, and clean, gold metal badge hung from his neck.¬†

I undid the chain on the door and turned the deadbolt. Before I could introduce myself, he started with the questions.

‚ÄúEvening. Liam Landry?‚Äù He nodded subtly with his chin towards his identification in case I had missed it.¬†

‚ÄúGuilty as charged.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt joke, son. Detective Reave. Sorry for interrupting. Can I ask you a few things?‚Äù

Stacy joined us in the doorway, elbowing her way around me. Her brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy apologies, ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôve been on this missing persons‚Ä¶. Melanie Garner.‚Äù He unfolded his book and rifled through its bowels.¬†

‚ÄúMy dad always said tables are better for talking than thresholds.‚Äù Stacy waved him in.

""That's mighty kind."" He replied, taking off his hat.

We sat down at my small dining table and cleared off dinnerware to make room for him. The detective set down the book spine first and cracked it towards the middle, quickly finding his place. He licked a finger to separate two pages before producing a picture of a young, red-haired girl.¬†

The lady looked normal, unassuming. The kind of face impossible to stick out in a crowd, let alone recollect after the fact. Everyone has met two or three just like her. The barista at a local coffee joint, that one cheerleader no one remembers from the varsity squad, the teller from two months ago when rent was due. I could no sooner name and describe each of them than tell if or where I ever met this girl.

‚ÄúAm I suppose‚Äô to know who this is?‚Äù¬† I asked, squinting at the polaroid taped to the page.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Melanie. You‚Äôre in some of her courses.‚Äù¬† the detective said.

I blinked, focusing on the picture again before the detective turned the book back around. He flipped through more pages and his finger gave away where he was reading as he prepared his next move.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre enrolled in‚Ä¶. Psych 340. Melanie too. Second row, near the windows.‚Äù

I stared at him. Nothing. Not a clue nor voice. Not even a vague recollection of someone sitting in the corner of my vision.

‚ÄúShe ever talk?‚Äù he asked, studying my reaction.

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äì‚Äù I glanced over my shoulder at Stace. Then back to the officer. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know her. At all.‚Äù

Reave frowned, more disappointment than convicting.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange, ‚Äú he murmured, writing something.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember her. I swear.‚Äù¬†

He nodded once, but the silence lingered further than comfort allowed.

‚ÄúGreen? Frog memorabilia? Nasal laugh?‚Äù Reave prompted, ticking the items off with the backside of his pen from a list within his notes.

I shook my head each time.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry officer‚Ä¶ I hope you find her.‚Äù¬† I said, voice low as I sat back in the chair.

‚ÄúIf anything comes back,‚Äù he said, tearing off a card and handing it to me, ‚Äúgive me a call. Nothing is too small.‚Äù¬†

The officer stood and collected his work. At the door, he nodded us a goodbye and squeezed back into his navy blue Crown Vic. Stacy closed the door and when she turned back around she had the most confused face I have ever seen.¬†

‚ÄúLiam. We worked on a project with her before she stopped coming to class.‚Äù

I turned my head quizzically, trying my best to place everything.

‚ÄúShe had a green notebook with those gaudy stickers on it.‚Äù She said with a slight quiver in her tone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember every single person I talk too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to get defensive with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I could help, I would.‚Äù

Stacy shrugged, but I caught the way her fingers rubbed her elbow. The sound of clinking forks and running water filled the air of the kitchen. We stopped thinking about any Melanie and finished up our evening routines.¬†

I laid on the sofa watching animated programs while Stace showered and followed her skin-care program. When she emerged from the bathroom with charcoal paste smeared all over her, I showered quickly while she stood like a frozen doll trying to not get the stuff all over the apartment.¬†

After she disappeared into my bedroom, I reclined on the couch, phone in hand, scrolling through group messages half expecting to find that plain face staring back at me. Instead, nothing. Not a single mention. Just the faces I knew, inside jokes I barely laughed at the first time, and a dozen ill-solicited test keys.¬†

‚ÄúTired already?‚Äù Stacy asked from the hallway, now in an oversized shirt and no makeup.¬†

‚ÄúJust checking things.‚Äù

She gave a look, half understanding; the other half exhausted. ‚ÄúStill staying on the couch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

With a nod, she trailed off down the hall, shutting the door gently behind. I laid down on the cushions and stared at the ceiling, the hum of the fridge fading into the distant noise of passing cars. A faraway train rumbled and roared. I pulled the blanket over, phone still glowing beneath the covers. Eventually, I locked the screen and set it on the coffee table. The black card with the words *R.J. Landry Memorial Service Saturday* stared up at me from beside my phone. I turned away from it and closed my eyes.

I was in Dr. Alios‚Äôs lecture hall. Except it wasn‚Äôt the one on campus. This room was vast. It stretched into shadows that swallowed the ceiling. The lights buzzed like insects. The projector screen was blank, humming white noise. Alone near the front. My notebook lay open in front of me, pages filled with symbols I didn‚Äôt recognize. Circles inside triangles. Weird shapes and lines. Names I didn‚Äôt recognise. Dr. Alios stood behind the lectern, unmoving.

His suit was rumpled in a way that seemed intentional, like it had always existed in that state. Carved from birth to only form this one expression. His face was calm. Too calm. His lips moved slowly, repeating the same sound.

‚ÄúPa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.‚Äù

He said it like an inside joke between children. He reached his hand up to point at the projector, but streams of dust started pouring off his finger tip. His skin dissolved revealing the muscles beneath his index, then his whole hand. Soon every inch of skin and clothing had disintegrated off his body leaving only a red and white mess of lines that oozed crimson with each movement.¬†

‚ÄúPa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.‚Äù

Behind him, the wall began to ripple like heat rising from the blacktop in August. The heat became scorching. Stacy was now beside me. Her skin blistered and popped faster than I could try to shield her.

‚ÄúPa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.‚Äù

Alios raised both arms like a conductor before an orchestra. Lights lanced across the hall, slicing the empty chairs into pieces. When they passed over me, the room tilted and I saw my body sitting in the seat above me.

I tried to scream but what came out was not my voice. My lungs were filled the the roar of a hundred people singing in unison.

‚ÄúIf you know‚Ä¶‚Äù

A whole choir appeared in the empty places of the lecture. They replied in chorus.

‚Äú... that you know‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dr. Alios raised his hands for the crescendo.

‚Äú... that you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúPA.‚Äù

I sat bolt upright on the couch, sweat sticking my shirt to me. My heart ran laps inside my chest.

The apartment was quiet. My phone buzzed.¬†

\[Group Project - PSY340 \] ‚ÄúWhere were you sitting, Liam?‚Äù

A roar came from outside the door. The choir draped in black robes and wearing twisted faces and long eyes chanted in unison. Dozens of hands reached for me and pulled me over the balcony. I fell onto the curb.

I rolled off the couch and tore the sheet off me. My hair was matted from sweat and I need a new set of clothes. The cool floor felt welcoming. Reassuring. I lay there for a few minutes, letting the early gray creep in through the curtains.¬†

My fingers fumbled through the cushions pulling my phone from within. I quickly unlocked it and checked my messages. Nothing.

No ‚ÄúGroup Project ‚Äì PSY340.‚ÄùNo *Melanie Garner.* No *‚ÄúWhere were you sitting, Liam?‚Äù*

I clocked the messenger and re-opened it. Checked email. Scrolled through spam. Nothing.

Still half on the floor, I pressed my palms into the cold tile, waiting for my pulse to stop treating my neck like a punching bag. My breathing slowed, but the fog in my skull didn‚Äôt lift. If anything, it thickened. Like my thoughts were moving underwater. I climbed to my feet and staggered to the sink. Cold water. Splash to the face. Rinse, repeat. My reflection blinked back at me, pale and uncertain, eyes ringed in exhaustion. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôd slept for an hour or ten minutes.

I stood in the bathroom too long, watching my reflection waver in the mirror like it belonged to someone else. I brushed my teeth without toothpaste. Stared at my towel without drying off.

A calendar reminder lit my phone screen. **Psych Lab ‚Äî 9:30**. I flipped it over on the counter. I needed a change of scenery.¬†

The air outside nibbled less and less each day since the snow, but still Jack Frost still walked these streets. I grabbed my jacket and slipped out without making a creak. I passed the quad and dorms, almost fully across campus. By the time the sun was fully up, the chill left the air.

Tucked behind the old boiler building past the library, down a flight of dilapidated stairs. My shoes left prints in the thin layer of cigarette ash. Two red bulbs above a reinforced steel door were the only clue this place still had use.¬†

I stepped into a room with walls holding a copy of every book from the student store over the last hundred years and enough alcohol fumes to match. The furniture assemblage boasted a nice repertoire of Swedish build-it-yourself, heirlooms from old professors, and discount store salvage.¬†

Behind the bar Reagan waited in suspenders and a collarless shirt, polishing a glass that glistened with the dim light. He looked up.

‚ÄúSprite with bitters?‚Äù

‚ÄúSprite with bitters.‚Äù

The bartender leaned in, arms resting on the bar. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre grieving.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat obvious,‚Äù I said, barely louder than the hum of the old icebox behind him.

‚ÄúSecond best place for it,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúBest if alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ever serve a girl with red hair?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlenty.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt too pretty and she isn‚Äôt ugly neither‚Ä¶.‚Äù I called upon the memory of the picture from Reave. ‚ÄúShe has a mole, just below the corner of her left eye.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the first to ask,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWeek and a half ago. Girl with short hair, brown coat. Looked like she‚Äôd run a hundred miles barefoot.‚Äù

My throat dried. He reached under the bar.

From the shadows, he pulled out a small notebook. The journal was dressed in green, worn and bent. A cartoon frog decal on the front, peeling at the edges. The inside corner was dog-eared.

‚ÄúYour names inside.‚Äù

He set it down between us.

I didn‚Äôt touch it at first. Just stared.

Then, slowly, I opened the front cover. On the first page: a circle inside a square inside a triangle. On the inside cover in looping green pen: ‚ÄúIf you find this, Liam, go home.‚Äù

The bartender watched without speaking. Just wiping a glass with the patience of someone who had seen worse things than this.

‚ÄúThis is a joke, right?‚Äù I said, laughing too loud. ‚ÄúDid Stacy put you up to this?‚Äù

Reagan only gave a slow shake of his head. ‚ÄúI just keep the drinks cold.‚Äù

I flipped through the journal‚Äôs pages, faster now. Notes. Drawings. Scribbled observations about faces and names I didn‚Äôt recognize, all written with the manic precision of someone who had stopped sleeping. One entry was just my name over and over again.

Liam Liam¬† Liam ¬† Liam¬† ¬† Liam, go home.

‚ÄúWhat the hell does that even mean?‚Äù I muttered, my voice cracking around the last word.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Reagan asked gently, not moving from behind the bar.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I snapped, slamming the notebook shut. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not okay. I don‚Äôt know this girl!‚Äù

I shoved my chair back with a screech across the floor and tossed a crumpled twenty onto the counter. ‚ÄúKeep the change.‚Äù

I stormed out before he could say another word, the notebook still in my hand, my breath coming in hard, shallow bursts. The cold bit deeper this time, or maybe it was just in my head.

*If you find this, Liam, go home.*

*Go home.*

I broke into a jog. Then a sprint.

Through the quad, past a few early risers giving me side-eyes, across the cracked stone steps behind the dining hall and straight to my dorm. As much as I should talk to Stacy, I would just lash out at her.

I didn‚Äôt want to explain this. Not now. Not with my pulse chewing at my temples and the notebook hot in my hand.

I yanked open my duffel and started stuffing in shirts. Jeans. Phone charger. The postcard. The postcard\*\*!\*\* I almost forgot it. I folded it carefully and slipped it into my back pocket like it was armor.

Then I reached under the bed and grabbed the box I hadn‚Äôt touched since freshman year. Inside were the family photos Mamaw had sent with me. Ones I‚Äôd left face-down in the drawer for years.

The top one was of Papaw and me. I was five. We were in front of the church, and he was holding my hand in both of his.

I stared at it, and for the first time in a long time, I didn‚Äôt feel angry. Just tired. Tired of pretending I didn‚Äôt miss home.¬†

By the time Stacy texted to ask where I was, I was already halfway down to the parking garage. My fingers drafted several replies before settling on one.

Going home¬†

Let me drive you Liam.

No

We can take shifts, stop for lunch, find some happiness in the thing.¬†

You got the paper

Taking shifts means I can do it along the way. Plus, I want to meet your folks.

No

Which level?

Dont

Which level?

I ignored it, reached Level 3B and popped the trunk. The duffel thunked in beside my jumper cables and an old bookbag. I set Melanie‚Äôs notebook on the passenger seat.

Liam, 3B or 4A? I‚Äôm in the elevator.¬†

I hit the steering wheel with my palms several times before gripping the wheel tight enough to try and rip it off the steering column.¬†

3B

Thought so. You like parking next to the crack that looks like Florida.

I glanced at the column beside the parking space. The crack did look like Florida.¬†

She stepped out the stairwell with a backpack and two coffees. She walked up beside my window and knocked once.¬†

I lowered it an inch. ‚ÄúStace‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHalf-sugar. Drink it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said no.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear you, but I decline.‚Äù she said calmly.

I said ‚ÄúIf you come, I drive first. No stopping before the state line.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

We pulled out into the gray afternoon, concrete pillars flashing by like metronomes.

We merged onto the highway. The lines stitched forward. I let my head fall back and breathed. After a few miles, the coffee cooled in my hands and the knot between my shoulders loosened a fraction.

At mile 31, she reached for the dial. ‚ÄúGospel, classic rock, or public radio?‚Äù

‚ÄúGospel,‚Äù I said before I could overthink it.

A choir rose soft through the speakers, all low harmony.

‚ÄúOne question,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I promise it‚Äôs small.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we get there‚Ä¶ do I call him *Papaw* too, or is that just for you?‚Äù

It hit me in the throat in a way I didn‚Äôt expect. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd of liked that.‚Äù

-20s F
-5'6
-140lbs

-I walk+run an average: 6.8 miles a day
-Bouldering: 1-3 hours, 2x a week
-Weights: 1-2 hours 3-5x a week (if it matters I'm more of a power lifter, not sure if that effects how many calories I burn)

My activity stats are normal. I'm just extremely active so that will stay constant regardless, but I started a calorie deficit of ~680 calories where I'm eating sn average of ~1,450 calories a day. 

Average nutrition:
-144g carbs
-50g fat
-91g protein
-34g sugar

Im a pretty picky eater so my diet is literally:
-breakfast:oatmeal or just coffee with no food
-lunch: mini steak tacos
-dinner: more tacos with a fruit whey protein shake

Only ""bad"" thing i consume is like... and 5oz glass of wine. But that's just stress management 

I know like ~1600 is normal for weight loss but considering how active I am im not sure if that's overdoing it. 

My weight loss is more for aesthetic reasons than health. I'm already pretty lean/toned and people usually assume I'm like 100lbs, my 140 is largely muscle and not fat.  I just want to look leaner especially in my legs since my fat is literally all in my thighs and ass.  I dont think i can go below 130lbs without losing healthy muscle.

1mfg2vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mfg2vq/my_bf_went_to_a_party_without_me_and_it_made_me/,My bf went to a party without me and it made me lonely,"

I don't even know where to start or what to say. I just feel so sad and I'm not exactly sure what is the exact reason for that. I'm just gonna throw everything together and hope that this post makes at least some sense.

For the context of this story it's important to know that I'm (20F) not that sociable of a person. I love hanging out with people and I love partying as that is the only time i can feel completely relaxed, it's just that I have a hard time getting close to others as it's hard for me to open up to someone and I think that makes me look like a cold uninteresting person. I'm a huge anxious overthinker and it stops me from reaching out to people I meet which makes it hard to develop a friendship. I am well aware of those facts yet I can't change despite me feeling like shit because of it. Basically: I love social events and hanging out with friends it's just that I have no close friends.

On the other hand my boyfriend (20M) has plenty of friends. He would hang out with them every second of his time untill he met me. Now he's primarily with me, but they still meet up every now and then which does not bother me. I am well aware that just because I'm having trouble with my social life, I shouldn't force him to abandon his as well. I am happy that he's happy and that's all that matters. But behind all of that I feel so jealous. Every time he leaves with them I feel this huge amount of sadness and jealousy, because I've always longed for that myself. To be someone's first choice to hang out - to be wanted. I try to tell him that it's okay as it is not his fault, and that he should go without having to worry about me. But deep down I still feel hurt and abandoned.

That also brings me up to todays incident. There was this party today and I really wanted to go as I'm currently only rotting in bed and I hate that feeling of uselessness. I called up like the only two people I know that could be there but they both turned me down. I still had hope that maybe I could just go and somehow insert myself in a group of people I kinda know and just be with them. My boyfriend already had plans to go with his single male friends and have fun (he wanted to play the wingman). I don't want to be one of those partners that prevents their bf from seeing their friends so I approved of his plans and didn't want to be in his way at said party (like I still wanted to go, I just wouldn't be with him). But all of this just made me feel like shit. He knows that I have trouble getting friends and that I still love parties yet he didn't want me there as he wouldn't feel free. (He said that he'd feel under pressure if I were there even if we wouldn't be together and that he couldn't relax.) In the end he left me behind at his place where I was feeling sorry for myself while he went out. 

I guess that long story short, there are two problems that bother me.

1. The jealousy - the fact that it's so easy for him to make friends while I feel like a beggar asking someone just to a cup of coffee (as a friend of course). It's just that everytime he leaves with them I feel this flood of sadness knowing it's something I'm unable to have.

2. The fact that he prevented me from going to the event and left me all alone at his house, knowing I felt like shit because I couldn't go. I do think that him taking me with his friends would be unreasonable as I'd feel out of place, but I still think he could have been more reasonable about it and not just straight up prevented me from going, when I feel like this could've been an opporunity for me to meet some new people.

I don't know. I feel like a mess. On one hand I feel like my issues are real and something my bf should have been sensible about but on the other hand I feel like an impostor, like my issues are not that deep and I'm just making it all up in my hand.

Idk I just wanted to vent. Again I hope my post made sense and I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.",1,1754104294.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I was so awkward and nervous asking you for your number. But you were too and it was adorable.

We went for our first photography walk around the neighborhood. We saw hummingbirds and you taught me about the snails with the brain parasite. You also really opened up to me for the first time. I had already noticed your beautiful eyes, but for the first time, I felt I was looking \*into\* them.

I was once rather silly about not realizing how loud I was in the dog park so early. I felt a little embarrassed until I later learned it made you kick your feet.

You came to my aid, on the roof, when I was broken down to my lowest.

You were having one of those moments & needed space to feel all your feelings. You sat across from me on the other side of the sectional. You looked at me and asked if you could set next to me, because you just wanted to feel closer to me. We locked eyes & as I said ""of course you can sit next to me"", my heart skipped a beat. You just so naturally feel into my arms, and then we shared our first kiss.

The special connection you have with my little woowoo.

We took our cameras to the park to see all their fancy Christmas decorations at night. The little coyote startled you causing you to spill your coffee all over your camera. You started to panic but I quickly put my hands on your shoulder, looked into your eyes, comforted you that it would be okay because I had my camera cleaning stuff with me and I'd ensure it was clean and good. Your distress calmed and you said no one else had been able to do that for your before.

The time you first told me I was uncanny. Or when I picked you up and carried you to bed.

All those times we shared that special dark chocolate hot cocoa. And we'd share a quart of ice cream by simply eating out of it together with two spoons.

You provided me a holiday sanctuary. That week with you was easily my best week of the year.

The evenings we laid on my couch to watch a movie you hadn't heard of before.

All times one of us would text each other right as the other one was picking up their phone to text.

... Because I remember. I'll never forget any of these moments with you, my best friend, and love.",1,1754104270.0,readthatagain,0,1.0,False

However, narealize ko na siguro people here are just always on guard, kaya na misinterpret ko as masungit. 

Kanina, naghahanap ako ng grocery store and nagtanong tanong ako sa tapat ng UMC. The man I approached was so kind to the extent na pumara siya ng jeep for me and told me how to get to Walter. Sinabihan pa niya yung jeepney driver kung saan ako ibaba. Nakinig si kuya driver and dropped me off near the overpass. Mag ingat daw ako. Then narealize ko wala akong cash, buti nalang may tindahan nearby na nag ca-cash out. The lady was so kind and asked me if taga rito ba ako and kung kamusta raw stay ko so far. I really appreciated this gesture kasi wala naman pake mga tao sa Maynila HAHA. Anyways, pagka taas ko ng overpass I asked a student saan papunta Waltermart and she said she's going there rin. So talagang pinasabay niya ako papunta Walter and we talked for a bit pa. After groceries, nag ask ako sa Pickup coffee barista kung ano sasakyan pabalik UMC and nageffort pa talaga siya samahan ako sa sakayan kahit ang lapit lang naman. Tapos I just got added to our school GC and all of my classmates were so nice. I immediately clicked with everyone. Tomorrow, I'll meet up with some of them para tumambay.

This is our first with Princess, so I didn't realize things just changed in the last week as far as delivery availability. This was our experience for drinks only... Food was different. 

Could order drinks to room and never had an issue. Maybe ten minutes at most? Ordered 2-6 drinks at a time for two people. 

Could order drinks to pool(s) no problem. Even shorter wait time. 

Could NOT order drinks anywhere else inside.

Choices for drinks were very limited compared to in-person menus. But soda, water, coffee, tea, beer, liquor+mixer, select mixed drinks available. Looks like nine mixed drinks available to me at this moment for room delivery. None frozen. However, I know I did order frozen drinks at the pool with the app. 

Sitting inside (chairs/couches, not AT bar) we had mixed luck with traditional drink service. Piazza was generally just ok. Crown Grill area was very slow. Usually ended up going to the bar to order. 

OceanNow would have been more convenient, but I can also see why that would have made wait times everywhere MUCH longer. ",3,1754103826.0,PrincessCruises,1,1.0,False

1mffx5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/1mffx5x/ongoing_call_for_a_solidarity_walking_group/,Ongoing call for a solidarity walking group @ Marine Park,"What's up People,

About every week, I put out a blast for new friendlies around the way to join me for a Sunday morning meetup at the park. I'm Brooklyn-born, a stay-home dad to a near-2 year old, third generation Latin-American, aspiring fiction writer. I like Bernie Sanders and Robert Reich, basically old dudes still trying to school us on what's possible for the middle class. And I believe that local gatherings are a way to better understand my community, to fortify norms of good will during challenging times, and to work toward change when issues facing our borough demand it. People talking and interpreting events together, away from political forces and labels just seems wholesome to me. It's a relatively new social experiment for me and I'm looking for another 8-10 folks to join me to complete a solid dozen or so. It's inclusive; left, right, whatever. In fact I think the zero-sum games playing out in our government are sort of getting past the issue that solutions need to be felt by everyday people who need them the most. 

Regardless, I like listening to ideas and I want to know more about the people here (after 7 years of minding my own business in this area, I grew up not far in Midwood). We may end up philosophizing about all sorts of thing, or just generally talking about the weather. Making friends as an adult can be tricky, and algorithms don't help much.

It's not a huge investment of time. I'm there for a couple laps, maybe we get a coffee before or after. Or not, folks got places to be and I prefer keeping the ask light, but consistent.  With original flair, I call this project ""the walk."" There's also a discord for folks who want to hang out but can't make the trip.

Possible long term outcomes: a book club, group volunteering for the marine park alliance or local community patrol, an electoral workgroup or canvassing for local issues, team fitness training, field trips, etc. The greatest among them is generally feeling like we know our neighbors a bit better and feel more locally connected. But short term, it's super chill. Just everyday people talking seriously about nothing, like Seinfeld.

About a year and a half ago, due to medical reasons, I no longer can have caffeine. Mostly I don't mind it because I'm not a coffee person and most of my favorite sodas are caffeine free anyway (I like fruity stuff like sprite, grape, ext.) Anyway, the thing I miss the most is iced tea. I have tried to make my own at home but it is never the same. I have tried to get the Diet Caffeine Free Tea and I hate it because the artificial sweeteners don't sit with me well.

Does anyone know of any Caffeine Free but NOT DIET iced tea that you can buy in store? I've looked at everything from Arizona to Turkey Hill to so many store brands. I only have ever found one, ""Rutter's Southern Brewed Sweet Tea"" which is not diet and states it has ""less than 1 mg of caffeine per serving"", which is basically no caffeine. I live nowhere near a Rutters and I have found no way to buy that online and have it shipped to me.

Has anyone else ever found this type of tea? Specifically something I can buy online and have shipped to me? Again, I'm not looking for making tea at home or anything, I want to buy bottles / gallons of tea.

Horrified.,"Baby is now 3 months old. I've fallen into a pattern of feeds where I am mostly exclusively breastfeeding, however to make things fair for me, husband gets up with me for the overnight feed (occurs at around 1-3am). Husband feeds the baby a previously pumped bottle of breast milk while I pump. When I pump at this time, I usually receive around 90-120ml (3-4 oz) after 10 minutes of pumping. 

Today husband took baby out with him for coffee and lunch with friends to give me a bit of a break. He took a formula with him to feed baby as he'd be out past the time when baby was due for a feed. I pumped at home after he let me know he'd fed the baby. I only received around 50ml (1.6oz) after 10 minutes of pumping. Does this mean my baby has only been receiving 1.6oz during his feeds during the day?? Do I have low supply during the day?

A home with a kitchen that has yellow walls and a nice clean tile floor with a rug in front of the sink so that any water that might be spilled is absorbed.

A home with a dining room that always has the smell of vanilla and fresh baked goods, a rectangular dining table that has a checkered tablecloth laid over it and and a vase of fresh flowers in the middle. 

A home with a living room that has a gorgeous big couch and lots of comfortable blankets, a coffee table that has a stack of coasters in the corner of it for when someone has a drink.

A home with a big backyard that's covered in perfect green grass, garden beds with gorgeous homegrown produce , and a colorful hammock that lays underneath the shade of a tree.

But true intentionality, to me, is about aligning your daily actions with your values and priorities. It's about making conscious choices, whether that's as simple as taking a few minutes to savor your morning coffee instead of rushing through it, or decluttering a drawer to reduce stress. You can be elegantly intentional with a thrift store find just as easily as with a designer item.

ACT 2: The Ovens of Fear.

*Cut to the detention room. Safety patrol members are checking the room while Jeff sits under a blanket, covered in toilet paper and shivering as Ingrid tries to talk to him. Vallejo slips past the murmuring crowd outside the door, all trying to take pictures and ask questions, and into the detention room, shutting the door.*

Vallejo: Fillmore, what happened?

Fillmore: Our informant just got TP'd like the toothbrush house on halloween.

*Vallejo shakes his head.*

Vallejo: How? He was under our protection.

Fillmore: Someone must‚Äôve slipped in under our nose. That or toilet paper became sentient.

*Vallejo gives Fillmore a tired look when Tahama yells.*

Tahama: Hey! I found something.

*Vallejo and Fillmore look at each other and walk over to Tahama who is standing by a wall. She turns to them as they approach.*

Tahama: Look.

*She presses on the bricks of the wall and they wiggle. Ingrid and Fillmore share a look and begin to pull down the bricks revealing a passageway.*

Vallejo: What is this? A secret passageway to our holding room?

*Fillmore turns on his flashlight and looks inside the passageway. It is small, barely tall enough to crawl through. The passageway is free of dust.*

Ingrid: It must be the remains of an old ventilation shaft. Someone must‚Äôve replaced the bricks with these phony ones.

*As they look at the shaft, Fillmore notices something shoved in the corner. He crouches down and reaches over, grabbing an envelope.*

Fillmore: Disco.

¬†*Ingrid looks at him.*

Ingrid: What is it?

Fillmore: It‚Äôs a letter.

Vallejo: Yeah, we can all see that.

*Ingrid rolls her eyes as Fillmore carefully opens the envelope, pulling out a piece of paper. The paper is covered with letters cut out of magazines. It says REVENGE IS A DISH SERVED COLD, BUT IT‚ÄôS BEST PREPARED IN THE OVENS OF FEAR. Ingrid rubs her chin.*

Ingrid: What does it mean?

*Fillmore raises an eyebrow.*

Fillmore: Someone is out for revenge.

*Then Jack runs into the room.*Jack, panting: You must hurry, they got another. This time in the cafeteria.

*Ingrid and Fillmore share a concerned glance and run out of the room. Cut to them entering the cafeteria where Safety Patrol Officers are looking for evidence. A broken stand in the center of the room and a brown haired girl is sitting on a table, covered in custard. Safety Patrol members are scouring the scene as Ingrid, Vallejo, Fillmore and Jack enter the room.*

Vallejo: What in the name of the Jolly Green Giant happened here?!

Jack: Someone sabotaged Olivia‚Äôs attempt at the largest Custard bowl. Rigged the stand to collapse.

*Vallejo nods and Jack goes back to taking pictures of the crime scene.*

Fillmore: Another one. Two attacks barely minutes from each other. But how?

Vallejo: They planned it out?

Ingrid: Or they have people working with, or for, them.

Fillmore nods, musing to himself: But why these two?

Vallejo nods: That‚Äôs the question.

Jack: Hey guys, I found something!

*Vallejo, Fillmore, and Ingrid turn to Jack, who pulls out a note from under the broken remains of the stand.*

Vallejo: What does it say?

Jack: It says ‚Äú*WALK AWAY, THIS IS NOT YOUR BATTLE. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.‚Äù*

*Ingrid motions for Jack to hand her the note, which he does before taking more pictures.*

Vallejo: What do you make of this?

*Ingrid looks at it.*

Ingrid: It appears to be a threat. Whoever it is, it seems they don‚Äôt want us to interfere.

Fillmore: Looks like it.

Vallejo: So, you're saying we have a criminal mastermind leaving threats after attacking their victims?

Ingrid:It appears so.

Vallejo: But why? What do they all have in common?

Ingrid: They are all new? John came here a month ago, and Oliva just transferred here.

Jack: They served detention? Olivia was just in yesterday.

Fillmore, rubbed his chin, then stated solemnly: I caught them.

Vallejo jerks, nearly spilling his coffee: Woah, you‚Äôre saying this might be a sort of twisted revenge against you?Fillmore: A cat plays with the mouse before eating it.

Ingrid shakes her head: That may be so, but it might also be something else. We don‚Äôt know yet.

*Vallejo, sighs, rubbing his temple as he realises he has a long day ahead of him.*

Vallejo: So who will be next?

*Fillmore thinks, then remembers who they caught this morning.*

Fillmore: Gretchen.

Vallejo: Are you sure?

Fillmore: Yes, she has a record.

Ingrid: Wait, I remember. Gretchen moved here a month ago and is currently serving detention‚Ä¶

Fillmore: Cause I caught her this morning.

*Vallejo quickly turns to Fillmore.*

Vallejo: Fillmore, protect Gretchen. Now!

Ingrid: I‚Äôll go check the ventilation shaft.

Fillmore: Radio in if you find anything.

*Cut to Fillmore running through the hall. He rushes into the detention where Gretchen sits looking bored. She looks up, more out of boredom than curosity.*

Gretchen, with a yawn: What ya want now?

Fillmore: You're being targeted, I‚Äôm here to keep you safe.

*Gretchen leans back and looks at Fillmore, rolling her eyes.*

Gretchen: I can take care of myself, thank you very much.

FIllmore: It‚Äôs not about you, it's about getting the one out for you.

*Gretchen shrugs. Fillmore looks around and then hears a twang. He whips around, catching sight of a balloon racing towards him from a slingshot. He jumps forward and shoves Gretchen out of the way.*

Fillmore: Move!!

*A balloon comes flying at Gretchen but Fillmore jumps in the way. It breaks open, covering him in a dark purple jam. He looks up from the floor to see the assailant running away. Fillmore gives chase.*

Fillmore: X MIDDLE SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL, FREEZE!!

Fillmore then yells in his radio: I got suspect on the move, running towards the gym.

Ingrid: Copy.

*The figure turns and shoves down a pile of boxes. Fillmore jumps over them and the figure runs to the gym. FIllmore follows, slamming open the door to find the assailant climbing out the window. Ingrid runs in from the other gym door and they both run after him. Fillmore reaches the wall first, but as he climbs up, the assailant turns and drops a box of custard at Fillmore. Fillmore jumps back and falls to the ground. Ingrid catches him as they watch the figure get away.*¬†

Ingrid, as she puts Fillmore on the ground: You good?

Fillmore, standing up: No, I look like the Grimace just had the cafeteria‚Äôs tacos.¬†

Ingrid smiles a bit: You want me to come with you back to headquarters?

Fillmore: No, I got this. Go find out what‚Äôs happening in that vent.

Ingrid nods and walks away, laughing quietly: The Grimace after cafeteria tacos, where does he come up with this stuff?

I grew up way below the poverty line and I knew it from a super young age. Pros and cons to that knowledge as a kid for sure - one of the pros being I taught myself to save so I wouldn‚Äôt stay poor. I am 29 and have over 200k saved‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs some things that I‚Äôve done: 

Gas light myself into thinking I‚Äôm poor

Only subscription is Spotify and I share duo with my dad - I use my brothers tv streaming site. 

Never buy anything that puts me in debt - worked a ton in uni so I‚Äôd be able to pay off all my loans when I graduate, both cars I‚Äôve bought with cash (I would have continued driving my first but it got totalled) 

Never order drinks or apps when at a restaurant, always order one of the cheapest meals 

Tip based on service, only tip when being served at a restaurant (not on take out, etc) 

Never buy little treats while out and about unless I have a gift card 

Don‚Äôt drink coffee

Never buy drinks at the bar - pre drinking is more fun anyway

I used the university food bank while in uni and ate a lot of soup 

Being okay with being a bit uncomfortable - ex: if it‚Äôs raining and I don‚Äôt have an umbrella I‚Äôll get wet before buying another umbrella, even if I‚Äôm hungry I‚Äôll wait til I get home to eat 

Have never paid for a haircut - mom or friend can cut a straight line 

Don‚Äôt spend on things like nails, lashes, etc. 

Bought a $25 dog grooming kit and have been grooming my own dog with it for the last 8 years 

Cash jobs - babysitting in rich neighbourhoods (they tip and have a lot of snacks in the kitchen), tutoring for $60/h in uni was amazing 

Lived in a really crap apartment building after I graduated from uni 

Lived with roommates this past year 

My roommate gets me dog food from her work (people donate it but they don‚Äôt use it) 

Almost never buy anything new. Always barter a bit on marketplace purchases (especially furniture) 

I‚Äôm a big reader (like 60+ books a year) but have NEVER bought a book new. I can wait for the library‚Äôs copy

I have a lot of clothes, but they‚Äôre almost all hand me downs or used and up to a decade old. I don‚Äôt get rid of clothes so I always feel like I have lots of options and don‚Äôt feel like I need to refresh my wardrobe ever 

Rewear clothes until they are actually dirty. Keeps them looking new longer and save on electricity/laundry detergent 

Never buy anything organic or overpriced at the grocery store. Look at grocery flyers every week and price match/shop sales. Only shop at budget grocery stores 

My family no longer does Christmas presents (we‚Äôre all adults) but for my boyfriend I‚Äôll shop all year for sales. I bought one of his presents for this year on Boxing Day last year (same goes for birthday/anniversary) 

Think how much a concert is really worth - they are so expensive now and I just find it hard to spend $200+ on one night of music 

Say NO to things other people want me to do if I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money 

Calculate how much I make hourly and when I‚Äôm thinking of buying something, calculate how many hours i would have to work for it 

Any time we have food days at work, I take food home for later 

I‚Äôm a teacher and there is always pizza leftover from absent kids on pizza day. I take it all home and freeze it

I don‚Äôt do this anymore but I used to take TP from doctor‚Äôs offices or anywhere that has rolls (not like the giant half ply ones). But only if I‚Äôve paid for something there and I would never take the last one ",0,1754101805.0,povertyfinance,6,0.44,False

Books. Then popcorn. Then lizards for some reason.

DAN
It‚Äôs time, Chris. We‚Äôre going to war.

CHRIS

With who?

DAN
Not who, what. Soap. The slippery industrial snake oil poisoning America one loofah at a time.

At the end, we learn that Edward somehow got his cancer into remission (a ""medical miracle"", in his own words), while Carter succumbs to his cancer after a last ditch effort surgery. 

Throughout the film, Edward consumes an extremely expensive Kopi Luwak coffee, which Carter ridiculous and dismisses. In one of the last scenes, Carter reveals to Edward that the coffee is produced from beans defected by Asian palm civets. They both have a hearty laugh to the revelation, and that's the ""end"" of the fancy coffee plot line. 

However, Kopi Luwak actually has various health benefits that typical coffee lacks, notably higher antioxidant levels.  Carter and Edward were living, eating, and consuming the same events and food for the months following their terminal diagnosis - expect for the Kopi Luwak coffee.

## Key Features Analysis

The best pinecone candles offer a combination of aesthetic appeal,fragrance quality,and burn performance.

**Real Pinecone Integration:** Many high-quality pinecone candles incorporate real, dried pinecones into their design. These pinecones are carefully selected and arranged to create a visually appealing and natural look.The pinecones are usually secured within the wax or attached to the exterior of the candle,adding texture and dimension to the overall aesthetic. The use of real pinecones differentiates these candles from those that rely solely on molded shapes.

the visual authenticity of real pinecones considerably enhances the candles' rustic and natural appeal.**Scent Profile:** an authentic and long-lasting pine scent is a hallmark of a well-crafted pinecone candle. The fragrance should evoke the crisp, clean aroma of a pine forest, without being overpowering or artificial. Top-rated candles utilize essential oils or high-quality fragrance oils specifically formulated to replicate the scent of pine, fir, or other evergreen trees. Some candles include subtle undertones of cedarwood, sandalwood, or spice to add complexity and depth to the overall fragrance.

The quality of the scent is crucial for creating a relaxing and inviting atmosphere.**Wax composition:** The type of wax used in a pinecone candle directly impacts its burn performance, scent throw, and overall longevity. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean-burning properties, minimal soot production, and ability to hold fragrance effectively. Beeswax is another premium option, known for its natural aroma and long burn time. Paraffin wax, while more affordable, may produce more soot and have a weaker scent throw compared to soy or beeswax.

The wax used is an crucial aspect of judging the candle's overall value and environmental impact.

**Burn Time:** A longer burn time translates to greater value and extended enjoyment of the pinecone candle. premium candles can burn for 40-60 hours or more,depending on the size and wax composition. Factors such as the wick size, wax type, and ambient temperature can all influence burn time.A longer burn time minimizes the need for frequent replacements,making it a more convenient and cost-effective option.

A longer burn time contributes to the product's overall cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

**Wick Quality:** The wick plays a critical role in ensuring a clean and even burn.Cotton wicks are commonly used in pinecone candles and are available in various sizes and weaves. Lead-free wicks are essential for safety and environmental reasons. the wick should be appropriately sized for the candle's diameter to prevent tunneling (where the wax only melts in the center) or excessive smoking.

The wick's proper size and composition ensures a safe and efficient burning.

1mfex7s,https://i.redd.it/h0hgnzoeligf1.jpeg,Daughter (Cross-post from r/CreepCast_Submissions),"I slowly paced back and forth through the upper apartment of the entire home we were renting from an unsavory landlord. Despite his searching for answers to his life's problems at the bottom of a bottle, he cobbled together a two story home which gave safe harbor to my quaint family.

My daughter, Rose, was finally fast asleep, gripping my loose white tee shirt. I sighed quietly with relief, as this was not the first night we had trouble putting her down for extended sleep.

Rose had just hit the milestone of seven months old, by now she was able to provide much needed sleep for myself and her mother by not requiring feeding every two hours. For the first few days as a seven month old, she was as precious as could be, wistfully snoring away the moonlit hours with no crying or fussing, allowing some hard earned rest to her parents. While I could function off of five hours minimum, my wife struggled more with the lack of sleep. I did right by my wife, offering endless support. It was the least I could do after she pushed our eight pound seven ounce miracle free from her 'guttyworks'.

It was an interesting time being a parent, I couldn't help but smile as I sat on our sectional couch in the living room, finally allowing my eyes to close for the night, my daughter safely deposited into her crib. No sooner did I relax, did a frightful cacophonous wailing echo throughout our apartment.

Bolting upright, I quickly strode into my daughters room, opening the door gently as I possibly could to minimize any distress the poor child was dealing with. Despite the incessant wailing, Rose calmly slept. Her mouth did not move, nor did she have any expression of pain across her cherub face. She looked warm, comfortable, and altogether unbothered by the situation. I rested my hand upon her crib that I built myself staring at her muffled movements in the darkness of her room.

As my sleepy parent brain adjusted, I could still hear the crying, though it was coming from another part of the upstairs floor. I crept around slowly, as my wife was still fast asleep in bed, only to find our black cat, Felony, wide awake and sitting at the sliding glass door to our back deck. Her tail twitched, and brushed the cold linoleum as her ears perked up at the increasingly distressing wailing.

It sounded just like Rose on her worst day, if she absolutely wasn't having it. Walking up to Felony, I scratched her backside. She calmly turned her emerald eyes toward my beleaguered face and let out a quiet meow, as if whispering to me to not disturb whatever was making that terrible racket.

Sitting on the cold linoleum floor, staring out at the night sky offered me some perspective. Though the crying was worse from this part of the house, it appeared as though it was coming from below our deck. I checked my smart watch. The ruddy cheeks and baggy eyes of mine formed a strange reflection overlapping with *Mickey Mouse*'s whimsical eternal smile from the sixties. The digital clock read 4:08AM.

I opened the glass door to the back porch and stepped outside, with Felony in tow.

""Call Clyde."" I whispered into my smart watch. The silent vibrato buzzed in the quiet dawn of the not-yet-morning.

""Mikey."" The voice responded, awake, as I thought he would be.

""Hey, I just put Rose down, do you think you can-""

""I'm so sorry, son. I gotta get better at this."" His quick apology assured my suspicions. Clyde, my wife's father, had been living below us for the better part of a decade, helping our small family grow and help us pay the cost of rent to the building. The old-timer was good for money, and loved Rose, as she was the first legitimate grand-child he was ever able to hold in his arms. Clyde had a proclivity for all kinds of action and horror movies, habitually watching them at a volume wholly reserved for *AC/DC* concerts. Aside from that one quirk, he was a stellar father-in-law, and did right by us.

""Thanks man, I'll get you a coffee tomorrow.""

""Appreciate it, kiddo. Welcome to raising children.""

""How am I doing so far?"" I asked, knowing he'd be straight with me.

""Better than most. I'll let you get some sleep."" With that, he disconnected the call. I sighed and went back into the house. The caterwauling had stopped, and Felony was uninterested in the sliding glass door. I gave her some treats, as a reward for helping me solve the mystery of the wailing baby. I then got comfortable on our sectional couch, and fell fast asleep.

Four hours later with coffee in hand, I knocked on the lower door to our house. Clyde groggily opened the door and scratched the two caterpillars on his face he called eyebrows.

""Here."" He swiped at his mug, but I pulled back letting him suffer for a moment. ""I don't want to be a bother but the headphones we gave you last Christmas, how come you don't use those?"" I then handed him his coffee, which he graciously accepted.

""They aren't loud enough."" He took a swig of the morning brown and waggled an eyebrow. ""I mean, well, they broke.""

""How did they break?"" The cost wasn't the issue, we could easily get him another pair, but it was upsetting that a man so good with older technology could scarcely keep a pair of analog headphones in good condition.

""Tried to turn them to max volume, with that little wheel do-hickey. It snapped and broke the volume control. I can't get any sound in them anymore. Sorry."" He looked downcast. I suddenly felt as if I had kicked a small puppy. I relented.

""Well, alright man. Just, no more late night horror movies anymore. That wailing was terrible."" I paused when he furrowed his brow in confusion. ""What?""

""Mikey, I was watching *Casablanca.*""

""Good one."" I wasn't a fan of the classics, but there was no way in hell a crying baby was in *Casablanca*.

""No, seriously. Look."" Clyde beckoned me into his neatly kept apartment. He had an expansive collection of physical movies and multiple combination DVD & Blu-Ray players. The prize of his collection was a vintage *Sony* SL8000 Beta-max player. It rarely saw use, but sat atop a pedestal closely among the VHS devices that absolutely dominated the market at the time.

On his coffee table, with his pack of cigarettes and a drained glass of bourbon, still sitting next to a mostly full bottle, was the VHS copy of *Casablanca*. The tape that rested in the sleeve had been inserted into the fourth most available VCR closest to one of his old tube television sets that he utilized for the *experience*.

""Refresh my memory, do any babies cry in that movie?"" Maybe I was wrong. Maybe when Humphrey Bogart said *'Here's looking at you, kid.'* It could have been possible that his delivery, although perfect, would have upset a baby nearby.

""Mikey, you're a new parent. This is the first time you and Angela have ever done something like this. Look, go to work. I'm off today so I can take Angie and Rosie out for some dinner and you can catch up on some sleep when you get home."" I nodded along to his prattling. I knew what I heard last night, I didn't think it was some fluke. Even Felony heard something. But I figured Clyde was right. I just wanted to be a good dad. This opportunity of fatherhood was something that had happened once before, but was ripped away from me.

""Yeah, okay. You're right. Thanks.""

""We're family. You're a good dad. Even the best of dads need a break now and again."" Clyde clapped me on the shoulder, and I left for work.

I couldn't focus a lot on my tasks that day. The mundane office job I had was better than most. Free coffee, a gym across the hall, lots of downtime between calls on the weekends. Something kept digging at me. Clyde called me a good dad, but I'm sure he wouldn't if he knew some of the earlier choices I made in life.

I was sweet on his Angela. The anatomy of our love blossomed when I first met her at Church. Angie and I had been in love for a few years, and I took it slow. But before Angie, there was Veronica. She was the first woman I had married. It was a different love than Angie. Angie was safe, and she had a good work ethic. She wasn't about taking risks, nor was she unpleasant to be around. She had a beautiful smile and was traditional in all aspects of home-keeping. I had to fight her just to do chores around the house. But Veronica, she was something else entirely.

Veronica oozed freedom. She was an untamed mythical eagle forever soaring among the clouds, this woman could turn any mundane encounter into an adventure. She lived fast, and hard, and loved just as equally. When I had proposed to her all those years ago, I was sure she'd laugh in my face. But she surprised me.

""Okay lover-boy. Make me yours."" She was the Mary-Jane to my Peter Parker.

Everything she did was crazy, and I was just happy to be along for the ride. She was full of beautiful life, and vim, until she we got pregnant. Veronica changed completely.

Around her friends she was still this legend among legends, but she slowly turned insular. No longer did she feel like going out, or doing the fun things we did. She wasn't about drinking, or drugs or partying that way, but you can be damned sure she would be the first at the front of the concert venue, dancing like crazy to whatever songs were on the playlist.

At twenty weeks, when we found out it was going to be a girl. Veronica snapped. She practically shoved her denim skirt back down and pushed the ultrasound tech to the ground. I hastily apologized while I chased after my then pregnant wife. She got in the driver's seat of our mustang and glared daggers at me as I got in.

""I can't do girls Mikey. Nuh-uh, no way."" She was upset, and now had been venting, driving erratically across the back roads that wove through the dense forests which would take us back home. Her eyes were tear stained, and she would constantly take her hand off the wheel to rub away the rogue tears streaming down her face. Though I hated it, she still smoked small puffs of cigarettes, but when she was livid the long drag of nicotine was the only master that could tame her foul temper. Veronica would let go of the wheel to rummage for her cigarettes and light one, puffing like a dragon as she floored the gas.

""Why not? I thought you'd be thrilled. You'd make the coolest mom I'd ever know."" The compliment was lost on her. I hold onto the *whoa fuck* handle in the passenger seat, regretting not pulling her out of the drivers seat.

""No way. My mom was a cunt, she treated me like shit, like I was nothing."" Tears streamed down her face.

""That doesn't mean you'd treat our little girl like that. It's a blessing babe, how good will it feel to be an even better mother then your mom?"" I never would get anything further from Veronica as it was destined a tree would fall in our path. As her one hand was free wiping away her tears, she overcompensated with the other, lurching the car over the cliff down into the forest below.

I don't remember much of what happened during the rolling of our car, but I remember being thrown quite a distance. When I woke from the delirium, what I saw would be etched into my memory forever.

Veronica was dead, her neck snapped and bent at an odd angle. Her eyes and mouth were permanently in a surprised expression, as the vertebrae of her spine stuck out from her neck, without breaking skin. There seemed to be an internal pooling of blood from the odd angle of her neck.¬†The bulging H.R. Geiger nightmare gawped from broken branches at me like the eye of Satan.

Though it was assuredly broken, it looked like a pimple yet to pop, as the swelling red liquid rose to the point that just couldn't penetrate her skin. Something must have detached from the car, as her belly was split wide open. The morbid cesarean performed on her by what was likely car or tree shrapnel was horrific.

Her lower intestine had sagged somewhat, and the umbilical cord complete with what was still my developing daughter rested just below on the ground. Our unborn daughter who was still attached to the mother quivered in the cold.

I stood stock still, shocked at the carnage that lay before me. I could only stare at the underdeveloped infant that was my unnamed daughter as it struggled to survive. Overcome by the accident, and bleeding from my head, I didn't know what to do. The poor child, not yet made for this earth expired, it's little lungs unable to suck air or cry. The horrible noise it made as it took its last breaths on this plane of existence were mucus filled cries, not loud enough to be anything considered human, but they would haunt me to this day.

At the time, all I could do was weep. I took the discarded remains of our child and placed it further ahead in the woods, hastily burying it with leaves and twigs. Her glassy eyes looked at me from beyond the veil. I don't know if it was shame on that small face that glared at me, or it was upset at its circumstance. It was the best I could do at the time. I later lied to the paramedics who arrived on scene upon me calling for assistance and said I had been out for some time. I made a great effort to hide my tracks to our unnamed baby's grave, I didn't want to ever relive the memory of the alien creature of my wife's insides, warbling as it died. When all was said in done, I was in the hospital by 4:08pm.

The guilt would still bubble over sometimes as I held Rose tight to my chest. I lamented the life un-lived from my first child, the one that would never be.

""Mikey, you okay?"" Snapping out of my haze, from the fluorescent lights of the call center, I turned to see one of the other team leads waving a hand in my face. ""Getting enough sleep there, bud?""

""Yeah, sorry. Parenthood is tough. This is you in three weeks Michelle, though I figure since you're growing the child you'll probably more tired."" She smiled and rubbed her belly to my response.

""Yeah, I start my maternity leave tomorrow. I'm excited. Rick keeps asking how you've been doing and I tell him you look tired each and every day. He said he's gonna take some paternal leave to help me for the first little bit.""

""I advocate for that. I would take more if I could, to be honest. Tell him to take two months, not one.""

""I will, thanks. Hey, it's not super busy, I can cover for you if you wanna go home?"" She didn't have to ask me twice, I clocked out from my desk and gave her a hug. She waved me out of the office and I left to the security guard telling me to get some rest.

The drive home was four minutes and eight seconds. I was still groggy by the time I climbed the stairs and unlocked the door. Angie was still home, and Rose was in good spirits. I mumbled to her one word; 'sleep' and passed out on the couch. I could hear Rose babbling happily and in the ether of my dreams, eventually I heard the front door open and then close.

The smell of pizza woke me out of my coma. I found a note on the box:

*Triple cheese, just as you like it. We're out for dinner. My dad said you needed a night off, and Rose needs to learn about restaurants. Plus I'm excited for the 'kids under three eat free' deal. We'll be home later.*

*Love, Angie*

The first bite of the slightly cold, but still incredibly greasy pizza uplifted my spirits. I cried a single tear of joy that my creature comforts were still looked after by my wife. Angie was certainly a lover more true than the sun, gifted by Christ himself. My father once told me that marriage is split sixty-forty. The trick of the split is that both halves of the partnership were always trying to be the sixty in that split.

The bliss I felt, did not last long as Felony suddenly darted towards the back of the apartment, and sat stock still at Rose's bedroom door.

I heard a muffled cry from her bedroom.

My heart leapt into my chest. I re-read the note Angie had left me. ""*Rose needs to learn about restaurants.*"" Clearly Rose wasn't here. This certainly wasn't a restaurant.

What the fuck.

What was making that God-awful noise?

I sent Angie a text: *Rose is with you, right?* It was a stupid question, obviously, but I had to be sure. I didn't get a response right away so I slowly began the long walk to the back room. Every crease in the floorboards and creak from my weight caused me great unease.

What was happening?

What am I walking into?

Why is it upset?

What *is* it?

More questions raced through my mind as I slowly opened the door to the bedroom. I didn't turn on the light. The only ambient lighting that shone through the curtains was the setting sun. The crying continued, though it wasn't as loud as it was before. Felony suddenly stood up, her hackles raised as she made a low hiss, not wanting to step a single one of her paws into the room.

""It's okay girl, shh. I'll be okay."" I didn't truly know if I would be. Felony stood her ground, but walked no further. The dread of stepping closer to whatever was making the noise made my heart hammer loudly in my chest. As I took a single step into the room, my phone vibrated. The crying continued, this time louder.

Slowly, I read the message, now horrified at what I might find.

*Rose is here with me and my dad.* Attached was a picture of my beautiful daughter with spaghetti sauce on her porcelain features. I looked into the crib which had a lumpy figure moving within the blanket. I tried to rationalize what it was that was wailing so maliciously. Taking a breath, removing the blanket, I fell back screaming in sheer terror.

Veronica's baby, my other daughter, had found its way to me.

The umbilical cord clung to the child and its stout features. Its skin, her skin, was mottled and red. Though she would have been twenty weeks old at the time, whatever epidermis that would have been forming gave a sinewy appearance, was battered by an unkempt forest floor. Dried leaves and mud were spattered on the creature. It had two overlarge glassy eyes, that had a yellowed appearance in the sclera. She lacked a nose, but instead had a pushed in slit and cleft palate where the nose should be. The horror of her mouth had two sets of sharpened teeth on the top and bottom, and the mouth opened at a grimace that would be impossible for a regular baby. The shape of the horror could almost be described as avian.

This undulating creature from my personal hell, climbed over the edge, and lowered itself to the floor. I scrambled back more, back toward the doorway, but hit the corner of the door frame, hurting myself in the process. With every movement it made, a feeble step, or it crawling trying to stand, and fail, on unformed legs with no joints to support it, an ungodly squelching noise came with it. It would hoist itself up on its two legs, and then fall forward clumsily on its hands. With every failed attempt to stand and walk, it shrieked in agony. As it inched ever closer to me, I could see a prehensile tongue flick out, much like a crawling lizard, wafting through the air, trying to determine where I was.

The terrible howl continued, Felony raising her own into the fray. The orchestra of madness reached its zenith, when courage finally found me.

I flicked on the bedroom light.

Gone was the totality of darkness, the room now bathed in a comforting light.

The creature, my unborn child, that terrible *thing,* was no longer there.

Any viscera it had left in both the bassinet, or the floor of Rose's room was gone. Felony and I both were confused, and still rattled from the experience.

""You saw that too girl?"" The emerald green eyes of my cat gave me a knowing look.

My phone was vibrating. Six missed calls from Angie. What was perhaps only a minute was in actuality half an hour. I immediately called her back as I searched Rose's room for the malfeasance that lingered within it.

""Michael, are you okay?"" She was stern, using her motherly voice. Angie only ever called me Michael when she was with Rose.

""A little rattled. I got some sleep but had a terrible nightmare.""

""You don't sound so good, pizza was a bad call?""

""No hon, pizza is great. Listen-"" I could hear movement in the living room. I lurched my body out and could see Felony playing with one of her toys. Her temperament was solid, so I felt safe for the moment. ""I have to go for a bit of a drive, I gotta go up north about an hour to the other call center, since I left early they wanted me to head over and check on some things with the new employees."" It was a shitty lie, but I needed something.

""This late at night?"" My wife saw through it immediately.

""Yeah, it's *because* I left early that they're making me do it. The other team leads that could be available don't have access to a car, I'm the only one that does."" I fucking sucked at lying.

""Well, alright then. Hey, save some pizza for Rose. I wanna give her a small bite to see what she thinks.""

""I only had a single slice before falling back asleep, there's plenty left.""

""Okay, say bye to daddy Rosie!"" Angie put the phone up to rose on speaker. I could hear the beautiful babbling of my living daughter. I wept, the beauty of my living child and her cooing voice comforted me.

""Bye honey, daddy will be home late tonight! Be good for your mom!"" We said our goodbyes, and I silently prayed for Rose.

I couldn't let this thing near her.

Something had to be done.

I cursed the weather, as it grew tumultuous on the drive toward her resting place. A rainfall began no sooner did I leave my apartment. I said a possible final goodbye to Felony, and left a note for Angela. I admitted everything, told her about Veronica, of who she knew, but also the unborn daughter of whom I buried hastily, that she did not know about.

The image still vexed me, the unborn girl who was never meant to be. Though I didn't hear her cries as I drove, the thunder-crash and lightning gave all the pageantry of her misery. I couldn't be certain that my plan would work, though I had to try.

In my hasty preparation on my way to the end at the beginning, I searched the internet for curses. Any sort of malignant power, anything related to harm done to children. Aside from the biblical threat from Jesus Christ Himself warning me of the fate of gnashing teeth and great weeping I would receive for my transgressions I found a single hit.

Poroniec.

The word was Slavic in origin, and belonged to a subset of Scandanavian folklore that related to the mistreatment of unbirthed children. I didn't know what *she* was, but she certainly had been mistreated all those years ago.

I would give her a proper burial, hopefully appeasing her.

Eventually, I reached the same hairpin turn which once held a fallen tree. Though it was a few years since our crash, I could still see area of the forest the mustang had ruined. There was an overgrowth, but nothing I couldn't navigate. I had a flashlight clipped to my hi visibility overcoat, as well as reflective tape to help mark my passageway back to my car.

Before I could make my way down the precarious embankment toward my destination, a horrible screech of tires and crash of metal interrupted any thoughts I had. Though I believed I had pulled over far enough, the rain caused visibility to be poor, and as such a tractor trailer slammed into my car. The resulting aftershock launched me over the guard rail, and I tumbled headfirst into a thicket of darkness.

A familiar sensation overtook me as I fell. I could see the past as it had happened, I felt all the rolls of the mustang I was once in match this future that I had yet to experience. I could see Veronica, panicking in the car, holding onto her belly. Despite all things I had believed, it relieved me to see her in her last moments show love to the child we could have had. I felt my body strike something with a wet *thud* and I passed out.

I woke, an unknown amount of time later. The rain was still falling, though not as harshly. I sucked wind and checked my body for injuries. My ankle was twisted completely around, the pain was indescribable. Like one thousand tiny knives all cut it at once, from every angle. I checked my flashlight, relieved to see it still worked. Through the murky bramble of wet and autumn leaves, I was shocked to see the site of our crash.

I wasn't sure if I should thank God or curse Him.

I stood, weakly, looking for a branch to help support my weight, luckily there were thick enough sticks I could cobble together a makeshift crutch. Hobbling my way to where I had buried her, or at least where I thought I had buried her, I could see a disturbance in the ground.

It had been years, but I was prepared in the event wildlife had got to her. Digging up the hastily dug grave I once had created for her, I found small lumps of viscera which I assumed to be remnants of my little girl. I cried, thinking of Rose. What a fate that could have been hers. Would I bury her like this too? How could I have been so uncaring?

The task at hand, with pain and blood slowly ebbing from my wounded ankle, I resolved to make things right. I took whatever discarded rotted lumps of meat that were within the hole and wrapped them from a piece of my garment. I reburied them and used two sticks to mark the grave site. I prayed the Lord's Prayer, weeping through the verses. My breathing had become ragged. I removed the flashlight from my coat and re-examined myself. I could feel a piercing pain in my abdomen, as the rain still fell, it was hard to see what was wrong, but I wasn't sure I would have much more time to do what needed to be done. I finished the grave, scrawling her name into the cross of sticks. My ruined fingernails and broken body finally sighed as I finished with her name.

*Anna*.

My work was completed. I leaned back, against the closest tree to the grave. Terror overcame me again as the same putrescent creature in Rose's bed crawled from just beyond the gloom in the forest. It was still frightfully deformed, and repulsive to look at. The rain pinging against its broken body made it shudder. For the first time since I laid eyes upon the creature, I felt pity. What sort of father could leave his daughter alone, in such a condition. I swallowed, tears welling up in my eyes.

""Anna. Come here, come sit with your father."" If it could be called a 'smile' the multiple rows of teeth all at once twisted into a childlike grin. It didn't hurry toward me, but crawled with a hastened speed. The smell of it was unbearable, the rotted flesh of a carcass mixed with spoiled meat. The prehensile tongue came out and licked one of the glassy yellow eyes, bulging from its horrible face. The crying began to disappear. A strange cooing noise emerged from the creature, from Anna. No longer was I plagued by its caterwauling. My heart felt at ease, and my body less heavy.

""I did you wrong Anna, but no more. I've marked where I left you, and I've named you. I will always love you, just as much as Rose. I did this for her, and for you."" I wasn't sure if she could understand me, but the unsettling fetal monstrosity looked and listened to what I had to say. If it could comprehend me, I hoped that my words reached it. I felt as though I was forgiven. The mottled beast, my unborn daughter Anna, closed its murky eyes and began to snore, near the wound in my abdomen.

""I'm sorry."" Was the last thing I said, as I stroked her coarse skin atop her head. Soon, everything went dark, and I fell away into a void.

They found me a day later, half starved and bleeding out. This was due to the letter I left my wife. I don't recall many questions, though I was in no condition to answer any of them. I believe one of the responding EMT's asked me *'Who's Anna?'.* I just laughed.

Couldn't he see?

I was later committed, as I felt I was thoroughly unwell. It was mostly my choice, which Angie and Clyde respected. I told them about what I had experienced.

They didn't believe me. Not many did.

They still visited me regularly, Angie remarried after a few years. Rose grew into a fine young woman, and she still called me dad. I told her to be mindful of her mother, and listen to her step-father. Rose would tell me all about her school, her grades, boys she liked. It was a sense of normalcy, though nothing could ever truly be normal again. Her sister was often upset that I never introduced her, but I told her time and time again Rose wasn't ready yet.

Clyde would visit from time to time. He looked at me as though I was a caged animal. Despite his wariness, Clyde listened to what I had to say and believed me when I told him about Anna.

He asked me what Anna looked like.¬†

I had attempted to draw her once, from my memory, foggy as it was. Every time I put pen to paper the image wouldn't look quite right. The doctors who had approved my drawings deemed me unfit for re-entry. I soon stopped trying to explain what I could see, or who was there if only to be left alone to my own devices.

But Anna was with me. Her many rows of teeth and mottled skin. Her beautiful glassy eyes and prehensile tongue, which would affectionately bathe me in kisses whenever I returned to my cot, in the room I was allowed. She was a good girl, I was glad that I had her. Her angelic wings would spread out and cover us while we napped together.

I loved her, and rocked her to sleep nightly, ensuring she never cried again.

My precious daughter.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the right area rug goes beyond just color and pattern. The features of a rug directly impact its durability, comfort, and overall suitability for your space. Here, we delve into the key features you should consider when choosing a black and gray area rug.**Material Composition:** Understanding the materials used in a rug is crucial for assessing its durability and feel. Many black and gray area rugs are made from synthetic fibers like polypropylene, which is known for its stain resistance and affordability. Others are crafted from natural fibers like wool or cotton, offering a softer feel and a more luxurious look. The choice depends on your budget, lifestyle, and desired level of maintenance. wool rugs, for instance, are highly durable and naturally stain-resistant but require professional cleaning.

**Pile Height and Density:** The pile height refers to the length of the fibers, while density refers to how tightly packed the fibers are. A high pile rug feels plush and pleasant underfoot but can be more challenging to clean, notably in high-traffic areas. Conversely, a low pile rug is easier to maintain and less prone to shedding. For homes with pets or children, a low to medium pile with a dense weave is generally recommended to withstand wear and tear and simplify cleaning.

**Construction Method:** Area rugs are typically constructed using one of several methods,including machine-made,hand-tufted,or hand-knotted. Machine-made rugs are generally the most affordable and consistent in quality, while hand-tufted rugs offer a more handcrafted look at a mid-range price point. Hand-knotted rugs are the most expensive and time-consuming to produce, resulting in a unique and durable product.Understanding the construction method helps you assess the rug's craftsmanship and longevity.

**Size and Shape Options:** The size and shape of your area rug is crucial for defining the space and creating a cohesive look within your room. Black and gray area rugs are available in a wide range of sizes, from small accent rugs to large room-sized carpets. Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and runner. Before purchasing a rug, carefully measure your space and consider the placement of furniture. A rug that is too small can make the room feel disjointed, while one that is too large can overwhelm the space.

Key features to look for in black and gray area rugs include:

*   Durable, stain-resistant materials.
*   Appropriate pile height and density for your lifestyle and needs.*   High-quality construction for longevity.
*   A variety of size and shape options to fit your space.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality black and gray area rug offers several core benefits, enhancing both the aesthetic appeal and functionality of your living space. These rugs are not just decorative; they provide comfort,protection,and contribute to a healthier home environment.**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A black and gray area rug can dramatically transform the look and feel of a room. Its neutral color palette provides a sophisticated and versatile backdrop that complements a wide range of furniture styles and color schemes. For instance, pairing a black and gray rug with bold-colored furniture creates a striking contrast, while using it with neutral tones results in a calming and cohesive aesthetic. The rug becomes an anchor, tying together the various elements in the room and creating a polished and intentional design.

**Improved Comfort and Sound Absorption:** Area rugs add a layer of warmth and comfort to hard flooring, making your home more inviting and cozy. Walking on a rug is far more pleasant than walking on cold, hard tile or wood. Additionally, area rugs can substantially reduce noise levels in a room by absorbing sound waves. This is particularly beneficial in apartments or homes with open floor plans, where noise can easily travel. The soft fibers of the rug dampen echoes and create a more peaceful and comfortable living environment.

**Floor Protection and Safety:** Area rugs provide a protective barrier between your furniture and flooring, preventing scratches, dents, and other damage. this is especially important for hardwood floors,which are susceptible to scratches from chair legs or heavy objects.moreover,area rugs can improve safety by providing traction and preventing slips and falls. This is especially useful in areas with slippery floors, such as kitchens or bathrooms. A strategically placed rug can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and create a safer home environment.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right area rug can be daunting, with many factors to consider. Here are some frequently asked questions to guide you through the process of selecting a black and gray area rug.

**What size rug should I get for my living room?**
the ideal rug size for a living room depends on the size of the room and the furniture arrangement. Generally, a rug should be large enough to anchor the main seating area, with the front legs of the sofa and chairs resting on the rug. A common rule of thumb is to leave about 12 to 18 inches of bare floor around the perimeter of the room. For smaller living rooms, a rug that fits entirely under the coffee table may suffice.

**How do I clean a black and gray area rug?**
The cleaning method depends on the rug's material and construction. For most synthetic rugs, regular vacuuming and spot cleaning with a mild detergent and water are sufficient. Wool rugs require more careful handling and should be professionally cleaned to avoid damage. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.Avoid using harsh chemicals or excessive water, as these can damage the rug's fibers.

**Are black and gray rugs suitable for high-traffic areas?**
Yes, black and gray rugs are generally suitable for high-traffic areas, especially those made from durable, stain-resistant materials like polypropylene or nylon. A low to medium pile rug with a dense weave is recommended for these areas,as it is easier to clean and less prone to shedding.Darker colors, such as black and gray, also tend to hide dirt and stains more effectively than lighter colors.

1mfewbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1mfewbp/caffeine_is_a_hell_of_a_drug/,Caffeine is a hell of a drug.,"I just need to vent about the fucking coffee-induced emotional roller coaster I just got off. 

I‚Äôm on day 2 of my period, and as per usual, I feel like fucking trash, cognitively, emotionally, and physically. The worst symptom is the physical and cognitive fatigue. Like, I‚Äôve taken THREE naps today, and trying to think clearly feels like wading through mud. I haven‚Äôt been able to do any work today, and even doing a single load of laundry was literally painful. I keep making mistakes like leaving the fridge open, dropping things, losing things I just hand in my hand, etc. 

So, I made a pot of coffee to stop napping and to get myself off the couch. I am well aware of the negative effects of caffeine on hormonal symptoms, but I was desperate to feel better (oh, the irony) and stay awake. And lo and behold, mere minutes after having a large cup of coffee, I suddenly felt so overwhelmed with feelings that I had to sit down. As soon as I sat down, I IMMEDIATELY burst into tears. I tried to breathe through it to calm down, but I felt completely out of control of my breath, which sent me into a panic attack. The insane thing is that there were NO emotional triggers, and I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about anything as I was sobbing other than ‚Äúwhy the fuck is this happening to me?!‚Äù 

Honestly, my life is going better than it has been in years, I have an IUD, and I‚Äôm even medicated to help with PMDD symptoms. It was the fucking caffeine and nothing else. And it‚Äôs a catch fucking 22 because I needed the caffeine to just to stave off a FOURTH nap. Nevertheless, I guarantee you i won‚Äôt be able to sleep tonight because of how late I had caffeine. I fucking hate this. 

I was able to calm down about 30 minutes ago, but now.. my skin is tingling? Even my lips are tingling. I feel fucking crazy you guys. And I‚Äôm still so exhausted.

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck to play on the go or in loving room tv.

1mfepds,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1mfepds/jars_are_dumb_how_to_fix_em/,"Jars are dumb, how to fix em.","Always have been. Why the hell could we craft perfect glass jars, metal lid and all with a little sand and no extra tools? Why is there an endless supply of random jars that manifest themselves inside the dew collector? Total. Immersion. Killers.

But why aren't there reusable water bottles? Canteens? Jugs? Gallons? Thermos! Frickin yeti cups man!?

You should be able to refill those and carry them with you an entire playthrough! If you so choose. They can make inventory management easier and tougher at the same time 

But you can craft 5000 jars and never worry about water again is just the most sorry excuse I have ever heard from someone on the team of people who can control how much of something you can carry/store of anything at any given moment. 

But folks, I do not only have gripes. I bring with me solutions too! 

Some ideas for you to entertain: 
1. Reduce stack size. You can only carry or store 8 jars or less in one slot. But they are refillable and hold a number of drinks per jar, like 2. You could even add icon tiers to show how much water is in a stack of jars. A pile of jars with varying amounts of water in each jar, illustrated in a dynamic icon. 
-very gamey, but hey that's what this is. A game. Not a next gen survival simulator as the team has very decidedly shown us with its direction. 

2. (My favorite) Make 1 drink container take up an entire slot, but hold varying amounts of fluid, and add tiers of containers. Plastic bottle > gallon jug > Canteen > thermos? Idk about what goes where but making tiers of containers adds to your progression and makes looting worth while for better containers you can't craft to hold more liquid for further traveling. 
-bonus you can let containers hold different liquids! Got a Canteen of beer, a plastic bottle of Yucca juice, and a Gallon jug of water, thermos of coffee. 
-frickin mod your bottles dudes. Nipple top for faster drinking! Add a water filter to just fill with murky and go! I'm sure a think tank can drum up more but thats some potential! 
-adds so much immersion (imo)

3. (Kinda lame but I'll take it) give us jars back as plastic bottles, make 'em uncraftable but refillable at lakes, dew collectors and such. Dew collectors then should produce water that can't be collected without a container to put it in, but can drink directly from it (still murky water).

Keep the dew collector. It makes sense, in a way, but why do we need some many? You should have one, and it should have a tank of water that you can fill your containers from, like in real life. Not have it produce fixed water units in magic glass jars.  
All you did was take the 'jar problem' and make us put it on the map. Instead of crafting 5000 jars and never worrying about water players are crafting 50 dew collectors and never worrying about water, but are worrying about screamers. 
If someone doesn't want to worry about water, they arent gonna. The people who made 5000 jars are the same people who will make 50 dew collectors. Thought not everyone plays the game that way, but we get treated like everyone does.

Why? 

Why to a lot of your choices FunPimps. What are you trying to make for us? What is your final goal? What is the meal you are trying to serve us? I am not in the kitchen, nor am I cooking. I ordered my meal ticket a while ago an have just watched you trim things. Rather than add anything, youve streamlined the same ol' portions of meat and trimmed ""fat"" that many people werent complaining about, and would argue wasnt ""fat"" at all. And when you did ""add"" something, you asked for more money.

I could keep ranting. I miss Learning by Doing. I miss the old clothing system. Smoothies? Really?? I mean hey, it's unique that is for sure. But it's also so, so lame. In my opinion. Other might very well think it's the coolest thing ever, but I just don't see it. 

But all of this is just one guys opinion. Or it would be if I was writing this in a journal, but I wanna talk about it, at least a little, with other people who have invested time and money into where this thing goes. 

I don't hate TheFunPimps. I don't hate 7DTD. 
I appreciate every hour of the fun time with friends this game has given me.

This isn‚Äôt much & may be well known but I wanted to post this here for those that may not know or have tried this!! My onion and garlic allergy really get in the way of a lot, to the point I feel like I‚Äôm missing out sometimes for sure. My mom and I have done a ton of research and most of the replacements for seasons and stuff still have other things I‚Äôm deathly allergic to so after a while of trial and error of making a lot of things by hand- we came across some pretty good substitutes for onion and garlic. 

Ground fennel seeds & celery salt (for either or both)  

I grind fennel seeds in a coffee grinder to make powder or use them whole if needed

Both of these work so good in main dishes where garlic & onion are always used together or in homemade ranch powder. There definitely is adjustment/difference if you‚Äôre used to the other but I‚Äôve genuinely found for me if I‚Äôm eating them in something and not just taste testing the spice it works so well. I feel like I get to have dips, dressings and seasoning options back now!

Also I‚Äôve found if you can‚Äôt use chilli powder because it has garlic powder in it, usually (check the ingredients) but ancho chili powder is free of allium products! And it helps when I can use that for Chili & things instead.

Lastly fennel bulb chopped or celery chopped make a really great replacement for onion in dishes if you still want something with a similar feel to saute/add crunch, etc!

I don‚Äôt know if this will help anyone but finding these things really helped me. 

Oh and P.S. if you are missing strong flavors in general bc of allium allergy- I find sometimes fresh ginger or horseradish can help put some razzle dazzle back into dishes (if the vibe fits of course)",1,1754099923.0,Alliumproblems,0,1.0,False

I'm currently facing a dilemma: I'm about to buy my first espresso machine and grinder (I've already decided on the machine), but choosing the grinder is a bit tricky. I‚Äôm not considering expensive options, so I focused on manual grinders first.

Among the ones I liked is the Timemore C3 ESP, but recently they released the C5 ESP, and now I'm thinking about that one - it has more adjustment steps for espresso, but from what I‚Äôve read, the grinding process is a bit slower due to the larger size and more resistance.

The downside of manual grinders is that grinding can be tiring and time-consuming - after that, you might not even want the coffee anymore, lol. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm also looking into electric grinders from Timemore.

I'm currently considering:

- Timemore Whirly 01S

- DF54 (yes, is more expensive ‚Äî but still worth considering)


However, I‚Äôve seen a few comments that it might be difficult to get a replacement battery or parts for the Whirly 01S, which is a concern. So.. I‚Äôm trying to find a balance between price, build quality, and speed.

Let me summarize my questions:

1) How exhausting and time-consuming is grinding for espresso with manual grinders like the C3 ESP or C5 ESP?

2) How hard is it to replace the burrs or battery on Timemore grinders, especially the Whirly 01S?

3) Is it worth paying extra for something like the DF54 for better speed and convenience, or is Whirly/manual still the smarter choice for a beginner?

4) Is it really difficult to find spare parts/ battery..for Timemore grinders?


Sorry for the long post - I hope my questions make sense, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance! ",0,1754099648.0,pourover,5,0.5,False

1mfeihn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mfeihn/i_am_scared_of_my_little_brother/,I am scared of my little brother,"I (F) am scared of my younger brother (16M).
My younger brother is adopted which I include only because I believe it is relevant to this. He was adopted very young but still spent a couple years with his bio parents but was adopted young.

He is very violent, impulsive, secretive, etc and has been since he was very young. As a kid he tried to drown our cat once and shot another cat with a pop gun toy. My parents tried to socialize him before school through daycare but everyday was a list of bad things he did that day (one of the most notable being that he broke a little girl's collarbone).

He lied about literally everything as a kid and didn't care what hurt it caused. When my brother started middle school he was destructive and violently attacked another kid at which point we removed him from school and enrolled him in a homeschool program on a device we had attempted to lock so he could only access that.


My brother also has a huge fixation on weapons so we don't allow any around him but he always find a way. He is obsessed to a worrying degree. worrying degree. For example, my mom left to go to the cemetery a few years back and my brother snuck out to the shed and stole a knife from my dad's tackle box and hid it under his mattress. My dad found it after we kept having money go missing. It turns out he was also stealing our prescription meds. None are even meds someone could really get high off of, he just took them because he could. We added reinforced locks to all doors in the house so he couldnt take things from us. One point I was in the hospital and hadn't locked it and he stole money from me.

He continuously did bad things to us and we were unable to find a psychiatric facility to take him so we enrolled him in a very good military school program because we had heard positive things from people who went there. (It basically has stuff you would expect in a military school like early wake ups and routine and stuff but with an added bonus of fun trips and things). While there he made a weapon and was caught with it .
My dad took him to a hospital for psychiatric hold. They found a place finally to take him but the place had to hire extra male staff to work overnight because my brother repeatedly attacked female staff. Eventually the place sent him home and we were told there's really nothing that can he done until he kills someone. He also admits to abusing our dogs.

I was home alone with him one night a few months back while my parents were with friends at a concert and they don't get to go out often. I checked on him and then showered and came to check on him again at which point he tells me he drank some nyquil and four cups of coffee which is strange because he usually doesn't tell what he does and tries to hide it. He had punched a hole in his wall and told me it was because he missed our dad who he doesn‚Äôt like and is later ranting about how much he hates him. I usually don't point out when he does stuff like that because it just makes him mad but I did for some reason. I think he doesn't like when manipulation doesn't really work. And he got this really scary look in his eyes that I can't explain and started shaking very violently and punched the couch beside my head really hard. He is taller than me and a lot stronger than me and I was scared. I can't explain it but I just had a feeling in that moment that he was gonna kill me. I ran outside and called my older brother and SIL who don't live far and they came over. Eventually we go in and my older brother points out the same flaw in his logic and my younger brother gets in a physical fight with him where my younger brother is trying to attack him while my older brother is trying to get him contained in his room.

My parents come home and my younger brother gets that look in his eye again and tries to attack our dad. Me, my mom, my older brother, and my SIL are all trying to hold him back but can't. He says he's going to kill our dad. We manage to hold him down finally and call 911 and he is on this rant about how he oughta be able to do what he wants and how there's nothing wrong with him. The cops come and take him in an ambulance and tell us the same thing people keep telling us that nobody will really do anything.
We tried really hard to find another place to send him and everyone kept saying there's nothing unless he is in state custody because facilities have to have open slots for kids in state custody so my parents went through that process. He went to another place and attacked multiple kids and was sent to juvie.

He is now is a new facility and advancing through the program despite failing drug tests and still doing things. He sends letters that are basically catered to what he thinks each of us want to hear (I can't explain it). But he isn't getting help here just lying his way through. He will be sent home eventually without help and I truly believe he will kill someone. I am afraid of him and feel like a prisoner in my own home. This is just a handful of incidents from a lifetime of interactions like this and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been in a similar situation?

The last time we hung out, I took her out for dinner, stayed up until the small hours of the morning just talking in bed, and hung out all morning and got coffee until she went home at 1pm. It was an amazing vibe, great connection. We had a blast.

During that hang, I told her I was into her and that I like hanging out and want to keep hanging out. She said she does as well, but the thought of anything serious freaks her out. I told her I wasn‚Äôt insinuating that (true) and that I‚Äôm just enjoying these moments and only raised this because I want to be in the same page about continuing to hang. She said she wants to keep going as we have been. Opened up about her past relationship a bit. And thanked for making her feel safe and comfortable. I get the sense she‚Äôs cautious with her emotions currently. But I am happy to move slowly, as I prefer that anyway. I don‚Äôt rush.

The thing is, her text communication is so shit. Like sometimes more than 24 hours to reply. It‚Äôs not rare that she will take a while. Last text her nearly 24 hours ago, and although I hate to say it, it makes me feel anxious. It makes me feel like she‚Äôs not that interested. Makes me doubt myself and the connection we have so far.

1mfehpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1mfehpw/worst_day_serving/,Worst Day Serving,"Today I had the WORST shift I‚Äôve ever had. Truly idk what happened and why it was so bad. I‚Äôve had busier days, days where the kitchen was much more of a mess and my coworkers were much more of a drag.

We knew coming in that it was going to be rough, we have been short servers and we only had 6 (one of them being fresh off training and only allowed 2 tables). I work at a breakfast restaurant and the way ours is set up we have ‚Äúsides‚Äù so on one side they had 3 servers and broke it into 3 sections and on our side we had 3 servers broken into 3 sections. Normally on Friday‚Äôs we have 9 servers (we only need 8 really but 9 are scheduled in case of a call in). This really shouldn‚Äôt have been a huge deal because we are a relatively small location and I‚Äôve run one side of the restaurant with just me and another strong server before completely smoothly. 

However, today was a disaster. On our side, the fresh server had her two tables, I had only 6 (so seriously not even that bad I‚Äôve certainly juggled more!) and the other server (a head server) had 9. 

The new girl was struggling and required a lot of hand holding, had a lot of questions, didn‚Äôt know her plates and struggled to run her food, was ringing things in wrong and not checking on her tables enough or prepping things like coffee and condiments. The head server was struggling too, she had multiple walkouts from tables she couldn‚Äôt get to. 

For myself, I really felt like I was doing okay, I was overwhelmed when the rush started and I got quadruple sat but I was managing and THEN my fifth table completely threw me off and that‚Äôs when my crash out began. They started off as a 4 top. Got their drinks and order in. Then they were like ‚Äúactually we have two more coming‚Äù and they wanted me to grab coffee for them so I did, messed with my flow a little but no biggie nothing is ever completely smooth right? But after I go to drop off the coffee this lady is on the phone with the other guests (and now it‚Äôs a party of seven she informs me and wants a chair added to the end of the table which is meant for only six) she has me stand there and explain the weekday deals we have to her (okay no biggie right?) and then she explains it to the person she‚Äôs on the phone with and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúAlrighty! I‚Äôll be back in just a bit to get that order from you‚Äù because at this point I‚Äôve been sat with another table and need to greet them and get drinks. And she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo, no! I‚Äôm ready now let me put their order in.‚Äù But proceeds to explain and debate with the person on the phone what they should order and then wants to make substitutions and I explain kindly that we can‚Äôt make substitutions on the deals and then she‚Äôs going on trying to decide what to put in for the other guests for I kid you NOT 5 minutes! And we all know how important 5 minutes is! 

I finally get the rest of their order in and am able to go greet my other table, grab drinks and get their order and now I need to start running those other tables food out to them but the rest of the problem tables party has arrived and they want juices NOW. So I prep a tray with glasses for them and refills for my other tables that I can see need refills, I run two tables food, then come back finish the drinks, then run the rest of my food and at this point the problem tables food is ready so I run that next and they don‚Äôt like their eggs, they say they are dry. No biggies except my manager is in the kitchen and truly I love him he‚Äôs a great manager and very understanding when I have to call in because of sick kids and always approves my requests for time off BUT when you ask for a remake he makes you go take the food of their plate and show it to him and then tries to blame anyone else for whatever the problem with the food is instead of just fixing it. Like I literally do not CARE who‚Äôs at fault when there is a food issue I just need it remade how the customer wants so I have a happy table. 

So their remake for scrambled eggs takes a ridiculous amount of time because I have to advocate for a remake first! At this point I‚Äôm just completely in the weeds. Tables need to check out, my manager is also yelling that he needs runners, when food is missing or wrong he argues and is generally a jerk about it and I‚Äôm like IM LITERALLY TRYING TO HELP YOU?? You say I‚Äôm one of your strong servers? I stg I wanted to quit! I‚Äôve never had a day like this where I literally wanted to just cry and walk away. Screw it all. 

Genuinely now I‚Äôm like maybe I need to work harder on getting out of this industry sooner, because I‚Äôm currently in school and intend to go to law school but maybe I should get certified as a paralegal or something so I can be free from arguing with people about freaking eggs! That‚Äôs another thing normally I can calm myself down and be like ‚Äúit‚Äôs just breakfast literally who cares‚Äù because I‚Äôm the grand scheme of things this all is just NOT a big deal but today it overcame me.

Ugh it‚Äôs just also embarrassing and I feel like I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúgood‚Äù server. As if I have to be perfect all the time and have perfect customers to be on the list of ‚Äústrong servers‚Äù. Idk I just really needed to rant with people who get it! Whoever got this far thank you for listening to my probably jumbled nonsense.

TLDR: Table held me hostage while they ordered for their other guests coming in while on the phone with them and it threw me into the weeds. ",4,1754099420.0,Serverlife,2,0.84,False

# Best Outdoor Bean Bag 2025: Top Reviews & Guide

The outdoor bean bag has evolved from a simple novelty item to a serious contender in outdoor furniture. These versatile seating options offer comfort,style,and durability,making them perfect for patios,decks,poolside lounging,or even taking to the beach. With an increasing number of brands and models available, choosing the right outdoor bean bag can be a daunting task. This guide aims to provide comprehensive reviews and buying advice to help you find the best outdoor bean bag for your needs in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

Outdoor bean bags are not created equal. The best models boast a combination of durable materials, agreeable fillings, and practical design elements.

**Weather-Resistant Fabric:** A critical feature is the fabric's ability to withstand the elements. Look for materials like solution-dyed acrylic (e.g., Sunbrella), marine-grade vinyl, or durable polyester with a waterproof coating.These fabrics are resistant to fading, mildew, water damage, and wear and tear from UV exposure. The ideal fabric should have a high UV resistance rating and be easy to clean, frequently enough with just soap and water.

**Durable Construction and Stitching:** The quality of the stitching and overall construction plays a vital role in the bean bag's longevity. Reinforced seams, double stitching, and sturdy zippers are essential to prevent rips and tears, especially under heavy use. Check for reviews that mention the product's ability to withstand weight and maintain it's shape over time. Look at the denier rating of the fabric: higher denier indicates a denser, more durable material.

**Fill Material:** The type of fill material considerably impacts comfort and support. Conventional bean bags use polystyrene (EPS) beads,which are lightweight and conform to the body.However, EPS beads can compress over time. Some high-end outdoor bean bags use a shredded memory foam blend, which offers superior support and retains its shape longer. Consider the fill volume as well; a fuller bean bag will provide better support and prevent the user from sinking too far.**Waterproof Inner Liner:** A waterproof inner liner is crucial to protect the fill material from moisture. This prevents mold and mildew growth and ensures the bean bag remains usable even after getting wet. The liner should be made of a durable,non-porous material that can withstand wear and tear. check if the liner is removable or replaceable for easy maintenance and cleaning.

**Portability and weight:** While some bean bags are designed for stationary use, others are made to be easily portable for picnics, camping, or trips to the beach.Consider the weight and size of the bean bag, and also whether it has handles or straps for easy carrying. Lighter bean bags filled with EPS beads are generally more portable than heavier models filled with memory foam.

**UV Resistance:** Exposure to UV radiation can cause many materials to fade, crack, or otherwise degrade. Bean bags advertised as UV-resistant treat fabrics with chemicals to resist this damage. Look for details about any additional UV-resistance coatings on the bags.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality outdoor bean bag offers numerous benefits that enhance your outdoor living experience.**unmatched Comfort and Relaxation:** Outdoor bean bags conform to your body, providing customized support and unparalleled comfort. Whether you're lounging by the pool, reading a book on the patio, or simply relaxing in the sun, the bean bag's ergonomic design promotes relaxation and reduces pressure points. Users report increased comfort compared to traditional patio furniture, resulting in longer and more enjoyable outdoor sessions. This is especially ideal for individuals with back pain or those seeking a more relaxed seating option.

**Versatile Seating Options:** Unlike traditional outdoor furniture,bean bags are incredibly versatile. They can be easily moved around to accommodate different seating arrangements or activities.

The portability allows for easy relocation of the furniture to areas shaded as the sun moves across the sky.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right outdoor bean bag involves considering several factors. Here are some answers to common questions:

**Are outdoor bean bags truly waterproof?**
while most outdoor bean bags are water-resistant, not all are fully waterproof. Water-resistant fabrics repel water and prevent it from easily soaking through, but they can still become saturated after prolonged exposure to heavy rain. Look for bean bags with a waterproof inner liner to protect the fill material from getting wet. Some bean bags are made with fully waterproof materials and sealed seams, making them completely impervious to water.

**How do I clean and maintain my outdoor bean bag?**
Cleaning and maintaining your outdoor bean bag is relatively simple. For minor spills and stains, wipe the fabric with a damp cloth and mild soap. For deeper cleaning, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Many outdoor bean bag covers are removable and machine washable. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as they can damage the fabric. Store your bean bag in a dry,shaded area when not in use to prolong its lifespan.**Can I replace the fill in my outdoor bean bag?**
Yes, most outdoor bean bags allow you to replace the fill. Over time, the fill material may compress, causing the bean bag to lose its shape and support. You can purchase replacement fill from most retailers that sell bean bags. The fill can usually be easily replaced by opening the bean bag‚Äôs zipper and pouring in new fill as required. Follow the instructions on the fill package for more specific details.

**What size of outdoor bean bag is right for me?**
The ideal size of your outdoor bean bag depends on your intended use and available space.Smaller bean bags (around 3-4 feet in diameter) are suitable for individual use or for children. Larger bean bags (5 feet or more in diameter) are better for adults or for couples who want to lounge together. Consider the footprint of the bean bag and make sure it fits comfortably in your outdoor space without obstructing walkways or other furniture.

1mfee7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1mfee7d/hit_a_wall_advice_needed/,Hit a wall. [Advice Needed],"A little over 3 months ago I made a post here how I'd moved to the other side of the world to start my media publishing company.

No job. No income. Pretty much no safety net.

And I'd been building and going at it every day, with pretty much no breaks. Out of the 3 1/2 months I'd been working on this, I've maybe took 6 or 7 days off total (4 of which was to go on a short trip with my girlfriend).

I thought I was in a super productive routine, always motivated to show up to a new coffee shop, just sit down and black out for 8-10 hours.

But for the past 10 days, I feel like I hit a huge wall. I can't keep my focus for more than 3 hours, I space out, and it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a force in me that¬†actively resists¬†doing the thing I¬†know¬†I have to do.

I thought I was just overwhelmed with the amount of tasks and created an entire roadmap for the next 3 months, so that all of my planning and thinking it outsourced to an external document, and I could dedicate my entire time to just executing.

Nothing.

I don't know how to explain it better, but it's like my nervous system is in a permanent state of ‚Äúf - this‚Äù even though my brain is saying ‚Äúthis is exactly what you signed up for.‚Äù Like my energy‚Äôs being drained by the¬†idea¬†of work before I even start.

I¬†care about the topic I started my publishing site in (I mean, I quit looking for a job, and moved to the other side of the world for this). It's not some random churn and burn site with zero passion behind it.

I tried everything - brain dumping, productivity hacks, building said roadmap, apps.

I'm not sure what I'm looking to get out of posting this, but has else dealt with this kind of mind-body resistance before? What was it? What helped you break through?",2,1754099128.0,Entrepreneur,3,1.0,False

I remember it being a collection of fairy tales (I think all Hans Christian Andersen stories), and it had some beautifully detailed, mature or almost sensual illustrations that have stuck with me. Stories I remember being in the book include The Little Mermaid, The Princess and the Pea, one about a tin soldier missing a leg and his toy ballerina love, a Christmas tree that ends up getting burned in the fire after Christmas, and one about an emperor and a nightingale.

One image I specifically remember is from The Princess and the Pea, I think ‚Äî the princess comes in out of the rain, her clothes cling to her, and the water on her skin looks like jewels. I remember the illustrations of the other stories being equally beautiful but I can't remember enough specifics to be helpful. The tone of the illustrations was mature, capturing a sense of elegance and emotion, but it wasn‚Äôt meant to be sexual‚Äîjust a very sophisticated, evocative style that really stood out to me.

The book was likely from the '90s, and I think it had a white cover with illustrations from inside the book on it, similar to a couple collections I've seen from DK Books. The illustrations were colorful, rich and detailed, and sometimes wrapped around the text. The book itself was pretty large‚Äîalmost like a coffee table book but not too thick.

1mfecda,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mfecda/i_22m_spend_every_weekend_visiting_my/,"I [22M] spend every weekend visiting my long-distance girlfriend [20F], but I feel like I care more than she does","**Background:**

I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (20F) for about six months, and for the last two months, we‚Äôve been long distance after I graduated college. We‚Äôre about nine hours apart by car, or two hours by flight.

Pretty much every weekend since then, I‚Äôve been flying down Friday night, renting a car, driving an hour to her place, and getting a hotel nearby. I visit her on Saturday and Sunday, but I always have to leave by 10pm because her family has strict quiet hours and doesn‚Äôt want guests over late. I can‚Äôt stay the night, so after hanging out, I head back to my hotel.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed: every time I visit, I hint that I‚Äôd love to see her early (like 8 or 10am), but she always says she needs more sleep and doesn‚Äôt want me to come over until noon or 1pm. So I end up just sitting in my hotel or a coffee shop for a few hours, even though I‚Äôm there just to see her. We hang out for 8‚Äì9 hours, then I leave by 10pm. Same thing the next day.

**Here's the two scenarios that's really bothering me.**

There was one weekend a couple weeks ago where, on Sunday morning, she told me she had an outing with her friends that day. She didn‚Äôt mention it until the day of, so I ended up not seeing her most of Sunday. Honestly, that stung, because she‚Äôs a student, it‚Äôs summer, she doesn‚Äôt have work or classes, so why not schedule friend stuff during the week? We only get two days together, so it feels like she‚Äôs not really making the most of it, and not really respecting the time and money I spent to visit her.

Last weekend, I realized we weren‚Äôt even seeing each other on Fridays anyways, so I figured I‚Äôd just fly in Saturday instead of Friday. That way I‚Äôd save at least one night of hotel costs (\~150$), and tbh, I wanted to see if it made any difference. I booked a 6am flight, woke up super early, and got to her place around 9am. I‚Äôd told her the day before that I‚Äôd be there at 9. When I arrived and called, she didn‚Äôt answer a few times, so I just went to Starbucks and did some work for a few hours. She finally called me back at noon (she‚Äôd just woken up lol) and told me to come over then. Like I told her when I'd arrive and she didn't even bother setting an alarm?

I guess what‚Äôs getting to me is that I‚Äôm putting in a lot of effort here: waking up early, flying out, renting cars, booking hotels, and honestly, spending quite a bit just to make this work. If the roles were reversed, and she came to visit me, I‚Äôd wake up whenever she got there, no questions asked. It‚Äôs starting to weigh on me and I‚Äôm not sure how to move forward.

**I know the most common advice is to ‚Äúcommunicate, communicate, communicate,‚Äù but honestly, I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask my girlfriend to want to spend time with me. If I have to do that, does she even want to be my girlfriend?**

For anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation, how did you address feeling like you‚Äôre putting in more effort than your partner? How can I talk to her about this without sounding resentful or demanding? Is there a good way to balance wanting more time together while respecting her needs too? Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.

**TL;DR:**  
I (22M) travel every weekend to see my long-distance girlfriend (20F): waking up early, flying out, dealing with her family‚Äôs 10pm quiet hours, and making the trip work even when it means spending extra. She never wants to see me before noon, even when I fly in on a 6am flight, and sometimes makes other plans on the only days I‚Äôm there. Looking for advice on how to address this and communicate my feelings, or if this relationship is even worth salvaging.",3,1754098977.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

So, my store has been open around 3 years now, and me and one of my coworkers I'm very close with have been here since the beginning, I mean before the store was even fully built. Said coworker was hired to be a shift lead, having had previous experience managing a different coffee shop and doing a great job. Some other baristas (including me) even worked under them at the other coffee shop and heavily advocated for them to get this position.

Well, our first SM (fired abt 2 years ago), essentially told them after they had been hired that they couldn't be promoted due to their disability. They have CMT (muscular dystrophy affecting mainly their legs) and thus just need to maybe take a couple sit-downs throughout their shifts. SM quite literally said they ""wouldn't be able to"" despite my coworker saying that they absolutely could. 

Nothing ever came of the problems with the first SM, she was fired for unrelated reasons not too long after. We had a stand-in SM for a few months, so no one was even hired under her, let alone promoted. Now we've had a new SM for a little over a year, and he is essentially doing the same thing to them but without being so blatant. 

They've had several talks and been told a promotion is finally coming their way. Great! Except now, even though they keep being told that they'll be the next shift lead, it's been months. Several people that have worked here way less time have already been promoted. They haven't heard a word. Even put in several more applications for shift lead. Nothing. Been told they'll have an interview soon, only to be ghosted and never hear another word of it. No one will tell them a direct reason they can't be a shift lead. We all find that very suspicious, considering what they've been told about their disability in the past. 

They are loved by everyone, customers and partners alike ask when they'll be promoted. They even received partner of the quarter last time. It is very disheartening and honestly infuriating to watch this happen. What should we do? Reports have been filed on the SM countless times (many for unrelated but equally awful things I won't get into), and nothing ever happens. Our DM is all buddy-buddy with him and just doesn't seem to care at all about baristas. It's like screaming into the void trying to get any ounce of fairness in this God forsaken place. 

Anyone out there with similar experiences or advice on how to handle this? It's genuinely just like every SM has a nonsensical vendetta against this partner. It just feels too vague to officially blame it on discrimination since the SM has never directly said anything about their disability. Sorry for being so wordy lol, wanted to provide adequate context. I'm just at a loss here. Thanks to anyone who reads this or has a say. I just want them to get what they deserve, much love!

The run line (-1.5 for Seibu, +1.5 for Marines) and total (5.5 runs) also lean toward Seibu‚Äôs aggressive offense, which has scored 11 runs in a recent game against Chiba.

**News Digest: Roki Soto‚Äôs Worst Day and Seibu‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe Never Quit‚Äù T-Shirt**  
The Marines‚Äô starting pitcher, Roki Soto, had a performance soÊÉ® (ÊÉ® is Chinese for ‚ÄúÊÉ®,‚Äù which is Japanese for ‚ÄúÊÉ®,‚Äù both meaning ‚Äúmiserable‚Äù) that it makes a toddler‚Äôs first day of preschool look like a victory parade. His 8-run, 8-strikeout outing against Seibu last time out earned him a 7th loss and his manager‚Äôs side-eye. Manager Yoshii called it ‚Äúa rookie‚Äôs performance,‚Äù which is only slightly kinder than calling it ‚Äúthe day the coffee machine took over the mound.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the Seibu Lions are riding a wave of come-from-behind heroics. They‚Äôve rallied from deficits in multiple games this season, including a 7-2 comeback win against DeNA and that 11-2 dismantling of Chiba. Their offense? A well-oiled machine of home runs and timely doubles. Their defense? Well, they‚Äôve only given up 1 run in a game this year‚Äîaccording to their press release, anyway.

**Humorous Spin: The Marines Are Lost at Sea, and Seibu Is the Lighthouse**  
The Chiba Lotte Marines are currently sailing through baseball‚Äôs equivalent of a hurricane. Their 20-game deficit and 4-game losing streak make them the *Titanic* of NPB‚Äîsin

1mfe7nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mfe7nc/aita_for_standing_up_to_a_friend_who_blindsided/,"AITA for standing up to a friend who blindsided me, then blocking him after he ended our friendship?","I (26M) met this guy Charles last year in April at the library. We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I started noticing how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often turned into debates (even when they didn‚Äôt need to be) and he always needed to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

Fast forward to earlier this year, we got into a conversation about politics. He told me he a DJT supporter and asked about my views. I said I leaned liberal. His immediate response was, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs probably just because of your dad.‚Äù I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want to quantify it, but he kept pressing, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to assume a lot,‚Äù and then tried to argue that I actually agreed with him more than I realized. It didn‚Äôt feel like a discussion, it felt like a takedown.

The next day, I texted him to say I didn‚Äôt appreciate how he boxed me in about politics and made assumptions about me. I wasn‚Äôt trying to fight, I just wanted to express how it made me feel. He replied saying he doesn‚Äôt like texting and wanted to talk in person.

We met at Starbucks (I even bought him a coffee) and it all blew up. He went off, saying I was trying to bring him down to my level, that I have low self-esteem, that I‚Äôm controlling, untrustworthy, and that I ‚Äúlove conflict"" and that I sound like the devil. It was just one personal insult after another. I reminded him of all the ways I‚Äôve supported him‚Äînot to guilt-trip him, but to show I‚Äôve always been in his corner.

He ended the conversation by saying, ‚ÄúThis friendship is over,‚Äù and told me to get up and hug him. I declined but offered a handshake, which he took. Then he walked away.

After that, I sent him one final message and blocked him:  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel bad about myself, Charles, nor do I have low self-esteem. I‚Äôm okay the way I am‚Äîmaybe even better than others in some ways. This apology thing bothered you so much that you resorted to insults and bad words against my character. People make mistakes‚Äîeven you joke about it when it happens‚Äîbut today, you took it seriously in a way that felt unnecessary and cruel. I don‚Äôt want to be friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve that kind of treatment or disrespect. Ciao for now.‚Äù  
  
Since then, I‚Äôve stopped going to his church and haven‚Äôt had regular contact with him for seven months. Here‚Äôs where things get even weirder.

A few weeks ago, I noticed multiple random accounts adding me on **Snapchat** (bogus names that show they've just been created), and I strongly suspect it was him (or someone connected to him) trying to monitor me or bait me into contact. When I messaged one of them saying I knew who it was and ive contacted the authorities regarding this, I got 2 more adds then the adds stopped for 2 whole weeks.

Then more recently, I got a¬†**Facebook friend request**¬†from an account that was literally just created (it had only one photo of a woman and no mutual friends). I messaged it out of curiosity, and when I asked about the location on their profile being in another country, they said ""yeah thats how it is here"". It felt off. This ""girl"" also body claimed out of the blue that im ""scared of her personality"" when we've only exchanged like 2 messages prior. It‚Äôs purely speculative, but given the timing and context, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this too is connected to him or someone in his circle.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1mfe6c0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfe6c0,Recommendations for fixing a crack in this cedar coffee table top I built?,"Built this cedar coffee table top for a customer around a year and a half ago or so. They recently contacted me about repairing a crack that had formed. It‚Äôs not on the joints of the panel itself, but just happened to run through the sap wood. They would like a natural repair look. I feel I have a couple of options. 

1. I can use a combination of wood glue, and fine sap wood dust from my sander to bind the crack and match the color of the sap wood. 

2. I can use wood filler to match the wood and repair it that way. 

I believe glue would probably be the best to stop it from further cracking. Has anyone experimented with a mixture of wood glue, and wood filler? If so how did that work. Also I am not sure I want to clamp it and risk cupping the top in either direction since the top has been pre drilled for brackets that attach to the base. 

I also noticed the holes drilled for brackets done by the customer are running parallel along the long sides of the base of the coffee table, but there are none in the center. Could the crack have come from the piece over time bowing in the middle and cracking due to pressure of feet, or other objects sat on top of it? If so perhaps I recomend adding some brackets in the middle top to bottom? 

Cedar is brittle contrary wood, so hard to judge, and as always sometimes wood just has a mind of its own. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

So I'm an Ulta BA in New York State . I'm going to keep my specific area anonymous bc I'm a base level employee and I don't want to be penalized at all for making a few calls to get the word out about this issue because that is supposed to be the responsibility of management and I don't want to be penalized for ""overstepping"". 

Today my on duty manager opened up an email chain of a bunch of managers reporting that the new Sensitive skin Byoma body wash smelled like chemicals and gave customers a weird rash. So since it was dead at my store I went and pulled all the bottles off the shelf and brought them to the back. I sorted them by batch number and we had 4 different batches. My manager took a whiff and reacted as if she had just took a whiff of smelling salts. I honestly thought she was overreacting, so I took a huge whiff. As soon as it hit my nose it burned so bad that I blacked out for a sec and I had to blow my nose and huff the coffee beans for a bit to get rid of the smell. We then, with extreme caution, smelled the rest of the bottles and they all had the same offensively strong chemical smell. My manager told me that she thought it smelled like ammonia. So if it was ammonia in there that means that those rashes people were getting were probably chemical burns. And if there was enough of whatever was in there to burn the skin, imagine what could happen if it got in someone's eyes or was ingested. 

Without even thinking I immediately added it to the inventory adjustment list and marked it as out of stock. I then checked all of our packaged bopis orders to make sure no one was going to walk out of our store with a bottle. I figured my manager would reply to the email chain and would report this to corporate or contact the distribution center. I then went about my shift and didn't really check up on the situation. 

Fast forward to 5 hours after we discovered this. Im still kinda light headed from the smell. I'm clocked out and at home by this point so I figured I should see what came of the situation. NO STATEMENT FROM BYOMA. And the product is still available on the ULTA APP. 

This concerned me greatly. I admit, I panicked a bit that this product was still available for sale. I wasn't sure who to contact about this so I did call the Ulta customer service number and I did notify them about the situation. Unfortunately it seemed as tho the customer service rep was not taking my concerns seriously and I'm worried that nothing will come of me calling. 
 
In conclusion, please check all of your bottles of that product. 
I'm really hoping this reaches someone superior to me in the company so this situation can get handled. ",17,1754098250.0,UltaEmployees,9,0.95,False

Okay, firstly... I'll absolutely admit that this may sound a bit odd at first, but hey, hear me out! 

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Waking up at 3pm, eating junk food in bed, doom scrolling until 5am. My room looked like a tornado hit it. I was basically a human sloth surviving on study loans while ignoring my classes completely. This went on for months until I realized I had to change my life or I'd be stuck forever.

TLDR: Start reading non-fiction daily and apply what you learn. Build the habit on willpower, not motivation. Use modern tools to make reading addictive. Your brain will literally rewire itself.

# HABIT BUILDING

The game changer for me was reading ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Clear breaks down the science of why we fail and gives you a bulletproof system that actually works.

The biggest mistake I made at first was relying on motivation. I'd get hyped up, promise myself I'd read for 2 hours daily, then crash and burn after 3 days. Motivation is like weather, it comes and goes. You can't build your life on something that unstable.

The solution is willpower plus stupidly small requirements. Instead of ""I'll read 50 pages because I'm motivated,"" say ""I'll force myself to read 1 page because I have enough willpower for that."" Make it so small you can't fail.

Here's the psychology behind why this works. Once you sit down with the book and read that one page, you'll usually keep going. Your brain doesn't want to stop once it's started. But if you set a huge goal and feel overwhelmed, you won't even start.

Try it right now. Go grab any book and read one page. I guarantee you have the willpower for that.

# READING

This is where the magic happened for me. Reading non-fiction daily was the one habit that changed everything else. I got an e-reader and started carrying it everywhere. Public transport, waiting in lines, before bed, it became my default activity.

The benefits hit different when you experience them yourself. You're learning directly from the smartest people who ever lived. Einstein, Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, they're all waiting on your bookshelf. There are books on literally anything you find interesting.

But here's what most people don't realize about reading. It rewires your brain. When you read, you create new neural pathways. You're upgrading your mental operating system every single day. After six months of consistent reading, I feel like I have access to hundreds of brilliant minds.

Books that completely changed my perspective: ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist who breaks down the science of self-control), ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the psychology of optimal experience), and ""Meet Your Happy Chemicals"" by Loretta Breuning (how your brain chemicals actually work).

I've tried everything to make reading more accessible and addictive. Physical books are great but since I got my new job in banking I seldom have time to read full books. My friend put me onto a smart reading app called BeFreed that turns books into engaging and personalized podcasts. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host‚Äôs voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha). It also builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I‚Äôd be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I‚Äôve replaced TikTok with knowledge. Essential sources for any lifelong learner.¬†

I also use Fable to track my reading, discover new books, and stay motivated through the community. For me, the goal is to remove every barrier to consuming knowledge.

The compound effect is insane. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Concepts from one book connect to ideas in another. You start seeing patterns everywhere. Your conversations get deeper. Your problem-solving improves. Friends notice you're giving better advice.

# DOPAMINE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY

This part blew my mind when I learned about it. Most people think dopamine equals pleasure, but that's wrong. Dopamine is actually about wanting and motivation. It's what drives you to seek rewards.

Here's the problem. Social media, Netflix, junk food, they all give massive dopamine hits. Way more than anything in nature ever would. Your brain gets addicted to these super-stimuli. When you're constantly getting these artificial highs, normal activities feel boring.

Reading trains your brain to focus on one thing for extended periods. It's like meditation but you're also gaining knowledge. You're teaching your dopamine system to find satisfaction in learning and growth instead of mindless consumption.

After a few weeks of consistent reading, I noticed my attention span improving. I could focus longer on tasks. The constant need to check my phone decreased. Reading became my replacement for doom scrolling.

# FLOW STATES

One book that changed how I think about activities is ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is when you're completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time. You forget about yourself. You're just present with the task.

Reading creates natural flow states. When you're deep in a good book, hours feel like minutes. This is your brain operating at peak performance. You're not distracted or scattered. You're fully engaged.

The difference between pleasure and enjoyment hit me hard. Pleasure activities give you dopamine but don't make you grow. Scrolling TikTok is pleasurable but empty. Reading is enjoyable because it challenges you and makes you better.

I started filling my days with more flow activities. Reading, learning guitar, having deep conversations. These activities are harder than passive entertainment but infinitely more rewarding.

# PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Start tonight with one page. Any book that interests you. Self-help, fiction, biography, doesn't matter. The goal is building the habit first.

Keep a book or e-reader visible somewhere you'll see it daily. I put mine next to my coffee maker so I'd see it every morning.

Replace one mindless activity with reading. Instead of scrolling while you eat breakfast, read. Instead of watching random YouTube videos before bed, read.

Track your progress somehow. I use a simple habit tracker app. Seeing the streak build up becomes addictive.

Join online communities about reading. Reddit has amazing book communities. Goodreads helps you discover new books and track what you've read.

The crazy part is that six months ago, I thought people who read regularly were just naturally disciplined. Now I realize discipline is just a habit you build one page at a time. Reading taught me that I'm not broken or lazy. I just needed better systems and knowledge about how my brain actually works.

Anyone can do this. You don't need special talent or motivation. You just need to start ridiculously small and be consistent. Your future self will thank you for starting today.",4,1754097875.0,motivation,1,1.0,False
1mfdylz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfdylz,Even if you eat ‚Äúpoorly‚Äù in one day you can still be in a deficit!,"Had no time this morning- stopped at Dunkin for my coffee of course, got the $5 meal deal and thought omg that‚Äôs a crazy amount of calories for such a small meal. I like my coffee light and sweet so I put the same amount of caramel and cream in a medium that comes in a large. I wasn‚Äôt hungry AT ALL for lunch. I work in a chaotic field so I had a Celsius and chilled on my ‚Äúlunch‚Äù break. Came home and made a giant bowl of strawberries, practically the whole container for under 100cals and I felt so full!! Got hungry again and was craving my sourdough bagels- no restrictions here. Protein today was low so I ate a bag of quest chips and had a fiber one with it. Still in a huge deficit for my weight (284) and I feel full and happy. No- my macros aren‚Äôt the best but my goal is to just lose weight so my whole body doesn‚Äôt hurt when I get into the gym. A protein goal will come later in my journey :) amen yall. We got this.

1mfdx9q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfdx9q,I made a smarter water tracker for iOS and I'm giving away lifetime access for the next 24 hours! (Normally $39.99),"Hey all,

I just released an app I've been working on for a while - **Water Tracker: AquaBee.**   
  
I‚Äôm sharing the free Lifetime Pro version of the app here because I thought it might be helpful or just fun for the community  
  
I built this app mainly because most water trackers out there felt either too basic or just didn't calculate hydration accurately. Some even show things like negative hydration, which isn't how our bodies work.   
  
**Why a negative multiplier might make sense (But Doesn't)**  
  
Alcohol increases urine output, but it **doesn't dehydrate you more than the volume you drink**. Instead, it reduces how much of that liquid is retained. For example:

* **You drink 500 ml of beer**, but you might only retain **350 ml or less** because of the alcohol‚Äôs effect on your kidneys.

With AquaBee, I wanted to create something simple but smarter, using science backed hydration values (mainly based on Maughan 2016) so you can log any drink, water, tea, milk, juice, even coffee, and actually know how much it's helping you hydrate.

If you are interested to learn more about the Maughan et al. Beverage Hydration Index (BHI) study you can read more about it from [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465972/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465972/)

**Key features that I was wanted were**  
  
Thoughtful hydration tracking   
Clean markers to track your progress   
Accurate water content for many beverages   
  
And right now, there's a $0 lifetime access for early iOS users for a limited time:¬†

If it helps you stay more mindful about hydration, I'd be really grateful for your support, whether that's sharing it, leaving a kind review, or just sending feedback. It all helps me keep improving the app and make it more useful.

How to redeem the lifetime free offer?  
  
Download the app from the App Store [https://apps.apple.com/app/id6748324681](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6748324681), then tap the Lifetime $0 plan on the paywall screen. That‚Äôs it!

  
Thanks for reading and for being part of this! Enjoy!
