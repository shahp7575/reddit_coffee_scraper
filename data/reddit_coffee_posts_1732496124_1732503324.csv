1gz8ut9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProCreate/comments/1gz8ut9/working_on_custom_brushes/,Working on custom brushes ,"I’m working on a brush I want to do specific stuff, but I can’t seem to figure out a lot of the setting sliders, or how to invert some of them.

im attempting to mimic the look of using, coffee and rough bit of wood.

im trying to get the brush to pool when you stop moving  
and get darker as it pools or you move slower.  
sort of like a burn tool but also a water colour brush.   
one example is doing zig zags and having target rounder corners similar to how the gel pen brush behaves on the ends of the stroke.

I’ve been playing with it for days, the image bellow is as close as I’ve gotten with some unexpected properties, the neon colours happen if you move fast and light, the thickness increases with pressure but so does the darkness. Bellow is two colours a blue and orange I want the slower lighter lines to be less opaque and more water colour, with faster scratching to loose ink, but become thinner.   
Slower=thicker  
faster=thinner

thats been an annoying on to figure out, as I can do the opposite but I don’t understand why I can’t invert it. That and the pooling When stopped And touching. I’ve been modifying a duplicate of an ink brush so far, a modification of “syrup“ , any where I can either the described brush so I can compare what I’m doing wrong? Or can someone tell me what brush setting I can modify for the properties I’m after? This is kinda my first brush in procreate because I’m trying to learn what does what.

I am tired. I love you so much. But today, I am tired of fighting my family. It was your mistake, your lie, it's yours to fix. I am not capable of fighting this alone. I need you here with me.

When we met 3 years ago on a 27th, you said: I am gonna see you again.

I laughed and said good night.

A year later, on a 27th again, you were flying to my country to visit me. We both fell in love. Like a movie story saying goodbye and crying. I was thinking about you all the time. Every time my phone would light up I'd be excited by the thought of you messaging me.

There we go, it's a 27th, and we're seeing each other again.

Between flights overseas, long facetime calls, summers spent together and all of the roadtrips, I realized I was the luckiest girl ever, I found you, by accident on a 27th. I found a best friend, a travel partner, a lover, a let's run and have coffee kind of person, a seize the day kind of guy, a never look back just do your best person. I found you. You were my person. You still are. This is why it's sad. You are my soulmate and we went wrong.

How did we go wrong,? I was your number one fan. I believed so hard in you. I still do. but when you lied about your life I broke into a thousand pieces.

I am sorry. Sorry for me, for you and him. I am sorry he doesn't get to have a father. I understand he was a mistake. You should've told me. You should've tried to open up to me. To talk to me about it. I would've understand it. I actually understand it, I believe everything you say. I understand why you didn't tell me, why you weren't ready. I understand how the past was traumatic to you and how I was a breath of fresh air as you say. I hear you and I see all the efforts you are doing every day. I believe when you say you regret not telling me.

I am still sad. Sad because I love you. I love you because it's stronger than me. It's pulling me towards you everyday.

I may be delusional, crazy and blindly in love with you, I might not be seeing clearly right now, but family is right. Why should I be the one moving abroad when it was your lie. It's your turn to come here and fix it, to show them, to tell them how much you love me and you don't want to lose me. Do it for me.

Come live here with me. Please do. We will show them together how we're each other person and that no matter what happens we don't give up on us. We can finally be together and stop day dreaming of this life. We can have it.

I don't want to give up on us. I think it's only fair if you do the move now. I want my family to know that I am safe with you. Then wherever you want to go, I'll follow you. We'll see the world together like we always said. We'll do all of the roadtrips we planned. and go to Asia for the first time together. Get that Dalmatian dog, and see all the coastline of your country.

It's soon the 27th again, I'm going to you one more time. I'll make sure I'll lean in for a forehead kiss. I'll lay on you and listen to your heartbeats for a little longer. I'll cherish the morning kiss and the coffee you always make me. I'll hug you a little harder and longer. I'll smell you t-shirt a bit more. I won't complain when you'll play in my hair and mess it. I'll take it all in, one more time. I am scared it will be the last time.

If you truly love me, like you always tell me ""you're my greatest love, or my biggest heartbreak"" then you will move here for a bit. Because if you wanted to be with me, you would.

Then, I'll be yours.

ily forever xx

1gz8rkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1gz8rkc/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project.  The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable.  Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels.  Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none

Why is all of this relevant?  I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"".  Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market.  Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase.  Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like.  Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

1gz8qfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/somalifood/?rdt=35701,"Somali traditional coffee ""Bun"" ","The Somali tradition of ""Bun"" coffee is a unique and flavorful preparation of coffee that is widely enjoyed across the country. Bun refers to the traditional Somali coffee, which is typically made from freshly ground Arabica beans, sometimes sourced from local farms. The coffee is often roasted with butter (ghee or clarified butter) and sometimes infused with spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, or cloves.

Key Aspects of Somali Bun Coffee:

1. Roasting in Butter: The coffee beans are roasted in clarified butter (ghee), which adds a rich, creamy flavor to the coffee and enhances its smooth texture. The use of butter in the roasting process is a distinctive feature of Somali coffee and gives it a unique taste compared to other coffee traditions.


2. Spices: Many variations of Bun include spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, which are added to the roasted beans to impart a warm, aromatic fragrance and complex flavor profile.


3. Serving: In Somalia, coffee is traditionally served in small cups, often accompanied by dates or sweets. It is a significant part of Somali social life, especially during gatherings and special occasions. The coffee is typically brewed strong and is enjoyed for its deep, rich flavor.



Cultural Significance:

Bun is more than just a beverage in Somalia—it is a symbol of hospitality and a central part of social gatherings. It is often served when guests visit, and preparing coffee in this traditional way is considered a sign of respect and a way to honor the guest. It also plays an important role in the cultural identity of the Somali people.

Similarities to Other Traditions:

The practice of roasting coffee with butter is similar to other regional traditions, such as in Ethiopia, where coffee is often roasted in a similar manner and served with butter. However, Somali Bun is distinct in its use of ghee and the specific mix of spices that reflect local flavors.

For those interested in recreating this rich and flavorful coffee at home, the key is to use high-quality Arabica beans, clarified butter, and a mix of spices (if desired). It's a beverage deeply tied to the Somali way of life, offering a window into Somali culture and hospitality.

Very bland and flat compared to the other beans.,"Hey caffeinated folks, I just ordered from Dak for the first time and made a big order of 8 different beans to get free international shipping. About half are weird processing, half ""normal"" beans.

After 2 weeks rest I've started to crack them open. The ones I've tried so far have mostly had really loud and clear flavor notes and aromas - Coco Bongo in particular is giving me exactly what's written on the bag and it's pretty crazy.

When I tried to brew Milky Cake though, it gave me... nothing. No distinctive aroma before or after grind, or during brewing. After brewing, the cup was bland and flat with mild acidity, and a very generic, slightly vegetal light roast coffee flavor. Nothing spicy, cakey, or unique whatsoever.

Brew is a typical 4:6 V60 recipe, ground on a ZP6 at around 5.0, 93C 1:16 ratio, TWW.  

I've read that you need to rest it longer (3 weeks at least), but it's crazy to me that these flavors would develop in one more week where there are literally none present at 2.

Not gonna lie, it was devastating for me. What killed me was when I went into the apartment we used to share (with his permission) to get some of my things and saw a note on the coffee table that made it obvious that he was already seeing someone else. I actually had a bad emotional breakdown in front of him because it was so painful to be so quickly replaced and I felt like I had never meant anything to him. 

About three days later he did ask me to come over and we talked about what would be important for us to improve the relationship and actually got back together. I asked him if he had slept with this woman as this was sort of important to me, which he denied. According to him it was just a date. This was about three weeks ago.

So I was staying with him in ""our"" shared apartment since then where most of my things still were (I had only gotten essentials out before as I have no car) and I went to look for something in a kitchen drawer. In there, I found the pack of condoms that we had bought together when I decided to get off birth control about a year prior, but never ended up using as he didn't like condoms. Well .. the pack was open and only 4 out of 10 condoms were left. I asked him about it, and he said he used them for himself. He didn't explain this further and having just gotten back together, I decided not to pry. 

The thought wouldn't leave me though and I started wondering if he still texts her or sees her. My gut feeling was heavily triggered. I felt uncomfortable in the apartment knowing she had been there and not really knowing if they had had sex in our bed, on our couch etc. So on Friday night, I decided I have to bring this up if I want to move forward in a healthy way and was seeking reassurance. I was waiting in our/his apartment for him to come home after work. I texted him that this woman was still heavy on my mind and what had been going on with them, and that I was worried he might still be in touch with her or see her and that i don't see a way how he used to condoms himself, but he denied the first two questions, didn't say anything about the third, and got annoyed with me for asking this yet again. At the same time I noticed he took an unusually long time to come home. It takes 10, 15 minutes with lots of traffic to drive from work to home, but it took him 50. When he came back, I actually apologized to him for making him upset and he was distant the rest of the evening. 

Saturday was normal. Oh Sunday morning, today, my gut feeling was spinning out of control and I did something I usually never do, but he obviously wouldn't give me the truth. For the first time in my life I decided to check his phone while he was in the shower. 

And there it was. not only was he still in touch with her, those 40 minutes detour? He went to see her. According to the messages, he wanted to bring her back her ""toys"" she had left at his place. She asked ""in the parking lot same time as always?"" It was pretty clear that he massively underrepresented whatever they had by saying he ""had a date"". The messages were extremely sexual. On the day we had gotten back together, he texted her that he wanted to take a step back from their relationship and find himself. He didn't mention me. But he kept texting with her regardless, including her sending photos of body parts, and some BDSM style photos which he liked with a red heart emoji. I wanted to throw up.

I knocked on the bathroom door and when he opened I threw his phone in his face and called him a liar and a cheater. He seemed unphased, continued doing his hair. I left, and he texted me that we should have never gotten back together and was only because I had begged him to. It was a mistake because it will always end up like this. He says when we got back together he deleted the apps and her chat (which... No? You didn't?) and then I go and pull ""this shit"". He said he never cheated.  He said I can't be mad and judge him for what he did when we were separated, completely ignoring the fact that he actually saw her in person at the very moment I texted him that I was worried if he was still in touch with her. He didn't even say sorry. He just didn't care. 

Now it's 3 am where I live and I haven't eaten all day but had 3 drinks and can't sleep. I guess he texted her right back that he had found himself and was ready to boink his brains out with her. I didn't want to cry and I was doing alright until now. I wish I could just sleep and never wake up. How can you be so wrong about the man you thought was the love of your life? It hurts so much and I don't know how to make it stop.

I’d like to ask you about pain I developed after getting a cavity filled 5 days ago. Prior to the filling I wasn’t feeling any pain. My doctor said the cavity was pretty deep and we needed to monitor how it evolved.

Right after the procedure and after the anesthesia faded y started feeling intense pain, around a 6 out of 10 that decreased the next day. Day two and day three were very similar, in the intensity of pain, being a 2 out of 10. But today the pain intensified and has been consistently a 4 out of 10.

The pain doesn’t feel localized in the molar that was filled, but in the general area and weirdly enough it feels mirrored in the directly inferior molar. 

Temperature sensitivity has been high, sensitivity to touch has been moderate. I’ve avoided all crunchy foods, and chewing on the side that the filling was done, but I’ve been brushing and flossing as usual without any discomfort. 

Thanks for reading! Have a good one. 

Edit: No smoking, no drinking, yes coffee, yes diet soda, used to eat a lot of sugar, way less since 6 months ago.

Like, did you write your SOP, sit back with a cup of coffee, and just decide, “Yep, this is STRONG AF”? Or maybe you sent it to a friend who hyped you up with, “Bro, this slaps!” and now it’s officially *strong*?

And then there’s the whole LOR thing. When people say, “I have strong LORs,” are we talking about:

1. The person writing it is a big shot (like, Professor McFancyPants from Ivy League U)?
2. Their writing is *chef’s kiss* and reads like Shakespeare took a career detour into academia?
3. Or do you just assume it’s strong because they didn’t write, “This student is... meh”?

Honestly, I’m not sure if “strong” in this context is a vibe, a measurable metric, or just something people say to feel better about their applications.

So, what do you guys think? Am I overthinking this or is the term “strong” just some vague academic flex? Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to roast me for asking what’s probably an obvious question. 😅",18,1732501878.0,gradadmissions,5,0.95,False

At least until you walked in on him changing his shirt after spilling coffee all over it. Panicked, Nia knew he needed to throw you off his trail, to keep his secret safe, but would he be able to? Would you buy it? He could only hope.

Like, did you write your SOP, sit back with a cup of coffee, and just decide, “Yep, this is STRONG AF”? Or maybe you sent it to a friend who hyped you up with, “Bro, this slaps!” and now it’s officially *strong*?

And then there’s the whole LOR thing. When people say, “I have strong LORs,” are we talking about:

1. The person writing it is a big shot (like, Professor McFancyPants from Ivy League U)?
2. Their writing is *chef’s kiss* and reads like Shakespeare took a career detour into academia?
3. Or do you just assume it’s strong because they didn’t write, “This student is... meh”?

Honestly, I’m not sure if “strong” in this context is a vibe, a measurable metric, or just something people say to feel better about their applications.

So, what do you guys think? Am I overthinking this or is the term “strong” just some vague academic flex? Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to roast me for asking what’s probably an obvious question. 😅",7,1732501585.0,MSCS,1,1.0,False

Wanted to ask if you know of any local roaster that sell smaller bags (preferably in the 50-100g range). I've tried a few e.g. Primal Brew (love the Kenya Kiambu), Coffellera, and Sibs.

Been looking to try to explore more international and local single-origin coffee but I find it hard to commit to buying 250g bags since I like cycling through multiple bags within a week (also, I've had some pretty unsatisfying experiences with some local roasters) so I'm just looking for recommendations.

We texted for a few days before he asked me out on a coffee date. We met up yesterday at a coffee place we picked. I was a bit late so I apologized profusely and we ended up having a good date. Since we were having fun I suggested we move to the bar next door for a drink and he accepted. We had a great conversation, had a drink each and he ordered some charcuterie. Since our date was at 4, I figured I would make plans with my bestie since her husband was out of town and let him know beforehand. I left our date at around 7 and we agreed to keep texting and make plans to see each other again. During our date I mentioned that we were going out to a restaurant with my gf and maybe a bar afterwards. Later that evening while I was out I noticed he texted me on Hinge to tell me he had a great time and giving me his phone number and asking me to text me (we hadn't exchanged phone numbers beforehand). I was about to text him back to say I had a great time as well and couldn't wait to see him again, but I kept getting interrupted by my friend and ended up forgetting about it (I have mild ADHD and I can get overwhelmed and forgetful). The next day (so today) I wake up with a hangover (we had lots of fun last night and ended up going dancing) so I woke up at noon. My first thought when I woke up was to text him so I go on the app and I was shocked to see he had unmatched me and I didn't save his number. I can't believe he would think I ghosted him after I clearly showed him (and told him) I had a great time.

This post involves a lot of my INTP introvert-ness and overthinking, and there’s a tldr at the bottom so you can skip the long paragraphs 
>——

I am a barista at a small local coffee shop where there’s really few employees, almost all shifts are solo shifts, and we all have very different life and schedule, so I want to make barista friends outside my cafe.

So I’ve been going to this other cafe as a customer, people there are super nice and friendly, the cafe itself feels great too, and I also told them I too am a barista and we sometimes chat about shared experiences at work or about coffee when I am there.

But than as a barista myself, who is always extra friendly to every customer that comes in no matter if I like them or not, I am afraid to ask to exchange contact in fear that I am going to make them very annoyed.

Because I know I would be, if a customer that I don’t particularly enjoy talking to decides they thinks I am their friend and ask for my contact or even wants to hangout, I would have a hell of a hard time in rejecting them and would probably end up forcing myself to agree to it while not knowing how to interact with them outside of a barista-customer relationship.

But then again, my only one customers who had actually decided to ask for my contact is a awesome person and we are now great friends, so the above are all just imagination and I in fact have great experience making friends with my customer.



So now I’ve demonstrated how I am not able to convince myself if it’s a good or bad idea, I guess the simple question I am trying to ask is just:

>—TLDR—

Do you think that a customer should ever try to make friends with their barista based on their interactions in a customer-to-barista relationship?

If so, what’s the best way to not put the barista in an awkward spot while doing it?",2,1732500461.0,barista,2,1.0,False

So I have been experimenting in what I am calling NOvember:
23 days
100,000 heartbeats saved
10,000 calories not consumed 
$150 saved
More average sleep 
HR dip avg 25% vs 15%
HRV highest month
Nicer person
Feel better
Rode bike  average 4 hrs/wk

NOvember 
NO alcohol 
NO fast food
NO skipping exercise 
NO procrastinating 
NO complaining

I stopped taking my blood pressure medicine too and am averaging about 130/90.  That is about as good as I do on a pill.  

For December I’ve decided to cut back on coffee.  I currently drink 4-6 cups, black, all before noon (no afternoons was a change I made three years ago).  

My sleeping heart rate is about 57, down from 67.  I’m a long distance (century) bicyclist and feel I should be in the 40s for sleeping and around 58 for resting.  I’m 57, 6-2, 180 lbs, fit but not super muscular.

Questions…. Coffee like alcohol is the habit and routine.  Is decaf a good substitute?

How bad is cold turkey?  Alcohol was hard but almost a month in and I feel so good so I don’t mind the discomfort if it is reminding me I am improving.

Finally…. Is it worth it?  Can I drop my BP and HR?",3,1732499891.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

1gz7tuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1gz7tuj/abdominal_pain_due_to_stress/,Abdominal pain due to stress,"Ive been at this company for half a year. At first everything is going smoothly. Until some nagging from one of the bosses. ( Its a family company ) he nags about things he isnt doing or has advised me to do the opposite and decides to tell me I shouldnt have done the other the next. Here's some of the examples: My job requires me to schedule appointments, do invoices etc. We have a tool we use to document every project we receive and everyone has an access to it. Some project needs to be handled by my bosses-because they either told me they would or they have not trained me to do so because they said it requires VIP treatment, etc. So I usually just enter the projects, tag them and let them do the rest. I was told not to schedule ANY appointments for these projects but there are time where this specific POS (piece of sheet) would ask me WHY TF IS THERE A DELAY WITH HANDLING THE F JOB. :) No cuss, but he would often tell me its a ""kinder garden job"" and that I should PROACTIVELY do it. I tell him HE instructed me not to, or the other boss would instruct me not to. He would also tell me to follow through with the updates, and statuses of the projects. To update everything etc. I would, but sometimes some updates, I wouldnt post because I sent it to him directly, again, as INTRUCTED. Then would later nag me about it. When he deals with them, there isnt either an email or update on the said platform. You'd have no F idea what the hell is happening with it unless you call the client directly. But I cant because ""We'd look UNPROFESSIONAL if we ask them what's going on"" so I'd end up calling and giving excuses that the tool has shut down, we had issues, we had a glitch, and I just want to verify the information. He would also nag me for marking him DAY OFF and later booking a appointment for him, when he's the one who told me to 😭 TBH, these were just simple shxt so I wouldnt go off and tell the other bosses nor him. I usually just ignore it even if he tells me the most ridiculous degrading shxt because I dont want to make it a big deal. But its been getting out of hand lately and all the things he should be doing he'd pass it on to me and later ask me why its taking me a time to complete my tasks. I started getting abdominal pain here and there and I thought it was just a simple acid reflux because I love coffee. I stop drinking coffee because I wouldnt want it to affect my work and started drinking more water. But whenever I speak to this POS, I'd get the pain and no pain killers would work. I figured maybe its because of the stress, and started not caring about his messages in the weekends ( when its my day off ) then just a few days ago, I had family emergency and wasnt able to notify him because I was in panic and forgot my phone. i contacted him immediately and told him id be doing my tasks in the evening when I get back ( even though I wouldnt get paid for it because I left half day ) after a family member came to the hospital and he told me to rest-- i immediately felt the pain because I know he wouldnt just let me rest. THe next day, he told me if I didnt want to do this job just tell him and he'd do it instead instead of me messing up everything for him, he told he told he understands my situation then proceeded with telling me a few shitty insults. Like wtf, I told him someone might be dying and he treats me like I never do my job after that I passed out from the pain. its been a week now and i still have the pain and have passed out from the stress 2x after I speak to him.

After trying countless wellness supplements that promised rapid weight loss and endless energy, it felt like I’d seen it all. But after reading up on *Nagano Tonic* and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, “Why not give it one last shot?” What’s different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I’d start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with *Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out—a huge win for me. I didn’t have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn’t instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn’t think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I’d lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better—possibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn’t reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that *Nagano Tonic* isn’t marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious, *Nagano Tonic* felt gentle but effective.

For me, *Nagano Tonic* has become more than a supplement. It’s a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn’t have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It’s safe to say that it’s been one of the best investments in my health journey.

The science behind *Nagano Tonic* lies in its careful selection of natural ingredients, each chosen for its unique contribution to metabolism, energy, and weight management. This formula draws on traditional ingredients, blending them into a tonic that supports the body’s natural processes to promote a healthier, leaner physique without extreme diets or workouts. Let’s dive deeper into some of these powerful components and how they work together.

One of the standout ingredients is **Camu Camu**, a superfood high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Known for centuries in traditional medicine, camu camu works by boosting metabolism and offering a steady energy lift without caffeine. Its antioxidants also help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often underlying contributors to weight gain and sluggishness. This allows the body to process fats and sugars more efficiently, directly supporting weight loss efforts.

Then there’s **Mangosteen**, a nutrient-packed fruit rich in fiber, which aids in feeling full and supports a balanced digestive system. This natural fiber not only promotes satiety but also enhances digestion, helping the body process and eliminate waste effectively. Mangosteen is also noted for containing xanthones, which have anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, mangosteen may help improve metabolic health, making it easier to shed excess weight and maintain energy.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown. By increasing the thermogenic effect (the rate at which the body burns calories to produce heat), EGCG can amplify calorie-burning even without exercise. Furthermore, it’s known to enhance the body’s resilience to oxidative stress, another factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism.

A unique aspect of *Nagano Tonic* is its use of **adaptogenic herbs** like **Ashwagandha** and **Panax Ginseng**. Adaptogens help the body adapt to stress by stabilizing cortisol levels, which are often elevated in response to stress and can lead to fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Ashwagandha is especially beneficial in managing cortisol, which in turn can reduce stress-induced cravings. Panax Ginseng, on the other hand, enhances vitality and supports mental clarity by helping regulate blood sugar, which may reduce the likelihood of energy crashes and associated cravings.

Lastly, **Momordica Charantia**, commonly known as bitter melon, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. Bitter melon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to use sugars more efficiently for energy instead of storing them as fat. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with blood sugar management or experience sugar cravings.

*Nagano Tonic* isn’t just a weight loss supplement—it’s a multi-dimensional health tonic that supports the body’s metabolic and hormonal systems holistically. By integrating these scientifically backed ingredients, it offers a natural path to sustainable energy, effective metabolism, and balanced weight management.

**1. How do I take Nagano Tonic?**  
It’s simple: mix one scoop with water or your favorite beverage, such as a smoothie, once a day. Most people prefer taking it in the morning to experience a sustained energy boost throughout the day.

**2. Are there any side effects?**  
Nagano Tonic is made from natural, non-GMO, and vegetarian ingredients, and it’s generally well-tolerated. However, if you have specific health conditions, it’s wise to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement. Some users report slight digestive adjustments during the first few days, but these typically subside.

**3. How soon can I expect results?**  
Many users start noticing increased energy and reduced cravings within the first week, with more visible weight loss typically occurring after a few weeks of consistent use. However, results vary depending on individual metabolism and lifestyle.

**4. Is it safe for long-term use?**  
Yes. *Nagano Tonic* is designed for sustainable, long-term use, combining ingredients that support general health, not just short-term weight loss. Its adaptogenic herbs, probiotics, and antioxidants contribute to ongoing well-being, which can be beneficial beyond weight management.

**5. Does it require diet or exercise to be effective?**  
Nagano Tonic can support weight loss without a strict diet or intense exercise; however, combining it with a balanced diet and moderate exercise can enhance and speed up results.

**6. Is there a guarantee?**  
Yes, *Nagano Tonic* comes with a 180-day money-back guarantee. If you’re not satisfied for any reason, you can request a full refund—even if you’ve used the entire bottle.

**7. Can anyone take Nagano Tonic?**  
While *Nagano Tonic* is generally safe for most adults, it’s not recommended for pregnant or nursing women or anyone with serious health conditions unless approved by a doctor.

**8. How is it different from other weight loss supplements?**  
Unlike many weight loss products, *Nagano Tonic* targets root causes of weight gain, such as stress, metabolic health, and cravings. Its unique blend of adaptogens, probiotics, and antioxidants works synergistically, promoting a holistic approach to health.

1gz7p7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1gz7p7d/sandals_barbados_review/,Sandals Barbados Review,"Hi all! I just spend a week at Sandals Barbados and wanted to give a review. First of all, our trip was amid all the panic of cancellations and we experienced no issues at all. We were a group of 3 couples all between 30-45, just for reference! 

Rooms: We got there before 3, so had to wait a bit for the room to be ready but we had full access to the property. Once in the room, I was a little disappointed. We did the Club level oceanfront room on Barbados side, which was nice but definitely dated and it’s not a typical “ocean front” you would think of. We weren’t in the room much, so this wasn’t a huge factor and didn’t ruin my trip but would not splurge for “ocean front” again.

Club level: going off of above, club level was a waste of money for us. We have been to other resorts where you get a lounge with a full service bar, snacks and even private pool. Sandals does say you have a lounge, but there was no bar and minimal access to drinks which you had to get yourself and that felt a little weird going in the back to do that. We got room service once and actually didn’t touch the liquor in the room, so overall I would not opt for club level again. Basic room or butler seems to be the way to go. There were also no snacks in the room, which was sad haha

Property: the resort is big, but nothing not manageable. You can easily get from one side to the other in a few minutes. They did a good job of keeping the grounds clean snd well maintained. 

Restaurants/Bars: we did not have a bad meal at Sandals. Nothing was ground breaking but we have been to many all inclusive, so I think we knew what we were getting. We were with a larger group, so getting reservations was hard to do. Club concierge said they couldn’t help us since we had 6 people, so then had to go to dining concierge (another reason why club didn’t seem to have value) and they couldn’t help us only get us into a few places at the end of the week. 
Notable restaurants were:
Bombay - best service we had at a restaurant by Rasheem!
Butchs steak & seafood - probably our favorite meal, but worst service
English pub - Jack was amazing and brought lots of energy to our time there!
Donut shop - donuts were so good and great coffee

Pool/Beach: beach was amazing!! There is a roped off areas behind rocks that is more calm, but if you go off to the side you are able to get some waves and our group loved body surfing. We went out on the heli cat boat one day. The pools were lovely as well, but we did spend most of our time on the beach. Biggest issue with this property had to be the chair situation. If you do not get out by 730, you will not get a chair at either main pool or the beach. Just caused unnecessary anxiety to each morning. 

Service: this is something I was most nervous about due to reviews and I can honestly say we did not meet one person that was rude. Sure, sometimes the service was slow but you’re on vacation … I’m not quite sure what the huge rush is anyways. Every person you would pass just walking always said hello and if we had questions everyone was willing to help. One lady even walked us to a restaurant we could not find (greenhouse) in the pouring rain. If you are a nice and patient person, you will not have an issue with the  service here. We did see quite a few people tipping, which was interesting.

Overall, we had a great time! Barbados is amazing and we loved sandals. I think our whole group is fully on the bandwagon, especially due to the discount you get for booking onsite for a future stay. So needless to say, we are booked for Grenada next year!!

# How Java Burn Works: A Deep Dive into the Magic

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how Java Burn works. Initially, I was skeptical because it all sounded too good to be true. But after trying it out and digging into the details, I realized there's more to this than just hype. Java Burn doesn't just randomly help you lose weight; it targets multiple aspects of your body's processes to make the whole weight loss journey smoother and more effective. Let's break it down into a few key areas: minimizing excess weight by lowering appetite and suppressing hunger, maximizing metabolism, and increasing the fat-burning ratio.

**Lowering Appetite and Suppressing Hunger**

One of the first things I noticed with Java Burn was a change in my appetite. Normally, I have a pretty healthy appetite, and snacking between meals was a bit of a habit. But with Java Burn, I found myself feeling fuller for longer periods. It was like my cravings were dialed down a notch. So, how does this happen?

Java Burn works by interacting with the signals your body sends to your brain about hunger and satiety (that feeling of being full). Usually, when your stomach is empty, certain hormones trigger hunger signals, which is why you feel the need to eat. Java Burn seems to help regulate these signals so you don’t get those urgent hunger pangs as often. It’s a gentle reminder that you don’t need that mid-afternoon snack.

Now, this doesn’t mean you’ll never feel hungry. But the constant urge to eat or snack, especially on unhealthy foods, seems to lessen. It's almost like having a built-in control switch that helps you make better choices without feeling deprived. This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

**Maximizing Metabolism**

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

This aspect alone can make a huge difference in managing your calorie intake, which is a big part of the weight loss equation.

**Maximizing Metabolism**

Let’s talk about metabolism for a second. We all know someone who seems to eat whatever they want and never gains a pound. Chances are, they have a naturally high metabolism. For the rest of us, boosting metabolism can be key to shedding extra pounds. Java Burn claims to kickstart your metabolism and keep it running high throughout the day.

When I started using Java Burn, I noticed that my energy levels stayed more consistent. Typically, I'd experience a slump in the afternoon, but with Java Burn, I felt more energized. It turns out this isn’t just the caffeine talking. Java Burn contains a mix of ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and L-theanine—all known to support metabolism and energy levels. These ingredients work together to keep your body in a state where it's more efficient at burning calories, even when you're not working out.

Over time, this boost in metabolism can lead to a significant impact on weight loss. Your body starts to burn more calories, not just from your morning coffee but throughout the day. It’s like giving your metabolic engine a tune-up, making it run more efficiently, and helping you lose weight more effectively.

# Increasing the Fat-Burning Ratio

Another intriguing aspect of Java Burn is its focus on fat burning. We all have a mix of fat and muscle in our bodies, and when we lose weight, we want to lose fat, not muscle. Java Burn is designed to help your body prioritize fat as its energy source, particularly the stubborn fat that tends to accumulate around the belly.

The science behind this involves boosting your body's thermogenesis—the process by which your body generates heat and burns calories. Ingredients like green coffee bean extract and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn are known to enhance thermogenesis. This means your body burns more calories from fat stores, rather than just using up the calories from the food you eat.

From my experience, this approach seems to work subtly over time. I didn’t notice an immediate drastic change, but after a few weeks of consistent use, I saw a difference in how my clothes fit and felt. It wasn’t a quick fix, but the gradual shift in how my body was utilizing fat for energy was noticeable.

# Why Java Burn Might Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For

So, why consider Java Burn over the countless other weight loss products out there? For starters, its convenience is hard to beat. You don’t have to overhaul your lifestyle or stick to a strict diet. If you're already a coffee drinker, integrating Java Burn into your daily routine is seamless. Plus, there’s something comforting about not having to change everything at once—just a simple addition to your morning coffee that can set the tone for the rest of your day.

Moreover, Java Burn doesn’t rely solely on caffeine to deliver results. The blend of natural ingredients is crafted to work synergistically, enhancing the overall effect on weight loss without the jittery side effects that some supplements cause. It’s a balanced approach that focuses on sustainable weight loss by addressing appetite, metabolism, and fat burning all at once.

# Final Thoughts on Java Burn

After spending time with Java Burn, I've come to appreciate its subtle yet effective approach to weight loss. It’s not a magic pill, and it won’t replace healthy eating and exercise, but it can be a helpful tool in your weight loss arsenal. The biggest takeaway is that Java Burn offers a practical way to support your weight loss goals without drastic changes to your lifestyle. If you're looking for a supplement that fits into your daily routine and provides steady, long-term results, Java Burn might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.

For once, give yourself the chance to liberate your mind from the people and thoughts that occupy it rent-free.

Haven't you had enough? It's too much already.

It's unfair that they can sleep with no worries and go on in pure bliss while you crave the attention and touch that they'll never give you for free.

Last time I checked, you also deserve the love and attention you genuinely give to those who can't see it. 

Yes. You are not just here to serve and be of use to another person.

You also deserve the heartfelt love letters, the hot cup of coffee you serve lovingly in the morning, the warm hugs and kisses, the kind words that make one's heart full the moment you uttered them, the evening lullabies, every single thing you are capable of doing and chose to do for the wrong people, just for the sake of a relationship that was never sure to last.

YOU. DESERVE. ALL. OF. THOSE.

You want to live, right? So please do.

Remind yourself that you are not worth lesser than those around you.

Soon, it will be your turn to meet the reason why you never settled. And when that day comes, you'll see, it will all be worth it.

Once when I met a date from Tinder we seemed to hit it off. Cool. He asked me out on a second date. When I arrived he was tucking into a hearty breakfast. I hadn’t checked prior to see if this restaurant was a pre-pay for meals place. Anyhow, he finished his meal and we chatted and talked for about an hour. Then he said his goodbyes and left.

At the time I was pretty broke. I had only ordered a drink as had about $25 in my bank account. When I went to pay for it they then added on his breakfast, because yep, he’d scarpered without paying and left me with his bill.

Oh and first date, we paid for our own coffees. So no,  he didn’t pay for anything nor offer on the first date. I think he was just stringing me along to see if he could manipulate me to a second date and a free meal.

for one, he’s constantly texting me. like, if i don’t respond within an hour, he’ll send a “?” or something like “are you okay?” it’s not just once or twice—it’s every time. it feels clingy, but when i mentioned it, he said he’s just “really into me” and didn’t mean to come off that way.

then there was this time he brought up stuff about me that i hadn’t told him yet. like, he knew the name of my favorite coffee shop (even though i never mentioned it), and he casually referenced a photo i’d posted months ago on instagram… but we’re not even following each other there. when i asked how he knew, he laughed it off and said he “did his homework.”

last night was the tipping point. we were out to dinner, and he mentioned he’d driven by my apartment earlier that day. i didn’t tell him where i live—he must’ve figured it out somehow. i asked why, and he said he “wanted to surprise me” but decided not to because he didn’t want to seem weird. except… that’s exactly what it seems like.

1gz7ijs,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1gz7ijs/a_response_to_ryan_walters_from_a_former/,"A response to Ryan Walters, from a former Christian club student leader","For four years in the 2000s, I co-led a Christian club at my Tulsa high school.

Wander down the back hall of my school on a Friday morning back then, you’d hear the off-key sound of a dozen students singing worship songs. If you stuck around, you’d hear a kid preach – maybe a reflection on Scripture, maybe a word of encouragement during finals, maybe a call to carry out the Great Commission. Many times, that kid would be me.

Some students liked the group so much, they attended regularly. Others stopped in only once. Most of the kids at our school had no clue we existed and never formed an opinion of us at all.

And there were a few who were bothered by what we did. They would say we were “too exclusive” (we were). They would say we held “bigoted” views (we did).

Yet, not once in those four years did anyone challenge our right to gather. No student, no matter their distaste for what we believed, tried to stop us. So long as we followed school policy, the school let us use a room and then left us alone.

Evangelical culture at large had prepared us for a very different outcome. As Christians, we were taught to expect persecution – from classmates, from our school, from our government. From “martyrdoms” at Columbine to Bill O’Reilly’s “War on Christmas”, our culture was one of increasing antagonism, if not outright violence, to the faithful.

The Christian singer, Carman (whose recording studio sat not far from my school), summed up this mythos back in 1993. In the music video for “Our Turn Now”, Carman sang from the bustling halls of a large public high school:

“The ball got dropped in '62  
They wouldn't let children pray in school  
Violent crime began to rise  
The grades went down and the kids got high  
Free love, gay rights  
No absolutes, abortion on demand  
Brought VD, AIDS, and no morality  
Today no one knows right from wrong  
There's blood on people's hands.”

Carman is referencing the 1962 Supreme Court decision in Engel v. Vitale. The decision, according to Carmen, “wouldn’t let children pray in school” and declared “no God at all!”, leaving society vulnerable to all kinds of ills.

Carman was either ignorant of the law or simply lying. Engel v. Vitale outlawed state-sponsored prayer. A student’s right to pray in school was untouched. If anything, Engel v. Vitale further protected that right. No longer could a student be subjected to a state-sponsored prayer God as a condition of attending school.

This reality was of no concern for many of the most visible and powerful in Evangelical culture. They told a different story: Christians were under attack. Students were on the front lines. In the music video for “Our Turn Now”, Carman, surrounded by a group of singing high schoolers, issued the call: “World, you had your turn at bat. Now stand back and see. That it's our turn now.”

Yet, after hundreds of meetings over four years, the persecution never came. Quite the opposite, in fact. I enjoyed a place of relative power and influence throughout high school.

I was often blind to the experience of those who believed differently than me and the challenges they faced exercising their Constitutionally protected rights. My blind spots were as big as my ego and I didn’t see the role I played in pushing them to the margins.

High school was a long time ago, but the myth I was taught back then hasn’t gone away.

In fact, it’s policy now in the Oklahoma Department of Education. Ryan Walters is waging a holy war. As his now-famous coffee mug states, “Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum” – “if you want peace, be prepared for war.”

Walters preaches that America took God out of schools and it’s up to him and his ilk to bring God back through Bibles in every classroom, mandated viewing of state-sponsored prayer, and the very normal, not-at-all fascistic creation of the “Department of Religious Freedom and Patriotism.”

There’s just one problem - God never left. Students (Christians especially) enjoy more religious liberty today than ever. American schools have simply made room for kids who don’t believe like Ryan Walters and in the process, further protected the rights of every student.

This is something Christians ought to be thankful for. As the author of the Engel v. Vitale decision reminds us, it was Christians, after all, from whom the Pilgrims fled in their search for religious liberty.  Christians have consistently used State power to deny the religious freedom of other Christians in this county, not to mention those of other faiths. Americans have just as consistently fought back. It’s common sense that everyone benefits when the State’s power to enforce religious conformity is restricted.

Ryan Walters knows this but he just doesn’t care. He isn’t stupid. He’s malicious. His is a charlatan’s religion and a despot’s liberty.

Let the kids pray. Let the kids not pray.

And Mr. Walters –please, for the sake of the children you pretend to defend, exercise your Constitutional right to shut up.",76,1732498821.0,oklahoma,5,0.95,False

It’s interesting how, if you take a classical tale and delve into its depths, peeling back the layers of embellishments and half-truths, you can often uncover the seeds from which the tale sprouted. These seeds, when examined, are often far darker and more complex than the sanitized stories passed down through the generations. The Pied Piper is no exception. What started as a whimsical fable to warn against broken promises hides a story that is far more unsettling. I’ve searched far and wide for the truth of it—not just out of curiosity, but because my own fate is inexplicably tied to it. Before I tell you why, let me tell you of Kjäll—the Piper. The “pied” part came later.

Long ago, there lived a boy named Kjäll in a small coastal village nestled at the edge of dark and ancient woods. He was the kind of boy who could disappear into the forest and return days later with berries, fish, and stories of strange, haunting songs carried on the wind. A dreamer, a wanderer—but one who loved fiercely. At sixteen, his world was shattered when raiders came upon his village like a tempest. Fires roared into the night, screams of the dying cut through the air, and by morning, Kjäll stood alone among the ashes. Everyone he had loved—his parents, his younger sister, the girl he had once sworn to marry—all gone.

Kjäll vowed revenge. Not just against the raiders, but against their leader, a man whose name was feared across the lands: Black-Eyed Falk. Falk wasn’t just a raider; he was a monster in human form, a man who seemed to thrive on cruelty for its own sake. But Kjäll knew he could never face Falk in open combat. So, over weeks and months, he tracked Falk to his distant stronghold. By the time he arrived, his heart was a cold, hard thing. Falk had a family—a wife, two children. Kjäll believed that if he could take them from Falk, he could make him feel the same searing agony that burned in his own soul.

But Falk’s family wasn’t what Kjäll expected. His wife was no willing accomplice to his brutality; she had been taken from her own village years before and bore Falk’s children under duress. The children, far from being the offspring of a tyrant, were gentle, wide-eyed innocents. None of this mattered to Kjäll in the moment. The rage blinded him. He set their home ablaze and ensured that no one escaped.

It wasn’t until days later, when he heard Falk laugh at the news, that Kjäll realized what he had done. Falk had cared nothing for them—his wife was a burden, his children an afterthought. The atrocity Kjäll had committed had brought Falk no pain. Instead, it had shattered Kjäll’s own soul. He had become the very thing he despised.

Wracked with guilt, Kjäll stumbled into the wilderness and fell to his knees beneath the shadow of ancient trees. He offered up his life, begging for punishment. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the air grew cold, and he saw something emerge from the darkness. At first, he thought it was the devil himself, come to claim his soul. But then came a light—a warm, piercing light that made the shadows recoil. A voice, neither man nor beast, spoke to him.

It was no devil. Nor was it truly God, but a messenger—an angel, perhaps, or something older, something beyond human comprehension. It told him his remorse had been seen. His heart still had a sliver of light within it, and that light could yet grow, if he so chose. But redemption would not come easily.

Kjäll was given a choice: he could surrender to the darkness and perish, or he could wander the earth, a vessel of both penance and purpose. He would never be able to directly interfere in the evils of men but would instead be tasked with guiding them, nudging them away from the abyss. To aid him in this, the being gave him a gift: a set of pipes, forged from no material of this world. The pipes carried melodies that could soothe the tormented, strike fear into the wicked, and bend the wills of those caught in the gray space between. And so, the Piper was born.

Centuries passed. Kjäll wandered from village to village, from kingdom to kingdom, his story becoming the stuff of whispered legend. Sometimes, he was welcomed as a savior. Other times, he was feared as a harbinger of doom. But always, his presence marked a crossroads for those he encountered.

This brings us to Hamlin.

The story you know is a child’s bedtime tale, sanitized beyond recognition. The truth is far darker. Hamlin was a town plagued not just by rats but by something deeper—an insidious rot in the souls of its people. The rats were only a symptom of their disease. Driven by fear and desperation, the townsfolk turned to ancient practices, rituals that had not been spoken of for centuries. They built crude altars in the woods and invoked the name of Moloch, the ancient demon of fire, famine, and child sacrifice.

The deal was simple: Moloch would rid the town of its plague, but in return, he demanded their children. The elders of Hamlin, those who should have protected their own, were the first to agree. It was easier to sacrifice the young than to face the harder truths of their failings.

This was when the Piper arrived.

To the people of Hamlin, he seemed like an answer to their prayers—a mysterious figure with an aura of power, appearing just as the sacrifice was to take place. But Kjäll had not come to save them from the rats; he had come to save their souls. He played his pipes, and the rats followed him, entranced by the melody. The town watched in awe as he led the creatures to the river, where they plunged into the depths and drowned.

When he returned, the Piper made his terms clear: the people of Hamlin were to abandon their worship of Moloch and turn their hearts to God. Only then would they be spared. Desperate, the townsfolk agreed. But promises made in fear are rarely kept.

A year later, Kjäll returned to find Hamlin darker than ever. The altars to Moloch were no longer hidden in the woods—they stood openly in the village square. The people had not turned from the demon; they had embraced him, interpreting the Piper’s arrival as a sign of Moloch’s blessing. Kjäll’s blood boiled. He had given them a chance, and they had squandered it. He raised his pipes once more, but this time, the melody was not for the rats.

The children of Hamlin, wide-eyed and innocent, heard the song first. They rose from their beds and wandered into the night, their small feet moving in rhythm with the haunting tune. The villagers tried to follow, but the sound of the pipes sent waves of terror through them, freezing them in place.

Kjäll led the children far beyond the village, into the dark woods where no one dared tread. He would not harm them, but he would take them from Hamlin, sparing them from the town’s impending fate. As for Hamlin itself—Kjäll left it to the demon they had chosen. Moloch came for his due, and in his wrath, the town was consumed. Fire rained from the sky, the earth split open, and the air filled with the screams of the damned. By dawn, there was no trace of Hamlin, only a scorched wasteland.

Kjäll, the Piper, disappeared once more, his burden heavier than ever. The tale of Hamlin spread, twisted by time and fear into the children’s story we know today. But the truth remains, buried beneath centuries of lies. And if you listen closely, in the dead of night, you might still hear the faint strains of his pipes on the wind.

Now that brings us to the modern age. How do I know all this? What sent me on this obsessive, desperate quest to uncover the truth of the Piper? It wasn’t idle curiosity. It wasn’t some fascination with folklore or old tales. No, it was personal. It was about Kiara.

Kiara is my cousin. She’s younger than me by a few years, but we were close growing up, more like siblings than anything else. She was wild but kind, quick to laugh and quicker to anger. When she loved, she loved fiercely. When she hated… well, that’s what brought us here, isn’t it?

It happened two years ago. Kiara had been dating this guy, Shawn. On the surface, he seemed great—charming, funny, the kind of guy who could light up a room. But there were cracks in the facade, things that didn’t add up. He was a liar, plain and simple, and eventually, Kiara found out. Worse, she found out in the most brutal way possible. She walked in on him and another girl—a girl she knew, one she’d trusted.

I can only imagine what she felt in that moment, the rage, the betrayal, the humiliation. But it wasn’t just that. Something deeper broke in her, something primal. She didn’t just want to hurt them; she wanted to destroy them.

That’s when she told me time stopped.

At first, I didn’t believe her. I mean, how could I? But the way she described it, the way she spoke about it—it wasn’t like someone spinning a tall tale. It was the confession of someone haunted.

She said she had been standing in that room, her hands shaking with rage, when everything froze. The air grew still, the world silent. Even the dust motes hanging in the sunlight stopped drifting. And then she noticed him.

A young man, cloaked in black as deep as midnight, standing in the corner of the room. He hadn’t been there before, but now he was impossible to ignore. His hair was unlike anything she’d ever seen—orange, but not garish, not fluorescent. It was the soft, ethereal orange of a sunset, warm and almost comforting. But his eyes… his eyes were what struck her most. They were pure black, yet not empty. Tiny stars glimmered within them, like a window into some infinite cosmic void.

And then there was the sound.

He was holding pipes—small, simple, carved from something that looked almost organic, like bone or ivory. When he brought them to his lips, the melody that spilled forth was unlike anything she’d ever heard. It wasn’t music in the way we think of it—it was emotion given sound, something that bypassed the ears and burrowed straight into the soul.

She said the sound wasn’t judgmental. It wasn’t condemning her for what she was about to do. Instead, it was calm, even gentle. And when he spoke, his voice carried the same tone.

He didn’t tell her to stop. He didn’t order her to see reason. Instead, he simply talked to her, laid out the truth of what she was about to do with a kind of painful frankness. He spoke about what would come after—not just the consequences, but the stain it would leave on her soul. He warned her that her rage, her hatred, would carve something into her that could never be erased.

But Kiara didn’t listen.

When the world resumed, she didn’t hesitate. Shawn and the girl never stood a chance. She was… brutal. Efficient. By the time the police arrived, she was sitting in the corner of the room, her clothes soaked in blood.

She’s in prison now. Life without parole. But that’s not the punishment that haunts her. She told me that in the aftermath of the murders, as the adrenaline faded and reality set in, she heard the sound of the pipes again. This time, it wasn’t calm. It was mournful, a lament that followed her like a shadow.

And since that night, she has not slept once without a nightmare.

I didn’t know what to make of her story at first. I wanted to dismiss it as a delusion, something her mind concocted to cope with what she’d done. But then I started digging. I started noticing the patterns, the stories that popped up in old records and whispered folklore. Stories of a mysterious figure who appeared at moments of great moral reckoning, always with the same black cloak, the same orange hair, the same unearthly eyes. And always with the pipes.

That’s what sent me on this quest—to understand what happened to Kiara. To understand who, or what, this Piper really is. And the more I’ve uncovered, the more I’ve begun to realize that the truth is far older, far more terrifying, than anything I could have imagined.

So I began digging. My search for answers led me to dark corners, to places where most people would never dare to tread. I scoured archives, pored over forgotten police records, and followed trails of whispers that seemed to dissolve into the void. What I found wasn’t just folklore. It was real—frighteningly, undeniably real. And it became clear to me that Kiara wasn’t the only one who had met the Piper.

After months of persistence and jumping through countless hoops, I managed to secure something I never thought possible: an interview with Gregory Mathers, one of the most infamous serial killers of the modern era. Convicted of over a dozen murders, though the real number is likely much higher, Mathers was a monster who didn’t just kill—he destroyed. His victims were mutilated in ways that spoke to a deep, pathological hatred of humanity itself.

Mathers wasn’t the kind of man who granted interviews. He’d turned down journalists, criminologists, even filmmakers desperate to make their careers on his story. Yet, for reasons I still can’t explain, he agreed to speak with me. Maybe it was my persistence. Maybe it was the angle I pitched him. Or maybe it was something else, something I still don’t understand.

When I walked into the interview room, the air was thick with something I can only describe as wrongness. Mathers sat shackled to the table, his once-athletic frame now thin and gaunt from years in solitary confinement. His eyes, though—his eyes burned with a sharp, unsettling intensity. He looked at me as if he could see straight through to the core of my being.

“You’re not a journalist,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “What do you want?”

I sat down across from him, trying to suppress the unease crawling up my spine. “I want to know about him. The Piper.”

Mathers froze. For the first time, the cold confidence in his eyes faltered. He leaned back in his chair, the chains around his wrists clinking softly. “So you know about him,” he said, almost to himself. Then he laughed—a hollow, mirthless sound. “Of course you do. He never leaves us alone, does he?”

“What happened?” I asked. “When did you meet him?”

Mathers stared at me for a long time before finally speaking. “It was just before I got caught,” he said. “My last victim. Or… what was supposed to be my last victim. A boy. Thirteen, maybe fourteen. I had him in my basement, tied up. I was… preparing him.” He paused, as if weighing whether to continue. “Then, time stopped.”

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

Mathers continued, his voice quieter now. “Everything froze. The lights, the air, even the kid. And then I saw him. Just standing there, at the edge of the room, like he’d always been there. Cloak black as midnight, hair like a dying sunset. And those eyes… God, those eyes. They weren’t human. They weren’t anything. Just stars and darkness.”

“And the pipes?” I asked.

Mathers nodded. “He was playing them. Softly. The sound—it wasn’t music, not really. It was… emotion. It made me feel everything I’d tried to bury: guilt, fear, anger. And then he stopped. He just stood there, looking at me, and said, ‘You don’t have to do this.’”

I leaned forward. “What did you say?”

Mathers laughed again, shaking his head. “What do you think I said? I told him to go to hell. Told him it wasn’t his place to judge me.”

“Did he judge you?”

“No,” Mathers said, his voice almost a whisper. “That’s the thing. He didn’t judge me. He didn’t scream at me or threaten me. He just… talked. Told me what I was doing to myself, how every life I took was carving pieces out of my soul. Told me it wasn’t too late to stop, to turn back.”

“Did you listen?”

Mathers looked at me with an expression I’ll never forget. It wasn’t anger or regret. It was something deeper—something raw. “I wanted to,” he admitted. “For a moment, I really wanted to. But the thing about monsters like me? We don’t stop. We can’t. The rage, the hunger—it’s all we are. So I ignored him. I told him to leave me alone.”

“What happened after that?”

Mathers’s gaze dropped to the table. “He looked at me for a long time. Then he said, ‘I can’t make you stop. But you’ll see what happens if you don’t.’ And then he played his pipes again.”

The room fell silent. For a moment, Mathers looked like he wasn’t even there, like he was lost in the memory. Then he spoke, his voice trembling.

“When the world started moving again, I… I couldn’t do it. The kid—I couldn’t even look at him. It was like the music had burned something into my brain. I let him go, but… it didn’t matter. I was arrested the next day.”

“And now?” I asked. “Do you still hear the pipes?”

Mathers’s hands clenched into fists. “Every night,” he said, his voice breaking. “Every goddamn night. I hear them in my dreams, pulling me back to what I’ve done. I see every face, feel every scream. He warned me. He tried to stop me, and I didn’t listen. And now… now I’ll never escape him.”

I left the prison that day with more questions than answers. The Piper had come to Mathers, just as he had come to Kiara. He had tried to reason with them, to guide them away from the edge. And when they didn’t listen, he didn’t punish them. He let them punish themselves.

But the consequences were always the same. The Piper doesn’t just haunt the wicked. He leaves them to be consumed by the weight of their own darkness. And in the end, that might be the most terrifying punishment of all.

My obsession with the Piper consumed me. Days bled into nights as I scoured the internet, chasing faint whispers and fragments of forgotten lore. I read forums, obscure websites, and even conspiracy theory threads—anything that could offer me the slightest lead. It was on one of these late-night rabbit holes that I stumbled upon a blog post buried in the depths of the internet, the kind of page you’d swear would vanish the moment you refreshed.

The post was written by someone named Evan Reed, and it was titled: “The Piper: A Second Chance I Didn’t Deserve.”

Evan’s writing wasn’t polished, but it was heartfelt. He described an experience eerily similar to Kiara’s. There was no time freeze in his story, but there was a man—cloaked, with orange hair and those impossible, star-filled eyes. Evan had met the Piper on a dark night when he was on the verge of doing something unspeakable. The post was vague on the details of his crime, but I could read between the lines. He’d planned to kill someone.

The Piper had stopped him, talked him down. And then, as Evan fled the scene, a bus had struck him. By all accounts, Evan should’ve died that night. Instead, he woke up in the hospital with only a few broken bones and a newfound resolve to change his life. Evan believed the Piper had brought him back, not just to spare him, but to give him a second chance to be better.

What stood out to me the most wasn’t just the story—it was the ending. Evan wrote that, whenever he did something that truly made him proud, he would hear the faint sound of pipes on the wind. And every time he did, good fortune followed.

The post ended with an email address for anyone who wanted to talk. I hesitated. Reaching out felt… dangerous, like I was teetering on the edge of something I couldn’t pull back from. But I couldn’t stop myself. I needed to know if Evan’s story was real.

Evan agreed to meet me.

He wasn’t at all what I expected. He was in his late thirties, clean-shaven with kind eyes and a warm smile. He looked like the sort of man you’d see coaching Little League or working the grill at a neighborhood barbecue. But there was something in his posture, a slight hesitation in the way he moved, that hinted at a darker past.

We met at a quiet coffee shop, and after exchanging pleasantries, I cut straight to the point. “Tell me about the Piper,” I said.

Evan’s expression turned serious. “I thought you’d ask about him.” He leaned back in his chair, staring out the window for a moment before speaking. “It was about ten years ago. I was… not a good person. I was angry all the time, blaming everyone else for my problems. My life felt like a constant spiral, and one night, I snapped.”

He looked down at his coffee, swirling the cup absentmindedly. “There was a man I worked with—Tony. He wasn’t the reason my life was falling apart, but he was a convenient target. I convinced myself it was his fault I’d lost my job, my girlfriend, everything. And I decided he needed to pay for it.”

Evan’s voice grew quieter. “I went to his house that night with a gun.”

The coffee shop seemed to grow colder. I could feel the weight of his words pressing down on me. “What happened?” I asked.

“I was standing outside his house, about to go inside, when I saw him,” Evan said. “The Piper. He didn’t freeze time or anything. He just… appeared. One second I was alone, and the next, he was standing there, watching me.”

Evan’s gaze grew distant, as if he were reliving the memory. “He had that cloak, that hair. Those eyes. But it was the pipes that really stopped me. He played a melody that cut straight through my rage, my grief, my self-pity. And when he stopped playing, he spoke.”

“What did he say?”

Evan smiled faintly. “He didn’t tell me I was evil. He didn’t call me a monster. He just asked, ‘Is this really who you want to be?’”

I leaned forward, hanging on his every word.

“He talked to me for what felt like hours,” Evan continued. “About the man I was and the man I could be. He didn’t sugarcoat anything, didn’t try to make it sound easy. But he made me see what I was about to do, really see it. And he told me something I’ve never forgotten: ‘The road back is harder than the road forward, but it’s worth walking.’”

Evan fell silent for a moment, his fingers tightening around his coffee cup. “I don’t know why I listened to him, but I did. I turned and ran. I was so focused on getting away from Tony’s house that I didn’t see the bus.”

I swallowed hard. “What happened?”

Evan shrugged, almost like he couldn’t believe it himself. “It hit me. Hard. I should’ve been dead on the spot. But the next thing I remember, I was waking up in a hospital bed. The doctors said it was a miracle I survived, let alone with just a broken leg and a few bruises.”

“You think the Piper saved you?” I asked.

“I don’t think,” Evan said firmly. “I know. And I know why he did it. He didn’t just spare me—he gave me a chance to make it right.”

Evan’s smile returned, softer this time. “I’ve spent the last ten years trying to live up to that chance. I started volunteering, helping people who are struggling like I was. I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. And sometimes, when I do something that really makes me proud, I hear the pipes again. Just for a second, on the wind. And every time I do, something good happens. An opportunity, a bit of luck. Like he’s letting me know I’m on the right path.”

His words sent chills down my spine. Evan wasn’t like Kiara or Mathers. He had listened to the Piper. He had changed. And for that, he’d been rewarded.

As we parted ways, I couldn’t stop thinking about what he’d said. The Piper wasn’t just a harbinger of punishment. He was a guide, offering a chance—a hard, narrow chance, but a chance nonetheless. But for those who ignored him, like Kiara and Mathers, the consequences were devastating.

I left that meeting with more determination than ever. The Piper was real. And somehow, he was still out there, watching, playing, shaping the fates of those who crossed his path.

The search continued, pulling me deeper into the lives of people most would prefer to forget existed. I wasn’t chasing legends anymore; I was uncovering patterns—threads that wove together across centuries, tied to acts of unimaginable violence and the faint, fleeting presence of the Piper. It wasn’t easy. These were people locked away for the rest of their lives, often isolated from the world, yet their stories shared echoes of something unexplainable.

One name stood out early in my research: Derrick Hale, an infamous spree killer from the early 2000s. Hale had been dubbed “The Butcher of Bleakwood” by the media, a man who killed with such unrelenting ferocity that even the most hardened detectives described his crime scenes as nightmarish. Over the course of two weeks, he took 15 lives, all seemingly random. His only connecting thread was the chaos he left behind—until his abrupt, almost anticlimactic capture.

Hale’s arrest baffled authorities. After slaughtering his way across state lines, he walked into a small-town police station, blood still on his hands, and confessed to everything. But the official records left out one crucial detail, one that I only found buried in an old transcript from his psychological evaluation.

According to Hale, it wasn’t guilt that drove him to turn himself in—it was a man with a cloak and pipes who came to him on the night of his final murder. I needed to know more.

I visited Hale at the maximum-security facility where he was serving multiple life sentences. Meeting him was a stark contrast to meeting Evan Reed. While Evan exuded warmth and humanity, Hale was something else entirely. Even behind the reinforced glass of the visitation booth, he was unnerving—his sharp features and pale skin giving him a wolfish, predatory air. His eyes held no remorse, only a flicker of curiosity as I sat down.

“You’re not a cop, and you’re not a shrink,” Hale said, his voice low and rasping. “So what do you want?”

“I want to know about the Piper,” I said.

That got his attention. He tilted his head, studying me like a puzzle he couldn’t quite figure out. “Interesting. Nobody’s asked me about him before. Most people don’t want to know what really happened.”

“Tell me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

Hale leaned forward, his expression darkening. “It was after my last kill,” he said. “A woman. Her name was… I don’t even remember. Isn’t that sick? I took her life, and I don’t even remember her name. But I remember him.”

He shifted in his chair, his chains clinking softly. “I was standing over her body, thinking about where I’d go next. Then everything just… stopped. The blood dripping from my knife froze in midair. The sound of the city outside disappeared. And then I saw him.”

Hale’s eyes narrowed, his voice lowering to a whisper. “He wasn’t human. You understand that, right? Whatever he is, it’s not human. That cloak, that hair, those goddamn eyes—like staring into the void of space.”

“And the pipes?” I prompted.

Hale nodded. “Yeah. He played them, just a few notes. It wasn’t like music—it was like a hammer to the chest. All the rage, the power I’d felt, it drained out of me in an instant. I was just… empty.”

“What did he say to you?”

Hale’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. “He said I had a choice. Told me I could keep walking this road and see where it ended, or I could stop. Said I was standing on the edge of something I couldn’t come back from.”

“What did you do?”

“I told him to go to hell,” Hale said, his voice dripping with venom. “I wasn’t about to take advice from some freak playing a flute.” He laughed, a sharp, hollow sound. “But here’s the thing—he didn’t argue. He just looked at me, like he already knew how this was going to end. And then he played again.”

The room seemed to grow colder as Hale spoke. “The music… it showed me things. My future. The bodies I’d pile up. The way it would end for me—alone, hunted, forgotten. It was like he carved it into my brain with sound. By the time he stopped playing, I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.”

“And that’s when you turned yourself in?”

Hale nodded slowly. “Not because I felt guilty. Not because I wanted redemption. Because I couldn’t take it anymore. That music—it’s still with me, you know. Every time I close my eyes, I hear it, reminding me of what I am.”

From Hale, I moved on to others. Each story was different, but the Piper’s presence remained the same. There was Lorena Vega, a nurse who had poisoned seven patients at a hospital before the Piper confronted her in a supply room, playing a melody that brought her to her knees. She stopped killing that day but was haunted by the music until her dying breath.

There was Timothy Griggs, a quiet man in his seventies who confessed to killing his wife decades earlier after hearing the Piper’s song in a moment of drunken rage. Griggs had spent the rest of his life trying to atone, but he claimed that the Piper’s presence followed him, subtly nudging him toward paths of kindness and selflessness.

And then there was Mara Henson, a former cult leader who had planned a mass suicide. She described the Piper as both a savior and a tormentor, his music forcing her to confront every life she would have destroyed. She disbanded the cult the very next day but spent the rest of her life in self-imposed isolation, terrified that she would never escape the Piper’s gaze.

The more stories I uncovered, the more the Piper’s presence grew in my mind. He wasn’t just a figure of myth or folklore—he was something larger, something ancient. He didn’t force people to change; he showed them the truth of who they were and left the choice to them.

But for those who ignored him, the consequences were undeniable. The music didn’t punish them—it revealed the punishment they carried within themselves. The Piper was a mirror, reflecting the darkest parts of the soul and leaving them to face the weight of their own actions.

And I couldn’t help but wonder: was he watching me too?

The Piper had become my life.

At first, I convinced myself this was just research, a way to piece together what happened to Kiara and maybe help her find some kind of peace. But the deeper I dug, the more I realized that this wasn’t just about her. It was about something much larger—something ancient and incomprehensible, moving quietly through the shadows of human history.

I began to piece together the Piper’s past from the fragments left behind: testimonies, obscure accounts, even scraps of forgotten literature. It wasn’t easy. Most of what I found was buried in records that had been mislabeled, misplaced, or intentionally hidden. But slowly, a picture began to emerge.

There was a 15th-century trial transcript from Germany. The accused, a woman named Liesel Brandt, was burned at the stake for witchcraft. Her crime? She had claimed to have met a figure she described as der Sternenblicker, “the Star-Gazer.” The description was unmistakable—black eyes filled with starlight, a sunset hue to his hair. She said he had come to her during a moment of despair, when she was considering poisoning the family that had accused her of sorcery. According to her testimony, the Star-Gazer had played his pipes and shown her the weight of her actions. She had changed her mind but had confessed her thoughts in a moment of guilt, only for the family to turn her over to the authorities.

Then there was the journal of a French priest, Father Marceau, who lived during the 18th century. His writing was filled with doubts about his faith, but one entry stood out. He described a meeting with a cloaked figure who played a haunting melody on pipes. The figure had spoken to him about the nature of forgiveness and justice, urging him to rethink his role as an inquisitor. Father Marceau had resigned from his position soon after and dedicated the rest of his life to caring for the sick and destitute.

Another account came from a dusty book I found in a university library, one that had long since been removed from circulation. It was a collection of old Appalachian folktales, including a story about “the Wanderer of the Hollow Hills.” The Wanderer, according to the story, would appear to those standing at the edge of a terrible decision. His pipes could freeze time, and his voice carried the weight of truth.

As I pieced together these stories, one thing became clear: the Piper wasn’t a legend confined to Hamlin or even Europe. His presence stretched across centuries, cultures, and continents, always appearing at moments of moral reckoning. He was an enigma, a paradox—part redeemer, part tormentor. He didn’t force change. He simply held up a mirror.

But what haunted me most were the patterns I couldn’t ignore. Again and again, his presence seemed tied to moments of darkness. It wasn’t just individuals he visited; it was communities, towns, entire civilizations. And one name kept surfacing, whispered like a curse across the centuries: Moloch.

1gz7c1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gz7c1y/my_stupid_love/,My stupid love ,"So, gonna try to keep this short but:

This summer i met a girl at work. She stepped in as my boss during the summer and since im very experienced and she was new to many of the stuffs on my department, it ended up with me helping her out alot. During 3 weeks we spent alot of time together working, but Also joking, sharing personal stuff etc. We grew kind of fond of each other. Last day of her substituting on my department we thanked each other for the summer, gave each other a hug and i thought we wouldnt interact much more after that. She was living in a relationship and had a child with this other man. 

Fast forward to the next monday. She massages me asking if i Wanna grab breakfast together. For the coming month after this we spend each day seeing eachother when we can, we talk on the phone during work more and more often and for hours at a time. We are growing very fond of eachother and i start developing feelings for this woman. A month later we have ”the talk”. She simply says shes in love with me, but due to her having a man it cant be Any more than this. This ends up with me crying infront of her but accepting it. When i tell her i want distance from this she gets a look of regret, and when giving each other a last hug, she goes in and kisses me. This sparks something new, and even though the coming days was up and downs, this ”relationship” Moves forward. 

The next two months we see each other in our freetime whenever its possible, we have sex, we go to the neighbour cities to go for coffees and shopping, i met her child a couple times etc. We develop extremely deep feelings for each other and tell each other we love one and another. This is the most genuin and beautiful connection I’ve ever felt in my life. It feels so pure.

This womans partner i havnt met myself. She pictures him as a typical asshole though. He has been physical multiple times to her, cheated and havnt cared about taking care of their child. He finds out me and her gf are talking ti each other through snapchat and asks her to show him our conversation. She tells him No and it ends up with him craving the phone and smashes it to pieces. Fast forward a couple days and the seperation is in full process. It ends up with him asking her for forgivness and even though she wants to get out she says she wouldnt manage to give up time with her child so she decides to stay. 

She talks to me alot about this and i tell her i dont agree with her decission but i respect it if i have to. Since then we havnt had Any physical contact och spent time outside of work. We still talk for hours everyday etc but only as friends for now. She says she wants me to move on and at the same time she loves me and wants me in her life, if only as a friend for now. 

I hate this, i love her so much and want Whats best for her. I dont agree with her decission but i understand its with the child in mind. 
She wants me to find closure with other women for now, but the thing is; i cant since im still so madly in love with this woman. She is everything i ever wanted in a partner. And at the same time i feel like im disrespecting myself so much by standing here and wait for her, which might never happen. Im just so lost in all of this. I really was fully decided on this working out but now it just feels like an dead end. 
She wants us to friends and i dont Wanna give up on our contact. And at the same time i feel like i have to, for my own being. Life is hard…",1,1732498269.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

She was both verbally and physically abusive. 
I also just found out from several people that She actively sabotaged my career for the last 2 years . All while she hasn’t held a steady job for the entire 15 years .
Obviously, there’s a lot of detail left out . 
My question, is what do I do now? There’s very little support for male abuse survivors . 
While I am safe I have no resources to restart my life. All I’m left with is a bunch of debt .
And depression . I’m not sure why I stayed so long. 
I guess I thought I was living her unconditionally . That the mental illness was the same as a physical disability. Or some thing like that. 
She’s hit me with metal chairs, not folding chairs. thrown coffee cups at my head, waited until I wasn’t looking g and would run and knock me over into stuff like a book case, or table so o wouldn’t be able to catch myself. And I’m a big guy so besides a couple cuts and bruises (well except I’m about 30% def in my right ear, she would sneak up, grab my head and scream into my ear with her mouth against my ear. 
I’ve never laid a hand on her. Not even to protect myself. I’m much bigger and stronger than her so it would have probably really hurt her .
And that was the least of the abuse, 
It was the verbal explosions for no reason, the insults, the intention public humiliation and withholding affection . Not just sex. I kind of got used to that and o guess it didn’t get the reaction that was expected . 
I just thought she was getting older and while I have a strong sex drive I don’t want to be a jerk because of what I thought was just biology.
But eventually , there was very little affection or none at all. 
And there’s so much more. 
And when I call the abuse hotlines I find zero resources for men.
As a union organizer, I find that unacceptable but as a survivor it just makes it so much more difficult to get free. 
I’m still responsible for the rent and all the bills . 
I’m filing a separation but do y have high hopes. Connecticut family court is just depressing when it comes to men who are just trying to do the right thing.
I get there are a lot of men that are not doing the right things and I’ll be the first one to say something if I see it .

Went on a trip to Vegas for a weekend with a friend, and noticed the weather report on the day of our return flight was a high wind advisory, which in my mind read “turbulent ascent”. While I’m not petrified of flying, a takeoff from Chicago a few years ago that had an extremely turbulent takeoff left me with lingering flight anxiety since. So I spent the next 12 hours a bit nervous. 

Got to the airport, began boarding, and found my aisle seat. A few minutes later someone taps my shoulder and it’s a flight attendant, I take  my headphones off and she points to the middle seat and asks if she can squeeze in. Confused, I get up and she sits down, takes. Book out, and starts settling in. As boarding continues, I see two more FA’s and a pilot walk down the aisle. I ask my neighbor what the deal is and she said “we just got off work and are headed home!”  

Sure enough, pilot announces that takeoff is going to be bumpy, I try to distract myself. As we takeoff, the plane is pushed around pretty significantly, I start to feel a bit of anxiety, as the normal moment of wobble during takeoff doesn’t end, but feels to just sustain with moments of more intense jostling. I look over at my seat neighbor: working on logging onto the in flight WiFi, seemingly completely nonplused. I look down the aisle behind me where another FA seat down earlier: they are reading a book, barely aware of the plane being pushed around. This immediately calms me, if these folk aren’t concerned, then Why should I be?

We reach cruising altitude and at some point the FA I’m sitting next to wakes up in time for the coffee cart, I mention the takeoff was pretty bumpy,and she says “oh that? There wasn’t a moment that I was concerned about that takeoff. Just remember, if it weren’t safe to takeoff, the pilot won’t. In fact, the airport will make that call before they are in a position to make the call themselves.”

Just a little bit of encouragement to anyone who struggles. I know people talking about statistics never really helps quell my anxiety, because anxiety is an irrational defense mechanism! It doesn’t listen to reason and statistics. But this real life interaction really. Helped me and mindset moving forward. ",29,1732497944.0,fearofflying,4,1.0,False

1gz77nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1gz77nc/i_know_what_happened_to_ashmont/,I know what happened to Ashmont ,"For the past week, I’ve been one of many detectives assigned to the case in Ashmont, South Carolina. A small, quiet town with a population of exactly 5,147, or at least that’s what the road sign used to say. Now, it’s a ghost town—every last soul gone without a trace, as if they’d vanished into thin air. The police department was at a loss, and state authorities were scratching their heads. So they brought us in, hoping a few fresh eyes might uncover what they’d missed.
At first, I’d convinced myself this would be another dead-end case, something that would baffle us for a while, and then we’d all be called away to more “pressing” matters. But that was before I found the journal.
It was stashed under the floorboards of the Twist family’s farmhouse, concealed like a hidden treasure. I remember dusting off the cover, noting the rough, calloused handwriting etched deeply into the paper. A journal kept by Jack Twist, the local farmer, his wife Maria, and their children, Ethan and Jessica. Reading it felt strange, invasive even, like I was peeking into his life through a veil that was too thin. But I had to know. I had to understand what happened here, no matter how strange or impossible the story might seem.
“Go ahead, tell me why everyone vanished,” I whispered to the empty farmhouse as I opened the journal, flipping to the first date that caught my eye. The words seemed innocent enough, the daily thoughts of a farmer who’d lived the same routine for decades. But there was a subtle tension—an unease threading through his words, hidden in the margins.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 21
I woke up at six a.m., just like every other day. Had flapjacks for breakfast, coffee on the side. Syrup was thick and sweet, just how I like it. Got me thinking it’d be even better with chocolate chips, though. Maybe I’ll surprise the kids with some tomorrow. That thought was enough to get my mouth watering.
I can picture him—Jack, a man who worked with his hands, his life defined by the rhythm of planting and harvesting, season after season. I imagine him at the breakfast table, savoring a simple pleasure, his mind half on his family, half on the long day ahead.
By six-thirty, I was out in the fields, preparing the soil. Spread some fertilizer and mixed in the compost. Maria joined me after she got the kids off to school. She’s got a good hand for this work, that woman. Always knows just how much to give to the earth to make it yield what we need.
In his words, I could hear his admiration for Maria. Not the sentimental kind, but the practical, respectful admiration of a man who knew his wife’s worth in a quiet, unspoken way. A family bound not just by love, but by work, by shared purpose.
By seven, the kids were off, and Maria was at my side in the field. We finished prepping the soil by seven forty-five and took a well-deserved break, sipping water and looking over our work. There’s something comforting in the pattern of the rows, each line straight and true.
I paused, picturing the neat rows stretching out across the farmland. There was a rhythm to his life, a sense of order. But life in a place like Ashmont was often quiet and simple, right until it wasn’t.
Around nine, we started planting—corn, soybeans, a few other vegetables. Just enough to keep us through the season and maybe sell a bit extra at the market come harvest. By noon, we stopped for lunch. I had a salad, though I’ll be honest, it wasn’t as good as Maria’s cooking. But work doesn’t wait, and soon we were back to it.
He wrote with a blunt simplicity, a straightforwardness that felt like him. No pretension, no drama—just a farmer doing his job. I admired the way he took pride in his work, though he didn’t exactly say so.
We fed the animals after lunch, kept an eye out for any pests and weeds that might creep in. Spent the rest of the afternoon moving from one chore to the next, checking on each crop, every animal, till it was eight in the evening.
Then came the first sign of something out of place. My eyes widened as I read his next words.
When I went outside after dinner, I saw something strange. Lights in the sky. Bright, almost too bright, moving fast—faster than anything I’ve ever seen. Too close to be a shooting star. At first, I thought maybe it was some military aircraft, though I’ve never seen one come this close to the fields.
I could picture him, standing in the cool night air, the warm glow of the farmhouse behind him, staring up into the darkening sky as those strange lights passed overhead. It must have felt like an omen, a signal that something was coming, though he couldn’t know what.
After that, I didn’t think too much about it. Just went to bed like always.
I closed the journal, leaning back in my chair. It was just an ordinary day on the surface, but beneath the routine, there was a tension building—a feeling that things were about to go very wrong. Jack’s words were plain, unembellished, but they carried weight, a creeping unease that was beginning to settle over me.
Back in the farmhouse, I took a deep breath, glancing around the empty rooms. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was silly, of course, but the sense of abandonment here was overpowering. This had been a family’s home, filled with life, warmth, laughter. Now it was nothing but hollow silence.
“What did you see, Jack?” I murmured, running my hand over the rough wood of the table, imagining Jack and Maria sitting here with their children, talking over breakfast, planning their day.
The empty town, the silence, the mystery—it was unsettling in a way I couldn’t put into words.
The journal continued, its pages now feeling heavier in my hands, as if they held secrets that were waiting to burst out. Jack Twist’s words from April 22 left me with a chill that I couldn’t quite shake. His life had followed a strict rhythm, like clockwork. But these entries were different—raw, scattered, his words grasping for something beyond his understanding. I flipped to April 22 and began to read.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 22
Tonight something very weird happened. I saw something tall, human-like, skinny, just standing there in the dark outside. It made strange noises, like nothing I’d ever heard, something almost animal, yet more… calculated. I only got a glimpse, though. When I stepped out for a closer look, it was gone. Very, very strange.
The image of Jack standing on his porch, the night wrapped around him like a heavy blanket, took shape in my mind. I could almost feel his unease—the way his pulse must have quickened as he strained to make out that figure in the dark, watching his every move. It was more than just an intruder; he described it with the kind of dread that seemed to go beyond logic.
Why would someone—something—come all the way out here, in the dead of night, just to disappear the second he came near? The thought gnawed at me. This was more than a routine break-in. Whatever it was, Jack had sensed that this visitor wasn’t of the usual sort.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 23
Today was strange, too. Got up at six a.m., had eggs and bacon with some coffee. The usual. By seven-thirty, I decided to head into town. I needed a few supplies, and, well… I figured I ought to tell someone about what I saw last night.
Jack didn’t say much here, but I could feel his reluctance. In small towns like this, everyone knew each other’s business. To step out of line, to admit you’d seen something “strange,” was almost like asking for trouble. I could imagine him rehearsing his words on the drive, carefully choosing each phrase to sound reasonable.
When I got to the police station, I told the officer, “Someone was on my property last night. Tall, skinny, and that’s all I could make out in the dark.”
It must have taken him a while to get those words out, each syllable feeling heavier than the last, his mind racing with the memory of that figure in the shadows. I could picture the officer looking up, surprised but trying to keep his expression neutral.
The officer nodded, and his response caught me off guard. “It’s strange,” he said, “we’ve been getting a lot of reports about people like that—tall, skinny, trespassing on properties around town. But we can’t figure out who they are.”
The conversation must have left a pit in Jack’s stomach. He hadn’t been the only one to see this figure—or figures. Whatever was happening wasn’t isolated to his farm. There was an undercurrent, a creeping pattern that was starting to emerge, and yet nobody seemed able to make sense of it.
After that, I left the station and headed to the store for supplies. Just before I walked in, I noticed the community board by the door, covered in missing persons posters. It was strange—too many faces looking back at me, too many families with no answers. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was all connected.
Jack’s words were casual on the surface, but they hinted at something darker. Missing people in Ashmont wasn’t unheard of—sometimes people got into bad situations, fell on hard times, or even chose to leave. But this many, all at once? And now the reports of figures moving around the town at night, silent shadows with no clear intention?
I closed the journal and sat back in my chair, tapping my fingers against the table. This case had gone from strange to unsettling in a way I hadn’t quite anticipated. There was a pattern here, a thread that tied everything together, though it was frayed and barely visible. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Jack had seen something that no one was supposed to see. And whatever it was, it wasn’t done with him yet.
Standing alone in the Twists’ farmhouse, I looked around, half expecting one of those tall, dark figures to be lurking in the shadows. The silence was so thick it felt oppressive, as if the whole house were holding its breath, waiting. Outside, the fields stretched out under a gray sky, the crops waving gently in the breeze, indifferent to the troubles brewing around them.
“What were you thinking, Jack?” I murmured, almost hoping for an answer.
The journal was my only connection to his world now, each page a glimpse into his mind as the events of Ashmont began to spiral out of control. And I had the sinking feeling that, in the coming days, Jack’s accounts would only get stranger.

Chapter Three
Jack’s journal for April 24 had a new sense of urgency, a kind of dread that only seemed to grow with each sentence. I could feel his frustration, his helplessness as he tried to make sense of a town that was slowly slipping out of his control. I began to read, feeling the weight of each word as he grappled with the realization that something was very wrong.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 24
I thought yesterday was strange, but today… today was different.
I woke up at six a.m., like usual. First thing I noticed was the darkness—thicker than normal, like it was pressing down on the house. I went to flip on the lights, but nothing happened. Tried again, thinking maybe I’d just missed the switch in the dark. But no, it wasn’t me—the power was out.
Jack must have felt a prickle of unease then, even if he didn’t say it. A simple power outage would have been one thing, but out here, without lights, the familiar farmhouse must have felt different, almost hostile.
So, I figured, alright, I’ll go turn on the generator. That should get things back to normal. But when I tried it… nothing. Not even a hum.
I pictured him standing there, in the dim morning light, a flashlight clutched in one hand as he went to inspect the generator. Jack was a man who understood machines, who could usually find the problem and fix it. But this? This was something he hadn’t anticipated.
Then it got weirder. I pulled out my flashlight, clicked it on, and… nothing. Just dead.
The frustration in his words was clear, and I could almost feel his hands tightening around the useless flashlight, his mind racing as he tried to make sense of it. It wasn’t just the power in the house. Nothing with a battery, nothing electric, was working. Not even his car.
Not even the damn car would start. I tried a few times, just in case. Even hit the hood, as if that would do something, anything. But the engine just sat there, silent, not even trying to turn over. Nothing was working, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t just a regular power outage. There was no damage, no storm, nothing to explain it. So how?
Jack’s mind was analytical; he wanted answers. But what do you do when you can’t even guess the question? That was the feeling he was wrestling with now, the unsettling realization that he might be in over his head.
I knew what I had to do. Had to get into town, see if anyone else was dealing with the same thing. So I grabbed an apple and a protein bar, the kind of breakfast you eat when you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to think about it. And then, well… I hopped on my old bike. Hadn’t ridden that thing in ages, but with the car out, I didn’t have much of a choice.
I could picture him pedaling down the empty roads, the farmhouses he passed equally quiet, almost abandoned-looking without any signs of life or light. It must have felt eerie, his familiar world transformed into something strange and silent.
When I finally got into town, it was as if the whole place was holding its breath. The streets were empty, people huddled in small groups, all whispering to each other, their faces tight with worry. I spotted John and went over. “Hey, what’s happening?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
I could imagine the look on John’s face, the uncertainty there, as he glanced back and shook his head. “We don’t know,” he replied, his voice low, almost as if he were afraid to say it any louder.
“How is this even possible?” I asked, though I already knew John didn’t have an answer.
“I’m pretty sure it shouldn’t be,” he said. And that was when the mayor stepped up, calling for everyone’s attention.
In his description of the mayor’s announcement, I could hear the disbelief and fear mounting in the crowd. There was a growing sense of urgency, of people searching for someone to blame, or something to hold onto. But the idea of riding fifty miles to the next town, of having to rely on bikes and foot travel just to get help, was almost absurd.
The mayor spoke up, his voice trembling just a little, though he tried to keep it steady. “It seems the radios aren’t working, either. No way to contact anyone. Our only choice, if we want help, is to ride out to the nearest town.”
I pictured the townsfolk, murmuring anxiously to each other, a few gasping when someone reminded them how far the nearest town was. For most people in Ashmont, that fifty miles might as well have been an ocean.
Someone in the crowd yelled out, “The closest town is over fifty miles away!”
The hopelessness in Jack’s words here felt almost contagious, as if the entire town was sinking under the weight of a problem they couldn’t even define. What could they do, really? Who would volunteer to make that journey with no guarantee they’d come back with answers?
A small group finally stepped forward, determined to make the trip in the morning. Chris, one of the volunteers, turned to me and asked, “Wait, don’t you have any horses, Jack?”
I could picture the forced, hopeful smile on Chris’s face, the faint glimmer of optimism, as if a horse might make all the difference.
I shook my head. “No, sorry. Only livestock I’ve got are cows and chickens.”
Jack’s words felt hollow. There wasn’t much comfort to be had in a situation like this. He watched as the group gathered what little supplies they could manage, while he headed back to his bike and began the ride home. I could imagine him pedaling down that empty road again, his thoughts swirling with unanswered questions, each one more unsettling than the last.
When I got back, I told Maria and the kids about the plan. “Tomorrow, we’ll head into town. We’ll stay at a hotel until the power comes back on.” I tried to sound confident, like this was just a temporary inconvenience.
But there was an edge to his words, a hint of desperation. Jack was trying to reassure his family, but he couldn’t even reassure himself. He must have felt it, that creeping sense of dread as he fed the animals, noting how quiet they were, as if even they sensed something was wrong.
As I finished up the chores, it hit me that the fridge wasn’t working, either. And I couldn’t help but think—if all this food goes bad, I’m going to be furious. Just one more damn thing to worry about.
There was an almost resigned tone in those last words, as if Jack had no choice but to laugh bitterly at the absurdity of it all. He’d been preparing for this new season, planting crops, making plans, only to have everything thrown into disarray by something he couldn’t even understand.
The feeling of isolation hung heavy in the air as I finished reading. The situation was spiraling out of control, and Jack’s voice reflected a mix of anger and fear as he clung to the normal routines of his life, even as they were slipping through his fingers. The small-town world he knew was changing, becoming something unfamiliar and dangerous, and he was powerless to stop it.
I closed the journal and stared at the empty fields outside the window, imagining them under the heavy, unnatural darkness that Jack had described. The silence around me felt more oppressive than ever, as if something were waiting, just out of sight.

Chapter Four
This final entry from Jack Twist’s journal was perhaps the most chilling thing I’d read since I’d arrived in Ashmont. The desperation in his words, the panic, the sense of inevitable doom—it all made the hairs on my arms stand up. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine Jack writing those words, alone and frightened, knowing he’d likely never leave that town alive.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 25
Nothing much happened today. The group left on their bikes, and I can only hope they’ll return tomorrow with help. Maria, the kids, and I spent the day in the hotel, watching the hours tick by. The water’s out too, so we’re drinking from water bottles. Another problem we don’t have a solution for.

Jack’s frustration felt almost tangible here, as if he were forcing himself to stay calm despite knowing that everything around him was falling apart.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 26
They didn’t come back today. I keep telling myself it’s probably just slow going, maybe they’re camping out for the night somewhere along the way. Still… something doesn’t feel right.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 27
Another day, and still no sign of the group. People are starting to get nervous—supplies are running low, and the mayor’s been pacing around like he’s got some sort of plan, but none of us believe him. The town’s starting to feel different, like it’s… shrinking.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 28

This was the last entry. Jack’s handwriting was shaky, as if his hands had been trembling as he wrote. I took a breath and continued reading.

If someone finds this journal, please believe me. Please. I know how this must sound, but I have to tell the truth. I went outside this morning, looking for news, hoping to hear that maybe the group had finally made it back. But instead, all I found was frustration, people shouting and pacing, arguing over what little food we had left.
And then, suddenly, one of the radios turned on.

Jack’s words were almost frantic here, his sentences choppy, as if he were reliving the moment as he wrote.

It started with static, just a hiss that filled the room, but then we heard something else. The sound. The same horrible noise from the other night. It was like… like nothing I’d ever heard before, some sort of garbled language, or maybe just noise, but it made my skin crawl. Everyone in the room just froze. We didn’t speak; we didn’t even breathe.
The sound went on for five minutes—five long, horrible minutes—before it cut off again, leaving us in a silence that felt too heavy to bear.
In the afternoon, things took a turn for the worse. Chris came back.
He was alone, staggering into town, and he looked… broken. He wasn’t wearing a stitch of clothing, and he was bleeding. His face was pale, his eyes vacant, like he was somewhere far away. He was muttering, mumbling words none of us could make out, and he looked so hollow, like something had taken every ounce of life out of him.

Jack’s description of Chris painted a haunting picture. I could see him standing there, barely recognizable, his face a twisted mask of pain and confusion. I continued reading, captivated by Jack’s raw fear.

John ran over to him, trying to get some answers. “Oh my God, Chris—what happened to you?!” he asked, his voice trembling.
But Chris just kept muttering, as if he couldn’t even see John. His lips were cracked, his hands shaking. Half of his fingers were missing, and so were his teeth. The doctor finally came over and led him away, but none of us knew what to do. None of us knew what could have done that to a man.
That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing things outside—whispers, maybe, or footsteps, I wasn’t sure. But then… then I heard it. A loud hum, like a plane, but lower, heavier. I looked out the window, and what I saw…

I felt Jack’s terror here as if I were there myself, staring out into the night.

It was a UFO. Just floating there, silent, like it was waiting for something. I thought maybe I was dreaming, but then I saw the others coming out of their houses, one by one, drawn to the light. We all just stood there, staring up at it, until the doors of the ship opened.
What came out of that thing… they weren’t human. They made that same horrible noise we’d heard on the radio, a language that scraped against my mind.
Jeff, the town’s mechanic, was the first to step forward, his fists clenched. “Hey! We don’t know what you’re saying,” he yelled, his voice bold. “So either start speaking English, or I’ll kick your ass!”
One of them moved toward Jeff, fast, reaching out with a hand that looked more like a claw. It grabbed him and pulled him into the ship, just like that. He didn’t scream. He didn’t even struggle. It was like he was in a trance.
And then his son, ran forward with a knife, screaming. He stabbed one of the creatures, and when he pulled the knife out… there was no blood. Nothing. The creature didn’t even flinch.
One of them took out a device—a metal rod, sleek and strange. It touched Will with it, just for a second, and he… he melted. Just collapsed into a puddle right there on the ground. They scooped him up and put what was left of him into a jar, like he was nothing more than a specimen.
People started screaming, running in every direction, and I did too. I ran, as fast as I could, leaving behind everything—my family, my friends, my home. I don’t know why. I just knew I had to get away. I looked back once, and I could see buildings collapsing, the sky filled with smoke. The screams… I can still hear them.
I don’t know how long I ran, but I ended up here, hiding, hoping they won’t find me. I know it’s only a matter of time before they do. I’m leaving this journal here. If anyone finds it, please… tell my story. Tell them what happened here.
Love, Jack Twist.
I sat back, the weight of Jack’s words pressing down on me. Could this really be what happened in Ashmont? The rational part of me wanted to dismiss it, to chalk it up to psychosis, to fear, to anything but the truth. But as I looked out over the empty town, the eerie silence felt heavier, as if the truth of Jack’s story lingered in the air, in the empty streets, in the abandoned buildings.
There was no evidence of an earthquake. No signs of a mass exodus, of struggle, of anything that could explain the disappearance of 5,147 people. Nothing but Jack’s journal.
And that might just be the most terrifying part of all.",2,1732497896.0,TheDarkGathering,0,0.75,False

1gz76al,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gz76al/my_dad_died_and_now_im_all_alone/,"My dad died, and now I'm all alone.","My dad died. 

It's been some months now, but time sort of stopped for me. It's bizarre to me counting how many days it has been and seeing how  time continued for other people, but it just froze in place for me. 

For context to this incoherent messy rant, my mother has not been in my life much and she left when I was only three years old. So, I was raised by my dad, a single father of two. While my brother would move away to a different continent, I stayed here with dad for all these years. Dad was the only friend I really had, and I became a little dependent on him. Other than him, the only person in my life was my long-distance partner.  

When I then developed a panic disorder many years ago, my dad was the only person there for me. He always tried to help. My panic attacks are not as bad these days as they used to be, but stimulants of all sorts tend to trigger panic attacks that make me completely hysterical and for which I've sometimes gone to the hospital for  

But I always had dad, who made things feel okay and safe.

When I had panic attacks, he never really understood what they were or why I was acting insane, but he *always* tried to help. When I got too overwhelmed or was nearing a panic attack, all I needed to do was call dad, and he'd come get me. Day and night, no questions asked.

One time, I had a severe panic attack and every fiber of my being screamed that I wasn't safe here, I had to get away. It was 2am, but I just called dad and he got out of bed and came over  immediately. We drove around a bit, just talking and looking at things and he talked me down and let me sleep at his place.

When I had gotten a little hysterical because I was having a reaction to vaccination, I called dad raving like a lunatic. He drove over immediately and picked me up, and took me  to a restaurant the next town over, and then to a museum to distract me. 

Another time I'd gotten coffee in me and my heart was beating like it was going to explode, but wouldn't you know it, there was dad within minutes, picking me up and saying now's a good time to go shopping donuts a 1.5 hour drive away 

He always took me on these random little excursions to distract me, because he knew I was panicking and needed to get away. And he never judged me for it. Never questioned it, he just knew I wasn't feeling OK, and he wanted to help. And it always made me feel safe 

I thought of this now, because my partner asked why I don't drink coffee anymore. 

The answer to that  is that I don't drink coffee because I'm scared of myself when I get stimulants in me, and I am scared of being scared, and I am scared that when things happen, dad's no longer there. 

My brother lives on the other side of the planet and I don't have any friends. But I always had dad. 

Now, it's 2am on a work night and I'm typing this because I'm just laying here in bed feeling more alone than ever, laying here with that very painful realization:   dad's not going to come swooping in to save the day. He never will again. 

Now, I am all alone.",2,1732497782.0,Vent,2,0.76,False

We’ve grown closer since we first started college and he’s seen me at my best and worst. We’ve gotten out of our prior relationships around the same time and we’ve been single at the same time for a while now. 

While we do BULLY each other, it’s evident that we are very similar with our behavior and humor. So here’s some random things I’ve noticed that really confuse me or bc I’m oblivious that I have no idea what this means

- we have jokingly called each other sweetheart, babe, baby, etc OCCASSIONALLY
- when we sit next to each other he’ll trace my knee with his finger or let our legs cross over each other (he hates being touched) 
- he’ll kill roly polys for me bc they crawl over my stuff and I get scared 
- he’ll over to grab stuff for me I.e. my headphones, my coffee when I leave it in another room, a specific bean bag that he knows I like 
- he’ll wear gloves when it’s cold out, take them off, and has me wear them since he knows I’m severely anemic. He’ll do that over and over again to make the gloves warm for me

1gz70x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1gz70x8/heres_how_to_meet_someone_in_public_in_dallas/,Here's how to meet someone in public in Dallas,"27M, Moved here about 2 years ago from the Chicago area. Was told Dallas is more friendlier than Chicago. The dating scene there is either bars/clubs or dating apps. 

Since I moved here, I was told the people here are nicer. Even on my first day here, I was at a coffee shop and a local Texan striked up a conversation with me while I was in line. At first I was weirded out but the guy was pretty cool, he even ended up buying my coffee. Because of that it put into my mind that Texas is a lot nicer than up north and I decided to start approaching more people in public.

I have tried the dating apps before but I didn't get much luck off it besides a hook up.  Since I was approaching people more I decided to try asking women out. My success rate was about 60% by getting a girls number, now that's just the number. Some of these girls I ended up dating and some just fizzled out but the thing I liked was that there's so many places here to meet people.

Here's what I did to meet people, this is a guys perspective but women can use this to see the other side and use it to their advantage if they want to meet a guy in public.

I mainly stayed in downtownish area/ deep Ellum. I would usually go to places where there was a lot of foot traffic or people, grocery stores like Dallas Farmers market, trader joes, whole foods. Coffee shops like white rhino in uptown, ascension in Addison or eliand in canyon creek. 

Most of these places I would make eye contact with a girl and either she would approach me(you heard right) or I would approach her and ask about(item) in her basket. Eventually, the conversation would lead to me asking for her number(60% chance).

It literally is as simple as that. I've been at ascension coffee and I've brought a book with Mr while I was working and a girl came to my table and asked about my book, I dated her for about 2 months. Once I learned this, I started approaching women who had books with them and even if I didn't know about the book I would just ask them to tell me about it.

I had a girl approach me at whole foods as I was looking through the strawberries and she asked why I was staring so hard at them, I dated her for 4.5 months. 

It really is as simple as going up to someone and asking them literally anything. I've gotten so good at it that I can literally go any girl in public and talk about the most randomist shit and maybe get her number. 

Ladies, don't be afraid of approaching men, I've been approached several times in public and I've been grateful for it.


Another thing is get out of your house. If you want to get better at swimming with sharks you gotta be in the middle of the ocean, not in the desert. Get out of your apartment/house everyday and try to talk to one person, doesn't have to be to get their number but have a conversation. Your mental health will thank you. 


It really is as simple as that, a lot of you will struggle to take the first step but just know once you get past the first or 2nd approach it gets a lot easier and will pay off. Good luck out there.

Edit:  5-6/10 of the girls that I got numbers from, 2 to maybe 3 of them showed up for a first date and usually 1 of them ended up on multiple dates or I ended up dating. It's all numbers, the more you approach, the better your chances imo. Also, yes I would get rejected often, didn't matter, I just kept going. Even some girls who had bfs still gave me their numbers, I didn't follow up.  So there's always a chance no matter how low you think it is.",67,1732497344.0,Dallas,46,0.74,False

He blows his nose in the shower and leaves boogers.

He dries his toothbrush on the bathroom hand towel and uses it to wipe up his beard hair, before putting it back for someone else to dry their hands on.

He eats greasy foods and wipes his hands on his pants, instead of getting a napkin. Or grabs the remote control and leaves grease (or today it was donut glaze) behind on the remote.

He carries his coffee upstairs and drips coffee on the cream colored carpet, and then I have to get on my hands and knees and scrub it up. 

He eats food on a TV tray and brushes all the crumbs onto the floor. That I will have to vacuum. 

Or he mows and then comes inside covered in grass and tracks it all over the house. Which I then have to clean.

Leaves his used disposable tooth picks in the couch cup holder, so he can use them again some other day. I think that is gross, but it's also a concern that the cats will play with them. In which case they end up on the floor, which I don't want to step on them.

I could go on and on, but I don't want to. I wish he would just listen, but he doesn't. And I feel like all I do is nag. I feel like a bad person. I can tell I annoy him. He's a wonderful person.

Belong to the cult no  friends on the outside, what grinds my gears is when you have people from the cult aka my mother in laws friends try and dictate to myself and my husband what we should and shouldn’t do (eg) we should be Christ like and that I should give up my cigarettes & coffee  and  my husband shouldn’t be drinking the horrible energy drinks and alcohol & the fact we need to go out and buy another car, then under the same breath turn around & say when are you coming back to church we miss you and you need to come back to church & help do gods work & we need to start reading the book of moron and the Doctrine and Covenants  &Great pearl  I saw the opportunity and I went full off at her.

1.) I’m a practicing heathen ,her to me oh no your not you have the devil and Satan  in you you should pray and get the the devil out of you  and ask for the Holly spirit to come help you. (me) last time I looked I was a practicing heathen and very happy to be one

2) You don’t get to dictate to myself or my husband  what we can and can’t do you don’t pay my bills nor do you buy my food  or are you my husband or my parents so. No you don’t get the rights to tell us what to do.

3) Both my husband and I have no desire whatsoever to go back to the cult nor do we agree to what the church leaders do to children or Teenagers at any of the cults churches nor do we think it’s right that the moron church brain wash there followers with fake made up nonsense 

So then she had the hid to turn around and  ask my husband when is he coming back to the church that they miss him dearly  (hubby) when he’ll freezes over  also a practicing heathen ( hubby was born into the cult ) where I wasn’t 

Oh don’t worry I’ll make sure to send the elders over and others leaders over to make you change your minds and you will come back to church. Ah heck no you will not be if anyone comes here they will be asked to leave and if they don’t then they  police will be called we have asked for no contact with the church We also have a no contact order against the moron, church  it was signed off by a judge, also please don’t be disrespectful, your in my house,I get it you’re here to see my mother in law but there’s no need to disrespectful   Both myself and my husband we both told you there’s, no way we will ever go back to church ever so there’s, no need to push your religion crap onto us we don’t care. If you keep coming here and disrespecting both myself and my husband you will be not be welcome here until you can respect our beliefs, our rules & our boundaries do I make my self clear, also as stated no one from the church is welcome here as there is no contact orders in-forced

After the friends left there end up being. A massive fight between myself and the mother in law I was being disrespectful and rude to her friends & how dare I  no sorry your friends were being disrespectful to us you know our stands on the moron church and there beliefs you never pulled them up once you are also aware about the  no contact orders that are in place but I let it slide with your friends you know the stands in this house we don’t talk about religion  or politics  as there will be arguments  also this isn’t the first time your best friend has pulled this crap on us either 

Also my mother In law lives with us!

She mentioned that I seemed too young to be drinking coffee. I smiled and told her I’m actually 22. Then she told me I look pretty.

It was such a simple compliment, but it really made my day! It reminded me how small gestures like this can spread so much happiness. I hope I can do the same for others as well. Just wanted to share this little moment of joy. Hope you're all having a great day today. 

P.S. I’ve been dealing with some bad skin recently from waking up abruptly at 3 a.m., so her kind words meant even more to me.

I am going on my first HA cruise next summer. I have done a RC and Princess. 

Questions:
1. I (40sF) am in cabin with 8yo child. Family gave their own separate rooms. Can I get “have it all” package for me, and just get 8yo a quench or soda package?

2. I am interested in the have it all package, but don’t want to worry about bottled water or coffee counting the same as cocktails (I like to try new drinks on cruises, which leads to some drinks getting sampled and discarded if they are not to my taste). I’ve seen ppl say you can upgrade HIA to the Elite drink package (without non alcoholic limits) on board first thing by going to a bar and asking nicely or talking to the bar manager - can anyone confirm this? Is the added cost around $12/day? Is it Ok to do this just for me and keep the 8 yo on quench? Any way to book HIA with Elite drink package ahead of time? I’m not seeing that option on the website

Thank you!

You know, I've spent countless hours researching ergonomic stools with backrests. Why, you ask? Because after years of slouching on uncomfortable chairs, my back was screaming for mercy. So, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, I won't judge), and let's dive into this adventure together. By the end, you'll be ready to say 'bye-bye' to back pain and 'hello' to comfortable seating.
  
  
## The Tale of Two Backs

The Tale of Two Backs: My Personal Experience with Ergonomic Stools

My back pain began one ordinary day when I thought I was just sitting too much, but little did I know that it would turn into a chronic issue. I tried regular stools, but they only worsened my situation. Desperate for relief, I stumbled upon ergonomic stools **with backrests**, and they became my ultimate game-changers.

The difference between regular stools and those with backrests is _crucial_. Regular stools make me feel like I'm constantly leaning forward, but ergonomic stools with backrests support my spine's natural curvature, keeping my upper body aligned, and easing pressure on my back muscles.

The importance of ergonomic stools for back health must be emphasized. Suitable designs help maintain proper posture, provide firm support for your back, and significantly reduce the risk of pain. Beyond discomfort, improper sitting can result in severe long-term health issues, so investing in a quality ergonomic stool with backrest pays off in the long run.

For me, **ergonomic stools with backrests** have been a real blessing – not only do they ease my pain, but they also remind me to pay attention to my posture. I encourage anyone experiencing back pain or stiffness to consider these life-transforming stools. While nobody should have to suffer in silence, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider to understand if an ergonomic stool with backrest is suitable for your needs. So, sit in comfort and say goodbye to back pain with the right support.

## The Anatomy of an Ergonomic Stool

When I first started looking into ergonomic stools with backrests, I had no idea how many features could make a difference. I mean, who knew a stool could be so fancy? One of the standout features is the **adjustable height**. This is a game-changer! I remember sitting on a stool that was too high, and my feet dangled like a kid on a swing. Not comfy at all! With an adjustable height, you can find that sweet spot where your feet are flat on the ground, and your knees are at a nice angle. It’s like finding the perfect pair of jeans—just right!

Then there’s the **swivel mechanism**. Oh boy, this is where the fun begins! Imagine being able to spin around like a kid on a merry-go-round while still being productive. I’ve had stools that didn’t swivel, and let me tell you, it felt like I was stuck in a traffic jam. With a good swivel, you can easily reach for that snack (or your phone) without having to do a full-body twist. 

And let’s not forget the **contoured backrest**. This is where the magic happens. A well-designed backrest hugs your back just right, providing support where you need it most. I once tried a stool with a flat backrest, and it felt like sitting against a brick wall. Ouch! A contoured backrest helps maintain good posture, which is super important if you’re sitting for long periods. So, if you’re on the hunt for an ergonomic stool, keep these features in mind. Your back will thank you!

## The Science Behind the Comfort

**Chapter: The Science Behind the Comfort**

You know the frustration, the tingling and numbness we feel after hours of sitting at a desk. Your back aching, your legs stiff, and the discomfort only amplified by an uncomfortable chair. Those days are over; ergonomic stools with backrest are here. But what's the science behind such comfort, and how do they empower good posture and prevent back pain?

Well, to start, they're designed to maintain a 90-degree angle between the thighs and the calves when sitting, reducing the pressure on your lower back. Plus, they provide ample cushioning that ensures thigh-level weight distribution for instant relief.

Learning from our everyday need to twist and turn in the wrong seats, health studies persuaded multiple experts to define the shape and nature of these stools. Among them, biomechanics icon, Dr. James E. Andrejchik found the perfect balance of soft and firm ridings methods, ensuring adequate lumbar support.

Little did we know, these were the pearls of wisdom the traditional 'cup of tea' chair storage lacked. After all, there's no AC (Adjustable Chair) like an ergonomic stool with backrest.

So, let's raise a glass to those stools that guzzle down the discomfort like a glass of old wine and remind us that sitting can actually be pain-free, thanks to good old-fashioned research.

And while their design might be complex, mimicking the functionality of the human body, their utility remains fairly simple; keeping a straight back, upright posture, no bruised tailbones, and a butt grateful for the day.

## The Great stool Hunt

So, there I was, on a quest that would make Indiana Jones proud: The Great Stool Hunt. My mission? To find the perfect ergonomic stool with a backrest. You know, the kind that makes you feel like you’re sitting on a cloud instead of a medieval torture device. 

First up was the **Herman Miller Sayl**. I plopped down, and wow, it felt like I was being hugged by a friendly octopus. The backrest was supportive, and I could actually feel my spine thanking me. But then, I realized I was so comfortable that I might just fall asleep. I mean, who wants to drool on their desk during a Zoom call? 

Next, I tried the **Vari Ergonomic Stool**. It was like sitting on a pogo stick—fun at first, but after a while, my legs were screaming, “Help!” I felt like I was auditioning for a circus act. 

Then came the **Flash Furniture Ergonomic Stool**. It was decent, but the backrest felt more like a suggestion than actual support. I could almost hear it whispering, “You got this!” while my back was like, “Nope, not today!”

In the end, I learned that finding the right stool is like dating. You have to try a few before you find “the one.” So, keep your sense of humor handy and don’t be afraid to test them out!

## Customizing Your Comfort

Customizing Your Comfort: Adjusting Ergonomic Stools to Fit Your Unique Body Type and Workspace

Finding the perfect ergonomic stool with a backrest can be a game-changer for individuals who spend long hours sitting at work or home. However, even the best stools may need a little tweaking to suit individual preferences and body types. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your ergonomic stool:

**Adjust the Height**First and foremost, adjust the height of your stool to align your hips, knees, and elbows with a straight line. This alignment reduces strain on your back and neck, allowing you to sit comfortably for longer periods. As a general guideline, thighs should be parallel to the floor, and feet should rest flat on the ground or on a footrest if needed.

**Hear the Seat**Ergonomic stools often come with adjustable seat angles to promote healthy posture. Experiment with varying the seat angle to find the most comfortable position for your body. A slight forward tilt shifts your pelvis forward, allowing your spine to maintain a neutral position.

**Pick the Right Backrest**Not all ergonomic stools come with backrests, but if yours does, take advantage of the customizable support. Choose the right level of firmness and adjust the backrest to support your lumbar region. If you find the backrest too firm, try adding a small, comfortable cushion or towel for added support.

**Support Your Workspace**Now that you're set up in your ergonomic stool, ensure you have the right workspace support. Position your screen at eye-level and adjust the distance to reduce eye strain. Keep yourkeyboard and mouse within easy reach to prevent excessive reaching and twisting.

**Make Time for Movement**Finally, remember to take breaks and move around regularly. Stand up, stretch, or walk around every 30 minutes to promote blood flow and prevent stiffness.

By tweaking your ergonomic stool with these adjustments, you'll not only increase your comfort during lengthy sitting sessions but also promote better posture and overall well-being. Don't forget to share your own tips and tricks in the comments below – we all have unique preferences and tricks to share!

## Maintaining Your Ergonomic Investment

Taking care of your ergonomic stool is like nurturing a pet—if you want it to last, you’ve gotta give it some love and attention. I remember the first time I got my fancy ergonomic stool with a backrest. I was so excited that I practically danced around my living room. But then reality hit. After a few weeks, I noticed it was looking a bit worse for wear. Dust bunnies had made it their home, and I was pretty sure I spotted a crumb or two from my late-night snack binge. 

Cleaning it isn’t rocket science, but it does require a bit of finesse. A damp cloth works wonders for the seat and backrest. Just be careful not to soak it. I once thought I could give it a “deep clean” with a garden hose. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. The stool looked like it had survived a monsoon, and I ended up with a soggy mess. 

Adjusting the height and tilt is crucial, too. If you’re slouched like a pretzel, you’re defeating the purpose! I often find myself fiddling with the settings while muttering, “Why can’t I just be comfortable?” Remember, proper posture is your best friend. So, keep your feet flat on the ground and your back straight. Trust me, your back will thank you later!

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks! After all this research and personal experience, I can confidently say that investing in an ergonomic stool with backrest is a game-changer. No more back pain, no more slouching. It's like giving your back a little vacation every time you sit down. Now go forth, find your perfect stool, and remember: your back will thank you later!",1,1732496361.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
