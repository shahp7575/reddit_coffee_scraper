Hook Line: Is Your Ad Missing Its Magic Wand?
Alright, folks, let‚Äôs talk about something that keeps advertisers awake at night. Nope, not the budget (though that‚Äôs a close second)‚ÄîI‚Äôm talking about the Call-to-Action! The beloved CTA. That little nudge that turns ‚ÄúHmm, interesting‚Äù into ‚ÄúTake my money!‚Äù But how does it fit into motion design ads? Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs not just about slapping Buy Now at the end like it‚Äôs a free trial ultimatum.


---

Hook Line: CTA FOMO ‚Äì Fear of Missing Opportunities!
Imagine this: You‚Äôve crafted a stunning 3D animation. The colors pop, the transitions flow smoother than your morning coffee, and the product sparkles brighter than your Zoom-ready ring light. But then‚Ä¶ nothing happens. Why? Because you left your viewers staring at a screen thinking, ‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù Without a CTA, your gorgeous motion design is like a rom-com without a kiss‚Äîit‚Äôs cute, but WHERE‚ÄôS THE PAYOFF?


---

Hook Line: Make It Flashy, but Make It Actionable!
Here‚Äôs the deal: in motion design, your CTA can‚Äôt just exist. Oh no. It has to shine brighter than a supernova. Imagine a 2D explainer video, and suddenly, the screen flips to ‚ÄúClick to Learn More‚Äù with a fun animation. It‚Äôs dynamic. It‚Äôs engaging. It‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúCome on, buddy, you know you‚Äôre curious.‚Äù A plain CTA is like a flat soda‚Äîit‚Äôs still technically there, but who wants it?


---

Hook Line: How Many CTAs Are Too Many?
One, folks. One! If your ad ends with, ‚ÄúVisit our website! Follow us on Instagram! Sign up for our newsletter! Call our hotline! And download our app!‚Äù your audience will click‚Ä¶ away. Keep it simple. A well-placed ‚ÄúGet Yours Now‚Äù or ‚ÄúWatch the Demo‚Äù paired with killer visuals does the trick. Trust me, clarity wins over chaos every time.


---

Hook Line: CTA Trends ‚Äì Swipe Right for Success
Let‚Äôs talk trends. Interactive CTAs are hot. Buttons that bounce, arrows that wiggle, or text that morphs into playful icons‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just design; it‚Äôs CTA choreography! It‚Äôs like your ad is saying, ‚ÄúHey, look, I‚Äôm fun! Now click me, I dare you!‚Äù A well-executed motion design ad makes clicking irresistible, like the last slice of pizza at a party.


---

Hook Line: The Mic Drop Moment
In conclusion, a motion design ad without a CTA is like a comedian without a punchline. Sure, people might enjoy the setup, but they‚Äôll walk away unsatisfied. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShop the Look‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiscover More‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDownload Today‚Äù, your CTA is the star of the final scene. Make it bold, make it clear, and make it click-worthy.


---

Closing: Your Turn to CTA
Now that we‚Äôve had our fun, here‚Äôs your CTA: Got an idea for a killer motion design ad but not sure how to weave in that perfect call-to-action? Let‚Äôs talk! Drop a comment, DM me, or‚Ä¶ you know the drill.

If ever man Gen Ad. lang plan ko bilhin na ticket nun na costs around PHP 3k since madami ako pinagkakagastusan and ako lang nagsusupport sa sarili ko kakagraduate lng din namin this yr, then nitong na sa labas na kami ng moa biglang nagkaroon ng ticket selling, kala ko gen ad lang, yun pala Lower Box Standing na nasa PHP 8250 , nagdecline yung CC ko unfortunately since di na keri for 2 tickets, then ayun tinanggap ko na di na silq makikita tapos yung group of girls na nakabili ng ticket may extra 2 tix sila tapos bigla na kinuha ng friend ko as in hawak niya na and sabi ibenta na samin yun tapos sige daw then kako ‚Äúhala wala ko money now, if CC okay lng sana pero di naman kasi nasesend to as payment sa other person.‚Äù Since hawak na nung friend ko ang ticket and 1 hr na nakalilipas simula magstart ang concert kaya nagmamadali na pumasok then itong friend ko nagano na siya na muna magbabayad and bayaran ko na lang daw siya. Kako sige pero next week ko na mababayaran sa sahod ko (which is this week), g din naman ako since since 2009 pa ako kpop fan and tagal ko din nag-antay ng comeback nila ah kaya go na. So for 2 tix is 16,500 , eh wala na din ako nagawa since papasok na sa arena and ang dami nagaagawan na sa pila, tapos nung na sa loob na kami, bigla ba naman sinabi , ‚ÄúLibre mo ba ‚Äòtong ticket?‚Äù Like napaaa HUUUH ako like gago ? üò≠ siyempre nagdiretsa na ako na Hindi ah. Para namang presyong scalper yun HAHAHAHA since ticket ko lang ang babayaran ko noh. Tapos sinabi niya na sige daw pero bayaran ko pa din daw siya ng 16500 ,since ang nagamit niya kasi na pambayad dun sa nakabili ng ticket is pera nung bf niya na ofw na sinusuportahan naman siya / may allotment siya na natatanggap sa kaniya, and yung 8250 is huhulug hulugan niya na lng daw ako. Kako sige, tapos maya-maya nagsabi na 12500 na lang daw ibayad ko sa kaniya. Sabi ko sige. After concert is kumain kami sa restaurant and ako na gumastos sa lahat, nagtake out pa siya para sa kapatid niya, and pati sa coffee shop and grab namin pauwi ako din since pakunswelo na din since siya muna nagbayad ng ticket eh.

Then nitong nakaraang araw sumahod na ako at sinend ko na yung 12500 sa kaniya, tapos nagmeet pa kami after as usual kumain kami, then ako ulit gumastos kako libre ko. Tas after nun nag-aya siya magcoffee shop ulit and meron kasi siya attitude na ‚Äúikaw na muna magbayad te send ko/abot ko sayo later bayad ko.‚Äù Ako naman go lang ako, then nag-aya siya ulit magpunta naman kami sa ibang mall, eh wala mabook na angkas/move it since plan namin ganun na lng para mas maakamura, then nagbook siya bigla grab and may nagaccept agad, medyo makapit lng actually yung mall na pinuntahan namin pero since in demand /traffic umabot 550 pesos ü•≤ tapos yan na naman siya na ‚Äúte ikaw muna magbayad.‚Äù Sabi ko gooo.

At natapos na ang araw na hindi niya ako binayaran. 

Okay naman sana yung mga ganun, pero iniisip ko pa din yung binayad ko na 12500 na imbes na 8250 lang sa tix since hindi niya na nabring up kailan niya ibabalik yung extra na binayad ko, kasi di ko alam kung makakalimutin ba siya or what pero it happened so many times kasi noon panlang dun pa lang sa ‚Äúikaw na magbayad sa ganito ganyan send ko later payment ko.‚Äù Hinahayaan ko lng yung ganun eh. Pero yung sa tix talaga medyo napasobra yung gastos kaya nanghihinayang ako if di niya babalik man yung sobra na binayad ko sa kaniya. Mind you may internship kami next yr na yung total fees need namin bayadan is 200k+ and binayadan na ng bf niya yung program fee niya lahat, and ako wala gagastos para sakin kundi ako lang kaya ako na lahat gumagastos para sakin kaya need ko doble kayod sa work talaga. Kaya sobrang improtante sakin yung bawat nilalabas na pera huhu kasi nakakahinayang din.

May I ask ano kaya magandang approach na hindi siya maooffend about dun üò≠, kasi pag ibang tao kasi gumagawa nun sa kaniya nagagalit siya and ayoko naman mawala magalit siya sakin.

I know Beth hates to see me coming.

Yes, I finally decided to stop gatekeeping my therapist‚Äôs name. Just calling her ‚Äúmy therapist‚Äù was getting pretty old.

If you‚Äôre new, you can read what I‚Äôve been covering in my therapy sessions: [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/comments/1gpe8cd/guide_to_im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police/)

And with the shit-show the last day has been, I‚Äôm *definitely* overdue for one.

‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù I instructed Sage through the phone, ‚Äútake deep breaths. Are you able to come down to the station?‚Äù

She let out an incredulous laugh, ignoring my advice. ‚ÄúAre you *nuts?* You want me to lead this psycho right to you while he‚Äôs following me and know I‚Äôm on to him? He‚Äôd kill me before I got the chance!‚Äù

Dustin rolled his eyes, continuing to apply pressure on my wrist. For such a small cut it was bleeding a lot. Must‚Äôve nicked an artery pretty good.

I sighed, partially out of breath from the blood loss. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your twenty?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù Ms. Walker‚Äôs voice sounded very confused over the phone.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I mumbled under my breath. Forgot I was talking to a civilian for a second there. Dustin shot me a stern look as he pressed his lips into a thin line, the pressure around my wound increasing. I winced. He was not very happy with me in that moment. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your location? Where are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said understandingly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Old Brooks Motel on the edge of town.‚Äù

I motioned for Dustin to start walking for the parking lot, it would take us about fifteen minutes to get over there if we sped and had the lights on. After one last peek into the interrogation room, I followed after him.

What I saw in there is now burned into the back of my eyelids. Rudy‚Äôs eyes were glowing red and bloodshot, seemingly trained on me, disturbingly full of this primal hunger and lust. For what, I could only guess.

‚ÄúOkay, Sage I need you to be very careful,‚Äù I spoke into my phone, shaking those eyes out of my head. They looked too familiar and I couldn‚Äôt deal with the memories associated with them.

I pushed the side door to the precinct open, squinting at light of the early afternoon sun. ‚ÄúMy partner and I are on the way to you now,‚Äùthe passenger and driver‚Äôs side door of the liftback slammed shut synchronously. Dustin tuned the key in the ignition, causing the old hunk of junk to roar to life. ‚ÄúWe have the man you described in custody, so whoever is out there with you is not him. Find somewhere safe and stay put. Whatever you do, stay on the line.‚Äù

A tense moment of silence passed as she registered my words. ‚ÄúWha-?‚Äú she started to say, but then the most chilling, blood-curdling, scream I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of hearing erupted into my eardrums.

My heart sank into my stomach as the call abruptly ended. I looked over to my partner with worry, clutching my pounding chest. Dustin nodded, pushing the petal to the metal.

It took approximately eleven minutes for us to get to the Old Brooks Motel from the station, with Dustin managing to shave off a whole four minutes from what I projected. Four minutes that could be the difference between life and death.

Two cars occupied the gravel parking lot when we arrived. Winchester is one of those towns tourists typically drive through, not spend the night in. Meaning, the motel rarely saw any business. With how run down the place was, I wouldn‚Äôt want to spend the night there either. The building‚Äôs white paint was chipped and yellow from years of neglected upkeep. The railings were rickety at best, shoddy at worst. Most of the chain locks on the doors didn‚Äôt work, if they had locks at all.

In all honesty, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if the serial killer really was hanging around over here.

After parking, Dustin scanned the desolate parking lot for any signs that could tell us what went down here. Before getting out of the car he gave me a once over. Suddenly, he slammed his fist on top of the dashboard. The glove compartment popped open, revealing a treasure trove of random items. Among them was a thick roll of white medical gauze. ‚ÄúWrap that up,‚Äù he ordered, pointing at his jacket that was still wrapped around my arm. ‚ÄúThere might be a cookie or something in there too. Eat it and stay here while I check things out,‚ÄùDustin then slammed his door. I watched him walk into the reception office as my mouth hung open.

He was really pissed with me. Looking back at it now, what I did *was* pretty dumb and reckless. He had every right to be cross with me. After properly bandaging myself up, I tossed the bloodied police jacket in the back seat, making a mental note to get it dry cleaned for him. It was the least I could do after all.

Rummaging around the glove compartment, I found a couple stale fortune cookies. Doing as Dustin said, I cracked and ate both of them. One was fortune-less. The other read:

*An unsettling truth approaches; trust the whispers of your intuition.*

I shrugged my shoulders, tossing the scrap of paper into the open compartment before shutting it, doing my best to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

A few minutes later Detective Davidson returned to the car. ‚ÄúFound this,‚Äù he said, showing me a cracked iPhone. ‚ÄúAnd a body.‚Äù

I perked up in my seat, giving him a look.

‚ÄúRelax, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hers. The house keeper was stuffed behind the front desk, throat torn out.‚Äù

I lifted an eyebrow curiously. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the manager?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find out, shall we?‚Äù He said, a bleak smile forming on his lips.

It didn‚Äôt take us long to find the motel manager. He‚Äôs not the serial killer if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre thinking. No, after a little investigating we found his foot sticking out of an ajar door on the first floor.

‚ÄúYou better call forensics,‚Äù I said, shoving my nose into my elbow to escape from the heavy metallic scent. Dustin did the same before stepping out to make the phone call.

The hotel manager‚Äôs skin was gaunt and pale, presumably due to the puddle of blood he was lying in. This kill was brutal and messy, much like the other ones. Only there was something different. This kill seemed to have been done out of impatience. I could see tell by the manager‚Äôs expression. You could see the other vic‚Äôs knew what was going on. They experienced their murder, we‚Äôre alive for their last moments. The manager though, his face was calm, peaceful almost. Like he had no idea that death was waiting for him.

Another body laid on the bed closest to the back wall. It was another man, more decayed than the manager. A wooden stake stuck out of hit chest like a gnarly splinter. His throat had been ripped out as well. The body was so bloated I couldn‚Äôt really tell much else. If the body wasn‚Äôt dust by now, that meant he‚Äôd been staked as a preventative measure.

Something about this was starting to feel off. I think deep down I realized it back at the precinct. This constant nagging feeling had been gnawing at the back of my mind ever since that phone call. If Rudy wasn‚Äôt our killer, then who was?

The only way to answer that question was to investigate the scene of the crime.

‚ÄúNobody else is here and Forensics is on the way,‚Äù Dustin announced as he re-entered the room, stepping around the body,‚Äù so is the coroner.‚Äù

I nodded solemnly as he tossed me a pair of latex gloves. I slipped them on and the two of us began snooping around, looking for anything that might tell us where Sage could‚Äôve been taken.

The room looked like a standard motel room. Mini fridge, tv, dresser, and two queen beds. The room was mostly tidy, except for the blood and bodies. The sheets on the empty bed were strewn about and wrinkled, drenched in dark fluids. An old shoe box sat neatly on the end. The wicker doors of the closet had been pushed open, revealing its contents. Besides hanging clothes, pictures and news paper clippings were pinned to the back wall. A red string connected the different photographs and articles together like one big makeshift suspect board.

Upon closer examination, most of the clothes seemed to be some kind of costumes or disguises. The wardrobe ranged from fancy suits to clergymen outfits, even police uniforms.

Dustin tipped over the shoe box while I traced my finger against the red string, trying to piece together the same puzzle the owner of the string was.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù he muttered, causing me to turn my attention away. Dustin stood at the edge of the bodiless bed with his hand resting on his hips, chewing the skin off his lips as he thought.

Different state IDs, driver‚Äôs licenses, social security cards, and even some law enforcement badges had been living in that box. I took a closer look at them, they were all fake but could pass as real to the untrained eye. Different names were plastered on each of the identifying cards but the photos remained the same. They were all pictures of Rudy.

‚ÄúJust who is this guy?‚Äù I asked aloud, scratching the side of my head.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a monster hunter,‚Äù Jane explained when we got back to the precinct. Davidson and I had just finished debriefing her on everything we found at the motel.

I scrunched my nose at the title. I‚Äôd heard of hunters before but never encountered one in real life. In my opinion they were idiots, taking the law of the land into their own hands- playing judge, jury, and executioner. Both human and supernatural laws were set in place for a reason. People that think they‚Äôre above them and The Court were messing with fire and putting themselves in needless peril.

Memories of Rudy filtered through my mind. The last thing on my mind when I thought of was *monster hunter*. He didn‚Äôt really look like the type to be a revenant either, but here we are.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt alone, either,‚Äù Dustin said, tossing a photo he took from his pocket in front of Jane and I.

‚ÄúDustin!‚Äù I gasped, my eyes widening in shock. ‚ÄúYou took something from a crime scene?!‚Äù

He scoffed incredulously. ‚ÄúYou really want to lecture *me* on protocol right now?‚Äù

I stuttered for a second, trying to think of a comeback, but ultimately stood there. Flustered

‚ÄúGo ahead Jane, why don‚Äôt you ask Lucky about those bandages on her wrist?‚Äù Dustin goaded, crossing his arms into his chest.

‚ÄúWe can unpack all of *that* later,‚Äù Jane said, turning to the two of us and motioning her hands in circles. ‚ÄúBut right now, we need to focus on this.‚Äù Her well manicured nail tapped on the photo Dustin had taken.

‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs the dead guy we found on the bed,‚Äù I pointed out, examining the photo. It was a Polaroid of three dudes in a bar. I recognized the white man‚Äôs dirty blonde hair. He stood on the left side, drunkenly smiling. On the right was a taller, older, and scruffier version of Rudy. One arm was wrapped around both of the other boys and the other hand was outstretched with a beer in it. He seemed to be shouting something. Rudy was in the middle with his arms crossed, looking like he didn‚Äôt want to be there. Though he smiled cheekily, as if he was secretly enjoying himself.

‚ÄúThat only leaves this guy unaccounted for,‚Äù Dustin said referring to the man on the right. ‚ÄúMonster Hunter turned supernatural serial killer,‚Äù he chuckled to himself, ‚Äúwho‚Äôd-a thought?‚Äù

I had to admit, it was bizarre, but becoming a supernatural will do weird things to you. ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs a revenant too?‚Äù

He stroked his thumb on the bottom of his lip, debating about it. ‚ÄúSeems like it. Not as put together as Rudy though.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùJane said distantly, lost in thought. That look she gets when a stroke of brilliance hits suddenly shown on her face. I furrowed my brows curiously, watching as she analyzed the photo closer. ‚ÄúGuys what if, and this is a very big *if*, we were wrong? *I* was wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù Dustin asked.

‚ÄúAs you said, who would think that a monster hunter would become a supernatural killer?‚Äù Jane vaguely elaborated. ‚ÄúWhat if these murders were staged to look like they‚Äôd been committed by a revenant, but were actually committed by someone and something else entirely?‚Äù

The gears were turning in his head, but Dustin still wasn‚Äôt getting it. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, something happened or went wrong on their last hunt, leading to the death of the one guy and Rudy becoming a revenant.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the snow ball started to roll for me.

‚ÄúAnd where do revenant‚Äôs come from? What else drinks blood and has teeth sharp enough to rip out throats?‚Äù She said slowly, like Dustin and I were school children,

‚ÄúVampires,‚Äù I said, getting an epiphany.

Jane shot me a pleased smile. Slowly, Dustin‚Äôs eyes lit up as well, coming to the same conclusion.

‚ÄúYou said your witness is missing, right?‚Äù She asked urgently, clapping her hands together.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Dustin said, fishing her phone out of his other pocket, ‚Äúwe found this at the crime scene, why?‚Äù

Jane reached her hand out to take it. Dustin gently placed it on the open palm of her hand. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find out where this Sage Walker lives.‚Äù

Finding the residence registered to the Sage Walker who owned the phone was simple. We just had to use the phone number linked with the provider to look up the account, and boom we had our home address.

What wasn‚Äôt so simple was the scene we found once we got there. After ringing the doorbell multiple times and discovering the front door to be unlocked, we announced our presence and went in.

Lying in the foyer was the rotted, mangled up body of an old woman. She‚Äôd been drained dry of her blood as she died, evident by the bite marks lining down her arms and legs. Leaving her corpse to partially mummify without the liquid. The body had been there a long time judging by the state of decomposition and how deflated it was.

Jane threw herself out the door and started to dry heave in the bushes from the smell. Dustin and I who were more used to it by now, powered through and searched the house. We let the stench of death radiate out through the open front door.

In the living room, resting in one of those decorative key holder bowls, was the woman‚Äôs wallet. I picked it up and opened it. The drivers license photo resembled what was left of the poor woman‚Äôs face. The ID belonged to Sage Walker.

I slammed the wallet shut and kicked the coffee table it had been on. ‚ÄúGod dammit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah, what‚Äôs going on over here?‚Äù Dustin asked, coming over to investigate.

With a heavy, defeated sigh, I handed the blue and white Vera Bradley wallet over to him. A non-committal, ‚Äúhmm,‚Äù left his mouth.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm so stupid!‚Äù I exclaimed, rubbing my temples. ‚ÄúStupid enough that I couldn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôve been talking to a maniac this whole time! I messed up‚Ä¶ big time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Dustin said softly, putting his hand on my shoulder. Instead of shrugging it off like I normally did, I let it rest there for a moment, feeling comforted by it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

I sniffled, holding back tears, sweeping a loose strand of hair behind my ear and catching sight of the bandage on my wrist. *God what going on with me? I need to get my shit together!*

Suddenly, somewhere, a phone started ringing. Dustin removed his hand off my shoulder to pat himself down and see if it was his. I hate to admit it felt cold and uncomfortable without it there.

Quickly pushing that thought away, I too started to search and see if the ringing cellphone belonged to me.

‚ÄúUh, guys?‚Äù Jane said as she re-entered the real Sage Walker‚Äôs house. The ringing persisted, only growing louder as she got closer. When Jane entered the living room, she stuck the cracked iPhone out like it contained the plague. ‚ÄúI think one of you should answer this.‚Äù

I immediately grabbed the phone, already knowing who was calling despite the caller ID saying unknown number.

After a hesitant tap, the phone finally stopped ringing. Another tap and the call went on speaker, broadcasting everything to the room.

‚ÄúSo, I see you finally figured out how to do your job. Good for you,‚Äù the voice on the other side of the phone was deeper than the first time we‚Äôd talked. Not as high pitched or uppity, but confident and velvety smooth. It was almost alluring.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an imposter,‚Äù I seethed. ‚ÄúYou lied to me. Made it sound like you were kidnapped over the phone, when in reality you were just buying yourself more time.‚Äù

Fake Sage giggled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly *is* your game?‚Äù Dustin asked, interjecting himself. ‚ÄúWhy are you going around slaughtering people posing as a revenant?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I had to,‚Äù she said coldly.

‚ÄúYou had to?‚ÄùI scoffed, ‚ÄúBecause of you, six people are dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? Well, because of him my whole nest is dead!‚Äù She retorted, angrily. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt doing anything wrong! We were bloodsober for as long as we could. Then, we drank from livestock, never human! They came and hunted us down one by one. They were weak, but I was strong! Strong enough to fight back.‚Äù

Morbid curiosity took over as I asked, ‚ÄúWhy? Why turn him?‚Äù

A, rueful, evil chuckle erupted from fake Sage as she answered. ‚ÄúI simply want to see him suffer. I was delighted by how he squirmed as I killed his friend, then poured my blood down both of their throat‚Äôs to turn them. The third hunter stabbed the friend in the chest, but I took care of him quickly. Then he came back crying those black bloody revenant tears and everything fell into place. I‚Äôd frame him for the murders and he‚Äôd die just like my nest. Hunted. Tortured. Then ultimately, brutally killed. Since you‚Äôve already got him in custody, I‚Äôll leave the rest to you.‚Äù

Tense, electric, silence filled the air after the vampire on the other side of the phone spilled her guts.

Not being able to say anything else, I went,‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

A heavy breath came from the phone. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to know. But, don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be sticking around long enough for you to find out.‚Äù In signature fake Sage fashion, she abruptly hung up.

Contrary to her belief though, not before we could trace where the call had come from.

Dumb vamp.

While she was on the line, Jane had been able to use her magic and bypass all the metadata to figure out where the call had originated from. Do we have the best profiler or what?

After she relayed the location, Dustin and I booked it for the car. Sage had already told us of her plans to disappear. Time was of the essence.

Dustin and I raced to beat the sunset. She‚Äôd be able to move faster and farther under the cover of darkness. Our escapade to the old woman‚Äôs house took us to the complete opposite side of town where the abandoned warehouse she‚Äôd called from was.

The sun had just barely slipped below the horizon when we reached the warehouse. The building was decrepit and old, surrounded on all sides except one by forest.

Claire de Lune played again as Dustin‚Äôs phone rang. It was Jane calling. He hurriedly clicked a button on his phone and the ringing ceased, attempting to stop ourselves from alerting the target of our presence. It rang again, but he turned his phone completely off.

She tried my cell next. If we weren‚Äôt right outside the den of a vampiric serial killer about to fade away into the unknown, I might‚Äôve answered. Instead, I turned my phone off as well.

Like in our drills, Dustin and I were armed and equipped with wooden stake loaded crossbows in under a minute. After giving each other an understanding nod, we motioned to move in.

We were stopped in our tracks as a crunch came from the tree line. An image of The White Wolf flashed in my mind and I jumped, training the crossbow in the area the sound came from. Dustin covered my six while still paying attention to the thing in the brush.

*Crunch. crunch, crunch.* Then‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRudy?‚Äù I asked, perplexed enough to stop aiming my crossbow. How the hell did he escape?

He brushed mine and Dustin‚Äôs existence off, instead looking straight ahead at the warehouse. Rudy rolled up his grey jumpsuit sleeves, his fangs distended and eyes glowing a chillingly blood red that seemed even scarier in the light of dusk. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine,‚Äù he stated evenly before running off and barging in with inhuman speed.

Oh shit‚Ä¶

1gxsr9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gxsr9m/how_to_choose_the_perfect_rug_for_every_room_in/,How to Choose the Perfect Rug for Every Room in Your Home,"Rugs are more than just floor coverings‚Äîthey're design statements that can set the tone for an entire room. The right rug can transform your space, adding warmth, texture, and personality. But with so many options available, how do you choose the perfect rug for every room in your home? Whether you‚Äôre drawn to a soft [cotton rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug), stylish [blue and white rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/blue-and-white-rug), or versatile [round rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs), this guide will help you make an informed decision.

# 1. Assess the Room‚Äôs Needs

Each room in your home serves a unique purpose, and your rug should complement its functionality and style.

* **Living Room**: Often the heart of the home, the living room benefits from rugs that define space and provide comfort. A **round rug for the living room** can soften harsh lines and create a cozy seating area.
* **Bedroom**: Prioritize comfort here. A plush **cotton rug** is an excellent choice for underfoot softness as you step out of bed.
* **Dining Room**: Choose a rug that‚Äôs easy to clean and can handle food spills. Flatweave rugs are durable and low-maintenance.
* **Kitchen**: Opt for smaller, washable rugs that add a splash of style without overwhelming the space.
* **Bathroom**: Look for water-resistant materials to prevent mold and mildew.

# 2. Choose the Right Material

Rug materials affect texture, durability, and maintenance. Some popular options include:

* **Cotton Rugs**: Lightweight, easy to clean, and perfect for casual spaces like bedrooms or playrooms. Cotton rugs come in various designs, including trendy **blue and white rugs** for a fresh, modern aesthetic.
* **Wool Rugs**: Durable and insulating, ideal for high-traffic areas like living rooms and hallways.
* **Jute or Sisal Rugs**: Natural and eco-friendly, great for adding texture to minimalist spaces.
* **Synthetic Rugs**: Stain-resistant and affordable, perfect for homes with kids or pets.

# 3. Consider Color and Pattern

Color can dramatically influence a room‚Äôs ambiance.

* **Blue and White Rugs**: These are classic choices that evoke a serene and coastal vibe. Perfect for living rooms, bedrooms, or even entryways, they offer versatility and timeless charm.
* **Neutral Tones**: Beige, gray, or off-white rugs provide a clean canvas and can balance bold furniture or vibrant wall colors.
* **Bold Patterns**: Use patterned rugs to inject personality into a neutral room.

When pairing rugs with furniture, ensure the colors harmonize. For instance, a **blue and white rug** pairs beautifully with wooden furniture or white upholstery.

# 4. Select the Right Shape and Size

The shape and size of your rug can define your room‚Äôs layout.

* **Round Rugs for Living Rooms**: These work wonderfully in small or square living rooms, creating a focal point under a coffee table or accent chair.
* **Rectangular Rugs**: Ideal for large spaces, dining tables, or hallways.
* **Runner Rugs**: Perfect for narrow spaces like hallways or kitchens.

When choosing a size, ensure the rug anchors the furniture. In living rooms, all front legs of your sofa and chairs should rest on the rug. In dining rooms, the rug should extend at least 24 inches beyond the table to accommodate chairs.

# 5. Prioritize Maintenance

A rug's beauty is only as lasting as its care. Keep these tips in mind:

* **Cotton Rugs**: Easy to toss in the washing machine for hassle-free cleaning.
* **Blue and White Rugs**: Vacuum regularly and spot-clean spills to maintain their crisp appearance.
* **High-Traffic Areas**: Use rugs with stain-resistant fibers or consider using a rug pad to prolong the rug‚Äôs life.

# 6. Layer Rugs for Style

Layering is an on-trend technique that adds depth to your decor. Try pairing a neutral jute rug with a **blue and white cotton rug** for a chic, layered look.

# Conclusion

The perfect rug ties a room together, offering both practicality and style. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to the simplicity of a **cotton rug**, the elegance of **blue and white rugs**, or the unique charm of **round rugs for living rooms**, consider the room‚Äôs function, your style, and the rug's maintenance needs. With these tips, you'll create spaces that are as comfortable as they are visually stunning.",1,1732341027.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I got it for $5 at Walmart near the perfume and beauty section. It was located in the stand alone shelves in the middle of the aisle where the perfume gift sets are located. 

I definitely pick up the maple and the sugar adds a dash of sweetness but the coffee is center stage in this fragrance. The coffee note is photorealistic bold black coffee that almost leans into espresso territory (there‚Äôs a smooth bitterness). 

Unfortunately, although I loved this on the back of my hand, wearing it on my clothes and on my body made me realize that a photorealistic prominent black coffee/espresso note is not for me. It feels like too much and I feel like I smelled as if I had spilled coffee on myself üòÖ, which is funny because I love Skylar Vanilla Sky which smells like a cappuccino and I don‚Äôt feel like that smells like I spilled a cappuccino on myself.

I am currently 2 weeks PP. Had a 2nd emergency cesarean, 1st was a failed induction. Had some complications (uterine atony) during surgery and lost 2.4l of blood. My HB levels halved in the days that I was in hospital. When I got home the surgeon called me and said that if I feel tired or hace heart palpitations I need to go to the emergency room and get a blood transfusion. 

Our 1st is 22m old, and she is a mommy's girl. 

So before baby was born I decided that it would be good if my in-laws come to stay with us instead of my parents. I was wrong. 
The big reasoning was that our girl loves her granny so much. She would go to her rather than me. I thought that would be good. 

Dad stayed for a week and mom is staying for a month then she swops with my mom. And I can't freaken wait. 

I'm currently sitting nap trapped on the sofa with baby on my chest and girl watching Bluey. MIL went upstairs, she had a bad back before coming (I wasn't aware of that, would've changed my mind about them coming), and she fell twice in one week, once coming into the house and last night in the bath. If my mom was here I would have coffee in the one hand and food ready to eat. 

Since last weekend I've been taking over from her, with regards to all things toddler. I bath her at night and put her to bed. Cause mom complains about her back, she slept with the toddler while I was in the hospital. I was just done with the complaining. I also take the toddler to school, cause MIL won't drive, she can walk (we stay 5 min drive from the school) but her back. 

This was not what I imagined this second postpartum would be, I should still be in bed right now. She washes the dishes, but that's about it. I cook dinner and have to make sure she eats during the day, cause she doesn't. Guess I'm not the one recovering from abdominal surgery... 

I love my in-laws, I usually have minimal complaints. But I do regret having them here. It was my decision so I can't complain to anyone about it.

I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

1gxsdl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gxsdl9/aita_for_wanting_to_switch_gyms_because_of_one/,AITA for wanting to switch gyms because of one insecure girl?,"So I(24F) work overnight shifts and it's easier for me to go in after my shift, early in the morning. I like the ambiance in the morning (7-11am) everyone is focused on their workouts  very minimal socialising and that helps me lock in and  stay consistent.  Im a very reserved person and keep to myself, people do approach me here and there but only because of one girl.

She is the receptionist at my gym and would constantly compliment me when i would come in, then randomly she would just start yapping about stuff i couldn't care too much about, however our interactions were always very one sided, it was just her venting to me about her problems. She would constantly share really intimate details about her relationship and her insecurities and it wasn't with just me, she would talk to anyone that would listen and ask about why her bf would say certain things and etc. At some point (very early into our interaction) she would show me her diary detailing things about  her sex life and how her bf would compare her to his ex. 

Im certain she just wanted attention anywhere she could get it. We once went for coffee with another girl and she was just quiet and overthinking and then we went for coffee just me and her and she would talk about herself for the entirety of the time (we were out for 2 hours at most). 

In the gym, I would be trying to mind my business, working out alone and she would ""join"" me, interrupt me during my sets to hold weights for her while she chats with other people and it got very frustrating because  I'm at the gym to work out and improve my own self.

The other day, i went up to her to greet her and she was balling in tears in the middle of the gym, i was sitting with her for 40minutes if not more cause she wanted consoling. She was crying because her bf saw her eating a granola bar and called her out for cheating on her diet and not losing weight and ofc at some point mentioning the ex for whatever reason.
I was very annoyed that i spent my time over something so stupid.

She constantly says to me that i seem like someone who has their sh*t together and that she likes asking for my advice/opinion. I literally dont. I've  started distancing myself, changing the time i workout at the gym (which isnt very productive for me), the last i spoke to her i invited her to a yoga class thats offered so she can get grounded (mind and body) and she never showed up, texted me at the last second that she wouldnt make it. I haven't replied that text. Anytime i post anything on my IG story she always likes it or dms me ""its not allowing me to like it"" as if she wants me to know that she sees my story (i dont care to see who views my story), im barely active on social media anyways.

Point being, i get extremely emotionally and mentally drained after every interaction with her.

Because she works at the gym, other members are familiar with her, and after seeing me with her they would greet me/small talk. This one older gentleman, would tell me in the middle of my core workouts that the receptionist could kick my ass in boxing that shes stronger than she seems as a way to boost her self esteem but all i could think was ""... okay?"" Another older man would start asking me about my job, education and hobbies and essentially criticise me for not working an office job and every time he saw me ask if i switched jobs or if i joined a college. I dont see how my life decisions have anything to do with him. 


Since I've distanced myself,  I notice i get weird energy/stares at the gym. The other front desk people dont greet me or greet me back, I wouldnt be surprised if she spoke to them about me the way she speaks to others about her bf.

Currently looking to cancel my membership as soon as tomorrow and sign up at a different gym.

1gxsc0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gxsc0h/how_to_style_a_sofa_table_for_my_living_room/,How to style a sofa table for my living room?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with styling a sofa table since I recently transformed my living room and learned quite a bit along the way. Trust me, it's not as complicated as some interior design shows make it look!

First things first, I found that the key is choosing the right sofa table. After lots of research and comparing different options, I discovered some amazing choices on Amazon (you can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/sofa). The height of your sofa table should be about the same as your couch's back or slightly lower ‚Äì this creates a clean, balanced look.

Here's what worked really well for me:

1. Layer Different Heights
I started by placing taller items like table lamps or vases at the ends of the table. Then, I added medium-height decorative pieces like photo frames or small potted plants in the middle. This creates visual interest and draws the eye across the table.

2. Rule of Three
I grouped my decorative items in threes ‚Äì it's a classic design trick that just works. For example, I put a lamp, a stack of coffee table books, and a small succulent together. The odd number creates a more natural, less staged look.

3. Add Personal Touch
Don't just copy what you see in magazines! I added some family photos and a vintage box I found at a flea market. These personal items make the space feel more lived-in and tell your story.

4. Consider Function
My sofa table isn't just for show ‚Äì I made sure to leave space for practical items like remote controls and coasters. I found some stylish storage solutions on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that help keep everything organized while looking great.

5. Seasonal Updates
Here's a cool tip: I switch out some decorative items seasonally. During fall, I add warm-colored candles and small pumpkins. In spring, I bring in fresh flowers and lighter accessories. It keeps the space feeling fresh and current.

6. Lighting Matters
Table lamps aren't just functional ‚Äì they create amazing ambiance in the evening. I chose lamps that complement my room's style but also provide enough light for reading.

7. Don't Overcrowd
This was my biggest lesson: less is more! I started with too many items and gradually removed things until it felt right. You want some breathing room between pieces ‚Äì it looks more expensive and intentional that way.

Some Quick Don'ts:
- Don't block walking paths
- Avoid anything too tall that blocks conversation
- Skip fragile items if you have kids or pets running around
- Don't feel pressured to fill every inch of space

I'm really happy with how my sofa table turned out, and these guidelines helped me create a look that's both stylish and practical. Remember, your space should reflect your personality while remaining functional. It might take some trial and error, but that's part of the fun!

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to share your own sofa table styling tips! I'm always looking to learn new ideas from this awesome community.",1,1732339442.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1gxsbwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1gxsbwb/clickbait_from_hell/,Clickbait from Hell,"Jared laughed as he turned the ornate brass key in the lock, a triumphant grin splitting his face. His roommate had bet him $500 he wouldn‚Äôt go through with it. Summoning a demon? Who even believed in that stuff? But Jared had a knack for theatrics and a mean streak of arrogance that loved to prove people wrong. The ancient tome he‚Äôd purchased online‚Äîbound in what some Etsy seller claimed was goat leather‚Äîreeked of mildew and, frankly, fabrication. Yet its pages brimmed with ominous sigils and incantations written in what appeared to be blood. It was perfect for the prank.

He set the book on the coffee table and cracked open a cheap bottle of whiskey. As the amber liquid burned its way down his throat, Jared kicked back on the couch, mentally crafting the perfect Instagram video. He imagined himself lighting candles, chanting nonsense, and then, with perfect timing, releasing a hidden smoke bomb to ‚Äúprove‚Äù he‚Äôd summoned something supernatural. His followers would eat it up.

Grinning, he began assembling the setup. The pentagram, scrawled with chalk on the hardwood floor, was sloppy but legible. Candles‚Äîtea lights from the dollar store‚Äîflickered around its edges. He arranged a handful of trinkets to complete the aesthetic: a chicken bone, some rusty nails, and a broken watch he‚Äôd found in a junk drawer.

With the stage set, Jared dimmed the lights, started recording on his phone, and flipped to a random page in the book. The words were an incomprehensible swirl of ancient script. Laughing, he began to read.

‚ÄúZ‚Äôoth rakhal‚Ä¶‚Äôishvar tannik‚Ä¶torrah saniveh‚Äî‚Äù

The air grew heavier with each syllable. Jared paused, startled. His skin prickled. The temperature plummeted, and the tiny flames of the candles flared green, casting eerie shadows across the room.

‚ÄúNice touch,‚Äù he muttered, glancing at the smoke bomb still tucked in his pocket. He hadn‚Äôt set it off.

A sudden, guttural sound rolled through the room. Not the hum of distant traffic or the settling of wood, but a sound alive with purpose‚Äîa low, gravelly chuckle. Jared‚Äôs bravado faltered. His eyes darted around the room.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he called, voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs messing with me?‚Äù

No reply. Just silence, vast and oppressive.

He stepped back from the pentagram, his hand brushing against the book. It fell closed with a muffled thud, and the noise triggered a wave of nausea. The room swam, and the green candlelight flared again.

Something moved in the shadows.

‚ÄúStop screwing around!‚Äù Jared yelled, though his voice cracked halfway. The whiskey-fueled courage was rapidly draining.

Then it stepped into view. Eight feet tall, with obsidian skin that rippled like liquid tar, the entity loomed above him. Its face was an abomination of swirling voids, ever-shifting and hungry. Its voice was a chorus of whispers, a thousand voices speaking in unison.

‚ÄúYou called.‚Äù

Jared‚Äôs knees buckled, and he fell backward onto the floor. ‚ÄúW-what? No, no, no. This‚Äîthis is a joke!‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù the demon said, its grin revealing a row of jagged, glistening teeth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve summoned me... for a jest?‚Äù

Jared‚Äôs lips moved, but no sound came out. He scrabbled for his phone, still recording. His fingers trembled so violently he dropped it.

The demon tilted its head, an almost human gesture of curiosity. ‚ÄúDo you know what happens to pranksters in my domain?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jared whimpered. He couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt look away from the thing‚Äôs face‚Äîor lack thereof.

‚ÄúThey become... the entertainment.‚Äù

The entity lunged forward with impossible speed, and suddenly Jared was no longer in his apartment. He stood on a barren expanse of cracked stone, the sky above churning with black and crimson clouds. Spectral figures writhed in agony around him, their screams piercing and unending.

‚ÄúNo! This isn‚Äôt real! This can‚Äôt be real!‚Äù Jared screamed.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs quite real,‚Äù the demon said, materializing at his side. It handed him his phone. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need this. Record away. Immortality of a sort, no?‚Äù

Jared looked down. The screen displayed his face, twisted in a rictus of terror. The camera was live-streaming, and the viewer count ticked upward.

‚ÄúHave fun, Jared,‚Äù the demon said, its voice dripping with malice. ‚ÄúYour audience will love this.‚Äù

As the shadows closed in, Jared heard one final whisper.

My thoughts have changed several times since I've opened the container and let it ""oxidize"" between servings. 

This is not like any French vanilla I've had. Ever. It doesn't even taste like frozen custard you'd get in the midwest on a layover. This tastes like egg nog if you removed a large amount of the spices. The annatto coloring makes it darker than you'd see from a natural French vanilla which is often off white tinging on yellow due to the extra yolks. I'm not opposed to annatto, it's a natural colorant but it looks bizarre in this ice cream. It's like looking at Edy's/Dreyer's weak ass coffee but with specks of vanilla bean. This ice cream also leans heavily onto a vanilla cheesecream frosting because it's not sweet like American buttercream frosting but it also isn't tangy enough for a cheesecake base to have been used. It's vanilla, it's there, but you're left pondering on what it's supposed to be. A better way of explaining it would be like how some people criticize flavored sparkling waters like La Croix as having fruit walked past it and leaving the aroma to flavor the water. 

u/Waggmans made a thread on this ice cream a week ago and since then I've slowly demolished what I had left. If not because I didn't appreciate it much but needed to make room for two new flavors. Would I ever buy it again? Heck no. I think if I did, it would be for shakes or as an ice cream cake filler, but there are better options. 


I picked up a boysenberry cheesecake ice cream, took one taste of it and realized I'd dislike it. I know my brother will love it. I'll be dropping it off at his place this weekend. The other flavor I picked up was the Edy's/Dreyer's Churro. I'll need to pickup another churro ice cream later this weekend from a competing regional brand. 


Also wanted to pick up the orange cream sherbet from Dreyer's/Edy's but there was one left and a kind lady wanted to pick it up for her sister once I realized what she was looking for and tapper her on the shoulder to show it to her. Oh well. Next time. This is an old flavor I remember form the 1990s. I remember it being very tasty. 


I have to think back to that Babbish special and wonder what Andrew was thinking when he said the Edy's/Dreyer's French vanilla was  good in an interesting way. I guess a lot of us assumed it was very good but clearly misunderstood his words. Vanilla ice creams are often always unique according to my own personal tastes. No one vanilla tastes the same. 


If I had to give this a rating on a 1-10 scale, I'd rate it a solid 5.5-6. It's edible. It's not awful. It's difficult to wrap your brain around. I'm more glad I got this on sale for cheap rather than spending $5-6 for it. The closest comparison I'd give this to is Tillamook's regular vanilla. It's vanilla but it tastes like nothing. It's there but it isn't. 


Taste: 5.5-6/10  
Texture: 5/10  Some icy textures here and there

In a melty or softened state it reminds me a lot of vanilla soft serve shakes you'd get from In N Out. Says vanilla, very sweet and similar to something vanilla but it isn't a vanilla.",2,1732339259.0,icecream,0,1.0,False

Hi sorry for the long background. I grew up in an extremely religious and very controlling household. I‚Äôm the oldest of 4 kids and was homeschooled. To give you an idea, we weren‚Äôt allowed to consume to secular media/music/tv/movies, everything had to be Christian and PG. We even had an internet blocker called Covenant Eyes installed on our computers that limited basically every website. This lasted well into my teenage years. We were not allowed to have friends outside of our religion, we weren‚Äôt allowed to go out, we had to have trackers on our phones at all times and we never got a real teenage experience. Never even went to high school. 

When I was 21 in 2020 I got a college internship in another state and got my own apartment for the first time. However when COVID hit, I lost my job. I fought tooth and nail, finding odd jobs like uber eats, instacart and DoorDash to keep my apartment. I was so proud of myself and felt so accomplished. I worked upwards of 80hrs a week. 

Now I‚Äôm engaged to a great guy and eventually I‚Äôll have to move in with him. He owns a 2bd townhouse and has a roommate. The main bedroom is also his office since he works from home. I know that moving in with him is the smart thing to do financially and obviously because we‚Äôre going to get married, we‚Äôll need to live together. However I get so much anxiety whenever I think about moving in with him for the following reasons. 

- I feel like there‚Äôs nowhere for me. My fiance and his roommate already have a system, have everything in the house split and take up the whole driveway. Street parking is hard to find and every time I visit I have to find street parking. There‚Äôs also nowhere for me to work, since I also work remotely it‚Äôll be hard to have 2 desks in the bedroom so do I work in the kitchen? It just doesn‚Äôt seem like I have a place in the house. I also have a cat and don‚Äôt want to inconvenience anyone because the townhouse is so small there‚Äôs not much space to put the litter tray or anything, I‚Äôve looked. I just feel by me moving in I‚Äôm inconveniencing everyone and also won‚Äôt have any space to myself to retreat if I need a breather. 

- I‚Äôm scared of giving up my independence. I‚Äôve lived alone for 4 years after spending my entire life living under someone else‚Äôs roof. It was so hard to get away from and I feel like no one can control me if I‚Äôm independent. I know my fiance is a good person and has done everything he can to reassure me that he‚Äôs not like my parents. But it‚Äôs hard. I make 50k and he makes $130k. He can survive without me but I‚Äôm in a constant deficit because of the increasing cost of living. So even I couldn‚Äôt live alone anymore even if I wanted to. 

- I LOVE my apartment. It‚Äôs in the perfect walkable location. The baristas at the local coffee shop know my name, I can walk to my gym and I‚Äôve made so many connections in the neighborhood. Me and my neighbor exchange recipes all the time. I just love where I live so much and I love living in a walkable community. My fianc√© lives by the airport directly behind an elementary school play/exercise/PE area. They blast high energy kids music every day at 8:30am sharp and it lasts all day. (Imagine being jolted awake by the gummy bear song at 10x volume every day). And there‚Äôs nowhere to walk to, no cafes, no gyms, no grocery stores nothing. It‚Äôs completely car dependent. So much of my daily enjoyment comes from my walks. :( 

It hurts knowing I‚Äôm in such a bad financial place that I once again need to rely on someone else. I feel depressed and scared thinking about giving up everything I‚Äôve worked for, selling my furniture and moving into someone else‚Äôs home. I love my fianc√© and he‚Äôs an amazing person, I really do want to spend the rest of my life with him and I know my fears are irrational but I just can‚Äôt get my fight or flight response to agree. I just want to run away and cry every time I think about giving up my apartment that I fought so hard to keep. I feel like everything I did means nothing. It sounds silly I know.  

So for those of you who have had to give up your apartment, your furniture everything to move into your SO‚Äôs house. How did you do it? Any advice? I‚Äôve been struggling with these thoughts often and I don‚Äôt want to feel miserable after moving in with my fianc√© because of what I had to give up.

So I'm just wondering if there is any agreement on this. In your opinion, which is more important in bed? Is length better than girth, or does girth matter more than length? And why?

1gxruxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1gxruxs/the_legend_of_the_perfect_hire/,The Legend of the Perfect Hire,"
In the heart of downtown Techopolis, a startup named Optimax Solutions posted a job ad: Junior AI Data Scientist Level IX, Entry Level

- A PhD in Quantum Computer Science (preferably earned by age 14).

- 25+ years of experience in using NeoCodex Pro, a software released just three years ago.

- Fluency in 17 programming languages, including one that was still in beta.

- Proof of having solved world hunger, ideally with a GitHub repo to showcase the code.

- In person at their office in the middle of the Arctic tundra.

- No vacation days.

- $7 an hour, with opportunities for exposure instead of health insurance.

The CEO, Chadwick Hyperburn, posted on LinkedIn, ""We believe in aiming high. If you're not willing to bleed for innovation, you don't belong here.""

After weeks of no responses, just as the team was considering lowering their standards to merely ‚Äúsuperhuman,‚Äù an email appeared in their inbox from someone named Zara Quantum.

Zara's resume was otherworldly. She had 40 years of experience with NeoCodex Pro (yes, 40), having ‚Äúworked on the prototype during time-travel experiments.‚Äù She spoke not 17, but 73 programming languages, including one that hadn't been invented yet but that she had ‚Äúconceptually mastered.‚Äù Her education spanned 12 PhDs, all earned simultaneously before her 21st birthday. And, as her cover letter humbly noted, she had indeed solved world hunger‚Äîtwice, actually, but only included it in her ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù section. Oh, and she was willing to work for $3 an hour, ‚Äúbecause passion is priceless.‚Äù

When Zara walked into the interview room, the Optimax team felt an almost divine presence. Round one of interviews consisted of her solving a technical challenge the team designed specifically to be unsolvable. She finished it in 12 minutes, using only a crayon. By round six, she had not only aced every question but had also written an entirely new hiring framework for the company.

As Zara progressed through all 78 rounds of interviews, she astonished every department. HR praised her for creating a universal work culture manifesto mid-conversation. Marketing hailed her for pitching a viral campaign idea while waiting for her coffee. Even the janitorial staff revered her after she spontaneously redesigned the office cleaning schedule for maximum efficiency.

By the final round, Zara was seated before the entire company in their Arctic igloo headquarters. The CEO leaned forward. ‚ÄúZara,‚Äù he began, ‚ÄúWhy do you want to work for us?‚Äù

She smiled softly, her aura practically glowing. ‚ÄúBecause I believe in you,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand in your mission.‚Äù The entire room erupted in applause. Some cried. The janitor fainted. By the end of her sentence the company‚Äôs value had skyrocketed 3000%, they had solved three global crises, and Optimax Solutions was hailed as the ‚ÄúMost Innovative Company in History.‚Äù

The next day, Zara received an email from the company. ""After careful consideration and a thorough review of your application, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose experience more closely aligns with the needs of this role at this time.""

Proof:  120. Definitely watered to 120. But we are not gonna complain about 120. 

Mashbill: unknown. Canadian Rye. What we do know is this release is small batch with 1/3 barrels being finished in Barbados rum. 

Price: 110 or so. 

Nose: soft canadian rye. Lots of earthy demerara sugar. Caramel and vanilla. Raisins and prunes. Moist rum cake, tiramisu. That rum barrel really comes through giving the whiskey mellow character. Light spice and mint come through at the end. Chocolate milk tea? If you put too much of thay syrup from Rhode Island. Toasted hazelnuts and old school camel tobacco. 

Palate: creamy profile. Dark demerara sugar, molasses, vanilla, leather and tobacco. Can't get enough how mellow this 120 proofer is. Dried raisins and prunes, coffee with milk, cinnamon sticks and cloves. That rum influence is super strong here.

Finish: that's where rye shows up. Peppermint and pepper, dried figs and vanilla beans. Light honeysuckle. Rye spice on the tongue 

Conclusion: one of my 10/10 was old bones rye single barrel. Its was over 130 proof beast at 18 years and 10 months and it shook me. It was amazing from flavor to proof. This expression is also good. And I enjoy it. It is incredible but not perfect as it makes me happy but not crazy happy. This is great bottle that everyone should enjoy.

1gxrsim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1gxrsim/weird_historical_facts_about_the_dodgers/,Weird Historical Facts About the Dodgers,"I asked ChatGPT for weird historical facts about the Dodgers. Here is what it spit out‚Ä¶ Are all of these true?!

	1.	Dodgers on the Run: During their first year in Los Angeles (1958), the Dodgers played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which was designed for football, not baseball. The left field wall was so close (251 feet) that it caused a flood of home runs.

	2.	Goats and Curses: In 1951, Dodgers fans brought goats to a game at the Polo Grounds to mock the New York Giants and their ‚Äúcurse.‚Äù Unfortunately, the Giants had the last laugh with Bobby Thomson‚Äôs ‚ÄúShot Heard ‚ÄôRound the World‚Äù that eliminated the Dodgers.

	3.	The Brooklyn Robins: Before officially becoming the Dodgers, the team was called the Brooklyn Robins, named after their manager Wilbert Robinson. Fans referred to them by various nicknames, including the Bridegrooms and the Trolley Dodgers.

	4.	Breaking News in a Coffee Shop: The Dodgers‚Äô move to Los Angeles was first leaked when team owner Walter O‚ÄôMalley accidentally left confidential documents on the counter at a New York coffee shop.

	5.	A Donkey on the Diamond: In 1939, the Dodgers had a mascot named Dazzy the Donkey, named after pitcher Dazzy Vance. Dazzy appeared in promotions and even stood on the field during games.

	6.	The Half-Owner Disaster: In 1947, co-owner Branch Rickey sold his share of the Dodgers to Walter O‚ÄôMalley‚Äîwho later moved the team to L.A. But another co-owner, John L. Smith, didn‚Äôt want to sell. So O‚ÄôMalley traded Smith ownership of the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for full control of the Dodgers!

	7.	Color Barrier History: The Dodgers weren‚Äôt just the first to break MLB‚Äôs color barrier with Jackie Robinson in 1947‚Äîthey were also the first to hire a Black coach, Buck O‚ÄôNeil, and one of the first teams to scout extensively in the Dominican Republic.

	8.	Bees Swarm the Dodgers: In a 2009 game, a swarm of bees delayed play at Dodger Stadium for nearly an hour. The players and fans had to evacuate while a local beekeeper handled the situation.

	9.	Dodgers vs. Hollywood: Dodgers outfielder Willie Davis famously got a role in the movie A Man Called Dagger. But after flubbing a key defensive play in the 1966 World Series, critics quipped that he should stick to acting.

	10.	The Earthquake Game: During the 1989 World Series, the Dodgers were at home watching their rivals, the Oakland A‚Äôs and the San Francisco Giants, when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit mid-game. The Dodgers joked they caused the ‚Äúshake-up‚Äù by winning the previous year.",0,1732337487.0,Dodgers,1,0.43,False

1gxrr6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gxrr6p/sp_of_shattered_plates_and_broken_things/,[SP] Of Shattered Plates and Broken Things,"Growing up, Ida Expur never broke a plate. Or at least that‚Äôs what her *parents* thought.

Sometimes there was a loud crash, but it was always fine. She was just a bit clumsy, the noise being the fault of a misplaced elbow or a stray knee or even a hip. Just like the first time it happened, back when Ida was still young. When the sound of shattering rang through the house, her parents rushed into the kitchen, only to find a stack of perfect plates and Ida on the ground.

‚ÄúIs anything broken?‚Äù they asked. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

Ah. So the plate was the important bit. It was only okay if nothing was broken.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay,‚Äù she lied, hiding her hands behind her back. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs broken.‚Äù

And it wasn‚Äôt‚Äînot anymore. She‚Äôd dived for the plate as it fell, but the only thing she got for her effort was a pair of scored palms as the shards ripped past her hands. For a moment, it was just her and the broken porcelain and two faint lines of blood. It was a useless instinct to push the shards back together again, to try and fit them back together as if they might suddenly become whole again.

Useless, futile, pointless. The plate would still be broken at the end of it.

Except it *wasn‚Äôt.*

It was smooth and clean, like new.

Unbroken.

Her parents looked and looked, but they couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of shattered fragments. ‚ÄúThen what was that noise?‚Äù they wondered.

Ida awkwardly twisted her hands behind her back. She could feel the blood beginning to drip. After remembering her shirt was black, she grabbed a chunk of fabric. The blood wouldn‚Äôt show. ‚ÄúMy knee hit the cabinet. It was loud.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt make sense, but it was the only reasonable explanation left. So they took it, and put away the perfect plates, and that night Ida went into the bathroom and clumsily stuck three flesh-colored bandages across her palms.

_It‚Äôs okay,_ she told herself. _Everything will always be okay as long as I can fix it._

Her palms fixed themselves too, eventually. But the scars remained.

Fixing things like that secretly was easy enough. Broken glasses were fitted back together with nary a crack remaining, the rip in her sweater when she caught it on a loose nail knit itself together again, the planter shattered by the baseball of one of the neighborhood kids reconstituted and refilled with dirt. People got angry when things were broken. This power of hers was nice. She could smooth out the shattered edges of their relationships and everyone would be happy.

Everything would be okay because nothing was broken.

But sometimes something broke when other people were around, and them magically being whole again would be suspicious. So Ida made it her business to learn how to fix things normally, too. She learned how to superglue a classmate‚Äôs sculpture back together, how to patch a hole in a wall, how to unclog a sink. Cars, furnaces, ceiling fans, socks, computers, ceramics. Ida knew a little bit about them all. Everyone knew Ida. Ida fixed things.

A jack of all trades and a master of none.

The first time Ida _didn‚Äôt_ fix something was when she met _him._

Her car broke down in the grocery store parking lot. Simple enough to fix with a thread of consciousness. But it was midday on a weekend, and there were _eyes_ on her. Concerned shoppers who‚Äôd seen her pull off in a fluster and pop open the hood of her car. She held her nose. So easy to fix! But she didn‚Äôt have the right tools with her for more mundane fixing, and it wasn‚Äôt appropriate to use her special type of fixing in public.

A voice came from behind her. ‚ÄúNeed help, Miss?‚Äù Ida looked up at the approaching man. He grinned sheepishly. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs a mechanic, so he made sure I know a thing or two. Got the tools in my car.‚Äù

She let him fix her car.

That one favor turned into a brief friendship that quickly became dating.

He was like the same sort of person she was‚Äîsomeone who fixed things. In fact, he was even better than she was at fixing relationships. It didn‚Äôt matter how angry someone was; if they spent five minutes talking to him, they would leave with a smile, the sharp, angry edges smoothed away in his presence.

Ida thought she‚Äôd found a kindred spirit. That maybe with him around, everything would be okay even if she didn‚Äôt *everything*.

He‚Äôd invited her to a cafe, three years to the day they‚Äôd started dating. The same place they‚Äôd gone for their first date. Was he going to ask her? Spending the rest of their lives together‚Ä¶

She‚Äôd like that.

Ida put down the fork, letting it rest on the half-eaten chocolate cake she no longer felt like eating. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She hid her shaking fingers in her lap. ‚ÄúCould you repeat that please? I don‚Äôt think I heard what you just said.‚Äù

He smiled‚Äîso sweet, so gentle. ‚ÄúI think we should break up. I‚Äôve met someone else.‚Äù

Ice blossomed in her shoes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve met someone else,‚Äù she repeated blankly.

‚ÄúYes! I knew you‚Äôd be understanding! She‚Äôs a bartender at the place where my buddy held his bachelor‚Äôs party last week. I thought I‚Äôd be satisfied with just being friends, but she‚Äôs the sweetest, most selfless woman I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù The words embedded in her chest like thick, sharp barbs. Wasn‚Äôt that how he‚Äôd always introduced *her*? That smile spread across his face again, his gaze never leaving his coffee cup as if he could see his new love reflected in it‚Äôs inky depths. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt bear to deny my feelings anymore, but we‚Äôve had a good time, haven‚Äôt we? It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to cheat on you. So I wanted to end things clearly with you first.‚Äù

She wanted to laugh. Wanted to cry. Her nails dug into the scars on her palms. But the only words that came out of her mouth were an emotionless ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Glancing down at her favorite chocolate cake, she suddenly couldn‚Äôt bear to be here a second longer. She shot to her feet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be leaving first then.‚Äù

She turned decisively, ignoring the matter of the bill, the fact that of what they‚Äôd ordered, it was _her_ chocolate cake that was more expensive.

A sound, like shattering plates, echoed from somewhere inside her chest.

Everything would be okay as long as nothing was broken.

But what was broken? The cars on the road were running, the TV in the corner of the cafe was quietly covering the aftermath of a local super fight, the door opened smoothly. _He_ wasn‚Äôt broken‚Äîhe was glowing and whole, flush with the headiness of early love. It couldn‚Äôt be herself, either. She wasn‚Äôt sick, didn‚Äôt have a fever, wasn‚Äôt bleeding, but why did it hurt so much?

Nothing was broken, but nothing was okay.

She had to fix it.

Everything would be okay as long as she fixed it.

Her feet moved aimlessly, taking her somewhere, anywhere other than here. There was nothing to fix here. Time bled away and she ended up in the neighborhood that had been on TV at sunset. Shattered glass. Cracked concrete.

Ah. Things were broken here. She could fix them.

Everything would be okay as long as she fixed them.

She wandered here and there, feet going anywhere, letting that little strand of consciousness run rampant.

She sent it ranging across the destruction, sliding deep into buildings to mend damaged load-bearing columns. Interior windows fixed themselves. Stoneware unshattered.

But it still wasn‚Äôt okay. Something was broken.

Ida kept moving, moving until her feet hurt and her vision blurred and her thoughts numbed and the world grew darker and darker behind her.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

The numbness had spread, and she couldn‚Äôt feel the hurt anymore. Mechanically, she kept walking forward. Maybe‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

No, just because she couldn‚Äôt feel it anymore didn‚Äôt mean it hadn‚Äôt fixed itself.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù A force pulled on her arm and Ida stumbled out of her daze. It was a man. Just a normal man off the streets, jeans caked with the building dust that floated relentlessly through the air. Building dust, she realized, that had also caked _her_ clothing. The nice skirt and blouse she‚Äôd picked out yesterday when he invited her out, the make-up she‚Äôd carefully applied, wanting to look extra nice. Just in case he _was_ going to ask her to marry him today. But now, here she was, just as disheveled and dirty as the rest of her surroundings, heels aching, bleeding as her nice shoes cut into the back of her foot.

She wanted to laugh at her past self.

Bent over, the man huffed and gasped, trying to catch his breath. ‚ÄúDamn you‚Äôre fast. Sorry about that, just wanted to get your attention since it seemed like everything else wasn‚Äôt working. All that back there, that‚Äôs you, isnt‚Äô it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù

The man gestured tirely behind him. ‚ÄúEverywhere you pass is just a little more intact than it ought to be. Took a chance and approached you to see if it was the case, but while trying to get your attention, I caught sight of a window fitting itself back together. You‚Äôve got one _hell_ of a gift, considsering your path of anti-destruction is at _least_ a mile long. Folks around here‚Äôll be grateful. Less stuff will have to be outright demolished.‚Äù He straightened, breath finally slowing and evening out. The space between his eyebrows ridge. ‚ÄúHey, I didn‚Äôt notice before since I didn‚Äôt see your face, but are you okay? Oh _god_, you‚Äôre crying a lot, aren‚Äôt you? Are you hurt? Here, I think I have some tissues.‚Äù

Her vision blurred, the sobs that had frozen in her stomach thawing, bubbling out of her throat.

Nothing was broken, but everything was not okay.

After half an hour and a pack of tissues, the stranger walked her to a nearby bus stop, the last remaining tissues still clutched in her hand. He scratched his head awkwardly. ‚ÄúWell, take care of yourself, okay? And give it some thought. If you contact the number on the card I gave you, I bet they‚Äôd hire you in a heartbeat. Actually get paid for the thing you did for free this afternoon. And it‚Äôs not some shady company!‚Äù he hurried to explain. ‚ÄúYou can double check the information online. And don‚Äôt feel pressured either. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you think it over and decide it‚Äôs not for you. But‚Ä¶ yeah, just think it over.‚Äù

The bus came, and they went their separate ways.

Ida Expur broke a plate.

It had already been a few months, but the hurt still didn‚Äôt heal and dazes were common. She stared at the flower of broken blue-and-white pottery blooming around her feet. Was it even worth it to fix? She had fixed so much recently, but no matter what she fixed, she still couldn‚Äôt fix a broken heart. But then her friend came from the other room and it was too late. The decision was made for her.

‚ÄúYou okay? Yes? Good. Here, wear my slippers so you don‚Äôt cut your feet up. I‚Äôll get the vaccuum, do you mind getting the broom from the closet since you‚Äôre closer? We‚Äôll have everything clean in a jiffy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you mad?‚Äù Ida couldn‚Äôt take her eyes off fragments, resisting the urge to send them back together and pretend it had never happened.

Her friend stopped in her tracks. ‚ÄúHuh? Why would I be mad?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs broken.‚Äù

A snort. ‚ÄúPlease. Do you have any idea how many plates and glasses I broke growing up? It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôve got spares.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù She finally tore away her gaze from the floor. ‚ÄúBut what happens when you break something not so replaceble, like a favorite figurine?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why superglue was invented.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it won‚Äôt be the same even after you glue it back together again,‚Äù she persisted. ‚ÄúYou can see the cracks, and will remember every time you see it that you once broke it. And what if superglue can‚Äôt fix it?‚Äù Superglue wouldn‚Äôt fix her broken heart.

Her friend shrugged. ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs broken. But that‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs sad, and you might grieve if you really liked it. It might be slow and there might be scars, but you‚Äôll pick yourself up and time will do the rest.‚Äù

Ida glanced down at her palms, at the two scars from her first broken plate. ‚ÄúWhat about hearts?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Her friend reappeared, lugging the vacuum behind her.

Ida shook her head. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Now get out of the kitchen so I can vacuum, okay?‚Äù

Moving out into the living room, Ida watched her friend cleaning up the broken bits, throwing them in the trash.

So it wasn‚Äôt that something was broken that made it not okay.

It was what happened because you cared.

And when you didn‚Äôt _want_ to fix it, when the broken thing wasn‚Äôt something good, you threw it in the trash.

She thought of the stack of photos of the two of them in her phone she couldn‚Äôt bear to delete, of sweatshirt he‚Äôd left at her place and forgotten about. Thought of the fact that even her current job was found through one of his connections.

She thought of the business card currently nestled in her wallet, an opportunity given by a stranger in a sea of destruction, earned through her own abilities.

Decisely, she opened her phone and started deleting photos.

Maybe what her broken heart needed wasn‚Äôt to fix everything. Maybe it needed to first throw away the destroyed remnants of her relationship before it could heal.

It's like groundhogs day. Can they mix it up just a little? Go vintage/antique shopping, make legit recipes, reorganize the house, etc..... just SOMETHING different i beg!

3rd..... are they for real not going to decorate the Christmas tree and just have a sad bare tree? Just at least get a bunch of kid friendly non breakable ornaments that smoke can at least have fun with then. Cloth ornaments, felt ornaments, so many options. So lame. I hope they decorate the tree and don't leave it bare like they did that year in Texas when they were getting ready to move to Nashville.

4th..... they have so much to catch up on but yes, go spend 7 hours at the hair salon even though you're too tired to even pack a suitcase lol priorities ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Unfinished business?","I started dating this girl, she's really cute and sweet and just great overall. I don't think she'd ever fuck me over or anything. Apparently, she has only been with 1 other guy, and he was just a FWB situation (weird I know) and they work together. I realize how that sounds and tbh I am still unsure if I actually trust her at all. We went out like 4 times and have been making out a lot and on the 4th date I fucked her. It was kind of sweet, she was really nice and made me a coffee before I left her house for work in the morning. She asked me if I wanted to be her boyfriend and I said yes.

Anyways, before we got together I had these little drunken flings with this girl who was a fucking mess but a great time. This girl is max level fun. She just recently got sober though and hit me up, so I invited her over to my place to make grilled cheeses and chat. We ended up fucking and it was a blast (this was literally 1 day before fucking the girl in the paragraph above). She is fucking awesome but idk if that is because she is just a wild good time or because I actually care for her.

I recently moved from an area close to sea level, to a relatively high altitude climate (\~6000ft). I admittedly have not visited a doctor in quite a while, but decided to visit a doctor in new location for a general checkup. The doctor notified me that my blood pressure was higher than normal (144/79). Doc instructed me to record my BP for 2 weeks and report back. I'm a week into tracking, and have consistently come in at 140+, with a handful in the 150s/160s, and once over 180. 

I'm getting concerned that this may be something other than the altitude change. Can anyone advise if this is normal and I just need to acclimate? Goes without said, I will follow my doctors instructions when I report back, but would love to hear if anyone has encountered anything similar before. Thank you in advance!

After 6 months of extensive use in various situations - from weekend camping trips to emergency backup during power outages - I feel I can provide a detailed, real-world perspective on this power station.

# Why I Chose the EB150 üåü

Like many of you, I found myself increasingly dependent on electronic devices even while trying to ""get away from it all."" The irony isn't lost on me - needing power to go off-grid! After my previous power station (a cheaper 500Wh unit) died during a crucial camping trip, I decided to invest in something more substantial. After weeks of research, I settled on the Bluetti EB150, and here's my journey with it.

**Personal Notes:** *That time during the unexpected storm when our campsite became the unofficial charging station for the entire campground really showed the true value of this unit. Not only did it keep our essential devices running, but it also helped create a sense of community during challenging conditions. These are the moments when you realize that good gear is worth every penny.*

Today I asked the man to grind for espresso.
But when I tried to pull and espresso shot my machine choked. Now I confirmed with the person that it was espresso grind.

I have four tickets (a reserved table) to give away for Gianmarco's sold out comedy show tonight (Saturday) @ 9:30pm at the DC Improv in DuPont.

Long story short is I got the tickets, and the next day something came up and I can't make it. My partner /u/thep0cketr0cket and I have tried everyone we know for months and no one we know can make it either and now we're out of time, so posting them here is a last resort. We did end up getting a second set of tickets and saw Gianmarco's opening Thursday show and laughed our address off.

How this is going to work is around 10am Saturday morning I'm going to pick whatever comment has the most upvotes and DM you. If I don't hear back in the first hour, I'll DM the next top comment and so on until someone responds. Then I'll edit this post and update any DMs for the non-respondents so they know not to worry about replying anymore.

The DC Improv website says all I have to do is call, identify myself, and then I can name someone else who can pick up the tickets so that's what I'll do. Looks like they open at 5:45pm on Saturday and I'll try calling earlier, but I suspect I might not get anyone until close to their open time. Doors are at 9pm, so there should be plenty of time to get ahold of them.

I know this sounds *super sketch* because you would have to share you name with me. I'm leaning on my own post history where you can see similar posts with me giving away tickets and older posts with me hosting meetups. And to build on that I'm sharing a redacted screenshot of the receipt, plus a photo of my partner and I with Gianmarco from Thursday's show. https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vxr4RBgigJ66goSw6

All I ask in return is you report back on how the show went! If you feel really guilty a bag of bougie coffee is always welcomed, but not expected.",6,1732335588.0,DCBitches,0,1.0,False

1gxr80s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gxr80s/how_to_heal_32_m_30_f/,How to heal? 32 M 30 F,"Me (32 male) and my ex girl (30) had a very deep connection. It was really deep for both of us. I‚Äôve loved and had heart break that I thought was bad but this one is different. 

Both ex drug addicts and she worked on her stuff more than I did. I used occasionally from her prescription that we both kind of enabled. 

I hadn‚Äôt received any real help besides for sobriety self born. She was in programs and stuff. 

I let my insecurities get the better for me often because of triggers from the past and I also was not there for her when she needed reassurance. Mostly because I became frustrated that I never seemed like I was enough to pleasure her. Like right after I gave her my soul in the bedroom she needed reassurance and it had boiled up and ended in a fight. 

She forgave me and hung out with me twice and was working on us. Then she said she needed space so I only responded when she snapped me. 

She messaged me late at night saying take pictures of the moon for me and being cryptic sending me my name spelled in bagels and stuff. She had mental health issues that I didn‚Äôt know how to help. So I said ‚Äòare you sure you don‚Äôt want me to come over?‚Äô And she flipped at me saying I wasn‚Äôt respecting her boundaries and it boiled down to essentially what it had been for awhile, me trying to define where we were at. So I went and knocked on her door because I was worried about her, she did not answer. 

Then she blocked me everywhere and her sister said not to talk to her and I later found out she ended up in the mental health unit. 

I waited about a month to send her an anniversary gift I had bought her with a letter in her box and her mom returned it (she told me to write her and I had already bought this gift and thought of it as a last chance and peace offering) 

Her mom said she was gonna put up cameras and I felt really attacked as I am not a criminal and felt really snubbed and left in the dark so I had some words with her. 

I sent her more messages to try and explain myself and then eventually stopped for a few months. 

I relapsed and wrote a lot of sad poems and posted music videos on TikTok and she kept unblocking me to watch them almost daily. She even liked one of the videos. 

So I can see when she blocks me and has me unblocked and it aches my heart because I love this girl and she loves me. 

After about 3 months I reached out and said cheekily that ‚Äòhey I know what you are doing and if you wanna meet up and have a coffee and chat then lemme know. Here is one last song for you‚Äô 

Made it all private and deleted my social media. 

She blocked me again. 

Keep in mind she was posting on Twitter about ‚Äòlosing her twin‚Äô and stuff obv relevant to me. 

So yeah where I‚Äôm at is I can‚Äôt choose anyone who doesn‚Äôt choose me. So I deleted the TikTok she stalks and apologized in the last message about the painful art when I left my number. 

I want her back. She is my world. I cried today. She is the light of my life. I guess I finally gave her the space she needs. 

How can I most effectively get this girl back into my arms without being manipulative. 

I have been healing, lots of self reflection, sober and going to NA meetings. 

Our love is deep. It feels really sad.

Any advice would be most welcomed. üôè

*edit* I don‚Äôt mean not pleasing her in the bedroom. It was more validation like she was worried I was cheating on her and didn‚Äôt love her or couldn‚Äôt accept all the love she gave. Less about the orgasm and more about the her needing a lot of reassurance which I tried my best to give.",2,1732335486.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1gxr7hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gxr7hb/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_give_back_a_comicbook/,AITAH for not wanting to give back a comicbook collection?,"So a friend of mine had this girlfriend, let's call her Lois. Lois became a welcome enough member of the group and something of a friend in her own rite, and she at the time had very recently left her husband. (Just for context my friend and I are late 20s, Lois is early 30s). She would bad mouth her ex CONSTANTLY, which got a little irritating as none of us even knew the guy, but whatever. 

One night I met them at a bar and she pulled me aside to talk to me. Apparently her ex had left his entire comicbook collection, two longboxes full, in the basement of her coffee shop and had been refusing to pick them up for months. She was ready to throw them out or donate them to goodwill, but knew I was a nerd and INSISTED I take them. 

Now I want to be clear, I was pretty uncomfortable with the idea. I didn't know this man and these were his valued collectibles. In fact, the reason she had told me in private was that my friend, her boyfriend, had been uncomfortable with the idea as well and told her not to ask me. But she wouldn't let it go, and after a whole night of her promising me they were going in the trash if I didn't take them, I relented and she dropped them off the next day. 

Months go by and eventually Lois and my buddy broke up. I wont go into detail, and obviously I only got his side, but it was apparent there were come pretty major emotional issues on her part and she ended up manipulating my buddy in some pretty uncool ways. 

Well, you guessed it. A week after they broke up she messages me and needs the comics back. Apparently now her ex won't sign divorce papers without them. Now I would happily give them back and just be done with it, but as anyone who has a significant comics collection can tell you...that shit is a pain in the ass to go through and organize. Not to mention this was six months ago she gave me the comics, I sorted them into my boxes ages ago, and have added lots of new issues on top of them by now. I honestly would have a pretty hard time even remembering what stuff was his at this point. 

I work a full time job, and try to have as much of a personal life around that as possible. I got errands and chores and life shit to deal with, and have very little spare time as it is. To give her back these comics would mean spending at least an entire day up-ending my entire living space to sort thru every single issue I own and separate what I THINK are the right ones. 

So here it is; I have no connection to this woman anymore, don't know her husband, have nothing to do with her divorce. The decision to leave the comics with her for months despite her threatening to get rid of them was his. The decision to insist that I take them was hers. If you remove me from the situation entirely the comics would be gone and he would have no way of getting them back.

Would I be an asshole if I told her 'not my problem' and kept the comics, even if it made her divorce even messier? Or am I obligated to spend the time and get them together for her?",4,1732335426.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
