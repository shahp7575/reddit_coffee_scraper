Hey everyone!  

I‚Äôm a 40-year-old looking to make new friends and build a sense of community in Peoria. I don‚Äôt drink, so I‚Äôm not really into the bar scene, but I‚Äôd love to find fun things that middle-aged folks do around here.  

A little about me: I‚Äôm not originally from the U.S., but I speak English fluently (though with an accent!). I enjoy good conversation, exploring new places, and connecting with people who have diverse interests. I‚Äôm open to anything‚Äîbook clubs, hiking, trivia nights, art or writing groups, live performances, or just casual meetups over coffee.  

Where do people go to meet others in Peoria? Any hidden gems or regular events that you‚Äôd recommend? Would love to hear your suggestions and maybe even meet some like-minded folks! Also, by like-minded people I mean liberal/centrist/ sane and can talk to immigrants without hating on them. ",1,1740434978.0,PeoriaIL,0,1.0,False

She is very hot, definitely one of most attractive women I have ever seen in my life, I approached her and I got her number. At first  I was really excited to go out with her but the outcome was disappointing, we only went on 3 dates because she takes 2-3 weeks between dates, she was quizzing me the whole time, she was asking alot of questions to the point where I felt like I was in a job interview not a date, and it seemed like she can't make up her mind on whether to be with me or not.

A week ago a girl at my gym asked me out, it wasn't the first time I seen her, I glance her at the gym often, anyways, I said yes to her and since then we train together daily and we hangout afterwards, I liked her, we are a match, we have common interests and good chemistry, so I decided to do the logical thing and call it off with Lucy, I would rather date a girl who is actually interested rather than chasing a girl who can't make up her mind, even if she is super attractive.

Yesterday I sent her a text saying I no longer wanted to see her and I wished her good luck, she immediately replied (she usually doesn't) asking why, so I was honest with her and I told her that I found someone else, she didn't take it well, she sent me an angry text saying that I wasted her time, called me a terrible person so I just sent her a short text saying ""if you were actually interested in me then you should've shown it"", she sent another long text but I just left it on seen.

1ixe97i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ixe97i/lelit_mara_x_usage_tips_and_review/,Lelit mara X - Usage tips and review.,"I hope this will be useful to people who are either looking at buying a Mara  X or own one already. There are lots of posts on the Mara, but it took me a while to find information that was helpful 
so I have compiled some tips I found useful plus one of my own I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else. 

Review:

The good:

It is still one of the best machines at its price point, despite being now a few years old. It can make good espresso and milk drinks.

It thermally stable for around two hours (more on this later). 

I have found the three temperature options enough for dark to light roast coffee. 

I like the way it looks. 

Reasonably fast heat up time at around 25 minutes

The bad:

The feet are flimsy and make it hard to empty the drip tray and make the machine level. I recommend replacing them. I bought mine from Etsy. It is possible to make your own feet or use furniture feet - the screw size is M5.

There is a valve above the drip tray that will leak under the drip tray when the machine is not level or when back flushing. This can be improved by replacing the feet. I also put a piece of kitchen towel under the drip tray. 

The V1 has high water usage - this can be improved by modding the machine. It is called the OPV mod.

It is temperature stable for around two hours after heat up, until you start making coffee. Once you make a coffee, you need to make all your coffee in a row. It remains stable for about four to six coffees before becoming too hot. When left after pulling a shot (or shots) the machine will continue to heat up. This will not suit everyone. 

Tips for usage: 

I bought a E61 grouphead thermometer and find it very useful. Understanding the heating cycle of the Mara is important to get the best from it. 

In coffee priority mode, when the lever is lifted the machine will boost the temperature of the boiler to make steam- when you then steam it reduces the boiler temperature. As mentioned above, this works well for back to back milk drinks however if you leave the machine for more than 5 minutes between shots it will overheat. 

If you wish to make back to back espresso - purging some steam will stop the machine overheating between shots. If you don‚Äôt purge steam it will overheat, the v2 has an espresso only mode I believe that does not boost the boiler.

To cool the Mara down I have found that turning it off and pulling some water from the hot water tap and then turning it back on will bring it back to temperature in about 5-10 minutes. It is possible to also turn the machine off and wait around 20 minutes.

The built in pre-infusion time is around 8-10 seconds. For a traditional 2:1 ratio with medium beans, if I get the first drop between 10-13 seconds then generally the shot will be good. Shots that have a total time of about 35-42 seconds are generally in the good range, although I have had success outside of this range too. 

The two tip steam wand is a bit fiddly to get used to, especially as there is a variable amount of steam pressure. I have had success with it in the middle with the holes pointing at roughly 3 o‚Äôclock and 9‚Äôoclock. I have made it work with the wand being off center with the tip being closer to the left hand side of the jug, with a slight tilt to the jug.

I don‚Äôt even like the taste of the cigarette anymore, its disgusting. I also have a mild form of asthma, which means at times i will have a hard time breathing while and after smoking. i have stopped previously for multiple periods, the longest I made it with no cigarettes and only an occasional vape was one month.. but I relapsed because I was bad mentally (still am but can‚Äôt afford therapy). I started going back to a dark place, overthinking and just feeling an unexplainable sense of doom and meaninglessness with everything I do. I was so dopamine deprived that I couldn‚Äôt get out of my bed and do anything productive for days. I avoided socialization with people because most of my friends smoke or hang out in caffe bars in which they smoke. In my country, smoking is so popular to the point that it‚Äôs allowed in closed spaces (caffe bars and clubs). I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do with my hands while i‚Äôm having a drink with someone, I‚Äôm already a really anxious person and I feel like I always have to somewhat perform or put on a show while I‚Äôm having a coffee with someone (I have to engage with them a lot so I don‚Äôt seem like a bitch). Everytime I stopped smoking and went out for a drink with someone I would just end up drinking my drink in the first 10 minutes because I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with my hands. Smoking is both ruining and helping my confidence - it is helping me with socializing but at the same time leaves me feeling with disgust, shame and weakness.

So for context, my friend has an issue with taking stuff without asking and over using what she takes. For example she would walk into one of our friend‚Äôs room and there will be an open bag of chips she will just reach her hand in there and eat all of it. Or she will come into another friends room say hi and just start making a coffee (she has a coffee bar in her room literally iconic). Keep in mind she never asks if she can use anything and when she was making the coffee it was literally everything like the coffee creamer, ice, a cup, and the syrups. So for the situation i need some advice on so my friend (18F) was having some issues with her skin so i was being a nice friend and let her use some of my The Ordinary skin care. Now if you don‚Äôt know The Ordinary is expense and this was a full bottle.

I tend to be way too nice to people who don‚Äôt do the same for me so I‚Äôm used to this but I‚Äôm just upset because I really wanted to see that movie. And I‚Äôve literally done so much for him but he‚Äôs never doing me any favors. 


They‚Äôre showing the movie again on Friday night so I‚Äôm planning on going with my partner but I‚Äôm still upset about all of this.

I‚Äôd slam through four or five books a week, over and over and over again. I loved to read, I loved to escape. I can't read anymore though. Ironically, I can still wright, but I can't read what I wrote. Five years ago, when I was sixteen, I had a really deep bout of depression, for roughly six months, give or take. The details are really fuzzy, to me at least. I hardly remember the time, it was like I fell asleep in August and woke up in May. It was the second year of lockdown for covid, and I missed my friends, my school so much. It was my only retreat I had, and I fell down the rabbit hole. I‚Äôm not sure if its then that it started, I actually think it started much earlier, a year prior. It was the beginning of my sophomore year, my mom had made me change schools against my will, separating me from my friends I had made only two years ago when she made me change schools again, and she had sent my little sister away to military school. I was new, and I was alone.

I started getting this feeling, this overwhelming sense of fatigue. No matter how long I slept, how early I went to bed, how early I woke up I was so *tired*. I started dozing off in class, I ended up having to copy my friends‚Äô homework to complete assignments I had no trouble doing prior, and I could barely make it through the school day. But that was towards the middle of the year, and lockdown had started soon after in March, and I thought it was over. ¬†Now I could sleep in all I wanted, complete the few and far between digital assignments with ease and sleep some more. Summer came and went, and online school started up again once more. I think by then I had lost it, I don‚Äôt remember starting the school year, or completing it in the spring, but I remember my floor.

My scratchy carpeted floors. I would lay there and sob, and nap, and sob, and nap, the coarse fibers made my face red and my legs and arms sore, but I couldn‚Äôt get up, not to make coffee, barely to eat, I just wanted to stay there and wallow in this unbearable sadness I couldn‚Äôt shake. My mother had put me in counseling, meeting once a week, I think on a Monday, with this random middle-aged woman I had never met before. She would suggest things like finding a new hobby, or exercise, but neither were available in the sort of environment my mother fostered. ¬†She ran the sort of household that made you second guess your every move, with her leaning over your shoulder telling you everything you‚Äôre doing is wrong or insufficient. I never learned to cook until I moved out, and I still can‚Äôt clean with anyone else in the room. ¬†When I couldn‚Äôt meet her suggestions, she finally gave up and said its my fault I‚Äôm not getting any better. We had stopped meeting weeks prior to that conversation because my mom got tired of driving me, when I didn‚Äôt proceed to get better, aka my grades didn‚Äôt improve. My mother called the counselor, in which she promptly told me it‚Äôs all my fault as a sixteen year old girl, that I cant get better.

Later that year I turned seventeen, and I of course realized that I only had one year to go. I started texting my older sister who lived in a different state, a plan to move out when I turned eighteen. My sister in turn, couldn‚Äôt keep her mouth shut which sent her into a spiral, she called me ungrateful, and evil and that I was breaking her heart and the next thing I knew she had bought me a plane ticket. That May I was leaving. I had never been on a plane before. I was terrified and alone. I remember sitting there at take off, tears seeping into my mask. Luckily a nice woman and her baby sat next to me and kept me busy with chatter. When I landed, my sister greeted me, and she took me to live with my father. She had decorated the spare bedroom in his house all cute with matching furniture and paint, a desk to do my homework and bed with brand-new covers. It was nice for the few months it was mine alone, and then before the next school year would start, my mother sent my little sister away too for bad grades.¬† So then the two of us shared the room, for the rest of our high school careers. I am thankful that I was able to spend those years, however traumatizing with my father and sister in that house, because only four years later, he would pass away this January of liver disease.

It wasn‚Äôt necessarily a shock, we had known this would be coming for awhile, if you see my post on r/GriefSupport  I go into his medical history a little bit, but it was a blow. He was my last reliable person gone. I can feel the depression taking over again, the never ending fatigue, the urge to just lay on the floor and never get up, I'm in college now and I cant do my assignments because I cant read, I mean I can read but I cant *read*. The concentration, the focus its just gone, and¬† I need to complete these classes to fulfill my scholarship but I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me. It‚Äôs hard because everyone's like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre so smart you just need to *apply* yourself,‚Äù As if its that simple. I‚Äôm also a little frustrated at my mom because I‚Äôve shown severe symptoms of Anxiety, Depression and OCD at a very young age, (around five) and she never sought help or diagnosis because I did well in school, while my other three sisters who struggled in school all got diagnosed and medicated.¬† I‚Äôm seeking counseling now in hopeful reference to a psychiatrist to diagnose me, but I‚Äôm hoping that others out there can feel seen in my post.",1,1740433963.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I have been tracking ovulation with the pregmate strip tests. I have not yet started tracking BBT but am thinking of it in the future as it would help me actually confirm ovulation. 

My period was supposed to start 4 days ago (2/21). 
I had one test I think was a faint line on an FRER 2/22 (line eyes !!!), and have been testing negative ever since. 
Realistically, what are the chances I am pregnant this cycle? I had a peak ovulation test on 2/7. So I am 16 DPO if I successfully ovulated. I see on so many posts people testing positive 10-12 even 14 DPO but never 16. I guess I‚Äôm just feeling discouraged and looking for advice on if I‚Äôm driving myself crazy or if I have the right to be hopeful :( 

I have been having headaches, smell and my favorite coffee aversions, nausea and vomiting, very emotional, lower back pain, tender and very sensitive nipples but not breasts. I had really bad cramps on 2/17 which I thought could be either implantation or start of my period but I don‚Äôt know now.

Mira looked at the shrunken husk that had once been her father. He lay in a hospital bed under layers of heavy blankets, slowly forgetting how to breathe. He let out a gasp. His frail ribcage heaved with rapid, shallow breaths. Then, for a long moment, there were no breaths at all, until another rattling gasp and heave escaped his chest. The chill autumn wind seemed to breathe with him through the cracks in the windowsill.

Next to the bed, Mira fidgeted on the hard wooden stool. The small bedroom was hot and stuffy; her pink sweater and gray slacks were damp with sweat. Her stomach churned at the thought that the smell of death would linger on her clothes, following her wherever she went. Her sparse lunch tried to lodge itself in her throat. Mira swallowed it back down.

She frowned at her younger sister Grace, who stood behind their father's balding head. At twenty-nine, Grace still looked like a teenager. Her blue hair, red t-shirt, purple pants, and black combat boots were more suitable for a punk show at a dive bar than for a deathbed vigil.

Their father's eyes opened wide. He scanned the room as if searching for something no one else could see. An old silver scar gleamed on the pale skin under his left eye. His mouth moved but no sound came out. Their father raised a trembling hand.

Grasping his cold hand, Mira pressed the back of it to her hot cheek. She leaned close to her father's face and said, ‚ÄúIt's ok, Dad. You can let go now. I love you.‚Äù She looked at her sister. ‚ÄúGrace, tell him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCerebral net status,‚Äù Grace said out loud to her neural link. Her eyes scanned the data received by her retinal link. She then glanced at the array of microscanners and sensors hovering like a halo over her father's head. At a thought from Grace, her neural link sent a list of minor modifications to the halo. The faint blue glow turned red while it made the adjustments.

‚ÄúFor God's sake! Tell Dad he can go!‚Äù Mira said.

Grace raised her eyebrows and glanced down at her father with piercing blue eyes that matched his and Mira‚Äôs. ‚ÄúStop holding on. It's your time, old man.‚Äù She turned to Mira. ‚ÄúHow was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrace‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Their father gasped one more time and then, nothing.

Mira and Grace held their breath.

The hospice nurse stepped forward and placed his gloved fingers on their father's neck. Then he put his stethoscope on their father‚Äôs chest. The silence seemed to last forever.

‚ÄúHe's gone,‚Äù he said.

Mira placed her father's limp hand on the bed. Tears pooled in her eyes. She covered her mouth to stifle a sob.

Grace said, ‚ÄúDownload stats.‚Äù She scanned the readout. The corners of her mouth lifted. ‚ÄúMira, I got them. It worked.‚Äù

Mira shook her head. ‚ÄúWhat? How much‚Äî‚Äù

Grace grinned. ‚ÄúEverything from the last thirty-five years!‚Äù

\#

Mira followed Grace into her office at Cerebri Corp. She stared at the spacious room and floor-to-ceiling windows as the soundproof door slid shut behind her. While Grace was on track to become CEO, Mira was one of Cerebri Corp's many faceless, voiceless accountants, destined to be forever hidden in a tiny basement cubicle.

She sat across from Grace and tried to ignore the chair as it automatically adjusted to her height and posture. Mira frowned at the walls instead; they shone a dull gray with muddy brown streaks. The luminescent coating was programmed to shimmer with a rainbow of colors that changed with the time of day, the emotions of the viewer, and myriad other factors. It was something Grace had developed when she was an undergrad.¬†*I bet she never sees any ugly colors*, she thought.

‚ÄúI skimmed the files to get an idea of what the cerebral net was able to download,‚Äù Grace said. Her eyes were bright, her skin radiant.

Mira stifled a sigh. Her eyes looked bruised and abused from two days spent crying and barely sleeping. The wall color shifted; red streaks infiltrated the brown. Her face felt hot. She took deep breaths until the red faded away. ‚ÄúHe didn't want this. He didn't want us digging through his private li‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything was fucking private! I doubt even Mom knew him. That‚Äôs probably why she left.‚Äù Grace turned to her console. ‚ÄúHow do you love someone you don't know?‚Äù

‚ÄúI loved him,‚Äù Mira said.

‚ÄúYou loved an idea of him.‚Äù

Mira grimaced. ‚ÄúI knew him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's gone. I want you to leave him alone.‚Äù Mira choked back a sob.

Grace stiffened. ‚ÄúDad was always alone. Both he and that house were so fucking cold. Especially after Evan died.‚Äù She drew in a long breath before whispering, ‚ÄúI have to know if he ever loved me.‚Äù

Mira felt her scratchy eyes fill with tears. ‚ÄúOh, Grace‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he didn't, I won't feel bad I didn't cry for the bastard.‚Äù Grace spun around to face Mira. ‚ÄúAt his age, his childhood memories were too degraded to download, so we'll have to start in his early twenties when he was a scout in the war. That would‚Äôve been just before The Desolation.‚Äù

Mira shuddered. She remembered her high school history teacher describing The Great Desolation as if she were reading the day's weather report. ‚ÄúAt the end of the war, a doomsday device was detonated in Beratonia. When their shield dome unexpectedly vanished, our troops searched the entire country and found no one, living or dead. All signs of civilization had vanished without a trace. It's unknown to this day who did it or why.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't want to see that,‚Äù Mira said.

Grace continued, ‚ÄúI scanned for any specific events that could have been traumatic for him. We‚Äôll start with those. Unfortunately, the Memento Vita project is still in the early stages. It can show us what Dad saw and heard, but not what he felt or thought.‚Äù She handed Mira a pair of wrap-around, thin-lensed glasses. ‚ÄúYou really should get retinal and neural links, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even want the aural‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThe glasses will act like a retinal link and auto-connect with your aural link. It might feel overwhelming. Just relax and remember, it‚Äôs not real. We're only along for the ride.‚Äù

*Patronizing as always*, Mira thought. She watched Grace recline in her chair and shut her eyes. Mira fumbled around for a button or lever; she let out a small yelp when the chair reclined on its own. Her aural link emitted a hum when she slid the glasses on. The lenses turned opaque.

At first, there was darkness and silence. And then...

Bright sunlight streamed through the bare trees. The wind whispered through the branches. Small tufts of scraggly brown grass dotted the dry forest floor.

The scout touched his watch. A holo of a compass and map with a blinking dot appeared above the screen. He dismissed it and walked until he came to a deep hollow. He slid down into it, sat on the ground with his back to a rotting log, and set down his pack. He pulled a tiny, military-issue pill box out of his pocket. The lid was labeled 'caffeine' in red letters. He popped a tablet into his mouth. After drinking some water from his canteen, the man leaned back and closed his eyes for several moments.

When he opened them, the pack was gone. He jumped up and peered out of the hollow. A soldier in enemy uniform sprinted away, clutching his pack.

The scout chased after him.

The enemy ran toward a pile of boulders that stood near an energy shield.

The scout lost sight of him. He pulled a small pistol from its holster and slowly advanced toward the boulders. Circling them, he found nothing. The soldier was gone.

‚ÄúFucking hell,‚Äù he whispered. He walked to the edge of the energy shield. The shimmering gray wall rose out of sight. The surface rippled like water when the wind touched it. Partially liquified remains of squirrels and birds littered the bare ground nearby. There were no openings in sight.

The scout moved away from the shield and squatted on the other side of the rocks. Popping another caffeine tablet, he stared at the yellow lichen that grew in circular patches over the craggy granite. One of the boulders winked out of existence for a second, as if he had blinked. Then the boulder flickered and reappeared.

The man moved closer. The stone quivered and vanished, revealing a tunnel. He tapped the light on his left shoulder. A red circle illuminated the tunnel entrance. He stuck his head inside. It was silent. Pistol in hand, he crawled inside on his hands and knees. He followed the tunnel as it sloped down and then up again. It ended at another boulder. When he touched it with the barrel of his gun, the rock vanished.

He peered out into a dim, gray world. His breath misted in the air. The dome of the energy shield hovered high overhead like a permanent cloud cover. Scattered nearby were dead trees and animal bones. The crumbling remains of a small village peeked through patchy fog.

Twenty feet ahead, the enemy soldier crouched. His back was to the scout. There were no other soldiers in sight.

Creeping closer, the scout raised his aphonic pistol and fired.

The soldier stiffened and collapsed. Red blood seeped from the hole in his chest into the mud.

The scout turned the body over with his foot. The soldier was a boy, no more than thirteen years old. The dirty, threadbare uniform of a much larger man dwarfed his emaciated body. Clutched in his hand was a meal bar.

A whimper came from behind the scout. He turned.

Another young, thin boy stepped out of the bushes. As he walked toward the scout with filthy hands outstretched, blood bloomed from a hole in his throat.

Bullets whizzed past. The scout dove behind a boulder. The top of the rock exploded. A granite shard hit his left cheek.

Soldiers swarmed over the scout. They took his gun and knocked him to the ground. Someone kicked him in the ribs.

The scout curled up.

Laughter rang out. The soldiers rolled the scout onto his back and searched his pockets.

The scout stared at the energy shield above. Red streaks had diffused into the shimmering gray as if a painter had dipped a brush filled with vermillion pigment into murky water. The red seeped out of the sky, coloring the edges of his vision.

One soldier said, ‚ÄúVoster anta restret?‚Äù

The scout was silent.

‚ÄúVoster anta restret?‚Äù

‚ÄúRot in hell, bastards.‚Äù

Another soldier pulled out a knife. He dug the tip into the scout's shoulder, pushing harder and harder.

The world turned crimson. It glowed brighter and brighter.

The scout screamed. Blinding white light filled his vision.

Everything went black.

The scout cracked open his eyes. Sunlight shone into them. He blinked and sat up with a groan. The fog had cleared.

The soldiers were gone. So was the dome.

The scout pulled himself to his knees and rose to his feet. Shading his eyes, he scanned the horizon. The village was gone. There was nothing but brown mud dotted with puddles of red.

Mira ripped off her glasses. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Grace sat up and opened her eyes. ‚ÄúThe Bleeding Fields. Dad must have been there when the doomsday device went off.‚Äù She rubbed her face. ‚ÄúBut how the fuck did he survive when nothing else did?‚Äù

Staring at the carpet, Mira felt her breakfast creep its way up her throat. She swallowed it back down. ‚ÄúI don't want to see anymore. That's obviously what made him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMom said he'd been tortured as a POW. That they'd cut out his tongue. We haven't seen that yet. We need to keep going.‚Äù Grace closed her eyes and leaned back.

Mira reached into her pocket and clutched a crumpled paper before she put on her glasses and followed Grace back in.

The scout tore off his sleeve and struggled to bandage his shoulder one-handed. He walked past the place where the village had been. The sun left its zenith and began its slow descent. A landscape of muck and red polka-dots remained unchanged until the scout came to a series of crimson ponds. He spun around and searched the horizon. A crow circling overhead was the only thing that moved.

He checked his map. The dot placed him in the center of a large city. He scanned the attached intelligence file. It noted a pre-war population of three million.

Red tinted the sky. The man sat on a rock and rubbed his face. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a small signal mirror, and held it up. His jaw glowed, turning the spatters of dirt and blood into black specks.

Footsteps squelched in the mud. The scout turned his head.

Soldiers wearing the same uniform as his surrounded him with aphonic pistols raised. Each man was tinged with red.

‚ÄúGre nata deta! Raise your hands!‚Äù

The scout glanced back at the mirror. His jaw blazed scarlet. He opened his mouth. White light poured out. He turned to the soldiers and yelled, ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù

There was a bright flash and then darkness. When the scout opened his eyes, the soldiers were gone.

With trembling hands, the scout held up the mirror again. His face looked normal. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù he whispered. He took a knife from his belt. He raised it to his throat. After several moments, he lowered it. Tears blurred his vision.

The man fell to his knees in the mud and jammed the mirror into a crack in the rock. ‚ÄúWhy is this happening?‚Äù he screamed at his reflection.

The fringes of his vision filled with red. He opened his mouth. His tongue shined dazzling white. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. The mirror disappeared in a puff of dust.

In one quick movement, the scout lifted his knife and swung it in front of his face. Blood splattered the rock. He watched his tongue splash into the red muck, its brilliant glow fading away.

Everything went black.

Mira and Grace sat up. They were silent for several minutes, each lost in her own thoughts.

Mira rolled her tongue around in her mouth to confirm it was still there; it throbbed where she must have bitten it. ‚ÄúWe've seen enough. We have to stop!‚Äù

Grace shook her head. ‚ÄúThere's another memory I need to see.‚Äù She picked up her coffee mug. Her hand trembled.

‚ÄúGrace, please. I can't‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen don't!‚Äù Grace slammed her mug on the desk. Cold coffee splashed onto her hand.

Mira flinched and said, ‚ÄúWhat memory?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe day Evan died.‚Äù

Mira blanched. Evan had been home sick that day, so Mom had taken the girls to school on her way to work. Dad was supposed to be home watching him. In the police statement, Dad had noted that he had run to the pharmacy around the corner to get medicine while Evan was sleeping. When he returned, Evan was dead. The police had ruled it an accidental death.

Grace leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes.

Taking deep breaths, Mira leaned back.

Evan lay in his bed with his eyes closed. His breaths were shallow and fast. His chubby cheeks were flushed red.

His father touched the watch on Evan's wrist. On the strap, the cartoon dog and boy wearing a white bear hat danced. The screen flashed a temperature of 102.5¬∞ F. The man walked to the adjoining bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet. A full bottle of children's cold medicine sat on the top shelf. He poured the orange goop into the small measuring cup and took it to the bedroom. He nudged Evan awake.

Evan opened his eyes. He groaned, trying to roll over.

His father helped the boy sit up and gestured that he take the medicine.

‚ÄúEwww, don‚Äôt want it,‚Äù Evan murmured.

The man sighed. He held the back of Evan‚Äôs head and pushed the cup to his lips.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Evan knocked it out of his hand. The cup hit the wall, splattering orange goop. The boy struggled against his father. His flushed face darkened. A faint light shone from between his clenched teeth.

His father jumped off the bed and stumbled back into the wall.

Evan whimpered. The light in his mouth grew brighter until his jaw glowed.

The man turned and ran down the hall to the storage closet. He dug in the drawers for a large pair of sewing shears. He grabbed them and dashed back to Evan's room. Before entering, he hid the shears behind his back.

Tears streamed down Evan's cheeks. His lips trembled.

His father brought his index finger to his lips and shook his head as he sat on the edge of the bed. The man grasped Evan's chin and pointed his mouth away from his face. He pulled the boy's mouth open with one hand. The other raised the shears.

Evan's eyes opened wide. His tongue moved as if he was about to speak.

His father flinched and ducked.

The boy wriggled out of his father's grasp, leaped out of bed, and ran into the hall.

His father chased Evan down the stairs.

Evan flew toward the back of the house. He dashed out the door and into the yard in his bare feet.

The man ran outside, scissors still clutched in his hand.

Wet brown maple leaves coated the yard and surface of the in-ground pool.

Evan sprinted alongside the water. He slid on a patch of leaves, pitched backward, and slammed his head against the concrete patio.

The man stopped. He stared at Evan.

Evan lay still.

He walked to the boy's side and knelt.

Evan‚Äôs eyes stared at the sky, unblinking. His breaths came in irregular gasps interspersed with long moments of nothing as if he couldn‚Äôt remember how to breathe. The boy's mouth lolled open. The glow of his tongue dimmed to an ember.

His father closed Evan's mouth. He brushed the boy‚Äôs bangs out of his eyes and caressed his cheek. He pushed the boy closer to the edge of the pool.

Then his father rolled Evan into the deep end.

Rippling waves sent a flurry of dead leaves sinking to the bottom.

The man stood and went into the house without a second glance. He put the shears away. He scrubbed the bedroom wall clean of orange goo and poured the remaining medicine down the drain.

The man went downstairs, put on his shoes and coat, and walked out the front door.

Mira pulled off her glasses. Her chest felt tight. She clenched her jaw to hold back a scream.

Grace sat up, her face blank.

Neither woman moved or spoke for a long time.

Mira finally said, ‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù

Grace blinked and shook her head. ‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad killed Evan.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think Dad killed a lot more people than our little brother,‚Äù Grace said. She spoke to her console. ‚ÄúWhat was the population of Beratonia before the Desolation?‚Äù

A pleasant disembodied voice responded, ‚ÄúOne-hundred and fifty-three million people.‚Äù

The glasses slipped from Mira's fingers. ‚ÄúYou think Dad did that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe saw it. He was the only one who survived.‚Äù

Mira slid her hand into her pocket. She clutched the paper. ‚ÄúNo, he wouldn't‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt looked like Evan could do it, too, whatever it was.‚Äù Grace smirked. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out for Dad. An accidental drowning is easier to explain than cutting out your kid's tongue.‚Äù

Mira glared at Grace. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you approve of what he did.‚Äù

Grace shrugged. ‚ÄúDo you still love him after what you've seen?‚Äù

‚ÄúI... I don't know. He was a monster.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did what he had to do,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúHe was supposed to protect his child, not kill him.‚Äù Mira‚Äôs tongue throbbed in time with the headache that pulsed behind her eyes. ‚ÄúShould we tell someone about Beratonia? The government or something?‚Äù

Grace snorted. ‚ÄúChrist, Mira. Think! We'd get hauled off to some secret lab and tested like guinea pigs. Do you want that?‚Äù She pointed to the dime-sized data crystal sitting on the transceiver pad of her console. ‚ÄúThankfully, I only stored Dad‚Äôs memories locally. No one else at the company has access.‚Äù

The walls swirled a sickly yellow-green. Mira's stomach heaved. She slipped to her knees, grabbed the trash can, and vomited up her breakfast.

Grace's eyes softened. She handed Mira a bottle of water. ‚ÄúYou ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, I'm not ok.‚Äù Mira's stomach heaved again. She reached into her pocket for a tissue. A piece of paper fell out.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù Grace asked.

‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù Mira reached for it.

Grace lunged and snatched up the paper. ‚ÄúThis is Dad's handwriting. Where did you get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was in the safe with his will. It didn't make sense until now.‚Äù

Grace read it out loud.

‚ÄúTo Mira and Grace, I caused The Desolation. I spent years searching for the reason I was cursed with this terrible power. When I didn't find one, I wanted to die. Then you girls and Evan were born, and you gave me a reason to live. But I passed my curse on to Evan, and maybe to you, too. I should have killed all of us when I realized. I was a coward. Do what needs to be done. Kill yourselves before it‚Äôs too late.

‚ÄúLet this evil end with us.‚Äù

The letter slid from Grace's fingers onto the floor. ‚ÄúHe passed it on to us...‚Äù She pulled a bottle of vodka out of a desk drawer, poured some into her cup, and took a gulp. The mix of leftover coffee and vodka made her grimace. ‚ÄúI guess all of this explains why he chose sign language over a neural link and voice generator.‚Äù

Mira shoved the paper back into her pocket. ‚ÄúSo what do we do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet drunk for starters. The fuck if I know after that.‚Äù Grace picked up what looked like a silver pen off the workbench next to her desk. ‚ÄúWe could use this laser cutter to remove our tongues. Or slit our throats.‚Äù

Holding up the bottle, Grace said, ‚ÄúDrink up, my dear, cursed sister. It could've been worse. At least we don't have children.‚Äù

Mira's lips quivered. Her hand went to her stomach.

Grace's eyes widened. ‚ÄúOh, my God. Tell me it's not true!‚Äù

Mira wrapped her arms around her abdomen and didn't respond.

Grace began to laugh hysterically. When she got herself under control again, she wiped her eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou always make the worst fucking life choices. I don't understand how we're related.‚Äù She took a swig of vodka straight from the bottle. ‚ÄúYou know you have to get rid of it.‚Äù

Mira glared at the walls. Red threaded into the murky yellow-green.

‚ÄúMira, did you hear me? You can't have this baby. It's too dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt kill my child.‚Äù

Grace slammed the bottle on the desk. ‚ÄúDad wiped out an entire country by accident. What happens if your child has a temper tantrum? They might destroy the whole world!‚Äù

The walls turned a deep crimson that pulsed in time with the pain in Mira's head and tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like Dad!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre not like Dad! He did what he had to do.‚Äù

Crimson seeped into the edges of Mira's vision. ‚ÄúI'll go somewhere far away. You'll never see me again. If you destroy the memory files‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, Grace. I've never asked you for anything. Just let me‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don't have an abortion, I'll send the files to the news outlets,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúYou can't! They'll figure out who Dad is. They'll take my baby and you and I will end up prisoners in some secret lab like you said.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat thing will cause another Desolation,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúThat thing is your nephew or niece,‚Äù Mira said quietly.

‚ÄúWho could kill every creature on Earth!‚Äù

Mira stood and said, ‚ÄúI won't let that happen. Erase the files.‚Äù

Grace smiled. It failed to reach her eyes. ‚ÄúI'll erase the files once you‚Äôve erased that abomination.‚Äù

Mira blinked. The whole world was painted red. Her tongue burned like she was sucking on a hot coal.

‚ÄúMira, your face!‚Äù Grace jumped up and backed away. ‚ÄúDon't say anything!‚Äù

Mira slapped both hands over her mouth. Her body trembled.

‚ÄúShit! Shit! Shit! Try to stay calm, ok?‚Äù Grace grabbed the laser cutter. ‚ÄúI can remove your tongue with this. It‚Äôll cauterize the wound so you don't bleed out.‚Äù

Mira‚Äôs eyes widened. She shook her head and stepped back.

Grace took a step toward her. She spoke in a quiet, soothing voice. ‚ÄúWe have to, Mira.‚Äù

Mira moved one hand from her mouth to her stomach.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll worry about that later. Right now, let's do what we have to do.‚Äù Grace took another step toward Mira. And another.

Mira ducked her head and shook it harder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid! It‚Äôs not like you ever had anything to say anyway!‚Äù Grace snapped.

Mira's head jerked up.

The sisters glared at one another.

Finally, Mira nodded. She stopped trembling as her hand fell away from her mouth.

Grace lifted the laser. ‚ÄúThis will hurt. I'm sorry.‚Äù

Mira caressed Grace‚Äôs cheek. Then she took a big step back and closed her eyes. ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù she whispered.

There was a blinding flash. When Mira opened her eyes, Grace was gone. A pool of blood seeped into the green carpet, turning it a muddy brown.

She wiped the tears from her face with the heels of her hands. She kept her breathing slow and even until the pain in her mouth faded away. ‚ÄúI had plenty to say. You just never listened,‚Äù Mira whispered.

She went to Grace‚Äôs desk and grabbed the data crystal. She dropped it on the floor and ground the heel of her shoe into it. Once she was certain it was pulverized, she threw back her head and yelled, ‚ÄúTHIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO!‚Äù

Mira felt a tiny flutter in her stomach. She placed a hand over it. The shimmering walls glowed the golden yellow of a sun-dappled afternoon as she walked out of the office without looking back.",1,1740433876.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

1ixe2b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MailOrderBrideFacts/comments/1ixe2b7/findmate_appreciation_post_and_review/,Findmate appreciation post and review,"TLDR to have a good time on Findmate do these three things:

1 Know how to talk to women. It will make the next two easier
2 Set a dollar amount you‚Äôre willing to spend in order to ‚Äúget her number‚Äù
3 Move off of Findmate ASAP

I‚Äôll address the common criticisms I‚Äôve seen on this sub and in reviews as I go along. 

I, a Midwest 7.5 just returned from a three day trip to Moldova to visit absolute 11 that I met on Findmate three weeks prior. We already have plans on the books to meet in Italy for two weeks in the spring.

Background: I had planned on sending a handful of letters to women in Russia through AFA. Started studying Russian 25 hours per week. I had flights and hotels booked for the entire month of April. The visa application was in the works, and I had just yet to send the letters, per the recommendation off LoveScout, not reach out until travel plans were set. Then I saw this post.!!!!!!!!!!
And thought perhaps I‚Äôd get lucky and find some of these women on Findmate.

They weren‚Äôt there, but I met many others and found myself spending all of my time talking to one absolute goddess in particular. That‚Äôs point one. The ‚Äúmen pay to play‚Äù aspect of the site brought far more attention from far better looking women than I would see on domestic dating sites or in the real world. They may initially reach out for the nickel they earn from every comment you send, but if you can talk to them, you can factor that out pretty easily. But you‚Äôll start with options unlike you‚Äôve ever seen on Tinder. 

Another criticism is scamming, or not knowing who you‚Äôre talking to. Well, don‚Äôt trust the built in verification on the site. How did I know she was real? Ask her to send a picture of her holding a coffee mug, or anything. It costs them nothing to send a photo and if they‚Äôre not willing to do that, move on. I don‚Äôt know why men are suspicious about this factor. It‚Äôs an easy fix.

I hear criticisms about the fact that we have to pay. So do as little of that as possible. Set a budget, mine was five dollars. Are you willing to buy woman a drink to start a conversation? Then send 50 messages. If after that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any chemistry, move on. It shouldn‚Äôt take that long in most cases. But when I‚Äôd find a woman I was building good rapport with, I‚Äôd ask them to move the conversation to WhatsApp or telegram. And if the answer was no, it probably isn‚Äôt worth continuing the conversation. Either way telegram is a far better platform for communicating and I don‚Äôt know that I would‚Äôve gotten the invite to Moldova without it.

Findmate is great, if used wisely. Throw some money at it, and if you find a keeper, the company will refund you the money in your wallet.

Another piece of advice, if you‚Äôre planning on getting into the MOB life, or any of this international dating, start learning a language. Not only will it earn you huge bonus points when talking to these women, you may actually need it sometime. And if she is only just learning English, it is a great time helping each other learn a language. Buy a $40 pair of AI translator earbuds, wear them all the time, and narrate everything you do.

She has maybe a third grade English level, my Russian is maybe sixth grade, and we spent three days talking to each other through a translator, and it was a riot. But you probably don‚Äôt wanna do that forever.

Like LoveScout and other here say you just have to be willing to travel. It will cost me $900 to fly to Rome and $65 to fly her there. Worth it.

ps. Yes, sex work is rampant on the site. If you don‚Äôt want a bunch of unsolicited nudes (yes, it gets tiring) and aren‚Äôt looking at the Philippines, just block the whole county. And if you want to video chat, ABSOLUTELY see point 3. They‚Äôre 70¬¢ a minute on the site, and free on WhatsApp and TG. ",1,1740433791.0,MailOrderBrideFacts,0,1.0,False

Mira looked at the shrunken husk that had once been her father. He lay in a hospital bed under layers of heavy blankets, slowly forgetting how to breathe. He let out a gasp. His frail ribcage heaved with rapid, shallow breaths. Then, for a long moment, there were no breaths at all, until another rattling gasp and heave escaped his chest. The chill autumn wind seemed to breathe with him through the cracks in the windowsill.

Next to the bed, Mira fidgeted on the hard wooden stool. The small bedroom was hot and stuffy; her pink sweater and gray slacks were damp with sweat. Her stomach churned at the thought that the smell of death would linger on her clothes, following her wherever she went. Her sparse lunch tried to lodge itself in her throat. Mira swallowed it back down.

She frowned at her younger sister Grace, who stood behind their father's balding head. At twenty-nine, Grace still looked like a teenager. Her blue hair, red t-shirt, purple pants, and black combat boots were more suitable for a punk show at a dive bar than for a deathbed vigil.

Their father's eyes opened wide. He scanned the room as if searching for something no one else could see. An old silver scar gleamed on the pale skin under his left eye. His mouth moved but no sound came out. Their father raised a trembling hand.

Grasping his cold hand, Mira pressed the back of it to her hot cheek. She leaned close to her father's face and said, ‚ÄúIt's ok, Dad. You can let go now. I love you.‚Äù She looked at her sister. ‚ÄúGrace, tell him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCerebral net status,‚Äù Grace said out loud to her neural link. Her eyes scanned the data received by her retinal link. She then glanced at the array of microscanners and sensors hovering like a halo over her father's head. At a thought from Grace, her neural link sent a list of minor modifications to the halo. The faint blue glow turned red while it made the adjustments.

‚ÄúFor God's sake! Tell Dad he can go!‚Äù Mira said.

Grace raised her eyebrows and glanced down at her father with piercing blue eyes that matched his and Mira‚Äôs. ‚ÄúStop holding on. It's your time, old man.‚Äù She turned to Mira. ‚ÄúHow was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrace‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Their father gasped one more time and then, nothing.

Mira and Grace held their breath.

The hospice nurse stepped forward and placed his gloved fingers on their father's neck. Then he put his stethoscope on their father‚Äôs chest. The silence seemed to last forever.

‚ÄúHe's gone,‚Äù he said.

Mira placed her father's limp hand on the bed. Tears pooled in her eyes. She covered her mouth to stifle a sob.

Grace said, ‚ÄúDownload stats.‚Äù She scanned the readout. The corners of her mouth lifted. ‚ÄúMira, I got them. It worked.‚Äù

Mira shook her head. ‚ÄúWhat? How much‚Äî‚Äù

Grace grinned. ‚ÄúEverything from the last thirty-five years!‚Äù

\#

Mira followed Grace into her office at Cerebri Corp. She stared at the spacious room and floor-to-ceiling windows as the soundproof door slid shut behind her. While Grace was on track to become CEO, Mira was one of Cerebri Corp's many faceless, voiceless accountants, destined to be forever hidden in a tiny basement cubicle.

She sat across from Grace and tried to ignore the chair as it automatically adjusted to her height and posture. Mira frowned at the walls instead; they shone a dull gray with muddy brown streaks. The luminescent coating was programmed to shimmer with a rainbow of colors that changed with the time of day, the emotions of the viewer, and myriad other factors. It was something Grace had developed when she was an undergrad.¬†*I bet she never sees any ugly colors*, she thought.

‚ÄúI skimmed the files to get an idea of what the cerebral net was able to download,‚Äù Grace said. Her eyes were bright, her skin radiant.

Mira stifled a sigh. Her eyes looked bruised and abused from two days spent crying and barely sleeping. The wall color shifted; red streaks infiltrated the brown. Her face felt hot. She took deep breaths until the red faded away. ‚ÄúHe didn't want this. He didn't want us digging through his private li‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything was fucking private! I doubt even Mom knew him. That‚Äôs probably why she left.‚Äù Grace turned to her console. ‚ÄúHow do you love someone you don't know?‚Äù

‚ÄúI loved him,‚Äù Mira said.

‚ÄúYou loved an idea of him.‚Äù

Mira grimaced. ‚ÄúI knew him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's gone. I want you to leave him alone.‚Äù Mira choked back a sob.

Grace stiffened. ‚ÄúDad was always alone. Both he and that house were so fucking cold. Especially after Evan died.‚Äù She drew in a long breath before whispering, ‚ÄúI have to know if he ever loved me.‚Äù

Mira felt her scratchy eyes fill with tears. ‚ÄúOh, Grace‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he didn't, I won't feel bad I didn't cry for the bastard.‚Äù Grace spun around to face Mira. ‚ÄúAt his age, his childhood memories were too degraded to download, so we'll have to start in his early twenties when he was a scout in the war. That would‚Äôve been just before The Desolation.‚Äù

Mira shuddered. She remembered her high school history teacher describing The Great Desolation as if she were reading the day's weather report. ‚ÄúAt the end of the war, a doomsday device was detonated in Beratonia. When their shield dome unexpectedly vanished, our troops searched the entire country and found no one, living or dead. All signs of civilization had vanished without a trace. It's unknown to this day who did it or why.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't want to see that,‚Äù Mira said.

Grace continued, ‚ÄúI scanned for any specific events that could have been traumatic for him. We‚Äôll start with those. Unfortunately, the Memento Vita project is still in the early stages. It can show us what Dad saw and heard, but not what he felt or thought.‚Äù She handed Mira a pair of wrap-around, thin-lensed glasses. ‚ÄúYou really should get retinal and neural links, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even want the aural‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThe glasses will act like a retinal link and auto-connect with your aural link. It might feel overwhelming. Just relax and remember, it‚Äôs not real. We're only along for the ride.‚Äù

*Patronizing as always*, Mira thought. She watched Grace recline in her chair and shut her eyes. Mira fumbled around for a button or lever; she let out a small yelp when the chair reclined on its own. Her aural link emitted a hum when she slid the glasses on. The lenses turned opaque.

At first, there was darkness and silence. And then...

Bright sunlight streamed through the bare trees. The wind whispered through the branches. Small tufts of scraggly brown grass dotted the dry forest floor.

The scout touched his watch. A holo of a compass and map with a blinking dot appeared above the screen. He dismissed it and walked until he came to a deep hollow. He slid down into it, sat on the ground with his back to a rotting log, and set down his pack. He pulled a tiny, military-issue pill box out of his pocket. The lid was labeled 'caffeine' in red letters. He popped a tablet into his mouth. After drinking some water from his canteen, the man leaned back and closed his eyes for several moments.

When he opened them, the pack was gone. He jumped up and peered out of the hollow. A soldier in enemy uniform sprinted away, clutching his pack.

The scout chased after him.

The enemy ran toward a pile of boulders that stood near an energy shield.

The scout lost sight of him. He pulled a small pistol from its holster and slowly advanced toward the boulders. Circling them, he found nothing. The soldier was gone.

‚ÄúFucking hell,‚Äù he whispered. He walked to the edge of the energy shield. The shimmering gray wall rose out of sight. The surface rippled like water when the wind touched it. Partially liquified remains of squirrels and birds littered the bare ground nearby. There were no openings in sight.

The scout moved away from the shield and squatted on the other side of the rocks. Popping another caffeine tablet, he stared at the yellow lichen that grew in circular patches over the craggy granite. One of the boulders winked out of existence for a second, as if he had blinked. Then the boulder flickered and reappeared.

The man moved closer. The stone quivered and vanished, revealing a tunnel. He tapped the light on his left shoulder. A red circle illuminated the tunnel entrance. He stuck his head inside. It was silent. Pistol in hand, he crawled inside on his hands and knees. He followed the tunnel as it sloped down and then up again. It ended at another boulder. When he touched it with the barrel of his gun, the rock vanished.

He peered out into a dim, gray world. His breath misted in the air. The dome of the energy shield hovered high overhead like a permanent cloud cover. Scattered nearby were dead trees and animal bones. The crumbling remains of a small village peeked through patchy fog.

Twenty feet ahead, the enemy soldier crouched. His back was to the scout. There were no other soldiers in sight.

Creeping closer, the scout raised his aphonic pistol and fired.

The soldier stiffened and collapsed. Red blood seeped from the hole in his chest into the mud.

The scout turned the body over with his foot. The soldier was a boy, no more than thirteen years old. The dirty, threadbare uniform of a much larger man dwarfed his emaciated body. Clutched in his hand was a meal bar.

A whimper came from behind the scout. He turned.

Another young, thin boy stepped out of the bushes. As he walked toward the scout with filthy hands outstretched, blood bloomed from a hole in his throat.

Bullets whizzed past. The scout dove behind a boulder. The top of the rock exploded. A granite shard hit his left cheek.

Soldiers swarmed over the scout. They took his gun and knocked him to the ground. Someone kicked him in the ribs.

The scout curled up.

Laughter rang out. The soldiers rolled the scout onto his back and searched his pockets.

The scout stared at the energy shield above. Red streaks had diffused into the shimmering gray as if a painter had dipped a brush filled with vermillion pigment into murky water. The red seeped out of the sky, coloring the edges of his vision.

One soldier said, ‚ÄúVoster anta restret?‚Äù

The scout was silent.

‚ÄúVoster anta restret?‚Äù

‚ÄúRot in hell, bastards.‚Äù

Another soldier pulled out a knife. He dug the tip into the scout's shoulder, pushing harder and harder.

The world turned crimson. It glowed brighter and brighter.

The scout screamed. Blinding white light filled his vision.

Everything went black.

The scout cracked open his eyes. Sunlight shone into them. He blinked and sat up with a groan. The fog had cleared.

The soldiers were gone. So was the dome.

The scout pulled himself to his knees and rose to his feet. Shading his eyes, he scanned the horizon. The village was gone. There was nothing but brown mud dotted with puddles of red.

Mira ripped off her glasses. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Grace sat up and opened her eyes. ‚ÄúThe Bleeding Fields. Dad must have been there when the doomsday device went off.‚Äù She rubbed her face. ‚ÄúBut how the fuck did he survive when nothing else did?‚Äù

Staring at the carpet, Mira felt her breakfast creep its way up her throat. She swallowed it back down. ‚ÄúI don't want to see anymore. That's obviously what made him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMom said he'd been tortured as a POW. That they'd cut out his tongue. We haven't seen that yet. We need to keep going.‚Äù Grace closed her eyes and leaned back.

Mira reached into her pocket and clutched a crumpled paper before she put on her glasses and followed Grace back in.

The scout tore off his sleeve and struggled to bandage his shoulder one-handed. He walked past the place where the village had been. The sun left its zenith and began its slow descent. A landscape of muck and red polka-dots remained unchanged until the scout came to a series of crimson ponds. He spun around and searched the horizon. A crow circling overhead was the only thing that moved.

He checked his map. The dot placed him in the center of a large city. He scanned the attached intelligence file. It noted a pre-war population of three million.

Red tinted the sky. The man sat on a rock and rubbed his face. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a small signal mirror, and held it up. His jaw glowed, turning the spatters of dirt and blood into black specks.

Footsteps squelched in the mud. The scout turned his head.

Soldiers wearing the same uniform as his surrounded him with aphonic pistols raised. Each man was tinged with red.

‚ÄúGre nata deta! Raise your hands!‚Äù

The scout glanced back at the mirror. His jaw blazed scarlet. He opened his mouth. White light poured out. He turned to the soldiers and yelled, ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù

There was a bright flash and then darkness. When the scout opened his eyes, the soldiers were gone.

With trembling hands, the scout held up the mirror again. His face looked normal. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù he whispered. He took a knife from his belt. He raised it to his throat. After several moments, he lowered it. Tears blurred his vision.

The man fell to his knees in the mud and jammed the mirror into a crack in the rock. ‚ÄúWhy is this happening?‚Äù he screamed at his reflection.

The fringes of his vision filled with red. He opened his mouth. His tongue shined dazzling white. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. The mirror disappeared in a puff of dust.

In one quick movement, the scout lifted his knife and swung it in front of his face. Blood splattered the rock. He watched his tongue splash into the red muck, its brilliant glow fading away.

Everything went black.

Mira and Grace sat up. They were silent for several minutes, each lost in her own thoughts.

Mira rolled her tongue around in her mouth to confirm it was still there; it throbbed where she must have bitten it. ‚ÄúWe've seen enough. We have to stop!‚Äù

Grace shook her head. ‚ÄúThere's another memory I need to see.‚Äù She picked up her coffee mug. Her hand trembled.

‚ÄúGrace, please. I can't‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen don't!‚Äù Grace slammed her mug on the desk. Cold coffee splashed onto her hand.

Mira flinched and said, ‚ÄúWhat memory?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe day Evan died.‚Äù

Mira blanched. Evan had been home sick that day, so Mom had taken the girls to school on her way to work. Dad was supposed to be home watching him. In the police statement, Dad had noted that he had run to the pharmacy around the corner to get medicine while Evan was sleeping. When he returned, Evan was dead. The police had ruled it an accidental death.

Grace leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes.

Taking deep breaths, Mira leaned back.

Evan lay in his bed with his eyes closed. His breaths were shallow and fast. His chubby cheeks were flushed red.

His father touched the watch on Evan's wrist. On the strap, the cartoon dog and boy wearing a white bear hat danced. The screen flashed a temperature of 102.5¬∞ F. The man walked to the adjoining bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet. A full bottle of children's cold medicine sat on the top shelf. He poured the orange goop into the small measuring cup and took it to the bedroom. He nudged Evan awake.

Evan opened his eyes. He groaned, trying to roll over.

His father helped the boy sit up and gestured that he take the medicine.

‚ÄúEwww, don‚Äôt want it,‚Äù Evan murmured.

The man sighed. He held the back of Evan‚Äôs head and pushed the cup to his lips.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Evan knocked it out of his hand. The cup hit the wall, splattering orange goop. The boy struggled against his father. His flushed face darkened. A faint light shone from between his clenched teeth.

His father jumped off the bed and stumbled back into the wall.

Evan whimpered. The light in his mouth grew brighter until his jaw glowed.

The man turned and ran down the hall to the storage closet. He dug in the drawers for a large pair of sewing shears. He grabbed them and dashed back to Evan's room. Before entering, he hid the shears behind his back.

Tears streamed down Evan's cheeks. His lips trembled.

His father brought his index finger to his lips and shook his head as he sat on the edge of the bed. The man grasped Evan's chin and pointed his mouth away from his face. He pulled the boy's mouth open with one hand. The other raised the shears.

Evan's eyes opened wide. His tongue moved as if he was about to speak.

His father flinched and ducked.

The boy wriggled out of his father's grasp, leaped out of bed, and ran into the hall.

His father chased Evan down the stairs.

Evan flew toward the back of the house. He dashed out the door and into the yard in his bare feet.

The man ran outside, scissors still clutched in his hand.

Wet brown maple leaves coated the yard and surface of the in-ground pool.

Evan sprinted alongside the water. He slid on a patch of leaves, pitched backward, and slammed his head against the concrete patio.

The man stopped. He stared at Evan.

Evan lay still.

He walked to the boy's side and knelt.

Evan‚Äôs eyes stared at the sky, unblinking. His breaths came in irregular gasps interspersed with long moments of nothing as if he couldn‚Äôt remember how to breathe. The boy's mouth lolled open. The glow of his tongue dimmed to an ember.

His father closed Evan's mouth. He brushed the boy‚Äôs bangs out of his eyes and caressed his cheek. He pushed the boy closer to the edge of the pool.

Then his father rolled Evan into the deep end.

Rippling waves sent a flurry of dead leaves sinking to the bottom.

The man stood and went into the house without a second glance. He put the shears away. He scrubbed the bedroom wall clean of orange goo and poured the remaining medicine down the drain.

The man went downstairs, put on his shoes and coat, and walked out the front door.

Mira pulled off her glasses. Her chest felt tight. She clenched her jaw to hold back a scream.

Grace sat up, her face blank.

Neither woman moved or spoke for a long time.

Mira finally said, ‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù

Grace blinked and shook her head. ‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad killed Evan.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think Dad killed a lot more people than our little brother,‚Äù Grace said. She spoke to her console. ‚ÄúWhat was the population of Beratonia before the Desolation?‚Äù

A pleasant disembodied voice responded, ‚ÄúOne-hundred and fifty-three million people.‚Äù

The glasses slipped from Mira's fingers. ‚ÄúYou think Dad did that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe saw it. He was the only one who survived.‚Äù

Mira slid her hand into her pocket. She clutched the paper. ‚ÄúNo, he wouldn't‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt looked like Evan could do it, too, whatever it was.‚Äù Grace smirked. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out for Dad. An accidental drowning is easier to explain than cutting out your kid's tongue.‚Äù

Mira glared at Grace. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you approve of what he did.‚Äù

Grace shrugged. ‚ÄúDo you still love him after what you've seen?‚Äù

‚ÄúI... I don't know. He was a monster.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did what he had to do,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúHe was supposed to protect his child, not kill him.‚Äù Mira‚Äôs tongue throbbed in time with the headache that pulsed behind her eyes. ‚ÄúShould we tell someone about Beratonia? The government or something?‚Äù

Grace snorted. ‚ÄúChrist, Mira. Think! We'd get hauled off to some secret lab and tested like guinea pigs. Do you want that?‚Äù She pointed to the dime-sized data crystal sitting on the transceiver pad of her console. ‚ÄúThankfully, I only stored Dad‚Äôs memories locally. No one else at the company has access.‚Äù

The walls swirled a sickly yellow-green. Mira's stomach heaved. She slipped to her knees, grabbed the trash can, and vomited up her breakfast.

Grace's eyes softened. She handed Mira a bottle of water. ‚ÄúYou ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, I'm not ok.‚Äù Mira's stomach heaved again. She reached into her pocket for a tissue. A piece of paper fell out.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù Grace asked.

‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù Mira reached for it.

Grace lunged and snatched up the paper. ‚ÄúThis is Dad's handwriting. Where did you get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was in the safe with his will. It didn't make sense until now.‚Äù

Grace read it out loud.

‚ÄúTo Mira and Grace, I caused The Desolation. I spent years searching for the reason I was cursed with this terrible power. When I didn't find one, I wanted to die. Then you girls and Evan were born, and you gave me a reason to live. But I passed my curse on to Evan, and maybe to you, too. I should have killed all of us when I realized. I was a coward. Do what needs to be done. Kill yourselves before it‚Äôs too late.

‚ÄúLet this evil end with us.‚Äù

The letter slid from Grace's fingers onto the floor. ‚ÄúHe passed it on to us...‚Äù She pulled a bottle of vodka out of a desk drawer, poured some into her cup, and took a gulp. The mix of leftover coffee and vodka made her grimace. ‚ÄúI guess all of this explains why he chose sign language over a neural link and voice generator.‚Äù

Mira shoved the paper back into her pocket. ‚ÄúSo what do we do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet drunk for starters. The fuck if I know after that.‚Äù Grace picked up what looked like a silver pen off the workbench next to her desk. ‚ÄúWe could use this laser cutter to remove our tongues. Or slit our throats.‚Äù

Holding up the bottle, Grace said, ‚ÄúDrink up, my dear, cursed sister. It could've been worse. At least we don't have children.‚Äù

Mira's lips quivered. Her hand went to her stomach.

Grace's eyes widened. ‚ÄúOh, my God. Tell me it's not true!‚Äù

Mira wrapped her arms around her abdomen and didn't respond.

Grace began to laugh hysterically. When she got herself under control again, she wiped her eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou always make the worst fucking life choices. I don't understand how we're related.‚Äù She took a swig of vodka straight from the bottle. ‚ÄúYou know you have to get rid of it.‚Äù

Mira glared at the walls. Red threaded into the murky yellow-green.

‚ÄúMira, did you hear me? You can't have this baby. It's too dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt kill my child.‚Äù

Grace slammed the bottle on the desk. ‚ÄúDad wiped out an entire country by accident. What happens if your child has a temper tantrum? They might destroy the whole world!‚Äù

The walls turned a deep crimson that pulsed in time with the pain in Mira's head and tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like Dad!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre not like Dad! He did what he had to do.‚Äù

Crimson seeped into the edges of Mira's vision. ‚ÄúI'll go somewhere far away. You'll never see me again. If you destroy the memory files‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, Grace. I've never asked you for anything. Just let me‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don't have an abortion, I'll send the files to the news outlets,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúYou can't! They'll figure out who Dad is. They'll take my baby and you and I will end up prisoners in some secret lab like you said.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat thing will cause another Desolation,‚Äù Grace said.

‚ÄúThat thing is your nephew or niece,‚Äù Mira said quietly.

‚ÄúWho could kill every creature on Earth!‚Äù

Mira stood and said, ‚ÄúI won't let that happen. Erase the files.‚Äù

Grace smiled. It failed to reach her eyes. ‚ÄúI'll erase the files once you‚Äôve erased that abomination.‚Äù

Mira blinked. The whole world was painted red. Her tongue burned like she was sucking on a hot coal.

‚ÄúMira, your face!‚Äù Grace jumped up and backed away. ‚ÄúDon't say anything!‚Äù

Mira slapped both hands over her mouth. Her body trembled.

‚ÄúShit! Shit! Shit! Try to stay calm, ok?‚Äù Grace grabbed the laser cutter. ‚ÄúI can remove your tongue with this. It‚Äôll cauterize the wound so you don't bleed out.‚Äù

Mira‚Äôs eyes widened. She shook her head and stepped back.

Grace took a step toward her. She spoke in a quiet, soothing voice. ‚ÄúWe have to, Mira.‚Äù

Mira moved one hand from her mouth to her stomach.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll worry about that later. Right now, let's do what we have to do.‚Äù Grace took another step toward Mira. And another.

Mira ducked her head and shook it harder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid! It‚Äôs not like you ever had anything to say anyway!‚Äù Grace snapped.

Mira's head jerked up.

The sisters glared at one another.

Finally, Mira nodded. She stopped trembling as her hand fell away from her mouth.

Grace lifted the laser. ‚ÄúThis will hurt. I'm sorry.‚Äù

Mira caressed Grace‚Äôs cheek. Then she took a big step back and closed her eyes. ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù she whispered.

There was a blinding flash. When Mira opened her eyes, Grace was gone. A pool of blood seeped into the green carpet, turning it a muddy brown.

She wiped the tears from her face with the heels of her hands. She kept her breathing slow and even until the pain in her mouth faded away. ‚ÄúI had plenty to say. You just never listened,‚Äù Mira whispered.

She went to Grace‚Äôs desk and grabbed the data crystal. She dropped it on the floor and ground the heel of her shoe into it. Once she was certain it was pulverized, she threw back her head and yelled, ‚ÄúTHIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO!‚Äù

Mira felt a tiny flutter in her stomach. She placed a hand over it. The shimmering walls glowed the golden yellow of a sun-dappled afternoon as she walked out of the office without looking back.",2,1740433700.0,SignalHorrorFiction,0,1.0,False

----

**Welcome to FC Dallas's entry in the Countdown to Kickoff!**

12 year streak! Holy shit, can't believe it. Outside of the very first time /r/MLS did Countdown to Kickoff, I've written every single entry for FC Dallas.

~~This year it's not actually late, given that it's a lot looser and less scheduled than previous years, and yet still only barely squeaking in before the deadline.~~ Hahaha I got sick again and lost 3 days of writing time. Love that for me, traditions never die.

But keeping with the other traditions, a little look backwards. The first one of these I wrote was for the 2014 season. It went up on 22 Feb, 2014.

In 2014, we only had 52 professional teams across men's and women's leagues throughout the pyramid. We had MLS, NASL, and USL Pro, and for women's, the NWSL in its second season.

Back then, /r/MLS had 18,575 subscribers and MLS had 19 teams. Chivas USA were beginning what would be their final season. LA Galaxy launched Galaxy 2 in USL Pro, beginning the MLS professional second team era. Sacramento Republic FC made their debut and went on to win the USL Pro Championship over Harrisburg City Islanders (RIP).

Now, for 2025, we have 30 teams in MLS alone, 119 overall (excluding NISA because, well, NISA), and /r/MLS itself has grown to just under a million subscribers (955,776 at time of writing), a 51X increase.

It's been amazing watching this league, and this community, grow exponentially since then, spreading soccer to more and more places and people. If you're reading this, I'm glad you're here! And maybe someday, you'll be writing one of these posts yourself, for a team that doesn't exist yet either.

Let's get into it.

#Rivalries:

1. **Texas Derby vs Houston Dynamo** - The Texas Derby, the biggest rivalry in Texas bar none. Since San Jose's relocation to the Lone Star State in 2006 (and subsequent MLS Cup successes), the inherent hatred between the DFW Metroplex and Houston has only grown stronger in MLS. The two sides compete for ""El Capit√°n"", a [massive fucking Civil War-era Howitzer cannon](https://images.mlssoccer.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/f_auto/mls-dal-prd/bmx39ebeuiwntz2sacll.jpg) that's still fully operational. It's the coolest trophy in sports and I will tolerate no arguments to the contrary. Dallas has won it the last 3 seasons and is unbeated against Houston since April 2022.

2. **FC Dallas Fans vs [The Dallas North Tollway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_North_Tollway)** - Even though we completed our first ever sellout season last year, that damn tollway is still front of the mind. DFW, despite the reputation, actually has a competent, if not cromulent, public transit network that can get you from most parts of the Metroplex to the airport, downtown in either city, up to my city of Denton, wherever you need to go - except for Frisco and Arlington. Infuriating. So instead we must drive, and not only drive, but pay for the privilege of the one major road to the stadium.

3. **Copa Tejas** - Another complicated story, of a new Texan MLS team with a dubious origin story. Austin got their team, and leapfrogged San Antonio in the process, with a good deal of questionable conduct from Precourt Sports Ventures. Fortunately, San Antonio still survives in USL, The Crew were saved, and now Texas has 3 MLS teams. Since the Texas Derby already has one team involving Californians relocating to Texas, a new trophy was created, based on the already existing USL Copa Tejas. Dallas won the inaugural one in 2021 and last season's as well.

4. **FC Dallas vs Sporting KC in the Open Cup** - Way back in 2004, Dallas first played Kansas City in the Open Cup, and Kansas City won 4-0. Fast-forward over a decade to 2015, and once again, Dallas drew Kansas City in the Open Cup. Kansas City once again won by 4, with a 6-2 final score. Since then, Dallas has faced Kansas City in the Open Cup four more times, in 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2024. Kansas City won all 4 games. Last year, things were 1-1 into extra-time, before Dany Rosero became the last SKC player to end our cup run. Dallas has never beaten SKC in Open Cup play, ever, and I have no idea how or why it keeps happening.

5. **Brimstone Cup vs Chicago Fire** - Back when MLS was young, Dallas was the Burn, and MLS had a Central Division, some passionate supporters created the Brimstone Cup, celebrating the legitimate animosity between Dallas and Chicago during the 2001 season and playoffs. Unfortunately, the following season, the Central Division was eliminated and Dallas and Chicago found themselves in separate conferences. Through 2011, the league managed to scheduled at least two matches between the sides, but for 2020 and 2021, there were none. 2022 brought it back to Soldier Field for the first time since 2005 in a 0-0 draw featuring 6 yellow cards. This year it's back once again, with Dallas hosting Chicago in March.

6. **FC Dallas Fans vs FC Dallas Front Office** - The biggest year-round rivalry, FC Dallas fans have been questioning the decisions of The Powers That Hunt for as long as they've been involved with the team. Despite the Hunts and FO putting in efforts for marketing (culminating in a sellout season for 2024 despite missing the playoffs), the new stadium renovations, and some exciting new signings (Bienvenidos, Lucho), there will be *something*. Recently it's been more supporter drama, in no small part stemming from the renovations, and also the impression of the sky falling based on the recent roster cull. More on that below.

7. **Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup vs Columbus Crew SC** - Less a true rivalry than a point of interesting MLS history, the Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup celebrates two of the three teams Lamar Hunt owned before his passing in December of 2006. Lamar Hunt was a football man at heart (including founding the American Football League and creating the Super Bowl), but converted to soccer as the NASL came together, owning the Dallas Tornado for their entire existence. When MLS came together, he owned Columbus and Kansas City, paid for Columbus's first stadium in 1998 (MLS's first dedicated stadium), saved the league from collapse in 2001, and bought the struggling Dallas Burn in 2003. Under Uncle Lamar's stewardship, FC Dallas got its new name, its own stadium, and its now famous academy. If you're wondering why Dallas fans got so vitriolic during the \#SaveTheCrew saga, now you know. Outside of MLS, he also helped bring the World Cup to the USA in 1994, and the entire Open Cup tournament is named in his honour. Thank you, Uncle Lamar.

8. **The Rest** - At different points in time, Dallas has had rather substantial beefs with much of the Western Conference. Seems like at least one fan from every Western team on /r/MLS hates FC Dallas for something, and we probably hate them for something too.

Big thing to note, the roster is 2-or-3-deep at almost every position, so there's likely to be near-constant rotation.

#2024 Season in Review

* **Final Standings:** 11th in West, 19th overall, 11-8-15 record, 41 pts, -2 GD
* **Playoffs:** DNQ
* **Attendance:** 19,096 (all-time record, sellout)

Let's go check out what I wrote last year...

Ah, yes.

""Worst Case:
You know the drill, everything goes full \#FlamingMeteor, and things look more like 2021, or god forbid, worse, and players start demanding trades. This is FC Dallas, after all, and inexplicable collapse is in our DNA.""

Well, damn. That was accurate.

FC Dallas started the 2024 season with a 2-1 home win against San Jose in February. Then they lost *all 4 games in March*, played two scoreless draws against St Louis and Seattle, lost *again*. and got their 2nd win in game 9. A third win in Game 11, in May, proved to be the final win for Nico Estevez, and after a fifth consecutive winless match (1-1 in Minnesota), he was sacked.

Peter Luccin was called up for the remaining slightly-over-half of the season, having served as an assistant to Estevez and Luchi previously.

The team immediately won their first two games under Luccin (including a 5-3 stomping of Minnesota), and looked *better*, but not necessarily *good*, and were still on the outside looking in at the playoffs.

Oh, and losing. Like, a lot. The team lost 8 of the 16 games under Nico, and still lost 7 more in the 18 with Luccin.

The lone good: the sellout streak. Yes, it's tickets sold, not tickets scanned, and yes, the number isn't much in modern MLS context, but still. Last season, for the first time ever, FC Dallas sold out all 17 regular season games, all 19,096 tickets, reaching the apex for the post-HOF capacity, after already setting a new high water mark in 2023.

What went wrong?

In a nutshell, a bit of everything. Nico lost the locker room early, and the frustrations in the players (particularly though not exclusively Ferreira) meant that if the team was on the back foot, they were likely going to get in their own heads and play even worse. Luccin helped that mentality some, but at the expense of any semblance of defence. Dallas went from one of the more defencively sound teams in MLS, to openly sacrificing defencive play to find goals.

It's not a bad strategy if your roster is young and healthy, though. But FC Dallas? Yeah, nah, neither young *nor* healthy. Ferreira, Pomykal, Velasco, and Geovane Jesus all battled injuries and recovery. Ibeagha, Illarramendi, Lletget, and Omar Gonzalez were all worked harder than guys in their 30s can reliably be worked. Emergency signings abounded to patch over the holes in the roster, young players from NTSC were getting called up just to get beat down, it was a mess.

And so, FC Dallas ended 2024 looking a lot like the team from 2021. Overworked, hurt, frustrated, and nowhere near the postseason. And half the roster wanted out.

----

#Transfers Out:

* **Jesus Ferreira (FW) to Seattle Sounders** - The big trade that everyone was talking about, face of the franchise, often leading scorer, and the primary forward before Musa. ""I'm shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked."" He'd wanted out, and after MLS axed a move to Russia due to the everything involved with a multi-million dollar transaction with a Russian business, he was either sulking on the pitch or injured. Maybe Seattle is what he needs to rest and reset.

* **Paul Arriola (FW) to Seattle Sounders** - Oh look, another big name, big ticket player going to Seattle! This definitely had people freaking out in the FCD spaces. But this was purely pragmatic. Arriola is good, but was getting paid superstar, hard-carry-the-entire-team money and just wasn't worth his wages.

* **Alan Velasco (MF) to Boca Juniors (ARG)** - Easiest piece of business FCD has ever done. Yes, Velasco was by far the best player on the roster besides maybe Musa, but he was not Reject-$10 Million-from-Boca good. Especially coming off a torn ACL. He'd wanted a move back to Argentina while recovering and rehabbing, and FC Dallas turned it into a colossal profit.

* **Sam Junqua (DF) to Real Salt Lake** - Junqua was a popular, reliable, positive presence for FC Dallas having arrived from those Orange jerks in 2023, and was one of the few strong defenders last season. But when RSL will trade him and some GarberBux for Anderson Julio, again, you take that, especially to replace the above trio. Have fun up there, Sam!

* **Nkosi Tafari (DF) to Los Angeles FC** - Ok, unlike all of the other deals above, this one just sucks. Tafari could be inconsistent and infuriating at times, but when he's on, he's one of the best defenders FC Dallas has had since Matt Hedges. And we got basically nothing in return. He must have *really* wanted out, ASAP.

* **Jose Mulato (FW) to FK Spartak Subotica (SRB)** - Done in the middle of the 2024 season, this was a simple case of ""guy who's great in MLSNP with North Texas SC isn't cut for MLS"". He'd been on loan with San Antonio prior to the sale.

* **Liam Fraser (MF) to Crawley Town (ENG)** - A solid defencive midfielder, Fraser's option was declined purely due to losing the starting spot to Show and having several other options (particularly Ramiro). He's since found a gig in England.

* **Omar Gonzalez (DF) to Chicago Fire** - One of the all-time great American centerbacks, Omar Gonzalez filled in a highly depleted backline for a season. But he's old, the youth players are about ready to start, and it doesn't make sense to bring him back.

* **Dante Sealy (FW) to Impact de Montreal** - Struggled to secure a spot in the first team, struggled to catch on at Jong PSV for a possible move. He's joined Montreal, which should be a great place to hopefully reset and restart his career.

* **Ema Twumasi (DF) out of contract** - Twumasi bounced between FCD and loan jobs before eventually getting Reggie Cannon's old spot at right-back where he was solid if unspectacular when he wasn't injured. There's more depth there, from players who've had fewer injuries. He's the type of guy who could be *the guy* for a USLC side, though.

* **Eugene Ansah (DF) to FC Ashdod (ISR)** - $700K for one goal. That's how Buzz Carrick described him, and there's not much else to say. Between Farrington and Musa, he's just not necessary especially at that salary.

* **Isaiah Parker (DF) out of contract** - Isaiah Parker has been on the roster since 2022 and has played a total of 0 minutes for FC Dallas. He's had some moments for North Texas SC, but he's also spent a lot of time injured. Best for both sides.

* **Amet Korca (DF) to NK Dubrava (HRV)** - FCD Brought back a former DFW area youth player in 2023, and while he looked pretty good for North Texas, once again, didn't work out in MLS. He's gone back to Croatia.

* **Malik Henry-Scott (MF) to Lexington SC** - A bit of an odd one, he'd been doing decent enough on a homegrown contract, but, fine, they've been bringing in more attacking players and have more depth now.

* **Ruan (DF) out of contract** - He was an emergency signing to fill a need at right back. Now, FCD no longer has that need. Thanks for the help, go get signed and paid.

* **Jimmy Maurer (GK) to Houston Dynamo** - Well, shit. We thought he was likely to retire and join the coaching staff, keep him around since he'd been in frisco since 2017. Instead, he's down I-45, shit.

#In Negotiation:

* **Asier Illarramendi (MF)** - Despite only logging 42 games across all competitions since arriving, the Basque defencive midfielder was easily one of the best players on the roster. We'd take him back for the right price, mainly because he's never playing a full season's worth of games at 34.

#Transfers In: 

* **Patrickson Delgado (MF) from Independiente del Valle (ECU)** - Making a loan move permanent, Delgado earned his place in the midfield rotation, and will likely get serious starting minutes behind Acosta, or wherever some extra help is needed.

* **Pedrinho (MF) from North Texas SC** - When your second team wins a league championship off the efforts of a 21-year-old #10, you sign him to the biggest contract you can. This kid is going places, mark my words.

* **Ramiro (MF) from Cruzeiro (BRA)** - Another Zanotta signing via his Gremio connections, Ramiro is primarily a 6 but can play as an 8 or right back, and even though he's on the other side of 30, he's still younger than Illarramendi.

* **Lalas Abubakar (DF) from Colorado Rapids** - Abubakar is a veteran CB who's played for Colorado and Columbus, not necessarily a 30-game-plus starter, but a solid player to shore up one of the weakest spots on the roster.

* **Anderson Julio (FW) from Real Salt Lake** - Acquired in the Sam Junqua trade, Julio immediately jumped to the top of the depth chart at left wing. He's filled the gap that is both wings, while also fitting the Eric Quill system, and he's in the prime of his career.

* **Shaq Moore (DF) from Nashville SC** - With Geovane Jesus still hurt, and Ruan gone, right back was a shallow spot. Getting a player as good as Moore (and also bringing him back to Dallas) who also rotates with Reggie Cannon for the USMNT, for basically pennies, is huge.

* **Leo Chu (MF) from Seattle Sounders** - Received as part of the return for Jesus, another strong option on the wings, naturally a left winger but has played on the right as well. Another Zanotta-type guy, from the Gremio system.

* **Osaze Urhoghide (DF) from Amiens SC (FRA)** - An interesting signing to reinforce the defence (and club record transfer for a defender), Urhoghide has experience in some European 2nd tiers, and he's decently young and can still develop. Not what we expected, but not necessarily a bad idea.

* **Alvaro Augusto (DF) from Portimonense SC (PRT)** - Classic FC Dallas diceroll signing. Young player born in South America that's quick on his feet? Yep, there we go. A long-term development signing that, if it pays off, could be another anchor player, and if not, c'est la vie.

* **Lucho Acosta (MF) from FC Cincinnati** - Buried the lede on this one, eh? Keeps things interested, makes people read more of it. At least I hope. Anyway. After selling Velasco back to Argentina, Dallas needed a #10, and for the Quill system, needed a very specific kind of #10. After swinging and missing on Evander, Dallas landed Acosta for the biggest cash-for-player deal to date within MLS. And he's worth it. MVP in 2023, in the running last year. Hell and/or fuck yeah.

#Homegrowns:

* **Diego Garcia (MF)** - Phenomenal young linking mid who's been a force of nature with NTSC, Garcia joins a growing line of homegrown midfielders (despite being poached from El Paso) who can hold their own as teenagers. Another one to watch.

* **Anthony Ramirez (MF)** - Another young midfielder that the local nerds have been watching for years, he got a cup of coffee in MLS last season due to injuries, can play anywhere in the front half of midfield. Young but already showing more than just promise.

* **Michael Collodi (GK)** - Academy kid who went to Columbia, and then came back to FCD with North Texas a year ago, Collodi won Goalkeeper of the Year in MLSNP, and could overtake Antonio Carrera has the 2nd Choice keeper this year.

* **Malachi Molina (DF)** - Another academy winger-turned-right-back, Molina is reminiscent of Bryan Reynolds in that manor of quick, vertical two-way player. Might not be first team ready, and hasn't fully hit the NTSC starting eleven yet, but he's young with a lot of upside and is more than worth the chance.

* **Diego Pepi (FW)** - Last name sound familiar? Yep, it's Ricardo's baby brother. While he's not turned heads like Pepi the Elder, a homegrown contract down roster isn't a big risk for what could be another long-term youth play.

* **Daniel Baran (FW)** - And another young academy kid who's shown early promise, and got to spend some time with NTSC last season, who'll likely spend a year or three with NTSC before meaningful MLS minutes.

#Draft Picks:

* **R1 S11 - Enzo Newman (DF) from Oregon State**
* *R2 S41 - Samuel Sarver (FW) from Indiana - signed with NTSC* 
* *R3 S71 - Mohamed Cisset (DF) from Penn State - did not sign*

#Prognosis:

Here's the part where I traditionally roll the dice and take multiple different flavours of L.

Last year on the field was a disaster. One of the worst seasons, soccer-wise, in team history. Not as bad as 2021, mind, but in PPG terms, was the 2nd worst season since 2012. The ensuing aftermath kicking into maximum rebuild mode had the fans losing their fucking minds on /r/FCDallas and in threads on here, and also likely other places that aren't Reddit but these comment sections are chaotic enough already. Anyway.

There's a lot of overhaul here, the roster looks completely different, and in a lot of ways, it's a return to the methodology from the Pareja/Luchi ""play the kids"" era more than the Estevez ""sign the vets"" strategy. And while it might not look pretty, especially not at first, it's a method that took Dallas to the 2016 Shield and Open Cup Double. In short, it's IMHO the exact sort of pivot the team needs.

Meanwhile, off the field, the 19,096 sellout streak that covered the entire 2024 season will unfortunately be coming to an end, but for the best possible reason: the stadium is being almost entirely rebuilt to take it from MLS 2.0-Spec standards, up to something in line with all the new venues. A lot to look forward to.

And with that, the 3 scenarios.

#Best Case:

Despite the reduced capacity, the sellout streak continues, and the overhauled roster plays exciting and entertaining soccer. Even if Dallas doesn't run the table, a playoff berth and a season of highlight-reel moments sets the tone for the new era under Eric Quill. The ""Play The Kids"" mentality sets the team up for another strong window, leading FC Dallas to restore a lot of recently lost prestige.

#Worst Case:

It's kinda hard to think of a proper full \#FlamingMeteor worst case, given the complete overhaul, and that unless things are *dire*, like, under a point per game *dire*, then there's not much of a failure state. It's a rebuild, so maybe it's just unwatchable by the second half of the season.

#Reasonable Case:

Kids continue to develop. A few of the long-term injured players make their returns, and slowly find their legs again. The rebuilt spine learns to play together, maybe not the most attractive soccer, but finds a way to make it work. ""Busca La Forma"", if you will. Despite the renovations, people keep showing up, and even if the team isn't winning, it's still fun.

----

#Concluding Remarks

I'm tempering my expectations even further this time around. I usually like to take a pretty big swing for the Best Case scenario, and once, in 2016, actually underestimated it. I'm hoping for something of the same this time. This is a very different team, more like an expansion team than a rebuilt 1996er Original. And that's really exciting! It's been a hot minute since FC Dallas really changed things up, and last time we did around a decade ago led to the highest high points for the team to date.

I'm excited! And genuinely optimistic. There's a lot to like about this roster, this coaching staff, and especially the ""new"" stadium. A new look FC Dallas for a very new looking MLS, just what we've wanted for years.

Here's hoping I don't look stupid come August.

Again.

1ixdxjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1ixdxjw/word_of_wisdom_or_lack_thereof/,Word of Wisdom (Or lack thereof),"As I've been observing our congregation lately, I couldn't help but notice that many of the members are overweight or obese. I also couldn't help but think that many people sitting there are likely addicted to their soda drinks. This brings me to the Word of Wisdom. While this guideline aims to promote physical well-being, it‚Äôs worth questioning whether excluding these beverages truly aligns with achieving optimal health outcomes, especially when it comes to weight management and overall well-being.

**Health Benefits of Coffee and Tea**

Extensive research indicates that both coffee and tea offer numerous health benefits:

* **Antioxidant Properties**: Coffee and tea are rich in antioxidants, which combat free radicals and reduce inflammation. This action helps lower the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.
* **Cognitive Function and Mental Health**: The caffeine in coffee enhances alertness and cognitive performance. Tea, especially green tea, contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress without causing drowsiness.
* **Weight Management**: Both beverages can aid in weight loss efforts. The caffeine in coffee boosts metabolism and increases fat burning, while tea, particularly green tea, has been associated with fat loss and improved metabolic health.

**Obesity Rates Among LDS Church Members**

Despite adherence to the Word of Wisdom, studies have shown that LDS Church members may experience higher rates of overweight and obesity compared to other populations:

* Research conducted at Brigham Young University found that Mormons are 34% more likely to be overweight than members of other religions.
* A study published in the *Review of Religious Research* indicated that members of the LDS Church have a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity compared to non-members.

**Reevaluating the Word of Wisdom**

Given the documented health benefits of coffee and tea, and the higher rates of overweight and obesity among LDS members, it may be prudent to reassess the dietary restrictions outlined in the Word of Wisdom. Incorporating these beverages could potentially offer health advantages that align with the original intent of promoting well-being.

It's important to note that the health benefits of coffee and tea are most pronounced when consumed without excessive sugar or high-calorie additives. Moderation is key, as excessive caffeine intake can lead to adverse effects such as anxiety and insomnia.

While the Word of Wisdom aims to enhance health, current evidence suggests that moderate consumption of coffee and tea could provide significant health benefits, including improved weight management and reduced risk of chronic diseases. Revisiting these guidelines may help address the higher prevalence of overweight and obesity within the LDS community.",1,1740433466.0,mormon,2,1.0,False

1ixdxdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ixdxdf/the_house_my_father_built/,The House My Father Built.,"I need to get this out before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve been sitting on it for weeks, pacing my apartment, the hardwood creaking under my socks, the radiator hissing like a cornered cat. My hands shake as I type, the laptop‚Äôs glow stinging my bloodshot eyes. I haven‚Äôt slept in days‚Äînot since I went back to that place. If you‚Äôre reading this, don‚Äôt judge me too quick. Just listen. Maybe you‚Äôll know what it means. Maybe you‚Äôll tell me how to stop hearing the walls.

It started when my dad died last fall. October 17, 2024, to be exact‚Äîtwo days after my 29th birthday. Lung cancer took him fast, a chain-smoker‚Äôs grim finale. He was 63, wiry and gray, with hands like sandpaper from decades swinging hammers. He‚Äôd been a carpenter, the kind who could turn a pile of splintered oak into a dining table you‚Äôd swear was art. His last call came from hospice, voice raspy over the crackling line: ‚ÄúJenna, the house is yours. Don‚Äôt sell it blind‚Äîcheck it first.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much of it then. He‚Äôd built that place himself, a squat two-story cabin on 12 acres north of Saranac Lake, New York, tucked in the Adirondacks where the pines choke out the sun. I figured he meant termites or a leaky roof. I was wrong.

I drove up three weeks later, November 8, a Friday. The air was sharp, smelling of wet leaves and frost, the kind that stings your nose and fogs your breath. My old Subaru crunched over the gravel drive, headlights slicing through the dusk to catch the house crouched against a wall of trees. It looked smaller than I remembered‚Äîsagging porch, cedar siding weathered to a dull gray, windows like dark eyes smudged with grime. The chimney puffed lazy smoke; I‚Äôd paid a neighbor, old Mr. Gentry, to light the woodstove before I got there. Inside, the place was a time capsule: plaid couch with cigarette burns, a rotary phone on the wall, Dad‚Äôs toolbox by the hearth‚Äîrusted pliers, a claw hammer, nails scattered like teeth. The air hung heavy with dust and the faint tang of mildew, the floorboards groaning under my boots.

I dropped my duffel by the stairs‚Äînarrow, steep, carpeted in faded maroon‚Äîand started a fire. The logs snapped, spitting embers that danced up the flue, casting jittery shadows on the pine-paneled walls. I‚Äôd brought a thermos of coffee, black and bitter, and poured it into one of Dad‚Äôs chipped mugs, the one with ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Okayest Carpenter‚Äù in peeling letters. That‚Äôs when I noticed the hum. Low, steady, like a fridge compressor but deeper, vibrating in my chest. I checked the kitchen‚Äîempty fridge, unplugged‚Äîthen the basement door, a slab of unpainted oak by the pantry. The hum pulsed louder there, seeping through the wood. I jiggled the knob; locked. Dad never locked it when I was a kid. I shrugged it off, too tired to hunt for a key, and crashed on the couch, the fire‚Äôs crackle lulling me under.

I woke to scratching. Not loud‚Äîsoft, deliberate, like fingernails on drywall. My eyes snapped open, the room dim, fire down to glowing coals. The digital clock on the mantle blinked 3:14 a.m., its red digits fuzzy in the dark. The scratching came from upstairs, a slow drag, then a pause, then again‚Äîscritch, scritch, stop. I sat up, blanket slipping to the floor, my breath shallow and quick. The house was old, sure‚Äîmice, wind, settling beams‚Äîbut this felt wrong, too rhythmic. I grabbed the fireplace poker, cold iron biting my palm, and crept to the stairs. The maroon carpet muffled my steps, but each creak of the wood underneath spiked my pulse. The air grew colder as I climbed, a draft licking my bare arms, smelling faintly of damp earth and something sour, like spoiled milk.

At the top, a hallway stretched left and right, five doors total: three bedrooms, a bathroom, and a closet. The scratching came from Dad‚Äôs room, second on the right. The door was ajar, hinges squeaking as I nudged it open with the poker‚Äôs tip. Moonlight spilled through the single window, its frame warped, glass streaked with years of rain. The room was sparse‚Äîtwin bed with a sagging mattress, a dresser topped with a cracked mirror, a rug frayed to threads. The scratching stopped the second I crossed the threshold, silence so thick it pressed on my ears. Then I saw it: the wall by the bed. A patch of plaster, maybe two feet wide, was scored with thin, jagged lines‚Äîdozens of them, crisscrossing like a kid‚Äôs chaotic sketch. They weren‚Äôt there last time I‚Äôd visited, two years back. I touched one, tracing the groove; it was deep, fresh, plaster dust crumbling under my fingertip.

A thud jolted me‚Äîheavy, deliberate, from below. I spun, poker raised, heart hammering against my ribs. The hum was back, louder, rolling up through the floorboards like a growl. I bolted downstairs, boots slipping on the last step, and froze. The basement door stood wide open, a black rectangle exhaling cold, musty air. The lock dangled, broken, its screws glinting on the floor. I hadn‚Äôt touched it. I edged closer, poker trembling in my grip, and peered down. A wooden staircase descended into shadow, each step warped and splintered, the hum now a steady drone that buzzed in my skull.

I should‚Äôve left. Every nerve screamed to grab my keys and run, but Dad‚Äôs voice echoed‚Äî‚ÄúCheck it first.‚Äù I flicked the light switch by the door; nothing. My phone‚Äôs flashlight cut a thin beam, catching cobwebs and dust motes as I took the first step. The wood sagged under my weight, creaking like a warning. The air thickened as I went‚Äîdamp, metallic, with that sour edge stronger now, sticking in my throat. At the bottom, the basement sprawled, a concrete box lit only by my shaking light. Shelves lined one wall, stuffed with mason jars‚Äîcloudy, unlabeled, their contents sloshing as I passed. A workbench sat opposite, strewn with tools: a handsaw, chisels, a mallet crusted with something dark. The hum pulsed from the far corner, where a tarp draped over a lumpy shape, stained and frayed at the edges.

I yanked the tarp back. Underneath was a wooden hatch, crude and uneven, nailed into the concrete with thick, rusted spikes. The hum poured from it, vibrating the floor, and with it came a sound‚Äîlow, wet, like someone sucking air through a clogged straw. My stomach twisted. I pried at the hatch with the poker, nails screeching as they gave. The wood lifted, revealing a hole‚Äîrough, hand-dug, maybe three feet wide, dropping into blackness. The smell hit me hard‚Äîrot, copper, and that sour milk stench, so thick I gagged. My light caught something down there: a glint, then movement‚Äîa slow, jerking shift, like a limb flexing.

I stumbled back, dropping the poker with a clang. The hum spiked, a deafening roar, and the walls‚ÄîGod, the walls‚Äîstarted to breathe. The pine panels flexed, bulging out then sucking in, splintering at the seams. Dust rained from the ceiling, and that wet sound grew‚Äîgurgling, gasping, closer. I scrambled upstairs, slamming the basement door, and jammed the couch against it. The whole house shook, windows rattling, the floor bucking like a living thing. I grabbed my duffel, keys jangling, and ran for the car. The Subaru roared to life, tires spinning gravel as I floored it, the cabin shrinking in the rearview. But I heard it‚Äîone last time, clear as a bell through the chaos: ‚ÄúJenna.‚Äù My name, rasped from the dark.

I‚Äôve been back in Albany since, 200 miles south, but it‚Äôs not far enough. The hum followed me. It‚Äôs faint at first‚Äînights only, seeping from my apartment walls. I‚Äôve checked the studs, the pipes, even tore out drywall‚Äînothing. My neighbor, Mrs. Platt, bangs on the ceiling when it gets loud, her broom thumping like a judge‚Äôs gavel. Last week, I woke to scratches on my bedroom wall‚Äîthin, jagged, just like Dad‚Äôs room. The mirror fogged up yesterday, no steam, no heat, and something pressed against it: a handprint, too big, fingers splayed and webbed. I smashed it, glass slicing my knuckles, blood dripping on the carpet.

Last night was worse. The hum turned to words‚Äîmine, warped and slow, like a tape played backward. ‚ÄúJenna‚Ä¶ come‚Ä¶ back‚Ä¶‚Äù I recorded it, phone trembling, and played it for my friend Mark. He heard static, nothing else. I hear it clear as day. The walls here flex now, just a twitch, but it‚Äôs growing. My landlord‚Äôs coming tomorrow‚Äîeviction notice pinned to my door, yellow paper curling at the edges. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm going back to the cabin tonight. Not to stay‚Äîto burn it. Gasoline‚Äôs in my trunk, matches in my pocket. Dad built that house, but something‚Äôs in it, something he locked away‚Äîor fed. If I don‚Äôt stop it, it‚Äôll keep coming.

If you‚Äôve seen this‚Äîheard it‚Äîtell me. What did he build down there? What‚Äôs calling me? I‚Äôll check this post before I go, signal permitting. If I don‚Äôt reply‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt come looking.

I am shy so I wasn't able to get to her seat and introduce myself next to her colleagues, we work in different teams. Then I decided to send her a message on Microsoft Teams, on which she is always offline, she usually uses Slack.

In this message I said I was sorry for using Teams, but I didn't want to embarass her in front of everybody. I asked her for a coffee together, or eventually to exchange contacts to talk from time to time. I asked her to let me know, and said thanks for her time.

I sent this message today, she read it but I didn't get any answer.

I would like to know if it's legit to wait for another day or two, or should I declare this as a rejection.

One strange thing was that I have her pinned on top and I can see her states. She's basically every day offline, but today she was always green, online.

I'm an international student doing a Masters in Creative Writing in London. Lately I've been losing motivation and I'm afraid I'm not good enough for my chosen degree. 

I wish I could've studied this back home, but there are no degrees like this one there. I did think I could come to the UK (a place I had visited before and enjoyed) and live the dream of studying something I loved. However, I've been losing motivation and I wonder if it was all a stupid decision. So far, my grades have been 58, 62, 62, 72. 

I try to be compassionate with myself because I'm doing everything in a foreign language, and I know my writing isn't as good in English as it is in my native language. But still, I can't help but feel frustrated at times... I thought I could do so much better at everything, but it feels like living takes double the effort (always thinking and speaking another language, missing home, trying to keep up with London's quick lifestyle, being away from friends and family...such and such). I've tried to enjoy life in the city and go to the theater, concerts, dinners and coffees by myself, go out with my flatmates; and it all has  been great, but I can't help but feel foreign and unwelcomed. I'm always double-checking everything I write, everything I say, and at the end of the day I don't feel like being myself (and still make mistakes, lol). 

I understand people's (lecturers and people in general) demands on speaking English as best as possible, but I'm human‚Äîand I don't even think my English is that bad, tbh, I'm just not a very talkative person and my grammar may not be Dickens, but it's good still. I've had some experiences that have been a blown to my confidence, and a lot of people have told me to go back home (which I don't know if it's them being lighthearted or racist). It's been tiring. 

I will work harder for this term's modules so I can get better grades, but honestly, right now I just hope this ends so I can go back home (no one will even care if I get a first or second or whatever). 

I am doing therapy online because it's been rough, but I'd like to hear any advice from students on how to get motivated once again. What do you do when it all gets too overwhelming or when imposter syndrome kicks in? I've been trying to convince myself that they could've rejected me when I applied to universities, but they didn't... so I might be at least something at writing. How do you deal with alienation? And with feeling like all this isn't worth it?

We start going back and forth and I‚Äôm like why can‚Äôt you just tell me what you want ???! I don‚Äôt want to have to guess this time . I‚Äôm too indecisive myself and I don‚Äôt want to overthink because it‚Äôs easy for me to do that . He‚Äôs saying it doesn‚Äôt matter over and over so I‚Äôm like if it doesn‚Äôt matter then just throw something out there why do I have to be like the randomizer, slot machine right now and matter fact he‚Äôs heard me say often ‚Äúcan you tell me exactly what you want so I don‚Äôt have to guess‚Äù iso I‚Äôm just not hitting him with this mentality out the blue and it‚Äôs like pulling teeth for him to just tell me .

I say we‚Äôre on the phone we can clearly communicate this . He hangs up on me and tells me how he doesn‚Äôt see a future with me that I‚Äôm not playing my part that THIS is what he‚Äôs talking about , not being his peace . And this ‚Äútrivial bullshit‚Äù he never had to deal with in his past relationships . I‚Äôm being a bitch and he doesn‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm on my period And I‚Äôm thinking did I really blow this up ? I‚Äôm hurt by his response because this is one of many time he reaches this extreme on something that I agree is trivial . I did have intentions of just getting something anyways despite the back and forth but since he sent that text I just didn‚Äôt bother . ",1,1740432886.0,AmItheAsshole,8,1.0,False

I was a pint and a half drinker of vodka 5-6 days out of the week for the last 2 years. My ALT sky rocketed fast going from seemingly 50-60 to now 250-300 as of the last 6 months.. I quit drinking 3 months ago and my ALT literally hasn‚Äôt moved. It went from 250 to basically 210.. In 3 whole months.. I‚Äôm discouraged because I see others on here majority have their ALT go down drastically in one month, some even weeks after the quit.. I eat extremely clean, exercise daily, no drugs, don‚Äôt smoke, no soda. Basically morning coffee, then water all day.. Doc has me scheduled for ultrasound next month but has anyone else experienced this ? My AST is much lower, it‚Äôs usually 75-150 tops.. ALP is also perfectly within range has never been elevated.. Why is my ALT being SO stubborn to me.. ",1,1740432827.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False
1ixdo2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationalThoughts/comments/1ixdo2s/my_deep_thoughts_about_life_continued/,My Deep Thoughts About Life continued,"The body knows all this stuff naturally and instinctively. It‚Äôs the analytical mind that so often forgets these basic truths. The body exists in a constant state of flow, always adapting, always responding with intelligence to what each moment presents. It‚Äôs only our thoughts and concepts that create this persistent illusion of solidity, of permanence, of separation from the whole. I‚Äôve been practicing awareness of this in small everyday activities. Like when I‚Äôm walking, consciously feeling how each step naturally flows into the next in perfect harmony. Or when I‚Äôm preparing food, noticing with fascination how ingredients transform and combine to become something entirely new and hopefully delicious.
I‚Äôve been contemplating the nature of resistance a lot lately, examining how much precious life energy we waste fighting against what simply is. Like this one morning, I found myself stuck in traffic, and I could feel that all-too-familiar tension rising in my body like a tidal wave. But then, in a moment of clarity, I remembered: this too is simply part of life‚Äôs eternal flow. Instead of resisting this reality, I made a conscious choice to sink deeply into the present moment. Used this unexpected pause to truly listen to the music playing through my speakers, to observe with fascination the intricate play of morning light on the cars ahead, to notice my own breath moving in and out. It‚Äôs truly remarkable how differently the exact same external situation feels when you stop exhausting yourself by fighting against reality.
The really mind-bending aspect of all this is contemplating the mysterious nature of time itself. Time is often spoken of as if the past, present, and future are distinct and concrete. But in reality, only the present moment truly exists. The past is nothing more than memory fragments stored in your mind, recalled only in the now. The future is merely imagination possibilities and projections that exist only as thoughts in this moment. Everything you have ever experienced, everything you ever will, happens only in the now. Each moment is a funeral. Everything that exists right now this thought, this breath, this feeling is already slipping away. Even as I acknowledge it, it‚Äôs gone, replaced by something new. The past moment has died, never to return, and in its place, a fresh reality is being born. This is not just poetic philosophy; it‚Äôs the very structure of existence. Life doesn‚Äôt move through time it is time, unfolding moment by moment, with each passing instant vanishing into oblivion, making way for what comes next.
And yet, despite this constant renewal, we cling. We act as though we can hold on to something solid, as though life were a still painting rather than a river in motion. But if we look closely, we see that everything we experience is in a state of continuous death and rebirth.
Take a breath. Hold it. Now exhale.
The breath you just took will never exist again. It is gone, dissipated into the air. That inhale was a birth, the filling of the lungs, the taking in of life. The exhale was its death, the release, the letting go. And yet, without that exhale, no new inhale could follow. This cycle inhale, exhale, birth, death is happening constantly, sustaining life itself.
If we zoom in further, we see the same truth playing out within us. Billions of cells in our bodies are dying and being replaced each second. By the time I finish writing this sentence, countless skin cells have flaked away, neurons have fired and dimmed, blood cells have lived and perished. Every part of me that existed just moments ago has already changed. I am not the same person who began this thought.
But if that‚Äôs the case, who am I?
We like to think of ourselves as continuous beings, as though I am the same person today that I was yesterday, last year, ten years ago. But am I?
The child I once was, he‚Äôs dead now. The teenager who once obsessed over trivial worries that person is gone too. Even the me from an hour ago is only a memory. We do not notice this because the transition is seamless. One version of the self dies, and another takes its place so fluidly that we mistake this for permanence. But permanence is an illusion. We are shifting sand, rearranged with each passing second by the tide of time.
And yet, this death of the old self is not a tragedy it is necessary. If we never changed, we would be trapped, frozen in place, unable to grow. Just as a tree must shed its leaves to make room for new growth, just as a snake must shed its skin, we must continually let parts of ourselves die so that something new can emerge.
As each moment dies, where does the next one come from? If time is a fire, consuming everything in its path, then the future is the fuel. Each second is a sacrifice the present must be burned away so that the future can exist.
But here‚Äôs the catch, the future never actually arrives. We think of it as something distant, waiting ahead of us, but in reality, it is always appearing right now. The moment something becomes real, it ceases to be the future and transforms into the present, only to be immediately swallowed by the past. The future is not a fixed destination it is an endless procession of emerging moments, arriving only to disappear.
It‚Äôs strange to think that the things I will experience tomorrow are currently nothing more than unformed potential. The people I will meet, the thoughts I will have, the emotions that will rise within me they do not exist yet. They are waiting in the vast, unknowable void of the future, just as this moment was waiting before it arrived.
This means that, in a way, we are always walking on the edge of nonexistence. The present moment is the only sliver of reality that is ever truly real everything else is either memory or anticipation.
This cycle of death and rebirth is not just present in our thoughts or our breath it is everywhere. The seasons demonstrate it perfectly.
Spring is birth, flowers bloom, animals emerge, everything awakens.
Summer is life in full expression, the peak of existence.
Fall is the slow decay, the preparation for death. 
Winter is the end, the stillness, the quiet death before the cycle begins again.
Every year, the trees shed their leaves, and we mourn the loss of green, but the trees do not mourn. They understand that death is not an end but a necessary transition. Without winter, there can be no spring. Without decay, there can be no renewal.
This truth is reflected even in the stars. Every atom in our bodies was forged in the heart of a dying star billions of years ago. A star had to burn itself out, had to collapse and explode, so that its elements could scatter through the cosmos and one day form the matter that makes up you and me. If that star had clung to its existence, resisting its inevitable end, we would not be here.
This means that our existence is literally built upon past deaths. We are walking memorials to everything that has ever lived and died before us.
What does this mean for how we live?
For one, it means we don‚Äôt have to be afraid of endings. Endings are unavoidable, but they are also beginnings in disguise. Relationships change, jobs come and go, friendships fade, our interests evolve none of this is a failure. It is simply the rhythm of existence.
This also means that we must fully embrace this moment, because once it‚Äôs gone, it will never return. Not in the same form. If I am sitting with a friend, sharing a deep conversation, I can remind myself that this exact moment will never happen again. This version of us will never exist again in precisely the same way. And so, I must be fully present, fully alive to it, before it slips into the past forever.
It also means we can learn to flow with change rather than resist it. If I accept that everything is constantly shifting, I don‚Äôt have to grip so tightly to things that are meant to pass. I can let go of old identities, old fears, old attachments, trusting that whatever comes next is simply the next version of the now unfolding.
So here we are, caught in this endless dance of emergence and dissolution. The past dissolves, the future forms, and the present is the razor-thin edge where they meet.
But here‚Äôs the real mystery who is the witness to all of this?
Something in me remains aware as all these moments die and are reborn. I watch my thoughts fade, my emotions rise and fall, my body change over time. And yet, there is an unchanging presence within me that simply observes. This presence is not affected by time, because it is not a thing that exists in time it is the awareness in which time unfolds.
Perhaps this awareness is what some call the soul. Perhaps it is consciousness itself. Whatever it is, it is not bound by the cycle of birth and death, because it is the stage upon which this entire drama plays out.
We are not just the fleeting moments of our lives. We are not just the changing self that constantly dissolves and reforms. We are the awareness in which all of it happens. We are not just the river we are the space through which it flows.
And if that‚Äôs true, then death is not something to be feared. It is simply the next wave rising, the next inhale following the exhale, the next moment appearing from the endless well of the future. Instead of seeing it as this final, terrible ending to be feared and avoided, I‚Äôm beginning to recognize it as an integral part of the natural flow of existence. Everything in the natural world moves through these endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The seasons, the cycles of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun, why should human consciousness be any different? Perhaps what we typically call death is simply another form of transformation, another turning in this infinite cosmic dance that never truly begins or ends.
Nothing is ever truly lost. It only changes form. It only flows. Time, then, may not be a fixed reality but rather a construct of the mind, a way we try to make sense of the ever-flowing present. Einstein revolutionized our understanding by showing that time itself is relative, right? And when you really sink into this state of flow, this dimension we call time seems to, shift and bend in fascinating ways. Sometimes an hour can feel like a mere breath, sometimes a single minute feels like an eternity. Perhaps time itself is just another aspect of this grand cosmic dance of perpetual change and transformation. And just as time isn‚Äôt as fixed as we think, neither is our sense of self. The story we tell ourselves about who we are isn‚Äôt just something we passively remember it‚Äôs something we are actively revising.
I think of my consciousness as both the author and the reader of an autobiography that‚Äôs being continuously rewritten. My brain doesn‚Äôt just add new chapters it subtly revises old ones to keep the story of me coherent. Every major decision I make, whether it‚Äôs changing paths, rethinking old assumptions, or taking a risk I never thought I would, isn‚Äôt just shaping my future it‚Äôs reshaping my past, too.
When I make a decision that feels out of character, it doesn‚Äôt just stand alone it rewrites the way I see myself. If I‚Äôve always thought of myself as cautious but then I take a big risk and succeed, that moment doesn‚Äôt just sit there in isolation. It forces me to reinterpret my past. Suddenly, I can recall times when I was braver than I gave myself credit for. My whole self-narrative shifts.
It‚Äôs like standing in a room full of mirrors where every reflection subtly changes each time I make a choice. I‚Äôm not just shaping who I‚Äôll become I‚Äôm changing who I remember being. That‚Äôs why growth can feel both gradual and sudden. Day to day, the changes are too small to notice, but every now and then, I get a moment of clarity and realize just how much my self-story has transformed.
The trick is catching the editing process in real time. I try to pay attention to how I explain my actions to myself. Am I forcing things to fit an old narrative by telling myself  ‚ÄúI always mess up‚Äù Or am I letting the story evolve by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning‚Äù? Just like a river naturally carves its own path, my self-story flows more smoothly when I stop gripping so tightly to who I think I‚Äôm supposed to be.
I can start noticing the small shifts already happening how my preferences change, how my reactions evolve, how my understanding deepens. These aren‚Äôt deviations from who I am, they‚Äôre natural expressions of growth. Like a plant turning toward the light, I‚Äôm always adjusting toward what nurtures me.
The less I resist these shifts, the more I can work with them instead of against them. And maybe I‚Äôve been becoming more extroverted lately. Instead of forcing myself back into old habits, avoiding interactions,  what if I explored what this shift is teaching me about my needs right now?
My story isn‚Äôt set in stone. It never was. I‚Äôm letting it unfold. I‚Äôm choosing the smoother path.
The more I think about it, the more I realize that reality isn‚Äôt something we simply witness it‚Äôs something we actively construct. Every moment, our minds aren‚Äôt just processing information, they‚Äôre filtering, interpreting, and filling in the gaps to create a seamless experience of the world. But is that world really as solid and objective as it seems?
It‚Äôs strange to consider, but what I see, hear, and feel isn‚Äôt the full picture it‚Äôs just my brain‚Äôs best guess. Our senses can only perceive in a range that is less than the total. Our eyes cannot see infrared or ultraviolet light. The mind is like an artist sketching reality in real time, blending past experiences, cultural conditioning, subconscious biases, and limited sensory input, into a version of the world that feels stable. But the moment you step outside that automatic perception, everything shifts.
Like that one time I came across a photo of an old street in a city I had never visited, yet it felt strangely familiar. My brain had pieced together fragments of memories, similar textures, and past experiences to create an illusion of recognition. But it wasn‚Äôt the place I knew it was the feeling of familiarity that tricked me.
And if something as simple as a photograph can distort my sense of reality, what else am I misperceiving? What other invisible forces shape the way I interpret life, people, or even myself? Maybe the world isn‚Äôt as fixed as we assume. Maybe shifting perception learning to see differently is one of the most powerful ways to experience reality more fully.

I‚Äôve been thinking about the difference between knowing and understanding. The way the mind grasps at understanding, trying to label, analyze, and categorize everything into something manageable, something explainable. But then there‚Äôs something else, something deeper. A kind of knowing that doesn‚Äôt require words, doesn‚Äôt demand proof, doesn‚Äôt wait for permission.
Intuition, instinct, the raw, unfiltered pulse of awareness that moves through me before the thought even arrives.
I‚Äôve spent so much time thinking, deconstructing, trying to grasp the mechanics of existence, but I‚Äôm starting to notice something strange. Some of the most profound realizations don‚Äôt come from deliberate thought at all. They arrive fully formed, like whispers from somewhere deeper than the conscious mind. A wordless recognition, a shift in perception that feels as natural as breathing. It‚Äôs not something I figure out it‚Äôs something I feel.
And the more I pay attention, the more I realize that some of the best decisions I‚Äôve made weren‚Äôt logical at all. They weren‚Äôt carefully planned or reasoned out. They just, felt right. Like the moment knew itself before I did, like my body was already moving toward something my mind hadn‚Äôt caught up to yet.
I used to resist this. I wanted proof, explanations, reasons. I wanted my understanding to be solid, backed by logic, defensible against scrutiny. But intuition doesn‚Äôt work that way. It doesn‚Äôt explain itself. It simply is and when I let it in, when I stop second-guessing and just allow myself to trust it. I find that it often knows more than my intellect ever could.
Then that raises the question where‚Äôs the balance?
Because I can‚Äôt ignore awareness either. The mind‚Äôs ability to question, to observe, to analyze, it‚Äôs valuable, essential, without it, intuition can slip into unchecked assumption, blind impulse. Just because something feels right doesn‚Äôt mean it is. The body has wisdom, but it also carries fear, conditioning, old habits disguised as instinct. Not everything that arises from within is truth, sometimes it‚Äôs just noise.

So how do I tell the difference?
I‚Äôve been experimenting with this, trying to listen more closely to both sides to the quiet knowing beneath thought and to the clarity of conscious awareness and I‚Äôve noticed something. Intuition speaks first, but awareness refines.
Intuition arrives like a flash, a pull in a certain direction, a sense of yes or no before I can even articulate why. It‚Äôs fast, instinctive. But awareness is slower it steps in afterward, examines, cross-checks, asks, Is this real knowing, or is it reaction?

And the difference, I think, is in the feeling of it. True intuition feels still. There‚Äôs no urgency, no desperation. It doesn‚Äôt clamor for attention it simply sits there, quiet and steady, waiting to be noticed. Fear, impulse, and habit, on the other hand, feel loud. They push, they demand, they create tension. When I act from fear disguised as instinct, there‚Äôs always a kind of tightness, a need to rush. But real intuition? It has patience. It doesn‚Äôt force it guides.
This realization has changed the way I move through the world. When something arises in me a gut feeling, a sudden clarity I sit with it. I let it breathe. If it‚Äôs real, it doesn‚Äôt fade under scrutiny. If it‚Äôs false, it‚Äôs just reaction masquerading as wisdom, it loses power the moment I bring awareness to it.
It‚Äôs like watching the night sky. At first, you only see the brightest stars, the ones that demand your attention. But if you let your eyes adjust, if you soften your focus, a whole field of subtler stars emerges ones that were there all along but needed stillness to be seen. That‚Äôs what intuition feels like. It‚Äôs always there, beneath the noise, waiting for me to be quiet enough to hear it.
And I think this balance this dance between instinct and awareness isn‚Äôt just about decision making. It‚Äôs in everything.

It‚Äôs in the way I write, the way words find their way onto the screen before I fully understand them. When I overthink, when I try to force meaning, the writing stiffens. It loses something, its movement, its natural rhythm. But when I let intuition lead, when I let the words spill out before my mind catches up, there‚Äôs a kind of effortless flow. And then later, awareness steps in, not to constrain, but to refine, to dot the t‚Äôs and cross the i‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not about controlling the creative process, but about listening to it, learning when to trust the first instinct and when to step back and shape it into something clearer.
It‚Äôs in the way I interact with others, too. Some conversations require careful thought, a deliberate choosing of words. But other times, the best moments happen when I stop filtering, stop trying to control, and just let the natural rhythm of connection unfold. When I tune into the energy of a moment instead of overanalyzing it.

Even in something as simple as movement, walking, exercising, stretching, the body knows things the mind doesn‚Äôt. When I move with awareness, I notice how my body naturally adjusts, how it finds balance on its own if I let it. When I force it, when I overthink the mechanics, it becomes stiff, unnatural.
Everything flows better when I let instinct and awareness work together.

That seems to be the key. Not choosing one over the other, but learning when to step back and when to step in. When to trust the feeling that arises before thought, and when to bring thought in to shape that feeling into something clearer.
Maybe intuition is the river, and awareness is the banks that guide its movement.
Maybe awareness is the sky, and intuition is the wind that moves through it. Real wisdom isn‚Äôt about knowing with the mind or the gut alone, but about listening to both, learning their rhythms, knowing when to let go and when to hold steady. The moments when I feel most alive are the moments when I stop trying to force a choice between the two, when I stop separating thought from feeling, mind from instinct, awareness from intuition, and simply let myself be in the flow of it all.

It continues to amaze me that the more fully I embrace this natural flow of life, the more I notice how things just‚Ä¶ work themselves out in often unexpected ways. Not always according to my limited personal preferences or expectations, but they invariably work out in ways that serve growth and evolution. It‚Äôs as if the universe itself possesses its own intelligence, its own organic way of unfolding. When I stubbornly try to force reality into conforming with my limited vision and understanding, I create suffering for myself. But when I trust in this universe, that‚Äôs when life reveals its magic in surprising ways.
There‚Äôs something particularly fascinating about the creative process too, how inspiration flows with effortless grace when you manage to get your analytical mind out of the way. I was carving a stone one day, and for quite a while, I was stuck in my head about it, trying too hard to make it, good, according to some imagined standard. But then something magical shifted in my awareness, and suddenly it wasn‚Äôt me doing the carving anymore in any conventional sense. It was as if the stone itself was gradually revealing its form through my hands. I completely lost track of time in that state of pure flow. Came back to normal awareness hours later with dust covering my hands and this profound sense of having been part of something far greater than my individual self.
Through direct experience, I‚Äôm learning that true surrender isn‚Äôt passive or weak at all as some might think. It‚Äôs actually this moment by moment conscious choice to step courageously into the unknown and trust that the universe has a greater wisdom than our limited minds can comprehend. It‚Äôs about releasing our desperate need for control and opening ourselves fully to what is, rather than remaining caught in our ideas about what we think should be. Much easier to talk about than to actually live, though, isn‚Äôt it?
Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about gratitude in a way I never have before. Not as a feel good practice or a polite acknowledgment of the good things in life, but as something deeper. Something existential.
Most of us cling to life like it‚Äôs a solid, permanent thing. But it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs fragile, fleeting, always in motion, always changing. And yet, that‚Äôs precisely what makes it beautiful.
I used to fear impermanence, but now I see it as a gift. If nothing lasts forever, then every moment, every laugh, every breath, every quiet sunrise, matters more, not less. It‚Äôs the temporary nature of things that makes them precious.
There was a time when I saw gratitude as something tied to specific events. A good day, a kind gesture, a moment of success. But now, I see it differently. Gratitude isn‚Äôt about holding onto what is, it‚Äôs about appreciating what was while letting it go. It‚Äôs about looking at the constant unfolding of life and saying, Yes. Even this. Even the hard parts. Even the uncertainty.
Because the truth is, we don‚Äôt get to keep anything. Not moments, not people, not even ourselves in the way we are right now. But we do get to experience them. And maybe that‚Äôs enough.
The ancient wisdom traditions understood these profound truths at a deep level. That‚Äôs precisely why they chose to call it uni-verse. One turning. One change. One eternal moment of perpetual transformation. 
There‚Äôs something profoundly liberating about embracing this deeper understanding of reality. I don‚Äôt have to carry the impossible burden of having everything figured out. I don‚Äôt need to know with certainty where all of this is ultimately going. My role isn‚Äôt to somehow direct or control the river of life, it‚Äôs to learn to swim with it gracefully, to trust its ancient wisdom, to allow it to carry me exactly where I need to go for my highest evolution.
And the synchronicities, they seem to multiply once you start paying attention with awareness. Those remarkable moments of perfect timing, those seemingly random coincidences that feel more like gentle whispers from the universe itself. Like yesterday‚Äôs experience, when exactly the book I needed somehow found its way into my hands at precisely the right moment. These aren‚Äôt mere chance occurrences but rather confirmations of our deeper connection to the whole.
I‚Äôve been practicing this approach where instead of forcefully trying to implement changes in my life according to some mental plan, I attempt to align myself more naturally with the changes that are already wanting to happen through me. It‚Äôs similar to, that experience when you‚Äôre swimming in the ocean, and you can either exhaust yourself fighting against the powerful waves or learn to move in harmony with them. When you resist and fight, you quickly become depleted. But when you learn to move with their natural rhythm, there‚Äôs this, effortless grace that emerges naturally.
I‚Äôve been consciously applying this understanding to my work as well. Instead of forcing myself to push through periods of natural resistance, I‚Äôm learning to notice and honor the times when I‚Äôm naturally energized and aligned with the flow of creativity and productivity. When I work with these natural rhythms rather than against them, I find that not only does the quality of my work improve dramatically, but the entire experience becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. Sometimes this means working intensely during periods of natural inspiration, while other times it means allowing myself to rest and recharge when my energy naturally ebbs.
Perhaps this is what all the great spiritual teachers throughout history have been trying to help us understand. That we‚Äôre not actually separate from this vast flow of existence as we so often believe. We‚Äôre not isolated islands standing alone in the middle of a flowing river of life. We ARE the river itself in human form. The flow isn‚Äôt some external force we need to somehow tap into or connect with, it‚Äôs what we fundamentally are at our deepest level of being. Our very essence is this flow, this dance, this eternal movement of life expressing itself through temporary forms.
I‚Äôm gradually learning to say yes to all of it, to embrace the totality of human experience. The moments of transcendent joy and the periods of deep pain. The times of effortless ease and the challenges that stretch us beyond our comfort zones. The beautiful blossoming of growth and the necessary decay that makes new life possible. Because it's all one seamless movement, isn‚Äôt it? One vast, beautiful, terrible, magnificent flow of being expressing itself in infinite ways. And I‚Äôm not separate from any of it. I never was. I never could be. This understanding brings both profound responsibility and incredible freedom.
Sometimes the most profound and transformative truths are also the simplest and most obvious once we have eyes to see them. Like this morning, I was simply sitting with my steaming cup of coffee, watching with fascination as the delicate wisps of steam rose and spiraled in the crisp morning air. And suddenly it hit me with the force of revelation, that‚Äôs me too. That‚Äôs all of us. Rising, spiraling, dissolving, becoming something new in each moment. Over and over and over again in this eternal dance of transformation. The steam wasn‚Äôt just showing me its nature, but revealing my own nature to me in that moment of clarity.
Maybe that‚Äôs the greatest gift of this deepening understanding, this profound sense of belonging to something far greater than ourselves. Of being an integral part of something so vast and incomprehensibly beautiful that my limited human mind can‚Äôt fully grasp or contain it. But the beautiful truth is that I don‚Äôt need to intellectually comprehend it all. I just need to flow with it, trust it, allow it to move through me and as me in each moment. My role is to be a conscious participant in this grand dance of existence.
Sometimes I find myself questioning whether I‚Äôm going a bit crazy thinking about all of this stuff. Like, who really spends their time contemplating the profound nature of change and the vast mysteries of the universe? But then again, maybe that‚Äôs exactly what we as conscious beings should be thinking about. Maybe all our seemingly important daily dramas and concerns are just, tiny ripples on the surface of something infinitely deeper and more meaningful than we typically realize.
In moments of quiet contemplation, I find myself imagining my existence as an inseparable part of this vast, endless cosmic dance. Countless stars being born and dying in spectacular supernovas, entire galaxies spinning in their celestial ballet, planets tracing their eternal orbits through the void, and here I am, a brief but conscious flicker of awareness in this infinite flow of existence. But even in my brevity, I‚Äôm fundamentally connected to the whole. Even in my apparent smallness, I‚Äôm woven into the fabric of all that is. My very atoms were forged in the hearts of ancient stars, and they will one day become part of something entirely new.
And so here I sit, allowing these thoughts to flow through my awareness like water moving through a stream bed. Each moment entirely unique and different from the last. Each breath marking a new beginning in this eternal now. Each heartbeat serving as a reminder that I am alive, I am changing, I am the change itself expressing through this particular form. The universe isn‚Äôt something out there, separate from who and what I am. It‚Äôs what I am in my deepest essence. What we all are at our core. One vast, eternal moment of transformation, expressing itself in infinite ways through all forms and phenomena.
One verse. One change. One eternal dance of being. And I am dancing it, whether I remember this truth in each moment or not. We all are, every single one of us. Maybe that‚Äôs enough. Maybe that‚Äôs absolutely everything. Maybe in that simple understanding lies the key to living with both grace and purpose in this magnificent mystery we call life.

1ixdkf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationalThoughts/comments/1ixdkf3/my_deep_thoughts_about_life/,My Deep Thoughts About Life,"My Deep Thoughts About Life. 
I have this unrelenting drive to understand things, to grasp what makes them tick. Whether it‚Äôs the way people think, act, feel, or my environment, I‚Äôm always seeking to understand the world around me. But the more I try to understand, the more I feel like I‚Äôm misunderstood. It‚Äôs as though I‚Äôm on a different wavelength, one that others can‚Äôt quite tune into, even when I try my best to explain. My perspective is unique, shaped by experiences and ways of thinking that differ from what others might expect or comprehend.
This drive to understand isn‚Äôt about fixing anything or changing the way things are, it‚Äôs about seeing the nuances and complexities that others might miss. Really I‚Äôm just a guy who likes to think a lot, and is very observant. Not in a way that makes me any wiser or smarter than anyone else. Just in a way that makes me, well, me. My mind constantly wanders and drifts toward the big questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of consciousness. What is the nature of reality? What does it mean to be truly alive? I don‚Äôt claim to have the answers, but I find deep joy in exploring these eternal mysteries. I‚Äôve found myself researching, physics, cosmology, philosophy, etymology, spirituality, ancient cultures, and psychology in my attempt to understand everything. I am not an expert in any of these, but I think I understand them a little. 
I truly enjoy exploring these topics and letting my thoughts wonder through these subjects. I‚Äôve found that the more I sit with these thoughts, the more I realize how little control we actually have over the grand tapestry of existence and how incredibly freeing that realization can be. 
Life is perpetual movement, constant change, endless transformation. It‚Äôs like a river that keeps flowing, whether we choose to fight against its current or learn to swim harmoniously with it. So, this is me, thinking out loud, letting the thoughts take shape as they naturally emerge from the depths of consciousness. I‚Äôm not seeking grand conclusions or absolute certainty, just embracing curiosity, cultivating presence, and maintaining a willingness to see where the mysterious flow of existence leads.

Universe, one turning, one change. That‚Äôs what it means, doesn‚Äôt it? This has been occupying my thoughts lately with increasing frequency. The way everything is just, flowing. Moving. Transforming. Even as I sit here trying to pin down these thoughts, countless cells in my body are dying and being reborn in an endless dance of renewal. Nothing in this vast cosmos stays still for even a moment.

I‚Äôve been deeply immersing myself in this subject lately, fascinated by how the word universe comes from Latin, uni meaning one and versus meaning turned or changed. One single turning. One eternal moment of transformation. It‚Äôs like, everything we perceive is just this one continuous change, and we‚Äôre all inseparable parts of this grand cosmic dance.
The Earth spinning at what, 67,000 miles per hour through the vastness of space? And here I am sometimes feeling so static, so trapped in my thoughts and behavioral patterns. But I‚Äôm not stuck at all, am I? I‚Äôm literally hurtling through the cosmos on this celestial rock, with blood rushing through my veins, lungs expanding and contracting in perfect rhythm without any effort on my part.
Why do we humans fight so desperately against this fundamental nature of reality though? The inevitability of change, I mean. We grip onto things, relationships, and ideas as if they were solid, permanent fixtures in our lives. But they‚Äôre not. Nothing truly is. Even this precise moment, right now, as I‚Äôm carefully crafting these thoughts, it‚Äôs already slipped into the past. New moment. New me. New everything. The ancient Taoists had profound insight into this truth, I think. That whole concept of wu wei, effortless action through non-action. Not forcing, not controlling, just, flowing naturally. Being authentic. Like water finding its elegant path around any obstacle it encounters.
I‚Äôve been consciously trying to be aware things lately in my daily life. Just, observing with full attention. Watching how everything moves in its own perfect rhythm. The wind dancing through the trees. The clouds constantly shifting and reforming overhead. The way my emotions rise and fall like waves on an infinite ocean. The way my thoughts change like the weather. It‚Äôs all part of this massive, endless cosmic dance, isn‚Äôt it? And I‚Äôm not outside of it, not some detached observer. I AM it.
That realization is simultaneously terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. I am the change itself. Not separate from it. Not controlling it. Just, being it in each moment. My breath serves as a constant reminder of this truth. Each breath uniquely different from the last. Never exactly the same twice. A persistent reminder that change isn‚Äôt something that happens TO us, it‚Äôs what we ARE at our core.
You know what‚Äôs been particularly helpful in deepening my understanding of this  flow of change? These simple mindfulness practices I‚Äôve been experimenting with lately. Like in the morning, instead of rigidly forcing myself to stick to some predetermined routine, I try to sensitively feel what feels right in each moment. What the natural flow is calling for. It‚Äôs often subtle, not some dramatic shift in behavior, but rather small mindful adjustments. Following the natural rhythm of life instead of constantly fighting against it.
I‚Äôve been paying closer attention to attention itself. It‚Äôs easy to overlook, but where I focus determines the reality I experience.
One morning, I walked the same path to the store that I‚Äôve taken many times, but this time, I decided to really see it. The golden light filtering through the trees, the shifting patterns of leaves, the way the air carried the faint scent of earth and asphalt warming in the sun, how each step felt as my foot touched the ground, the songs the birds were singing. It wasn‚Äôt a new place, but it felt new because I was actually present in it, engaging all of my senses. 
It makes me wonder, how much of life do we miss because we‚Äôre not really looking?
Attention is like a lens. Zoom in on a problem, and it expands until it feels insurmountable. Shift focus to something beautiful, and suddenly, the world is filled with wonder. It‚Äôs not that reality changes, it‚Äôs that we tune into different aspects of it.
I think that‚Äôs why distractions feel so draining. Not because they steal time, but because they scatter focus, leaving us stretched thin across a thousand unimportant things. When attention is fragmented, life feels chaotic to me. But when it‚Äôs focused, when I deliberately choose what to notice, life feels whole again.
The mental aspects of life are definitely the most challenging though. These persistent thoughts that spin and spiral endlessly, creating their own little universes of worry and endless what if scenarios. But even they‚Äôre not solid or permanent. They come and go like weather patterns across the sky of consciousness. Dark clouds, sunny skies, storms, peaceful calm, all passing through the same vast space of pure awareness. I‚Äôm gradually learning to watch them without getting hopelessly caught up in their drama.
It‚Äôs easy to believe we are our thoughts, that they define us. But what if the truest version of ourselves exists in the space between them? That moment when a deep breath settles, when the mind is still, and all that remains is pure awareness.
I‚Äôve been noticing lately what happens when I stop chasing thoughts and instead focus on the gaps between them. It‚Äôs like staring at the night sky. At first, you only notice the stars, the bright points of light scattered across the darkness. But the more you look, the more you realize that the vast space between them is just as important. The silence, the emptiness it‚Äôs not empty at all. It‚Äôs where everything unfolds.
This one morning, as I was sipping coffee, I decided to sit in complete stillness and simply watch my thoughts. Not engage with them, not follow them into their usual spirals, just observe. At first, they rushed in like a flood things I needed to do, things I should have said in past conversations, random flashes of worry. But then something interesting happened. As I sat without reacting, the thoughts began to slow. Like leaves floating downstream, they drifted past one by one instead of piling up in a chaotic swirl. And in between them, these brief but profound pauses emerged, pockets of stillness where I wasn‚Äôt thinking at all, just existing.
In those moments, I wasn‚Äôt replaying the past or predicting the future. I wasn‚Äôt constructing an identity or wrestling with some self-imposed expectation. I was simply there. 
The more I sit with this awareness, the more I realize that reality isn‚Äôt found in my thoughts but in the quiet space between them. It‚Äôs like music the notes matter, but the silence between them is what gives them meaning. Perhaps our lives work the same way.
Then there‚Äôs this profound concept of non-attachment  that I‚Äôve been wrestling with lately. Not in some cold, emotionally disconnected way that some might misinterpret it as, but in this deeply loving and accepting way of being. I can care intensely and passionately about things and people while also maintaining a understanding that everything in this universe is temporary, always in a state of flux and transformation. This perspective has actually enhanced my appreciation for life‚Äôs precious moments. When you truly internalize that nothing is permanent, you naturally cherish each experience more deeply in the present moment.
I‚Äôve been developing a heightened sensitivity to how energy flows  through different spaces and situations in my daily life. Like how some environments just feel heavy and stagnant, as if the energy has become trapped and needs clearing, while others feel light, vibrant and alive with possibility. Or how certain individuals seem to have this remarkable ability to shift the energetic frequency of an entire room just by walking into it. We‚Äôre all these complex fields of living energy, constantly influencing and being influenced by everything and everyone around us in this intricate dance of interconnection.
Emotional alchemy is something I‚Äôve been playing with more and more, and the deeper I go, the more I see that it‚Äôs all about vibration and rhythm. The Hermetic teachings say that everything is in constant motion, that nothing truly rests, and when you really sit with that, it starts to make a strange kind of sense. Every emotion, every thought, every interaction is part of this endless flow of movement. The energy of a room, the weight of a conversation, the heaviness or lightness in a moment it‚Äôs all just different frequencies vibrating at different speeds.
I‚Äôve noticed how sometimes I‚Äôll walk into a space and immediately feel the energy there, like stepping into a pool of water that‚Äôs either warm and inviting or cold and unsettling. It‚Äôs not something you can see, but it‚Äôs something you can feel, a kind of resonance that settles into your bones. Some places buzz with a kind of life, an effortless hum that lifts you without you even realizing it. Others feel stagnant, as if the energy has slowed to a crawl and settled like dust in the corners. And people carry their own frequencies too. Some walk into a room and seem to bring a gravitational pull with them, drawing everyone‚Äôs energy into their orbit. Others radiate like tuning forks, shifting the entire environment just by being there.
But here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: vibration is never fixed. It can be shifted, nudged, tuned like an instrument. And I‚Äôve found that humor especially the kind of humor that catches you off guard, the kind that makes you laugh in spite of yourself is one of the fastest ways to change the frequency of a space. It‚Äôs hard to stay locked in a heavy, low vibration when you‚Äôre laughing at something ridiculous. A well-placed joke, a silly observation, even a groan-worthy dad joke it all works like an energetic tuning fork, shaking loose the stuck energy and bringing in something lighter, more fluid.
It makes sense when you think about it in terms of rhythm. Everything moves in cycles, in patterns, in waves. The Hermetic principle of Rhythm says that nothing stays in one state forever emotions rise and fall, energy expands and contracts, situations shift like the tides. You can feel it in a conversation when it starts to drag, the energy dipping, the natural rhythm losing its flow. That‚Äôs when I step in, not to force a change, but to remind the moment of its own movement. A joke, a playful comment, a little absurdity it‚Äôs like tapping a stalled pendulum to get it swinging again. The rhythm was always there; it just needed a little push to remember itself.
I‚Äôve started paying closer attention to this in my own life, noticing the ways rhythm and vibration play out in everyday interactions. When people are caught in a spiral of frustration, their energy looping in the same low-frequency pattern, I can almost hear it like a stuck note in a song. And if I throw something unexpected into the mix something that makes them pause, blink, and then laugh it‚Äôs like changing the key of the entire melody. The tension breaks, the rhythm resets, and suddenly, the conversation moves somewhere new.
Of course, it‚Äôs not about avoiding difficult emotions or pretending everything is light when it‚Äôs not. Some moments are meant to be heavy. Some emotions need to be felt fully, allowed to run their course. But even within those moments, there‚Äôs rhythm. Grief moves in waves. Anger surges and then fades. Nothing is static, even when it feels like it is. And when I recognize that, I realize that I don‚Äôt have to fight the low points I just have to ride them, knowing that they will shift in their own time. And when the moment is right, I can introduce something to help the rhythm flow again, to lift the vibration just enough to remind everyone that movement is still possible.
It‚Äôs fascinating to watch how this works in group dynamics. You can feel when a group is in sync, their energy flowing together like a well-played piece of music. And you can feel when something is off, when the rhythm is disjointed, the notes clashing. I‚Äôve been experimenting with seeing myself as a kind of conductor in these moments, not in a controlling way, but in a way that listens for the underlying beat and finds where a shift is needed. Sometimes it‚Äôs humor, sometimes it‚Äôs a shift in perspective, sometimes it‚Äôs just the right word at the right time. It‚Äôs all about feeling the rhythm and knowing when to add to it, when to step back, and when to simply trust that the movement will find itself again.
And then there are those moments when everything aligns perfectly, when the energy is just right, when the rhythm is effortless and alive. Those moments don‚Äôt happen by force; they happen by flow. And the more I pay attention to vibration and rhythm, the more I realize that I can tune into that flow not by controlling it, but by moving with it. By knowing when to introduce lightness, when to let things settle, when to push the pendulum, and when to simply ride the wave.
Maybe that‚Äôs what emotional alchemy really is not changing emotions through force, but recognizing their natural movement and working with them instead of against them. It‚Äôs not about denying the lows, but about knowing they are part of the rhythm, and that rhythm is always in motion. And when the moment calls for it, when the energy is stuck and heavy, sometimes all it takes is a stupid dad joke to remind everyone that nothing stays still forever. That movement is inevitable. That laughter, even in the darkest moments, is a vibration strong enough to shake the dust from the air and let the light back in.
I‚Äôve been actively experimenting with applying this understanding to my relationships as well. It's fascinating to observe how differently these connections feel when you release the need to control everything, when you allow people the freedom to be who they authentically are instead of who you think they should be according to your preferences and projections. The more I let go of rigid expectations and demands, the more genuine and vibrant these relationships naturally become. 
There‚Äôs something about sinking fully into the moment with someone that deepens the connection in a way nothing else can. When I stop trying to shape the conversation or lead it somewhere specific and instead simply flow with it, the entire interaction shifts. It‚Äôs like dropping into the rhythm of a song when I let myself be present, the conversation finds its own natural beat, and the connection strengthens in a way that feels effortless.
I‚Äôve noticed that when I let people have the interactions they are seeking, instead of imposing my own expectations, they become more comfortable. It‚Äôs as if they relax into their own rhythm, no longer trying to match an external expectation but instead moving in a way that feels right to them. And in doing so, the interaction becomes more authentic, more natural. It‚Äôs a reminder that real connection isn‚Äôt about steering things a certain way it‚Äôs about allowing each person to be fully themselves within the shared moment.
Maybe, just like with emotional energy, relationships flourish when we stop trying to force a specific outcome and instead learn to ride the rhythm of the interaction, trusting that it will take us exactly where we need to go.

1ixdjvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastMinuteGenius/comments/1ixdjvw/my_story/,My Story,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a game-changing trick that helped me finally overcome that nagging mental barrier to starting tasks. If you're constantly putting off projects because they seem too overwhelming or annoying, you might find this helpful.

You have probably heard of The 5-Minute Rule, in fact I have a post of it on this subreddit. If you haven't read it, the idea is ridiculously simple: commit to working on any task for just five minutes. Whether it's writing something, cleaning your desk, or brainstorming ideas, those five minutes can kickstart your momentum. I used to think every project needed a full-blown, perfect start, but all it took was five minutes to get going.

My Experience with the 5-Minute Rule

* I was stuck in a cycle of procrastination, feeling paralyzed by the fear of not doing something perfectly. dread at all the things I had to do, and guilt for not wanting to do them.  So, I tried the 5-Minute Rule, and here‚Äôs what happened:
* It Lowered My Anxiety: Starting something was no longer a challenge because I only promised myself five minutes. It didn‚Äôt matter if I stopped after that or continued if I felt like it.
* It Built Momentum: More often than not, I ended up working way past the initial five minutes once I got into the groove.
* I Formed a Habit: Consistently dedicating five minutes eventually turned into a reliable habit that made me see the challenge in a different light and knowing it would only take five minutes changed my mindset.

Here Are Some Tips That Helped Me Stick With It

* Set a Timer: Using a timer really makes it feel like a mini challenge. It also keeps distractions at bay.
* Pick the Right Task: Start with something you‚Äôve been dreading. Once you begin, you might find it‚Äôs not as bad as you thought. For me it was washing the dishes. I am not sure why, but I dreaded doing it. Once I used the 5-minute rule, it really didn't bother me as much as I ""thought"" it would. I think the feeling of accomplishment was more powerful than my dread, if that makes sense.
* Create a Ritual: I like to pair my five-minute work session with a cup of coffee or a favorite song. Even listening to a pod cast while your doing dishes, cleaning the  house is fun. It creates a positive vibe around getting started.
* Minimize Distractions: I turn off notifications and silence your phone. It is only for 5-minutes and every second counts, even if it's just five.
* Reward Yourself: After your session, even if it‚Äôs only five minutes, give yourself a small treat. It reinforces the habit.
* Reflect and Adjust: Take a moment at the end to acknowledge your progress and consider if you can gradually extend your work sessions.

# The Science (and Psychology) Behind It

It turns out that the hardest part of any task is simply **getting started**. By reducing the commitment to five minutes, you lower the activation energy needed to begin working. This small step is often all it takes to overcome the paralysis of perfectionism and procrastination.

# My Takeaway

Before using the 5-Minute Rule, I was constantly overwhelmed, full of dread and doubted my ability to complete tasks. Now, not only am I more productive, but I also feel a lot more confident. Every small win builds up, and suddenly those daunting tasks become manageable challenges.

If you‚Äôve been struggling with procrastination or fear of starting something new, give the 5-Minute Rule a try. Set a timer, take that tiny step, and let the momentum carry you forward. Trust me‚Äîit works!

Cheers,

RunnyLemon

1ixdjof,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ixdjof/can_waterdrop_g3p600_reverse_osmosis_system/,Can Waterdrop G3P600 Reverse Osmosis System deliver the cleanest water? A review on its filtration prowess and features.,"Testing out the Waterdrop G3P600 Reverse Osmosis System has been an enlightening journey for me as someone who values clean and safe drinking water. This tankless under-sink filtration system promises advanced filtration, a sleek design, and high capacity. But does it truly live up to the hype? Here‚Äôs my take after weeks of daily use.

**Ease of Installation & Use**  
Setting up the Waterdrop G3P600 was relatively straightforward. The system includes clear instructions, and all components are labeled for easy identification. I appreciated that the connections were color-coded, meaning even someone with minimal plumbing skills‚Äîlike me‚Äîcould handle the installation without breaking a sweat. However, I did encounter one hiccup: the unit requires a nearby power outlet. Fortunately, I already had one under my sink, but this could be a challenge for others. Once installed, the intuitive design of the smart display faucet made it simple to monitor the system‚Äôs performance.

[Check Waterdrop G3P600 Reverse Osmosis System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07p1xfyjp/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**  
This is where this RO system truly shines. The G3P600 boasts an 8-stage filtration process certified to NSF/ANSI standards, ensuring the removal of contaminants such as chlorine, heavy metals, fluoride, and more. Living in an area with hard water, the difference in taste was immediate. My wife even commented that our coffee tasted noticeably smoother. The built-in TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) monitor consistently displayed low readings, demonstrating the system‚Äôs efficiency. I tested this against an external TDS meter, and the results aligned perfectly. However, I‚Äôve read some users reporting discrepancies with the TDS monitor, so it might not always be flawless.

**Flow Rate & Performance**  
The high-capacity design delivers 600 gallons per day, and the flow rate is surprisingly fast for an RO system. Filling an 8-ounce glass of water took just around 8 seconds. This is a game-changer for anyone who‚Äôs used slower systems in the past. Whether I needed water for drinking, cooking, or rinsing vegetables, the G3P600 didn‚Äôt keep me waiting.

**Capacity & Suitability**  
For a household of four, including two teenagers who seem to be perpetually thirsty, the Waterdrop G3P600 easily kept up with our demands. Its tankless design not only saves space under the sink but also eliminates the risk of bacterial buildup commonly associated with traditional tank-based systems. However, if you have a larger family or a high daily water demand, you might need to monitor the filter lifespan closely.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**  
Changing filters is a breeze with this system. A quick twist-and-lock mechanism allows you to replace them in seconds without tools. The LED indicator on the faucet alerts you when it‚Äôs time for a replacement. However, accessing replacement filters can sometimes be a challenge. I noticed some users mentioned occasional shortages of the CF filter. While I haven‚Äôt faced this issue personally, it‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on.

**Features**  
The smart LED faucet is one of my favorite features. It provides real-time data on water quality and filter life, which adds a futuristic touch to my kitchen. The system also boasts a low waste-to-pure water ratio of 2:1, making it environmentally friendly. This is a significant improvement over older RO systems that can waste up to 4 gallons of water for every gallon purified.

**Certifications**  
Knowing that this system meets NSF/ANSI 42, 58, and 372 standards gave me peace of mind regarding its safety and performance. It‚Äôs also certified for lead-free materials, a critical feature for families with young children.

**Warranty**  
The warranty is fairly standard, covering defects in materials and workmanship. While I haven‚Äôt had to use it (thankfully), I‚Äôve read positive experiences from others who found Waterdrop‚Äôs customer service responsive and helpful.

**Strong Points**

* High filtration efficiency with NSF/ANSI certifications.
* Tankless design saves space and prevents bacteria growth.
* Fast flow rate meets the needs of busy households.
* Smart LED faucet for real-time monitoring.
* Easy filter replacement process.

**Caveats**

* Requires a power outlet under the sink.
* Occasional difficulty in sourcing replacement filters.
* Built-in TDS monitor might not always be accurate.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to competitors like the APEC ROES-50 or the iSpring RCC7AK, the Waterdrop G3P600 stands out for its tankless design and faster flow rate. While the APEC model is more budget-friendly, it doesn‚Äôt match the Waterdrop in space-saving or filtration speed. On the other hand, the iSpring system offers a remineralization stage, which some users might prefer for taste. However, if you‚Äôre prioritizing efficiency and modern aesthetics, the G3P600 is hard to beat.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its advanced filtration, high capacity, and sleek design, the Waterdrop G3P600 is a solid investment for anyone seeking premium water purification. While it might seem pricier upfront, the long-term savings on bottled water and the convenience it provides make it worth every penny.

They asked me to watch a door to make sure no one came in, but to absolutely NOT watch their satanic ritual. But the door that they positioned me in front of had a mirror in front of it, and I absolutely DID watch them pouring pigs blood through a rams horn. And I absolutely DID hear them chanting in a foreign language, possibly latin. And then I absolutely did hear them say in unison ""Hail Satan!"" and then that was the end of it... I was left there wondering what it was I had just seen. I thought I would see a team building exercise where people would do trust falls, and I fully understood the desire to not have people witness that, as maybe that is embarrassing, I was not prepared for all the blood. I had just started that job, and the overall feeling I had upon seeing this is ""I am not sure this is what I want to do with my life."" Fast forward eleven years, and I am still there.

\-I stand 6'2"", A lot of great men were much shorter than me. Muggsy Bogues (5'3""), James Madison (5'3""), Winston Churchill (5'5""), John F Kennedy (6'0), Michael J Fox (5'3""), ¬†Daniel Radcliffe (5'4""), and Dax Shepard (6'1""). I am not a religious person, but if the average male height is 5'9"" then that would make me taller than most, and if height brings you closer to God then I guess that makes me a godly person. I don't know if I subscribe to that though, as I am friends with someone (humble brag) who is 6'5"" and he is a piece of shit.

\-I like the idea of books more than reading seemingly. Every month I buy more books and place them on every available surface until the piles look like they may topple over. Every book that I have ever read has a bus transfer in it from the day that I started the book. Even now where I no longer rely on buses to get me from point a to point b, I will walk to the bus stop by my house, pay three dollars for a bus transfer, ride the bus a single stop, get off and walk home while listening to The Clash or something. When I was a kid I bought a copy of Breakfast of Champions at a garage sale and inside was a bus transfer from 1978, and that blew my mind to have a piece of paper from before I was born. I guess I had the idea that although I am told that the earth is millions and billions and bajillions of years old, I had never seen proof of that until I had that bus transfer in my hand. And so I keep transfers in all of my books in case I one day sell my collection of barely read books and in doing so I can make a small child feel insignificant.

\-As I write this, my dogs are sitting on the couch together looking out the window like they are some kind of buddy cops on a stakeout. Should they see a cat, a squirrel, a person, a plastic bag they will stand up from the couch and bark for a solid three minutes until the neighbourhood knows that the threat from the evil cat/rodent/human/inanimate object had been thwarted, and should you see them on the street next time we are on a walk you should thank them for keeping these streets safe. They are also not opposed to gifts of treats, and wouldn't be opposed to a statue in their likeness.

Once I told them that they jointly won the award for best pups as given by the United Nations, and I haven't had the heart to tell them I had made it up. Should you meet them, please don't sell me out, they are so proud. I won't sell you out regarding the lies that you tell your pet/children/co-workers/spouse/self, they can believe it all.

\-I had the worst first date of my life the other day. It was entirely my fault. I travel for work, I was worn out, I was sick. I was also very excited to meet this person, so I didn't cancel. I really should have. I went on the date, had zero energy, blew the thing, was told that she felt no connection, and I understood as to why, as I was barely able to complete a sentence, drove her home. And then a day later ended up in the hospital with pneumonia. I am really good at talking. I am a really good listener. I ask thoughtful questions. I am used to being kind of successful with these things, and that's not me vigorously patting myself on the back...I am not someone who can rest on how amazingly beautiful they are. I NEED to show up. And I didn't. and I blew it. and I regret it. but like, I had pneumonia. And, I should have cancelled, but thought that I would be better by the time I saw her. And alas, I was not. Anyways, all of this to say that I make mistakes.

Here's the dilly, I am still recovering from this, both emotionally and physically. I have laid on the couch watching Taskmaster, and drinking mass amounts of tea with honey pretty much every day since. Im lonely tho. I could reach out to friends, but I read a tweet once that was something like ""Hey, did you get that job that you talked about every day about applying for, and then never mentioned again?"" except replace ""job."" with ""Person I was actually quite fond of."" shit. 

I love weirdos.

I have an interesting job in the arts, which has me traveling often.

I am left politically. and my parents would adore you if you were conservative and weirdly racist. I wouldn't like you, but my parents would adore you. I likely wouldn't be too keen to talk to someone who wasn't left leaning. With everything that is happening, being right leaning is abhorrent, and being apolitical is just so unaware.

I am in therapy. I've done a lot of it. I really enjoy others who are in therapy as well. But, at the same time, I would be happy with someone with some self awareness.

I'm into community.

I love comedy, and consume it in a million different ways. I used to sell jokes to local stand up comedians in my early twenties. 100% of these stand up comedians went on to be failed stand up comedians. I am not sure if it was my jokes, or their delivery, but I feel partially responsible. I love comedy writing. I love storytelling. I love books, and movies, and tv, and podcasts. I go to stand up shows and improv.

I am passionate about live music, good books, good coffee, and good people.

Sagen er den at, jeg k√∏bte en brugt pc for ca 5 √•r siden. Det var min f√∏rste station√¶r, s√• jeg havde ikke super meget forstand p√• det. Jeg k√∏bte ud fra det mine venner sagde var godt. Den er med tiden blevet sl√∏vere, og det har jeg ladet mig h√∏rer er ret normalt, MEN det er g√•et meget st√¶rkt.

Indtil for et par uger siden hvor jeg fandte ud af at min CPU har v√¶ret overclocked lige siden jeg k√∏bte den, og jeg ved ikke hvor l√¶nge den har v√¶ret det f√∏r jeg overtog den.

her er setup:

CPU: Intel Core i5 8600K @ 3.60GHz Coffee Lake 14nm Technology (ligger mellem 45-65 grader)

RAM: 16GB ukendt m√¶rke

Motherboard: ASRock H370M-ITX/ac

Grafikkort: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050TI

Som i kan se, er de dele ikke lige frem nye, og det er jo s√•dan det er. De har fungeret fint, indtil inden for de sidste par uger hvor den virkelig er blevet langsom, jeg har haft flere venner med mere forstand, til at kigge p√• det, og de siger det er fordi min CPU er tr√¶t, og det de andre dele egenlig ogs, og de tr√¶nger til at komme p√• pension. Vi har pr√∏vet og fabriksindstille den, og self√∏lgelig reng√∏re den, men det havde ingen effekt.

Jeg kan lige knap tr√¶kke ETS, CS2, og begge spil k√∏rer med 40-60fps, og det er meget hit and miss, enten k√∏rer det nogenlunde, eller s√• er der virkelig mange lag spikes, og faktisk umuligt at spille.

SKAL JEG:

1. K√∏be et motherboard kit p√• komplet til 3500kr, som indeholder motherboard, CPU, RAM, og k√∏ller

2. Spare flere penge op p√• min meget stramme ydelse, ogs√• k√∏be en helt ny pc? dette vil nok tag 6-10 m√•neder

Coffee
Creamer
Heater 
Salt/Pepper
Suger and sweetener
Moist towelette
Toilet Roll
Lemon flavour low calorie beverage

Beef Taco was nice to start with, nice texture and a little bit spicy with a decent beefy flavour

Santa Fe rice and beans were also ok to start with, a creamy slightly spicy mix of beans and rice and maybe some jalapeno.

Tortillas were excellent for and item that lasts for years, tastes similar to fresh store purchases ones.

Cheese spread was delicious but the MRE lacked any crackers to enjoy it with. To finish I ate the last of it with some crackers I had.

In the end I made some tacos including the beef, rice and beans and some cheese. Was pretty good but the texture and flavour of the beef and rice/bean mixture was very similar and I could see how a person could get flavour fatigue quickly.

Coffee was excellent, had it with creamer, just the right strength. Tasted like mid range instant coffee I could purchase here in Ireland.

The nuts and chocolate were really nice, tasted so fresh and the chocolate/smarties sweetened them up nicely.

The heater didn't work the best so I used my little gas stove to finish heating the beef and rice.

I should have done it sooner. Maybe you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm an absolute twat for waiting, hesitating, for letting my mind get tangled in all these possibilities instead of just calling the police and opening my mouth. But I did it, I went to the police. 

For those of you not in the know, I‚Äôll link my first post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwb4su/someone_keeps_sending_me_weird_pictures_at_3am/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

I told them everything. About the photos, the room, the‚Ä¶ stranger. I left out the reddit part because they would probably put me on a register. Just said that I‚Äôd received anonymous messages, and one night, the photos started. That I feel like someone wanted me to see this, to know about it. I told them how I‚Äôd spent time trying to figure it out myself, how long I‚Äôd looked at those photos for clues. At the end of the day though, I‚Äôm not a detective, I didn‚Äôt have the know-how.

The enquiry officer at the desk signposted me to a Police Constable ‚Äì who was serious but not unfriendly, to be perfectly honest he looked bored as he tapped at his keyboard, nodding along like he had heard it all before. I told him about the pictures. About the room, the blood, the bindings.

‚ÄúAre you sure that this isn‚Äôt someone pissing you around? He asked me.
‚ÄúPeople do this type of stuff all the time.‚Äù

I told them no. I know what real fear looked like. That I could feel it in my gut.

They told me that they would look into it. They‚Äôd trace the number and see if there were any missing persons or crimes in the area that matched what I described. They took my phone, said they‚Äôd ‚Äúanalyse the metadata‚Äù from the pictures. I walked out of the station feeling ‚Äì what? Relieved? Not quite. Like I‚Äôd handed off a burden that wasn‚Äôt really mine to carry in the first place.

I haven‚Äôt heard from them yet. No updates. I haven‚Äôt really been on my phone since ‚Äì I feel like it belongs to them now, even though they gave it back. Like they‚Äôrewatching me through it, waiting for me to slip up and say something wrong. I know that‚Äôs paranoia talking, but that feeling doesn‚Äôt shake so easily.

- -

I woke up today feeling‚Ä¶. Normal. About as normal I can get, the kind of morning where the world resets itself a little bit. My bed was warm, the air outside grey and calm. I climbed out, stretched, let the bones in my back click themselves into place. I padded down the stairs, still in my t-shirt and boxers, rubbing at my face like I could scrub the leftover thoughts out of my skull.

Mum was in the lounge, the glow of the TV flickering against her face. Supermarket Sweep, again. She loves her reruns, laughing at the same old jokes, reacting to it like it was brand new. The smell of tea in her untouched mug curled through the air.

Dad was in the garden, the back door was wide open (again), letting in the chill of the fresh morning air. He was crouched by the flower beds, turning soil with his hands and planting small bulbs.

I made myself breakfast. Toast, coffee. Sat at the table, listening to the faint sound of my dad working outside and the occasional chuckle of the lounge. The house was quiet this morning, in a way that homes get when they have settled into themselves. A three-bedroom detached house - nothing too special. Brown brick, front garden that looked tidy from a distance but a little neglected the closer you got to it. The kind of place where families grow up and move on. Except we never really moved on after my brother joined the army.

I finished eating, rinsed my plate in the sink and got dressed for work ‚Äì the usual uniform-nothing that could get caught in machinery. The walk to the abattoir wasn‚Äôt long, but it always felt further than it was. The air smelled like wet concrete and metal the closer you got to the gates.

Bryant was already there, leaning against the chain link fence, smoking a cigarette like he was trying to finish it before it burned him. He is a tall, thin and pale specimen, always slouching like he is bracing for impact. He looked up as I approached, his mouth already halfway forming a question.

‚ÄúJesus, mate. You look like shit!‚Äù

Business as usual.

 - -

The abattoir was a contradiction, Cold and sterile, but always humming with the quiet violence of its purpose. The floors are always spotless, a true testament to industrial-strength cleaners and the efficiency of men and women in plastic aprons and chainmail gloves.

I work the killing line. Not the bolt gun ‚Äì no, that was for the senior workers. I handled the shackles. Hooked the stunned bodies by their hind legs and sent them up, one after another, a steady, inevitable chain of rhythm and pigs. The air is always thick with an irony smell and something deeper, more primal. A smell that clung to me no matter how many showers I took.

After a few hours of sending pigs to meet their maker, I went for my lunch. Bryant was waiting for me in the break room. His uniform is ridiculously ill fitting, hanging incredibly loose on his pale skin in the flickering fluorescent lights. He looked at me the same way he always does lately ‚Äì like I was an animal he wasn‚Äôt sure was safe to approach.

‚ÄúAny news?‚Äù he asked, voice too casual.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing yet‚Äù

Bryant frowned. ‚ÄúSo, they just downloaded your phone and sent you home?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said they‚Äôd follow up.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you believe them?‚Äù He smirked.

I didn‚Äôt answer. Because what was there to say? The police didn‚Äôt care. Not really. Not about some grainy images sent to a nobody from an untraceable number.

Bryant exhaled through his nose, a frustrated little sound as he played around with the vending machine.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucked up, man. I mean‚Ä¶ You saw that guy. You saw his face!‚Äù

I did. Swollen, bloody, mouth half open in a scream that wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave his throat.

‚ÄúHe looked‚Ä¶ familiar‚Äù Bryant added, almost hesitant.

My body stiffened. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Bryant shifted uncomfortably as he sat down.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ seeing someone like that, you start imagining things. Making connections that aren‚Äôt there.‚Äù

A sharp silence settled between us for the rest of our break time.

I stood, ready to get back to work.

‚ÄúMy break‚Äôs over.‚Äù

- -

After work I decided that I‚Äôd take the scenic route home, besides, the fresh air would do me some good after spending all day worrying. I walked past streets that felt too quiet. The sky had the heavy grey of a day that never quite woke up, the air damp from the earlier rain. 
I thought about what Bryant said earlier, I thought about my brother. About the day he left, duffel bag slung over his shoulder, boots polished to a dull shine. He‚Äôd decided he was going to join the army a few years ago ‚Äì Royal Anglian Regiment. Said he wanted structure, purpose. Something more than this town, this family.

I haven‚Äôt seen him in years. Not really. Calls eventually got shorter. Texts and letters stopped. He‚Äôd slipped away, much to the behest of my mum, piece by piece, until he was just a name, just an idea of someone who used to be close.

My phone vibrated.

My body went completely cold, as if my blood had turned to ice. I hesitated before pulling it from my pocket.

18:26pm

A new number.

A new picture.

I can‚Äôt move, not because I‚Äôm scared but because the image demands stillness, like I‚Äôm a deer caught in headlights. This was a completely different picture. No bound beaten man, no fresh horror laid bare. Instead, something quieter ‚Äì something worse.

It was a hallway, long and narrow, suffocated by deep shadows that the weak, yellow light overhead can‚Äôt seem to reach.

The walls were covered in old wallpaper, a faded floral pattern that might have once been white, but had been rotted into a sickly, nicotine-stained yellow. The edges curl away from the plaster, revealing dark gaps, as if the walls are trying to peel away their own skin.

The floorboards, warped with age, look damp, as if something had soaked into the hard wood over years, staining it in uneven black streaks. The kind of house where the air never quite moves, where the dust settles and stays, thick and undisturbed. Stale.

Then my eyes catch on something.

A door. Slightly ajar.

A sliver of darkness splits the frame, just wide enough to see something ‚Äì someone ‚Äì peering through.

At first, it‚Äôs nothing but a vague shape in the gloom. A shadow against a deeper shadow. But I can see something more, my stomach drops with a sickening lurch, like an elevator cable fraying one strand at a time.

A grin.

A wide, unnatural grin, stretched too far across a face that remains mostly hidden in the crack. The lips are dry and cracked, curling upwards into a grotesque mimicry of human expression. Too many teeth ‚Äì too white ‚Äì catch the dim light in jagged, uneven rows, like something carved from bone rather than grown.

It digs into my brain like a rusted hook, catching somewhere deep in my matter. A pressure in my chest builds, like a great hand with fingers splayed across my ribs, testing and squeezing for cracks.

The longer I look, the more wrong it seems. The corners of the mouth strain, struggling to contain the pearly white teeth, as if something behind the face is pulling at the skin, forcing it to smile, a smile that isn‚Äôt meant to be there.

Everything feels wrong now. Not just in the way a stranger looking through your window feels wrong, but deeper ‚Äì like an error in the fabric of reality itself. Like the world has glitched, and I‚Äôm the only one who sees it.

Another message.

‚ÄúI CAN SEE YOU.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if this is a statement or a threat.

- -

The walk home is different this time. I don‚Äôt hear footsteps ‚Äì I feel them. The way they echo a half step too late, like there is another pair just out of sync with mine. The streetlights hum overhead, their glow too sharp, too sterile. Every window and house I pass feels like a watching eye.

I keep my hands stuffed in my pockets; my breath is shallow. My skin prickles with something I can‚Äôt shake, something crawling out from beneath the surface. I don‚Äôt dare turn around, but I know ‚Äì I know ‚Äì if I do something will be standing just far enough away to make me doubt if I ever saw it.

By the time I step up to my front door, my chest is tight, lungs burning from the pace I had just walked. My hands trembledas I fished for my keys, shoving them into the lock with more force than I needed, feeling as though I was going to explode through the door.

Inside, everything is‚Ä¶ Normal.

Mum is still in the lounge, curled in her chair watching supermarket sweep. She lets out a little chuckle at something that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out, her hand folded neatly in her lap, cup of tea at her side.

Dad is outside in the garden. I catch a glimpse of him through the window as I pass by ‚Äì hunched over something in the shed, his shoulders moving like he‚Äôs focussed on some unseen tasks. The door slightly ajar, spilling a thin sliver of light onto the grass. He doesn‚Äôt look up. 

No messages.
No pictures.
No grinning faces in the dark.
I let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt realised I was holding. 

The routine helps. Brushing my teeth, undressing, settling into bed. The familiarity of it dulls the jagged edge of unease. My phone remains silent, untouched on my bedside table.

For the first time in days, I feel like maybe ‚Äì maybe ‚Äì this is over. 

I wake to the soft, unnatural glow of my phone screen in the darkness

Right now, my exercise consists of three upper body workouts a week and six days of running with Mondays off. This week I've got my highest mile load that I've ever attempted with 110 running miles over the next six days.

The diet that has worked best for me is skipping breakfast with coffee, a small lunch, and saving most of my calories for dinner. That has changed some as I've started running really long distances, but I still eat the majority of my calories for dinner.

1ixdb2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixdb2q/help_i_am_seeking_adviceclosure_27m26f/,Help: I am seeking advice/closure (27M/26F)?,"I was in a relationship or situationship 2.5 years ago. When we met, he was very into it. I was just starting grad school. We went on a couple of dates. I stayed the night at his place twice. He never stayed over at mine, or came to visit. I found out that he was talking to other girls a few months into my graduate studies. My campus was a 45 minute ride away from his apartment , so if he wasn't into a ""long distance relationship"" I wish he would've told me. I had been in a few relationships before that one with serial cheaters, so I took it pretty hard and my studies started to slip. Obviously, I knew I couldn't trust him, but I stayed in it for a while. I think I was the one who made effort 90% of the time. I would invite him to do things like a double date and he would magically come up with some excuse as to why he couldn't do it only minutes before it was supposed to happen. My best friend and roommate at the time, a girl who can find the good in anyone, was amazed that he didn't even have a couch in his apartment when I told her. She also was very put off by him when he visited our campus to buy a cellphone charger and didn't even stop by for a minute or two to say hi. I kept having to call him out and question if he really wanted to be in any kind of relationship with me because I kept catching him talking to other girls. One night I had a heart to heart with two of my best friends and they said I needed to make a move to stay or leave. I called him after the intervention and confronted him about why he was so hot and cold. He said that he had a lot of trouble being emotionally vulnerable with anyone and that ""you can't teach a dog new tricks"". The dude was 25 at the time.. 
I told him I needed him to figure out what he wanted because my mental health was suffering. The next morning he told me that he was done and that he couldn't be what I needed. I tried to reason with him but he left me on read. Fast forward 2.5 years later, I am in a healthy and stable relationship with the love of my life. My ex still looks at my Instagram story every day and is always one of the first 5 people to view it. He messaged me a year ago to see if I wanted to get coffee. I said no, I was busy. 
I guess I'm still trying to figure him out. I don't want this past mistake to bleed into my current healthy relationship. Given the person my ex is, I don't think I will ever get closure or an explanation of why he did what he did. I guess I am just looking for closure and advice?",1,1740431923.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1ixdaac,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ixdaac/why_did_eating_8_slices_of_bread_prevent_me_from/,Why did eating 8 slices of bread prevent me from seemingly passing out or seizing? 37M,"Hi - bit of a peculiar problem.

37M no meds and no general health conditions that I‚Äôm aware of (gallbladder removed 15 years ago due to stones and rupture).

The last several days I‚Äôve been unwell. I believe since from last Tuesday I experienced a few days of nausea and mild vomiting. By Thursday that had stopped, however I continued to have other symptoms like mild chest ache and thumping heartbeat (can hear/feel it in the ears too). I also have had regular lightheadedness, ringing in the ears which hasn‚Äôt stopped, dizziness, being caught in a ‚Äúdaze‚Äù that I‚Äôm aware of but seemingly unable to snap myself out of. Shortness of breath when I stand up, occasionally. Sweating excessively, primarily hands and feet, which feel cold. No fever to speak of. Muscle twitches/tremors - not an entire arm, for example, but a spot above the elbow, or a spot in the calf, etc will twitch at random for like five minutes. And the straight fatigue has been exhausting on its own. 

The last two days have been a little nerve racking and I thought maybe it‚Äôs because I hadn‚Äôt eaten much last week because I was nauseous. So over the weekend I really made an effort to eat but had low calorie but healthy foods - mainly bowls of berries, yogurt, and veggies. I noticed over a few days though that my bowel movements appeared as if the food was not digesting and contained very little if any bile/brown at all. It just looked like food covered in beige-brownish algae like flaky particles of scraps it scraped from the gut while passing. They were loose but not like a bile-ridden diarrhea is. It was basically like I described and would just, flake apart in the toilet bowl like it‚Äôs fucking fish food or something. 

Still, Saturday and Sunday continued with the weird head symptoms and I felt multiple times like I was either on the verge of fainting or having a seizure, or stuck in an aura like trance.

Today I probably had the biggest scare yet. My hands and feet would not stop sweating despite feeling freezing cold. I had no fever. This sensation of doom was closing in within my head, best I can describe it, a buzz and tingle I couldn‚Äôt stop from increasing, ringing in my ears drowning out sound, and I started losing peripheral vision and I just got to the ground and lay on my side fearing I was about to blackout or have a seizure, hoping not to choke myself on vomit if I did. I live alone so tried to hold my phone high enough that if I did, the impact of the fall would force an emergency call.

I literally slowly crawled around the house when I didn‚Äôt pass out right away because I continued to feel like this and when I stood up it felt like it almost for sure was going to happen.

I have eaten fruit and veggies today and had coffee, but in a last ditch effort I grabbed a bag of sourdough bread off the counter. It has zero sugar content. I just simply thought maybe I need more carbs like bread or something. It says high in iron on the bag and upon inspection of the label 2 slices is 25% DV. I ate like 7-8 slices. Over the last hour since I have been gradually feeling a little better but have developed a whole-head-wide headache.

What in gods name is going on? Thanks for any advice and help putting my mind at ease. ",2,1740431873.0,AskDocs,1,0.75,False

He bought the machine last summer, used it for a few weeks, and then life got in the way and it has sat idle until now.

He's trying to use it again and is not getting any water coming out of the group head/portafilter. He does, however, get steam and water out of the steam wand -- enough water coming out that he can confirm that the water level is going down in the reservoir, so the pump is indeed working.

I had thought that perhaps using the steam wand to prime the line for the boiler/group head would work on getting things moving, but he still can't get any water to come out.

He's tried the steam wand both before the boiler is hot and¬†after.

Is¬†it possible there is build-up clogging the solenoid valve even after just a few weeks usage? Would descaler work? How would the descaler get to where it needs to go if this is the case?

I live in a ski town. We only have 1 traffic light. As you can imagine with president's week, it is chaotic. I was attempting to get home on a backroad that lead to the main road in town. Between the snowbanks encroaching, the roads can get very tight. Specifically when turning from one to another. 

I come to this corner, and there is a van from New York at the stop sign. She doesn't move even when there is opportunity. I then come to realize she is waiting from someone to come to her car. I have no room to get around so I wait another 30 seconds. In that time, a boomer comes out and starts talking to her. Full blown coffee talk in the road as if nobody else exist. Cars wanting to turn on the road can't because of her and now there is a jam going both directions.

I beep my horn, she waves me off. Fuck the courtesy, I put my head out the window like Ace Venture and yell, ""you have to move, this isn't new york! Move!."" This old hag has a pathetic comeback loaded up with ""you sound like your from new york!"".......and continues to stand there as more cars start beeping from behind her. I respond with ""i know you think the world owes you something but it doesnt and you have to fucking move!"" Queue the cars behind her start yelling also to move.

1ixcyz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UndeadUnluck/comments/1ixcyz2/untime_concept/,UnTime concept,"In my opinion, time is linear progression. If something is timeless, then it negates linear progression. So if I call someone a timeless beauty, it means I think regardless of the progression of fashion/beauty standards, that person remains beautiful. Therefore, we must approach Time and its negation in this way. Breaking linearity. Thus we have Mani Kalika, our lovely negator.   Anyways, Kali can break the linearity of events but not the occurrence. This would still be consistent with fate-based predictions of UnTrust (that implies the future is somewhat scripted) while still having its own flavour.

UnTime

Self-targeting

Compulsory Activation whenever the user feels threatened. It will not de-activate until the threat is dealt with.

Ability: Upon activation, time freezes, though objects can still interact. In this state, the user is free to formulate a plan to negate the threat in some way. Upon the completion of this task, all of the progressions occur in a ""random"" order. Since there is no true random, a highly intelligent/long-time UnTime user can train to anticipate the order in which events will occur. While progressions occur, the user becomes functionally invincible (similar to UnTouchable but of a very small radius). However, if there is an object within the space of a progression, then the ability cancels, and she teleports to the point at which her ability is activated. The only consistent order in the progression is the first and last action.

Kali is making coffee when she senses she is in danger. She does not know why she is in danger.

1. She scans the room to look for any obvious signs of danger
2. She walks under her overhanging light fixture
3. She notices it has begun to crack and writes it down on a sticky note
4. She runs away to a nearby room
5. She puts on a hard hat

(Ability deactivates). This is what happens in real-time

3. She writes something down on a sticky note

1. She scans the room
2. She runs away
3. She walks under her light fixture
4. She puts on a hard hat

While she was in ""step 4,"" the light fixture over her head collapsed. When Step ""2"" is about to occur, it fails to take place (as she would have to clip through an object). Thus, she is teleported to her coffee station, though the same amount of time has passed. If the light fixture had only fallen during step 2, she would have been fine, thanks to her invincible state.

Tragedy:

When she saw her parents in danger, she performed the motions to save them: looking in shock, running towards them, staring at the seemingly ""frozen"" driver and moving them to a safe location. When real-time occurred, she instead stared at the driver, looked in shock, ran towards them and tried move them to a safe location. However, since the danger (say the truck) was already over their bodies, she was teleported back to the location when her ability was activated.

Motivation: She works as a thief, completing what should be impossible crimes. The target is stolen before the alarm is even triggered, thanks to her expert mastery over her negation. She plans out everything ensuring there is nothing missed or wrong in her plan. Because she believes her ability can be predicted if she just does MORE. Driven by perfection, she leaves behind cryptic clues in the scenes of her crime detailing EXACTLY why something was stolen, the plan and how she did it.

  
Etymology: Quite lazy of me but I chose the Norse and Hindu Gods of Time to make a passable name! Kalika is the Hindu God of time whilst M√°ni was technically a time-keeper of sorts due to his movements across the sky.",3,1740431114.0,UndeadUnluck,0,1.0,False

They invited more people and soon enough there was alcohol in the house. Me and my friends are turning 18 this year and most people at the party were older than us so it was completely legal. Im sure I saw Ann taking atleast nine shots and drinking something else too. It's not excusing anything but she was wasted. I was talking with some other people at like 11.50 pm when I saw Ann dancing to the the music with a guy. He is in our school and he is a year older than us. They were dancing prettyyy... closely like im talking her twerking on him them just rubbing on each other and basically dryhumping on the dancefloor (living room). I was pretty shocked and started recording them as evidence. I put my phone down and when I looked back up I saw them making out and doing some pretty nasty stuff. Im sure I liked like the weird one staring and recording them but I don't think it really matters Lmao. Later into the night when some people were leaving I saw Ann and the guy come out of a bathroom together and I have recordings of them walking out super wasted wobbling down the hallway. Now we jump to the morning I woke up in Jess's bed with Jess, Ann and Sam bc we decided to sleepover to help Jess clean in the morning. I was completely sober since I am underage and obvi wasn't drinking and so was Sam because she is 17 too but Jess was a little hungover and Ann looked like she crawled out of a cave after ten years of living in there and her eyes were still red. Me and Sam got up and made some coffee for us to drink while we say on the dirty living room floor sipping our coffees Ann liked at YS and said ""Do you guys remember...uhh if I umm"". ""You were dancing with one guy at our school"" I said. ""Oh no. F*ck"". Ann said as the memories started clearing in her head. ""Oh my gosh"" Sam gasped in shock as she realized. ""What about Kyle""! Jess screamed in shock. ""I don't know...I...I don't know. I can't tell him"" Ann mumbled. ""You have to"". I said in a very serious tone. ""I can't he will be so mad"" Ann answered and liked down at her coffee cup. This converstation lasted for hours of us drinking coffee and cleaning and then just talking about it. At the end Ann still didn't want to tell Kyle but I knew he deserved to know and I have the story and the evidence. This all happened last week on saturday and today on monday when im posting this I was talking with my other friendgroup and somehow Ann and the party were mentioned. None of them were there but they told me to Absolutely tell Kyle. Later on lunch I was Hanging With Sam and Jess and the four others and since they were there they asked about it because only me, Sam, Jess and Ann stayed the night as I already told but whatever. So we were contempleting on What Ann should do and majority said to be honest and tell Kyle but Ann refused to do that. After school Luke and I were next to his Car bc he always takes me home (I love him) and we were waiting for couple of his friends to come to the Car bc Luke was gonna drive then home too. He asked about the party and without thinking I blurted out everything that I saw and the fact that I have videos and that Ann doesn't wanna tell Kyle. He was shocked and said that if I didn't tell him he would, wich would be better in my openiin but like I was actually there and witnessed everything and if Luke told Kyle, he would still know Luke got the information from me. I don't know What to do. I want to tell Kyle but I also want to help my friend. It sounds bad but I need advice, also how would even bring that up to Kyle I can't just be like ""Hey your girlfriend who you trust and who you love cheated on you"" I don't know please help me out.",1,1740430741.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

I already do as much as I can like hiding my cats litter boxes and putting away their dish bowls and water bowls away.

And my baby is only 2 months old this week and she's barely recognizing and studying mine and my fianc√©'s faces. She can barely hold her heavy head up lol 

This last weekend though my niece was over again and she stumbled trying to stand up and hit her cheek on the corner of my coffee table. She was okay thankfully no open wounds, just a small red mark and lots of tears. Everyone blamed me for not having those corner things for sharp corners and I also felt guilty about it. I wasn't planning on baby proofing my home until my daughter was of crawling age but now I'm starting to think of doing it now. Now idk, am I in the wrong here? Should I baby proof now?

Wanted to start by saying yes, this was approved by admin üòé

I make custom laser engraved 3-layer anodized aluminum zyn style cans for your pouches. They have two storage areas, small storage up top for your dead/used pouches, and a main big storage below. Cans are available in Red, Blue, Black, and grey. 

Also, I now have a 2 piece can (top and bottom - same overall outside size) but these just have a single storage area. Much better for larger pouches (rogue, alp, velo, European zyn, coffee pouches, or regular chew pouches) or they do hold 2 full cans of zyn compared to the original can style. 

Just for this sub I‚Äôm offering 20% off on all orders with discount code Nicotine20 at checkout. You can use the discount code as many times as you would like since it‚Äôs specific for this subreddit or your friends. Just wanted to say thank you to yall as I find this sub informative when I‚Äôm looking for new stuff or info. Also I‚Äôm retired and love making cool designs and stuff! 

https://spartandesigns.com/discount/Nicotine20?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fspartan-cans

This link will take you directly to the products page and automatically input the discount code for 20% off for yall. 

You can also get to my website by going to SpartanCans.com

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I usually can get cans made my next business day and shipping is $4.99 unless you spend over $50 then it‚Äôs free shipping. I ship anywhere in the US and also I do Canada but no free shipping over the border as the new duties/taxes rates are a little bit more so shipping must be paid if you are in Canada. 

Anyways have a great day! üëçüòéüëç

1ixcrcy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixcrcy,Technical Analysis for Pi/USDT 2/24/25 - Intraday,"

Technical analysis of the Pi/USDT charts (1-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour) shown. 

Please remember this is not financial advice‚Äîalways do your own research and manage risk accordingly.



1. Price Action & Trend

Strong Intraday Rally: Building on our previous discussions, Pi/USDT has extended its bullish momentum across multiple timeframes, moving from around 1.40 to the 1.58‚Äì1.60 region. This ongoing uptrend reaffirms the positive bias noted earlier.

Current Price Zone:

1-Minute Chart: Shows quick fluctuations but maintains a series of higher lows up to 1.58‚Äì1.60.

30-Minute Chart: Clearly in an uptrend, with steady gains from the 1.40 area.

1-Hour Chart: Price consolidated briefly near 1.50 before pushing higher toward 1.60, indicating broader bullish strength.


Such consolidation or minor pullback near 1.55‚Äì1.59 is normal following a substantial rally.



2. Moving Averages / Bands

The colored bands on each timeframe (similar to moving average envelopes or Bollinger bands) indicate that price is near or slightly above the midline.

Upper Band Proximity: Trading near the upper band often signals short-term overbought conditions on the lower timeframes (1m, 30m).

Midline Support: A move back toward the midline could offer support or a retracement area if the rally takes a breather.





3. RSI (Relative Strength Index)

Across all three timeframes, the RSI appears to be in a moderately bullish range‚Äîgenerally 60‚Äì70.

Overbought Threshold: An RSI above 70 typically indicates overbought levels, which could lead to a short-term pullback.

Momentum Shift: A dip below 50 on any timeframe may suggest waning momentum and the potential for a deeper correction.





4. Volume

Volume spikes have accompanied much of the upward move (from about 1.40 to near 1.60).

Buying Volume on Dips: Elevated volume during minor pullbacks indicates strong bullish interest.

Volume Drop-Off: A noticeable decline in volume might suggest the rally is losing steam, prompting a possible consolidation or retracement.





5. Support & Resistance

Immediate Support: Around 1.50‚Äì1.55 appears to be a short-term support zone where buyers have recently stepped in on the 1-minute and 30-minute charts. If price falls below 1.50, look to 1.45 or 1.40 as deeper support levels (mentioned in earlier analyses).

Resistance: The recent peak near 1.60 serves as near-term resistance. A clean break above 1.60‚Äîespecially on strong volume‚Äîcould open the door for a move toward 1.65 or higher.





6. Short-Term Outlook

Bullish Bias: As long as price remains above 1.50, the short-term uptrend remains intact on all observed timeframes.

Potential Pullback: After a ~15‚Äì20% move, a healthy retracement is common. Watch RSI and price behavior around 1.50‚Äì1.55 to see if buyers step in again.





Key Takeaways

1. Momentum remains bullish, but be mindful of overbought conditions near the upper band‚Äîespecially on lower timeframes.


2. 1.50‚Äì1.55 is a critical short-term support‚Äîlosing that level could prompt a deeper pullback toward 1.45 or 1.40.


3. A breakout above 1.60 on strong volume may continue the uptrend toward 1.65+.



Always remember that technical indicators are probabilistic, not guarantees. Combine them with fundamental insights and prudent risk management when making trading decisions.

I will have this post in somewhat of a short ""quite to the point"" version. If you guys are interested in asking for more, I will build something *even* longer:

1. **XR, Extended Reality, is an umbrella term** for VR (Virtual Reality), MR (Mixed Reality), and AR (Augmented Reality)

1. Is XR in general worth it? It really boils down to what you want to experience. If you want something immersive, can ""hide yourself"", or simply ""take a break from the world"". Then it is 100% something you want to look into. Nothing beats driving your favourite cars in Froza Horizon, playing THE Batman in Batman, or interacting with the little ppl in your own MR room in Wall Town Wonders. Selfplug: I am building a game called ""In Wonder"", an MR game where you experience the coffee time/ nostalgia/ museum vibe. No objective, no rush, just life

1. **What can I do with VR?** Quite a lot of things, actually. You can always try the few ones first, and then slowly develop yourself over. The devs spend a lot of time building these creative/ passionate worlds. Don't be shy in offering your gratitude!!

   * Open world: Horizon Worlds, Gorilla Tag, Rodblox
   * Lifestyle: Tripp XR, In Wonder (coming soon!)
   * Workout: FitXR, Supernatural, VZ Fit, Kayak VR
   * Music: Beat Saber, Smash Drums
   * There are more, but let's save some for later...

1. **Transitioning from A device to B.** The current XR industry is shifting heavily from VR to MR. Most upcoming headsets might not support a fully immersed experience as it is really expensive. If you want a device that can do everything at a decently low price, go for Quest 3. It is so far the best choice overall. If you are looking for VR only and aren't too afraid of spending a thousand or so, Valve Index is definitely something that's worth trying out. But if you are on a budget, Quest 2 (you can only get this second-hand) can do most of the trick with around 100\~200 bucks. Everything else on the market is a ""nice to have, but not needed right now""

1. Last but not least. **Is VR dead?** The short answer is no, there will be more to come. The longer answer is, yes, because the companies are currently focused on MR now, so VR will take a toll. It will come back, but perhaps not as big as it previously was. The way how I see XR in general is that it feels like the ""early 2000 PC era"". Everything thinks the PCs are going to boom, but in reality, it never truly did. Macintosh was huge, then Windows XP, then foldable computers (laptops), then Linux (believe it or not, Linux was once a popular trend), then smartphones, etc etc etc (none of them are in order, I'm typing as I go). Eventually, we ended up with PCs everywhere without realizing that we were, in fact, buried in ""the boom"". I think XR is going to be something like that as well

So yeah! 5 things! Let me know what you think. I am an XR developer building an MR project called ""In Wonder"". I know a lot about the XR field and would love to answer anyone's questions! I will be posting a bit more if you guys like what I'm doing. Cheers, and have a great reality!",0,1740430590.0,oculus,0,0.5,False

I'm currently in month 3 of yet another flareup. I was on PPI's but docs recently switched me to Voquezna a couple weeks ago

Previously, I could get my acid problem under control with 3-4 months of avoiding all triggers (alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, citrus, tomatoes, carbonation, fried foods) and as long as I didn't go overboard with the triggers later, I could enjoy the occasional decaf coffee or fried food when I was feeling alright. My attacks have never been related to overconsuming triggers, I'm not sure yet why I get them. 

I'm currently suffering from another attack, on about month 3 of trying to heal, and I've noticed a weird trend: SAFE FOODS are giving me heartburn, but trigger foods aren't.

For example, last night I said ""fuck it"" and ate two slices of supreme pizza, fully ready to feel like I was dying. And I felt fine all night! I was shocked. (I did drink a smoothie with aloe vera beforehand to coat my stomach, so maybe that just worked really well?)

meanwhile earlier in the week, I ate a veggie sandwich (bread, cucumbers, carrots, avocado, black olives) and I had heartburn for the rest of the day. Today I had a lunch of chicken, rice, and blanched veggies, and 30 minutes later I have that familiar cold burn in my throat. And most days I start my morning with oatmeal and banana, but like clockwork about an hour later I have heartburn that is only quelled by lunch. 

Now I'm recalling a time a month ago, when exasperated that no meds or safe meals were working so ""what was the point?"" and I went and got a smash burger and fries -- and I felt fine that night. 

  
So now I'm very confused because it seems like eating triggers foods makes me not have heartburn, but eating vegetables and healthy foods IS giving me reflux -- or something else about those meals is causing the reflux on a near constant basis. Could it be the stress of eating ""safe"" foods all the time?

1ixcmuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ixcmuv/whats_the_situation_right_now/,What's the situation right now?,"I really like this girl I study with at university and we used to have long eye contact and regularly smiled to each other in class, but recently she hasn't been initiating any of this anymore and I really wonder what the situation is now, especially after an interaction I had on the bus today.

I actually talked to her a few times, so we know each other, but we're not really friends and considering she's stunning, both personality & looks wise, whereas I'm very average, I thought she was just friendly all the time, so I didn't ever ask her out or anything. 

Now lately I've been thinking about our interactions and when I sum everything up in my head, I want to slap myself in the face, bc I feel there might have been something and now I do wonder if she might actually feel the same way about me, so I thought I'm just going to ask her for some coffee together. 

Today a classmate asked me if I was looking at someone in the lecture hall and I foolishly told him yes, but didn't mention her. Later on the bus I was talking with one of my crush's friends and my classmate mentioned out loud that he wanted me to tell me who I liked, so I told him I wasn't going to tell him, but she'd probably not be interested in me bc she's awesome. 

And this friend actually started grinning and giving me a playful look (she knows I wasn't talking about her as she has a bf) and I think she might know I like my crush, bc she gave me that exact same look when she once saw me looking at my crush.

She didn't mention anything like oh I think she does like you or anything like that, so I don't know what I should make of this, especially since I haven't had any eye contact/conversations with my crush at all last week, so I just wonder if should ask her for coffee anyway (as it might be a bit out of the blue by now), or if I should see if her behaviour towards me changes (I haven't made a move in 2 months), considering this friend of her might tell her if she links my 'hint'.

Most importanly, does this interaction tell me something useful?",2,1740430295.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

What the fuck am I doing here? Why the fuck am I trying to live, I‚Äôm not good at it. Retirement cannot start soon enough.

If I move back I keep my job (working remotely) and will be able to save about 70% of my salary (vs 0% here) cause it‚Äôs very cheap there. I hate the town though and its residents. I‚Äôve been robbed thrice there in 6 years and injured for life twice, havent‚Äô met a single interesting and decent person. I‚Äôm insulted there constantly cause everyone's nose is in everyones business, people are so miserable in this middle of nowhere they constantly looking for a scapegoat to air their frustrations. I can‚Äôt even go to a coffee shop or a grocery store without retail employees gossiping and laughing and writing insults in my latte or refusing to service me or male retail workers dodging me cause they feel small and insignificant like they def chose a wrong turn in life since they have to service an ugly woman. ¬†I remember first when I moved to the city I was so shocked that cashiers are nice lol (not all, but many). I figure I‚Äôd need a 1,5 years to save for plastic surgery and brackets and then I can move back to my favorite city.

It would be like temporary death though. What if I don‚Äôt survive, lose my identity or smth? No more people to tell me how cool I am, no more my favorite hobbies and interesting conversations and watching social dynamics unravel when smart or decent girls protect me from mean ones, it‚Äôs like Brave Heart‚Äôs armies clashing in front of me in 4k. And I felt like a grandiose manipulator just for exposing shite lookist people while pretending I‚Äôm doing smth else. Like someone wanted to kick me from the group cause they don‚Äôt like my face and they got support just for being pretty even though totally wrong in their actions and I forced myself to be bubbly and pretend to have fun while subtly reminding them what kind of shite they‚Äôre, now it‚Äôs them missing 80% of meetups and me getting along with most of the members. It was so fun and justice warrior-y. I‚Äôll be completely isolated in my old town.

Also rent is already twice is higher here so moving back can be tricky. What if my face after surgery won‚Äôt improve my job chances and overall mental health?

1ixck6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ixck6i/whats_messing_with_me/,What‚Äôs messing with me?,"Okay so throughout my whole life, I‚Äôve had a lot of paranormal experiences in pretty much every house I‚Äôve ever lived in. I used to move a lot and didn‚Äôt stay in one place for more than a couple of years.

The house I‚Äôm in now is where I‚Äôve lived for almost 8 years and is also the only house I‚Äôve never had any kind of experiences in. Until recently. 

I‚Äôm autistic and so extremely pedantic about things being exactly how I want them. I have two coasters on my coffee table and I have them at a very particular angle and if they‚Äôre moved even a couple of cm, I will notice. The last couple of weeks, they have been moved almost every day. Sometimes multiple times a day. When I come down in the morning, if I leave the room and come back. Sometimes they‚Äôve been moved while I‚Äôm sitting right next to them. I‚Äôll be watching TV and after a while I‚Äôll happen to look over and they‚Äôve moved. 

Tonight, I was sitting watching TV. Coasters were in their rightful place. Got up to make dinner. Came back. Still in the same place. When I was eating dinner, my cat was in the kitchen and she suddenly sat bolt upright, ears back and was staring into the living room. I looked in but couldn‚Äôt see anything so assumed a car outside had spooked her or something. Went upstairs for a shower. Came back down to watch a little TV and one of the coasters had not only moved angle but was completely upside down. (Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, oh it was the cat. The table is really small and she doesn‚Äôt  jump onto it because the one time she did, she fell off so she‚Äôs scared of it now lol). 

Then I remembered that this afternoon, I cleaned the bathroom. Did the sink first. Set everything back down on it. Cleaned everything else. Left. Came back to make sure everything was clean. It was. Went downstairs to grab something and realised I‚Äôd left some stuff in the bathroom and when I went back in, there was hand soap all over the sink. As if someone had just started pumping it but directly into the basin. I‚Äôd understand if I‚Äôd accidentally pressed it while cleaning but the soap was sat on the edge of the sink for at least 30 minutes just fine while I was cleaning in there. So I know it wasn‚Äôt me. And you have to physically pump it to get the soap out.

I always assumed my ‚Äúhauntings‚Äù were over. I‚Äôve dealt with weird stuff since I was a kid and this is the only place I‚Äôve not had anything weird happen and I‚Äôve been here a long time now. Is it possible that something has been here all along and just couldn‚Äôt be bothered doing anything for 8 years? Or maybe something has travelled to the house with me?

I only ask the second question because my best friend believes she has a ghost. She even caught it on camera pulling her bedroom door shut. A few of her family members claim to have seen the shadow of a man walking inside her house. Every time I go over there, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI really wanna see your ghost‚Äù and now I‚Äôm wondering if he‚Äôs followed me here lol. He‚Äôs not a bad ghost. My friend says he just kinda moves stuff around the house and generally just seems annoyed she‚Äôs in his house but never does anything bad or creepy.

This is the first time I‚Äôm really focusing on the design of spaces like the living room.

I‚Äôve got a corner couch and plan to add a coffee table, TV unit, and a 55"" TV. I‚Äôd love your thoughts on whether what I have in mind will work, especially in terms of modern aesthetics.

One issue I‚Äôm facing is that the TV is too big to fit on the wall, so I thought a TV unit to hold the TV would be the best option. The thing is, I can‚Äôt position the unit directly against the wall, and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs unusual. Most of the designs I‚Äôve seen online place the TV unit against the wall. My partner and I need to be able to walk behind the TV to access the closet without blocking it.

I‚Äôm a bit concerned, though, that the horizontal line of the TV might clash with the angled surface nearby and create a distracting visual element.

What do you all think? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I added three images to show what I am talking about.

A the same time, I can't really increase dosage because I'm already using body weight to get the shot to tamp and for it to fit within the portafilter. The puck screen takes up some depth within the portafilter, so I don't think I can get any more beans in there.

1ixcefx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1ixcefx/in_case_its_useful_heres_my_experience/,"In case it's useful, here's my experience interviewing for a role with Microsoft in the Azure Customer Experience (CXP) team","I had [a few questions last week about interviewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1it8wze/question_about_interviewing_for_azure_senior/) for an open Senior Advanced Cloud Engineer role with Azure.  Thanks to the folks who responded and some research I did based on those responses, and a few extremely helpful folks who PMed me with some more detail, I went into the interviews fairly confident.  

I wanted to share my experience so far (no decision from MS yet, but here's hoping) in case it's helpful to others who are interviewing for Azure CXP roles.  My case is a bit interesting since I applied for the role, got rejected, but then had a contact refer me to the same role which kicked off the process.  It's down by dates to hopefully help illustrate the process so people know what to expect.  Disclaimer: I have never worked in the tech industry, I've just been in IT across various industries.  Worked my way up from helpdesk to desktop support to sysadmin to Azure over the years.  I am not a dev, I have never really pursued a job in the tech industry, so YMMV and my experience may be very different.

tl;dr: do your prep, do the prep, **do the prep.** 

**Read the JD**, make sure you know what is in it, but know a bit about other things that might come in to play.  If a cert is on the JD, and if you have that cert, make sure you know the stuff well enough to not be a paper tiger.  

**Utilize your network** \- if you have a TAM/CSAM/buddy in Microsoft/decent person you worked with on a support issue, be in a good enough spot to add them on Linkedin and be nice to them.      

**Be prepared for very meaningfully asked ""tell me about when you did X"" or ""tell me how you would handle Y"" behavioral questions.**  They're not just parroting off a list and reading for your keywords.  You'll be engaged in this stuff.  Be able to speak to things and to speak well.  It's very conversational, surprisingly fair.  

Above all, ***expect delays.***  I'm not sure if it normally takes a while, but my experience started in early December and is continuing through late February.  Maybe other roles don't have the same thing, but it never hurts to come in expecting a while and to check in after a week or so at each step.

**12/2/24**: Reached out to a contact I had at MS about the open position.  She asked for some details for a referral hire.  Sent 'em, didn't hear back for a bit.

**12/5/24**: Submitted the application.   

**12/13/24**: Got a rejection email for the position.

**1/8/25**: The contact I reached out to finally got back to me.  She'd been OOO, but she apparently reached out to the manager, they really wanted to talk.  I told her I'd been rejected already but was happy to move forward.  The contact sent me a referral application invite for the rejected role.  I completed it. 

**1/15/25**: Got an email from a recruiter asking for some further details.  Other than some of the basics, I was asked what I'd worked on at a very high level.  I mentioned the projects I'd done in Azure and gave a bulleted list of the Azure services they used which were mentioned in the job posting.  

**1/26/25**: I followed up via email with the recruiter.  

**1/29/25**: The recruiter responded and said we'd be moving forward, asking for some dates/times for a first round technical screener.  I gave my upcoming availability for the next four days and offered to give further dates if needed.

**2/3/25**: I emailed the recruiter again to follow up.  They responded, we scheduled the screener for the next day. 

**2/4/25**: The screener happened.  It was with an MS employee (not a v- email, for what it's worth).  He asked a few question about what projects I had worked on in Azure, then we did the technical screening questions.  They were almost entirely focused on load balancing and PaaS services - mostly example issues about how I would accomplish X type of load balancing, the difference between layer 4 and layer 7 LBs, being able to distinguish between regional and global LB services, etc.  I hadn't worked as extensively with load balancing as I have with other services, so I fell back on what I remembered from studying for the AZ-305 and AZ-104 exams, along with some work I'd done in a previous job that touched on load balancers.  

The interviewer followed up on a few of my points and thoughts in the process, mostly to ensure I had a rough idea of what I was talking about in things like SSL offloading, how to configure a health check, how I'd integrate Service Health or Azure Monitor into monitoring an LB or service, etc.  

I honestly thought I didn't do so well - like I said, I'm not exactly the king of load balancers and it wasn't that huge in the JD, but I did get plenty of time and opportunity to explain and clarify my thinking, how I'd dig up more details, what I'd have as an interim solution while we worked on other parts, etc.  The screener was definitely knowledgable about the questions, he wasn't just asking from a checklist.  They were all very fair questions, just challenging to me.  

I had around 15 minutes towards the end to ask questions.  I don't recall what I asked, but most of them were me following up on what types of resources were behind the LBs and if the clients tended to prefer a standard LB resource (e.g. do they like Application Gateway for VM scale set applications, Front Door for Function Apps, etc.) and whether we had our own monitoring in place as part of proactively responding to client issues.  I had a few of the usual questions I ask interviewers as well.  YMMV, but do come with questions.

**2/7/25**: I sent a thank-you email to the interviewer and recruiter.  Nothing too huge, just a note and a quick ""I'm excited for the opportunity to etc. etc., I'd love to see where things go"". 

**2/14/25**: The recruiter emailed me to say that things were moving forward to interviews and that I'd be hearing from a scheduler as well as getting a separate request to fill out an NDA.  The recruiter sent along a package of details: links to interview tips, how to prep for the virtual interviews, what to expect, the STAR-R format, and lots of other useful details.  

They also mentioned it'd be four interviews, one hour each, and that I could schedule them as best fit my comfort level and the interviewers' availability.

I completed the NDA and the scheduler reached out within a couple of hours.  They asked for time windows over two specific calendar days the following week.  I provided time windows and received calendar invites for all four rounds.  

**2/20/25:** Day 1, rounds 1 and 2.  

Round 1: I believe it was with the manager for the role.  They focused mostly on what the role looked like, how the CXP team had evolved over time, etc.  Her questions to me were mostly focused on handling projects, incidents, guiding clients through and demonstrating POCs.  Some of the questions I can recall: ""tell me about when you had to work on something that was completely new to you and how you solved it"", ""tell me about the last time you had to take an issue through higher levels of support/engineering"", etc.  I kept to STAR-R and it seemed like that worked fairly well.

I was asked about what DEI meant to me.  I'm pretty passionate about uplifting people's skill sets, being sensitive to different backgrounds and ensuring that what I work on, document, etc. is accessible.  I had a few examples about how I'd worked with a C-level equity officer at my current role that helped illustrate that I cared about it and what I did to improve a technical situation while working with them.  I won't go too deep into the 2025-era political hellscape of DEI and people's thinking over it, other than I think it's a positive thing and I was able to speak about it from knowledge and experience.  Be an empathic human being, think about being better to people in worse situations, and you should be OK.

One question that stood out to me was ""Let's say it's your one-year anniversary, we're having a coffee and looking back on the first year - what would you say made it successful?""  This is a turnaround of a question I almost always ask at interviews: ""Let's say everything works out well and I start out, complete onboarding, meet the team, and am ready to go.  What would you think is a good skill for me to begin learning or teaching myself that helps me show my value?""  Without going into details that might not be relevant to others, I was able to pivot pretty quick and talk about the technical and soft skills I'd be honing in the role, and how I had some intangibles based on my background that would help.

My questions to the manager: ""what changed in the team as it went through these different evolutions and phases?"", ""do we have a metric that we use to demonstrate client nimbleness?"", ""what kind of KPIs, metrics, or goals do you use to evaluate success?"", ""how has the team structure changed with the post-COVID layoffs?""  

Round 2: this was with a different manager in a technical role, I think it was a colleague or similar senior technical person in CXP.  He asked me what areas of Azure I felt I was an expert in, and that he'd focus his questions on those.  I gave my personal areas of expertise and we worked through scenarios related to them: ""Company X has Resource Y which is doing Thing.  It should not be doing Thing.  How would you approach it?"" and the like.  Without going into verbatim from the scenarios, they were accurate and meaningful scenarios that gauged my ability to ask clarifying questions, how I would gather details using Azure and other resources available, what actions I would take, etc.  STAR-R was great for providing real-world examples or related situations that I wanted to use to show what I'd done in the past or how I would approach something like the scenario in question.  

We had about 3 or 4 of these scenarios total, all of which covered areas that I'd said I felt qualified.  **Know your details and don't BS.**  He followed up on a few of my points and details asking why I'd pick that, or where I'd look for it, and if I was BSing I'd have been exposed pretty quickly.  This technical round was with someone who knew what he was interviewing about.  

My questions to the interviewer: ""how do members of CXP get assigned to or choose what they're experts in?"", ""how do we expand what these skills or develop new skills as client needs come up/our professional scope expands?"", ""does the team tend to collaborate their respective Azure technical area expertise to other team members or is it mostly one person doing research for their client?  e.g. 'This is Jane, she's our Azure ML expert, she'll be helping us out with this project'""  

**2/21/25**: Day 2, rounds 3 and 4: other managers within CXP.  More of the same behavioral-style questions as in round 1, but focused on parts of the CXP role itself.  ""Tell me about the last time you had to act as an incident commander or were responsible for seeing a sev 1/sev A incident through, and what it led to afterwards,"" ""how do you handle a senior executive with a client when they're extremely unhappy with normal support channels,"" ""have you ever worked with an engineering team to deliver a fix based upon an incident,"" things like that.  

One point that prospective candidates should know - **prepping for the STAR-R format and reading the interview prep notes helped.**  One interviewer said he had to check if I had previously worked for Microsoft before since I apparently sounded like an employee given how I'd addressed the questions.  It helped to know how all the Azure services worked together and how a client might utilize them.  ""Inch deep, mile wide"" is a good starting point - if I was doing nothing but Function Apps and one or two other services, it wouldn't have worked out for this role.  Others might vary but it definitely felt like they appreciated someone whose answers were ""in situation X, we'd have to figure out what exactly Y is doing based on Azure Service Z.  We'd have to take a few tasks -at the start we'd need to write code for A, then set it up in Function App B to call blob container C.  This would give us the details we need to understand the logs from Service Z and create tasks to fix the code running in A, after which we can follow up on the metrics to determine if we need to deploy it to production.  I could see this leading to Change in Process Q down the line.""  

**2/24/25:** Wrote this up for future seekers and moved on with my job and day while waiting for the word.  I'll be pinging them again this coming Thursday to see what's up.

We both sell trees, but Jake does it more seriously since he‚Äôs retired, and I just do it on the side.

A while back, there was a dispute between a buyer (Mary) and a seller. Jake stepped in and sided with the seller. Mary accused Jake of being racist/sexist (for the record, I‚Äôve never seen any behavior like that from him). Jake told me about the whole situation in a Facebook message, but he never said it was private. This all played out publicly in the forum too, and in the end, Jake banned Mary from the group.

Fast forward a year. Mary messages me out of the blue and asks if I can talk to Jake about unbanning her. I screenshot her message and send it to Jake with a quick note. He reiterates what happened but ultimately decides to unban her. I let her know, and she then asks me why she was banned in the first place.

I figured just replacing the water with grapefruit juice would get both in one (https://classicbells.com/soap/citricAcid.asp), but I like to dilute my soap down to 5-10% and use a foaming dispenser, so I'm thinking I'd need to strain the juice really well through a coffee filter or something. Has anyone tried anything like this and have any tips?

I'm also not set on my oils. I want a nice dense foam from the dispenser, I would really like to be able to use it as a shampoo as well as hand and body wash, and I couldn't care less if it's clear or not, and I don't plan to add any fragrance. The recipe I've used so far is 70% olive oil, 20% castor, and 10% coconut, and it's ok, but it could lather better, and I tried it once in my hair and it made my hair feel thick and kinda crusty so I didn't do that again lol.

I got a recipe from ai (I ran it through soapcalc and the lye was off, don't trust an ai for a good lye amount) that was close to what I was thinking about trying:

* 250g coconut oil (\~33%)
* 200g olive oil (\~27%)
* 150g castor oil (20%)
* 100g sunflower oil (\~13%)
* 50g shea butter (\~7%)

Would this be good, or could the shea butter clog my foaming dispensers? Any other recipe ideas given the above constraints? (i.e. dense foam from dispenser, shampoo/hand/body soap, no additives after saponification, sugar + citric acid before saponification either as pure additives or as citrus juice)

I've also seen sulfated castor oil used to superfat liquid soap for shampoo, so I was considering doing that if needed, but I'd rather keep it simple and do all the mixing before saponification, and only worry about diluting after",1,1740429521.0,soapmaking,2,1.0,False

I(30) have just ended things with a woman (38)  I was in a relationship with.
We have only been in a relationship a month. I asked her on a date and the next day (before the date) she called me her girlfriend. Yes I should have voiced my opinion on that and take responsibility for not. We'd agreed to go slow otherwise.
We've only been on one date in the month, that I organised. We went to a pub quiz as a group that I organised and other than that we have only seen each other at her work (local pub) whilst she is working or whilst she's not working, but others around regardless. I have suggested organising dates and nothing came of it. 
Since Thursday there have been a couple of conversations that have made me realise that sadly, we just aren't compatible. I'm very black and white like that, as lovely as someone can be, if you can't provide the relationship style someone wants, needs and deserves, then in my opinion it's best to end it before things go further. Before more feelings develop and the harder things become. I don't believe either of us should have to compromise or change, we just aren't each other's 'person' and that's okay. 

We spoke at the beginning, the night I asked her out and a few times afterwards that IF things didn't work out, we would remain friends as we were before and neither of us should feel uncomfortable. 
I wanted to go get coffee tomorrow to talk, we've only seen each other 1:1 once in the last month. Tonight she asked me if we were okay so I said could we talk tomorrow in person (I didn't want to lie and say yes we were) and suggested a place to meet. She asked me if I was ended things to just tell her. 
I explained that I didn't want to over message as to me that wasn't fair, but that I had been thinking and feeling things and wanted to meet in person to discuss etc. She then said meeting would be harder and she knew something was wrong because it was weird the last 2 weeks. 
She asked me if she'd done something. 
I sent back what I thought was a nice message saying that, the last two weeks in my opinion have been good and it was only the last 3 days I have been thinking about things. That i was sorry that over the last 2 weeks she had that anxiety, I didn't realise and was sorry. I explained once back from shopping I'd sit down and type a message explaining, and that I didn't want to cause hurt. Stating she hadn't done anything wrong and she was a wonderful person.
She responded with a tone (message tone) I hadn't seen coming saying: the last 2 weeks haven't beacuse that's when I started changing. That she didn't know what to say and if this is how I'd been feeling for the last 3 days why didn't i mention anything? (I did say yesterday that I'd like to talk but my dad was here and I'm not on my phone when i spend days with him, the day before she was hungover and napping for most of it) And if this is the case why did I want to ask her out and she hoped I'd have given this more of a chance.  
I just feel so overly awful. I didn't want to cause upset. That's never ny intention. It was only a month I didn't think it would be like this given our ages and time length. ",1,1740429434.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

You‚Äôve got biceps that could rival the Incredible Hulk and abs that would make anyone weak in the knees. But wait, what about your grip strength?

Yes, my friend, grip strength is just as important in fitness as those bulging muscles. And having the right grip strength tools is as necessary as the right beer.

Think about it ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre lifting weights, doing pull-ups, or even carrying grocery bags (because we all know how intense that can be), it‚Äôs your grip that holds everything together. Without strong hands and forearms, you might find yourself dropping weights on unsuspecting toes or losing control of those precious dumbbells.

Enter the king of all exercises for grip strength: short steel bending. This exercise may sound intimidating (and, let‚Äôs be honest, a little bit crazy), but it‚Äôs actually an incredibly effective way to strengthen your hands and forearms.

Now, we know what you‚Äôre thinking. ‚ÄúShort steel bending? That sounds a bit intense!‚Äù

And yes, my friends, it is intense. But fear not! We‚Äôll guide you through this thrilling journey with a healthy dose of humor and some killer tips along the way.

**Get a Grip: Introducing Short Steel Bending**

Short steel bending involves gripping a short piece of steel with both hands and attempting to bend it into various shapes. It requires not only brute strength but also precision and control. And trust us ‚Äì once you start incorporating¬†short steel bending¬†into your fitness routine, you‚Äôll notice a world of difference in your grip strength.

So why is grip strength so important? Well, aside from preventing embarrassing weight-dropping incidents at the gym (we‚Äôve all been there), having a strong grip has numerous benefits. For starters, it allows you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps without fatiguing as quickly.

Additionally, improving your grip strength can lead to better overall athletic performance. Whether you‚Äôre swinging a golf club or throwing punches in boxing class, having a rock-solid grasp on whatever equipment or opponent comes your way can give you an edge over the competition.

Not convinced yet? Consider this: studies have shown that¬†[individuals with stronger grips](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/myacare.com/blog/the-importance-of-grip-strength-as-we-age)¬†tend to live longer lives! So, if longevity is one of your fitness goals, then it‚Äôs time to start focusing on that grip strength.

All of this sounds great, but what makes short steel bending the KING of all grip-strength equipment? That‚Äôs up next.

**1. Warning: May Cause Uncontrollable Grunting and Spontaneous Manly Poses ‚Äì A Comparison of Grip Exercises**

When it comes to grip strength exercises, there are plenty of options out there. From dumbbell exercises to grip strengtheners, the possibilities seem endless. But let us tell you why short steel bending reigns supreme in the realm of grip workouts!

**Dumbbell Exercises**

Sure, dumbbell exercises are great for building overall strength, but for targeting your grip specifically? Not so much. Short steel bending puts all the focus on those hand muscles and really gives them a run for their money.

**Fancy (AKA Expensive) Grip Strengtheners**

And what about fancy grip-strength equipment? While they may look impressive sitting on your desk or coffee table, do they really get the job done?

Short steel bending takes things up a notch by challenging not only your grip strength but also your endurance. It‚Äôs like a two-for-one deal!

**Pull-Up Variations**

Pull-ups are fantastic for building upper body strength, but short steel bending is where it‚Äôs at if you want to take your grip game to the next level. Say goodbye to wimpy forearms and hello to Popeye-like power!

**2. Forearm Fury: Unleash the Power of Thor (Minus the Hammer and the Lightning)**

If you‚Äôve ever struggled to open a stubborn jar or hold onto a heavy weight, chances are your grip strength could use some work. But did you know that the muscles in your lower arm play a huge role in determining just how strong your grip is?

It‚Äôs true! Those little muscles can have a big impact on your ability to grasp and hold onto things.

These muscles often go unnoticed until you try to open a stubborn jar of pickles or attempt to crack open a walnut with your bare hands. But, don‚Äôt worry; we know the best forearm workouts to turn those feeble forearms into sculpted powerhouses!

Picture this: you‚Äôre at the gym, surrounded by people pumping iron and flexing their biceps like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. Meanwhile, you‚Äôre over in the corner, quietly working on your lower arm strength like a secret superhero training for their next mission. And let me tell you, it‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds.

You see, building lower arm strength requires dedication and focus. It‚Äôs all about targeting those specific muscles that are responsible for gripping and holding onto things for dear life (or just everyday tasks). But don‚Äôt worry; short steel bending has got your back (and forearms) covered.

With each bend of that trusty piece of metal in your hand, you‚Äôll be engaging muscles in your wrists and forearms that rarely get any love from traditional exercises. And let me tell you when those muscles start to grow stronger‚Ä¶well, let‚Äôs just say opening jars will become child‚Äôs play.

**How the Muscles in Your Lower Arm Impact Grip**

The¬†[anatomy of grip](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/anatomy-of-grip)¬†doesn‚Äôt just exist within your hands. Forearm exercises help strengthen your grip. The fact that short steel bending can target these muscles makes it even better, but how do these muscles impact grip?

Let‚Äôs start with the forearm flexors. These are the powerhouse muscles responsible for gripping and squeezing objects.

They‚Äôre like the Hulk of your lower arm, ready to smash anything that comes their way. With stronger forearm flexors, you‚Äôll be able to crush cans and squeeze oranges like nobody‚Äôs business!

Next up are the extensor muscles. These bad boys help keep your wrist stable and assist in opening your hand after a tight grip.

Think of them as the Batman to your forearm flexor‚Äôs Hulk. They swoop in when it‚Äôs time to release that death grip on the doorknob or let go of those bags of groceries without dropping everything.

Then we have the pronator teres muscle, which helps rotate your forearm so you can turn doorknobs or twist off bottle caps with ease. It may not be as flashy as its counterparts, but trust us, this muscle is essential for everyday tasks that require twisting motions.

Don‚Äôt forget about our friend, the brachioradialis muscle! This sneaky little guy runs along the outer edge of our forearms and plays a crucial role in stabilizing our wrists during gripping activities. Without it, we‚Äôd be wobbling around like girls mud wrestling and trying to hold onto anything.

Last but certainly not least is our old pal, the wrist flexor group. Made up of several small but mighty muscles, these guys provide stability and control during gripping exercises while also contributing to overall wrist strength.

**3.¬†Beef Up Your Wrist Tendons**

Have you ever tried to open a stubborn jar lid, only to have your weak wrist give out and leave you defeated? It‚Äôs a frustrating feeling, isn‚Äôt it? The tendons in your wrist play an integral role here.

Think of muscles as the rock stars of your body, strutting their stuff on stage (the gym). But they wouldn‚Äôt be belting out those reps without their trusty backup band, the tendons!

Tendons are like the cables that hold everything together in your body. They connect muscles to bones and allow for smooth movement. So, if your tendons are weak, it‚Äôs like having frayed cables that can snap at any moment.

By incorporating short steel bending into your workout routine, you‚Äôll be giving those tendons in your wrist a serious workout. Just imagine them getting stronger with every bend of the steel! Soon enough, opening jars will become child‚Äôs play for you.

Strengthening¬†[the tendons](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21738-tendon)¬†in your wrist also has other benefits beyond just grip strength. It can help prevent injuries and improve overall flexibility in your hand and wrist joints.

With short steel bending exercises as part of your fitness regimen, you‚Äôll never have to worry about struggling with everyday tasks again.

And who knows? Maybe one day someone will challenge you to an arm wrestling match‚Ä¶and thanks to those strong tendons in your wrists, victory will be yours!

**4. One-Stop Muscle Shop: Sculpt Chest, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, and Abs in One Fell Swoop**

This isn‚Äôt just exercises for forearms. Your biceps are muscles that have inspired countless shirtless selfies and flexing photo ops. We all want those bulging biceps that scream, ‚ÄúI pump iron!‚Äù

But did you know that short steel bending can actually help you achieve those swole arms? That‚Äôs right, folks; this grip strength exercise works wonders for your hands and strengthens your shoulders, chest, triceps, abdominal muscles, and, of course, your beloved biceps.

Let‚Äôs start with the shoulders. When you engage in short steel bending exercises, you‚Äôre not just working on gripping power ‚Äì oh no!

You‚Äôre also giving those deltoids a run for their money. Imagine having well-defined shoulder muscles to complement your chiseled arms. Talk about an impressive upper body!

And what about the chest? Short steel bending is like hitting two birds with one stone (figuratively speaking). While you focus on improving your grip strength, you‚Äôre also activating those pectoral muscles in ways they‚Äôve never experienced before.

Now, let‚Äôs give some love to our favorite muscle group ‚Äì the biceps! Short steel bending puts these bad boys into overdrive as they work hard to help control the movement of your wrists and forearms during each bend.

Next are the triceps, those muscles on the back of your upper arm that make your arms look toned and impressive. Well, they also contribute to a strong grip. Think about it: when you‚Äôre squeezing something tightly, like a¬†short steel bar, those triceps are firing up to help stabilize your elbow joint and maintain that powerful grip.

Finally, let‚Äôs move down to the abs, the powerhouse of your core! Engaging your core muscles during short steel bending exercises provides stability for better control over the movement and enhances overall strength throughout your body. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt want killer abs while improving their grip?

Let‚Äôs get a grip on this and discuss the role of each of these muscle groups and your grip.

**The Shoulders and Grip**

Think of your shoulders as the power station for your arms. They‚Äôre the guys behind the scenes pumping the juice that lets you crush watermelons with your pinkie and hold grocery bags that would make an ox weep.

Strong shoulders provide a solid foundation for generating force through the arms and into the hands, allowing you to maintain a firm grip on objects. Whether you‚Äôre lifting heavy weights or performing everyday tasks requiring strong grip strength, having well-developed shoulder muscles will contribute to your success.

Weak shoulders? More like floppy fish arms and handshakes like wet noodles.¬†Short steel bending¬†is like a gym for your shoulders, turning them into granite fortresses for your puny biceps.

By targeting all aspects of grip strength with short steel bending exercises ‚Äì including wrist flexion/extension, forearm pronation/supination, and finger abduction/adduction ‚Äì you‚Äôll not only build impressive forearm muscle definition but also develop robust¬†[shoulder muscles](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/www.arrowptseattle.com/news/grip)¬†that are essential for maintaining a powerful grasp.

Soon, you‚Äôll open pickle jars with a wink and flip pancakes like a griddle boss. Plus, it beats those boring shoulder shrugs in the gym that make you look like a confused flamingo.

Trust us, your shoulders will thank you (and your wrists and forearms will be super impressive).

Strengthening the shoulders helps prevent injuries when performing grip-intensive activities. Weak or unstable shoulders can lead to imbalances and compensations throughout the upper body, which may increase the risk of strains or sprains in the wrists and forearms.

**The Chest and Grip**

When it comes to¬†[grip strength](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/integrehab.com/blog/strength-and-conditioning/upper-body-strength/), most people don‚Äôt immediately think of their chest muscles. But let me tell you, having a strong chest can really give your grip some serious power!

Just imagine squeezing a piece of coal and turning it into a diamond with the sheer force of your grip‚Ä¶ Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea!

So, how does the chest come into play? Well, think about it ‚Äì when you‚Äôre bench pressing or doing push-ups, your hands are gripping onto those weights or the floor for dear life.

Your chest muscles are working hard to stabilize your arms and keep everything in line. And guess what? That constant tension on your hands translates to increased grip strength!

Not only will strengthening your chest help improve your grip strength, but it can also lead to better overall upper body strength.

So not only will you have an iron-like grip, but you‚Äôll also have pecs that could rival Superman‚Äôs! Just be careful not to flex too hard at parties ‚Äì no one likes ripped shirt seams (except maybe the ladies).

A strong chest also means better posture and stability in movements like carrying heavy objects or pushing/pulling exercises.

**The Biceps and Grip**

When it comes to showing off those guns, the biceps are the star of the show. But they also play a crucial role in grip strength.

Strong biceps provide stability and power to your grip. Think about it: when you‚Äôre squeezing something with all your might, like trying to open a stubborn jar or hanging from a ledge by your fingertips (hopefully not too often), it‚Äôs your biceps that kick into action to keep everything locked and loaded.

[Your biceps](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/www.verywellhealth.com/biceps-anatomy-4688616)¬†also work in tandem with your forearm muscles to maintain proper wrist alignment during grip-heavy activities. Have you ever tried holding onto a heavy weight or pulling yourself up on a bar without engaging those bicep muscles? It‚Äôs like trying to take down an elephant with a toothpick ‚Äì not gonna happen!

Here‚Äôs where things get interesting: strong biceps can enhance your overall grip strength. The more developed and powerful these babies are, the better able they are to support and assist other muscle groups involved in gripping.

And let‚Äôs not forget about aesthetics ‚Äì we all want toned arms that look good both at the beach and when we‚Äôre reaching for our favorite snacks on the top shelf. Stronger biceps mean more defined muscles, which is always a bonus when it comes to showing off our hard-earned gains.

**The Triceps and Grip**

Having strong triceps is like having an extra set of guns when it comes to grip strength. Imagine trying to hold onto a heavy barbell without these bad boys supporting your grip.

It would be like trying to catch flies with chopsticks! No, thank you.

Your¬†[triceps are responsible](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536996/#:~:text=With%20the%20arm%20adducted%2C%20the,arm%20at%20the%20shoulder%20joint.)¬†for extending your elbow joint ‚Äì which means they‚Äôre there to help stabilize and control your forearm as it works its magic gripping objects.

Strong triceps improve grip strength and enhance overall upper body strength. Want killer pecs? Strengthening those tris will give you better stability when bench pressing and allow for deeper chest engagement during push-ups.

**Abdominal Muscles and Grip**

Picture this: you‚Äôre trying to open a stubborn jar of pickles. Your grip strength fails you, and you resort to the old trick of banging it on the counter. But wait!

You remember that your abdominal muscles are now supercharged from all those short steel bending exercises you‚Äôve been doing. With newfound confidence, you grab that jar and twist it open effortlessly. Victory is sweet (and your pickles might be too)!

You might be wondering what your abs have to do with grip strength. Well, let us enlighten you!

Your abdominal muscles play a crucial role in stabilizing your body during movements that require a strong grip. They provide a solid foundation for power transfer between your upper and lower body.

When your abs are weak, they can‚Äôt effectively transmit force from your legs through your torso and into your arms and hands ‚Äì which means less gripping power for tasks like opening jars or crushing handshakes (not recommended). But when those ab muscles are toned and ready for action, they work in harmony with other muscle groups to maximize grip strength.

**5. Forget Mind Over Matter, It‚Äôs Mind With Muscle**

You‚Äôre at the gym,¬†[gripping those steel bars](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/spy.com/articles/health-wellness/fitness/short-steel-bending-1202944869/)¬†with all your might. Your muscles are working hard, but did you know that it‚Äôs not just your biceps and forearms doing all the heavy lifting? Nope!

It turns out that there‚Äôs a little something called the mind-muscle impact that plays a crucial role in grip strength exercises.

You see, when you focus your mind on squeezing those bars or bending that steel, something magical happens. Your brain sends signals to your muscles, telling them to tighten up and give it their all. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre having a conversation ‚Äì ‚ÄúHey, muscles, we‚Äôve got some serious work to do here! Let‚Äôs show ‚Äôem what we‚Äôre made of!‚Äù

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The mind-muscle impact also helps improve coordination and control over your movements. So, instead of flailing around like a fish out of water, you‚Äôll have precise control over every twist and turn.

And let‚Äôs not forget about mental toughness. When you push yourself through those challenging grip strength exercises, it takes mental fortitude to keep going when things get tough (and trust me, they will). But thanks to the mind-muscle impact, you‚Äôll be able to tap into that inner reserve of determination and push through any obstacles in your way.

Plus, there‚Äôs just something satisfying about knowing that your mind is as strong as your muscles. It gives you an extra boost of confidence ‚Äì like strutting into a room, knowing full well that you could crush anyone‚Äôs hand in a handshake if need be (though we don‚Äôt recommend actually doing so).

**How the Mind Muscle Impact Effects Grip Strength**

First off, let‚Äôs talk about concentration. When you really focus on squeezing those fingers together and holding on tight, something magical happens in your brain.

Your¬†[mind-muscle connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614191736/https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/)¬†gets stronger than ever before! It‚Äôs like a superhero team-up between your neurons and muscles ‚Äì they work together to create an iron-clad grip.

Your mental state can also impact how well you can hold onto that bar (or anything else for that matter). Ever notice how much easier it is to lift weights when you‚Äôre feeling confident and empowered?

That‚Äôs because the mind-muscle impact can actually enhance muscle performance.

Another way the mind-muscle impact affects grip strength is through visualization. By mentally rehearsing the movement before actually doing it, you activate the same neural pathways as if you were physically performing the exercise. This helps improve coordination and strengthens the connection between your brain and hand muscles.

Now, here‚Äôs where things get really interesting: stress management. We all know stress isn‚Äôt good for us (cue dramatic music), but did you know it can also weaken our grips? Yep, when we‚Äôre under stress or anxious, our bodies tense up, and our hands become more prone to slipping or losing their strength.

So what does all this mean for improving grip strength? Well, besides working on those forearm exercises like short steel bending (which are fantastic, by the way), don‚Äôt underestimate the power of your mind.",1,1740429284.0,shortsteelbending,0,1.0,False

1ixc74y,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1ixc74y/our_thoughts_from_our_1st_virgin_voyages_cruise/,Our thoughts from our 1st Virgin Voyages cruise.,"
My bride Michelle and I took our first Virgin Voyages Cruise a few weeks ago. We had always thought that it would be too wild for us. A friend of ours (Carrie and Jason) had been on a couple and said they thought we would like it and that it is not what people think it is. So we decided to give it a try. Carrie is also a travel agent and found and booked a great deal for us. We had a room called the Sea Terrace. It has a king-sized bed with a balcony. The balcony has room for two nice chairs and a hammock. I didn't think I would enjoy the hammock, but I knew Michelle would. She talked me into trying it out on our second day. I was in it for about 3 minutes before I fell asleep and slept for 2 hours. Michelle took a novel with her that was recommended by a co-worker about Nurses working M.A.S.H. units during the Vietnam conflict. She thought that she might get half of it read. She finished the book on the last day.
What we liked.
1. The first thing I noticed was that the boarding process seemed painful and long on cruises we have been on in the past. From the time we started boarding until we were in our room, it was about 10 minutes. I don't know how they have streamlined it so much, but they have boarding down to a science. While most, if not all, other lines make you wait to go to your room with Virgin, once you board, you can go to your room, which is nice because you can drop the bags you carried on and explore the ship.
2. We were not there for a party, and with my immune (Liver transplant recipient on anti-rejection meds) compromised system, we wanted to limit our exposure to as few people as possible, considering the time of year and the amount of illness out right now. Our terrace was a perfect place to hang out, and for the most part, it stayed in the shade most of the day. When it had direct sunlight and was super hot, we would find another spot to hang out. Even on sea days when everyone was on the ship all day, the ship did not seem overcrowded, and we could always find a quiet place to hang out. They have plenty of chairs everywhere and some very comfortable beds and cabanas to sit or lay on. We never struggled to find a place that was quiet and comfortable. Now, if you want to party, there is plenty of that for you, but it is also very easy to avoid! I also thought we would be the oldest people on the ship, but I can assure you we were not even close to being the oldest people on the ship.
3. Paying for extras is, for the most part, not something that you have to worry about because, unlike other lines, almost everything is included, including tips. The only things we noticed that were extra were alcohol, the spa, and some menu items that cost extra. They have specialty dining, but it is not extra like on other lines. I don't drink, and Michelle occasionally drinks beer or wine. I did look at the prices on the menu, and they did not seem out of line with what we would see at home at a local restaurant. Michelle had wine at dinner one night, $9.00 USD, and an espresso martini one night, $12.00 USD. The only other item we saw they had that would cost extra was specialty coffee. Now and again, Michelle will get it sometimes, but she didn't on this trip. I don't drink coffee. Michelle said that the other (Free) coffee was good. I also like that coke products are included at no extra charge.
4. No one is in your face trying to sell you anything like on other lines. There aren't photographers in your business trying to take a picture to sell you later. Or anything else, for that matter.
5. No constant overhead announcements. They do not have a cruise director, and the only overhead announcements we heard were the safety-related announcements after we boarded and 1 day in port. The crew did emergency evacuation training. And then it still wasn't crazy and only lasted a few moments. This was nice because the constant selling/announcements on the overhead of other lines made me nuts.
6. The food is, for the most part, spectacular and plentiful. I believe I am right, but there are 20+ different places to eat on the ship. As I said, there is no extra cost to visit, and specialty dining is free unless you want lobster or a Tomahawk steak. They also do not have a buffet-style eatery like other lines. They have a location called the galley that is like a food court at a mall, with restaurants around. You find a seat, and they have a code you scan to bring up the menu with your phone. When you are ready to order, you put a small flag up on the table, and very soon, someone will come and take your order from one place or all of them and bring your food to you. Personally, I loved this because it cuts down on contact/touch points like at a buffet. And if you like dessert/pastries, there are hundreds to choose from over the time we were on the ship. They also make them smaller so you can sample more than one. Michelle and I would get several and share. They also have an ice cream place that has specialty ice cream and three kinds of waffle cones. My favorite was Keylime pie, which I had every day! I also had a pain au chocolat (My favorite French pastry) every day.
7. The initial cost of the cruise includes a basic Wi-Fi package. It was plenty for us, and we even made video calls to our grandkids without any delays. It would not have worked for streaming, but for text, sending pictures, general surfing, and video calls, it was perfect! They do have higher packages for more money, but the basic was fine for us.
8. The service is top-notch! Everyone was very nice and great at what they did, and by the 3rd day, they were calling us by our names and asking if there was anything they could do for us!
9. They give you a scannable wristband that you use to buy anything and your room key. It's so simple because you always have it!
10. The bed was very comfortable, but they have a limited amount of mattress pads that make them even better. We asked very early (30 minutes after getting on the ship), and we got one of two left.
What we didn't like (this is very short)
1. The app that you use before boarding and once you get on the ship is slow and glitchy, which can cause some problems. They know about this and are working on a new app that i was told should be available soon.
2. Because of issues with the app, we tried to make reservations at what are considered the best two restaurants and could not get a reservation. We did get into one after three walk-up attempts, but we could not get into the other at all. They put our name on a waiting list and said they would let us know, but we had no further communication from them at all, which is highly annoying!
3. I love a good cheeseburger, but from what I could tell, there wasn't one on the ship! I tried it 2 times, and both were terribly basic and very dry. It is so weird because the food is, for the most part, so good, but something as basic as a cheeseburger was not good at all. Also, the french fries were very good but lacked any seasoning at all. I tried to put salt and pepper on them, but the salt and pepper shakers were tiny, and nothing was coming out because the holes were so small.
4. Some of the seating seemed to pick form over function and were very uncomfortable. It seemed as if they did all of the chair shopping at IKEA.
We are generally not cruise people and have done 4 or 5 in our nearly 38 years of marriage. We have never gotten off of a ship, and thought I could go do that again right now. Except this time. We were very disappointed that we had to leave, and we put a deposit on a future cruise before leaving. We could not decide if we wanted to do one in Alaska next or Europe.

He was nervous at first, but conversation flowed well after he relaxed and he was overall a gentleman. Since it was a Sunday and we wanted to keep hanging out, against my better judgement I invited him over. I would usually wait awhile before doing this, but I generally felt safe around this guy. I was a bit shy about the state of my home, but I was trying to be more open and vulnerable. For context, I moved into my current place about 4-5 months ago. I had to get rid of a lot of my old furniture that I had since getting my first apartment about 10 years ago. I thought it was time to start fresh now that I had more space to do more. My job is pretty commission based since I work in private practice and my pay depends on how many clients attend appointments. Since I moved in, holidays and insurance changes for clients have been making things at work pretty slow, so I can't furnish the way I would like to as easily until things pick back up. I have the basics, I just bought a new bed and nightstand, my dad got me a new couch for Christmas. I also was able to keep my old coffee table, dining table, tv, tv stand and bookshelves. So it isn't as cozy and homey yet. I haven't even fully invited my close friends over to hang out yet out of feeling embarrassed about the emptiness but they have seen it. When he came over, I apologized initially and mentioned I haven't been here long which he had seemed to had understood. We hung out and talked about our last 8 years single and barriers with jumping back into dating and it was a nice conversation with a few pink flags (i.e. very little dating experience outside of last relationship, and still living with parents) I was going to see how they would pan out. The next day, he asked to come back over and see me and wanted to bring me dinner which I thought was very sweet. He came over and at some point he mentioned how empty my apartment was not once, but twice which I thought was a bit weird. Even offering to buy me things to furnish it out of concern which I thought was thoughtful. I mentioned my best friend was coming to spend the weekend with me to attend a concert and then he said ""Oh I guess you have no money to get furniture because you spend so much on going to concerts?"" I retorted with ""If it bothers you so much you can buy me some furniture."" He said he only said these things out of concern and wanted me to be comfortable. I brushed it off, but a couple of days after, it was still bothering me. Usually I am too afraid to voice when things upset me in dating situations out of fear of abandonment, but wanted to continue what I practiced in these years of therapy. I asked can I express what was bothering me through text and he was intially open to it and encouraging. I told him I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and judged from his comment and explained the situation I already mentioned about financially and I've been sad about it enough already and the concert is what brings me joy outside of the heavy work I do. And it sounded like he wanted to be more comfortable being there rather than me. He responded with he can understand why I would take the comment in that way and it wasn't his intention anf he was sorry. Those kind of comments from him comes from a place of concern and not judgement. But then it felt like he began to throw things I shared back at me and said ""I understand why you can't give me the benefit of the doubt because of your past, but it's not great being seen as the villian when I think I'm jus being playful or trying to come from a good place."" I was nervous he was going to be done with me but he then reassured he wasn't done with me and overcoming these kind of things is important in lasting relationships. He even asked if things were too much. I told him I didn't see him as a villain at all, I appreciated the apology, but I voiced I was fine with how things were for now until things pick back up at work each time I said it, he continued the comments. I stated it was starting to feel like this is what he wanted for me and just be careful of how our concerns for others can be tiresome and we can overdo it at times. I feel like it wasn't too much I knew I would have some anxiety with dating again, but I'm trying to keep speaking up without fearing some things while asking him to be patient with me and I will do the same. But I reassured him that I was being open and vulnerable with him and I felt comfortable to. I was interacting with him differently than previous people I was getting to know. I'm not sure what happened or what I said wrong, but he completely switched. He said he was feeling more like the villian reading my response and it seems I'm not believing him or able to and he doesn't want to have to tiptoe arpind showing concern or want to apologize for repeatedly. He said it's clear we won't be compatible and that I'm pushing people away. Then he blocked me before I could say anything else wanting to continue this on the phone or in person. I've been really beating myself up about this since it happened and I feel like I just can't communicate well. I've always been afraid to speak up for myself because I always get ghosted when i do or someone ends up upset in this way. ",0,1740429091.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

1ixc1i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ixc1i3/does_the_best_undersink_water_filter_waterdrop/,Does the best under-sink water filter Waterdrop WD-15UA meet high expectations? A thorough review,"Using the Waterdrop WD-15UA under-sink water filter for several months has been an eye-opener in terms of improving water quality. As someone who has grown weary of chlorine-heavy tap water, I decided to give this filtration system a try, and the results have been impressive. However, there are a few nuances worth noting before you invest in one for your home.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**  
One of the standout features of this system is its extended filter lifespan. Designed to last up to 24 months or filter a staggering 16,000 gallons, the WD-15UA ensures that replacements won‚Äôt be a frequent hassle. I appreciate how this long lifespan translates to less maintenance and fewer expenses over time. However, I did notice that after about 18 months of heavy use, the water flow began to slow slightly, prompting me to consider replacing the filter earlier than advertised. Still, for most average households, this longevity is a standout benefit.

**Ease of Installation & Use**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up. With its push-to-connect fittings and a twist-and-lock design for the cartridge, the installation process took me under 20 minutes, and I didn‚Äôt even need to call a plumber. However, those with limited space under their sink might want to double-check the dimensions, as the filter unit stands at 16.7 inches tall. The system connects directly to your cold water line, making it a seamless addition to your kitchen without requiring a separate faucet.

**Certifications**  
Certifications play a vital role in assuring the quality of a water filtration system, and the WD-15UA doesn't disappoint. It meets NSF/ANSI 42 standards for removing chlorine, taste, and odor, while also adhering to NSF/ANSI 372 standards for lead-free materials. Knowing that this filter has been tested and certified offers peace of mind, particularly when clean, safe drinking water is a priority.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**  
The multistage filtration technology in this system is where it truly shines. It effectively reduces PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, lead, chlorine, and other harmful chemicals, along with sediments and large particles. After installing the filter, the difference in water taste was immediate. The chlorine taste was gone, and the water felt lighter and cleaner. I even noticed an improvement in the flavor of coffee and tea, which speaks to its ability to preserve the essential minerals while filtering out the unwanted impurities.

**Flow Rate & Performance**  
With a flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute at 60 psi, the WD-15UA delivers a steady and reliable water supply. I‚Äôve used it for drinking, cooking, and even filling my dog‚Äôs bowl, and the flow has been consistent. However, I did notice a slight dip in water pressure compared to the unfiltered tap, which might be a minor inconvenience for some users who prioritize a robust flow.

**Capacity & Suitability**  
The system is well-suited for a variety of applications, including daily drinking water, cooking, and even skincare routines. Its capacity easily meets the demands of a small to medium-sized household. However, for larger families or heavy water users, you might need to consider a system with a higher capacity to avoid frequent replacements.

**Warranty**  
Waterdrop offers a one-year warranty on the WD-15UA, which provides some confidence in the durability of the product. While I haven‚Äôt had any issues requiring warranty service, it‚Äôs good to know this safety net exists. Some competing brands, however, offer longer warranties, which might be a consideration if you‚Äôre looking for maximum coverage.

**Advantages**

* Compact design fits under most sinks efficiently.
* Excellent filtration of chlorine, lead, and other harmful substances.
* Long filter life reduces replacement frequency.

**Negatives**

* A slight drop in water pressure after installation.
* Larger size may not fit in extremely tight spaces.

**Peer Products**  
Compared to brands like Brita and Aquasana, the Waterdrop WD-15UA stands out for its multistage filtration and long filter life. While Brita systems are affordable and effective for basic filtration, they don‚Äôt match Waterdrop in terms of PFAS and lead reduction. Aquasana offers more sophisticated systems but at a significantly higher price point. For its balance of cost, filtration effectiveness, and ease of use, the WD-15UA carves out a strong position in the market.

**Value for Money**  
The WD-15UA delivers great value by balancing affordability with high-end features. While some might argue it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, its ability to last for two years, combined with its exceptional filtration capabilities, makes it a cost-effective choice. If you‚Äôre looking for clean water without breaking the bank, this product is worth considering.

She was doing well going into college when she was with her boyfriend. When she got a boyfriend, everything about her changed, she started excerising which is something she never does, she started getting up early to see him, she started cleaning the house and her room but that relationship only lasted three weeks and now her rooms a mess again and she won't move. 

I understand that it must be very hard without her boyfriend, shes autistic and doesn't have any friends and has always been a loner which she's hated. She's tried making friends with one girl but she rejected her and was very rude and tried to make another friend but got rejected. 

She was friends with one boy in college who pretended to have a crush on her but he was making fun of her, he used her and left her for other friends and left her all on her own. 

She got diagnosed with autism at 8 mostly for her social and communication skills. I can tell it has a huge impact which breaks my heart. 

I can't watch her all the time. I have a baby as well. 

Today my boyfriends friend noticed her in town instead of being in college, he said he saw her walking out of a Brazilian shop with coffee in her hand,  when she got back  she showed me her Brazilian food that she got, she told me that she didn't want to leave the shop as the people are so friendly. 

She's obsessed with South American culture generally. I always hear that music blasting out of her room. She loves it. 


She's doing gsces because she can't do A level, her previous school was a pupil referal unit and the teaching wasn't very good and she didnt get many gsces, , she failed maths and has had to retake  and I think that's knocked her confidence because she won't even try to revise saying it's pointless. 

She always compares herself to the pre 16s and her class is filled with them, she feels behind. 

College has started to get on my case as her attendance is below 80 percent. They already tried to schedule a meeting with me a few months ago but I was about to give birth and couldn't find the time.

## key Features ‚Äåto Consider When Choosing a ‚ÄåLaser Pico‚Å§ Projector

Before diving into the top 5 reviews, let's outline the crucial‚Å¢ factors you should consider when‚Å¢ selecting a laser pico ‚Å§projector:

*   ‚Å£**brightness (Lumens):** Brightness is measured ‚Äãin lumens, and it ‚Äãdetermines how well ‚Å¢the projected image will be visible in different‚Äç lighting conditions. For business presentations in‚Äå well-lit‚Äã rooms, aim for at ‚Äãleast 300 lumens or‚Äå higher.For home theater use in‚Å¢ darkened rooms, 100-200 lumens may be sufficient.‚Äç The brighter ‚Äåthe better usually,and always consider ‚Äçambient ‚Äãlight conditions.
*  ‚Å£ **Resolution (Native):** The ‚Äãnative resolution refers to the actual number of pixels displayed‚Å£ by the ‚Å£projector. ‚Å¢Higher resolution translates to a sharper and more detailed image. Aim for at least 720p (HD) or 1080p (Full HD) for ‚Äça satisfying viewing‚Äã experience. Some projectors support 4k input, but the ‚Äçnative resolution‚Å£ is more crucial.
*   **Contrast‚Å§ Ratio:** The‚Äç contrast ratio is the difference between‚Äã the ‚Å§darkest and brightest parts of ‚Å§an image. A higher contrast ratio results in ‚Å£a more dynamic and realistic picture. Look for a contrast ratio of at least 1000:1 or higher.
*   **Screen Size and Throw‚Å¢ distance:** The throw distance is‚Å£ the distance between the projector‚Äå and the screen. Different projectors have different throw ratios,which determine the screen size you can achieve ‚Å¢at a given distance.Ensure ‚Å¢that the projector you choose can project the desired screen size in‚Äç your available‚Å§ space. Many‚Äã offer throw distance calculators to‚Äã help with this.
*   **Connectivity:** Consider the connectivity options you need. HDMI input is essential for connecting‚Å§ to laptops, gaming consoles, ‚Äçand Blu-ray players.USB input‚Äç allows you to play‚Äã media‚Å§ files directly from a USB drive. Wireless ‚Äãconnectivity (WiFi connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity) enables‚Å§ screen mirroring from smartphones and tablets.
*   **Portability:** ‚ÄçIf portability is ‚Äça priority,‚Äå look for a lightweight and compact projector ‚Å¢with a built in ‚Å¢battery. Check the dimensions and weight‚Äå to‚Äã ensure it ‚Äãfits comfortably in your bag or pocket.
*   **Battery Life:** If you ‚Äåplan to use the projector on the go,‚Å§ pay attention to the‚Äç battery life. A longer battery life allows ‚Äãfor extended viewing sessions‚Å§ without needing to recharge.
*   ‚Å¢**Keystone Correction:** Keystone correction automatically corrects distorted images‚Å¢ caused by projecting at an angle. Automatic keystone is a convenient‚Å§ feature that ensures a perfectly rectangular image, even if the projector isn't perfectly aligned.
*  ‚Å§ **Smart Features:** ‚Å¢Some laser pico projectors come with built-in‚Äã android TV or other smart features, allowing you to stream movies, TV shows, and other content directly from the projector. They may have built-in streaming apps. Screen mirroring lets you easily project content from your smartphone or ‚Äçtablet.
* support for tripod mount: This is helpful if you ‚Äåwant‚Å¢ to set up ‚Å§the projector in a ‚Å£fixed way‚Äç and keep‚Äã a solid ‚Å£image.

## Beyond the Specs: Real-World Considerations

While specifications provide a useful framework for comparison, it's equally important to consider real-world factors that‚Äã can impact your ‚Å£experience ‚Äãwith a‚Äå laser pico projector:

*   **Ambient Lighting:** The brightness of your environment will significantly affect ‚Å¢the‚Äã perceived image quality. In bright rooms,‚Å£ you'll need a projector with higher brightness to compensate for the ambient light.
*   **Screen Surface:** The‚Äå type of screen surface you use can also impact image‚Å¢ quality. A dedicated projector screen will provide the best results, but you‚Å§ can also ‚Å¢use a white ‚Å£wall or even a bed sheet in a pinch.
* ‚Å§  **Audio Quality:** Many‚Å§ pico projectors have built-in speakers, but their audio quality may be ‚Å£limited. Consider ‚Å£using external ‚Äçspeakers or headphones for a more ‚Äåimmersive audio ‚Äåexperience.*   **Ease of Use:**‚Å§ Look for a projector with a user-friendly interface‚Äå and intuitive controls.A remote‚Äã control can also be handy for navigating ‚Å§menus and adjusting settings.
*   **Durability:** If you plan to take your ‚Å§projector on the go, choose a model ‚Äçthat is built to ‚Å§withstand the rigors of travel. Look for a projector with a robust casing and scratch-resistant lens.Don't ‚Äãforget to check ‚Å§if‚Å£ it comes with a carrying ‚Äåcase.
*‚Å¢   **Customer Support:**‚Å¢ In the‚Äã event that you‚Å§ encounter any ‚Äãissues with your projector, it's important to‚Å£ have access to reliable customer support. Check the manufacturer's‚Å£ website for warranty information, FAQs, and contact information.

1ixbul5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1ixbul5/i_held_on_for_as_long_as_i_could/,I held on for as long as I could,"This is a log of things I thought were unacceptable at my workplace. The owner liked me, but i believe the management felt threatened and thus belittled me at every chance.

I've tried to organize this, but it's still a mess.

We had technicians from the Netherlands here to build a CNC 3D pipe profiling machine and I was building it with them. Jay (Superintendent) said to our Netherlands guests, ""If you don't like someone, you just kick 'em here in America."" This is unacceptable.

""You can't teach an old dog new tricks. I'm an old dog."" ‚Äì Jay

While I'm in the middle of working on the air setup for the fume extractor, Jay tells me to accept a delivery at the other end of the building while he and Bob are laughing it up doing nothing. (9/25/24 @ 8:45 AM)

Jay has fabricated this idea of me based on
the other people who were hired around the time I was hired and the very very few times he comes out of his office to even have sight of me in the month I've been at the new shop.

He made assumptions of me based on fallacious prejudices, mistook my kindness for weakness and implied I am nothing like him by describing his life. He is the kind of person who likes to make a mountain out of a molehill for people he does not favor.

For example, I have made it a point since being hired to keep the fab shop clean, take the trashes out and lock the doors. In fact, Thursday I was bringing a trash can out to the dumpster and Jay says, ""Take the trashes out when you have downtime."" What did he think i was doing? 

I've already far exceeded his expectations of me for a while now, but he's not aware or present to take inventory, and even when he is, he is blind to my actions. I'm afraid if I keep meeting or exceeding his expectations, he will never see it because he has set himself up intentionally not to see it. Because of this, there is zero incentive to do well.

Fortunately, I am the kind of person who doesn't do things for praise, but because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. Not everyone is like that, though. But he makes it clear that his expectations of me are to show up early, take out the trash, clean, paint and work. I'm suposed to be a Jr Foreman. My title is Jr Welding Foreman. I am a journeyman-level welder.

Jay felt the need to give me his life story in order for me to understand that his way is the ONLY way. I have never met a more counterproductive, careless, and ignorant manager. Perhaps his ""management"" style works in a small town where employment is limited, but in a city like Phoenix, this business will be a revolving door.

I don't need to tell you that Jay is the old-fashioned, brute, ignorant, stubborn, negative boss‚Äînot a leader. This guy is a walking, laughing cluster of fallacies. Gen Xers and boomers are making an exodus out of the trades, and regardless of how anyone feels about it, millennials, zoomers, and gen-alpha are the ""new guard"" that will either come on in and work or avoid and publicly shun.

Managers need to thoroughly understand how to execute concepts like operant conditioning, positive reinforcement, skill sublimation, conflict resolution, mediation, etc. Understanding human reactance, critical thinking, negativity bias, and objectivity are also essential.

Wed, Oct. 9th, 2024, Jay did not bat an eyelash at the welder on the west wall running a generator-welder indoors, filling the building with noxious fumes. He said he'd take care of it, so I dropped it. It just blows my mind because the solution was as easy as opening a door and moving the welder outside, but it had to be a whole confrontation... the fact that I had to say anything at all kind of scares me; how could my fellow welder be so careless and my superior be so ignorant?

Derek informed me that Ashton and Bob were making fun of Daniel and me behind our backs. They were making fun of the Dutch tech, Darrell,  as well. Ashton could not have been more insufferable with Darrell while calibrating the HGG. Daniel and I are quiet because we listen, but they assume our attention is stupidity. We are not machines or children. We are adult humans who chose to learn.

Regardless of these red flags, I will continue to give them everything they expect of me because I greatly respect the owner and I enjoy this craft.

Bottom line, Jay hates me, and my best can never be enough for him. It's not possible.

I should have gone to HR immediately after these issues, but I did not want to rock the boat.

The differential treatment of employees by Jay, Dick, and Ashton is toxic and against company policy. Ashton constantly leaves spit cans and bottles everywhere without throwing them away. He does not clean anything.
Daniel actively avoids work. He doesn't finish a task he's been assigned when he doesn't like it. He talks back and questions why he's being told to do something.
Previous shop we moved from: Jay throws a fit when previous fab shop guys get coffee in the morning, but doesn't bat an eyelash when the field welders show up to the new shop at 6:30 am and leave at 2 pm. They spend more time standing around drinking coffee in the new shop under Jay. Asinine.
I was a fitter/welder in the previous shop and was sent to build the CNC pipe cutter with the machine techs because I was going to be the operator. While I was building it, my shop manager who arranged for me to operate the machine was fired (Idk why).This egocentric rich kid asshat, Ashton, was hired and took over EVERYTHING I was doing. He was hired to operate the machine. Jay told me Ashton is my superior and I must listen to him. I did not argue. Jay said 'we hired Ashton to run the machine because it requires really high tolerance; not the tolerance you're thinking,"" as he assumes I'm thinking of social tolerance, ffs. I should have cut him off there and said ""well actually, it requires very LOW tolerance precision. Not only have I built die cleaning machines from scratch that also require low tolerance (as did everything else I've made at all of my employers), I have gold medals from my time in competitive indoor percussion as a snare drummer which requires ultimate low tolerance precision and accuracy. I also tested out of calculus in high school so I wouldn't have to take it in college. I'm the only laborer here with a degree."" But, I didn't say any of that. I just listened.

The first week Ashton got here he was proselytizing for Donald Trump, pressuring ""political"" discussion at work.
Oct 14th, 2024, Ashton moved on from 2"" pipe too soon. The lead-out plasma cut was not long enough to let the cut part drop off the pipe. He changed pipes instead of figuring it out.
Wednesday, Oct 23rd, 2024 Ashton intentionally drove a forklift without a safety belt and without certification, then lied to Dick (safety) later that day that he used the safety belt when he used the forklift without certification. Dick did not follow up with disciplinary action.
Thurs Oct 24th, 2024 Ashton grabs Dick's hand and mockingly skips away together making fun of Daniel and I simply for going together to get respirators from the warehouse while there was downtime. Ashton had gone with Justin earlier that morning to Autozone to get a part, so why make fun of us? Ashton is regularly passive-aggressive whether he knows about it or not. My role has been reduced to taking out the garbage and filling the fridge with waters, which I've always done since day one. I've been hoping Daniel will catch on and start doing those things without me having to ask him, but he doesn't respect me at all.
10/25/24: Ashton says ""Darin, I think you'd make a better plumber than a welder."" ""Why's that,"" I ask."" ""Your crack is perfect.""
Friday, Oct 25th, 2024 Almost got caught in between the hydraulic levers on the CNC pipe cutter because nobody was paying attention to me putting the panels back on the backside. Nobody gave a warning.
10/29/24 I was operating the blue telehandler when a pipe rolled off the forks due to stick drift and sandwiched Daniel's left leg between another pipe. Daniel actually put his leg between the pipes for some reason. The telehandler elevation control wasn't working properly. I had to give a UA, but Daniel did not. What kind of policy is this?
10/30/24 I told Daniel and Ashton to sweep up around the 3D pipe cutter when they're just standing around and neither one of them swept all day. Justin, the tech, proceeded to throw the broom and dust bin across the room. I'm literally just trying to keep the area clean and safe, but there is a negative attitude about me being spread around. I wanted to see if anybody else would take the initiative and clean because I'm always the only one in this group regularly keeping the area clean.
10/31/24 After Jay explained OSHA doesn't allow high PSI air over 35 psi to be run to the far side of the shop, Justin said ""What, are they faggots, hippies over there?""
11/1/24 Ashton asked me if I voted. Daniel just left at the end of the day without touching base with me. I was cleaning the 3D pipe cutter and needed him to help me finish up. After Ashton and Daniel operated the 3D pipe cutter all day, I was the one who cleaned the entire thing without any help. There is no initiative to keep this machine clean and maintained.
11/5/2024 Ashton takes my extension cord charging my drill battery to use for his grinder instead of getting his own cord. Then he walks away and doesn't plug my battery back in. He has a general lack of awareness for others.
11/6/2024 Dick is talking about big black male genitalia. Dick is talking politics. Jay is showing us photos of a horse's penis. Dick often implies sexual innuendo.
12/6/2024 I asked Daniel to use the telehandler to move I-beam and angle iron on the saw, but he ignored me and made me carry the pieces with him. I specifically asked him because I'm still having body aches from Covid. I was cutting angle for the pipe roller when I had to go do another task, so I told Daniel to finish cutting the angles. I told Doug to finish welding those angles on the roller table, but he used them on the thing Ashton was building instead of doing what I told him to do.
12/12/2024 Jay started the day with a meeting saying he doesn't give a shit about safety and that he does not have a foreman even though I am a junior foreman.
1/2/25 I found that whoever was cutting 1¬º"" pipe for Vela had gotten about halfway through, but it was the wrong size (1"") and it was just left there in the open with the threader and scraps everywhere from the day before. I brought in 1¬º"" pipe and re-cut all of it.
1/6/25 Ashton came over to us and said we have a lot of nice plumbers on our team today, referring to our butt cracks. This is maybe the 4th time Ashton has said this to me.
1/17/25 I was using the blue telehandler because everyone was using both telehandlers regardless if they had certification or not. I was operating it just fine and Dick raised his voice at me, forcing me off of it. He then proceeded to tell people I hit a wall with a pipe (which I did not) in order to justify nobody driving the telehandlers except for Hunter. When I said I'm the only one being scrutinized, Dick said there wasn't a target on my back, but he just said the quiet part out loud. It's obvious there's a target on my back. And now Bob is saying specific people can drive it even though they aren't certified. Hunter drives the blue telehandler without using the seat belt or spotter. He recertified Daniel after the incident, but not me. Dick is creating a narrative about me that I'm bad on the telehandler and unsafe when the truth is that I'm just as safe if not safer than anyone in this shop. This morning Hunter, Ben, Henry, another guy and I were loading the trailer with pipe, but nobody was wearing hard hats until I brought them out for everyone to wear.

1/24/2025 At 7:15am Bob told me sternly I am not allowed in the office or the breakroom and that snacks are not for laborers (me, specifically). I asked why and he got snippy as usual. I was the one who made sure that refrigerator was full of water and the trash was empty. Now, I can't even go in the break room or the office at all.

1/28/2025 Bob and Ashton are inside the shop at 5:50, but the side entrance where everyone regularly enters is locked. Everybody was waiting for that door to be unlocked.

1/31/25 Everyone is driving the telehandlers again, except for me. I'm cutting angle iron while the temp-to-hire welders are fitting and welding pipe. Adrian and Dalton stood at an open garage door doing nothing for an hour this morning and Brandon relays to me he hears I'm on my phone all the time, but I'm not on it any more than anyone else. The longest time I'm on it is to fill out Procore or write a work email.

1/7/25 Before going home sick, Bob told me to cut the corners off all the table angles in the shop. I found a cordless grinder with no handle and I could not find a handle.

The Fab Shop Manager position should have been mine after Dean left, but when Ashton took over everything I was doing, I knew I was being actively marginalized. However, when Dalton asked to be a foreman they made him one (not a Jr) and they immediately began treating him like one even though HE is the one who dropped a 24"" pipe from 20' in the air off the telehandler and almost crushed Dick's work truck at the previous shop. Perhaps Dick had thought that was me who did that. Dalton/Darin...idk.  Bob, Ashton, and Jay equate me with Daniel, the 18yo with zero experience and education. And when they do need something done, they ask Daniel, not me. Nobody communicates with me for any reason other than something negative.

2/5/25 Bob says to me ""[Ashton is a] smartass. I ought to punch that guy.""

2/14/25 Ashton tells Jerry he's taken two bottles of Nyquil because he's sick at work putting everyone else at risk of getting sick when I was forced to take sick time when I got sick. And operating heavy machinery with two bottles of Nyquil in you is unacceptable.

2/18/25 Hunter dropped two pipes off truck/pallet with large grey forklift. Nobody said or did anything while Jerry, Bob, Kyle, and Jay were standing there talking. Neither Ben nor Hunter reported the incident. But, I got written up for simply using the grey forklift (stabbing pipe not allowed apparently, I was not aware). No incident. I went to ask Dick if anyone reported Hunter's incident this morning and nobody had, so I reported it because I'm absolutely fed up with the hyper focus on me for no reason. End of day Ashton is telling Jerry something about sucking dick all day. I don't know, it's just inappropriate.

2/19/25 Hunter not wearing seat belt and no spotter in orange Telehandler, regularly. Bob gave me a cut sheet for 2"" and 3"" pipe, and told me to ""start on 2."" I finished cutting both 2"" and 3"", he got upset and said he told me to only cut the 2"" pipe and walked away throwing his hands up as if I'm a bumbling fool.

Tuesday, Feb 18th at 5:27pm I wrote a thank you text message to Bob because I screwed up that day using the grey forklift incorrectly (unbeknownst to me at the time) in front of the GM and wanted to show I am not careless. Wednesday, Bob gave me a cut list and I heard him say ""start on the 2"", but he apparently said cut only the 2"" and I ended up double cutting about 10 pieces of 3"" pipe Ashton had also cut using the 3D pipe cutter. This is nothing to get bent out of shape about. We can use the pipe on another section. Thursday morning Bob said he had a talk with Jerry and they decided no more single ear bud nor the bone-conducting headphones Brandon (owner) bought for us because obviously that in and of itself was the problem üôÑ. It wouldn't have made a difference if I had been wearing ear plugs instead of one headphone when he gave me instructions from 15' away. And Bob is incredulous to the fact that 1. I am hard of hearing and 2. Bob has zero communication skills. Bob stated how annoying it is to have to repeat himself when his son says ""what?"" over and over again, as I often do. It's like he's unable to put two and two together. I say ""what?"" over and over and he knows I make an effort each time to hear him better. Because he sees me through the lens of being on some kind of same level as his son, he thinks I'm not paying attention. Or, he needs to get his son's hearing checked. I genuinely must have misheard him that day because I explicitly heard him say ""start on the 2."" He also did not say anything to me when he watched me bringing 3"" to my saw. He swears to me he said to only cut the 2"", so why didn't he say anything to me not to cut the 3"" pipe? I know he's a deceptive liar by pretending not to have received my thank you text from Tuesday evening. Did he lie to me in this instance also? Did I actually hear him correctly when I heard him say ""start on the 2,"" but he's throwing me under the bus to save his own ass in this minor mistake? Bob has never communicated clearly, sometimes intentionally.

I rolled my eyes and scoffed when he said no more ear bud and that's when Bob said I was throwing a fit and stamping my feet like his son. No, I did no such thing. The previous day when he had seen that I had redundantly cut the 3"" pipe Ashton also cut, he immediately turned around, took off his hat and cut off communication walking away. Bob said he walked away because he has anger issues and he essentially said he was avoiding doing something violent. So, when I tell him he needs to learn how to lead, this is precisely what I'm referring to. Sure, walking away is better than ""one of us ending up on the ground,"" in his words. But, that is an extremely low bar of emotional intelligence, especially in a workplace setting. I expect my superior to be able to calmly, honestly and professionally evaluate the situation and proceed without needless communication breakdown and morale death.

Bob's comm break was a much bigger issue than my irritated response to him telling me no more ear bud. And when I tried to point that out to him he said he was treating me badly like I treat him... even though his behavior preceded mine and is completely in line with his lack of pragmatics, communication, leadership, mental health, emotional intelligence and maturity. I told him he is not a leader and does not communicate properly with anyone. He said ""And I'm going to learn that from you?"" ""Yes!"" I said, mentioning my degree in Psychology, to which he laughed at. I said ""and now you're laughing at me because you don't respect education or me."" At first he said ""I'm not laughing"" while laughing. I said ""look at you!"" He repeated ""look at me!"" mocking me. Then he said ""ok fine, I am laughing, so what?"" I said ""you don't respect me.""

Bob instructed me to groove pipe instead of TIG weld stainless pipe as I had arranged with Jerry the day before. I went to the groover which Daniel was working on and asked him what needed to be done and what I could do. He waffled around avoiding me and said he needed to get with Hunter on something. So I waited around for a bit while Daniel ignored me and Hunter gave me dirty looks, then I started packing up my things in my truck one by one so as not to raise attention and Bob came over to me and asked why I wasn't grooving pipe. I told him they didn't need me. Bob said he didn't care if they needed me or not he told me to groove pipe. Bob said Daniel and Hunter said they did not want me around, but that he didn't care and wanted me to groove the pipe. I will not work alongside children like this.
Bob proceeded to say that he always asks me to do something and then he finds me not doing it. Not only is this not the case, it is evidence of his lack of communication. He was getting upset at me as if I intentionally just go do my own thing instead of following his instruction. This is where my view of Bob as a liar is solidified; I said I know you don't bring your phones in your house when you go home, but I asked Bob if he had received my ""thank you"" text Tuesday night. He kinda shook his head and said ""No, I don't know."" So I proceeded to tell him what I said in the text; that he and Jay are my ""Northstar"" and that I think Bob is a brilliant fitter/fabricator/welder and that I listen to everything he says and does (regardless of how shitty of a person he can be, but I didnt say that). So, his notion that I'm careless and self-centered when he gives me instruction is completely off-base. Bob then confesses ""I got your text,"" to which I replied ""You did get it?! Well then why didn't you just say yes, you got it?"" To which he replied ""I don't know. I didn't think it was a big deal."" The big deal is that he does not value honesty (at least with me) no matter the magnitude. Had Bob cared and comprehended my thank you text, and grown a little from it, he wouldn't have acted like a child by pretending not to receive my thank you text and using his perceived ignorance of it as leverage, a manipulation tactic. ""Perception is reality"" as Bob says. He is invested in manipulating everyone's perception of him. This is why he is still in his role today. This shows me that Bob would rather create and maintain hardships, miscommunication and failure for me in favor of himself rather than intellectually honestly fixing it and move on.  I have been the voice of reason and the agent of deescalation while Bob rides his fallacies and emotions round and round on the same merry-go-round of toxic behaviors and interactions, over and over again. And either being called out for it or existing around others who don't do it makes him uncomfortable. He sees it as ""his older way of life,"" but it's simply a life of dishonesty, egocentrism, cruelty, conformity, exclusion, bitterness, anger, prejudice and discrimination (about who others are and what they can do), and fallacies as fact, all again as he sees it necessary and forgiven.

Bob withheld the fact that he received my thank you text and proceeded to berate me as if my shortcomings were intentional. Bob has said a few times that he's not with this new generation of doing things, which I can only assume as being aware, critical, discrete, inclusive, diverse, etc. What I think he means is he is not used to being humble, communicative, honest, collected, called out, critical or discrete. The magnitude to which Bob projects the disapproval of his own son onto me is insane, while at the same time Bob is being childish himself by being angry, wanting a dirty diaper party, and not acknowledging my thank you text because that would ""give me a 'win'."" Not acknowledging my thank you text enabled Bob to continue treating me like a child, closing down communication and ignoring my efforts. By not admitting to receiving my message it gives him leverage by claiming I never opened up a channel of communication; I never made an effort to make a concerted change.

One of the last things Bob said to me was that Dean had made me out to be super incredible, but my welds had quality issues. Those issues were not brought up to me other than the issues I had had with Bob throwing off my concentration. If I truly had quality issues, this is not an accurate representation of my regular welding capabilities. Why would my first welding employer rehire me 6 years later to build more die cleaning machines if I'm such a bad welder?

There is a crony clique headed by Jay followed by Bob and Ashton, and they are a toxic power-hungry trio. It's simply a ""boy's club"" and I'm not in it, neither are many others, but those who are in it are the ones in core positions.

I have no doubt Jay's prejudiced opinions of me formulated through my appearance either/and/or whatever Bob has told him about me spurred on the weaponization of the safety department against me in an effort to get me to quit or strike me out to fire me. There is a tolerance of safe performance of a telehandler or a forklift. Everyone, certified or not, operates within that tolerance including me, but we all occasionally have a mishap or an issue. Dick was always there to slap my wrist, but NEVER for anyone else. The one time I have a safety issue I get written up, but the repeated intentional disregard for safety requirements like the use of a spotter and a seat belt by anyone else is NEVER addressed, ever. Hunter dropped pipes off the grey forklift off the side of Ben's truck while Bob (foreman), Jerry (shop manager), Jay (Superintendent) , and Kyle (GM) were standing there talking. Nobody batted an eyelash and Hunter kept on working with the forklift. Even after I asked Ben to report the safety violation/incident to Dick, he hadn't. The next morning when I was made to sign a writeup for just driving a forklift, I asked Dick if an incident report was made the day before for the pipes Hunter dropped with the grey forklift. He said ""no,"" so I said ""This is me reporting a safety incident."" I am an extremely safe and skilled telehandler and forklift driver. It is obvious I was being held to a much higher level of scrutiny than everyone else and was literally being the only one paid attention to on the forklifts because of their fabricated notion I am unskilled and unsafe. No evidence exists that I am either. Yes, I was involved in a safety incident involving the blue telehandler and Daniel where Daniel intentionally put his leg between large pipes that were rolling together after the stick in the telehandler drifted, causing the forks to drop slowly so when I raised the fork elevation off the flat ground they were no longer slightly leaned back to keep the pipe from rolling forward. It had drifted downward while the forks were on the ground so when I lifted the forks up they were no longer in the tilted position they had initially been in. This is the first time I learned of the stick drift in the blue telehandler. Instead of getting it fixed, Dick just refused to recertify me.

I cancelled Spotify, because I don't listen do music anymore. Yes, there are people that don't care much about music, I used to listen just for a few days a week, I don't like podcasts either, so I decided to cancel the subscription too.

I don't miss both, I'm saving time and money, so for me I think it was a good decision.

With rhyming couplets, crafted flawlessly.   
Not me! I sing something less severe:   
A poem for fun, and easy on your ear.  

No sloppy text, nor archaic phrases,   
Just language used on a daily basis.   
The coffee break, or the itchy nose,   
The sock that‚Äôs lost, where it always goes.  
  
The message sent, yet, no reply,   
You check again ‚Äî not sure why.   
But your phone‚Äôs at 1% ‚Äî about to die,   
So you rush for the charger there nearby.   
  
Then a day goes by, then two, then three‚Äî   
Then you text: ‚ÄúWhy are you ignoring me?‚Äù   
  
And the bag of something that won‚Äôt ever tear,   
(This happens to you at least two times a year!)   
  
So here it is, with its simple rhyme,   
A verse that simply kills some time.   
But if poets frown; and critics jeer,   
I have written poems more severe.

**I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.**

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

Hi, i am a tunisian student who goes to (such and such) school in (such and such) state,not so long ago i was randomly stopped in broad daylight and questioned to the last detail of my life while on my way to school after having a cup of coffee for having a beard..,now mind you i am just a student which of course equals to me being young and of course that means i dont have a really developed beard so its barely even noticeable and ironic how they even called it a ""beard"".

Maybe they were trying to compliment me xD

Anyhow,i was having the worst stomachache ever after drinking that coffee cup and this car (no indication that they were cops) stops in front of me and one of them asks for my id aggressively, their doors were slightly cracked open just in case i decide to run, at first i thought it was a joke but then i realised the opposite long story short,they went through my phone(pictures,songs,social media,contacts, literally every app),my belongings,asked me every question in the book and ""is this a sunnah beard, do you pray?"" And questions similar to that,i was genuinely terrified.

I've never commited any crimes and i dont intend to do so,and while this may seem like a random stop a teacher got put in a cop car and took to the station from Infront of school for a post on Facebook and recently some guy that goes the same school got detained and picked up, transported to the station and investigated for having a nasheed which i do blame it on him for downloading such material in a country that tragically suffered from t*rrorism.

Imp,stopping random students who aren't suspicious JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SEMI TRANSLUCENT BEARD is unhinged coming from our government,they seriously need to step up their anti-t*rrorism department and tactics and stop being jumpy nobody uses Facebook,and even if they did they're missing out on the other platforms such as X and ig.

I was able to tour some great homes in terms of design, layout, furnishings, and of course, the Mid-century vibe. I toured 14 homes. I met some wonderful, gracious owners and very helpful docents. Overall, I enjoyed it but then, I like architecture and well-done Mid-century interior design.

Of the 14 homes, 9 were owned by a gay man, a gay couple, or a gay throuple, or combination of a gay couple and their good friend who is an interior designer. üôÇ I have to tell you, I was claustrophobic in just about all the homes owned by gay men! *EVERY* surface was covered with stuff! Paintings (including many abstracts with very loud colors) on every inch of wall space and then, paintings propped up because there was no place to hang them. Knickknacks, tchotchkes, elegant glass, bowls, vases, books, throws, ornate mirrors, exquisitely designed coffee and end tables, etc., etc. In one home, I was so overwhelmed by the colors and the clutter (and the low ceilings) that I had to get out there!üôÉ My favorite room in any house is the bathroom. A few bathrooms I saw were so over-the-top, I couldn't imagine using them on a daily basis - the tiles were loud and garish.

The remaining 4 homes were owned by a single woman, and 3 hetero couples. Simple (and expensive) interiors and cleaner lines but way less stuff packed into those spaces.

Even my few gay friends here in San Francisco have these homes packed with stuff! I don't get it. Is that a gay thing? A lot of ""stuff?""",0,1740427840.0,palmsprings,13,0.35,False
