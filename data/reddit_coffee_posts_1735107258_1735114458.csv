I remember last Xmas day, where I has to sit at the Xmas table with my partners family plus extended in a foreign country while they all spoke another language. I was so hungover that I felt like my head had been blown to bits, I felt like I was inside a glass bubble, I'd be speaking to people and feel myself floating away. It was so disturbing. Then I thought I'd solve the issue by eating copious amounts of food and drink copious amounts to only feel worse. I remember the look on my sister in laws face as I spoke nonsense, the shame inside. Another family member commenting on how much I love prosecco, another shame bullet. I was miserable that Xmas holiday. I remember telling myself I needed to stop drinking, I continued for almost another year. 

Today, I've woken up at 8am, after a crap night's sleep, I've burnt the coffee maker. But, my head is clear and I feel full of self respect. 

I just wanted to write this to help me remember, to defeat those thoughts of false nostalgia. ",2,1735113892.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I was considering bringing my AeroPress, a few bags of different beans and my hand grinder (K6) alongside an electric tea kettle for expediency.

I‚Äôve not used my AeroPress for much outside of iced coffees using the Hoffman recipe so not sure what to expect there compared to the Switch. I‚Äôll potentially be brewing cups for others as well.

Obviously one of these two options is more work when traveling but it‚Äôs not a far drive.

1hlwk81,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hlwk81/stomach_acid_burns_in_throat_and_mouth/,Stomach acid burns in throat and mouth,"25F, diagnosed GERD but never given a stage, currently taking Adderall 15mg, Lamotragine 10mg. 

Around thirty minutes ago as I‚Äôm writing this, I had a splash of acid reflux come up into the back of my throat and mouth. I have had GERD since I was a child so this is not a new occurrence, but this instance was very different than any I have experienced before. It usually is an unpleasant taste of vomit (obviously because it is) and it just goes back down, I drink water and everything is normal. No pain or anything weird. I drank alcohol and coffee a couple hours earlier which I know exacerbate GERD, but I didn‚Äôt eat any major triggers. 

However, this time it came up into my throat and was incredibly painful. It almost felt thinner as in less viscous, and it did not go back down effortlessly as it usually does. It clung to my throat and back of the roof of my mouth and some got in my windpipe and sent me into a major coughing fit. 

I immediately drank water to hopefully rinse it off and send everything back down, but the pain didn‚Äôt change at all. It still felt like it was sitting in place and burning the same, if not worse. I also took 20mg Famotidine to reduce the chances of another flare up. I can feel the area in my mouth that the acid touched is very tender and is raised and irritated, and my throat is still in a lot of pain. I have continued to drink water and have drank about 16oz since the initial flare. 

My main concern is what my next steps are. The pain has stayed the same and my throat is making a bunch of clear thin mucus in response to the irritation. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs any physical injury that would cause issue going forward, and I‚Äôm not sure what else I should do to help with the acid reflux or the pain. It‚Äôs late and I plan to sleep propped up, but beyond that I‚Äôm a bit lost. Also random, but my father is a dentist and I will be seeing him tomorrow for the holiday. If there would be any benefit to him taking a look back there, let me know lol.

They are scamsters.

Their Modus operandi is

1. They will call for 40 mins of 1-1. 2.Create a trap for you with Free stay , free flight tickets
2. Their team will offer tea , coffee, snacks and much more.
3. Will tell they have tie up with ITC, Marriot , sheraton and many more big names.
4. They will tell if you pay ""x"" you will get to stay in these hotels for 34 to 50 nights depending on the package without spending a penny further. And per night economics will look like Rs.2500 to Rs.3000 in these star hotels 6.Then they will create a time pressure by saying all these are valid only if you join / enroll today itself.

\*The biggest trap is , they will show video testimonials and very customer friendly approach.

What they will not tell you is

1. About black out days - i.e from Dec 20 to Jan 10 they will not give you booking ( it also differs from package to package)
2. If you enroll in their membership and wish to cancell then the penalty is 30% of your payment and the balance amount you will receive only in 90 days ( lucky if you receive it)
3. Flight tickets has to be booked 60 days in advance.
4. If you make a hotel booking and happen to cancel it , then your day count is lost.
5. No body will pick your call after the membership sales has happened.
6. They falsely commit many things like "" no booking restrictions "" , "" If booking is cancelled , the day would be saved"" , "" No blackout date"", No restrictions on room category like "" Villa , suite, etc..)"" & much more ( the list of their false commitment is exhaustive).

The main problem is  
Unlike club mahindra or any other holiday membership, Club resorto is a scamster.  
They dont have any team to address your travel bookings or changes or queries.  
They will keep changing their policies to keep you trapped or to the least you will not be able to make the right booking at the right time for your travel.

Since they handle their marketing (alias scamming ) in very professional manner like organising in the top or the best hotel in the city , it will initially look ultra genuine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people dream of a bright, white smile, and visiting a teeth whitening dentist can turn that dream into a reality. Before and after experiences often showcase drastic transformations that boost confidence and enhance appearances. In this article, we‚Äôll explore what you can expect before and after such treatments and how these services can dramatically change your smile.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Treatments

Teeth whitening comes in various forms, from in-office procedures to take-home kits. By understanding the methods available, you can choose what works best for you:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This is done under professional supervision, using powerful whitening gels and special lights. Results are often immediate and impressive.
- **At-Home Kits:** Dentists may provide custom trays and whitening gels for you to use at home. This method takes longer but allows for convenience and comfort.
- **Whitening Strips:** These over-the-counter options are more affordable but may offer less noticeable results than professional whitening.

### What to Expect Before Treatment

Before you start treatment, visiting a teeth whitening dentist typically involves certain steps:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Dental Examination:** Your dentist will assess your overall oral health to ensure that your teeth and gums are in good condition.
2. **Consultation:** Discuss your whitening goals, concerns, and preferences with your dentist. They can recommend the best whitening method tailored to your needs.
3. **Pre-Treatment Cleaning:** A professional cleaning may be scheduled to remove any plaque or tartar, allowing the whitening solution to work more effectively.

Understanding these steps helps ease any anxieties and prepares you for the journey ahead. Knowing you are in experienced hands fosters a sense of trust and anticipation for positive change.

### The Transformation Process

During the treatment, the process usually includes the application of a whitening gel specifically designed for your mouth. If you choose in-office whitening, your dentist will activate the gel using a special light. This can take about an hour, and you will see immediate results. For at-home kits, the timeline varies, but you may start seeing results within a few days to weeks, depending on the product's strength.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Before and After Results

One of the most striking aspects of teeth whitening treatments is the visual transformation. Before your treatment, your teeth may appear dull, stained, or discolored due to a variety of factors, such as:

- Diet choices (coffee, tea, wine)
- Tobacco use
- Age-related discoloration
- Certain medications

After the treatment, you can expect to see brighter, whiter teeth that can improve your overall appearance. Many patients report feeling more confident and even experience a change in how others perceive them. The impact is often more significant than just aesthetics; it can enhance your self-esteem and motivate you to maintain good oral hygiene.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Maintenance After Whitening

After experiencing the exciting before and after results of teeth whitening, it‚Äôs essential to maintain that new smile:

- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to keep your teeth clean.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit consumption of foods and drinks known to stain teeth.
- **Routine Dental Check-ups:** Regular visits to your dentist will help keep your teeth healthy and your smile bright.
- **Consider Touch-ups:** Depending on your whitening method, you might require touch-up treatments to keep your smile radiant.

People who invest in their smiles often find themselves embracing a newfound enthusiasm for life. The outcomes from visiting a teeth whitening dentist can be transformative, not only for your teeth but for your overall confidence and well-being.

The journey from before to after teeth whitening showcases the power of professional dental care. With dedication to maintenance, your smile can continue to shine brightly for years to come, making it a worthy investment in yourself.

The Science Behind Teeth Whitening: What to Expect From Your Dentist
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has gained immense popularity in recent years, becoming a go-to treatment for those seeking a brighter smile. If you're considering this cosmetic dental procedure, understanding the science behind it can help you know what to expect from your dentist.

When you visit a teeth whitening dentist, the process typically begins with a thorough examination of your teeth and gums. This is crucial for determining if you are a good candidate for whitening. If you have tooth sensitivity, gum disease, or dental restorations, your dentist will discuss alternative cosmetic options that could be safer for you.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
During the examination, your dentist will also discuss your dental history and personal goals for whitening. This conversation is essential, as it allows your dentist to recommend the best type of whitening treatment tailored to your needs.

### Understanding the Whitening Process

The actual teeth whitening process employs various methods, each backed by scientific principles. Here are the most common options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-office whitening:** This is the most effective method and usually involves the use of a higher concentration of whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide. The dentist applies the gel to your teeth, which may be activated by a special light to enhance the whitening process.
- **At-home kits:** Dentists may provide custom whitening trays along with a lower concentration of bleaching agents. You wear these trays for a specified amount of time each day for a few weeks.
- **Over-the-counter products:** These are easily accessible but tend to be less effective. They include strips, gels, and toothpaste but may not provide the same results as professional treatments.

### What Happens During Your Appointment?

On the day of your whitening appointment, it‚Äôs essential to arrive with clean teeth. Your dentist will start by performing a professional cleaning to remove plaque and tartar that could hinder the whitening process. After this, they'll take a few minutes to protect your gums, which typically involves applying a rubber dam or a protective gel around the gum line.

Your dentist then applies the whitening gel, which penetrates the enamel, breaking down stains effectively. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the treatment used. It‚Äôs not uncommon to relax and listen to music or watch TV during this time.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### What to Expect After Treatment

Once the treatment is complete, you should notice immediate results. Many people leave the dentist‚Äôs office with teeth that are several shades whiter. However, keep in mind that results can vary based on the initial color of your teeth and the method chosen.

It‚Äôs essential to follow your dentist's aftercare advice. For instance, you might be advised to avoid certain foods and beverages that could stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, and red wine, for a short period after treatment. You should also continue your regular dental hygiene routine, including brushing and flossing.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Potential Sensitivity

One question many patients have is about sensitivity after whitening. It‚Äôs not uncommon to experience some temporary sensitivity, especially if you have naturally sensitive teeth. This usually dissipates within a few days. Your dentist may provide desensitizing agents or recommend over-the-counter treatments to ease any discomfort.

### Long-term Results

To maintain your bright smile, you should adopt a proactive approach. Regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene, and lifestyle changes can extend the life of your whitening results. Additionally, consider touch-up treatments every few months or as recommended by your dentist.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Teeth whitening is a scientifically-backed procedure that can significantly enhance your smile, provided you understand what to expect. By working closely with your dentist, you can achieve dazzling results safely and effectively. Remember, a bright smile is not just about aesthetics; it can boost your confidence and leave a lasting impression!

### Conclusion

Experiencing the transformative results of teeth whitening can significantly boost your confidence and enhance your smile. Many individuals find themselves pleasantly surprised by the before and after differences showcased in various case studies. These visual transformations highlight how professional teeth whitening procedures can bring about a striking change, making teeth several shades lighter and delivering that radiant smile everyone longs for.

Understanding the science behind the teeth whitening process is essential for setting the right expectations. Your dentist will use specific techniques suited to your dental needs, ensuring both effectiveness and safety. Whether through in-office treatments or take-home kits, the results can be profound, often revealing a smile you never thought possible.

I met up with my friend for a winter cycling adventure‚Äîyes, because apparently, I enjoy being a human popsicle. The plan was simple: ride through the park, feel the burn, and grab a coffee at the end. A typical winter day with friends.

But there was one small issue‚Äî*I forgot my chocolate bar*. You know, the one thing that could make the cold bearable, the sacred treat that keeps your spirit alive when you're more snowman than human. And, of course, I realized this tragedy about five minutes into the ride.

""Hey, I forgot my chocolate bar,"" I announced dramatically, already feeling the cold bite into my bones.

 Jacob, the ever-optimistic (and slightly annoying) one, laughed. ""You sure you didn‚Äôt just eat it all before you got here?""

I shook my head. ""No.....

As we pedaled, the cold got worse. My fingers were starting to feel like frozen sausages, and my nose was redder than Rudolph‚Äôs. We stopped for a quick break, and I stood there, shivering, hoping someone would offer me some of their snacks. Jacob pulled out a bag of chips. good...

But, alas, no chocolate bar. No warm feeling inside. I began contemplating life choices, like why I thought cycling in freezing temperatures was a good idea.

Finally, we finished the ride, and the first place we hit was the caf√©. I could already taste the warm coffee in my mind. As we sat down, I looked at my friends, still shivering slightly, and said, ‚ÄúNext time, I‚Äôm bringing two chocolate bars. One for the ride, one for my sanity.""

As we sipped our coffees, I realized that maybe, just maybe, the real chocolate bar was the friends who froze with you in the winter cold. Or maybe not.

It was acting like it had the zoomies, grabbing stuff and running around and seeing that the locals seemed unfazed by it, I didn't feel the need to be on edge around it, but then it came up to me, grabbed my heel and lightly bit it. I barely felt it, it didn't break skin from what I could tell. It almost felt like a playful bite, but now I'm paranoid. I went to a local clinic to get the rabies vaccine, so far I've gotten day 0 and day 3, with day 7 scheduled for December 26th but the doctor felt I didn't need the immunoglobulin shot because the bite didn't draw blood. My concern is that I may have put myself at higher risk by touching the area that I was bit and then touching my eye/mouth/nose without disinfecting the area. Should I have gotten the immunoglobulin shot? Is it too late to get it? Am I overreacting by thinking I should get it just because I may have touched the uncleaned bite area and then touched an orifice? The anxiety is truly killing me.

After extensive testing, no specific underlying cause was identified (e.g., kidney issues), and I was prescribed 2.5 mg of beta blockers. Over the summer, my blood pressure dropped, but with winter, it returned to borderline levels, prompting a return to beta blockers.

I have a stressful job, even more so back then, and on top of that, I bought a fixer-upper house, which, as any homeowner knows, always demands attention and adds to the stress. On the positive side, I prioritize a healthy lifestyle, eating as well as possible and exercising almost daily, including mountain biking, rock climbing, and yoga. I‚Äôve reduced my caffeine intake to one coffee in the morning and drink non-caffeinated tea afterward. I consume alcohol sparingly, usually just a beer or two or a couple of glasses of wine.

However, taking regular blood pressure measurements causes me anxiety. I‚Äôm seeking insights from others who have faced similar experiences‚Äîhow do you cope with this condition?

Some background. I do have a hearing disability (severe hearing loss in one ear) since childhood. Probably was born with it. My parents didn't know until I was around 5 years old which is when I started wearing a hearing aid.

On first date, I did bring it up about my hearing aid which she seemed okay with. However, after the 1st date and we talked on the phone next day, my date asked me some bizarre questions such as: ""Have you ever had genetic testing done?"" , ""Any relatives with hearing issues?"", ""Have you ever been bullied in childhood due to your hearing aid?"", ""If someone were to present a word on a piece of paper to you, can you speak the written word?"". I kinda stumbled to these questions and felt kinda annoyed. Especially the last question. I mean, I am a dentist after all, I know how to say words from a piece of paper, lol. I understand women are going to be curious and ask questions but I felt these kinds of specific questions were improper.

Should I bother seeing her again or give her a chance? It just comes off she may lack kindness/empathy over a superficial thing and somewhat neurotic about it. What do you think?

I had a few USD cash from a previous trip (like 150), some CRC on my Wise account and my credit cards. Using an ATM to grab cash was fast and smooth but I only had to do it once.

When my phone blipped the notification and I saw like R$ 150 (like 23 USD) I was like ‚Äúoh wow, I got scammed. Ok.‚Äù¬†

* **Transfer**: Interbus van at 8:25 AM.
* **Accommodation**: Art Hostel Costa Linda, Parque Nacional Manuel Antonio, 60601.
* **Lunch**: Magic Bus food trailer.
* **Activity**: Walk and relax at Espadilla Beach.
* **Dinner**: Hostel's restaurant.

**December 19th ‚Äì Manuel Antonio**

* **Morning Activity**: Espadilla Beach (drone flight).
* **Lunch**: Namast√™ Indian Restaurant.

As I walked back to the hostel, looking at something on my phone, I felt someone tap me on the shoulder a little harder than necessary. I looked up, startled, and it was the towel guy. ""Remember me? From the towel yesterday?"" with a huge smile on his face, probably hoping to sell me some new overpriced item. I replied, ""Yes, you charged me 12,000..."", to which he replied, visibly embarrassed, ""I'm sorry, friend..."" so I just let it go.

* **Afternoon Activity**: Biesanz Beach.
* **Snacks**: Purchased from a local supermarket.
* **Dinner**: Hostel's restaurant.

**December 20th ‚Äì Manuel Antonio**

* **Morning Activity**: Manuel Antonio National Park (self-guided).
* **Lunch**: Varuna.
* **Afternoon Activity**: Espadilla Beach.

So I‚Äôm bodysurfing here and watching my things at the beach from time to time (don‚Äôt know if I was naive, but it felt safe to just leave it there besides a log or hanging on a tree) and I see the lifeguard taking people away from the beach and telling them to walk to other section of the beach. I find it weird, ‚Äòcause I‚Äôve been taken away from places at the sea by lifeguard before, but never from the beach itself. So I catch a wave out of the ocean and approach the guy to ask what‚Äôs wrong, and he tells me: go over there, there‚Äôs turtle hatching!  
  
And it was one of the most magical moments of this trip. See little turtles hatch and make their ways to the sea for the first time, unexpected and absolutely for free? Awesome!

* **Dinner**: El Avi√≥n.

**December 21st ‚Äì Manuel Antonio**

Only day that rained most of the time, so I took an Uber to Quepos for lunch and walked around, bought some last time small gifts for family.

* **Morning Activity**: Relax and brief walk at Espadilla Beach.
* **Lunch**: Soda S√°nchez in Quepos.

**December 22nd ‚Äì Manuel Antonio ‚Üí San Jos√©**

* **Transfer**: BookAway transfer at **12:30 PM**.
* **Accommodation**: Costa Rica Backpackers, Avenida 6, Calle 21 y 23, 10104.
* **Activity**: Explore neighborhoods like Barrio Escalante or Am√≥n.

**December 23rd ‚Äì San Jos√©**

* **Transfer**: Hotel-to-airport at **11:15 AM**.
* **Lunch**: Mastercard Black VIP Lounge at SJO Airport.

So now for what I would do different: definitely one more day at Monteverde, probably to visit El Tigre. Wouldn‚Äôt stay another night at San Jose coming back, I‚Äôd use it at Manuel Antonio or La Fortuna to ziplining or something. If you plan your schedule well, you can go back directly from Manuel Antonio to the airport. I feared not having enough time and came back a day early.

And that wraps it up! I was worried about the weather ‚Äòcause like everyone else I was following this sub about the rains, but it was really good. La Fortuna as hot and humid. Monteverde was chill and windy. Manuel Antonio was REALLY hot and humid. So every time it rained it was quick and helped to cool down a little bit. I‚Äôm not one to go back to previous countries, trying to visit new ones every time I can, but I would definitely come back to Costa Rica, explore other regions. There‚Äôs just so much to do, so much variety. Nature is exuberant (and I‚Äôm from Brazil, don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by nature that easily), the food is great and people are absolutely the best! Pura Vida!

My (31F) husband (34M) has been unemployed for two years. We were both in the army and he left after 10 years because it took a huge mental and physical toll on him. It took a huge toll on me too, but I was faring better so I stayed to support us while he recovers. After he left the army, I saw a new side to him that I wish I saw years ago. Since we've always supported each other well, I told him I don't mind if I'm the only one working until he gets his bearings...transitioning back to civilian life can be a huge shock for some. He initially felt bad about this, so I just told him I'd love if he could help around the house a bit more. He enthusiastically agreed and said it still doesn't feel like enough but he'll be the ""best househusband [I] ever saw"". 

He ended up doing just the opposite. He started with playing video games for the whole day until I got back. He would forget any household task I asked him to do until I'd come home and remind him. Months pass, it slowly gets worse and he starts saying that these tasks are hard because he's still depressed. I set up an appointment with him to see a therapist...on the day he was supposed to go, I came home to find out he never went. He also started spending waaay more money during this time...mostly on microtransactions in games and computer upgrades, despite many talks about how we can't afford that. 

At one point I had to leave for an entire month for a field exercise...when I came home, dirty and tired, I opened the door to a horrible rotting smell and a fly/ant infestation. Dirty dishes were overflowing on every counter and table in the kitchen. Take-out containers littered the floor. He laughed and said ""it's a little messy here, I know"". He was not trying to make a joke. He ACTUALLY only considered that to be only ""a little messy"". And then he asked me if I could help him clean, while I had JUST come home from laying in the mud and dirt for a month during the winter and just wanted a hot shower. And he was asking me to clean up after him. I broke down and cried because I've had enough of feeling like I'm financially supporting a child. I told him he's not going to bed until he cleans everything. Then I told him I can't stay with him while he's like this. He started to panic and told me he didn't even notice how far down he had gotten...he told me I'm not obligated to change my mind on staying with him but he will do whatever it takes to be better. 

For the next three months, he actually went through huge strides to improve. He started going to therapy. He started setting alarms to remind him what to work on in the house without me reminding him. By this time, I had pretty much changed my mind on leaving him. And just as things were going better, everything in my life changed all at once. 

On a morning run with my platoon, I suddenly collapsed and couldn't stand back up. It's like my legs didn't know what my brain was trying to tell it. After the problem didn't go away with rest, I went through a series of tests over the course of a month. During that time, I completely lost my ability to stand. My head constantly felt like someone had swung a hammer at it. After an MRI, a brain tumor was found. It's been a living nightmare, but this post isn't about that. 

Obviously, everything changed very quickly. I became extremely weak in a short amount of time. And now my husband had to support me full-time. TV and video games just make my head worse so I'm stuck in bed with my own thoughts all the time. I can't even wheel myself to make coffee without passing out. So you can imagine how much I now needed to rely on my husband. 

He stepped up and was wonderfully caring...for the first month. Then it started with him leaning towards bringing instant meals or junk food instead of meals...I'm not picky and I still felt guilty about needing help, so I said nothing at the time. And then he slowly went back to his video game routine. I didn't always have the strength to call out to him for help so sometimes it would be hours until he'd check in. Then he started forgetting to feed me. Dinner would sometimes be at 9pm or later because he would be lost in his game...he would come running and apologizing with the food. Sometimes I had passed out and he didn't realize because he was playing his games. Same apologies. He started telling me about tasks he'd done (i.e. ""I did all the dishes"") only to find out later that he didn't, and told me he did because he assumed I can't check. 

The final straw...or what would NORMALLY be the final straw...is the fact that after a big argument about him sinking $700 into one game, ending in him promising he'll never do it again, I just found out that not only did he do it again a week later, he had spent over $1000 on microtransations this time. He's still unemployed. He also tried to lie about it to my face, telling me that it might be a fraud purchase before I showed him the proof I had. 

When I had a working body, I would have left by now without turning back. But this time, I don't know what to do. I'm now entirely physically dependent on someone living with me while I wait for a possible surgery date. And I've already been waiting for a year. He hasn't been taking great care of me but at least someone is still around to make sure I don't pass away alone. And the little he does help with is still incredibly difficult to do on my own. But he's clearly not going to change. I don't know what my options are.

We've all been there, right? Mid-conversation, you get that little nagging feeling‚Ä¶ is my breath okay? Bad breath, or halitosis, can be a real confidence killer. It‚Äôs a common problem, and while mints and gum offer temporary fixes, sometimes you need something more. This leads many people to search for home remedies, and one that pops up frequently is hydrogen peroxide. So, does hydrogen peroxide kill bad breath? Let‚Äôs dive deep into this bubbling question and explore everything you need to know.

Does Hydrogen Peroxide Kill Bad Breath? A Deep Dive
---------------------------------------------------

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let‚Äôs establish what we're dealing with. Hydrogen peroxide is a common household antiseptic, known for its bubbling action when applied to cuts and scrapes. It essentially works by releasing oxygen, which can kill some bacteria. But is that enough to tackle the root causes of bad breath?

### Understanding the Culprits Behind Bad Breath

To answer our main question ‚Äì does hydrogen peroxide kill bad breath ‚Äì we first need to understand *why* breath goes bad in the first place. Think of your mouth as a bustling city. It‚Äôs home to a diverse population of bacteria, some good, some not so much. These bacteria feast on food particles and produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which are the primary culprits behind that unpleasant odor. Other factors contributing to bad breath include:

- **Poor oral hygiene:** Skipping brushing and flossing creates a buffet for bacteria.
- **Dry mouth:** Saliva acts as a natural cleanser, so reduced saliva flow can lead to a build-up of bacteria.
- **Certain foods:** Garlic, onions, and coffee can leave a lingering smell.
- **Medical conditions:** In some cases, bad breath can be a symptom of an underlying medical issue.
- **Smoking:** Tobacco use dries out the mouth and leaves behind its own unpleasant odor.

### The Science Behind Hydrogen Peroxide and Bad Breath

Now, back to hydrogen peroxide. It *can* kill some bacteria in the mouth due to its oxidizing properties. This bubbling action you see? That‚Äôs the release of oxygen, which can disrupt the bacterial cell walls. However, there's a catch. While it might temporarily mask the odor, it doesn't address the underlying causes of bad breath. Think of it like putting a band-aid on a broken bone ‚Äì it covers the problem, but doesn't fix it.

### The Potential Risks of Using Hydrogen Peroxide for Bad Breath

Using hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash might seem like a quick fix, but it comes with potential risks:

1. **Tissue damage:** Hydrogen peroxide can irritate and even damage the delicate tissues in your mouth, especially if used in high concentrations or too frequently. This can lead to gum inflammation, soreness, and even ulcerations. Ouch!
2. **Disruption of the oral microbiome:** While targeting bad bacteria, hydrogen peroxide can also harm the beneficial bacteria that are essential for a healthy oral environment. This can disrupt the delicate balance and potentially lead to other oral health issues.
3. **Tooth sensitivity:** Prolonged use of hydrogen peroxide can weaken tooth enamel, making your teeth more sensitive to hot and cold temperatures. No one wants ice cream to become a painful experience!

Does Hydrogen Peroxide Kill Bad Breath? Alternatives for Fresher Breath
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, if hydrogen peroxide isn't the answer, what is? Thankfully, there are much safer and more effective ways to combat bad breath:

- **Proper oral hygiene:** This is the cornerstone of fresh breath! Brush twice a day for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste and floss daily to remove food particles and plaque.
- **Tongue scraping:** Don‚Äôt forget your tongue! It can harbor a significant amount of bacteria. A tongue scraper can help remove these odor-causing culprits.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and keeps your mouth moist, preventing dryness that can exacerbate bad breath.
- **Regular dental checkups:** Visiting your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups is crucial for maintaining good oral health and identifying any underlying issues that may be contributing to bad breath.
- **Chewing sugar-free gum:** This can stimulate saliva production and help freshen your breath temporarily.

Does Hydrogen Peroxide Kill Bad Breath? Addressing Underlying Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, sometimes bad breath can be a sign of something more serious. If you‚Äôre concerned about persistent bad breath, don‚Äôt hesitate to talk to your doctor or dentist. They can help determine the underlying cause and recommend the appropriate treatment.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

### Natural Remedies for Fresh Breath

Besides the standard advice, some natural remedies can also help freshen your breath:

- **Chewing on fresh parsley or mint:** These herbs contain chlorophyll, which has natural deodorizing properties.
- **Drinking green tea:** Green tea contains antioxidants that can neutralize bad breath-causing compounds.
- **Rinsing with saltwater:** Saltwater can help kill bacteria and soothe irritated tissues.

### Long-Term Strategies for Banishing Bad Breath

Ultimately, the key to conquering bad breath lies in adopting long-term healthy habits:

1. **Quit smoking:** If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your overall health and your breath.
2. **Maintain a healthy diet:** Limit sugary foods and drinks, and focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
3. **Manage stress:** Stress can sometimes contribute to dry mouth, so finding healthy ways to manage stress can also benefit your breath.

Does Hydrogen Peroxide Kill Bad Breath? The Verdict
---------------------------------------------------

While hydrogen peroxide might offer a fleeting moment of freshness, it‚Äôs not a sustainable or safe solution for bad breath. In fact, it can do more harm than good. Instead, focus on the tried and true methods: good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups, and a healthy lifestyle. These are the true secrets to a confident smile and fresh breath that lasts.

Conclusion:

So, does hydrogen peroxide kill bad breath? The short answer is: temporarily, maybe. However, it's not a recommended solution due to potential risks and its inability to address the root causes of the problem. Embrace a holistic approach that includes proper oral hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, and regular dental visits for long-lasting fresh breath. Don't fall for quick fixes that could end up causing more problems down the line. Your breath (and your mouth) will thank you for it!",1,1735110051.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

I am at a loss for words and have no idea how to write this year's letter to you.

I miss you so much. I'd kill to hear you laugh, to drink a coffee with you, to puff tough together, and to hug one another.

So much to say and an inability to spill.

I'm having trouble leaving my house. I do it, but I don't stay many places longer than thirty minutes, before feeling crushing anxiety and fleeing back to the safety of my solitude.

A month ago, my mental health was in the gutter. I was starting to scare myself. I had given so much of myself to one part of my life and ignoring other parts (family, friends, things that are good for me). The part I was giving to, was not giving anything healthy to me. I let someone traumatize and beat me the fuck down.

I can't elaborate yet.

A decade.

It's been ten fucking years since I last spoke with you, laughed with you, cried with you...and even though I know the answer, I ask myself how this can be? Fucking stroke

I owe you more words than you're getting tonight.

I love you

To my Housewife Family... please know F.A.S.T

FAST stands for¬†Face, Arm, Speech, and Time, which is a mnemonic used to help identify and recognize the signs of a stroke.¬†

Face:¬†

* Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the face, such as drooping or difficulty smiling.

Arm:¬†

* Sudden weakness or numbness in one arm, making it difficult to raise or keep it lifted.

Speech:¬†

* Slurred speech, difficulty speaking, or trouble understanding words.

Time:¬†

* If you notice any of these symptoms, it is **crucial to act quickly and call emergency services immediately**.¬†Time is critical in treating a stroke, as the sooner medical attention is received, the better the chances of recovery.

Remember, it is important to seek medical attention even if the symptoms seem temporary or resolve on their own, as a stroke can be a serious medical emergency.

I'll preface that I really enjoy the changes that came with this update and like a lot of the big swings TIS went with. It felt like I was playing the game for the first time all over again.

I made a burglar and started out in Rosewood. Hopped the back fence of the fire station and wore myself out clearing out the building. I hotwired a box truck in the parking lot and destruction derby'd the horde by the police station. Early game was heavily based on using shitter cars to clear important areas (fire station base, grocery store, gas station) and slowly built my two-handed skills while hording loot.

The first month was spent doing a full clear and loot of the town. Power last until day 28ish but I never found a generator magazine. So I was in the dark from then on. The handful of basements had a couple old stoves, which was nice to not have to raid warehouses/random cabins. I relied on a propane stove for most of my cooking and water purification needs though. I didn't have a reliable source of wood early on.

After that, I started doing farther runs looking for a hiking bag as my main goal. I was making due with like 6 duffle bags and was tired of it. I hit up the Doe Valley army surplus and hiking shops and only found a hydration pack + a chest rig (made to hold a couple magazines for a handgun). Found a big hiking back off a survivor zombie a week or so later. Picked up a sledgehammer for a road work event on a country backroad. Installed some windows in the dark spots of the fire station. Ran a 3 day hiking trip out to the secret military base southwest of Rosewood. Scored a military bag plus ALICE straps for the handsfree flashlight.

Eventually I ended up spending some days in March Ridge looking for survivor homes/vehicles hoping for a generator magazine. Got some air tank masks from some fire fighters. Stumbled on and explored the bunker behind the school. Real Fallout Vault vibes. Poked my head in the school before I ran the minimal loot I found back to base. Got scratched by a couple of zombies in a bathroom and lost the 95% chance. Second time I ever got touched by a zombie.

===

I like that the game really wants to span out character progress to the long term and I think it is headed in that direction well. Needing to perform skills to grow them feels good instead of just disassembling a million of the same thing. And needing to find recipes made me want to go out on looting runs even more. Couple that with growing times taking up to 240 days on some plants, I could see someone getting to multi-year runs. It's pretty exciting. 

The varieties to all the items and spawn rates now make the world feel much more diverse. Looting never really got stale as there was always something new to find. Plus, I felt like I could be more expressive with my character. I really went hard on the burglar theme. Ended with a gold ingot, a small gold ingot, 5 money stacks, a stock certificate for the sea horse coffee chain, \~25 encumbrance of gold rings, plus like another 15 in other gold jewelry, and a legally distinct non-Rolex watch and pocket watch. 

My favorite thing was fishing in the pond near the Drive-In Theater, west of the gas station and bus terminal. Spent one day and caught 3 fish so small I couldn't make fillets from them but hit level 1 fishing. Came back the next day, caught a dirty rag in the morning and spent all day with no bites. Until at 19:00-ish I had a crazy struggle and landed a ""Medium"" Paddlefin  that was 131cm and weighed \~45. I basically had to strip to get it out of my truck when I got home and filet it. Each fillet weight 22 and provided something like 150 hunger/nutrition each. It was wild. The new fishing minigame is really satisfying and weirdly tense when worrying about random sneaky zombies.

The only gripes I have are minor bug things, that I'm sure will get ironed out before the full release. Like, my car's batteries would reset to their initial charge amount every night. So I couldn't keep anything above like 30% power. Couldn't figure out adding a sleeping bag to a tent. Crafting station constructions couldn't be picked up after being built. Pots and buckets not heating up if they are in a stove before it gets turned on. Other little number tracking things not tracking right (had a propane tank claim to be empty but weigh as much as a full tank for example).

Notable exploits I found: 

1. Removing a filter from a respirator before it went empty would give me a fully charged filter, that I could plug back in. I never had a situation where I was in stink for so long I got any negative effects. Filters burn out really fast as well. So I'm curious if there's a location that necessitates their use on a relative rate.

2. I tried to butcher a rabbit that was in a duffle bag on the ground. My character pulled out the bunny, butchered it, got meat (+ bunny head), but could then butcher it again for endless meat. It only fixed itself after I picked up the body and chose to butcher it from my inventory.

PS - Randomized zombie AI, toughness, and speed as the default felt amazing and I'll be doing that from now on. Really breaks up and challenged my old kiting methods.",5,1735109891.0,projectzomboid,0,0.86,False
1hlvovy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlvovy,A delicious experement gone right,"Thanks to u/gordo1223 for posting his the other day about his pour over stack. I looked up the materials, messed up on some things and made it work.
This is in multiple stages:
Hario drip assist: to make the brew a control and not a variable
Frozen metal ball: as close to the end of the cup as possible
Funnel into a wine airator: I was a bit stumped on how to best make it work since the ball would block the output of the funnel, I didn't have any wire like gordo1223 does. I used a mallet and bent in a place for the ball to rest letting the coffee flow around and down the funnel. Supposedly the airator makes it taste lighter or more tea like but the combo is quite the custom job having to cut up the funnel to make it all fit. I couldn't find measurements for the funnel beforehand and I didn't want to return it to the Amazon return garbage dump. 

I always weigh my brew water and as a flip of the script. I cannot have the scale under the cup anymore, now I'm weighing negative grams from the kettle and eyeing my pours.

The two coffees I've had from this so far, decaf project sugarcane process last night, and Nicaragua Acopio Suyatal this morning were both some of the best coffee I've ever had in the past 10+ years of actually enjoying coffee and constantly improving. 

Total cost for this upgrade from just a v60 and the usual kit was $68 including tax which looking back on was 100% with it to me.

I have some affairs to sort out. Need to clean my garage so there's no mess for Mum to deal with, throw out and subtly give away some stuff, and organise a will so that Mum gets my house, or what's left when it's sold by the bank.

It's 4:25pm Christmas Day. I'm just back home after spending 4.5 hours helping a stranger. I got to hear all about her amazing family, career, the massive amount of money she just came into, the study she is doing, her goals and dreams for the future.

I will never have any of that. I have mental health issues, physical health issues, a deformed freakshow body I hate that has ruined my life, and a life of abuse and trauma that has Just. Never. Stopped.

I've been home 5 minutes and I'm just sitting here crying my eyes out, smoking a cigarette, drinking an iced coffee, and posting my bullshit to strangers on the internet pointlessly because noone gives a fuck and on the off chance someone does there's nothing they can do.

I'm going to mow the lawn this afternoon. Clear out my spare room tomorrow. Throw out any embarrassing stuff like sex toys and kink stuff. Clean out the garage under the house, organise the stuff I want to give away - I'll just tell A I'm having a big clean out and disposing of things that nonlonger serve me. He won't know I'm referring to my life, and that's good.

Once Christmas and New Years is done I'll make an appointment to do a will. I'll do it properly with a lawyer, not some shitty do-it-yourself will kit, so it's easy for Mum to sort out with J's help.

I'll hoard the valium I have left until then, I don't have amything like enough to kill myself but I have enough to take to give me the peace to do a 300km/h+ run on my bike into a rock wall I've picked out. I can round the curve before at about 220km/h so should be pretty close to the 300k mark by the time I hit the end of the straight, and the T-intersection. Exact speed is a moot point, a dead stop from anything like that speed ill be safe from this world, finally, and there's no chance I'll miss a 50 foot wide rock face at the end of a massive straight and nowhere for me to accidentally tumble or slide to some form of badly injured survival.

I'll do it in the middle of the night, it's already pretty remote but that fraction of a second I'm crossing the road late at night it's practically impossible that the one car an hour would be passing at that exact millisecond, so there's almost zero chance I impact anyone else.

With a stop like that from 300km/h I'll be dead on impact, but will wear full leathers so hopefully there's no more soup for emergency services than is necessary. Most of me should remain bagged up fairly neatly.

I'll call emergency services right before I do it, so they know it's a suicide, and to look for my note and will at home.

It's going to hurt Mum, but she knows how much I've suffered and that it's what I want. She has another son who is a real man, who has a wife and a career and has given her grandchildren. She won't be alone and it will hurt but she will know I'm finally at peace.

I just wish I could fast-forward to this next bit, I am so excited and can barely wait.

Drinking and chatting we start talking about how things ended and the healing process and those we met in our adventures. We let everything out on the table for the universe to hear forever, and then...silence...darkness...candles...musical temptations with silhouetted teasers...

I come to you today with a humble request and a bit of a wild idea. I‚Äôve got an F7C Mark II, but I‚Äôve been dreaming of creating my very own F7A- (yes, with the dash‚Äîit‚Äôs important for flair). However, to make that dream a reality, I need an F7A Mark II to borrow briefly. I promise, I‚Äôm not planning to fly it into a sun or reenact a dogfight scene from *Wing Commander*. I just want to strip the ball turret (and maybe a few other parts) to Frankenstein together my masterpiece.

I‚Äôve asked around before, but no luck so far. So here I am, taking to Reddit, hoping someone out there with a generous spirit (and an F7A) might lend me a hand‚Äîer, ship. I promise not to leave coffee cups in the cockpit! Feel free to send me a friends request also. :P

Thanks for reading, and may the quantum drives always be in your favor!

1hlvh0v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlvh0v,AIO to think I ruin my friend group,"I (18F) have a close group of friends since highschool, now we started college/University and it's strained friendships. The main deal was, most are upset I didn't go to community with them and instead went to my family's alma mater. We all live fairly close and still get together.


I had some trouble making friends in uni since my parents won't let me live on campus so I went a bit overboard with the few new friends I did make.
This got twisted and people thought I was ditching them for ‚Äúbetter people‚Äù which was not it at all.  I did try to make some distance with one of my old friends, they started saying things that weirded me out. So the whole ‚ÄúI'm some entitled princess and don't care about them got worse‚Äù


I still went to plans made by me and others but leaving early is what always bothers them. This last get together my ride bailed and I decided to get over myself and spend the night.
 

Problem is I didn't spend the night and woke up at home in my bathroom covered in towels.
I can't remember shit
Like nothing
I don't know if I was messy, or was a bitch, or crazy. All I got to go by is the messages from what I assume is right after I got picked up from my friend hosting.


And my brother is absolutely no help. All he told me was he didn't say anything to our parents and then not a word. He won't even look me in the eye.
I keep pushing for details but he's ignoring me.


Now I'm here at a family get together spiraling while hoping my stare will let through to my him or he gets drunk enough to spill. I seriously want to strangle him.


Nobody is explaining anything!
I feel like I'm going insane. I send messages but there is no reply, my phone calls go to voicemail. 



Snapchat has some blurry pictures at 1am of what I can make out as the coffee table, we were playing card games at one point.
Maybe I was super obnoxious and they called my brother but why would my friend be pissed off if he picked me up.
I'm assuming the black eye was over exaggerating 
My brother doesn't like that particular friend. I'm so upset and can't think. I gave up texting everyone earlier today.


How do I even begin to fix something I have no idea what I did. I bought concert tickets for everyone as I'm sorry for ditching last time. Do I buy something else? I can't say sorry if they don't talk to me.
Sorry if this is all over the place.


TLDR: planned to stay over after a party, ended up home, can't remember what I did to cause people to ignore or block me. How do I go about finding it out and saying sorry? Am I freaking out for no reason?

Do opposites actually attract? ,"Hi everyone, my bf and I have been together for a year and we get along but he‚Äôs been recently asking to get more serious (aka move in together and meet each other‚Äôs parents) but I‚Äôm worried that we‚Äôre not meant to be and I don‚Äôt want to get more serious if we‚Äôre bound to break up. We seem to be innately very different people, but we‚Äôre both easy-going so it‚Äôs been working well enough? Since he‚Äôs been asking to get more serious though, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking (perhaps overthinking) and I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be happy long term. 

For background, he‚Äôs an only child who spent a lot of his childhood alone and grew up nerdy without a lot of friends. He‚Äôs had one other serious relationship and they ended up living together for almost a year before he broke up with her. I‚Äôm an eldest daughter who has ‚Äúlived 100 lives‚Äù as he puts it, but has never moved in with a boyfriend. We‚Äôre also at that age where everyone around us is getting engaged and married and I think that he wants to get there too, as do I, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs to him‚Ä¶ The clock is ticking and I don‚Äôt want to get more serious if we‚Äôll end up breaking up. Additionally, he currently lives with his parents even though he makes 100k+/year. He doesn‚Äôt love living at home but is doing so to save money to buy a house, which is very very expensive (1M+) where we live. I bring this up bc I‚Äôm worried he only wants to move in with me bc he wants to escape living with his parents. 

I am more extroverted and I like to do things - doesn‚Äôt have to be extravagant but I like to make the most out of my day, whether that be running errands, going to the mall, checking out a market, grabbing coffee, maybe even baking decorating a gingerbread house (since it‚Äôs the holidays). He is self-admittedly more ‚Äúboring‚Äù - he enjoys sitting at home watching movies, watching YouTube, playing video games. If I ask him to do something with me, he‚Äôll do it, but occasionally complain. I keep finding myself sitting on the couch watching 2-3 movies in a row with him bc that‚Äôs what he likes but I‚Äôm bored out of my mind and I couldn‚Äôt care less about what movies were watching. 

Another issue, I‚Äôm generally not that talkative of a person but he is extra silent, which makes me the ‚Äúyapper‚Äù in the relationship. It‚Äôs fine bc I‚Äôve been putting in that effort and actively trying to make conversation with him all the time but today on a long drive, when I don‚Äôt put in that effort, we just sat in silence. I understand, that comfortable silence is fine but I‚Äôm a little sad that it seems like unless I ask him a bunch of questions, he doesn‚Äôt have anything to say, ever. I‚Äôll even ask him ‚Äúwhat are you thinking about‚Äù when he‚Äôs been quiet for awhile but he‚Äôll always respond with ‚Äúnothing‚Äù or something generic like ‚Äúyou‚Äù. 

This brings me to what bothers me the most: we spend time together but I don‚Äôt feel that close to him. When we hang out at my place, we end up just sitting there watching movies and not doing much else. We do talk a bit more on dates but the convos are pretty surface level (how was your day? Any plans for the week? Maybe a funny anecdote etc.) I‚Äôve tried asking him questions that I think are important when considering a lifelong partnership like finances, goals, why are you attracted to me, what‚Äôs going well/not well in our relationship so far etc. but he always says that these are ‚Äúheavy topics‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy ruin a nice day‚Äù. I think what I‚Äôm feeling is a lack of emotional connection. 

There‚Äôs a bunch of other things we don‚Äôt really align on (having kids, spending habits, music taste, traveling style) but this post is already getting long so maybe I‚Äôll make a pt. 2 if need be. 

WITH ALL THIS SAID, it‚Äôs not all bad though, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing to me. He‚Äôs good to me and very kind. He‚Äôs takes me on nice dates, on trips, and buys me gifts and we have never reaallllyy fought or argued (Although, sometimes I wonder if we just don‚Äôt bring up what annoys us about each other for fear of confrontation). He‚Äôs easy to be around and he‚Äôll come with me to do things if I tell him it‚Äôs important to me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being ungrateful and focusing on our differences or if we‚Äôre just truly not meant to be. 

Sometimes when I bring things up he‚Äôll say stuff like ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt care, would I have taken you on a trip?‚Äù I understand what he‚Äôs saying but I don‚Äôt want him to point to things he‚Äôs done/bought in the past to make up for the fact that he doesn‚Äôt communicate with me. Hes also previously admitted to not being really emotional bc of how he was raised and how he grew up and I want to be understanding of that. 

A very recent example, although it may seem frivolous, he gifted me something really nice for Christmas but then gave it to me in the bag he bought it in and without a card. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt write a card, and that to me, the card is the most important part because he‚Äôs never written one to me yet and I want to know how he FEELS. I was hoping that since he doesn‚Äôt speak much, maybe he could write down his feelings? He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really do cards, but I‚Äôll write you one for our anniversary.‚Äù I guess we‚Äôll wait and see. 

Am I being a psycho gf or should we break up before things get serious? 

Tldr: my bf is nice to me and buys me things but I don‚Äôt feel an emotional connection because he doesnt REALLY talk to me. Should we continue to date and move in together? ",1,1735108445.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve never been superstitious, and I, technically speaking, still had no reason to be. If you‚Äôve read my last post, you could be thinking the same thing. There‚Äôs nothing in there that I‚Äôve described that could not have some sort of rational, mundane explanation. The odd handprints could possibly be from some harmless prankster. The cats could‚Äôve gotten spooked because cats just get spooked by nothing sometimes. The gust of wind I felt could‚Äôve just been a gust of wind on an otherwise calm night. Even the voices could‚Äôve come from some asshole that missed their calling as a voice actor or ventriloquist. The could‚Äôve heard my wife and I talk before and just figured out how to mimic us. I really wish I could believe all that. I really do. But RocksAnn and I have an awful gut feeling that most, if not all, of the recent shenanigans and goings on are part of one real life paranormal horror show. And the show must go on.

  After that night, we stopped seeing the handprints on our vehicles and windows. We started seeing them around the house instead. On countertops, the walls, the tv, the couch, the fridge even. We also started finding bare footprints. Our guest was feeling free to make themselves at home, it seems. And our cats; they all started behaving differently. Rorschach, our kitten, became increasingly skittish. Normally, he hated being in his cage, which was where we fed him. He was always crying and nagging to get out as soon as he finished eating. Now he was reluctant to come out, and when he did he preferred to stay under the couch. H√§agen-Dazs behaved similarly, but with more aggression. Often she would stare and hiss and something that wasn‚Äôt there, or at least nothing I could see, she would calm down after that but still stare in the same direction. Tarrare, though, seemed relatively undisturbed, her only thing being that she seemed to run around more, and was just a little more frantic. She was always the more, well, simple of our cats, happy as long as she got her meals on time. 

  My wife and I were both in sorry states. For one thing, our house was freezing now. No matter how high we put the heater, we felt like we were in Alaska, despite living near the border of Mexico. There was a heaviness to the house now. It felt like our souls stayed at the door and we were husks inside our home. We spent a lot of our time outside, going for long walks, sometimes til our feet burned. We didn‚Äôt like being in the house. We didn‚Äôt like our cats being there either, so until we could figure out our situation, we took the cats to my in-laws. It was a chore explaining why we needed them to pet sit when we weren‚Äôt going anywhere. After hearing about the handprints and the cold and all the rest, they thought our house was demon infested. Wasn‚Äôt surprised to hear it from them. They were very religious to the point they were at times reluctant to purchase secondhand items out of paranoia about whether or not they would unwittingly buy something demon-possessed. 

  ‚ÄúBy now the whole house must be infested,‚Äù said Rosa, RocksAnns mother. ‚ÄúOnly thing you can really do now is move out and let it have your house. You don‚Äôt want it to have your souls.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt that simple,‚Äù RocksAnn said. ‚ÄúWe moved here because we can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere else right now. It could be years before we‚Äôre able to make any kind of move.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù I put in. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure what exactly it even is. How do you know it‚Äôs a demon and not something else? Maybe it‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhatever you think it might or might not be,‚Äù Rosa rebuffed, ‚ÄúDo you really think it has good intentions towards y‚Äôall?‚Äù

  It was hard to argue with that. It felt like we were being toyed with in our own house. That feeling wasn‚Äôt made any better the next morning when I walked into the kitchen. As I grabbed a mug to make coffee, I found something new on the counter. Dirt, but not a handprint. It was an arrow. It pointed to the kitchen window, and toward the cemetery. I heard a shatter. When I looked at the floor, I only then realized that, in my shock, I had let my mug slip from my hand. If that arrow didn‚Äôt signify malevolent intent, I don‚Äôt know what did. Either our stranger wanted to kill us, or he wanted us to finish the job ourselves. I showed my wife what I saw, and we could only sit in stunned silence. My wife was in a numb state. She was staring blankly out the window. I was the opposite. Anxious and fidgety, I almost jumped out of my skin every time I heard the smallest sound. I would‚Äôve been shivering even if I wasn‚Äôt freezing cold. Finally RocksAnn spoke.

  ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do about this?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt the first time either of us asked that question, but we needed a final answer, an answer I didn‚Äôt have.

  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Even if we try to move, we‚Äôre gonna have to be in and out of the house for a while.‚Äù 

  ‚ÄúAll the more reason to start moving now,‚Äù she urged. ‚ÄúHow long can we stay before we‚Äôre driven insane?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I sipped my coffee. Everything tasted more and more the same each day. Murky. ‚ÄúI wish we didn‚Äôt have to spend one more day here. Or night.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than being here forever,‚Äù she was still staring out the window. Finally she looked at me. ‚ÄúMy parents are offering to let us stay in their trailer until we can find a new place. It won‚Äôt be ready until tomorrow, so we‚Äôll have to make do with one more night here, unless we can afford a motel.‚Äù

  We could barely afford two days of groceries right now much less a motel. ‚ÄúOne more night it is,‚Äù I replied.

  We tried to spend most of our time out of the house. We walked at the park, went by the thrift store, went by the post office, anything to keep us out of the house. Eventually though, we had to go back home. We actually fell asleep a little more easily that night. Maybe knowing that we would soon leave this nightmare behind set our tired minds at ease. 

  Sometime in the middle of the night, my slumber was rudely interrupted. I awoke in a sneezing fit. It wasn‚Äôt really surprising, I had allergies off and on. I went to the kitchen for tissues. When I touched my face though, my shivers from the past days melted away in a white hot rage, though I was still scared to the bone. I felt dirt on my face. I‚Äôd had enough. 

  ‚ÄúGet out of our damn house!‚Äù I shrieked at the top of my lungs. I heard my wife run to the bedroom door before I finished my sentence. ‚ÄúGet out! Get out now! Leave us the fuck alone! I swear I‚Äôll burn this house down with you in it!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhat happened?!‚Äù, my wife asked.

  I grabbed her hand and placed it on my face.

  ‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù was all she could say. 

  ‚ÄúThis thing stole our home. It‚Äôs stealing our life away.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt let it take anymore,‚Äù she assured me as she held me close. After I calmed down I noticed something. 

  ‚ÄúRocksAnn, do you feel something?‚Äù I asked.

  She looked at me with a nervous look on her face. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúExactly. The cold is gone.‚Äù Her eyes lit up once she realized.

  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think-‚Äú she began.

  ‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre safe now?‚Äù, I finished. ‚ÄúToo early to tell. I guess we‚Äôll see over the next few days maybe.‚Äù

  We spent the next several days in the house. Miraculously, everything seemed back to normal. The chill was gone. We didn‚Äôt find any handprints or footprints or anything inside or outside. Most importantly, we felt alive again. Actually alive in our own home. We couldn‚Äôt figure out why though. Why was one show of outrage enough to banish the stranger? As it turns out I‚Äôd get more answers than I hoped for.

  One afternoon, while I was washing dishes, I found myself gazing out the window and towards the cemetery. It still looked quiet and peaceful despite everything. My musings were interrupted by a familiar sounds. The same pawing I heard the night I let the stranger into our house. It was slower this time. My heart dropped at the noise. I couldn‚Äôt stomach the thought of going through all this again. No way I was going to let it in again. I heard something else though. My wife‚Äôs voice, not talking, but sobbing. Then they sobbed in my voice, then in both of ours. Another cruel joke to toy with us. RocksAnn, who‚Äôd been in the living room, was by my side now. We listened to the pawing and the crying. What if it didn‚Äôt stop? Or what if it came back again and again? While it cried, it spoke in our voices. 

  ‚ÄúI-I-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶s-s-sor-sor-ry,‚Äù it groaned. ‚ÄúD-Did not-t wan-nt‚Ä¶hurt-t. On-nly w-want h-hel-p. Pl-ease. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶c-cold.‚Äù

  RocksAnn and I looked at each other. We were taken aback by how they spoke, not that they used our voices, but how they used them. They sounded absolutely pained. And that last thing they said. Were they really living such a miserable existence?

  ‚ÄúP-please!‚Äù, they started again, ‚ÄúF-find g-grave. Dig.‚Äù The sobbing faded, and so did the cold chill by the door. My wife and I talked throughout the rest of the day about our experience. We went back and forth over whether this was some kind of trick, or our stranger really did need help. Even if they were sincere, what could we do? Obviously they wanted us to find and dig up a grave, what for, we couldn‚Äôt say. We eventually decided it couldn‚Äôt hurt to drop by the cemetery. So that‚Äôs what we did the following morning. We took a walk through the cemetery, not knowing what we were looking for. We combed over every tomstone, hoping our stranger might‚Äôve left some kind of sign. Our search paid off after maybe an hour or so of looking. One tombstone I can‚Äôt remember who it belonged to, it had a dirt arrow on it, pointing to its right. We followed the aisle of stones further, until we came to a small plot with a dirt handprint on its stone. It had one name on it: Stan. There was no year of birth, nor any statement about the person or his life. Their year of death was 1893. RocksAnn and I felt the chill return for a brief, silent moment, then it was gone again. 

  After another lengthy discussion that afternoon, my wife and I came to a decision. We were going to help this stranger, Stan. We didn‚Äôt like the thought of defiling a grave. But if we didn‚Äôt, Stan might never be done with us, and whoever he was, we didn‚Äôt want anyone to be doomed to an eternal lonely cold. That night, we took a shovel and found Jeremiah‚Äôs grave. RocksAnn held the flashlight while I started digging. It was a cold night, but not freezing. I guess Stan decided it best not to disturb us. It didn‚Äôt take long until I hit an old and worn wooden coffin. After clearing away the dirt I pried it open with the shovel. What we saw inside will haunt us more than anything else that happened prior. The body was so small. It couldn‚Äôt have been more than ten years old at the time of death. This stranger, this kid, had been wandering cold and alone for well over a century. Had he ever tried to ask anyone else for help? If he did, it hadn‚Äôt worked until now. 

  What did he need now? We dug up his grave. Was there more we had to do? We decided to look in his tattered pockets for anything to clue us in. To my surprise, I did find something. RocksAnn shined a light on the small stub of paper I‚Äôd pulled out. It was a train ticket. This poor kid must‚Äôve been wanting to go home, and never made it back in life. We weren‚Äôt sure if this was what he wanted now, but we couldn‚Äôt figure what else it could be. So we covered his grave, and booked it to the old dilapidated train station. It was currently being reconstructed, and passenger trains never stopped here. We didn‚Äôt know what we expected to happen, but we stepped onto the platform with the ticket and waited. Before ten minutes had passed, a mist set in and covered the ground. It rose to our knees, and in the dark, the platform and track were completely invisible to our eyes. Then we heard the blaring of a train horn. No, not a horn. It was the howl of a steam whistle, coming from our left. The sound of it rumbling along the tracks filled the air and grew louder with each passing second. That was when he finally approached. Stan‚Äôs cold chill filled the air once more, but it was different now. The cold wasn‚Äôt so oppressive now. It felt lighter, more endurable. I hoped it was for Stan too.

  We never saw the train. We didn‚Äôt see it stop at the platform, though we heard it slow until its wheels screeched to a halt. We didn‚Äôt see Stan step aboard a passenger car, though the chill of his presence vanished, and the ticket in my hand whisked away in a sharp breeze. We didn‚Äôt see the old locomotive begin its departure, though we heard the cry of its whistle which then echoed through the cold desert night, and felt the smoke from the engines smokestack in our lungs. We didn‚Äôt see the train vanish into the night, though the galloping of the engine and its cars slowly fades into the distance. We saw nothing on that platform but a mist that came and went. We saw nothing, but RocksAnn and I both knew it was over. I hoped our stranger made it home safely.",2,1735108251.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He‚Äôs takes me on nice dates, on trips, and buys me gifts and we have never reaallllyy fought or argued (Although, sometimes I wonder if we just don‚Äôt bring up what annoys us about each other for fear of confrontation). He‚Äôs easy to be around and he‚Äôll come with me to do things if I tell him it‚Äôs important to me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being ungrateful and focusing on our differences or if we‚Äôre just truly not meant to be. 

Sometimes when I bring things up he‚Äôll say stuff like ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt care, would I have taken you on a trip?‚Äù I understand what he‚Äôs saying but I don‚Äôt want him to point to things he‚Äôs done/bought in the past to make up for the fact that he doesn‚Äôt communicate with me. Hes also previously admitted to not being really emotional bc of how he was raised and how he grew up and I want to be understanding of that. 

A very recent example, although it may seem frivolous, he gifted me something really nice for Christmas but then gave it to me in the bag he bought it in and without a card. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt write a card, and that to me, the card is the most important part because he‚Äôs never written one to me yet and I want to know how he FEELS. I was hoping that since he doesn‚Äôt speak much, maybe he could write down his feelings? He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really do cards, but I‚Äôll write you one for our anniversary.‚Äù I guess we‚Äôll wait and see. 

Am I being a psycho gf or should we break up before things get serious? 

Tldr: my bf is nice to me and buys me things but I don‚Äôt feel an emotional connection because he doesnt REALLY talk to me. Should we continue to date and move in together? ",2,1735108138.0,relationship_advice,11,1.0,False
1hlvceq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphysicalWeather/comments/1hlvceq/winter_day_4_hyperreality_and_dreams_within_dreams/,Winter Day 4: Hyperreality and Dreams Within Dreams,"I had a near-death experience in autumn 2002, and since then, a metanarrative has dogged me about how all that‚Äôs happened since ‚Äì 22-plus years ‚Äì has been a kind of business of the soul as my actual body is scooped off my girlfriend‚Äôs bathroom floor where the NDE occurred, though in the time line over yonder, I am ambulated to a local hospital where doctors determine that a neurological event has transpired ‚Äì as with certain notions about nested realities, the one I‚Äôve been in since 2002 is proceeding at a different rate than the one where I had the stroke. In the land of the actual, some number of hours have elapsed, by now possibly days. Is this a casualty reality? Do souls come here while some chasm appears in their experience of reality? I woke up during mine, was awakened, at least two sources of authority creating the world around me ‚Äì

a dream within a dream within a near-death bubble universe, like we‚Äôre trying to hide out from something. Once I started adding them up, surveying my past life against the present, I came to see a few deathly experiences sprinkled in ‚Äì disremembered bumps in the road, accidents and near accidents. My life came to feel subterranean, like each potential death, each time I neared death again, was like finding some new lower point for the water to pool, ever lower chambers in the making, where the soul might dwell, at least until the medical staff in the adjacent reality stabilizes my situation. Part of my hyperreal performance involves being in two places at once, the phenomenology of one reality bleeding into the other. I heard the ambulance, the medical staff, the beeping of my pulse. I‚Äôve been started by hearing my own name whispered in my ear.

Earlier today, I was handwriting in public about an experience with the hyperform when a vivid conversation behind me, the only one in the place, wound up with the sentiment: so basically he‚Äôs on life support, and they‚Äôre waiting for him to come around. Am I? Are they? What a thing to hear in a sleepy coffee shop. I  wondered how I might be helpful to the other reality, the one hoping I regain consciousness, possibly waiting for me to croak. I imagined my pragmatic family of origin in 2002, my dad and my oldest brother running the numbers, deciding on some three-week plan to let nature take its course, see if I recover. Some timewise conversion chart would plot out a history of a few hundred years from those three weeks, during which time humanity constructs a utopian road out of modernity and into the cosmos, a kind of public works project.

All of this was far more apparent when it all first happened back in 2003-04, and death was like a phase of the moon. Back then, I was being led to another way of life, which I failed to achieve in every sense except metaphysically, where I encountered a new aspect of nature, new islands of life based on probabilities instead of bodies, an authority circumscribing natural law, thereby implying laws of a higher sort. Whether I‚Äôm really in two places at once, balanced between fate and its opposite, or witnessing the hyperform tell another story by multiplying the meanings of the phenomena around me ‚Äì I can be sure sources of strange authority are always coming and going from the scene. Perhaps I can write a short prayer for them when next I prepare to rest ‚Äì Oh, universal love!

During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck with a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.

In my early 20s, life felt full of possibility. I believed I had something great to offer, that over time I would find my way to the right places, I believed in myself as an artist. I would go out to bars and parties and feel excited hoping that I would have a good time. I was sure over time I‚Äôd meet lots of interesting people and find my community. Any dream I dreamt of, I felt hope and optimism that it could happen and it would be great.


Now, I‚Äôve lived enough life to realise that none of these dreams actually come true, and if they did, I probably wouldn‚Äôt even enjoy it due to my introverted and HSP nature. The dream of travelling and being a performance artist? Well, that would actually suck because I sleep like shit in new environments and I would just be exhausted all the time.

Th expectation of having a good time when you go out to a bar or party? I‚Äôve been to enough now that I‚Äôll probably spend it quiet in a corner and feel disconnected from everything around me.

Belief in myself as an artist? Bruh, my way of seeing the world is divergent and strange to most - it‚Äôs too childish for contemporary fine art spaces - I‚Äôve networked and showed my work to enough gallerists to know it‚Äôs not a fit.

Finding my way to the right spaces and people? I severely underestimated how much you need to be well liked to get anywhere, and I‚Äôm the sort of person that takes a lot of time to get to that level with others. 

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve now lived enough to see through dreams and hope.  I‚Äôve cycled through careers and dream jobs and know that they don‚Äôt hold joy for me.

And now I find myself in space of emptiness where I simply don‚Äôt know what would actually bring me joy? What is there to hope for? 
I find solace in small things and I ground myself in them, this keeps me going - like sunshine, swimming, evening walks, coffee and birdsong. But it feels like that‚Äôs all I have.

I wonder if this is a natural cycle of getting older. And I wonder if a sense of optimism and joy will ever return? ",7,1735107343.0,hsp,3,0.9,False
