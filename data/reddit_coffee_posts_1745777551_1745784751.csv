1k9d7d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slovakia/comments/1k9d7d0/mental_breakdown_v_tescu/,Mental breakdown v Tescu,"Pred pár hodinami tu niekto postoval  mental breakdown zakazníka v kauflande, tak aj ja sa podelím o môj najoblubenejší ešte cca z roku 2014 ktorý niekto napísal na priznania tinedžerov. Vždy ma sa kosím od smiechu ked si na to spomeniem tak hadam pobaví aj vás :DDDD

⸻

Prídem dnes do toho jebnutého Tesca. Jediné, čo som chcel, bolo kúpiť si v pokladni cigy a zároveň rozmeniť drobné. Slušne som sa spýtal tetky prijebanej, čo základnú školu skončila len protekciou, že či bude taká láskavá a počká so svojím dvojvozíkovým nákupom, kým si za 20 sekúnd kúpim cigarety.

„NIJEEE!!“
Ja tu stojím pätnásť minút a nebudem čakať navyše.

A k tomu ešte aj ochotný škuľavý turbok*kot brigádnik mi povie:

„Aj tak cigarety nemám.“

„A to nad hlavou je čo?“

„Nemám od toho kľúče.“

No k*kot…

Otočím sa, v Coffee&Co mladá blondínka, chvíľu pozorujem, ako jedným nechtom umýva poháre a potom vitrínu so zákuskami… och, ako ma vzrušuje salmonela! Hodím na ňu to jedno zdravé oko, že moja, rozmeň mi desinku. Tiež p*čuje, že nemá, ale nejako sa mi podarí na ňu hodiť aj to druhé oko a nakoniec privolí. Dostávam vytúženú dvojeurovku a hor sa pre vozík. To, že som zasa našiel taký, čo píska, vŕzga a jedno koliesko sa netočí, nestojí za reč.
30 minút hádžem k*kotiny do vozíka, od jogurtov po deostick, cez pivo, voňavú k*kotinu na záchod. Keď už tam mám utešenú kôpku, prídem k pokladni a jebne ma. Instantne ma jebne. Otvorená bola PRESNE JEDNA!!! JEDNA VYJEBANÁ SKURVENÁ POKLADŇA. V strede. A od nej sa tiahol had jak sebavedomie Ibrahima Maigu, cez celú šírku Tesca. No nech nepreháňam, bolo tam minimálne 35-40 ľudí, z toho tak 15 ľudí malo vozíky naložené kopcom. Oblieva ma studený pot, v duchu rozmýšľam, že no čo, otvorím si pivo a budem si čítať noviny.

Pri poslednej pokladni stoja tri p*če skurvené predavačky, z toho neviem, či jedna nebola vedúca. Tak ku nim prídem a vtom nejaký mladý pán predo mnou sa ich pýta:

„Prosím vás, v čom je problém?“

„V ľuďoch.“

Do mňa vošli jedy 4000.

„Pani, my vieme, že nie v tom, že vám ráno nedoniesli mlieko, ale v ľuďoch, ale prečo vy tri tu stojíte s kávou v ruke?“

„Nám o desiatej padla.“

„Je 21:50.“

„No ja už do pokladne nepôjdem…“

Do toho sa zasa zapojil ten vedľa stojaci, ale dostal rovnako milé odpovede:

„Kedy otvoríte ďalšie pokladne?“

„Možno o 10-tej prídu nejakí ľudia.“

„To tu vážne necháte tých ľudí stáť v tom rade?“

„To neni môj problém…“

Okej, jebem na ľudí, nie som Chuck Norris vyjebaný nesmrteľný.

„Dám vám 10 eur, keď mi toto tu nablokujete.“

„Ja nie som odkázaná na vašich 10 eur!!!!!“

Ojebalo ma okolo toho vozíka, až sa to koliesko pojebané začalo znova krútiť… Chytám vozík, z celej sily doňho jebnem, až sa prejebe k informáciám… nech si ho nejaký chuj ide zasa povykladať… Ešte tam po nej v záchvate ziapem, že nech sa nečuduje, že celý život sedí za pokladňou, lebo niekto jej ponúka 300 korún za 5 minút roboty, čo keby som mohol, si za to do pokladne sadnem aj na rok… ale nie, p*ča má hrdosť a mletú kávu v hrnčeku so sloním k*kotom namiesto ucha.
Cez zatvorenú pokladňu chcem prejsť, otvorím tú kokotinu zátarasu, spustí sa alarm, úplne hnusný zvuk. Vtom pribieha šedivý pajdajúci k*kot SBS-kár a už sa po mne chňape… Revem po ňom, že keď sa ma dotkne, tak jeho vlastnými plastovými putami ho pripútam k tej pokladni. Aj tak ma zdrapí za ruku, odtlačím ho a idem do p*če… Niekto vypol ten alarm, môj sused s úsmevom taktiež prešiel tou pokladňou… Znova spustil alarm, zaželal vrátnikovi, aby mu to vrieskalo až do rána a ideme preč!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tu prisahám na vlastnú smrť, pohyblivosť svojich spermií a poštové tajomstvá, že do Tesca v Poprade minimálne 1 rok nevstúpim… zapičenci zapičení vyjebaní, a takýchto kokotov ešte niekto podporuje, niekto z mojich daní nejakými úľavami, dávkami a pičovinami, lebo k*kot vychodí základnú školu a nevie ani rožky cez pokladňu prejebať!!!!!!!

Going to be in Athens for 2.5 days in early June. I'd love a little feedback on our itinerary. I'm going with one other buddy, two mid-30s men from Austin, Texas with a pretty flexible budget. We want to walk around, see antiquities, draw stuff, and soak up the culture. We're planning to stay in Koukaki, something like ""Regal Hotel Mitropoleos"", or ""Athens Studios"". Is Koukaki the move? Is Plaka a better idea for any reason? We're artsy guys, would love some rooftop cocktails and trendy coffee while we're there walking around. 

Itinerary: 

Weds afternoon: (landing at 10am, cab to the hotel)   
Acropolis, Parthenon, Acropolis museum. We hope to check out Anafiotika. 

Thurs:   
Agora, Hadrian's library, Lycabettus for sunset. 

Fri:   
National Archaeological Museum 

Then we leave early Sat morning for 6 days on Crete. Any suggestions, ideas, places to eat or drink, are all super welcome. thank you! ",1,1745784496.0,GreeceTravel,0,1.0,False

My (27F) partner (27m) (together 1 year) and I got into an argument today. He drove me home from his house  and was helping me replace the thermostat on my car. I went to grab my iced coffee and take a sip and it was 100% spilled. Naturally, I was upset, disappointed (I live over 40 mins from any services and get the chance to eat out/ get iced coffee once every 3 months so it’s a very special treat to me) and relayed my sadness to him. His response (without even looking up from his phone) was “ah that sucks” then continued to do what he was doing. It upset me and I asked him a couple minutes later if we could talk. (I feel so silly bc this is all literally over a coffee..) I explained that the way he responded made me feel dismissed and like he didn’t care about my feelings. He instead of apologizing or trying to make it right, said that’s just “who he is” and he was distracted because he was trying to watch a video about the thermostat replacement, and he cant “always drop what hes doing to pay attention to me). The issue is, I feel like he does this ALL THE TIME and then minimizes my emotions when I talk to him about how much it bothers me (which  I have done, very calmly and clearly, several times.) well things got a little heated and I told him he never pays attention to me (not 100% true) and he said I make everything about myself, im over reacting & its annoying how I always “have to have things go a certain way”. Am I like being immature and over reacting????  is he gaslighting me because he never can stop what hes doing to see what im pointing out or just simply look over or listen for one freaking second…I don’t always expect him to drop everything and immediately be at my beck and call, but I feel like he NEVER does, like not even 2% of the time, and I do that for him. Anytime I point out something in a song or walking by, like “omg did you hear/see that \_\_\_\_” he always says “no” and doesn’t even look over. And when I bring up issues to him  he says im “assuming his intentions” and I flat out told him today that im not “assuming his intentions” but im only telling him how his actions made ME feel, as a result, and that doesn’t make him a “bad partner” but that I just want to be able to talk about uncomfortable stuff and our feelings and it not be about blaming it just needs to be about repair. But it ended up with us talking over each other (mainly him causing it and me only doing it bc I couldn’t finish what I was saying due to being interrupted) and then a yelling match and him leaving slamming the door on his way out.

1k9d448,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k9d448/looking_for_this_book_tittle/,Looking for this book tittle,"I thought my husband was broke. For three years, I paid for everything—rent, groceries, even his morning coffee.

Once, while we were out shopping, I saw a $20 purse I liked. He took one look and said it was too expensive.

Then one day, by sheer accident, I found out he bought his first love a $4 million diamond necklace—for her birthday.

Turns out, he wasn't drowning in debt like he led me to believe. He was actually the heir to a billion-dollar empire.

...

I got home late after a long shift, took a quick shower, and collapsed onto my bed. I was scrolling through my phone when a notification popped up that made my heart stop.

""Popular actress Isabella Montgomery receives a $4 million diamond necklace from a mysterious tycoon for her birthday.""

My hands trembled as I zoomed in on the photo.

You couldn't see his face, just his back, but after three years of marriage, I'd know him anywhere. The dark mole behind his ear gave him away.

It was Ethan. My husband.

Four million dollars. I couldn't even wrap my head around that kind of money.

Just a few days ago, we were out shopping when I spotted a $200 handbag I really liked. Ethan immediately said it was too expensive and gently talked me out of buying it.

I did the math, $200 could buy a ton of tissues or last us weeks in groceries. So I let it go.

Now, I could barely breathe.

Ethan and I met online.

After chatting for a couple of months, we met up, hit it off instantly, and fell hard. On Valentine's Day, he got down on one knee with a soda can tab fashioned into a ring and said he'd buy me a real diamond once he made it big.

I said yes. Not for the diamond, because I loved him.

He told me he was an orphan, raised in a group home. He'd tried starting a business, but it failed, leaving him over a million dollars in debt. So we kept our wedding simple.

We rented a tiny apartment, and I paid the bills. I also covered most of our day-to-day expenses.

To make ends meet, I worked full-time during the day and picked up night shifts waiting tables.

His entire salary went toward clearing his debt.

I remember him once pulling me into his arms and whispering, ""Thank you for giving me a home, Audrey. I've never been this happy.""

He cried as he said, ""Once I pay everything off, I'll buy you a house, a car... I'll give you the life you deserve. I'm so sorry you have to suffer with me.""

I kissed him and told him, ""As long as we're together, I'm already happy.""

I meant every word. Back then, I thought I was the luckiest woman alive.

Ethan was handsome, kind, didn't smoke or drink, and treated me like I was his whole world. Aside from being broke, he was perfect.

I thought if we both kept grinding, we'd get through this.

But now? Now I couldn't stop crying.

Then, right on cue, a text from Ethan lit up my screen.

""Business is good tonight, Audrey. I'm staying out late to make more for the debt. Don't wait up, get some rest.""

He worked as a courier during the day and sometimes picked up gigs as a designated driver at night.

If I hadn't seen that photo, I would've believed every word.

So why was he lying?

I didn't sleep a wink. Ethan never came home.

The next morning, I got ready in a daze and stepped outside. Just as I was about to leave, I froze.

Across the street, I spotted someone I knew too well.

Ethan.

I ducked behind a tree, peeking out as he stepped out of a Bentley. Gone was the sleek suit from the night before, now he was back in the cheap T-shirt and jeans I'd bought him.

A middle-aged man handed him a plastic bag, steamed pork buns and soy milk.

My favorite breakfast.

Just then, another car pulled up. Out stepped the CEO of a big tech firm. My friend worked at his company.

He walked over to Ethan... and bowed slightly.

I blinked, stunned. That man had a reputation, he was powerful, ruthless, respected.

Why was he acting like a junior intern around my husband?

A minute later, Ethan called.

My screen lit up: ""Husband""

Tears blurred my vision. I took a breath and picked up.

""Hey, Audrey. I got you your favorite, steamed buns and soy milk.""

""I had to head in early today. You eat without me, okay?""

His voice sounded so normal. So warm.

""Alright,"" I said softly. ""I'll eat later.""

""I'll cook something nice when you get home,"" he added.

""Okay.""

I hung up and texted my boss to take the day off.

I wasn't going to work today.

I was going to find out who my husband really was.

I camped out at a coffee shop across the street, eyes fixed on our building.

Around noon, Ethan finally came out.

He got into the Bentley. I pulled on a mask and flagged down a taxi, tailing him from a distance.

We stopped at an upscale restaurant, white-glove service, valet parking, the works. The moment the car pulled up, the valet practically sprinted to open the door. Ethan tossed him the keys like he'd done it a hundred times.

I followed at a distance as he disappeared into a private dining room.

Inside, I could see a group of guys already seated, young, smug, dressed in expensive suits. The kind of people who were born into money.

I pretended to be on a call and lingered near the door.

They ordered big, lobster, king crab, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. Dishes I'd only ever seen on YouTube.

Meanwhile, at home, Ethan refused to throw away leftovers and insisted we eat them two days in a row.

Laughter burst out from the private room.

""Ethan, you look hilarious in those cheap clothes. The heir to a fortune dressing like a broke college kid, classic!""

""How long are you gonna keep up this act? Don't tell me you're seriously into that country bumpkin wife of yours?""

Then Ethan's voice cut through:

""Please. Audrey's just a toy. Something to kill time. You think I'd fall for someone like her?""

""I told her I was a million in debt, and she actually believed it. She said she'd suffer with me to pay it off. God, she's the most gullible woman I've ever met.""

They all roared with laughter.

And in that moment... it felt like my heart had been ripped out and stomped on.

Bleeding. Broken. Unrecognizable.

Chapter 2
I thought I was his true love, but I was just his pawn.

Even our happy marriage had been nothing more than an illusion he'd carefully crafted.

Ethan Sinclair wasn't some orphan struggling to make ends meet. His story of going bankrupt and being deep in debt? A complete lie. His family was wealthy, influential.

And then I overheard voices from the private room.

""By the way, I heard Isabella was thrilled when she got the necklace you sent her last night. She even wants to get back with you. Don't you think she'd be heartbroken if she found out you're married?""

""Serves her right! She dumped Ethan to chase her acting career abroad.""

""None of you know the real reason Ethan married that country girl—it was for revenge against Isabella.""

My body froze, my breath catching in my throat.

He didn't love me. I had been nothing but a tool to hurt someone else.

I clutched my chest, feeling my heart crack open.

Isabella Montgomery—his first love. Back then, his parents had disapproved of her acting dreams, so she left him.

Afterward, Ethan decided all women were untrustworthy, so he made a game out of manipulating their emotions, dating one after the other. Finally, he settled on marriage—to get back at Isabella.

But afraid his wealth would attract the wrong type of woman, he hid his identity and chose someone plain and ordinary.

And I was the fool who fell for it.

Isabella was the one who had wronged him, not me. So why had he destroyed my dignity like this? Why had he trampled on my heart?

A suffocating wave of pain hit me. Just as I turned to leave, I heard another voice from inside the room.

""Mr. Sinclair, what if Audrey finds out the truth?""

Ethan's voice dripped with disdain. ""She's too busy working to support me. She doesn't have time to care about anything else. After work, she runs to the market to buy discounted groceries just to cook for me.""

""If she finds out? Doesn't matter. I'll make sure she signs the divorce papers—empty-handed.""

All the color drained from my face.

And then I saw her—Isabella, stunningly dressed and glowing, walking toward the private room. The moment she entered, the room lit up with compliments.

By pure chance, a waiter opened the door to serve the dishes, and I caught a glimpse of Isabella sitting next to Ethan, their gazes locked in an intimate exchange.

She touched the diamond necklace around her neck and smiled coyly. ""I love the necklace. Thank you, Ethan.""

His lips curled into a slight smile. ""As long as you like it.""

How generous he was with his first love—a four-million-dollar necklace, given without hesitation.

Yet, in his eyes, I wasn't even worth a two-hundred-dollar handbag.

I couldn't bear to hear any more. I stumbled out of the restaurant, nearly losing my footing on the steps.

Outside, the tears came—hot and fast, the sobs wracking my body as I finally let myself fall apart.

For three years, I had loved Ethan with everything I had.

I worried about him working too hard, so I'd made nourishing soups to keep him healthy.

I stuck to cheap skincare, saving every penny to buy him nice clothes and shoes—lying that I'd gotten them with online discounts.

And he'd praised me for being clever.

But the truth was, I had been a fool.

By the time I made it home, the night had fallen. Ethan was in the kitchen, cooking.

When he heard me enter, he looked up with that warm smile of his. ""Honey, you're back. Dinner's ready.""

There he was, wearing an apron in our tiny kitchen. It was hard to believe he was the heir to a billionaire fortune.

As he stirred the pan, he chirped, ""The fish was fresh today. The vendor even gave me a two-dollar discount.""

""Oh, and I sold all the cardboard boxes I'd saved up for two weeks—made sixty-eight bucks. After groceries, I still have five left.""

I closed my eyes, the pain in my chest almost too much to bear.

He'd gone to such great lengths to keep up this charade.

The table was set with four dishes and a soup. In the past, I would've rushed to him, calling him the best husband in the world.

But now? All I felt was bitterness.

I remembered what I'd overheard at the restaurant and clenched my fists. Ethan had learned to cook—for Isabella.

Yet, he'd told me he only started after marrying me.

He'd also claimed he grew up unloved, hungry, and bullied—that he wouldn't have survived without charity.

I had felt my heart break for him.

But none of it had been true. Not a word of it.

Not even when he said he loved me.

Tears started streaming down my face.

Ethan set down the dish and hurried over, concern filling his eyes. ""Honey, did something happen at work?""

When I didn't answer, his frown deepened. ""Talk to me. Who upset you? Seeing you cry like this breaks my heart.""

""Once I start making real money, you won't have to work anymore. Just stay home. I'll take care of you.""

He kept calling me ""honey,"" his handsome face filled with worry—as if he actually loved me.

Was he for real? Because all I could think was he was full of crap.

My lips trembled as I asked, ""Ethan, do you love me?""

He smiled tenderly. ""Of course I do. You're the woman I love most in this world.""

I stared into his eyes, thinking of every cruel word I'd overheard in the restaurant—each one a bullet to my heart.

He looked down on me. He saw me as nothing more than a stepping stone to get back at Isabella.

So when he said he loved me, all I felt was disgust.

1k9d3vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnBHosts/comments/1k9d3vy/guest_gifts/,Guest gifts,"Hi all. I’m new to hosting and want to leave a great guest gift or gift basket. I currently leave snacks and chocolate in a basket at the tea/coffee bar. I leave amenities like soap/shampoo/conditioner and lotion in the bathroom. They get a sleep mask and ear plugs and lotion in a little mesh bag tied with a ribbon on their night stand. I also have a cabinet organized with lots of things that guests can take if they want like phone chargers, individually wrapped tooth brushes, travel size items…

It seems like the things often out in gift baskets are things I’m already providing and so it seems redundant to have in a gift basket. I’d love some feedback on these ideas. 

-sparkling grape juice (I have a recovering alcoholic in my family and I cannot bring myself to have a bottle of wine or champagne there without expressed permission and that kind of ruins the surprise, right?)

-Cupcakes with ingredient list and cupcake picks that are specific to our state. 

-Fresh baked cookies with ingredient list. 

-Fresh flowers 

-Teddy bears and coloring books for kids

I’d appreciate feed back on these ideas and any others you may have. Thanks!

1k9d1ti,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9d1ti,I need help with my room! Kuromi Inspired Room,"I've been trying to find a good layout for my room ,but even though my room is moderately spacious I still feel if I incorporate the things I want it's going to be very busy and crouded. I don't think my layout is that tricky but I think I am so used to seeing it that I can't really think outside the box. I have a lot of plushies as well and I really don't know where to put them.

Note: I have a built-in wardrobe from the side that you guys can't see in the photo ,but I added it to the layout sketch on the last photo.


Here's the things I want:

1. I want my room to have LED lighting and decorated like Kuromi from Sanrio vibes. I want the character in but It's more to explain the vibe I'm going for. Like a gothic-gaming setup but more futuristic? Idk if I am explaining it well😭
2. TV (probably mounted on wall)
3. Gaming setup (already have one but want to upgrade)
4. Couch (already have one but i want to make it fit better with my aesthetic)
5. A double sized bed (i have a single one for now)
6. A display for my figures (a better one in a better position)
7. Coffee table
8. THE CHAIR IS TEMPORARY my office chair broke and I'm stuck with that for now :')

Will all these fit? I'm not sure. If you guys have any ideas ,or how to use my space in a more smart way please feel free to tell me. 

Also if you feel like you want to add more furniture or erase stuff please tell me!

I have attached my room and the rough sketch I created for the layout. 

I have been trying to find a good layout for so long that I'm literally burnt out😭

Thank you in advance!

1k9cyu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1k9cyu1/how_do_they_expect_us_to_be_grateful/,How do they expect us to be grateful???,"I think it's pretty common for APs to expect their children to be eternally grateful to them and have this concept of a debt that can't be paid simply because they raised us. Mines are basically the same but is it weird that I cannot feel an ounce of gratefulness to them? Maybe it's because I'm a terrible person with no empathy and sense of debt, but I think it's because of the way they treat me.

My APs, especially my mom, are narcissitic control freaks that try to judge and dictate everything I do. From the time I was young to now as an almost 30 year old male, they're constantly on my case about every action. Let me tell you about an example of why I can't feel indebted to them. When I was a senior in high school, I wanted to build my own PC so I put together a list of components and their costs to present to my parents. I had enough saved up for it which up till now I have only owned shitty hand me downs from my dad, but my mom objected, saying she wanted to buy it for me instead because I shouldn't be wasting my money. Sure, that's something anyone would be happy about right? Well being the all knowing god she is, she set a condition, actually several:

1. She had to pick the one to buy
2. I had to sleep at 10 pm everyday
3. I had to use it outside and not in my room

I vehemently opposed, saying I had saved up enough. A huge fight broke out and she threatened all kinds of stuff like throwing me out. I ended up letting her buy me a shitty laptop that took 5 years to open microsoft word on and barely ran anything. Anyways, that's the similar tone of things for most of my life. Whenever I wanted to do something or buy something, they would always step in to propose a ""compromise"" which involved them setting heavy restrictions on me and forcing me to basically feel indebted to them in some way. They didn't let me own a car until I was basically working and could afford my own during which my mom shoved her 5 year old used car on me and forced me to pay her installments on the rest of the loan, while she got herself a brand new one. Needless to say, that fucked up most of my adult life. When I was with peers, such as coworkers and they wanted to do something I didn't, I would basically just leave the group to do my own thing because I was fed up with being forced to comply with others, but it was something that ultimately isolated me from developing friendships or meaningful connections because I was seen as a lone wolf.

I'd say it's just as bad now even as a grown adult. My APs try to deprive me of any little joys I had before. I bought coffee beans to make my own coffee at home but my mom hides it because she says I drink too much caffeine and it's bad for my bones. I had some protein powder and creatine for the gym which I didn't even take that often but my dad said some idiotic shit about them being bad for the kidneys and causing dialysis so they threw the whole thing out, which costed me $50. Then they complain that I'm not losing weight from going to the gym. Gee, maybe it's because I don't fucking get enough protein because all I'm allowed to eat is vegetables so I can't build muscle mass... When we go out to eat with family, my mom constantly tells me to eat less while she piles food onto my dad's plate. Then she expects me to act like nothing is wrong in front of family members so we can pretend to be a normal family. My APs also keep track of my bank statement and spendings so that they can berate me on unnecessary purchases. My mom constantly plays Tiktoks about the importance of frugal living and saving money and it's just some depressing shit about how these people don't buy anything and save their entire lives to devote that money towards raising their children and wife who is probably just some arranged marriage and just as controlling as their AMs who instilled that belief into their heads. I honestly don't fucking agree with that, I'd rather not have kids than have to live that way for the rest of my life.

My AM constantly calls me ungrateful for not knowing how much they gave me and that I should be listening to everything they tell me because it's only good advice for me. I on the other hand can't stop cursing her under my breath. I can't wait to not have to see them again. If you're in a similar boat as me, I feel very sorry we have to go through this asian mindset of ""parents are always right"" and we should unconditionally listen to them. It's a load a bullshit for these people who failed in their own lives and are now trying to get a second try at life through their kids.",2,1745783976.0,AsianParentStories,1,1.0,False

I can accept e-transfer and cash. I can ship to your address at your own cost or we can meet in person at Airsoft Depot during store hours.

I have been buying and selling on this subreddit since 2019 so I'm fairly trustworthy while ensuring prompt shipping of my items.

Those are my pricings or best offer. Please and thanks.

**I have price dropped some of my items. Please take a look! I can offer free shipping for certain items. Please don't hesitate to DM me about it.**

# >>--- Airsoft Guns ---<<

**$700** **- VFC BCM Jack Carbine 16"" Custom AEG + extras -** [https://imgur.com/a/D2KSYFK](https://imgur.com/a/D2KSYFK)

* **Built by Dave at Airsoft Depot**
* ACM EO 552 and B5 crane stock included, what you see is what you get
* 16"" barrel with Prometheus 6.03mm inner barrel pre-installed
* 4uad bucking pre-installed
* Custom Disruptive Grey cerakote finish
* Deep engrave BCM receiver markings
* True 1:1 clone of BCM Jack Carbine, **one of a kind custom build**
* This is an AEG, eletric rifle with metal gearbox

**$325** **- PTS Masada ACR SV DE AEG -** [https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS](https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS)

* Various upgrades have been done to it. Purchased back in 2015.
* Spring has been downgraded to M100 spring, and clocked at 346 FPS back when indoor requirements were capped at 360 FPS.
* Wii-Tech steel inner barrel, and Modify Flat Hop bucking are installed
* ~~Wii-Tech Hop up Adjustor Kit and~~ Bearing Spring Guide is not installed but included in the package
* 2x midcap PMAGs included (One full markings and one no markings)
* Clone VSG grip and WML light in DE (battery not included), and MBUS Pro metal sights in BK included
* One pack of Element MOE polymer rails in DE for the above picatinny accessories
* Original A2 birdcage flash hider included, just not pictured
* Simple AR carbine soft gun bag included, original box not included

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip. Most or majority of parts can still be purchased directly from PTS at a low cost: [https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg](https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg)

**$350** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -** [https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6)

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

I absolutely adore him. He’s thoughtful, giving, and easily the most selfless person I’ve ever met.

He doesn’t seem to really care for gifts or favors. I always offer to bring him tea/coffee, food, etc, and he seldom accepts. He doesn’t seem very excited by gifts. I compliment him all the time and tell him how much I love him regularly. He humbly accepts but doesn’t seem to care if I do or don’t. In short, he seems to get a lot from giving, not necessarily receiving.

Any advice or ideas on what I can do to make him feel loved and seen, perhaps in less conventional ways that I’m already doing? I’m striving to be the best wife that I can be and take to heart good marital advice I receive. What works for you??

However, at the beginning of April, Option-O paused all shipments to the US due to tariffs. In a news update, they stated that they will try to come up with a workaround, but may end up just offering refunds.

Seeing as I’m not willing to pay $1250 for a grinder that was originally $500, I may be looking at cancelling if the tariff situation isn’t resolved. In that case, it would be nice to find an alternative grinder at a similar price point. Does anyone have any recommendations?

What I liked about the Casa: 
Ability to grind all roast levels for espresso, very low retention for a single dose grinder, reputable company, relatively fluffy grind so WDT isn’t strictly necessary

I’m not sure I care at this point if I get a single dose or hopper grinder, but if it’s single dose, I’d like it to be very low retention. If it’s a hopper grinder I would like some way of ensuring I get the same amount of ground coffee every time without much faff with a scale (grind by weight would be nice, grind timer probably more realistic in this price range)

I definitely don’t want a DF-54 or anything in that line up, id like something from a more reputable company, similar to Eureka and Option-O.

Waking up on a crisp morning, getting to work, and then enjoying a nice, hot, barista-made coffee is something I have always enjoyed since and on bad days, it was a motivator to get out of bed!

I thought I’d never be compatible with someone who didn’t like coffee but I was wrong! I met the most incredible person who calls coffee “juice from devil’s arse” but tags along with me anyway and drinks hot chocolate.

Fast forward to now, my work relocated office from CBD to another end of the city where there’s NOTHING. The nearest bus stop is 2 km or 30 min walk away. The nearest cafe is a 10 min drive away. I don’t have a car. I take the public transport to get to work. There’s not a cafe I can go to during my commute. 

On weekends, my partner and I enjoy a bit of a sleep-in. By sleep-in, I mean we still get out of bed by 8. I want to get coffee first but he always insists on taking our dog for a walk first. I cave in. Again, where we live, there are no cafes. We have to walk for 40 mins to get to the nearest cafe. I have no standards at this point and just want some coffee in a takeaway cup that I can hold on to and savour every sip. But no, he says we can go for coffee after gym. I cave in again and agree. Drop the dog at home, head for the gym. It’s around 11 am by the time we are done at the gym. Go back home and shower. Get dressed. It’s noon now.

I don’t feel like coffee anymore. 

When I lived in the city by myself, I got a coffee every morning, whether I was working or not. Just grab a coffee, walk by the waterfront or inner city, and it used to be a great start to my day. And now, we bought a house in a suburb where the shops are close by but no cafes, which is strange. My work is in a secluded area where there is nothing around.

I’m not really in a position to buy my own coffee machine. I have always enjoyed buying it and having a great start to my day. I just miss it SO SO MUCH.

Sorry for the rant.

Not only that, but I am taking a break from full time teaching after 9 years. I decided to pick up more cases for my part time work I do working with 4 year olds doing early intervention services. Each student is 2 hours a week. Right now I see 2 students a week, so starting in September, I will have more cases. I will also be helping out my mom with her home care business, doing some administrative stuff for her. 

I am so so excited and happy that I finally made this decision. I’ll still be teaching, but it will be traveling around to students homes and daycares/preschools. One hour at a time, and then I leave. I can go to coffee shops during the day. I can walk my dogs during the day, do laundry, make healthy meals, all the things I don’t have time and energy for when I am full time teaching. 

What sealed the deal for me was I was starting to get really painful stomach cramps/pains whenever I was at work due to stress. As soon as I made this decision and told my principal, the pains have completely gone away, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

I will finish out the school year, have fun with my students, and step into the next chapter. I hope anyone else that is leaving the full time teaching world feels the same peace and joy as I do right now! ",11,1745783231.0,TeachersInTransition,2,1.0,False

I apologize in advance if this isn't the right place to post this. 

I'm looking for a female friend with whom I can find friendship, understanding, and support while going through divorce. The heartbreak is immense, the pain comes and goes, and I know there are others like me who are suffering the lack of support groups in our great city.

Not online please. There are many online groups that I did not exactly benefit from. It isn't for everyone. I'd like to meet-up and chat, have coffee, take a walk at the park or beach. We can even sit in the car and cry our hearts out. I only ask that you're compassionate and understanding. I promise to be the same to you. 

I'm in therapy, which is very helpful, but it's costly for a 50 minute session and my therapist won't be my friend that I can talk to whenever I need to. 

I work but we can meet after office hours or on the weekend.   

Feel free to DM me.

1k9cmgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k9cmgd/should_you_trust_the_waterdrop_wda1_countertop_ro/,Should You Trust the Waterdrop WD-A1 Countertop RO System Review for Your Home?,"Testing the Waterdrop WD-A1 Countertop Reverse Osmosis System over the past few weeks has been an experience worth sharing. The model immediately strikes you as a sleek and modern appliance that almost feels like it belongs in a futuristic kitchen. It’s not just about looks, though; this countertop system is loaded with features and functionality that had me testing its limits on a daily basis.

**Impressive Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed the product, I noticed its compact and modern design. Its dimensions—18.3 inches deep, 7.8 inches wide, and 17.1 inches tall—allow it to fit snugly on most countertops without hogging too much space. Weighing 38.5 pounds, it feels solid and durable. The blue exterior finish pairs well with contemporary decor styles, and the overall design feels clean and intuitive. The top access location for maintenance is surprisingly functional, and the construction material, combining reverse osmosis membrane, carbon block, and PP cotton, reassures you of long-term durability.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek countertop installation with no drilling required.  
- Six temperature settings (41°F–203°F) to adjust water for drinking, tea, coffee, or other beverages.  
- Quiet operation with modes such as night and off-home mode for energy savings.  
- A compact, visually appealing design that works seamlessly in kitchens or offices.

**Advanced Filtration Performance**  
What impressed me the most was its six-stage reverse osmosis filtration process. The system effectively tackles TDS (95.34% reduction), fluoride (99.53%), lead (99.69%), arsenic, and even eliminates PFAS, PFOA, and PFOS. The water quality noticeably improved after using this, with a pristine taste I couldn't help but appreciate daily. Factor in the bottleless design, and this appliance reduces reliance on plastic bottles significantly, making it an eco-conscious choice. The LED indicators, especially for filter life, add another layer of convenience.

[Check Waterdrop WD-A1 Countertop Reverse Osmosis System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c4n497mv/)

**Temperature Customization and User Experience**  
Having 6 temperature presets ranging from 41°F to 203°F was incredibly convenient. Hot water for tea brewed evenly, while cold water at 41°F made a refreshing drink without the need for ice. Five preset cup volumes felt intuitive after the first use, and the LED smart touch keys provided quick control over all settings. Using this dispenser felt effortless, and its night mode proved helpful for quiet evenings when I didn’t want to disturb my family.

However, adjusting to the interface took some trial and error initially. Although straightforward, the touch panel can sometimes be too sensitive, registering unintended inputs.

**Upsides**  
- Robust filtration removes even radioactive substances and heavy metals.  
- Ultra-clear taste that rivals top bottled water brands.  
- No hidden setup costs—it’s ready out of the box.

**Deficiencies**  
- The initial filter replacement costs may feel steep.  
- Occasionally sensitive touch keys on the smart panel.  
- Bulkier in weight compared to alternatives.  

**Energy Efficiency and Extra Settings**  
The appliance earns extra points for including a night mode and off-home mode that cater to energy-conscious users like myself. With 800 watts of power, it heats water quickly while ensuring minimal energy wastage. There’s also an altitude mode—a feature I’ve seen rarely on competing systems—which adjusts settings for areas with high elevations. I found its energy-saving modes especially useful, as I’m always looking to cut down on unnecessary electricity consumption.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this reverse osmosis system to competitors like the AquaTru Countertop RO and the Brio 5-Stage Dispenser, certain strengths and weaknesses become apparent. AquaTru’s model offers a similar level of filtration but doesn’t provide the wide temperature range that the WD-A1 boasts. On the other hand, Brio’s dispenser leans toward simplicity but lacks the night mode and altitude-friendly settings found here. This makes the WD-A1 a standout choice for those looking for high customization paired with smooth functionality.

**Price Performance**  
Given its robust feature set, intuitive technology, and genuine enhancements to water quality, this system hits a satisfying balance of performance and affordability. It may not feel budget-friendly at first glance, but there’s long-term value in reduced plastic waste and unmatched filtration efficiency. For buyers committed to clean water, spending slightly more upfront pays off in quality and convenience, placing this system above competitors in terms of cost-effectiveness.

1k9cmfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k9cmfi/i_just_went_through_a_textbook_avoidant_discard/,"I just went through a textbook avoidant discard with my unaware DA partner...who's a therapist. I'm pretty devastated and torn if I should follow up on sending him avoidant attachment resources...that he said he'd be open to reading, but I don't trust he won't react defensively, even given his job.","Throwaway account for privacy reasons and feeling like I need to share this specificity of my breakup...because it's pretty wild. Even so, I'm going to try my absolute best to keep the other details as vague as I possibly can. 

The short of it is that I  began dating my partner feeling refreshed and with the assumption he would be different and self-aware, being a therapist and all. And at first, our relationship did feel much healthier than my past relationships. My partner was also in his own therapy, which I really appreciated. We spent tons of time together on a regular basis, he was so affectionate and we had great, deep, intellectual talks for hours on end. Our relationship steadily progressed and we spent the holidays together and with our families. Just 3 months ago, he told me he loved me for the first time. I was elated and began to imagine a future with him.

I had anxiety throughout the relationship that I was working on in my own therapy. I'd notice little telltales my partner was DA, but tried not to read into them too deeply, like he would get openly impatient with me over little things, he almost never opened up emotionally without me heavily prompting it, he had a lack of serious relationship history (which he chalked up due to having a previous job throughout his twenties that had him constantly travel), and when we got into our sole fight in the relationship, he disproportionately blamed me for it and stonewalled me nearly the entire day after, and he was randomly quite selfish out of nowhere. Still, I figured this was just ""avoidant traits"" and could be worked through, not full-blown DA. Also, being that he was a therapist, I never really addressed it with him...a sort of unspoken ""don't school the teacher"" rule seemed to exist in this relationship.

I was admittedly not in a great place overall throughout our time together. I was working a terrible toxic job and just not taking great care of myself, just basic self care and a few walks every now and again for exercise. I barely had time or energy for anything else. There were some big logistical strings keeping me tied to the job for about 6 more months, mainly a certification I was in the process of getting. My partner was not sympathetic about any of it and frequently gave me a ""buck up, camper"" or ""you're overthinking this, just quit"" kind of attitude when I tried to express my frustration and exhaustion. All I really had energy for was the exhausting job and my boyfriend and my pets. It happens. I tried to give myself grace while I rode it out and got my certification. Our relationship was doing fine overall.

Then my boyfriend experienced two fairly traumatic events within the span of a few weeks. He refused to acknowledge the full impact of either one when I tried to ask him if he was okay, though I could tell he was upset. He began to pull away from me and become the most selfish I'd ever seen him, like just driving us whatever restaurant he wanted to go with no input from me or watching his shows that were several episodes in, again, without asking me what we should watch together.

I waited a bit to see if maybe it would improve but when it was becoming more of a pattern, I was working up to address it when...my boyfriend basically came over one afternoon and requested a break. His rationale? He didn't like how I handled my toxic job/burnout, was frustrated at my ""victim mentality"" and how I wasn't taking care of myself, and asserted we're just too different, and we both need to work on ourselves alone. I tried to tell him that I actually completely understood his concerns and was working to improve them, but was confused why he never told me he felt this way, and that he let the resentment build to this point. I was fairly adamant we could salvage things while staying together but he was determined to take the break instead. He said we could take space for two weeks then talk then.

Yesterday, though, a week early, he dumped me via text (yeah). He told me his feelings weren't changing and while our time together was amazing, he still felt we need to work on ourselves separately. I was devastated and insisted he call me. We proceeded to have an extremely emotional call in which we were both crying. He told me he still loves me but just cannot be in a relationship right now and continued to insist my ""rut"" and his ""rut"" was just genuine incompatibility. On this call, I discussed his avoidant traits and asked if he would open to read up on avoidant attachment (he doesn't use it in his work). I told him, ""I think it could be really helpful for you in your work too."" He agreed to read up on it but generally seemed to have no awareness that this entire situation was a textbook avoidant discard. It blew my mind.

Now I sit here on a Sunday morning in which he'd usually be in my bed and I'd make him coffee...but he's gone. I want to send him the articles but feel like he may not even read them at this point, or just react defensively, but part of me wonders since he's a therapist if there's some hope he may read them and at the very least, never again do to anyone what he did to me. 

This is so hard. I have no idea what to do.

**TL;DR:**  
Dated a therapist who seemed self-aware and loving at first. Over time, subtle avoidant traits showed up, but I brushed them off. I was dealing with burnout from a toxic job, and he showed little empathy. After two personal traumas, he became distant and selfish, then asked for a break and dumped me by text a week later. On a tearful call, he said he still loved me but blamed incompatibility. I pointed out his avoidant patterns, which he agreed to look into, but he seemed unaware of how textbook it all was. Now I'm heartbroken, wondering if I should even bother sending him the resources. I sometimes feel like because he's a therapist that maybe things could be salvaged.",1,1745783096.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

4 random facts about me:

1. I’m the kind of person who believes pineapple does belong on pizza. Because life’s better when you mix sweet with a little unexpected.🍕

2. I ride a motorcycle because sidewalks are for people with no sense of adventure.🏍🔥

3. Fun isn’t something I plan, it just kind of happens when I’m around. Late-night laughs, spontaneous plans, and moments you’ll remember way too clearly.

4. Coffee is not a lifestyle, it's my bloodtype.☕️❤️

5. And when there’s energy left over, you’ll find me at the gym lifting, pushing limits, or just clearing my head.

(Four facts? Five? Who’s counting when the vibe’s this good.)😏😌

As for the pineapple debate:
It’s sweet, a little controversial, and completely underrated. Kind of like me, honestly. Plus, if fruit on pizza makes it a salad, I’m basically a wellness icon.🤣👀

Final thought:
If you’re into motorcycles, good banter, strong coffee, and someone who’s just the right mix of calm and chaos, we might be onto something.

He is a musician and always had a passion for music. That never bothered me.
What did bother me is when that pursuit led him right into Izzy (24NB). An up and coming singer songwriter with a straight shot to record deal. 
My husband auditioned to be her back up guitarist a year and a half into our relationship. I was a bit worried. Mark is bi and Izzy was a beautiful and talented musician- (something I’ve never been very skilled in, though I did try to learn)
At first, it seemed fine. Izzy would come over a few times a week for rehearsal and were always wonderful. Except they did this thing.. when we met, they went on and on about how beautiful I was, and how it was ‘love at first sight’ (Something they notably never did with anyone else that I saw)
I brushed them off as part of their rather quirky personality. But they kept happening. Jokes about swooping in and ‘stealing me away’, every greeting peppered with ‘I’m in love with you’ and things of that nature. 
It got worse when I started dabbling in my old love for costuming and cosplay. 
I’m FTM, and use my biologically given features to portray characters. In my mind it’s similar to drag- just.. without blowing money on the silicone. 
This is when it led into overly touchy cuddling. At one point, in an attempt to ward off advances from a guy, they openly made out with me. 
Four things about this in particular 
1. They ended up getting together with this guy anyway. They have made a routine of entertaining sleazy or bad intentioned people in the past and never stay fixated on one for long.
2. Izzy has had a pointed issue with lying to get their way in the past 
3. It was so bad I genuinely considered whether I was attracted to fem born people at all
4. Mark was in full support of their plan and my involvement (had direct line of sight from the stage) 

Izzy also ended up on our honeymoon. Right before the wedding, I was involved in a near deadly crash and my car was totaled in the process. I ended up getting scammed with the car I bought to replace it. It overheated and stranded us three hours from home. 
Izzy drove up to ensure we had transportation. Which I am forever grateful for. That’s a lot to ask of a friend. But their behavior worsened over the course of the trip. 
They asked and insinuated that we’d skinny dip in the hot tub, made thinly veiled jokes about how it looked like we “invited them up for a threesome”
It all came to a head when I spent three hours packing the car while they sat alone together in the hot tub. 
I didn’t forgive them for that for a long while.
I don’t say this lightly but I feel like their presence ruined the honeymoon experience entirely. 
From that point on- things got weirder. They kept inviting Mark out, claiming they only had “one spare ticket” but this was to movies, performances, concerts. To a point where I started joking that they were dates.
Well.. after an eye-opening conversation with my friends, it stopped being a joke. 
I sat down and discussed my discomfort with Mark. Which he responded to with more anger than I’ve ever seen from him. Offense, disgust, betrayal. A whole list of overacted emotions in response to needing reassurance. 
That, to say the least, did nothing to comfort me. Especially when I’m sure I saw Izzy’s car peeling out of our complex after I forgot to mention to mark that I was going to be back earlier than I originally told him. 
There are other incidents and such, but these are all the big ones that stuck with me.

Now for the present. I’m six months post divorce. Which came as a random sit down conversation at 2 am- where he told me he wasn’t in love with me, hadn’t been since the crash, that he lied during his vows. He was leaving to vagabond in another country to pursue music and I had a month to pack up our life together.
And who may you ask did he decide to take this life change up with?? You guessed it- Izzy. 

But! Despite all of this, I was expected to believe that I was ‘a perfect partner and did absolutely nothing wrong’?

I’m happy in my progress in processing the sudden uprooting. I do feel that I was festering in that relationship and I’ve broadened my interests.
But Izzy has reached out, mentioning a drunken joke I made about taking them for coffee during the joint birthday party they insisted on throwing me (post-divorce. Awkward as HELL) 
Drunken me is NOT a reflection of sober me’s interests. 
I feel bad that I’ve made this promise, but in my eyes it feels like throwing away my pride and self-interest to go on this date.

I (19M) have had this badge since primary school. I learn things fast, I can grasp complex concepts instantly, I can quickly process information. And I though the same applies to my feelings, that I know what I feel, but I was wrong...

A week and a half ago, when I was doing my ongoing project for uni, I spotted a message on my phone. 

""I like you. Would you like to meet for coffee?""

I read it fast and returned to my project. Only after a while I realized someone just asked me out, first time in my life. It was a girl from my class, but different group, so the only conversation we had had before was few months ago when I helped her with some topic per her request. I didn't know her much, so I agrred to the meeting to get to know her better.

Few days later we finally met. She was wearing a gorgeous black dress. Our conversation was going smoothly. She told me some anecdotes from her life, what she likes, and how much she likes me. The last one struck me,and I don't know what I was thinking, but I agreed to date her. I got back home with a smile on my face - I've got a girlfriend! But I there was also something weird about this feeling...

Next day I met her in Uni, with a beautiful smile on her face. She told me how much happy she is. How much it matters to her. But as I was looking at her, I was feeling... weird. I though that those doubts will disappear eventually, especially that her and my friends started cheering us. So I brushed them off.

Next day, they didn't disappear. And I couldn't even identify what is wrong...
And even more friends joined our ""fanclub"". I looked at her face constantly, but as she was blushing in response, I tried to find this feeling of attraction. It was there, but at the same time not.

Friday came, 3 days after we started dating. She opened up to me and shared her difficult past, and how happy she is now thanks to me. But when she talked about it all I could think about was:

""Forgive me... Forgive me... Forgive me...""

The moment of realization came when she asked me for a kiss on her lips. I turned into stone so she said it's apparently too early. On my way back home I was thinking hard about what just happened. But I couldn't imagine kissing her. It's not like it disgusted me. I just didn't feel the need for it, at all. I realized that she is indeed attractive...
...but not for me.

And now I'm scared. I'm an adult and I should know how I feel. But apparently I don't. I hate myself for it, that I gave this girl I chance, and now, when she said how happy she is because of me I have to end our relationship. Not even a full week. I should've done this sooner, or even better, that day instead of ""yes"" I should reply with ""maybe"". I hurt someone really amazing, a person that deserves all the happiness in the world but... I can't give it. It is my fault and I'm ready for consequences, from her and from our friends.

I would love to see if anyone else has had this experience.

My mom lives on the first floor of a condo. She swears that she heard the upstairs occupants say “what is that noise? Oh it’s just her coffee maker” when she used the machine one morning. She then bought several different coffee makers to find a quieter one and, prior to using it, would make sure the furnace would turn on to mask the noise. One time, she was using a spin mop and says that she heard the same upstairs neighbors say “what is that? Oh that’s just her spin mop”. She stopped using the mop. The final weird story was that she says she heard young children outside her home yelling at 5:30am one weekend morning.

The condos are newly built, her windows are always shut. I’ve been over often and can never hear a thing. There are no young children in her neighborhood. When I bring this up, my mom just says she has excellent hearing.

Last thing, slightly unrelated. She lives in a small town. She attends morning church services. For a less than one mile drive, she leaves 30 minutes early because she doesn’t want to get stuck in school traffic. She’s always 20-25 minutes early.

Wondering if anyone else has seen this type of issue in their aging parents (i.e., is this part of the aging process or instead potential medicine side effects).

If you can relate, let’s chat about something I’ve found super helpful: **Energy Chunking**! ⚡️

Imagine not being a slave to the clock but instead, listening to your body and brain. Sounds kind of radical, right? But stick with me because it just might change your whole game.

### So, what the heck is Energy Chunking? 

Instead of blocking out rigid time slots, you focus on **energy levels** throughout the day. Think of it as working *with* your natural rhythms rather than against them. Here’s how it works:

- **Listen to Your Body**: Are you a morning person? Maybe you save the heavy tasks for first thing. Night owl? Tackle them after dinner.
  
- **Define Energy Levels**: Rate your energy throughout the day. Is there a time when you're feeling unstoppable? 👊 Those are your *power hours*. Schedule your most important tasks then!
  
- **Break It Down**: Instead of long stretches, break your work into smaller “chunks” based on your energy. It’s all about the rhythm, baby!

- **Mix It Up**: If you're feeling drained, switch gears! Time to take a dance break or check in on your favorite YouTube channel? Do it! Recharge with something that lifts your spirits.

### Real Talk: Why does this matter? 

When you’re working in sync with your own energy, productivity practically sparks on its own! 💥 Plus, it feels a lot less stressful. You’re not fighting against the clock; you’re riding the waves of your own productive tide. 

Remember, just last week, I had one of those “nothing is working” days. I ditched my rigid plan, noticed I was way more alert after my coffee — so I jumped into writing that killer report instead of checking emails. You wouldn’t believe how quickly I finished it! 

**Some extra nuggets to ponder:**
- What if you let go of strict schedules entirely and just focused on your energy?
- How much more could you get done if you allowed yourself breaks based on your mood? 
- What’s your favorite way to recharge? 

Everyone has different rhythms and methods that work for them, and that's okay! Embrace what feels right. After all, productivity isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation. 

Energy Chunking is about finding that sweet spot where you can actually enjoy your work and still get results. So, anyone else tried this? What’s your secret sauce for staying focused and energized? Let’s keep the convo going! 🚀",1,1745782251.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

>The Canadian photographer is currently self-publishing a photography coffee table book entitled “Everyday Africa“, detailing a five month overland journey from Cairo to Cape Town. “Three of the five months were spent with an overland truck tour company. Starting in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, I followed the Nile down to the Sudan, then across to Ethiopia. From there I ventured into Kenya, then Uganda and Rwanda, and back into Kenya. I continued into Tanzania, with a stop in Zanzibar, then over to Malawi and Zimbabwe, before flying to Namibia for a self-drive tour. My journey would then end in the South African coastal city of Cape Town. My travel photography book project, Everyday Africa, documents this journey through beautiful photographs of the ever changing landscapes, glorious wildlife, and diverse peoples and cultures. Traveling overland from country-to-country provides an opportunity to truly see the subtle and dramatic shifts in the demographics of each nation. There were many long driving days, and with an open-air overland vehicle, I made the most of my time to capture the authentic comings-and-goings of urban and rural life, from the villages of sub-Saharan Africa to the towns of Swahili-speaking East Africa.”

I ace the interview and go out to my car, I stand there and say ""I'm going now. Bye"". I had a final look at the road. A blue car passes, followed by yours. I hide behind the window panel was you pass. But then eventually come at the front. I looked at you as you slowly drove away. I like to believe that you saw me.

1k9bvqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1k9bvqr/does_the_acko_folding_step_stool_really_deliver/,Does the ACKO Folding Step Stool really deliver durability and safety? Review here!,"The ACKO A0534 Folding Step Stool quickly became a staple in my daily life. Designed with practicality and durability in mind, this collapsible step stool excels at helping users reach those tricky high shelves or providing a reliable boost when needed. Having tested it extensively in my home, kitchen, and even outdoors, I feel I’ve put it through its paces enough to share my honest opinion.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out about the ACKO A0534 Folding Step Stool is its solid build. Measuring 13 inches in height, it's crafted from heavy-duty plastic and feels remarkably sturdy despite its lightweight design. I was pleasantly surprised at how effortlessly it folds flat, an advantage in my compact kitchen where storage space is at a premium. The ergonomically designed carrying handle pops up naturally when the stool is folded, making it convenient to move around. The rubber grips on the surface and anti-slip feet ensure safety, even on tile or wood flooring. Occasionally, I’ve used it outdoors during a family barbecue, and it held firm despite a slightly uneven patio surface.

**Safety Features**  
Every parent knows the panic that comes with kids climbing onto anything higher than three inches off the ground. This stool, however, puts me at ease. ACKO incorporated rounded corners and a safety stop-gap feature into the design to maximize stability. My niece, who’s four, often carries it around to wash her hands in the bathroom, and I appreciate the thoughtful details such as the grip-dot textured surface that prevent slips. It’s clear the manufacturer took safety seriously.

**Advantages**  
- Sturdy and can support up to 300 pounds.  
- Compact and folds flat for easy storage in closets, kitchens, or RVs.  
- Lightweight yet incredibly durable, making it great to transport.  
- Equipped with non-slip grips for added safety on various surfaces.

[Check ACKO A0534 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b01lyw5bfb/)

**Ease of Use**  
If you’ve ever fumbled with stubborn folding furniture, you’ll love how seamless this step stool’s mechanism is. A quick pull of the handle, and it unfolds or folds without frustration. My coworker borrowed it to fix a high shelf in our office break room, and even with minimal instruction, she managed it just fine. Maintenance is a breeze too. A quick spot clean has kept it looking as good as new, even after facing muddy shoes and spilled coffee.

**Drawbacks to Consider**  
- The black color, while sleek, tends to show dust and dirt easily.  
- At times, the stool feels marginally less stable if not placed on a flat surface.  
- The 13-inch height might be limiting if you need to reach higher spaces often.

**Target Audience**  
Whether you’re a parent looking for a stool your kids can safely use, a homeowner needing a boost for reaching high cabinets, or someone who often camps or travels, this folding step stool fits seamlessly into various settings. Its multi-purpose usability stretches across bathrooms, kitchens, offices, and gardens. For someone like me, it’s been versatile enough to use everywhere—and then some.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this stool to competitors like the Cosco Folding Step Stool and Rubbermaid Step Stool, I noticed a few key differences. While the ACKO model trumps its rivals in portability and weight limit (300 pounds vs. 200 pounds on others), the Cosco alternative features a taller model for slightly better reach. However, the ACKO feels more robust during use, with a safety-oriented design that inspired greater confidence when my younger relatives handled it. Rubbermaid’s product also has a nice grip but lacks the flat folding capability that makes the ACKO so storage-friendly. For budget-conscious buyers or those who value convenience, this stool holds its own against the alternatives.

**Price Performance**  
Given the robust features and sturdy build, this stool feels like excellent value for its price range. It’s often said that quality is worth investing in, and I think this product falls under that category. While cheaper alternatives exist, it’s the combination of durability, safety, and ease of use that justifies spending a little extra on this item. Plus, I don't have to worry about frequent replacements due to wear and tear.

I know the hatred the show gets especially for the later seasons.  I'm not here to talk about, defend or argue with those takes. 

I want to tell a story.  A story of my father and myself.  And how we bonded over Game of Thrones and how he help on to finish the series. 

Years and years ago when Season 2 hit the air.  I got a call from my father.  He told me I needed to watch this show called Game of Thrones.  He said I'd like it as it's a more adult version of Lord of the Rings.  I gave it a go and after 3 episodes I was hooked. I at the time though, ended up losing my job and couldn't afford HBO. So I wasn't able to watch season 2.  Luckily my father asked me to come over every Sunday to watch it with him. 

It became our tradition.  Sunday nights at my parents.  He became obsessed.  He got the books on audio format and listened to them at work.  And he rewatched the show before every new season came out.  Collectables.  Every edition of the books.  Even got a signed photo of Lena Heady that he had framed. 

And then I got the call.  Mom was leaving dad.  It was because of the show. My mom is a bit of a religious prude and she accused my dad of watching the show only because of the nudity. 

I could see her point in a way because every Sunday, she'd walk in always during a scene with nudity.  It became funny because once someone took their clothes off... my mom would come walking in with pie or something else. 

I can still hear the ""so Bob... this is why you watch this show? Huh?  You sick old man""

He'd even go ""what about John?"" Pointing at me.  I was like ""this is awkward enough dad... don't bring me into this""

Anyways.  Mom gave him the option.  Her or the show.  He picked the show. They had a bad marriage anyways and I think she used Game of Throne nudity as an excuse.  He was happy.  He'd always have on Game of Thrones shirts.  He even did his living room up like a medieval place and his coffee table had a print of Westeros on it.  

So we continued watching the show and by the time season 6 ended, dad was diagnosed with brain cancer.  It was sad seeing a proud strong man, shrink to nothing.  I'd take him to his chemo appointments and he'd be bringing other westeros literature with him as he got treatment.  He'd always be talking to the nurses about Game of Thrones.  Full conversations about the politics and what he thought was going to happen. 

Over the next few years I could tell, he was holding out to see the end of the show. Season 7 came and went and by that time he figured he'd never see a new book.    So season 8 was it.  

We got to season 8 and by that time.  Dad knew he was going to die.  He was in stage 4 and he stopped treatment. I remember the first episode and how he demanded some red wine.  I told him he shouldn't drink but he said ""give me some damn wine Lancel"". He was calling me Lancel all the time and then saying ""what a stupid name"".  I don't know if he was joking or if his brain was mixing reality and game of thrones.   I'd get calls in the middle of the night from him. ""LANCEL!  WHAT A STUPID NAME!"". Then he'd hang up 


 By the time the 3rd episode hit, he was in hospice.  He had a Stark blanket that he slept with and a signed poster from some of the cast up in his room.  He was holding on to see that final episode. 

Then the last episode hit.  We watched it in his room together.  And when it was finally over....he looked at me and said ""I held the fuck on for this?!""

He died the next morning.    ",14,1745780378.0,freefolk,3,1.0,False

I’ve got an opportunity to buy a near brand new MacBook Air (15” 256gb 16gb ram) from a friend who has only ever used it for light use & is now wanting to sell it. He’s asking for £550.

I have been looking at MacBooks for the last few weeks so to be honest the fact he’s selling it whilst I’ve been looking at getting one anyway is near perfect timing. I’ve been doing a lot of comparisons between the M2/3/4 & I think the 2 would be perfect for what I need to use it for(Web browsing, discord, trading view, basic stuff etc) I’ve got a gaming rig with a 4070 in it for all of my heavy lifting, this will purely be for coffee shop sort of laptop sessions, nothing drastic at all

But is the M2 good from other people’s experiences? And is it still holding up years later? Does the chip perform well? Does it still support software updates to the latest OS etc? Did the m2 ever have any issues when it hit the shelves?

I’ve been using a 2017 MacBook Air with the intel core i5 processor in it so my guess is it’s will be seeing ample improvements from all angles as it is even with the M2

I’m just looking to hear peoples experiences and opinions to see if this is the right choice for the price point etc

A Truly Bad Idea [Latest Research Update],"Okay, so picture this: you’re the stroke consultant. You have a patient with recurrent ischaemic stroke. You’ve *already* covered them with clopidogrel. What more can you do 🤔? Your apixaban is collecting dust because the patient doesn’t have AF. 

So the PA asks “Hey, what if we gave this patient an anticoagulant anyway?”

How do we tell them that's a dumb ass idea, with *professional and academic finesse?* We are the consultant after all.

We might start by quoting the latest meta-analysis by ***Adamou et al. (2025)****,* published in the [**International Journal of Stoke**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17474930251337354)**.** 

This review aimed to assess if **adding an oral anticoagulant** to standard antiplatelet therapy could **further reduce the risk of stroke recurrence** in patients who otherwise don’t need it(no AF, DVT or PE history).

They had screened over 1,850 RCT’s and whittled it down to just **4 eligible studies**. The inclusion criteria was RCTs comparing oral anticoagulants + antiplatelet vs antiplatelet alone. From those 4 studies, **6,893 patients were included**. The outcomes studied were: Recurrence of ischaemic stroke, major haemorrhages and the net clinical benefits. 

**Key findings**:

* **Ischaemic stroke recurrence**: **No significant difference** between combination therapy and antiplatelet alone (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68–1.17).
* **Covert brain infarcts** (Detected on MRI):  **No significant difference**(OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86-1.31)
* **Major Haemorrhages**: **Significantly higher risk** with combination therapy compared to antiplatelet alone(OR 2.21 95% CI 1.25-3.90).
* **Net clinical benefit**: **There was none** (OR 1.12 95% CI 0.88-1.43)

The medical students are staring at you in awe of your scientific swagger. 

You conclude by saying, ‘*whilst it may look appealing to intensify treatment in the face of persistent recurrence, the study shows the importance of adhering to evidence-based practice.’* You lean back and sip your lukewarm coffee.

1k9bgxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1k9bgxz/reveal_the_ultimate_ruausine_rx002_carryon/,Reveal the ultimate Ruausine RX002 carry-on suitcase review for frequent travelers!,"The Ruausine RX002 Carry On Luggage recently became part of my travel routine, and I have definitely put it through its paces. As someone who frequently travels for work and short weekend getaways, I needed carry-on luggage that was compact yet reliable and stylish enough to bring to business meetings without sacrificing functionality. Here’s what I discovered while using this hard shell suitcase over the past few weeks.

**Durable and Lightweight Build**  
The first thing I noticed about this suitcase is its lightweight design combined with a hardside exterior made from high-quality material. Carrying it around felt like a breeze, even when it was packed to full capacity. Despite the lightweight construction, the exterior was impressively robust. Tossing it into overhead compartments and occasionally bumping it against turnstiles showed no noticeable wear or dents. Having young kids occasionally help me “test” its durability (more like dragging it around the house) confirmed its ability to withstand some extra roughness.

**Smooth Spinner Wheels**  
The spinner wheels might just be my favorite feature. I’ve used many suitcases in my day, and not all spinners are created equal. These wheels allow for 360-degree rotation, which is something I appreciated while maneuvering through crowded airports. Picture this—I’m running late for a flight, juggling coffee in one hand and my carry-on in the other, yet this suitcase glided by my side without a hitch. The omnidirectional movement felt smooth even on uneven surfaces, an asset for navigating cobblestones during a layover in Europe.

**[Check Ruausine RX002 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0dgx64sct/)**  

**Compact Size and TSA Approval**  
Measuring 22x14x9 inches, this carry-on luggage is ideal for airline approval. There was no hassle placing it in the overhead bin, and I didn’t have to stress over gate-checking situations. The TSA lock was yet another thoughtful feature. Passing through airport security was seamless, and knowing my belongings were secure with a lock that TSA could access for inspection was reassuring. This aspect is especially crucial when traveling with valuable items.

**Interior Compartments and Usability**  
The internal compartments are decently organized, with one side for straps to secure folded clothes and the other covered with a zippered mesh for toiletries or smaller items. While the organization worked for most items, I noticed one drawback—there’s no waterproof lining or separation within the interior. During a work trip, a bottle of shampoo leaked slightly, and because of the design, it was challenging to clean it up without affecting the clothes packed on the opposite side.

**Positives**  
- The hardshell material ensures durability and protection.  
- Approved size for most airlines, making boarding hassle-free.  
- Spinner wheels are smooth and provide excellent control.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Telescoping handle occasionally feels a bit sticky and takes extra effort to retract, which can get frustrating in hurried moments.  
- Lack of interior water-resistant lining could lead to minor spills soaking through to the other side.  

**Stylish Appearance and Versatility**  
This suitcase isn’t just functional; it’s also pleasing to look at. The sleek, minimalist design and clean white finish paired with subtle detailing make it feel more premium than the price suggests. However, I would advise keeping it away from grubby areas to maintain its pristine look—white doesn’t stay clean for long if you’re not careful. A coworker of mine even commented on how professional it looked as I wheeled into a conference.

**Competing Brands**  
Over the years, I’ve tried alternatives like Samsonite and American Tourister, both of which are industry favorites. While these higher-priced options often come with added features like scratch-resistant exteriors or double zippers for better durability, the Ruausine RX002 does a fantastic job at holding its own in terms of core functionality and affordability. Its lightweight design and smooth spinner wheels genuinely rival those of pricier brands, though it falls slightly short in terms of advanced materials like ABS-PC combinations, which might feel more premium.

**Bang for the Buck**  
It’s hard to deny the quality you’re getting at this price point. With its combination of durability, airline-approvable dimensions, and smooth rolling wheels, it feels like a smart investment for frequent flyers who want something stylish but functional. Sure, there are more expensive options with fancier features, yet not everyone is willing to shell out double the amount just for a marginal improvement in telescoping handle usability.

This visit has led to a conversation about never telling any mormon about me. They can know that I exist but not that I have any connection with them.

Wrapped in a silky Ecuadorian Connecticut leaf over Nicaraguan binder and long fillers, it offers the signature Oliva construction with a more gentle personality to most of the cigars from this brand. 

I lit one up on a sunny morning with a black coffee in hand, curious to see if this Robusto could hold its own among the crowded world of Connecticut cigars. Spoiler alert: it did.


Presentation & Cold Draw

The Oliva Connecticut Robusto is a good looking cigar; light golden wrapper, smooth with just a few fine veins and a faint oily sheen. The classic Oliva band pops against the wrapper’s creamy tone, giving it a clean and elegant look. Construction was textbook: firm pack, smooth seams, and a neatly applied cap.

On the cold draw, I got sweet hay, light cedar, buttery cream, and a faint vanilla tone. The draw itself was flawless, with just the right amount of resistance.

First Third – Creamy & Approachable

The first few puffs were creamy, nutty, and smooth as silk. Notes of buttered toast, almonds, and cedar took the lead, with a touch of white pepper on the retrohale to give it a bit of personality. It’s mellow, but not dull.

Smoke output was excellent for a Connecticut, and the texture was very soft. The burn line was clean and steady, and the ash held on with confidence - I wouldn't expect anything less from Oliva. 


Second Third – Subtle Yet Complex 

As I moved into the second third, the flavors gently evolved. The nuttiness deepened into cashew and caramel sweetness emerged, giving the profile a rounded, richer feel. The white pepper settled into the background and faint citrus zest flavour appeared. 

It stayed firmly in the mild-to-medium range, but offered enough shifts in flavor to keep things interesting. The burn line was close to perfect and ash hold on well.

Final Third – Smooth Fade to Finish

The final stretch brought back some of the initial cedar, along with light toast, leather and some of the initial creaminess. The sweetness tapered off, replaced by a slightly dry woodiness and a nutty finish. There was no harshness or bitterness.

Even near the nub, the draw stayed perfect and the cigar never heated up, ash hold on well and burn line remained sharp.

Final Thoughts

The Oliva Connecticut Robusto is a prime example of what a well-made Connecticut can be; creamy, flavorful, and far from boring. It’s approachable enough for beginners but nuanced enough for seasoned smokers who want a more relaxed experience without sacrificing quality.

With a smoke time around 45–60 minutes, it’s perfect for a morning session, a lunch break, or a quiet unwind in the afternoon. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It’s a reliable, classy, and beautifully made cigar that reminds you sometimes less is more—especially when it’s done right.",9,1745779991.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

My puppy has had a lot of socialization with other dogs, and stayed for several days with my in laws dogs and been totally fine. She is energetic and loves to play, but has never been aggressive. 
She knows her commands and will obey when you are firm. 
I’m feeling so much anxiety and guilt about the separation anxiety I’m sure she experienced when I left her with my friend and her dog. But none of her history made me think that she would exhibit any behaviors other than what my friend and I agreed would be totally okay and no problem. I took her comfort toys, and even cleaning supplies just in case she had an accident. 
My friend asked me to pick her up early when I asked how things were going because things “weren’t going great but we’re surviving” 
I asked what was happening and she ghosted me. After I paid her the full amount for the hours, she told me that she had been “extremely uncontrollable and mean to her puppy, had several accidents, and chewed her coffee table up” 
I was honestly shocked to hear these just because she has never acted mean or aggressive in any interaction or setting with other dogs and has had ample opportunity to show that side of herself, even times we have been in a new setting, with new people, or I have left. The accidents also surprised me because she may have one accident a week if I am slacking on staying rigid with her routine, but “several” accidents in 24 hours is concerning to me and doesn’t make sense. 
Chewing the coffee table I felt awful about, but my friend told me before that her puppy still chews up so many of her things so it was no worries and she was used to it. I also don’t understand how the coffee table got completely chewed up if she was there with her the whole time. She also doesn’t have that powerful of teeth and I don’t think work that quickly. 
I apologized and paid her, organized for a friend to pick her up while I hurry home from my trip, and said that I hoped she and her puppy are okay. This is not a close friend and I feel like I am in such a rough spot. 
My anxiety has been uncontrollable since I found out and today has been puppy blues, puppy mom guilt, and friend guilt out the wazoo. 
Any advice or encouragement would mean the world to me. ",7,1745779966.0,puppy101,8,0.89,False

1k9bcoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1k9bcoi/actions_vs_words/,Actions vs Words,"Twenty-two years together,
more than half of our lives,
and there's still a disconnect—
beyond the normal discomfort of sharing.

If anything, the gap has grown,
frustrations mounting on both sides.
I overthink everything and spin out,
while you wonder what the hell happened.

I move through life in romantic fantasy—
reading signs, conjuring fate,
convinced our souls were bound before we met.

You in worn work boots and asbestos,
loving me by fixing the plumbing and hanging a light.
I dive deep in search of meaning,
and you make sure we have a warm home.

We were different from the start.
I saw you and felt it—the connection.
Like an awakening—
“Finally, there he is.”

You?
You don’t recall much.
No cosmic shift—
just another Tuesday.

An orange sweater,
fitted just right—
your first recollection of me.
Just my boobs,
in my favorite color.

I had a life-altering experience.
And, well—
you were a teenage boy.

We kissed
and I left my body.
While you reel from the crazy girl
who just said she loved you.

Oye—the dichotomy.

How can two people
be on such extreme ends
and still end up
where we are?

I craft stories,
words stitched with bright threads,
spelling it over and over:
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.

It’s no wonder
it can feel one-sided.
At times, you’re silent.

Even when I force your words,
they fall short of what I’m seeking.
Not that your emotions are lesser—
if anything, I bet you feel more.

I push mine onto you,
and you carry them both—
my worries, my weight,
like my phone in your pocket on date night,
right next to your wallet,
and the fears you never say.

With me,
you must listen—
because I keep writing
what you’ll never read.

With you,
I must see.
Pay attention.
The details matter—
carrying my chair,
bringing me a drink,
a note, a snack,
a surprise left waiting—small but thoughtful.

You unload the dishwasher.
Make my coffee.
Brew my tea—just right,
no need to ask.

Your poetry is service—
making my day better.
You don’t say much—
but your acts speak volumes,
filling the air in our home
with structured love and care.

Actions win every time.
Their weight—more substantial.

You sometimes say you love me,
but you show me I’m your world.
You rarely say I’m yours or beautiful,
but your care and patience
with my eccentric ways
is unmatched.

You say you think about me,
when I’m starved for attention and lonely.
Just when I think you’ve forgotten—
a letter comes.

Five words
scrawled in red
on grid lines.
Folded.
Tucked.
Sealed.
Addressed.
Delivered.

Five gestures that outshine five words.
Action wins every time.

1k9b8rs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9b8rs,Events that led to the discovery of the deep corruption in Harris county leading back to the 70's (Post follow up),"Background: How Eric came to know Richard Wayne Collins and the following events that took place that caused his Growing Distrust of the System.



Eric first met Richard Wayne Collins in the early 2000s while helping him publish a novel during Collins’s imprisonment. Collins, then incarcerated, had developed a close friendship with Eric’s brother, offering him guidance and support at a critical time.



Eric’s brother had been sentenced to 30 years for a homicide committed at age 17 — a sentence Eric and his family believed was excessive given the impulsive circumstances of the act, involving a dangerous gang member and suspected sexual predator.

This early experience planted deep skepticism in Eric toward law enforcement, prosecutors, and the judicial system.



In 2015, Eric advocated for Collins’s parole by submitting letters of support to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, successfully helping to secure Collins’s release.

In 2018, Collins was falsely accused of a terroristic threat by a woman attempting to seize control of the home they rented together. The woman’s fabricated allegations collapsed when she refused to testify, and the case was dismissed. The allegations she made were very serious. She claimed that Collins threatened to kill her and dismember her and bury her in the backyard. This is in stark contrast and antithetical to Collins character as he wrote a thriller novel in dedication to victims of violent crime. 

Notably, while incarcerated, Collins had previously warned the FBI about murders he recalled witnessing as a child and had even Submitted psychological profiling theories during the Amber Hagerman abduction case, resulting in federal agents visiting him in prison in the 90s. Yet nothing had been done with the information he provided.



Separately, Eric’s brother later met Mark Anthony Lasher in 2022, another man who claimed wrongful conviction.

Eric’s independent investigation into Lasher’s case uncovered missing alibi evidence, repeated prosecutorial misconduct, and a trial largely based on hearsay and a pattern of false accusations by the alleged victim.



Through these cumulative experiences, Eric developed a strong belief that many prosecutors and law enforcement officials operate without sincere regard for guilt or innocence — a belief that would be confirmed repeatedly in the events that followed.



Main Timeline of Events:



1. Investigation of 2024 Arrest and Eric’s Early Warnings

In 2024, Richard Wayne Collins was falsely arrested for alleged sexual assault. Initially believing the case could be a mistaken identity, Eric soon realized otherwise after facing threats and intimidation from Harris County District Attorney staff while trying to submit exculpatory evidence.

The aggressive hostility made it clear that officials were knowingly pursuing a wrongful conviction.



Matters worsened Eric learned that the attorney assigned Jerry Guerinot, was widely regarded as the worst capital defense attorney in the United States — with 28 death penalty losses, 10 executions, and no successful sentence commutations attributed to his efforts, as documented by the New York Times. And Eric has a sworn affidavit of a witness who heard Jerry conspire with the prosecutor Kaylee veltri to force Collins to plea guilty as he could not escape from the parole hold. To this day absolutely no evidence has ever been presented, in particular the DNA lab report said to be accurate down to 8 octillianth. 



2. Discovery of 1978 Conviction Issues

While reviewing 2024 court documents, Eric noticed repeated references to Collins’s 1978 murder conviction, which resulted in a suspiciously short prison sentence.

Further investigation revealed fraudulent indictments, coerced pleas, missing transcripts, and systemic misconduct tied to the prosecution of Collins for the death of Muhammad Ali Vahdat (Bahdat)



3. Discovery of 1981 Aggravated Robbery Arrest and Sealed File

During his investigation, Eric discovered that Collins’s 1981 aggravated robbery arrest in Pasadena had been sealed — an unusual situation for a non-sensitive criminal case.

The district clerk confirmed that only Collins himself could unseal the file, which he eventually did by presenting his ID.

The sealing was highly suspicious, especially as Collins had never filed any motion to seal his own record.

The aggravated robbery conviction — obtained despite no physical evidence and a coerced co-defendant confession — initially triggered a life sentence under the third-strike rule.

Though later overturned on appeal, the case left clear resentment from Pasadena authorities, which likely contributed to future targeting.



4. Revelation of Childhood Trauma and Systemic Coverups

Separately, Collins disclosed that, as a young child, he had witnessed multiple murders committed by his stepfamily, with victims buried under their home.

However, Collins had forgotten or suppressed these memories until around age 30.

One morning, after hearing about the abduction of Amber Hagerman, he slept on it — and when he awoke The next day , a flood of memories returned.

He specifically remembered a little girl his stepfamily had abducted, raped, and murdered and dumped by rice university narrowly being caught by security. He remembers his step family member striking the little girl with a shovel so hard that blood flew all over the car door and on his face. He took the unconscious girl into the woods and said to another participant he had trouble digging a hole but she wouldn’t not get back up after what he did to her. 



This was in the early 60’s we have yet to locate info on this girl. But he remembers his step family reading the Houston chronicle and stating that “they found her” maybe a few years later, Collins is not sure how old he was but he could have been 3-5 years old. And the girl was 7-9 years old. They abducted her near a playground. She was Hispanic and believed nobody cared enough to publish news on her. 



Another particularly chilling  memory involved someone in the family, who was a police officer, bringing home a police investigative report, giving it to another man who placed  it in a Folgers coffee can in the sink, and burning it while laughing and saying:

“I guess you can get away with murder if you know anyone in HPD and you got a little money.”

Collins recalled that two to three hundred dollars — a significant sum at the time — was likely paid to destroy the critical paper report.

At that time, investigative paper reports were vital and irreplaceable once destroyed unless reconstructed immediately.



The officer had a vested personal interest in the cover-up.

This story eerily paralleled information Eric later heard from a man named McNatt, who described a similar situation involving Johnny Binder — a powerful, infamous drug dealer in the 70-80s who is famous for apparently “getting away with a jewelry heist” he had the conviction reversed after providing “evidence” of his alibi Eric reviewed this evidence and it was incredibly weak in short it appeared he paid People to take the fall for him and others to lie about his whereabouts. 



Even used receipts that were not even in his name it is very suspicious how the court of criminal appeals accepted this as evidence. And a confession of persons incarcerated in California with no proof they committed the heist? The Jewelry was never found and Johnny binder hired a very powerful and expensive lawyer and no explanation on how he paid him.



McNatt alleged that he believed Binder had raped and killed a young African-American girl, and although McNatt documented the crime scene himself, the official report later disappeared.

Only the chief of police could have deleted or destroyed the record at that time.

McNatt was furious and vocal about the cover-up, believing it caused internal tensions within the police force because some officers, like McNatt, opposed such corruption yet were powerless to stop it. 



Eric independently researched Johnny Binder, finding that Binder had faced serious charges  including human trafficking and sex crimes involving minors, yet managed to have all cases dismissed.

Binder’s immense wealth and influence raise serious concerns about systemic corruption within Houston law enforcement, consistent with Collins’s and McNatt’s accounts.



5. Meeting McNatt

Eric later met McNatt from pure coincidence, when he was at the hotel where collins was arrested looking for witnesses of the arrest and or photos and stumbled onto mcnatt visiting a friend, he further confirmed patterns of wrongful conviction and systematic misconduct. And asked for eric assistance in researching his case. After reviewing McNatt’s case, Eric identified over 30 significant trial errors, including the use of compromised witnesses incentivized to provide false testimony. In particular a convicted sexual offender who appears to have recieved an incredibly lenient sentence in return for his key testimony that ensured mcnatts conviction for the chief of major offenders “Samantha Knecht” 

The parallels between McNatt’s case and Collins’s were impossible to ignore.



6. Linking Unsolved Murders, Morales Funeral Home, and Matlock Perry’s Revelations

Further investigation tied unsolved murders back to John Henry Quinonez, Collins’s 1978 co-defendant and the actual killer.



Key insights came from Matlock Perry, a currently illegally detained man who grew up in the same neighborhood.

In a recorded prison call, Perry mentioned a suspicious funeral home—later identified as Morales Funeral Home.

Morales  had also been cited in secret recordings made by Collins in 1978 where the true killer “john henry quinones” stated morales’s name and an investigation. On the same weekend another man named Pedro Lugo was shot in the back of the head with a 30.30 rifle 

Eric uncovered that a .30-30 rifle had been borrowed from Morales funeral home, used in this  unsolved murder, then returned without anyone raising any questions on the matter and simply losing any interest or leads on the “killer”



Psychological evaluations of Quinonez revealed that he admitted to borrowing a .30-30 rifle sometimes from a friend, matching the timeline perfectly yet nobody has connected him to the crime. 



The murder occurred within 24 hours of Muhammad Ali Vahdat’s death, further implicating Quinonez and exposing police indifference to actual perpetrators.



7. Investigation into Danny Lynn Stevens’ Death

Collins later revealed information about the custodial death of Danny Lynn Stevens in Pasadena during the 1970s.

Despite initial difficulties locating records, Eric uncovered newspaper articles and secured the autopsy report, which cast significant doubt on the official ruling of suicide.

The autopsy was handled by Joseph Jachimczyk, a medical examiner with a troubling history of questionable rulings in politically sensitive deaths.



8. Current Status: Systemic Patterns of Misconduct

Eric’s investigations have exposed a pattern of systemic misconduct and corruption stretching across decades:

		



Fraudulent prosecutions of Richard Wayne Collins (1978, 2024),



The wrongful conviction of Michael McNatt,

Suppressed investigations of murders tied to John Henry Quinonez and Morales

,

The custodial death cover-up involving Danny Lynn Stevens,



A broader pattern of record destruction, witness intimidation, and corrupt preferential treatment for connected individuals like Johnny Binder.

Despite the overwhelming evidence compiled and submitted to authorities, no meaningful investigation or corrective action has been undertaken to this day.

Eric met Richard Wayne Collins in the early 2000s while helping him publish a novel from prison. After seeing his brother receive a harsh sentence and later witnessing Collins's wrongful accusations and imprisonment in 2018 and 2024, Eric’s distrust of the legal system grew. His investigations uncovered extensive corruption, including fraudulent charges against Collins, missing evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, and systemic coverups going back to Collins's 1978 wrongful conviction for murder.

Eric also discovered sealed records about a 1981 arrest, Collins’s suppressed childhood memories of multiple murders involving corrupt police officers, and connections between figures like Johnny Binder, John Henry Quinonez, and Morales . Eric’s research also exposed wrongful convictions (like McNatt's),  Danny Lynn Stevens’s death in police custody and broader patterns of police, prosecutorial, and judicial corruption stretching over decades in Texas. Despite presenting overwhelming evidence, authorities have refused to act or acknowledge these issues.

Will felt sweat trickle down his forehead. This was it. Everything Helen had told him turned out to be true. But it was more than that. From here on, any death would put him out of the race, and not only. In addition to everything else, he had to simultaneously extend his loop, but be on the lookout for enemies as well.

Quickly, the boy rushed into the school to claim his class. Entering the bathroom, he was just about to tap the mirror when he saw Alex casually sitting on the bathroom sink. The first thought that passed through Will’s mind was relief. Finally, he knew that the goofball was well. After the moment passed, fear slowly crept in. It was a bit convenient for him to show up only now that the contest phase had started.

“Hey, bro,” the thief said. There was a smile on his face, but it was nowhere as radiant as Will remembered it being. “Been a while.”

“Yeah.” Will’s glance shifted to the mirror. Had his friend snatched the class already?

“Oh, right. Sorry about that.” The goofball jumped off. “Go ahead. Just be more careful next time, okay? They’ll try to kill you before you get your class.”

Cautiously, Will reached out and tapped the mirror.

 

**You have discovered THE ROGUE (number 4).**

**Use additional mirrors to find out more. Good luck!**

**\[You can copy six classes in total.\]**

 

“Where have you been?” Will asked. “I called and texted, but—”

“Calls don’t work in mirror realms,” Alex said.

Will could feel himself tensed up. He could sense something was very wrong, even if he wasn’t sure why.

“You talk differently,” he said, ready to draw a weapon from his inventory.

“Right, right,” Alex laughed. “Must look sus as hell? No worries, bro. I’ll keep it up till after the alliance is over. For real.”

In the blink of an eye, Will reached into the bathroom mirror and grabbed his binding chain. He didn’t trust the person he was talking to, but didn’t want to kill him, either. Not if he could capture him.

The thief moved back, moving out of Will’s reach. That didn’t do any good. Thanks to his level boosting, Will had the ability to perform throwing attacks just by claiming the class. The end of the chain swung forward.

 

**BOUND**

 

It twisted around its target, rendering the goofball motionless.

“Level boosting?” Alex asked, more impressed than afraid. “Pretty lit, bro.”

“Who are you?” Will asked.

“Now you’re just hurting me, bro. You know who I am, you just haven’t seen me like this. No worries, though. It’s natural. No grudges here.”

“You’re not Alex.”

“Bro.” Alex’s expression suddenly became deathly serious. “You never knew the real me. All you saw is a puppet forced to play around. But that’s for later.”

 

**STAB**

**Surprise attack.**

**Damage increased by 1000%**

**Fatal wound inflicted.**

 

Another Alex leaped out from the corner of the room, striking the bound one. Immediately, the bound thief shattered into fragments.

*Mirror copy*, Will thought. It would have been too easy if Alex had come here in person.

“Don’t be like this, bro,” the new Alex continued. “I owe you, but you can’t go killing me.”

The thief casually glanced at the window, leaving himself open for attack.

“That’s why I came to talk to you,” he added. “You saw something there, didn’t you?”

“What do you mean?”

“The goblin realm. The town was still destroyed when I got there. And it wasn’t just some attack. There was more to it, right?”

A wave of pressure swept through Will. Despite being recently dragged into the game of eternity, he knew this to be a skill and not one belonging to the thief. It felt as if the gravity of Earth had suddenly increased by twenty percent.

“You have to tell me, bro,” the goofball continued. “For both our sakes.”

“We came upon someone else,” Will said, feeling his lips betray him. It wasn’t only the physical pressure. His body felt immediate impending doom and was ready to do anything to survive. “He was the mage, but…” The boy paused, desperately trying to keep himself from speaking further. “But also wasn’t…”

“Who did you see?” Alex asked as he stepped closer.

“Ilyan Williams,” Will spat out the words. “His name was Ilyan Williams. He was a hidden boss. A mirror mage.”

“Ilyan is dead,” the thief said with absolute certainty.

“Spenser said that, too. But… he came back somehow.”

“Well, doesn’t that sound like fun?” Alex grinned. “I owe you one more, buddy. Don’t worry, I’ll try to remind you about it.”

“Alex, what…” The boy’s mind suddenly went blank. Moments later, the weight was lifted from him.

His mind rebelled, trying to remember something, but all he could think about was that there was something not right about Alex.

“I came to talk to you, bro,” the goofball said, looking at him with a silly grin on his face. “A lot of stuff happened and I’ve been out of the loop lately. Massive fail.”

There was a certain logic to that. Had the goofball really wanted, he could have killed Will several times over. One proper stab was all it took for Will to skip the entire phase. Even now, it could still happen. There was no telling how many mirror copies were hidden all over the school. Maybe there were a few more in the bathroom itself.

“Okay.” Will pulled back his chain and put it away.

“Tell me about the alliance,” he said. “I got bits from Helen, but I want to hear more from you.”

“You spoke with Helen?” Will felt a chill again.

“I’m talking to her now, bro.” Alex laughed. “And Jace.”

There were too many unknowns to be certain what the best reaction would be. Instinctively, Will felt he should share as little as possible. After all, Danny wasn’t the only person who had said that the thief couldn’t be trusted. Did it matter, though? One way or another, they were stuck with him. Will clearly didn’t have the skills to take him out; he never did.

“We’ll be taking on archer,” he said. “That’s pretty much it.”

“For real?” Alex crossed his arms.

“I know the martial artist and the acrobat are part of the alliance. I also know that they very much needed Helen and possibly me for this to work.” He paused. “They weren’t too thrilled about you and Jace, but were okay with you joining.”

The thief laughed.

“I also know that the lancer is against us,” he added.

Should he tell him about the level boost? If Alex didn’t know already, he would have easily figured it out now.

“We did a merchant quest,” Will decided it was better to be honest than sorry. “I got to gain a plus one. The others as well.” He tapped on the mirror, scrolling to his inventory section, then took out the thief token. “I did the first level of your challenge.” Will tossed it at the goofball. “You can have it.”

Alex caught it and looked at it.

“A thief token?” Alex looked at the item. “Lit, but no thanks.” He tossed it back. “You keep it.”

Both Will's and Alex’s phones pinged.

“It’s Helen.” The goofball checked his phone. “She wants us there at once.”

“You said you were with her.”

“Yeah, but you and Jace aren’t.” Alex laughed. “Finish what you’re doing and join us. Oh, and bro…” his voice hardened. “Keep this between us. We’ll talk more later.”

He drew a dagger and stabbed himself in the stomach. As Will expected, the body of the thief shattered to pieces. Of course, that would be another mirror copy. The comment about Helen, though, was very real, so Will quickly focused on the mirror.

The first thing Will did was to glance through the map. All previous merchants and challenges had vanished. Yet, in their place, a whole new set of quests had emerged. Rather, it wasn’t that they had emerged, but had become visible there thanks to the boy’s new ability.

That explained why Daniel had been so determined to get the eye before the contest phase. While the names and rewards of the challenges were absent, the locations and prerequisites were clearly displayed. A quick glance made it clear that not a single one could be triggered by Will alone. At the same time, there were several that required a rogue, and just as many that needed a knight.

A second phone ping reminded the boy that now wasn’t the moment to waste time. There’d be other chances to go through that later. Instead, he hastily slid to the class section to check out what he had obtained.

 

**THE CLAIRVOYANT (number 16)**

**Physically weak, the CLAIRVOYANT has the ability to perceive the future and the strength of will to retain his sanity. The class grants its finder with a total of twenty skills throughout its full progression.**

**\[A good find, though difficult to handle.\]**

 

The class sounded way too powerful. There was no way that the woman who had caught Will in the mall was this, and maybe for the better. Interesting that the guide advised him against trying out this class. Will intended to do it either way, but was curious what the issue was.

The phone in his pocket rang. Helen had lost patience. Choosing not to respond, he rushed out of the bathroom, heading straight to the usual classroom. As expected, everyone was there.

“You took your time,” Helen said, ending the call. She didn’t seem particularly pleased. “What happened?”

“I had to check something,” he lied. “What’s the rush?”

“We’re in the contest phase, Stoner,” Jace grumbled. “Didn’t you get the memo?”

“Oh, shut it, Jace,” the girl snapped. “There is a rush, and it’s not about the contest phase. I got a message from the acrobat. They want to meet us at noon sharp.”

Noon meant that Will and the others would have to cut a few classes. It wasn’t a big issue. Each of them had their ways of extending their loop well into the night. Then again, it made them curious what was so special about that exact hour.

“Since we’re the new group, they let me set the place,” Helen continued.

“Moose coffee shop!” Alex shouted joyfully.

“The roof,” Helen cut his enthusiasm.

If Alex were a cartoon character, one might well imagine his ears and nose flop down. The goofball had really been looking forward to the place. But even he had to agree that the school roof provided a lot more privacy. After going through so many loops, everyone knew that no one would bother them up there.

“Rooftop in four hours,” Will mused. “We’ll have to ditch half the classes.”

“About that. They told me it was a bad idea to go wolf hunting early on,” Helen continued. “Something about rookies being taken out that way.”

“Those fuckers want us to go up there just like that?” Jace all but shouted. “Fuck ‘em!”

“We’ll be safe. We’re their allies. If they wanted us dead, they didn’t have to offer an alliance. I see your point, though.” She looked at Will. “Which is why I called everyone here. Whatever we do, we must be in total agreement.”

1k9b3uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenHack/comments/1k9b3uh/how_do_you_clean_a_burnt_stainless_steel_coffee/,How do you clean a burnt stainless steel coffee urn?,"Cleaning a burnt stainless steel coffee urn can seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach, it can be restored to near-new condition. The first step is to empty the urn and allow it to cool completely if it is still hot. Once it has cooled, remove any loose coffee grounds or debris by rinsing it with warm water. This will help prevent scratching the steel during the cleaning process.

One of the most effective methods for cleaning burnt stains is using baking soda and vinegar. Start by sprinkling a generous amount of baking soda onto the burnt areas inside the urn. Then add enough white vinegar to create a fizzing reaction. This reaction helps to loosen the burnt residue. Let the mixture sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. After it has had time to work, use a non-abrasive scrubbing pad or sponge to scrub the inside of the urn gently. Avoid using steel wool or anything too abrasive, as it can scratch the stainless steel surface.

If the stains are stubborn and do not come off easily, you can try boiling a mixture of water and vinegar inside the urn. Fill the urn about halfway with a mixture of equal parts water and vinegar and turn it on to heat. Let it come to a boil and allow it to boil for about 10 minutes. Afterward, turn off the urn and let the mixture sit for another 30 minutes to an hour. This process helps to soften the burnt-on residue, making it easier to scrub away afterward.

For extremely tough stains, a commercial stainless steel cleaner may be necessary. These cleaners are specifically designed to remove tough stains without damaging the surface. Follow the instructions on the product carefully. Always make sure to rinse the urn thoroughly after using any cleaning agents to remove any chemical residues that could affect the flavor of future coffee batches.

Another home remedy involves using a paste made from baking soda and water. Apply the paste directly to the burnt areas and let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes before scrubbing. In some cases, letting the urn soak overnight with a solution of hot water and dish soap can help loosen the burnt material, making it easier to remove the next day.

After the burnt material has been removed, it is important to thoroughly rinse and dry the coffee urn. Leaving any moisture can lead to water spots or even corrosion over time. Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe the urn completely dry. To maintain the urn and prevent future burns, always ensure that there is enough liquid inside before heating and clean the urn regularly.

Cleaning a burnt stainless steel coffee urn requires patience and the right cleaning materials, but it is usually possible to restore it without permanent damage. Regular maintenance and gentle cleaning practices can keep the urn looking good and functioning properly for years.",1,1745779185.0,KitchenHack,0,1.0,False

The brew that comes out of it is vaguely coffee-flavored hot water. 

I ordered a Pike Place and it was awful. They replaced it with a darker-roast Sumatra. Weak, weak, weak. 

I’ve never been served weak coffee in a Starbucks before. (And, no, I don’t have COVID, and if I did, the current strains usually don’t cause loss of smell and taste.) 🤷‍♀️

Anyone else have a similar experience with this? I’m wondering whether their machine is malfunctioning or if they’re now being designed to dispense weaker coffee.

While I was there, I was just drinking whatever coffee was nearby; I didn't have any sort of coffee agenda while I was there. I happened by this place called Ministry of Roasters, and I was immediately put off by what I thought was a pretentious name and a very pretentious cafe. My friend wanted to try it, though, and I got a cappuccino. I'm very glad, because it rocked my world.

I liked all the roasts I tried there, but one in particular was my favorite, and I took some beans home. They called this one Palad. It's a pretty light roast, and I find it aggressively fruity, which I love. Even on my home equipment it was more exciting to me than any other coffee I was drinking.

As I'm finishing up the last of the beans I brought home, I thought I'd post here. Does anyone know this coffee? It doesn't seem that they ship to the US, where I live.

I'm a 26-year-old from Italy, currently living in Paris. As some of my friends will be moving away soon, I thought it would be a good time to meet new people and expand my social circle. :)

I enjoy a lot of things — trying new food (of course!), visiting museums and exhibitions, exploring cultural events, hanging out at pubs or discos, playing board games, and chatting about life and everything else.

I'm also passionate about languages: currently focusing on French, Catalan, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. If anyone is learning Italian, I'd be happy to help — and maybe share a few pasta secrets too! 🍝

If you're up for grabbing a coffee, visiting an exhibition, or just chatting, feel free to message me!

I 25M took out my sister 18F to my friend’s wedding. So while returning we decided to drive around GS road to enjoy the night city vibe.

I was driving around 40 kmph while my sister was sipping cold coffee. While approaching Bhangaghar flyover, two guys in an electric scooter drives near my window and shows me the hand gesture of sexual intercourse with fingers and other sexually suggestive gestures . Then he shouts at me saying “Humein bhi karne do humein bhi maza lene do”. My sister was visibly scared and shocked. I honked and blinked my flashers to the guys asking ‘’Ki hol oi’’ the guy driving the scooter looks at me and says “kuch nhi maaf kar dijie” while the guy behind him continues to repeat his gestures. My sister was scared and embarrassed.

Backstory- I have raised my sister to be an independent and respectful person. I have always motivated her to stand for herself and lead a fearless life and till now she has always lived that way. I am a proud brother and have always appreciated how she has the ability to say no to things and stand up her herself. She’s going yo college this year and I want her to continue living her life in this manner. I don’t want such incident to traumatise her and leave a scar on her psyche or make her vulnerable to bullying in the future.

Story Continued - My sister who was visibly scared asked me to stop. Then I made the decision as I believe that the only way of overcoming fear or trauma is to face it. I stepped on the pedal and chased them to the flyover. There was a GMC cleaning truck occupying the right lane so I chased them through the left lane. When the scooter driver realised that I have taken this seriously he starts apologising that he is sorry while the guys behind him continues with his antics. Till then the decision was made I have decided that I will chase him down. I hand my phone to my sister where the number of the local police officer is saved and I tell her to stay in the car if I have to leave it and call some numbers. Now I chase the scooter. They tried to trick me by taking the left turn in the abc tiniali but I stopped them with my car. I rushed out of my car and while they try to accelerate.

In Guwahati the situation is much worse compared to other parts of assam. Had it been some non localite of Guwahati they would have gotten away as the non localites would have been scared of escalating it further and would end up traumatising themselves. Also I wanted my sister to belief that if she is ever bullied, there will always be someone who will hunt each of them down. Hence set an example.

They smell like their names and I wouldn’t say that they’re exactly like Summer Fridays but you can tell they were inspired by them. The Vanilla Toffee smells more sweet than Summer Fridays’ Vanilla shades. Java Chip smells like coffee with dark chocolate to me. I really like the scents and I don’t usually like very strong sweet scents (I found Tower 28’s Dulce De Leche way too overpowering and I barely reach for it) so these ones are kinda in the middle. You can definitely smell them but they won’t give you a headache. I’d say Vanilla Toffee is very warm tone and Java Chip is very cool tone. Java Chip gives more purple than brown on my lips. But they both look natural. 

The consistency is thin, kinda like the Summer Fridays ones and not so much like Olehenriksen. 

I did find them moisturizing but not long term moisturizing. With Olehenrisken I still feel like my lips are moisturized even after the product is gone. It’s kinda like a lip mask for me. It’s not really the same with Elf or Summer Fridays. However, they did not dry out my lips. 

Overall, I like these. Definitely worth 9$ and I do feel like it’s not a bad alternative to Summer Fridays and with 15$ price difference these are worth it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why Choose Sous Vide for Cheesecake?

When it comes to making cheesecake, getting a smooth, creamy texture without cracks can be challenging. Traditional baking methods often lead to uneven cooking, overbaked edges, or a cracked surface. Using a sous vide technique changes the game entirely. Cooking your cheesecake sous vide means cooking it gently and evenly at a low temperature, which helps create a custard-like consistency. This technique cuts down on stress because it’s forgiving, and it locks in moisture, ensuring that your cheesecake comes out perfectly every time.

Cooking sous vide allows you to control the exact temperature, avoiding sudden spikes that cause cracks. The water bath surrounds the cheesecake, cooking it consistently, which helps prevent those dreaded dry spots or uneven cooking. Plus, with sous vide, there’s no need to worry about the cheesecake overcooking because the water won’t exceed your set temperature.

### Essential Ingredients and Tools for a Perfect Sous Vide Cheesecake

Getting the right ingredients and tools makes a big difference in mastering sous vide cheesecake with zero cracks and zero stress:

- **Cream Cheese:** Use full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature for a smooth batter.
- **Sour Cream:** Adds tang and creaminess while balancing the sweetness.
- **Eggs:** Act as the binding agent but avoid overbeating to prevent air bubbles.
- **Granulated Sugar:** Sweetens the cheesecake without altering the texture.
- **Vanilla Extract:** Enhances the flavor naturally.
- **Graham Cracker Crust:** Pre-baked and pressed firmly into the pan for a crunchy base.
- **Vacuum-Sealed Bag or Jar with Lid:** To hold the cheesecake while cooking sous vide.
- **Precision Sous Vide Cooker and Water Bath:** For accurate temperature control and even cooking.

### Step-by-Step Process for Flawless Results

#### Preparing the Cheesecake Mixture

Start by beating the cream cheese until it is completely smooth and lump-free. Adding softened cream cheese prevents clumps in your batter, which can disrupt texture. Incorporate sugar gradually, then beat in eggs one at a time. Adding eggs slowly helps create an even batter and reduces air bubbles, which can cause cracks during cooking. add sour cream and vanilla extract for flavor and creaminess.

#### Setting Up the Crust and Cake

Firmly press your graham cracker crust in your preferred pan. A springform pan works well, but individual glass jars are ideal to sous vide because they can be sealed tightly. Pour the cheesecake batter over the crust, making sure to smooth the surface without overworking the batter.

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​  
  
#### Sealing and Cooking** If you use a springform pan, wrap it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil to avoid water seeping in. For jar cooking, seal the jar with a lid. Place your cheesecake setup into the preheated water bath. Most recipes recommend cooking at 176°F (80°C) for around 1) 60-90 minutes. Adjust timing based on the size and container.

### Tips to Prevent Cracks and Achieve Creamy Texture

- **Use a Gentle Temperature:** Cooking your cheesecake slowly at the correct temperature helps avoid uneven expansion that might cause cracks.
- **Avoid Overbeating Batter:** Too much air in the batter creates bubbles that burst and crack during cooking.
- **Don’t Overcook:** The cheesecake should be just set but still slightly jiggly in the center for creamy perfection.
- **Use a Water Seal:** Properly sealing your pan or jars avoids water ingress that can make the crust soggy.
- **Cool Gradually:** Let your cheesecake cool in the water bath or room temperature before refrigeration to reduce cracks caused by sudden temperature changes.

### Post-Cooking Care to Maintain That Perfect Look and Taste

After cooking, chill the cheesecake in the refrigerator for at least four hours, preferably overnight. This rest time firms up the texture and enhances flavor. Because the cheesecake is sous vide cooked gently, there’s no matte, cracked surface to smooth out—just a perfectly even, glossy finish. When ready to serve, you can add fresh fruit, a drizzle of chocolate, or your favorite topping without worrying about messy cracks ruining your presentation.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not sealing the container properly:** Water can leak in and ruin the crust.
- **Cooking at too high a temperature:** Can cause overcooking and cracking.
- **Rushing the chilling process:** Cooling too fast can create surface cracks.
- **Using cold cream cheese:** Causes lumps and inconsistent texture.
- **Skipping the water bath:** Direct heat baking can't produce the same smooth texture found in sous vide cheesecakes.

### Unlocking New Flavors with Sous Vide Cheesecake

Sous vide cooking doesn’t just make cheesecakes smooth and crack-free; it also unlocks new ways to infuse flavor. You can add ingredients like citrus zest, coffee, or spices directly into the batter without worrying about scorching or uneven baking. The gentle temperature preserves delicate flavors that often get lost with oven baking. Plus, cooking in jars means you can make individual puddings or layered desserts with ease.

### Final Thoughts on Stress-Free Cheesecake

If you’ve ever been frustrated by cracked cheesecakes or dry textures, embracing sous vide is a game changer. This method ensures consistent heat, gentle cooking, and a perfectly creamy texture with a glossy, crack-free finish. Follow the simple steps shared here, and you’ll be enjoying flawless, stress-free cheesecake every time—impressing family and friends with your baking skills without the usual worry or lengthy oven watch.

By mastering sous vide cheesecake, you’re adding a reliable, innovative technique to your dessert repertoire that brings sweet success with every bite.

Comparing Traditional Baking vs. Sous Vide Methods for Perfect Cheesecake Results
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Basics of Cheesecake Preparation

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​** When it comes to crafting the perfect cheesecake, the method you choose can dramatically affect texture, consistency, and overall success. Traditional baking has long been the go-to method in kitchens worldwide. This involves mixing cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients, then baking in an oven at a controlled temperature, often with a water bath to reduce cracking. However, this method can be tricky. Temperature fluctuations cause cracks and uneven textures, leading to a less-than-ideal dessert.

On the other hand, the sous vide technique has gained popularity among both home cooks and professional chefs for making cheesecake. This method involves vacuum-sealing the cheesecake batter and cooking it in a temperature-controlled water bath for an extended period. The result? A creamy, smooth cheesecake with no cracks and minimal stress involved in the process.

### Key Differences Between Traditional Baking and Sous Vide Methods

#### Temperature Control

Traditional ovens can have uneven heating, and the cheesecake batter often bakes unevenly. This can result in overcooked edges and a center that is still underdone. Even when using a water bath, hot spots or sudden temperature changes may crack the surface of the cheesecake.

Sous vide, however, offers precise temperature control. By sealing the cheesecake and submerging it in water held at an exact temperature, the cheesecake cooks evenly throughout. This ensures the perfect texture without risk of overheating or cracking.

#### Texture and Consistency

Baked cheesecakes made with traditional methods tend to have a firm, dense texture. While still delicious, some people find that the edges can dry out or become rubbery. Also, overbaking, a common problem, leads to cracks on the surface and a less creamy consistency.

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​** In contrast, sous vide cheesecakes maintain a velvety smooth texture. Because the batter cooks slowly and gently in a sealed environment, the proteins set gradually, preserving moisture and resulting in an ultra-creamy finish. This texture is difficult to achieve through regular baking.

#### Risk of Cracks

One of the biggest frustrations with baking cheesecake traditionally is avoiding cracks. As the cheesecake cools, the surface tends to contract and split, especially if the oven temperature is too high or if the cake is removed abruptly from the heat.

Sous vide cheesecake eliminates this problem because it cooks gently at a low temperature and cools gradually inside the water bath. The sealed environment also prevents air from drying out the surface, meaning no cracks form, and the cheesecake looks flawless.

#### Cooking Time and Convenience

Traditional baking usually requires 45 to 60 minutes or more, plus additional cooling time. Sometimes, you’ll need to check the cake multiple times to prevent burning or cracking. Because of the required precision, baking cheesecake can feel stressful, especially for beginners.

Sous vide takes longer—typically 1.5 to 2 hours—but it allows you to “set it and forget it” without much supervision. Once the vacuum-sealed cheesecake is submerged, the sous vide circulator maintains a perfect cooking temperature. You can multitask without worrying about overcooking.

### Advantages of Choosing the Sous Vide Method for Cheesecake

- **Consistent Results:** Every cheesecake cooked sous vide has a uniform texture and no cracks, ensuring perfect slices every time.
- **Hands-Off Cooking:** Requires minimal checking, which frees up your time in the kitchen.
- **Enhanced Flavor:** The airtight environment traps all flavors, giving the cheesecake a richer taste.
- **Improved Moisture Retention:** Prevents the cheesecake from drying out, maintaining a creamy mouthfeel.

### When Traditional Baking Makes the Most Sense** Despite the sous vide advantages, traditional baking remains popular for several reasons:

- **No Special Equipment Needed:** Most home kitchens already have an oven but may lack sous vide devices and vacuum sealers.
- **Quick Preparation for Small Batches:** If you need a cheesecake fast and in small quantity, baking might be more efficient.
- **Classic Textural Preference:** Some people enjoy the firmer texture and slightly caramelized edges that oven baking produces.
- **Presentation Options:** Baking allows you to add toppings or broil the surface for a golden finish.

### Tips for Perfecting Both Methods

Whether you lean towards traditional baking or want to try sous vide cheesecake, here are some expert tips:

- **For Traditional Baking:** Use a water bath to moderate oven heat and reduce cracking. Avoid overmixing to prevent excess air incorporation.
- **For Sous Vide Cooking:** Vacuum seal carefully to avoid leaks. Use a springform pan that fits your vacuum bag to keep shape intact.
- **Cooling:** Allow the cheesecake to cool gradually—ideally in the water bath for sous vide—to prevent sudden temperature shock.
- **Ingredient Quality:** Use full-fat cream cheese and fresh eggs for a rich, smooth texture in either method.

### Final Thoughts on Achieving Cheesecake Perfection

Choosing between traditional baking and sous vide methods boils down to your kitchen setup, time, and texture preferences. If you want a creamy, flawless cheesecake with no cracking and minimal stress, sous vide is a game-changer. It provides precise control and reliable, tender results that delight every time.

However, if you prefer classic routines and the comforting feel of baking, mastering temperature control and water bath techniques can still deliver excellent cheesecakes. Understanding the strengths and limits of each method empowers you to craft cheesecakes that suit your taste and lifestyle perfectly.

### Conclusion

Mastering the art of sous vide cheesecake opens a world where achieving a smooth, crack-free dessert becomes effortless. Unlike traditional baking, which often leads to uneven cooking and stress over cracks forming, the sous vide method offers precise temperature control. This gentle and consistent heat ensures your cheesecake cooks evenly, preserving a creamy texture and flawless appearance every time you try.

Traditional baking requires close attention to water baths, oven temperature fluctuations, and careful timing to avoid those frustrating cracks and dry edges. Sous vide takes away these worries by immersing the cheesecake in a precisely heated water bath, maintaining a stable environment that gently sets the custard. This way, you get a rich, silky cheesecake that’s perfectly cooked from edge to center.

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​** Not only does sous vide provide reliability, but it also allows room for creativity. You can experiment with different flavors and textures without fearing the usual baking mishaps.

If you want to elevate your cheesecake game, adopting the sous vide technique is a game changer. It’s a simple switch that delivers delicious results with less effort and worry.

The PNHYTUGY cold brew coffee maker caught my attention right out of the box. The sleek and functional design screams practicality, with its heavy-duty soda lime glass construction that feels sturdy yet lightweight. Its ergonomic handle is more than a random design detail—it really offers that secure grip you appreciate when maneuvering a 64-ounce capacity jar. The black accents add a touch of elegance to my kitchen, making it as much a piece of decor as it is a functional coffee maker. What sets this apart, though, is the thoughtful addition of a leak-proof lid and precision pour spout. The airtight silicone seal ensures no unwanted spills happen, which has been a lifesaver in my fridge.

[Check PNHYTUGY cold brew coffee maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d5yfhywh/)

**Performance and User Experience**

Brewing coffee in this coffee maker feels like a breeze. The included stainless-steel filter is a marvel, featuring a super-dense, 160-micron mesh. I’ve tried brewing coffee, tea, and even infusing fruits for flavored water, and it handles everything like a pro—leaving no grounds, tea leaves, or pulp behind. The coffee always comes out smooth, rich in flavor, and without any pesky sediment ruining the experience. On mornings when I need an immediate caffeine fix, its ease of use never fails me.

**Highlights**

- The thickened handle offers enhanced grip for easy carrying.  
- Airtight spout ensures no spills or unwanted fridge odors.  
- Versatile usage beyond cold brew coffee—great for tea, fruit-infused drinks, and more.

**Drawbacks**

- The glass construction, while durable, means you need to handle it with care to avoid potential cracks.  
- For larger households, the 64-ounce capacity may feel limiting if everyone wants an iced coffee simultaneously.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning the coffee maker is as enjoyable as using it. Its wide-mouth design makes it simple to pour in ingredients or scrub after use. Most days, I rinse it out and pop it into the dishwasher without a second thought, and so far, it has maintained its clarity and elegance. A nice bonus is that it doesn’t retain lingering smells, even after multiple uses for different beverages. The included cleaning brush is also a handy addition, especially for the fine-mesh filter that might otherwise take extra effort to clean.

**Materials and Durability**

The cold brew coffee maker’s build quality genuinely shines. The soda lime glass feels robust without making the pitcher overly heavy, and the BPA-free lid is a reassuring nod to those mindful of health and safety. However, caution is necessary here—it’s sturdy against regular wear and tear but not immune to sudden temperature shocks. I accidentally poured boiling water into it once and noticed a slight cracking noise, though it held up without actual visible damage. Lesson learned! 

**Competing Brands**

If we’re talking competitors, the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker comes to mind. While both products share similar functions, the Takeya model offers more lightweight plastic construction, which some may see as a pro for portability but a con in durability. Compared to the Hario Mizudashi, this product trumps with a larger capacity and a much more ergonomic handle for ease of use. What makes this PNHYTUGY model stand out most is its multiple features, from the dense stainless steel filter to the airtight silicone seal—which isn’t as polished in most alternatives.

**Value for Money**

This product strikes a fine balance between quality and functionality, making it a smart investment for coffee enthusiasts. While the price point could be higher than basic pitchers, you’re paying for impressive durability, a premium filter system, and versatility. Given that I save money by brewing at home instead of hitting up coffee shops for my iced coffee fix, this maker has already justified its cost. For anyone looking to get the most out of their brewing experience, it’s a worthwhile addition to the kitchen counter.

1k9amb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/1k9amb0/teen_sex_question/,Teen sex question,"I have a 15 year old girl who up until recently hasn’t been interested in boys. 

As a little preface for context. She has always been open, honest and communicative with me. I have always done everything I can to give her (and both her brothers ages 13 and 23) some measure of privacy when it comes to friends, phones, computers, etc. I do check devices and social media. I know passwords and all that. They have an open door to talk to me about anything with zero judgment. And they have all used that many many times over the years. None of them have never ever betrayed my trust. Sure, they’ve been caught in the occasional lie here and there about little things but not anything big where it would completely demolish the years of trust built up. 

Back to mg 15 year old. She’s been interested in a boy. Her age and grade. She’s been open about the conversations they’re having (and of course she knows I can read all texts and such to verify if I want/need to). She’s asked me about sex and intimacy. I told her that I’d be stupid to think that teens aren’t going to make out but as far as sex, that’s more of an adult decision. It’s not to be taken lightly. I told her that at her age it’s a bit too young to be thinking about it and there’s a lot of possible physical and emotional consequences. I told her that people can be intimate without taking clothes off and having sex. I’ve met this boy, I’ve met and had coffee with his parents. He’s very polite, opens doors for her, etc. I know they’ve made out a little because she told me. So when she asked to have him over yesterday, with my husband supervising and brothers in the house (I had to work) and laid out VERY specific ground rules I didn’t think I had to worry. 

Again for context, we have a 2 story house, small home and the upstairs is literally just 2 bedrooms. Her bedroom is downstairs. If you’re sitting in the living room and just lean over a little bit from any seating you can get a full view of her room. Her room also used to be an office and has a French door with the little windows and she does have a curtain on it but you can still peek inside without opening the door. 

Because she’s also been open and honest and never betrayed my trust, I allowed her to have her door closed. I just wanted her to have a tiny bit of privacy because our house is small so their conversation wasn’t being heard by everyone in the house. I get it. I was 15 once too. I laid out very specific rules. No hanky panky, no sex, clothes on at ALL TIMES. Her father was right there in the living room. He was checking in. Above all I trusted her. But they managed to get naked and were caught in the act when my husband walked in on them. 

I know, I know. Big mistake on my part with the door. I should have just said oh well, too bad, door open. I’m beating myself up enough about the parenting mistakes I made. What I don’t know how to process is: what do I do? I’ve never been in this position before. Luckily she’s been on the pill since she was 13 because of bad menstrual cycle issues. She said he didn’t finish. She said that he claims this was his first time. I told her if she has any symptoms, itching, rash, anything she must immediately report them to me. 

And I don’t know if this is weird but it’s not so much that she did it (although I much would prefer she hadn’t) but the betrayal of my trust in her. That just hurts me and cuts so deep. I yelled, I screamed, I told her to perish the thought of ever seeing him again but beyond that, like I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to process the hurt. I don’t know how and how long it will take for her to earn my trust again. As I questioned her in my mind I’m going “yeah but is that the truthful answer” something I’ve never had to ask myself. 

Sorry this is so long. I just feel alone, hurt and my husband is no help. He’s just shy of useless (which is probably how it happened and I should have just told her she had to wait to have the boy over when I had a weekend off work) so it’s just me trying to figure this out. 

Thanks for reading.

I used to love coffee, savory foods, vegetables, and meat. Now I don't drink coffee (but I do drink gallons of iced tea), and prefer lighter, sweeter foods. I eat a lot of cottage cheese, yogurt, various fruits, and a small amount of meat, but even that doesn't taste good to me any more. I'm going to add another protein shake every day and start experimenting with beans, rice, and tofu. I don't eat anything in large portions, so I seem to be doing fine with slightly higher carbs per day (in the 100-150 grams range) within a ~1400 calorie per day framework.

1k9akem,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaidcoreMusic/comments/1k9akem/the_maidcore_index_v10/,The Maidcore Index [v1.0],"#**1. Initial considerations**  
Hi, hello, welcome. This is a compilation of a lot of links, and when I say a lot, I do mean it. As of posting this, there's already half of the maximum 40k characters allowed by Reddit, so take of that what you will. There's not just maid, but also artists inertwined with the world of maidcore, youtube channels, videos, and more. I want this to be a go-to resource for anyone looking for something specific, so I tried my best to be as thorough as possible.  
Before we begin with the linkdumping, though, there are some thing that I would like to clear up beforehand, so as to not cause any confusion later on. Don't worry, it's nothing too serious, and anything here written can be subjected to change depending on the community input. I'd also like to point out that this is probably much better viewed from a computer screen.  
Firstly, I won't be putting ***all*** the links to all platforms, since there are a lot of maids and I'm already wasting characters by writing this. My plan is to have the most links to all maids (that I know of as of writing this) and [honorary maids](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaidcoreMusic/comments/1k4ix2q/comment/moaox8z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  
Secondly, to make it easier on myself, I'll be using acronyms instead of the full names of the websites. To make it easier for you, the reader, the acronyms used will be listed below:  

[BB] - BiliBili  
[BC] - Bandcamp  
[BS] - BlueSky  
[IG] - Instagram  
[FB] - Facebook  
[IA] - Internet Archive  
[R] - Reddit  
[SC] - SoundCloud  
[T] - Telegram  
[TW] - Twitch  
[TT] - TikTok  
[VK] - VKontakte  
[YT] - Youtube  
[X] - Twitter  

Now, with that out of the way, we can finally get started!

#**2. Artists**  
In this part we will be going through the artists within maidcore, both maids and non maids, though I will be separating them. I will make it clear that I will not be including Spotify links, since they are pretty damn long and I want as much space as I can get for any future changes. I also won't be putting links to donation websites, since they are very incosistent between all the maids. If you really want to support your favorite maid, you should be able to find it without my help. If you guys feel like it should be here, though, please do communicate as so. I'm trying to make the best index as I can, so any community input is very much appreciated.
#2.1. Maids  
These are the classical ones, those who have adorned themselves with the garment of a true maid, be it for a little side project or as their form to express their feelings. Each and every maid has a different story to tell, unique tales that all deserve to be heard, their particular trajectoris through life that led them all into this weird little community. Well, I think that's enough rambling. You aren't here for that, now are you? Fine. Here's the list. Make sure you don't get lost~

#2.1. Honorary maids  
These are not exactly maids, but they have been either making in kind of the same style as maidcore or have been contributing (making music, participating in collabs, etc) to the community for so long that they might as well be given a duster and get right onto cleaning with the de facto maids. This part would be a lot more empty if not for [KaitaiSurale](https://www.youtube.com/kaitaisurale1990), so if you haven't already do go check him out in his own part of this post.

#**3. Other stuff**
Now we're getting close to the end. Just a little bit more. Now we'll be talking about other relevant websites and people who aren't exactlr maids, not een honorary ones. Think of compilation channels, wikis, lists, community gatherings, and such.
#3.1. Compilation channels
These are folks whose channels are all dedicated to promoting maids and honorary maids. Their very expansive archive helped me lots in finding new maids and getting all the links I needed. I'm putting here only those channels who are focused solely on maidcore, as there are way too many channels who have at some point made compilations that include maidcore.

#3.4. Some videos on Maidcore
Neither music videos nor compilations, just full-on long-form content about maidcore. There aren't a lot, and, since I don't really know russian and yt search sucks, I will definetly let some pass, so please do link me any videos that are not included here. Same goes for any of the previous categories.

#4. Final considerations
This whole gathering of lists was done done on my free time (well, mostly by neglecting my ohter hobbies since I wanted to get this done reasonably quickly), so I know for a fact that it is far from perfect. Even while writing these last few parts I stumbled upon maids I hadn't seen before, so who knows who else is hiding just around the corner, broomstick in hand, ready to get on this line of job. For the time being, I'll try to keep this index somewhat updated, but who knows for how long this motivation will last.  
If you know an artist, a channel, a group chat or whatever that hasn't been included in here, please do let me know. This list is most definetly not perfect, and Maidcore is not a static thing, so I hope this list isn't the final version of it. If it ever comes a time (and I'm sure it will, eventually) when this whole thing starts gathering dust in the corner, unattended, I kindly ask that someone keep working on it. This whole thing wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the already existing resources available around the community, and my only wish with this is to make it easier for folks getting into maidcore to get the most out of their experience. After all, there are some *really* obscure maids, some of which you can't even find anything about them anymore!

*(Oh, also, if there's any error, be it a dead link not properly labeled, something out of order or a typo somewhere, do notify me as well. English isn't my first language, so sometimes errors slip right through my keyboard and into whatever I'm writing without me noticing okay byyye~)*",2,1745777806.0,MaidcoreMusic,0,1.0,False
1k9ahp4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9ahp4,Part 2: Help me pick my coffee table!!!,"Removed my throws for a blanker canvas + more angles of the grey in my apartment + current coffee table.

Are we still thinking round & dark?? I personally feel like warm and dark won’t mesh with the rest of the apartment and the cool grey tones I hate so much. Size came up a lot and I definitely want a larger table than I have, even if a little scooting will be necessary! Hopefully round will give me a little more space. 

I agree that more contrast is needed but would like to get that elsewhere if plausible. My throws came from my previous dark couch so can definitely change that up. A few suggested a console behind the couch which I do have (hard to see) that I usually fill with seasonal decorations, photos, candles- you get it. The area rug is for another post another day lol.

I got rid of all but one of the square tables as suggested for my knees. I added in a few round and darks. My personal favorite is #5. Are we still overwhelmingly dark & round? Thanks so much if you came back!! ",1,1745777609.0,interiordecorating,4,1.0,False

Sunshine is visiting today. Not quite ready for the adventure yet. Perhaps a few more pages of the fun book or a few more sips of coffee. ☕️
