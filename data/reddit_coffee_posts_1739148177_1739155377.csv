1ilvv9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ilvv9y/for_you/,For you,"I feel awful over what happened and the way that it played out particularly for you. 
It was not and is not something I have been able to let go of and carry with me. 

If I feel this terrible most days, I have to figure that what you went through was my most terrible time amplified and for that, I am filled with dread and the likely realization that I will never hear from you again. 

I do love you. I've missed you and thought about you in ways that have brought great pain and confusion in regards to what would possibly compel me to say such mean things to the love of my life. To the only person who ever knew me. Loved me. Was sweet, kind, and loving to me. Connected with and spent years of our lives together which I truly cherished. 
And in return for all of that, I've let you down. 
I've managed to scare you off and block myself from likely ever hearing your sweet soft voice ever again. 
I'm not able to know or hear how you are doing. I am not able to be anything more in your eyes then this terrible person. I hate that. Because I don't hate you at all. I don't think you're terrible. I look back on things almost daily as they come to me. Time has given me clarity and perspective I wish I had then before I made the biggest mistake of my life.

You're not an enigma to me. I see you for you and love you as you are no matter what. To know and understand that but have operated in a way that showed enormous jealousy and confusion will be the bereavement of my entire life. That I was so foolish and arrogant and a tactician of being mean and saying wicked things that I regret but can't take back. If you weren't on my mind daily, I would have never thought to look on reddit. To read a very similar situation posted across boards. I was only able to speculate that it must have been you but since the person disappeared over nite along with their posts, I will never know. 

I have the feeling that I will never know a lot of things. Starting with the gap of years in our ages. I felt that I could easily relate to you but stupidly, didn't take your advice to calm down and chill out. Those years of life you have on me are wisdom that can only be earned by living on this earth and experiencing life. I should have been grateful and listened. I should have appreciated your presence. It was literally the only thing I had ever hoped for anyway.
To look you in the eyes and be met with that tippie toe kiss I've missed for so long that I attribute to you and only you. 

So if you are reading this... therapy has been stressful for me. The therapist seems to be blaming you and I don't see it that way. I feel awful for what I've done because I know it hurt you, then you wanted to hurt me back the best and most effective way possible which was by cutting off contact and leaving me with silence and nothing else but loneliness to connect myself and my thoughts and to put it all together. 

I do know that you would do anything for someone you loved. Take enormous risks just to be together and I've wondered if you haven't grown addicted to that part. The doing what you shouldn't do but can part. How I'm left to think of what to do about all of this if there is even anything to be done but take it for the loss it is and pray that I don't relapse and return back to the hell of addiction. 
I'm grateful for the clean time that I have, but hardly an accomplishment to someone who doesn't understand addiction. 30 months that I've thought of throwing away each and every day, but by doing that, I would likely lose the last vestige of hope that is attached to my life. Hope that I literally fought for and hope I would be devastated if I just threw away. 

I would think that it would have been easier to just give up. But I'm stubborn in the sense that I don't want to. I want to have a good day. I want to have a sleep without these dreams in which I wake up in full realization and dread as to you being gone and me being the reason why. 

What have i done? I ask myself over and over again. What the fuck have I done? All I ever wanted out of life was to have this meaningful person's presence in my life once again. I felt that if that could have happened, that I had acquired the most important of all I had wished for and could ever wish for. 

What the fuck have i done? 

I miss her. That's for sure.

Thought about writing her directly a lot but went against it because i didn't know what to say. How to word it. How to help her. So I decided against it. 

The only person i ever loved. The only person who had the ability to move me by just looking at me. Had the ability to turn emotions and feelings into tangible real things with a simple kiss. The only person that meant anything to me and i had believed for so long that I could experience once again in my life that connection I so sorely missed and had thought and even dreamt about for years. 

 
I had reached out and she returned to me, I got to see her, I looked forward to hearing her voice first thing in the morning with coffee and ending it by telling eachother goodnight. I loved the idea of video calling which was something I never cared to do with anyone and I had all of these things but still managed to fuck it all up. 

So I just keep pushing forward and when I am able to break away and sit down and write, I will. I'm not going to ever be ashamed of how I feel and it's important to me that this person if out there wherever you are, that you are safe and okay. That I have had you on my mind heavily the past few days and then for the hell of it two nites ago started searching reddit and might have possibly come across you. But can't know for sure. 

What I do know is that you are loved. You are missed. That you will likely never know what loneliness is and for that, I am grateful. I wish for you to heal and love your life as you always have and if a resolution is at all possible, I will surely figure it out and if not, then I will pay the price surely by losing you.

1ilvv6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ilvv6j/did_i_do_something_wrong/,Did I do something wrong?,"So I‚Äôm a 33M that has never dated before and I recently joined the apps and matched with a woman 31F on Hinge. We messaged back and forth for about a week and had good conversation about mutual interest so I asked if she‚Äôd like to meetup for coffee and she said she‚Äôd love to. Our schedules didn‚Äôt align well, but eventually we were able to figure out a day and time based on her suggestion, which was a few days out. 

We kept messaging in the meantime and she seemed genuinely excited, but then on the day of the date she cancelled several hours before saying she had a really busy past couple of days and mentally wasn‚Äôt up to socializing that night. I said no worries I understand and thanked her for letting me know. Then said to let me know when she‚Äôd like to reschedule. She messaged back thanking me for understanding and then suggested connecting on Discord for a call first since we were having trouble with our schedules. I said sure I‚Äôd be down for that but mentioned I never used Discord, and added a little joke about it since we had talked a lot about gaming and I thought it might sound a little weird that I game a lot but don‚Äôt use Discord. Anyway, I told her I‚Äôd go ahead and create an account and then we could figure out when we could have a call. But then after 5 days, she didn‚Äôt respond. 

Now we never were super quick to respond but generally both of us would respond within a day or two at most. So it was kinda weird to not hear from her after 5 days. Then I noticed that she had updated her profile some sometime since the last message sent. So I‚Äôm really just confused. I sent a quick follow up yesterday morning just asking if she‚Äôd still like to have a call but haven‚Äôt heard anything back. 

To me it would‚Äôve made more sense that if she wanted to just stop responding she would‚Äôve done it after cancelling the date and not then further suggesting having a call first since our schedules didn‚Äôt align. I‚Äôm really confused why she would suggest that if she wasn‚Äôt interested and wanted to just back out. 

So did I do or say something wrong? Like I said this is my first time trying to date so I‚Äôm just confused about it all and trying to learn. ",1,1739155071.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ilvujh,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ilvujh/how_long_until_i_know_im_a_winning_player/,How long until I know I'm a winning player.,"I started playing poker about a year ago. I got insanely lucky the first two times I played somehow winning about 3k in my first two sessions despite actually being an awful player.

From there I proceeded to lose money until I was down about to about negative 8k lifetime.

After that I kind of took a step back and learned how to play the game. I had two main breakthroughs which were learning the basic math and also realizing that I needed to be folding more preflop when other people were raising.

From there I continued to lose for two months but the amount I was losing went down substantially.

Then I had three months where I made a little bit of money (about 300-500) dollars a month. It seems like I've been playing pretty consistently now. I tend to make about 20 dollars an hour playing 1-3 nlh. I still don't think I'm a good player. I just play more conservatively than a lot of people. I still lose a decent amount of money because I'll play for too long and get sloppy.

I'm comfortable being a losing player long term if I only lose 500 dollars a month. At that point it's a hobby and is honestly worth the food and coffee discount.

When will I know that I've gotten to the point where I'm a winning player instead of a losing player?

I used to do fan surveys just as something fun to look at, and they fizzled out when I ran out of worthwhile questions. However, I‚Äôm back for a certain reason: I want a more nuanced look at character popularity. Google forms allows ranked voting, which I think might be more informative towards determining an OVERALL fandom attitude towards characters. This might be especially interesting for characters like Mike and Emily who rank high on both favorite and least favorite character lists. Rather than just seeing how each character ranks when the question forces a best or worst (because the ranking doesn‚Äôt really indicate how a person feels about each character on average‚Äîanother example is Matt whom few rank as a favorite but isn‚Äôt the overall least favorite either), I want to see a general attitude.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have a follow up appointment with my doctor next week, and I need to figure something out.   


&nbsp;

**Background/context:** I have been on Mounjaro successfully for well over a year. I've titrated all the way up to 15mg, and was on that dose for over 9 months. My starting weight was around 340, and I lost down to 230. However, around August, my weight loss basically stopped. I gained/lost the same 3-4 lbs for almost 5 months. Then in December, I was hospitalized with a bowel obstruction. That sucked. They couldn't tell me why it happened. In my opinion...it happened because I believe I wasn't hydrating nearly well enough. I was drinking way too many coffees, and not enough water. I then had a follow up appointment with my doctor who basically stated ""We should take you off Mounjaro"". I pushed back, advising that I have enjoyed better glucose control (I am a T2D), and would like to stay on the drug, as I have read that coming off can cause weight gain, and that I still have 50ish lbs to lose. 

He stated he wanted to move me down in dose, to 7.5mg. I asked if we could try 10 at least, and he agreed. 

For 4 weeks now, I have been on 10mg after being on 15mg for months. ***I have regained 12 lbs.*** I am drinking more water, and have changed no other habits, eating the same level of calories/etc, usually around 1500 a day max. 

&nbsp;

**Some additional context:** For months nowI feel absolutely, overly full no matter what I eat. Small portion or not, and I feel stuffed.. often. It always feels like I am catching up in digestion, if that makes sense. That has not gotten better, although I do not appear to be digesting so slow to cause the gastrointestinal issue I had before. I also suspect a few things in the diet arent great. I eat keto (have for a while), and thinking I need to resimplify my diet. I keep electrolytes well in tune (I use LMNT packets) but probably need to hydrate even more than I am (avg 100-120oz a day now). 

**Medications**

* 20mg Etizimbie
* 20mg Lisinopril
* 10mg Mounjaro
* 3 Psylliym Husk Tablets daily
* CVS Probiotic
* Mild workout regiment (Could do better here)

***TLDR:*** Doc moved me from 15-10mg after a hospitalization for bowel obstruction. Ive regained 12 lbs over 4 months, feel full most of the time (same as on 15mg) and haven't changed anything dietarily from when I was on 15mg. 

I am asking for your help on what I should do to 

1. Get the weight loss back on track
2. How to best advocate for what I need dosage wise? Should I push to go back to 15? Okay to jump straight back to it? 
3. Any other guidance about why I can't seem to lose any more weight?",1,1739154153.0,Mounjaro,3,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs the short story, I (21 F) was best friends with Ashley (20 F) for 10 years. We met at school and befriended each other at 9-8 and became inseparable. We basically lived at each others houses and had a mutual friend group we always hung out with, went to church together, her family became mine. 
I started questioning everything around 15-17 about the evangelical church and my sexuality, became rebellious, and didn‚Äôt give a shit about what people thought of me I just wanted to be free and unapologetically myself, her on the other hand was more careful of her reputation (that includes what the church thought of her) and got along with majority of authority figures while I had no problem questioning or doubting their ‚Äúexpertise‚Äù. At one point I was a devoted Bible thumper and pretended to pray the biüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà away‚Ä¶.until after I revisited the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and ‚Äúhow comes‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy nots‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt pretend I didn‚Äôt like girls anymore. This made her uncomfortable, at one point she thought I LIKED HER (Respectfully I could never put up with miss prissy, had to get her way, diva‚Ä¶.and she would hate my country music‚Ä¶we‚Äôre like Fire and WaterüòÇüòÖ) 
I‚Äôm surprised we stayed friends for so long but she was my Clair and I was her Serena (gossip girls) opposite‚Äôs attract I guess‚Ä¶
One day I had my insta account logged into her instagram app on her tablet‚Ä¶and I messaged a confession page asking if it‚Äôs ok I, a Christian, stay in choir while I was bi and bla bla bla. Fast forward to MONTHS LATER I was sneaking out with a boy and cutting my hair which is a BIG NO NO in the church‚Ä¶.
Her knowing all this way fine, until she receives a message back from that confession page and reads my confession‚Ä¶.
I get a knock on the door and the pastor walks in and basically him, his wife, and my parents corner me and demand the ‚Äúrumors‚Äù to be put to rest so I must tell the truth, i watered down the truth and I guess I was let off easy. I realized Ashely hasn‚Äôt texted in a week and has been avoiding me, I had a gut feeling and asked her straight up ‚Äúdid you tell everyone I was bi?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt even hesitate and explained everything ‚ÄúI did it cause I love you, I didn‚Äôt know how to handle this‚Äù which I can understand, pressure from the church to be a goody two shoes 24/7 and to make it to heaven will get you to turn on the ones closest to ya.
But she had no right telling my business like that, she could‚Äôve just talked to me??
Anyway, I stopped talking to her for a month and then went back and tried to mend the friendship, basically she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hurt your feelings but I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong‚Äù and my no backbone self just said ok and befriended her again
But we eventually drifted apart and stopped talking again‚Ä¶fast forward a year and a half later we started being civil then slowly started small talk then I popped the question ‚Äúwanna grab coffee sometime?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúyeah, sound good‚Äù 
She‚Äôs like a sister to me, I still love her despite of what happened and I kept my distance and set boundaries but it doesn‚Äôt feel right to not be friends. But I‚Äôm not a church girly anymore and she‚Äôs fully devoted. Idk how well this would mix
And I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing, I recently lost both my grandparents and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt take loved ones for granted‚Ä¶.or maybe I‚Äôm being delulu trying to mend something that shouldn‚Äôt be mended. I don‚Äôt hate her and I never have, but losing her as a friend and her family felt like grief as well. And I guess I wanna talk to her about it??
Got any advice on how to move forward? I tried giving as much context as possible.

I‚Äôve started counseling and he actually followed because he realizes the addiction is messing up our marriage so much.  He sleeps on the couch or another room.  We don‚Äôt have date nights.  He works a lot, manages a big team.  White collar professional, high functioning.  He‚Äôs on his game at work. But I get the complete shaft.  He doesn‚Äôt initiate sex, no intimacy no kissing or passion like nothing.  

This past week actually felt good, his therapy was helping him and he‚Äôs been actively cutting back drinking so as to not go into complete withdrawal symptoms.  It felt less like eggshells.  My therapist told me maybe try asking to grab a coffee together.  So I did that and suggested coffee or brunch on Sat.  We went and it was nice, friendly, just nice to chat.  

I guess I got way ahead of myself.  At Xmas I got a few items from VS and he opened the bag then but nothing.  So i suggested last night let me just try them on and show him with no expectations.  Hes also dismissive avoidant.  So I tried stuff on and showed him and he loved them, no sex or anything but enjoyed seeing them.  But then i noticed he seemed off as in I was sure he‚Äôd been drinking.  I went and watched tv and he fell asleep.  I slept on the couch.  

This morning he noticed I was a bit annoyed and asked what was up.  I told him that his alcoholic side reappeared. He asked if he was yelling.  I said no.  Later I asked if he remembered last night, he said no.  It just deflated me. It‚Äôs not worth my time or effort anymore.  Here I put myself out there last night with the lingerie and he doesn‚Äôt remember. I haven‚Äôt told him but I cant interact anymore after 6pm because I don‚Äôt trust he‚Äôs sober.

1ilv8jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ilv8jj/mr_coffee_2129512_review_compact_coffee_maker/,Mr. Coffee 2129512 Review: Compact Coffee Maker Perfect for Small Spaces,"The Mr. Coffee 2129512, also known as the 5-Cup Mini Brew Switch Coffee Maker, has been part of my daily coffee routine for weeks now, and I must admit, it has made mornings much smoother. As someone who appreciates simplicity in kitchen appliances, this compact coffee maker caught my attention not just for its size but also for its ease of use. It‚Äôs designed to fit snugly into small kitchens, and with its 25-ounce brewing capacity, it‚Äôs perfect for one or two people.

The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its sleek and minimalist design. The matte black finish blends seamlessly with other appliances, and the ergonomic glass carafe‚Äîwith ounce markings‚Äîmakes measuring water super easy. It feels durable yet lightweight, though the carafe itself is somewhat thin, so I take extra care when handling it. The coffee maker‚Äôs compact design means it takes up minimal counter space, which is a win for anyone with a small kitchen like mine.

[Check Mr. Coffee 2129512 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mr-coffee-2129512-review-with-b08qd33pz2-included/)

Operating it is as simple as it gets. There‚Äôs no fancy touchscreen or complicated settings; just an on/off switch with a small indicator light‚Äîa feature I appreciate on groggy mornings. The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause is a lifesaver, allowing me to sneak a quick sip before the brewing cycle finishes. Although it takes about 8 minutes to brew a full pot, the wait is worth it because the coffee tastes great.

**Brewing Performance**  
The consistency of this coffee maker is commendable, especially for its size. I‚Äôve experimented with different coffee grounds, and the results have been reliably flavorful every time. The lack of advanced features like strength or temperature control might seem like a downside for some, but I appreciate the straightforward approach. However, if you‚Äôre someone who enjoys experimenting with brewing strength, this might not be the ideal coffee maker for you.

**Customization & Controls**  
While it doesn‚Äôt offer customizable brewing settings, the simplicity ensures there‚Äôs virtually no learning curve. The carafe markings help me measure just the right amount of water for one or two cups, eliminating guesswork.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning this coffee maker is simple enough. The removable filter basket is a nice touch, though I noticed that standard 10-12 cup filters don‚Äôt fit well‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to use smaller ones designed for 2-5 cup coffee makers. The glass carafe cleans easily, but stains on the lid can become a minor annoyance over time. A quick soak in soapy water usually does the trick, though.

**Capacity & Size**  
One of the standout features is its compact footprint. Measuring just 10.7""D x 9.8""W x 7.2""H, it fits perfectly in my cramped kitchen. The 25-ounce capacity is more than adequate for my daily coffee needs, and it keeps the coffee warm for a surprisingly long time. However, there‚Äôs no auto-shutoff feature, so you‚Äôll need to remember to turn it off manually‚Äîa minor inconvenience but worth noting.

**Pros**

* Compact and space-saving design.
* Easy-to-use on/off switch with indicator.
* Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause feature for mid-brew pours.
* Consistent brewing performance with flavorful results.
* Affordable and practical for single or two-person households.

**Cons**

* No auto-shutoff, which might be a safety concern for some.
* Thin glass carafe requires careful handling.
* Limited to smaller coffee filters, which may not be readily available.
* Lacks customization features like strength and temperature control.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar compact coffee makers like the Black+Decker CM0700B or the Keurig K-Mini, the Mr. Coffee 2129512 holds its own with its simplicity and affordability. The Black+Decker model shares a similar size and price range but feels less sturdy in its build. On the other hand, the Keurig K-Mini offers single-serve brewing and more customization options but at a significantly higher price point, making it less appealing for budget-conscious buyers. The Mr. Coffee model strikes a balance between cost and functionality, making it a reliable option for daily use.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Given the features packed into this coffee maker, it‚Äôs hard to argue with the price point. While it doesn‚Äôt have advanced options, its simplicity and reliability make it well worth the investment. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a no-frills coffee maker that delivers consistent results, the Mr. Coffee 2129512 is a solid choice. Keep an eye out for discounts, as it often goes on sale, making it even more of a steal.

My first impression when meeting him was one of regret. As he approached, my gut continued to sink. After all, I had agreed to meet him outside a coffee shop in an unfamiliar location. He donned a sweater three sizes too big, the hood covering the brim of his eyes. As he reached out to greet me, the tension peaked. My mind raced. Then, he broke the ice with a simple, ""What's up, bro?"" in a thick Turkish accent.

We shook hands and he nonchalantly offered to buy me a coffee‚ÄîI refused. As we waited for his drink, we talked. He told me about where he was from, how long he had been here, and his preferred style of art. I abashedly showed him old tattoos that I hated. He laughed and assured me he could fix them.

Last summer, her family told another mutual friend to come pick up what was left of the yarn and supplies from the shop as well as a large personal stash. It was time to get it out of storage. Several of us began to organize a massive ‚Äúyarn estate sale‚Äù and the profits would go back to her family. 

It took several weekends and about a dozen volunteers to sort, bag, and label everything. One of the volunteers whom didn‚Äôt know this shop owner at all discovered a bag full of yarn that had been set aside with a photo of the intended project. Unfortunately, the pattern was in a now out of print book. Some more digging later the book was found and we all agreed this volunteer needed to take this project. All of the volunteers took home a bit of yarn or some supplies, the shop owner would have wanted it that way. That is how she was. 

Today this volunteer (now another good friend) came to our Sunday coffee session and handed me this giant bag of yarn and the book. She had decided it needed to come back to me.  While she had it, she discovered a couple of skeins were missing, located them somehow (Trendsetter had stopped making the yarn), and added them to the bag. 

All I could do was hug the bag, smile, and say thank you. When I got home I cried...the ugly cry.  When I had met my yarn shop friend I was in a transition point in my life. I‚Äôm currently at another transition point. That bag of yarn felt like a sign everything will be fine.  (I realize this may sound nuts.)

When someone tells you knitting is just a hobby tell them yes, sometimes it is, but sometimes a project will grab us by the heart and could mean everything in the world for a few moments. I‚Äôll cast on this week and think of how fortunate I am to have these friendships in my life. ",21,1739151980.0,knitting,2,1.0,False

1iluwta,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1iluwta/full_veronica_lore_and_backstory_warning_long_read/,Full Veronica lore and backstory. (Warning: Long Read),"Alright, this has been long overdue, it's time I tackled this.

https://preview.redd.it/rb3lsmeov6ie1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2f06319b08b9a11ebc464097afed3e50d97bc0a

Meet Veronica, a 22-year-old monoeye woman who is a top-class espionage spy. She wears a red velvet dress and black low-heel shoes (which aren't shown in the image), long black hair (though it used to be shorter in highschool), and carries a G17 handgun in her left hand, because she's left-handed.

Birthday: 21 August, 2002

Body type: Slim

Eye color: Black

Sexuality: Aroace

Relationship status: Single by choice

Personality: Veronica is serious, mature, occasionally makes sarcastic remarks, and is cunning, yet she's also kind and compassionate, especially to those who are feeling down or need help, but she is also very dangerous when you get on her bad side. If someone tries to attack or mug her, she'll shoot them in the shoulder, and threaten to shoot their head if they don't back off. If someone tries to do some 18+ stuff to her, she shoots them in the reproductive organs.

Veronica prefers to use her gun, but is willing to toss it to the side if she wants to fight melee, and she has melee moves like something straight out of *Karate Kid*. She can also twist somebody's arm to the point of almost breaking it while making sure not to break it, resulting in maximum pain and strain. She typically does this to teenagers that are jerks toward her, since she isn't willing to shoot a child. She would also rather not harm younger children at all. She also loves cats, but doesn't own one herself.

# Backstory

**Chapter 1: Childhood**

[Family photo of their new house.](https://preview.redd.it/5r63nlzjy6ie1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfce61181fdda8593ba9037bd83c5ddd827308d7)

When Veronica was born, her mother was in her late 40s, and they both thought of that day as the best day of their life. When Veronica went to preschool, her mother told her, ""If anyone makes fun of you for the way you look, just tell them that's what makes you unique."" Veronica always had a high self-esteem, and a positive, chipper attitude. At home, her mother would cuddle with her and teach her basic morals, while her father played with her and even helped her with her homework.

They had a healthy family relationship, and Veronica's parents almost never argued, and even then any disagreements they had were worked out in a healthy manner (I feel like I'm making the perfect family here). Whenever her father came home stressed from a tough day at work, his face would light up when he saw his daughter, and would try to play with her despite being tired.

**Chapter 2: Highschool and College**

[Veronica in her junior year.](https://preview.redd.it/vkqbpcnlc7ie1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a0cc5495a6f7c73390e6816984fde5b71f6630)

Veronica's father was always there through elementary and middle school; however, he would not be there for Veronica in highschool. During the summer of 2017, when Veronica turned 14 and was about to start highschool, her father went to drive to work one day, when a drunk driver crashed right into his car, and he either died on impact, or died later in the hospital. When Veronica and her mother found out, they were devastated, since he was a good man to both of them.

Veronica's personality changed after that, though not completely, she still had a good self-esteem, but she was less chipper and positive, and more serious and cold-ish. She still had her compassion and morals, though she would often steal test answer sheets, getting caught only a few times, but not most. She also had to deal with bullies, and decided to take self-defense classes, and later martial arts training, in the 2nd semester of her freshman year. She would often defend anybody being bullied, and bullies knew to not mess with her.

Veronica then went to college at age 18 (by this time, her mother was in her 60s and had to retire), and decided to major in Intelligence Studies. During her 2nd year of college, she decided to grow out her hair, since she felt that short hair didn't fit her anymore.

**Chapter 2A**

One time, during her junior year of highschool, she was using her locker in between classes, when a bully had came up to her, despite the warnings of the other bullies, and started making fun of her to her face, though she didn't care, until he said something bad about her father.

Bully: ""I bet your dad left you because of your eye.""

Veronica got really offended at that statement, and the bully's other bully friends all facepalmed, knowing that he messed up big time, but they were not ready for what Veronica would do next.

Veronica: \*Offended\* ""You take that back.""

Bully: \*Mockingly\* ""Make me.""

Then Veronica pulled out a big metal rod (don't ask why she kept a metal rod in her locker, it's just for this anecdote) and whacked him with it, hard, and he fell down.

Veronica: ""If I was you, I'd listen to your friends back there.""

She was then sent to the principals office for that. (This was before Principal Pony BTW)

**Chapter 3: Early Spy Career**

https://preview.redd.it/6xinigwgl7ie1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffaf9bc209e8e8f6f6eef8163a26657812768d63

During her 3rd year of college, Veronica was approached by this spy, and they gave her the address to a spy agency, which she would have to tell no one about. Veronica had been wanting to be a spy since sophomore year of highschool, which is why she took Intelligence Studies in college. So she went to the place, and was introduced to the boss, who wanted to interview her personally, and then put her into spy training. She passed the interview and eventually passed training, and became a rookie spy, and later an intermediate spy. She then decided to drop out of college to pursue this new career.

**Chapter 4: New Roommate**

[Veronica and Courtney in their apartment together.](https://preview.redd.it/avy3y4x6q7ie1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=2263c75cd65f9f9b281823032bf2dd9d60cb07a2)

Things seemed to be looking up, though her mother was getting really old, and had to be put in a retirement home, so now Veronica, now 20 years old, owned the house, but now she had to deal with the costs of owning a house, and she was making a lot with her spy career, but somehow not enough to maintain the house, so she decided to put it for sale, and then move into the city to live in an apartment, but wasn't sure whether or not to get a roommate.

Veronica sat down at a coffee shop to use its Wi-Fi (BTW, she did order something too) to use her laptop to find an apartment to live in. She initially considered living by herself, but later thought about it financially, and decided that getting a roommate was best. Veronica then sent her online application to a red-headed and blue-eyed florist named Courtney, and decided to meet up with her at the apartment the very next day.

Veronica then showed up at the apartment with the physical application as well, and Courtney opened the door.

Veronica: ""Hey, I'm here to apply to be your new roommate.""

Courtney: ""Oh, hi! You must be Veronica, you actually do have one eye!""

Veronica: ""Yes, yes I do. Anyway, here's the physical application.""

Courtney: ""Alright.""

Veronica then walked in and followed Courtney into the kitchen, who placed the application on the kitchen island to look at later.

Courtney: ""You can take my ex-boyfriend's bedroom!""

Veronica: ""Heh, alright.""

Veronica then brought her things into her new bedroom, and made herself at home.

**Epilogue**

To this day, Veronica, now 22 years old, has been living with Courtney, and the two have become best friends who will always have each others' backs, though Veronica has a greater range to go off of. Veronica has now gone from intermediate to top-class spy, being one of the best spies at the agency, and she earns a much higher pay now. Veronica still visits her mother in the retirement home from time to time, and the two share memories. They still both miss Veronica's father, but they're happy nonetheless. Courtney and Veronica's mother are the only people outside the agency that know Veronica is a spy.

1iluwi8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iluwi8,"I just finished playing PW:AA Trilogy today, with the exact same date in which the last case of the 3rd game ended, February 10th.","Just as the title says...

Ngl, it caught off guard while I was playing. I was too focused and preoccupied on understanding Kurain and the Fey clan's deepest and darkest lore, while also being mesmerized with the fact that how many plot twists does this case even had and how in the world it did made connections to the cases that I've worked on and solved before in the previous two games that I played. I only got to realized it by the time I was about to face off Godot in the final battle with him, when I saw the date and time on the game that is...

Long story short, I finally beat him and finished him off for good with his unreasonable cause for vengeance. But unlike Phoenix, it didn't made me feel great about myself in the end though, even after all what Phoenix had suffered throughout the game, both physical and mental: worrying about the cousins especially Maya, falling a hundred feet into a freezing river of death, hearing harsh and hurtful words from Godot with the 1st degree coffee burns and whips from Franziska and to top it all of that, he still got to defend even though he's still not in good condition.

But man, oh man... I still can't get around but to also feel bad for Godot, he also suffered a lot too in his whole life. Godot, along with his melancholic theme, completely resonates with me, as if I was also in his shoes living as him for a while during my playthrough. I can feel that pain, waking up after so many years, to the scent of coffee, you easily wake up, suddenly conscious about where you are, and what happened. You find out that your hair has now turned snow-white, you can't even see whoever was in front of you.

In an instant you search for the woman you loved, finding out that she'd been long dead 2 years ago... You sit in a chair realizing that your life was over, you don't have anyone on your side, no love, no friends, you've even lost your original identity, you stand up, not with sadness but anger, a burning sense of revenge, you come to the conclusion that the woman you so desperately hated had now been sentenced to death, now restless that you couldn't kill her yourself, and then you find a man, an man that worked under your loved one, Mr. Pheonix Wright, you later find out that he'd seen her, her dead body.

Now a jolt of rage flowing down your veins, that man was with her to the very last second to the point where she died, but continued to live on. You wonder how a human could even continue living, knowing that he killed a woman and you make the final decision. You change your name, the infamous Godot, your green shirt a symbol of your character, you decide to become a prosecutor, to destroy the man that had ruined your life, the man who destroyed her life, you study and study until you are now one of the most respected in the office.

Though you hadn't even prosecuted a case before, and then you see it on the TV. The one moment that started this all, you tighten up your tie and and open up the case summary... and smile,

In school I was stared at and made fun of for simply breathing so maybe my thoughts stem off that. 

I go into public and I‚Äôm not joking when I say the entire room will stop what they‚Äôre doing to stare at me. I can see and feel people out of the corner of my eye turn their heads anytime I walk past. I even walked into Walmart the other day and noticed people staring at me. Two people even dead stopped in their tracks and entirely stopped their conversation to stare me as I walked by and entirely turned their bodies around to just stand there silently staring at me while I walked through the front entrance. Sometimes people laugh. I wish I knew why they were laughing but part of me always thinks they‚Äôre saying mean things. Sometimes people just stare. Most times they come up and talk to me which makes me more overstimulated when I‚Äôm just trying to buy a coffee or get a drink at a bar. It‚Äôs usually compliments about my beauty but the bullying and my own poor self image think they‚Äôre complimenting me to be mean/lie. 

I kept getting followed by men or harassed for a long time so now I don‚Äôt go out alone at all and even when I‚Äôm out with a guy friend men will still come up to me even when I‚Äôm trying to be the most unapproachable person in the world to ask for my number or what have you.

Note that this is for the regular, melatonin free version. I'll mostly be talking about the taste and less about if it helps me sleep or not as it's too early to tell. I'll edit the post in time, though. Before I got into AFK, I read many posts where there was a chalky taste to the flavors and, I also read about milk working better than water with these flavors. I didn't have milk at the time I had this for the first time.

Taste - I mostly taste banana in this, with a tinge of strawberry. It's nice. 

Color - light pink (with water) & milky pink (with milk)

With water... I would not recommend this method. Mind you, this was cold water, 10 oz and was drank in less than 5 minutes. I can't really compare this with the other flavors BUT, I will say that banana flavoring doesn't really jive well with water. Despite liking the taste, I almost gagged because the banana water combo was putting me off a lot. I digress, though. I ended up getting oatmilk the next day.

Oatmilk - I basically used the milk frother on my coffee maker to make sure it fully mixes. This was really helpful, in my experience. I had much better results with this. The creaminess of the milk paired nicely with the banana+strawberry flavor. I think any kind of milk works for this. 

So, overall, it's a good flavor in my opinion. Whenever Banana Propaganda becomes a thing, I'd probably have that with milk too. I do want to try the blueberry lemon cake afk flavor as well. ",9,1739150838.0,gamersupps,3,1.0,False

What‚Äôs that reveal about the me that isn‚Äôt real?  What illusions have I entertained, to stimulate chemicals in my brain?  The specific personalities are not important.  I‚Äôm responsible.  I‚Äôm the jerk who developed a habit for the drug people call love.  Can‚Äôt put it on the dealer.  They‚Äôre just hustling. That‚Äôs what they do. I‚Äôm supposed to be mastering self. Directing magic inwardly.  Visualizing the life I desire for these last few decades of it, God willing.  Where has all my mildly deviant desire gone?  I‚Äôve been known to get more than a little weird, but it isn‚Äôt a lifestyle, and why do I feel like I need to evoke it?  To conjure some inner swinger, lol.  I can‚Äôt keep up with what‚Äôs been recently revealed thru my ancestors, and guides, nor would I ever be inclined to pursue such infernal extremes.  Would I? That requires a little shadow exploration, and yea, nah Im good.  Old school, old man, a book, and a cardigan, cup of tea. That‚Äôs me.  Cool romance, subtle seduction with true hearts.  I won‚Äôt go into gory details about the alternative. No judgement.  How did I fail to recognize Op‚Äôs that I allowed in my house?  For some reason I attract demon driven deceivers, so easily triggered by what the Good Lord only knows.  Something about me irritates these creeps, and inspires to conspire.  It‚Äôs happened a few times, now. Little less heartbreaking every time, and after this time I don‚Äôt think it can ever be broken again. It will not close, however. That‚Äôs my gift. Part of the power bestowed upon me by the Most High.  And, now I hear, and heed a call to honor it with service.  Still hard to believe. Why me? I‚Äôm a professional fuck up, and not exactly temperate, or chaste.  I always thought I was lustful, until I met these people. So it goes. Life is strange.

It's always been me pursuing the woman, but like, respectfully of course (always take no for an answer, never try to push for anything). I have mad social anxiety and this basically already handicaps me in the dating world haha - but that's beside the point. Though recently, I've honestly just started embracing being single. Me and my ex broke up about a year ago (my idea) - it was one of the toughest decisions I've ever had to make, but I just had to admit I wasn't emotionally available for her. She always talked about how she felt drained being with me, so I decided it was best for both of us if we stepped away.

Now I've tried dating here and there since, but it never felt right or it just wasn't the right person, so I gracefully ended things. But again, it was me pursuing them. NOW I have the opposite problem... two women who want me when I don't want them! Never in a million years would I EVER thought I'd be in this situation, but when it rains it pours I guess!

The kicker is they're both coworkers of mine and I have made a conscious effort to not date at work after blowing up in my face with another coworker about \~8 years ago, but even if they weren't coworkers, I'm just not interested. We have nothing in common with each other and I've been filling the emptiness in my life with other hobbies I enjoy doing rather than date. But goddamn, they just can't seem to take a hint. One day my one coworker saw me eating a salad at lunch, and then later in the evening drunk texted me saying she loved my salad and that she'd love to ""toss it around for me."" Like dude wtf! I did get a kick out of it admittedly, but I have told her I'm not looking to date right now. Like don't get me wrong, I love humor like that but she's so pushy with it that it just turns me off completely.

And then out of nowhere, the other coworker mentions that she's in her mid-30s and that her fertility window is closing and that I'd make a ""great father"" which was just- instant ICK! I have no idea if she was implying something or not but OMG gross, I hate even thinking about it! I do not ever want children and I've already taken the proper steps to prevent that, but Jesus Christ that was like the icing on the cake and made instantly just want to hide in the basement at work the rest of the day. This particular woman has already asked me out, I politely declined, and now she keeps pushing for us to ""get coffee."" I've already said I didn't want to but she'll just keep pushing and pushing and pushing, so now I always have ""something"" going on over the weekends/after work that requires my fullest attention haha.

I was talking to my step-mom about all this that's been happening to me, and she was very sympathetic, told me how to approach HR, etc. but then mentioned her having these experiences as a woman, but with guys who just keep pursuing and pursing and I thought about how exhausted my experience was with only two. Like, I always *knew* women had to put up with a lot, but it was like I am just now *realizing* what it feels like.

This is a bizarre experience and while I'm certainly looking at the silver lining and reaping the benefits of knowing that there are people out there attracted to me, at the same time it's like, I'm exhausted telling these people No all the time! I don't even engage now, I wear ear buds and pretend to be focused on work. I used to be open about where I go after work, but now I never say anything because I'm genuinely concerned they might ""bump into"" me at the gym/park/etc.

Women - I am sincerely sorry for all the shit you all go through! And I'm sorry I never understood until it happened to me!

It was genius‚Äîcutting-edge AI, groundbreaking promises, and a mission to ‚Äúdisrupt‚Äù something. Six months later, I‚Äôm watching reruns of my favorite sitcom wondering what went wrong. The twist? AI killed my startup. Or maybe it was a slow, agonizing demise aided by a steroided, robotic hand.

Welcome to the age where AI isn‚Äôt just the tool in your entrepreneur toolkit; it‚Äôs the Godzilla that decimates your scrappy little professional Tokyo. Take DeepSeek, the Chinese tech prodigy that claimed it built an AI model matching, if not surpassing, the American darling ChatGPT. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîit did this with a budget that would barely buy you a decent piece of Silicon Valley real estate. Feat or fiction, it‚Äôs a headache Washington didn‚Äôt see coming, or rather, refused to see as it desperately tried to contain China with sanctions that have been about as effective as a paper umbrella in a downpour.

**The Great AI Tug-of-War**

Imagine the Cold War, but instead of missiles, we‚Äôre slinging algorithms, and instead of trench coats, it‚Äôs all about the most strategic application of hoodie engineering resources. DeepSeek‚Äôs accomplishments have sparked whispers of an AI Sputnik, a potentially game-changing leap that could alter the balance of digital power forever. Washington‚Äôs attempts to stifle China‚Äôs tech advancements are as futile as trying to discipline an overcaffeinated ferret. China's sheer scale‚Äîover a billion data-producing people and a surveillance system that probably tracks thoughts‚Äîmeans it's RiZen to become the AI superpower. It doesn‚Äôt matter if DeepSeek‚Äôs core inspiration was a ChatGPT doppelg√§nger or not‚Äîperception is everything in the tech race.

**The All-Seeing AI Eye**

China‚Äôs trifecta of AI titans‚ÄîBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent‚Äîare like Hogwarts for data wizards, fueled by the country's vast population creating vast oceans of real-time surveillance data. This resource might well be the digital version of Excalibur, cutting through competition with ease and throwing shade at America's tech hegemony. Such capabilities beg the question: When your surveillance network rivals Santa's naughty and nice list, who needs cutting-edge chips when you can manufacture all the know-how with this dynamic data discipline?

**AI: Frenemy of the Future**

Does all this mean Nvidia should pack its bags, or does the arrival of China‚Äôs affordable DeepSeek suggest a world where AI becomes as common as your twice-daily coffee fix? It‚Äôs uncertain but enthralling to think about.

The discussion is red-hot and far from over. Grab your popcorn while AI lines up to either crash your dreams or catapult you to stardom‚Äîor both. The gears of innovation (and destruction) keep turning.

You may just make a small message on here or replay with a 'god is with you.' or 'god loves you.' something I needed to be beaten into me.  Someone might just be happy to come across it. Someone you don't know. Spread a little light, one small thing could make someone's day.  God loves you.",2,1739149798.0,god,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the new age, folks‚Äîa time when artificial intelligence isn't just knocking at our doors but is also expertly kicking them open. I've heard every genius and their speech-generating machine raving about AI's potential to revolutionize industries and birth a fresh batch of million-dollar startups. But let's be honest, for every startup AI births, it seems to murder a handful, leaving a trail of dashed dreams and empty coffee cups.

**The Rising Empire of DeepSeek**  
Enter China‚Äôs DeepSeek, the latest AI powerhouse stirring a media frenzy akin to a Kardashian wedding. DeepSeek‚Äôs generative AI claims to match ChatGPT in performance and outpace it in cost efficiency. But here's the real kicker: it was allegedly developed with a fraction of the resources the Western moguls burned through. It's almost like someone handed DeepSeek the recipe for Big Tech's secret sauce, and they cooked it up on a budget.

**Provoke, Debate, and (Maybe) Panic**  
Talks of this being a new ""Sputnik moment"" are spreading‚Äîreminders of a time when space races translated to decades of geopolitical arm-wrestling. But unlike the Cold War‚Äôs slow and steady crescendo, we're now dealing with rapidly evolving technology that doesn‚Äôt afford us the luxury of time. If AI is the new battlefield, it's less trench warfare and more like a chess game played on fast-forward with an unpredictable AI opponent.

**The US in the Mirror: Heavy-Handed Tactics?**  
Washington's current strategy reeks of an action movie where the hero believes brute force holds all the answers. Sanctions and tech restrictions‚Äîit's all very ""Die Hard,"" but if AI's shown us anything, it's this: adaptability outlasts stubbornness. History (and AI) tells us that tech savvy and cooperation often win over isolation and brute force.

**Data: The Golden Goose of AI**  
China stands unmatched in data acquisition, thanks to its colossal population and state surveillance systems straight out of a dystopian novel. Its tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are sitting on a big data gold mine, training their AI models with relentless rigor. It‚Äôs a little like training for an AI Olympics‚Äîif Olympic events were fueled by sheer data firepower and a hearty dose of surveillance.

**So, Who Actually Wins in this AI Showdown?**  
As the AI race heats up, the question isn't just about who makes the most advanced models but who plays the smartest strategic game. We need to talk about international cooperation, governance, and yes, possibly some friendly competition too.

Let‚Äôs take a stroll down Inevitability Avenue, where an AI takeover looms not as a sci-fi dystopia but as an unsettling reality we're already grappling with. Amnesty International‚Äôs tech wizard Damini Satija has thrown down the gauntlet at the AI Action Summit in Paris. The mission? To steer the tech titans and global leaders away from distraction by pixie dust‚Äîaka, corporate interests‚Äîand focus on laying down the law for AI.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

### The Stakes Are High
AI isn‚Äôt just theorizing about your job‚Äîit‚Äôs learning your coffee order while rewriting its own laws. As governments and tech execs gather round the Parisian round table, Satija says this summit is a crucial moment to snag meaningful AI regulation. It‚Äôs a little like taming a dragon with a fondness for chaos: irresistible yet painfully necessary.

### Voices of the Many
Diversity is essential, but apparently, no one sent the memo. According to Amnesty, impacted communities and human rights advocates, specifically those from the Global Majority, have been sidelined. The summit‚Äôs lack of generous visa allocations screams more ‚Äúexclusivity club‚Äù than ‚Äúglobal solution.‚Äù

### Regulation vs. Innovation
Ah, the eternal tug-of-war. Big Tech plays the ‚Äúregulation stifles innovation‚Äù card like it‚Äôs an ace, but Amnesty calls for vigilance. Don't let the flashy new toys distract us; there‚Äôs a pileup of human rights issues rolling out with AI tech that needs serious policing.

### The Bigger Picture
AI‚Äôs scope isn‚Äôt just the software‚Äîinjustice has woven itself through supply chains, exploitation, and environmental devastation like a messy electronic signature. We‚Äôre standing on the precipice, and ignoring it isn‚Äôt going to make the cliff any less steep.

Damini Satija's declaration at the summit is a clarion call. AI is not lurking in the shadows‚Äîit's at the forefront, asking us to either rise to the challenge or have a front-row seat to our swan song. The question is, will our leaders listen, or will AI continue to masquerade as its own judge and jury?

1ilu9bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ilu9bs/hf_tales_from_r/,[HF] Tales from R.,"1.

In my younger years, I lived in Charlottesville, the old haunt of Mr. Poe, not half a mile from the same Ragged Mountain made famous by his writing. Mr. Poe only attended the University foryear or so, his stay mostly remarkable for his lack of actual attendance of lectures and the copious ingestion of alcohol and other intoxicants for which he is still infamous and, I might add, revered and emulated by many undergraduates. Despite his brief stay, Mr. Poe is regarded as one of the University's luminaries even though, as usual, that only came about many years later after he became famous. At the time, he was hardly noticed, but today you can't go on a tour or enter a bookstore without hearing some tale of Mr. Poe's association with the school or seeing some likeness of a raven.

Ragged Mountain is, as he described it, a low range of desolate hills which are located Southwest of town and trail off in that direction into Nelson County. I have rambled all over those hills with an eye out for the hidden gorge described by Mr. Bledso but, after 10 years, had never seen a trace nor heard the bark of a hyena. Now, decades later, the area is fenced, cross-fenced, and gentrified into yet another suburban enclave of ""farms"" and ""country estates"" affordable for the professional class.

I came to Charlottesville after a short residence in South Florida at the height of the pot smuggling era and the beginning of the time of the cocaine cowboys. Part of my reason for leaving was education but another was to get out of the trade as it was becoming increasingly crazy and violent. I was told by some of the old hands that the average lifespan of the low level dealer was about a year until he's was either busted, turned, jailed, shot, or some combination of the above. At each level of the food chain, the chance of ascension was about the same as a high school footballer being drafted to play for Manchester City. Most of the guys at level above me had already done their term of advanced study, courtesy of the state, at Stark or Perry. It was not a very promising prospect. So, I bailed.

Imagine my surprise when, one morning several years later, a knock on the door interrupted my coffee and perusal of the Daily Progress. There, in the grey drizzle, stood R., a famous - or infamous - Florida dealer, a rock star of the trade indeed. He was widely known nationally as a professional surfer when those were as rare as hen's teeth. He had the sponsors, the magazine covers, and the wahines to prove it. But, he also had a taste for cocaine which would later be the end of his teeth, nasal septum, and career. That, however, lay a few years into the future.

‚ÄúDamn, R, what a surprise! Come in out of the rain.‚Äù The last time I saw him was two years before, sitting on a bale of Jamaican, calmly picking out the buds. I hadn't spoken to him since then I struggled to think if there was some reason he was here. Did I owe some money? Had some deal gone sideways? Was it about his sister, my one time lover? ‚ÄúCan I get you some coffee?‚Äù

R. stood at the kitchen door drinking from his mug, looking out over the front yard and to the hills beyond shrouded in grey mist. He proceeded to tell me the strange tale of how he ended up in my kitchen.

2.

‚ÄúThe whole story begins with that last deal we did together, you know, going down to get the load off that trawler and delivering it up to Satellite. You remember? After you left, I moved back to Miami. I had a nice little import business going, not too big but enough to put some money away.

I thought I was staying under the radar. I did an occasional deal with the same crew and laid off the product with our old pal Micky up in Cocoa. Mostly, I was working so I could make enough money to be able to stay in PR or Mex for the winter.

Miguel, the captain, decided that he was not going to run pot from Jamaica anymore. The island was more and more being used as a distribution hub for cocaine and heroin to Houston, New Orleans, Florida, and the East Coast. It made little sense to fill his boat with bales when he could fill it with bricks and make ten times the money for a single run. He told me I could get a special price if the Jamaicans agreed. He didn't think that would be a problem since we had done a number of deals over the years. So, he arranged a meeting on Cat Island.

‚ÄúThe next week, he picked me up in Miami one evening and, after an overnight passage, we were off French Bay the next morning. We motored the skiff around the point and tied up at a new dock where there was a new hotel under construction.

‚ÄúWe walked into a partially finished building and met 4 of these guys sitting around a table strewn with architectural plans. One was a fellow who often accompanied Miguel into Miami. I had met him before. Two others also had dreads and the third was a Latin guy in a suit but no tie. He said not a word the whole time we were there. The proposal was simple. They would bring the product in and I was responsible for picking it up COD and laying off a certain amount every two weeks. They knew my name. They knew where I lived - even that I had moved to a different apartment 10 days ago. They knew my bank. They knew where my parents and my sister lived.

‚ÄúThey even knew a number of my buyers and associates over the years including your old housemate Rick, Micky, and you. No threats were made but I was told that I would pay every two weeks the agreed amount even if I didn't even take delivery. The price point was very good and the initial volume was manageable - pretty close to what I was doing anyway. I'm sure they knew that.

‚ÄúThe main problem was that this arrangement would interfere with my surf trips. I was even planning to go to Hawaii that winter. The apparent head guy dismissed it.

""You got to grow up, mon. With this deal, you make enough to commute to Hawaii.

""I agreed, as long as the deliveries were handled by Miguel or one of the Jamaicans I had met. The guy in the suit then pulled out a case and opened it up revealing about 8 keys of coke and a single brick of Mexican H. I told them I didn't sell that stuff and wasn't sure if I could move it. John, the guy I who worked with Miguel, said I'd see. It would be no problem. Anyway, this half key was a gift to seal our partnership. I was supposed to see them in 1 week on Marco Island with the cash.

‚ÄúThe return trip was uneventful. I spent the next 2 days trying to round up the cash and ended up using a chunk of the money I had saved for my winter on the North Shore. I made it to the yacht harbor on Marco Island at dusk and Miguel and John met me there in a new Contender. I handed over the money and turned to leave.

‚ÄúNo, se√±or, Miguel said. Let's take a ride.‚Äú

‚ÄúWe got in the boat and rode South toward Chokoloskee. The wind was dead calm and the water was plate glass as the moon rose over the Thousand Islands. After about an hour, I spotted an unlit trawler in the moonlight and we pulled alongside. There were 3-4 people on board and one guy on the top of the pilothouse with a rifle. A Jamaican guy got on board the Contender. We headed East into the mangrove channels at good speed. There was a campfire on one of the islands and we made a bead for it.

‚ÄúYou know Santeria? It's Cuban or something. In Haiti, they got voodoo. These Jamaicans had some other fucked up religion which involves speaking some pidgin, fire, ganga, and sacrifices. They had a couple of chickens gutted and were soaking feathers in blood, throwing them in the fire, and other such shit. I stood there looking stupid until one of the guys grabbed both my arms and held me. I turned to him and said hey and he just cracked a grin. As I turned back to the fire, another pressed a big ass blade against my throat, all bloody and sticky with chicken guts.

‚ÄúThis older guy with long dreads picks up some feathers and smears my cheek with blood, muttering some shit. He smiled with his gold teeth glinting in the fire and said now he knew he could trust me. You do what I say and you will be protected by Obi.

‚ÄúThey let me go and handed me a fat spliff they had been passing around. I was shaking like a leaf. The old Jamaican seemed to be the leader or chief or priest or whatever. The others kept their distance.

‚ÄúHe pulled out a snuff box and motioned me over. He opened it and took a snort with a little spoon. I thought great, I could use a little bump. It's about time I tried some of this coke. I took one snort and it was just like acid or fire in my nose. I sneezed, coughed, gagged and threw up, as all those freaks were laughing like hyenas. Then I began to get weird sensations like the sparks from the fire left trails as they went up in the air, the crickets seemed so loud, but I couldn't hear or understand what people were saying. I felt dizzy and sat down, leaning back against this palm trunk and kinda passed out.

3

‚ÄúI woke up in the early morning with fucking fire ants biting my foot. I was laying on the beach next to the smoldering fire and those burnt chicken carcasses. They were covered with ants. It was foggy, cold, and wet. I couldn't see shit. No one else was around. I looked out toward the bay and could barely see the water's edge. I stirred up the fire but it was all wet and that just put it out. I figured I'd wait for the sun to come and burn the fog off. After an hour or so, I don't know how long, the fog was a bit thinner but I still didn't see any boats.

‚ÄùThere was a sand track like some old road leading off the beach where I had slept which curved East up into the mangroves. I was tired of slapping mosquitoes so after waiting a while I started walking. Not too far up the road I came to a ruined fish camp. Just a falling down shack, a rotten pier and some pilings in the bank of a canal. In the fog, it looked like it was a thousand years old. The road continued on until I came to some rusty seemingly abandoned trailers, doors gone or swinging open. I heard a dog bark up ahead in the fog. I walked into some sort of town - a few more forgotten trailers, a couple of shacks with no windows, and a ramshackle store.

‚ÄúMy stomach was still fucked up. I walked into the store. A naked bulb hung in the room. I called out but no one was around. There was an old rusty Coke ice chest. I opened it and saw a couple of those old Coke bottles submerged in rusty warm water. What were they? Six ounces? Anyway, I got a room temperature bottle of Coke which almost made me puke again and brought the trails and the noise in my ears back. I sat down on the steps and must have passed out for a couple of hours.

‚ÄúI dreamed I was up on some hill looking down on a town. It looked hot and dusty down there but up on the hill it was cool. I could see people down there, moving about like ants far below. Then, gradually, it seemed like face after face turned in my direction until the whole town seemed to be looking up the hill at me. A group of people set out from the town toward me and more joined them as they walked. I turned around to see what they were looking at but there was nothing onthe hill. When I turned back, the throng was twice the size and some of them were carrying sticks or spears. As they came closer, I realized that those I had taken for women were men with long hair and dreads. I thought I better get out of there so I turned back and took off.

‚ÄúI woke up swatting mosquitoes again. My ears were clear and I could hear again. I felt better so I kept walking down the road until I hit some pavement. I walked West as the sun finally came out. I flagged down this Seminole in an old Ford and bummed a ride back to civilization. He asked where I came from. I told him I was partying on an island and was left by my friends thenwalked to the road. He looked at me out of the corner of his eye.

""You must have duck feet. There's nothing but swamp on that side.

""I told him about the rundown town on dirt road but he said there's no road. He pointed to the canal which ran along the highway which I could see stretching straight as an arrow in both directions. I couldn't see the sand road. Weird. I hopped into the cab and he drove me back to Naples.

‚ÄúWhen I got back to Miami, I found some fucking chicken feathers on my kitchen counter. I called my sister but couldn't reach her.

‚ÄúPam?

‚ÄúYeah. He looked sideways at me. She asks about you sometimes. I finally got in touch with her girlfriend and she told me that Pam had gone to Jamaica for a week and was at some resort! I was going to lay low but then I realized I had another shipment in 8-9 days and had to come up with the money or who knows what those psychos would do. What's worse is I keep having the dream where I'm running from a crowd of Jamaicans.

‚ÄúDon't you have any whiskey to put in this coffee?, he said as he handed me the mug.

4

I started heating up the coffee and making some eggs and toast. I got R a new cup with a splash of Paddys.

‚ÄúWhat was that shit? Sounds like ackee, Jimson weed, or some other such poison.

‚ÄúJohn said it was some herb - I didn't recognize the name - and ground up human bones.

‚ÄúYou're shitting me. That's whacked.

‚ÄúYeah, I've found that whole crew is seriously crazy - probably from snorting that.

‚ÄúI hope you don't expect me to come up with money. I'm a poor medical student now just getting by on part-time work and my wife's job.

‚ÄúThe money's no problem for now. When I got back to Miami, I took stock and found I had cleared enough to pay for the next 3 deliveries almost. I decided to focus on a select few buyers so I could dispose of the product rapidly. I gave them a good price so they were making money. Soon, I was basically doing a delivery service for the coke to Miami and up coast. The problem was that brown Mexican shit. The Jamaicans likely had a higher profit on that and pushed more and more of iton me. For a while, I was able to get rid of it to Rob.

‚ÄúRob? - who lived on the Venetian Isles?

‚ÄúYeah.

‚ÄúSeriously, I thought he was a pilot for some airline. I haven't seen him forever.

‚ÄúWell, he had some commercial gig, but I think he made more dealing. I didn't know him as well as you.

‚ÄúWhich was not very well.

‚ÄúAnyway, he didn't want any more than 4 keys at a time so soon I had a problem. Plus, one of my buyers from Savannah went to jail. I can't sell any more without risk. So here I am.

‚ÄúShit, R, you're like the rat on the wheel.

‚ÄùYah.

‚ÄúHmm. I could introduce you to Jim in Norfolk who still deals but he's flaky. I can't help you much there as I'm out of the trade.

‚ÄúThat's where I'd like to be.

‚ÄúWell, you could get yourself busted for some minor possession charge, do a few months, and then they likely wouldn‚Äôt want to deal with you after.

‚ÄúPretty thin.

‚ÄúOr, move to Indo.

‚ÄúI was thinking Tahiti or Samoa.

‚ÄúGood luck. Don't tell Pam. So how did you find me?

‚ÄùI asked John. I was on my way up to DC so I thought I would drop by.

‚ÄúWell, I'm not hiding and I'm in the phone book so I guess I could be found, but still it's a little disconcerting. Still if I can help you I could try to come up with some names.

But now I had no intention of giving him any other names. Who knows, maybe he had been busted and was trying to set people up for the cops. Maybe I would just be throwing those poor sods under the bus, either to the cops or, maybe worse, to be menaced by some fucking Obi wannabe priest. Now, I just wanted to get him to move on.

 We had a bit of breakfast and I called Jim, my acquaintance in Norfolk, telling him to expect a visit from R. We said goodbye and R. said he would drop by on the way back to meet my wife. But I never saw him again.

I heard from Jim that he met R. and they did a few deals. Jim met the Jamaicans too and they started bringing drugs into Norfolk directly. Ballsy as hell. I had almost shit myself when we went down to the Miami River docks and unloaded a trawler in clear sight of the federal building. But now these guys were running boats full of cocaine and heroin right past the entire Atlantic Fleet and up the Elizabeth River.

Jim was busted two years later. Ultimately, he died of a heart attack at age 50. I always wondered if coke mixed with Jamaican hoodoo dust was to blame. R. didn't show on the return trip. I later heard from one of my Florida friends that he was still in Miami, a bit of a hopeless addict who had lost his back teeth and had a hole in his nasal septum from snorting some shit.

Since I live in Florida now, I see Jamaicans all the time, some guy with dreads out of the corner of my eye, some sound man for a reggae band scanning the crowd at the bar, but maybe not those Jamaicans. Who knows?",1,1739149430.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1ilu89q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ilu89q/i_saw_something_that_my_boyfriend_never_meant_for/,I saw something that my boyfriend never meant for me to see. Help me.,"Before she died, my mother dispensed idioms with the mechanical consistency of a gumball machine. She offered them like pieces of stale wisdom; their minimal flavor quickly faded. Even so, I found myself savoring them. I didn‚Äôt want to relinquish the last sentiments she had to give me. 

‚ÄúWatched pots never boil, Mary.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo birds, one stone.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney catches more flies than vinegar.‚Äù 

At first, it was easy to pretend that the idioms were relevant to our conversations.  But as she lost lucidity, they melded together and became unintelligible.

‚ÄúThrow the baby out with the gift horse.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to bury the elephant in the room, Mary.‚Äù

I used to sit next to her in the nursing home and will myself to understand. Her tone was always urgent, her grasp fervent. She looked at me like she was begging me to comprehend nonsense. But even then, I suppose I knew what she was really telling me without voicing it. Words that I would not bear to hear even if she were capable of saying them.

She was dying.

Her jumbled idioms seemed to be all that remained of a once expansive vocabulary. She used to weave stories with language like a beautiful thread and her tongue as a needle. But, It was as if she forgot how to sew. I imagined her dementia burrowing into her brain, chiseling out words, leaving only rot in its wake. 

When her disease first manifested, I deluded myself. I became convinced I could slow her decline with the right materials. I brought her daily newspapers until the incident happened.

That day, I gave her the daily paper and a quick kiss on the cheek. I sank down in the stiff armchair at her bedside and shielded my eyes from the sunlight that streamed in from the window. I glanced at her venous hands and saw them tremble. The paper shook with her convulsions. I felt every muscle in my body tense as she emitted a low, warbling moan. 

‚ÄúMom, what is it?‚Äù I asked. 

But her only response was to curl further in on herself. She clutched her ancient nightgown to her chest like a small child. My heart clenched. Terrified and confused, I reached out to comfort her, to take the paper away, but she broke down sobbing.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry over book covers,‚Äù she whimpered.

When I finally wrestled the tear-sodden paper away from her, I read the headline,

‚ÄúJENKINS TWINS SUSPECTED TO BE 6TH AND 7TH VICTIMS OF BACKWOODS BUTCHER‚Äù 

After that, I only brought Debbie McComber novels. But the damage was done; she stopped reading not long after the newspaper incident. 

I watched the seasons change from her room‚Äôs window. As the trees shed their leaves, resplendent shades of crisp golds and browns were carried away by the wind. As far as the eye could see, the trees‚Äô skeleton limbs were left to brace the cold. Without their armor, they looked defenseless and alone.

My mother lost herself in much the same way.

Day by day, the color bled from her life; her essence shed from her skin like so many dead leaves. In its absence, she was carved bare ‚Äì until only a dull, unrecognizable hull remained.

I tried to search her face for any semblance of selfhood, but her skeleton leered as if mortality were staking its claim. Flesh clung to her jaw and hung in jowls like the last vestiges of life clung to her frame. She was my mother, and she was death incarnate. 

I found that I could not look at her for long. I stared hard at the floor, my hands, the door. Anywhere but the unfamiliar gaze from the sockets sunken in my mother‚Äôs face.

When she sensed that my gaze had shamefully slid away, she sometimes snarled at me.

‚ÄúWatched pots never boil!‚Äù 

Her frail fingers would dig into my wrist and leave imprints in my skin. I could feel her urging me to look at her, to see her diseased eyes and wispy hair and pallor skin. 

This is my confession, so I can admit: it was hard to visit her in the end. 

I found excuses to leave as early as I could, or better yet, to never come. I hated the twisted, repetitive idioms that she upheaved like a sickness. I hated the bleached smell of the nursing home. Most of all, I hated sitting next to her as an unseen but pernicious force took more and more of her away. 

I knew she was dying. For months, I could see it etched in her face and hear it in the absence of things she couldn‚Äôt say. But then why was I left so bereft when Death came like a thief in the night? I should have been relieved for her suffering to end. But all I could hear were the last words she said as they bounced around in my head.

‚ÄúMary,‚Äù she uttered, two days before her end, ‚Äúbetter late than never.‚Äù 

 I didn‚Äôt hear her speak again until long after she was dead.

Her funeral came and went with little fanfare. A few of my friends came from work; most of hers were already dead. Together, we listened as a pastor we had never met described a caring Creator we had never perceived. When the time came, I sprinkled dirt on her casket and watched as the gaping maw of the Earth swallowed her whole.

Afterward,  Ethan, Jade, Allison, Sam, Nick, and I all crowded around a small bonfire as February‚Äôs cold sank her teeth in our skin. I drank more than I spoke. My friends carried the conversation. When it was time for the rest to leave, Ethan didn‚Äôt. I sank into his arms that night, and every night since. 

One week passed without my mother‚Äôs idioms, then two, then three. Several months came and went. When it rained, it was a pet-free downpour. I judged books by their covers and stared at pots just long enough for them to boil. I don‚Äôt know why. I just know that I felt her absence acutely. So much so that the lack of her became its own presence.

 My mother met an end she didn‚Äôt deserve, and I couldn‚Äôt find the justice in it. How was it fair for her to die alone in a nursing home, left with nothing but the few sentences she could string together, wilted flowers, and a book she could no longer read? Horribly, unforgivably: how was it fair that she became a burden to me, and I resented her for it? I hated sitting there, listening to her half of conversations decades in the past, a prisoner of her own mind, only ever lucid enough to hate me. Sometimes the grief rose and fell in crests and waves, and other times the anger ignited me.

When I was angry, I would go home and set a full pot on a hot burner and wait. Just like I used to sit and wait at the nursing home for her to say anything, do anything. I was good at passive participation. I sat and watched as time elapsed and bled the life from her eyes and the love from her heart. So I did it, too, with the pots.

I wish I could say I watched the water boil because I missed her, but I think the truth is that I was daring her. My own vengeful version of ‚Äúlook, mom, no hands‚Äù: a desperate, illogical call for her attention. But in all the times I called for her across a depthless void, I never actually expected her to answer.

But she did. 

I first heard her words from Ethan‚Äôs lips after the fire. 

I guess I left the burner on for so long and so often that I became careless. Maybe I forgot to turn it off one night after I emptied the pot of boiling water. All I know is that my house went up in flames and little was left, save for ashes.

After I lost everything, I was so relieved when Ethan invited me to stay with him. Of course, I said yes. He had a charming bungalow out in the country on land his grandfather left him. Our casual fling quickly became a serious relationship. He brewed tea almost every night, and always prepared mine with plenty of honey. As my mother would say, living with Ethan was a silver lining. 

Or that‚Äôs how it felt until she decided to join us. 

Two weeks ago, my mother spoke to me. But, I didn‚Äôt know it at the time. As Ethan set my mug down on the coffee table, I looked into his deep blue eyes.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHey, do you mind grabbing a blanket?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, love,‚Äù he brushed a curl behind my ear and walked to the doorway before suddenly turning back. He stood there in the doorway for a few minutes, unmoving, as if in a trance.

I felt his eyes on me and raised mine only to meet his vacant stare. He was looking through me. His brow was furrowed.

‚ÄúI thought I told you watched pots never boil.‚Äù 

The voice that left his lips was not his. Nor was it hers, not really. It was something else ‚Äì inhuman. A death-rattle wheeze that formed the shape of words in the absence of inflection. I did not hear it so much as I felt it ‚Äì a chill that twirled around my spine and tightened. I felt this entity and instantly became clammy and nauseous.

I could not speak. My mouth was filled with ashes.

‚ÄúHoney, are you okay? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost!‚Äù Ethan came out of it, crouched before me, and gently reached for my hands.

Finally, my throat unclogged and words spilled out. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Why did you say ""watched pots never boil?‚Äù I said. I searched his gaze but only saw our shared confusion.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything. Are you sure you‚Äôre feeling okay?‚Äù He inspected me with concern. 

I both believed him and didn‚Äôt. I knew that those words couldn‚Äôt be his, but then why did they leave his lips? 

At first, nothing came of it. I wish I could say that this was the end of it. But it was only the beginning.

That voice‚Ä¶ I heard that voice more times than I care to admit. The words were always my mothers‚Äô but the voice was not of this earth. It was devoid of humanity. It lacked light, love, or warmth. 

At times, I believed that my mother was speaking to me across a great distance and maybe the bone-chilling voice was interference. 

Other times, I was convinced that Ethan was pranking me. It was easier and safer to think my boyfriend was an asshole than it was to think we were being haunted by my mother. But even then, I could not shake my terror. Every day, just as my defenses lowered, that nauseating voice would surface from the grave of his lips and permeate the air. 

Hours ago, it said, ‚Äútwo birds, one stone, two birds, one stone, two birds, one stone, two birds, one stone, two birds, one stone.‚Äù 

It was a chant and it was a condemnation. I could not hear the anger but I could feel it suffusing the words and contaminating our home.

‚ÄúEthan, what the fuck is going on with you?‚Äù I pushed him in the chest and was shocked as his head cracked back against the wall. It was like his body went lax. Like his form was hollow and the voice was an abscess. 

‚ÄúLet her off the hook,‚Äù The words were carried by a rapid hiss from between his cracked lips. 

I shuddered as the temperature plummeted. 

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I choked out. 

I could feel the shift as Ethan returned to his senses. He rubbed his head.

‚ÄúMary, what happened? Why are you looking at me like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúEthan, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt funny. You need to stop.‚Äù I pleaded. 

‚ÄúMary, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. My head is pounding. I‚Äôm going to lay down for a minute. Okay?‚Äù

Flabbergasted, I watched as he walked away and shook off the urge to beg him to stay with me. I wanted, no, needed to get to the bottom of the voice. If my boyfriend had a shitty sense of humor, then okay. But, we would talk about it like adults. Things had gone too far. So, I went in search of Tylenol for his headache. Like my mother always said, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. 

I searched high and low in cabinets and drawers and turned up empty. It seemed like I found everything but Tylenol. I was almost ready to give up, but then I remembered his guest bathroom cabinet. 

I felt around inside a drawer when my fingers brushed against two thin metal chains. I pulled them out and held them up to the light.

They were curious things. Two thin strands, each with a single bird charm dangling. They looked familiar in a way I couldn‚Äôt place. Did Ethan have family stay in this room? His mom or sisters?

 As I studied them, my heart began to race.

‚ÄúTwo birds, one stone.‚Äù 

Surely, that was a coincidence. I wanted to put them back in the drawer, close it, and forget about it. But even as I thought it, I felt a compulsion to keep them. Some unknown instinct was nudging me almost imperceptibly. 

The necklaces looked so innocent. The type of jewelry that children wear. With sudden clarity, I knew where I had seen them before.

Of almost its own volition, I felt my hand reach for my phone in my pocket. I pulled it out, unlocked it, and stared at the home screen, unblinking. I typed into the Google bar, ‚ÄúJenkins twins disappeared.‚Äù

My heart sank.

The girls were gone, but their necklaces remained. 

It couldn‚Äôt be, could it? But the necklaces were a perfect match to the ones the girls wore in the article‚Äôs picture. Why else would Ethan have two childrens‚Äô necklaces in here? Frantically, I Googled, ‚ÄúBackwoods Butcher.‚Äù

There had been two additional suspected victims since the day I gave my mother that paper. My mind raced as I searched for Ethan‚Äôs alibis and came up empty. I wanted to scream, I wanted to call the police, but I needed to think.

‚ÄúHoney, where are you?‚Äù Ethan called from the hallway. I panicked and put the necklaces back in the drawer before closing it quietly. I was desperate to confront him, but my mother‚Äôs words rang in my head.

‚ÄúLet her off the hook.‚Äù

I thought about all the things she said, before and after she was dead. That whole time I thought she was stuck in conversations in the past, but what if she somehow knew about the future? 

‚ÄúWatched pots never boil.‚Äù What if she knew about the fire? If I had paid more attention to the burner, then the fire would never have happened.

‚ÄúTwo birds, one stone.‚Äù I thought about the necklaces as nausea crept up my throat. 

‚ÄúLet her off the hook.‚Äù My pulse raced. What does it mean? Is it.. literal?  

Who is she, and more importantly, where is she?

1ilu82s,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ilu82s/did_the_equivalent_of_a_10k_race_today_on_the/,Did the equivalent of a 10k race today on the treadmill - Super proud!,"Hello and hope everyone is doing well! I wanted to share an important milestone for my fitness journey with y‚Äôall. 

I‚Äôve been bummed out for the past week or so since I lost my job recently and then overheard my dad shaming me for my weight to my boyfriend while I was upstairs. It took an emotional toll on me as I‚Äôve been severely overweight my whole life and he knows how hard it‚Äôs affected me seeing as he would see the bullying/shaming firsthand from my peers and strangers. 

Skipping to today, I was planning on taking a shower later today, so I figured I would spend the day exercising so I would at least have a good reason to (as my hair was recently dyed and I wouldn‚Äôt want to needlessly wash some of it out so soon after getting it colored.) My boyfriend hung out at home with me for part of the day, and having ADHD, I needed someone there to hold me accountable. I use my Apple Watch more casually to track my heart rate and other vitals as I have high blood pressure and whatnot, but I do wear it during exercises. I got a walkpad/treadmill a few months ago and haven‚Äôt used it as much as I wanted to. I wanted to beat the walking exercise record and beat my 400% move goal for the award. I did set my goal from 350 to 250 since I originally planned to only walk 133 minutes (my previous exercise minutes goal) but the watch didn‚Äôt track correctly and I had to walk an extra 20 or so minutes to get past 133. By the time I did so, I ended up just deciding to walk the rest of the length of a VOD I was watching. 

I clocked about 3.85 hours, burned 1,378 calories, 6.15 miles, and 13,854 steps. This was in addition to an extra 25-30 minutes I walked to get to 550% of my move goal. A 10k race is 6.21 miles, and the fact I did almost that in one day is a huge achievement for me. I forgot to eat the entire aside from 3-4 bottles of water, two cups of coffee, and some pita chips. I was planning on making broccoli and rice for dinner but I have a few chores to do and my feet hurt.

Seeing some reels about women around my height and weight really inspired me to use my treadmill more often like they have, as it shows that I‚Äôm capable of doing it as well. However, some of them are doing 10k steps every day for a month or 100 days, I know I‚Äôm not capable of doing that just yet as my water bill would be expensive showering everyday lol! I‚Äôm thinking of doing some yoga or light weight lifting exercises to help with my strength since a work injury a couple of years ago messed up my arm strength.

I hope everyone is doing well, and remember not to be so hard on yourself. You‚Äôre doing the best you can with what works for you, and take care!

My mom was a 56 year old with Cardiovascular Disease 30% function left on her heart. She received results of her CT scan on Tuesday, they were not good at all. She was due for a density check and Pet scan this week on Tuesday and Wednesday. Back to last week she was told the nodule on her lung the CT shows it was actually a big mass front to back of her lungs.

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is could her body  have started shutting down from everything that quickly? Could it have pressurized her heart and caused a heart attack? Or maybe just passed in her sleep.

Marketing your smart home installation services requires a mix of online presence, effective networking, and genuine customer care. By implementing these strategies, you can grow your business while helping others enjoy the benefits of smart technology in their homes.

Trends in Smart Home Technology: What to Know Before You Start
--------------------------------------------------------------

Smart home technology continues to evolve, making our daily lives more convenient and efficient. As you consider diving into this exciting market, understanding current trends is essential. Here‚Äôs what you need to know before making any decisions.

### The Rise of Voice Assistants

Voice assistants have become a cornerstone of smart homes. Devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri make controlling smart devices easier than ever. You can turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, or even play music just by using your voice. This trend is only expected to grow, with more people preferring voice commands for everyday tasks.

### Smart Security Solutions

Home security has transformed dramatically with smart technology. Traditional locks and alarms are being replaced with smart door bells, cameras, and locking mechanisms. Key features to consider include:

- **Remote monitoring:** Access video feeds from your smartphone anytime.
- **Smart locks:** Control your door access through apps or voice commands.
- **Alerts:** Receive notifications when unusual activity is detected.

These solutions provide peace of mind and can be easily integrated into existing home setups.

### Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

With a growing concern for the environment, energy-efficient devices are trending. Smart thermostats, like Nest, learn your habits and adjust temperatures automatically to save energy. You can also monitor energy consumption through smart plugs and switches, which can help lower your utility bills. Investing in these solutions is not only eco-friendly but also makes financial sense over time.

### Integration with Smart Appliances

More appliances are being designed to connect with your smart home system. From refrigerators that track expiration dates to washing machines that can be controlled remotely, consumers can benefit from their appliances working seamlessly together. Key appliances to consider integrating include:

- **Refrigerators:** Smart fridges that suggest recipes based on available items.
- **Ovens:** Remote control and monitoring features for meal preparation.
- **Laundry machines:** Notifications when cycles are complete.

### Home Automation and Scheduling

Automation is a significant trend in smart home technology. With smart hubs, you can set schedules for various devices, making your life easier. For instance, you could program your lights to turn on at sunset or set your coffee maker to brew every morning at 7 AM. Routines can be tailored according to your lifestyle, which enhances convenience and improves the overall living experience.

### Enhanced Connectivity with IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a game changer in the smart home industry. Many devices can now connect to each other and communicate seamlessly. For instance, a smart thermostat can adjust its settings based on information received from a smart weather sensor outside. Ensuring you have a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout your home is crucial for optimizing these IoT devices.

### Safety and Privacy Considerations

While smart home technology improves convenience, it also raises concerns about safety and privacy. You should take precautions to protect your network from unauthorized access. Here are some tips to enhance your privacy:

- **Change default passwords:** Always change them to unique, complex passwords.
- **Use secure connections:** Invest in a quality router with security features.
- **Update software regularly:** Keep devices updated to protect against vulnerabilities.

### Personalization and User Experience

As the smart home market grows, the focus on user experience is becoming more prominent. Companies are striving to create intuitive interfaces that cater to a wide range of users. Personalized settings can help in making every user‚Äôs experience unique. For example, some smart home systems let you create profiles for family members, ensuring each person enjoys tailored settings.

Understanding these trends is crucial for anyone interested in smart home technology. By staying informed, you can make better decisions and ensure you choose products that best fit your lifestyle. As the market develops, opportunities for innovation will continue to arise, making it an exciting space to watch.

Common Challenges in Smart Home Installation and How to Overcome Them
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Smart home technology has become increasingly popular, offering convenience and efficiency for homeowners. However, the installation process can come with its own set of challenges. Understanding these common problems and how to overcome them is vital for anyone looking to dive into smart home installation. This knowledge can help save time, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately lead to a successful side hustle.

### Understanding Compatibility Issues

One of the biggest hurdles in smart home installation is compatibility. Not all devices work seamlessly together, and homeowners often assume that different brands will operate cohesively.

- Before installation, check device compatibility using resources like manufacturer‚Äôs websites or user forums.
- Opt for products that support common smart home standards like Zigbee or Z-Wave to ensure they can communicate effectively.
- Consider using a smart home hub that acts as a central controller for various devices, allowing them to work together regardless of brand.

### Navigating Wi-Fi Connectivity Challenges

Wi-Fi issues can also cause problems during the installation of smart home devices. Many smart gadgets rely heavily on a stable internet connection to function properly.

- Ensure that your Wi-Fi router is up to date and positioned strategically for optimal coverage throughout the home.
- Consider investing in Wi-Fi extenders or mesh networks if you have a large home with dead spots.
- Keep the firmware of your router and devices updated to minimize connectivity interruptions.

### Power Supply and Electrical Limitations

Some smart devices, such as smart bulbs and cameras, require a reliable power source. If a home has outdated wiring or limited access to electrical outlets, installation can become complicated.

- Check the electrical requirements of the devices you plan to install. Ensure that the existing outlets can support them.
- If necessary, hire a licensed electrician to upgrade your electrical system to meet the demands of smart devices.
- Consider battery-operated smart devices for areas with limited power access.

### Setting Up User-Friendly Interfaces

User interfaces can also present difficulties. Homeowners may find it hard to navigate complex apps or setups, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction.

- Prior to installation, familiarize yourself with the apps associated with the smart devices you are setting up. This will enable you to help customers effortlessly.
- Walk homeowners through the process of using the interface. Offer clear instructions on how to access and customize their settings.
- Provide useful tips, such as voice commands for smart assistants, to enhance their overall experience.

### Addressing Security Concerns

Security is a crucial aspect when it comes to smart home installations. Many users worry about data breaches and potential hacking.

- Advise your customers on changing default passwords and enabling two-factor authentication on devices.
- Recommend regular software updates. These often include important security patches that help protect against vulnerabilities.
- Discuss the importance of a strong Wi-Fi password to safeguard against unauthorized access to their network.

### Providing Ongoing Support

Once installation is complete, the process does not end. Homeowners may encounter issues or have questions later on. Providing ongoing support can enhance your reputation and encourage referrals.

- Offer follow-up check-ins to address any issues they might have faced post-installation.
- Create a simple troubleshooting guide for common problems and share it with your clients.
- Be available for tech support through calls or online platforms to assist with any queries.

By anticipating these common challenges in smart home installation and implementing practical solutions, you‚Äôll not only improve your service but also build trust with your clients. This approach will make your side hustle as a tech enthusiast both enjoyable and profitable.

I rent the second story while he has the rooms downstairs. Jake‚Äôs parents had bought the house for him and are paying the mortgage so his mom is my landlord but the house is under his name. 

Here‚Äôs my dilemma, I have recently had a talk with Jake about a week ago. The talk consisted of me asking him to split groceries and gas. Currently I buy all the groceries in the house and at first I told him to help himself to the food but it‚Äôs gotten to the point that he will eat everything I buy for myself for the month in less than a week. A loaf of bread? Gone in two days. A big package of hot pockets? One day. Any alcohol? I‚Äôll never see it again. The gas problem is because Jake does not have a car, in the beginning I told him if I‚Äôm home I don‚Äôt mind taking him to the grocery store or dropping him off somewhere, in the past 6 months he has taken my car more times than I can count and has never once given me money for gas or put gas in once. During our talk he did apologize and he promised me $100 for the groceries he ate during the last couple weeks. I was happy and believed we moved on.

The next day I am at work from 4:30am-7:00pm (I work two jobs back to back during the weekends) and I get a text from Jake midday telling me to wear shoes when I get home because he dropped a glass. I thank him and proceed with my day, when I get home I don‚Äôt turn on any lights and just go straight upstairs to my room because I was exhausted. The next day as I was making breakfast I noticed the couch cushions are all thrown around in the living room. It‚Äôs happened before so I go to fix it, as I‚Äôm fixing the couch I notice a little blood on one cushion. I think maybe he cut his foot with the glass so I leave it to the side for him to wash. But as I move on I‚Äôm noticing more blood, it‚Äôs on the pillows, cushions, coffee table, and a little on the floor. Obviously I‚Äôm worried and text him I noticed the blood and I ask if he‚Äôs okay which I get no response. He‚Äôs not the greatest texter so I leave it be.

Friday, the day he promised to give me the $100, I text him asking if I give him $20 cash if he can just send me $120. He says no problem and tells me he will go to the atm but it‚Äôs hours later and I ask for just the $100 which he sends me. When he gets home he asks when I‚Äôll give him the $100 cash. We argue back and forth, me swearing up and down that he promised me $100 for the groceries when we talked and him swearing he never remembered saying any exact amount then switching to never promising any money. At this point I‚Äôm crying because I‚Äôm struggling financially and I had already spent the money on a bill. Finally I tell him I can send him $50 because if I do anymore I will get an overdraft fee. He takes it and leaves.

A little more back story here, Jake has a friend named Logan. Logan and I have become a little close, close enough that we text every now and then. After becoming friends with Logan I have found out that Jake basically treats him like an atm and Logan has given Jake close to $2k and Jake has only given him about $40 back. 

So after Jake leaves and I go upstairs I get a call from Logan. Logan is asking me if Jake has sent me the money and if so how much. I tell Logan honestly, that he had sent me $100 but I sent him $50 back. Long story short, Logan had given him $120 to give me because Jake promised him I was going to give him cash so when Jake left and told Logan I didn‚Äôt have the cash Logan didn‚Äôt believe him. He asked Jake to show him he sent me the money and Jake refused. Logan and Jake fought and Logan left. Logan also tells me that they got into a big fight the other day. The fight ended with Jake on top of Logan, choking him and Logan, with a bottle in his hand, smashed it on his head. I didn‚Äôt believe it but then Logan showed me the bruises from Jake‚Äôs knees on his chest. I am obviously horrified but then Logan breaks the news that he‚Äôs also moving in.

So obviously these two guys have very violent fights and me being the only girl at home and no family close by, am terrified about what happens when they fight again because this isn‚Äôt their first physical fight. My only solution is to go to his parents about my concerns but that part is also complicated. My landlords are best friends with my boss at my main job so I worry that if I do bring this up will it backfire on me? 

I am very stressed about this situation so any advice is deeply appreciated. TIA.",1,1739148792.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

2. (19)Drank too much coffee the night before. Had to wake up early for a trip. Hit the shower so fast. Got out and instantly got one and fell against the wardrobe. Luckly didn't hurt myself
3. (22) The most dangerous one. Went to sleep at 2am. Had to catch a train at 7. Hit the shower. Fell so hard I hit my head.  Luckly I was with my mom. She noticed the disturbing sound and knocked on the door. She panicked after hearing no response from me. She broke the door and found me lying on the floor bleeding from my head. Blood was all over.

1iltyws,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1iltyws/recluse/,RECLUSE,"I have always been told I'm beautiful. Not in the way a mother tells their child they're beautiful, but in a way that makes people stop and feel almost compelled to tell me. Growing up, complete strangers would tell my mother what lovely child I was, and how I could easily be a model or an actor. I got close. I became a singer-- a stretch of a term, as I more screamed and whined on stage-- and it would be disingenuous to say my beauty didn't help with my success. Our band was up and coming, but the comments on our song clips all came to the same conclusion: it was my looks that were hooking people in, not our sound. A TikTok of mine not even promoting our song, but showing off my lazy ass Billy Loomis Halloween costume, was the only thing to get us to break a thousand listeners on Spotify.

I'm not telling you this to buff my own ego. In fact, I look in the mirror and I hate what I see. But when enough people tell you something, you start to believe it. Sure, maybe I was that beautiful. But there was nothing else to me. I didn't find myself very talented, or charismatic, or smart. I was simply a good looking guy backed by a talented group of musicians that got blessed by an algorithm. Luck on my part.

You get the point. 

I'm telling you this because it is integral to the horrors I experienced. If I wasn't beautiful, maybe she wouldn't have found me backstage that day, maybe she wouldn't have fallen in love with me. Well, her twisted, weird version of love. I think she really did love me, but I think something in her past fucked her in the brain so hard that love was synonymous with suffering. If she was human, anyways. I honestly don't know what she is. 

It started in my stomping ground, Vegas. We managed to get a gig at a local festival on the strip, so we booked a hotel and made a trip of it. I posted about it, and she showed up with a VIP pass despite us not being anywhere close to a headliner. The first thing she told me was her name, and where it came from. 

‚ÄúHi, I'm Dolly! I legally changed it because your song changed my life.‚Äù Her hand gripped mine like a vice. All of this should have been red flag number one, I mean, that song was a joke song I wrote years ago about a sex doll. 

‚ÄúThat song changed your life? The sex doll song‚Ä¶?‚Äù I was momentarily stunned.

In the song were lyrics describing what my sex doll was wearing, clothes this girl was recreating in her appearance now. Red g-string, leather skirt and fishnets, a tight band shirt. Lace up gloves and studded bracelets. She'd gotten every detail. It should have been another red flag, but it was probably nothing, right? We weren‚Äôt very well known yet, but any band of any size could get a crazy obsessed fan, right? This is the era of the internet, after all. People get famous overnight for nothing. It helped that I had that pretty privilege. 

But for all my beauty, brains did not come with it, and I humored her. ‚ÄúI mean, is that so?,‚Äù I replied. My eyes dart to my band mates, as she still hadn't let go of my hand. But they were aware of how these things were going to go. I was everything and they were background characters. I think they resented me. ‚ÄúThat's‚Ä¶interesting.‚Äù It was the nicest word I had for it. 

She finally let go of my hand, but only so she could step closer and wrap her arms around my arm. ‚ÄúYour music is my favorite.‚Äù Her voice had a saccharine quality to it. ‚ÄúAnd I might be a basic fan for this but, I‚Äôve decided you're my favorite.‚Äù A soft hand with sharp acrylics touched my face. ‚ÄúYou're just so‚Ä¶wow.‚Äù

For real? We were just local festival footnotes. How could she already be so devoted? We had one shitty album on Soundcloud and Spotify. ‚ÄúWell thank you. Did you want an autograph? Is that what I ask?‚Äù Anything to get her off of me. 

To my surprise, she shook her head and got on her toes to whisper in my ear. Her hot breath against my earlobe made my stomach turn once my brain turned the sounds into language. I felt strange as I watched her hand get closer. She slid a glove down and flashed a tattoo that turned my blood to ice. It was so realistically done, and it was of something I was terrified of: a brown recluse spider. 

‚ÄúI wanted to tell you that you'd make a beautiful corpse.‚Äù 

Before I could respond, she bounded away, her night made. I could feel the color fade from my face as my blood ran cold for a few minutes. That was one I hadn't heard before, and it triggered a panic response in my brain. I couldn't place why it did at the time, but it was so bad that I had to sit down. 

Simon, my bassist, immediately snapped me out of it. ‚ÄúMarceee-eeel, you alive over there?‚Äù

Alive. That's right, I was alive. I was still alive. It was just something creepy some weirdo said. It didn't mean anything. 

‚ÄúYou drink too much, man?‚Äù He was fair in assuming this, I didn't like to perform sober. 

‚ÄúThat girl gave me the creeps,‚Äù I said, finally standing so I could help with the instrument cases. ‚ÄúThat's all.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? What'd she say?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe said I'd make a beautiful corpse.‚Äù

The serious tone I'd attempted to throw out in the air was immediately shattered by Andres. ‚ÄúDude, that's fucking metal!‚Äù

Simon immediately threw a glare his way. ‚ÄúIt obviously fucked him up, man, don't be a dick.‚Äù

But I laughed. He was right, it was pretty metal. Maybe I was looking too into it. ‚ÄúI'm good, Sim. It is a kinda sick thing to say. She's just a wild ass fan. We want fans, right? That's all she is.‚Äù

That's all. And I had assured myself of this, stupidly. I convinced myself that I'd never even see her again, so why worry? 

Three weeks later, though, I saw her again. We were staying on the strip again for a slightly bigger festival this time. Having played the night before, we decided to take advantage of the night off and hit the strip. Clubs, booze, and casinos were all on the menu. By the time I'd hit the first bar, I was already pretty intoxicated. I took the orders of my band mates and stumbled over to the bar top, being probably very obnoxious as I tried to get the bartender's attention.

‚ÄúMarcel Star!‚Äù The sound of my stage name made me jump, because who the fuck would know it? 

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I slurred out, waving my hand. ‚ÄúDo I owe ya money or‚Ä¶‚Äù I should have known.

It was like all the alcohol left my body when I saw her face. Her outfit was different, but it was still something eerily obsessive. A drawing I‚Äôd made for our first single on Spotify was of a girl in goth adjacent clothing, like Misa Amane from Death Note. Except instead of the name of the single being written across the breast, her shirt read ‚ÄúWitness my Dolly‚Äù, the first line of that song she obsessed over.

‚ÄúYou again, huh?,‚Äù I laughed nervously. ‚ÄúYou know it's about a sex doll, right? That song? I was just some cringey teenager when I wrote it-- it was supposed to be crass and gross, it‚Äôs not a love song.‚Äù I hoped the honesty would scare her off a bit.

It did not. She just smiled bigger. ‚ÄúYou could write about a rock and it would still be beautiful,‚Äù she hummed. 

‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶‚Äù The alcohol started flooding my brain again, leaving me unable to articulate what I wanted to say. I wanted to tell her she should go now, and stay away from me, but the words never came out. My orders did, though, as the bartender finally got to me. 

‚ÄúListen, I want to apologize for what I said last time.‚Äù Her voice still had that saccharine feeling to it, and yet, her eyes seemed remorseful. ‚ÄúI was so excited to finally meet you that I, well, I guess I didn't realize I was being a creep about it.‚Äù 

The apology seemed genuine. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúPeople do say weird shit to me all the time, so I guess it wasn't too bad.‚Äù

She put her hand over my own, and I noticed that spider tattoo; it was on both sides of her wrist, like I couldn't escape it. ‚ÄúI'm sure, but I went too far. I guess I was hoping to tell you something you'd never heard before, seems you probably see pretty girls all the time. I bet they all tell you the same things, I was just trying too hard to be different.‚Äù

Was it real? Was it a trap? Looking at her, I felt something close to sympathy. Maybe she was just a little fucked up, and nothing more. She was certainly treating me like I was a much bigger person than I actually was, though, and it was weird. I was on a pedestal I had yet to earn. Nervously,  I laughed. ‚ÄúYou definitely are different.‚Äù

Trying to carry four drinks sober is hard, but doing it drunk is near impossible. Dolly, still staring at me with makeup smeared eyes, grabbed a glass. ‚ÄúLet me help you,‚Äù she said. 

I wanted to deny her, but for some stupid reason, I didn't. In her hands was my drink and Simon's. I shouldn't have let her have my drink, in hindsight, but hey, she had apologized. She knew she was weird back then. Maybe it was ok. I glanced at that tattoo once more, the spider poised for my drink. She's just some girl, it's fine.

‚ÄúWhat's with that tattoo?‚Äù I had to ask. 

She smiled. ‚ÄúRemember your AMA? A Redditor asked what you were most afraid of. Brown recluse spiders. I always thought I could help you see the beauty in them.‚Äù Her smile grew. 

I had completely forgotten about that, but as soon as she brought it up, I remembered the answer well, and the story I shared with it. 

      [u/amane_m_3]: what's your biggest fear?
       [u/marcel_starstar]: i kno its specific but brown recluse spiders. when i was a kid i went with simon to his home in missouri and one of those things bit me. turns out I have an allergy because i was nearly dead in minutes. Thank fuck for his mom being that cool under pressure type, or else i might not be here. Been terrified of them since.

‚ÄúDon't you think I'm beautiful too?‚Äù Her words pulled me out of the memory.

I couldn't lie to myself. I did find her beautiful too, and it put my guard down. ‚ÄúYou checked that out? That was like a year ago. No upvotes. We got like two responses.‚Äù Red flag. At least it should have been.

‚ÄúSo I use Reddit, so what?,‚Äù she smirked. ‚ÄúYou didn't answer me though. Don't you think I'm beautiful?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yes.‚Äù Who among us wasn‚Äôt weak to a weird goth girl with big brown eyes?

She followed me to our table, inviting herself to sit between Simon and myself, almost as if she was closing me off to him and the other two guys. 

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?,‚Äù Andres asked rudely. 

‚ÄúIt's that fan, from a few weeks ago, remember?,‚Äù I said with nervous laughter. This makes Simon frown. ‚ÄúIsn't that neat? A real fan.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet lost, bitch.‚Äù

The harshness of his words immediately made her cry, and this manipulation made me go into defense mode for her. ‚ÄúSimon, what the fuck man?‚Äù I gave her a hug to comfort her, and she immediately held on to me like she'd die if she let go.

Simon looked baffled. ‚ÄúShe's a fucking creep, remember?‚Äù His eyes go back to Dolly. ‚ÄúGet lost, bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Sim, let her at least get a pic or whatever. And keep your voice down.‚Äù Kyle shook his head. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to get ourselves kicked out, the night‚Äôs still young.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, new rule before we get famous. We should not get wrapped up with fans,‚Äù Simon rebutted. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt humor this parasocial freak.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, it's not like she's a minor. Just let her say her hellos and move on.‚Äù 

Simon conceded. ‚ÄúYou get one picture, lady,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúAfter that, get lost. We're here as a group of friends, not a band.‚Äù 

Dolly's tears stopped as soon as they had started, as if a lightswitch turned off. She had got what she wanted. She got a hug from me, and got me momentarily to turn against anyone who tried to prevent that. She sealed this victory with a selfie and a kiss. It left me dazed for a minute, until she playfully flicked some of my drink in my face. Without a word, she stole the lime garnish and sensually sucked on it as she disappeared into the nightclub crowd.

Simon stood and smacked the side of my head, not hard, but enough to hammer in what an idiot I was for letting that all just happen. ‚ÄúSet some fucking boundaries, man. She's not allowed near us anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe apologized to me,‚Äù I argued, sipping down my margarita. ‚ÄúLighten up, it's fine now.‚Äù

‚ÄúApology or not, she's still a freak. She's the type of person to steal your hair-- she was probably trying to smell you just now. She probably eats people. You're too fucking naive sometimes‚Ä¶‚Äù Like a mother, he licked a napkin and tried to rub the black lipstick from my mouth.

Soon, his words felt far away. My lips tasted sweet, and then they felt numb. I assumed it was the cocktail I was having. But it was strong, really strong, and I usually had a high tolerance. Simon continued to lecture, but it might as well have been in Russian, because my mind was gone. 

I should stop drinking this, this is really strong for a margarita, I thought to myself, continuing to drink it anyways. 

‚ÄúMarcel! Are you listening?‚Äù Simon ripped the glass from my hand. ‚ÄúThere's nothing even left in this, you're drinking air, idiot. You‚Äôre cut off.‚Äù 

Cut off. Yeah, I probably just had way too much to drink. I had the same as the rest of the guys, but it was hitting me a lot harder. 

--

‚ÄúYou idiot, she fucking drugged you.‚Äù Kyle's voice in my ear made the room stop spinning. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you ok? She fucking drugged you.‚Äù

I blinked away blurriness and soon recognized where I was. The hotel room. You didn't take me to a hospital?

I tried to sit up but failed to do so. It felt like my brain was in the ocean. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe spiked your drink or something. One minute you're drooling over an empty glass, the next you're passed out in Simon's lap. They assumed you just overdid it, but nah, I know a drugging when I see it. So I'm gonna babysit.‚Äù

‚ÄúMargarita‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered. It had tasted strange. Was that how it happened? When? I tried to pick apart the fragments of the past six hours. She did steal my lime, and flick it in my face. She‚Äôd had her fingers all in my drink the more I thought of it.  It brought up that fear I had when I'd first met her. My head pounded with each beat of my heart, and with slurred speech I begged Kyle to turn off the light. I felt tired and scared, and I just wanted to hide in the dark and cry about it. ‚ÄúMy lime‚Ä¶ It was weird, the spider is weird, she's weird. She remembered something specific, what did she remember? The spider. The spider, man‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don't know what you're talking about, but uh, sleep it off.‚Äù 

Sleep it off, I did. It was a deep, dreamless sleep, almost close to death. This was the first thought to pop into my head as consciousness crept in, and I bolted awake in horror. 

‚ÄúI'm alive, I'm alive-- I'm alive right?!‚Äù I touched my own face and arms as if to confirm this. 

‚ÄúHe's alive!,‚Äù Kyle mocked. ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Pretty Boy.‚Äù

It was like I had an audience. Kyle and Simon were on each side of the bed, and Andre was in front of the mirror at the end, doing his hair. My yelling had his attention, though. I looked at the clock beside him. 1:11PM. If I wasn't so shook up, I might have relished in the angel numbers. ‚ÄúWhat day is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, you only slept like twelve hours. Kyle here says you rode the train to Club Ketamine, huh?‚Äù Simon's joking made me visibly upset, and he got serious. ‚ÄúStay away from her, dude. We let Mike know about her, she's banned from wherever we‚Äôre at. But if you see her around again, get the fuck away. She's psycho.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a bit,‚Äù I agreed with sarcasm. It felt like I had the worst hangover in the world. ‚ÄúShit, speaking of‚Ä¶we're supposed to be at soundcheck by five, right?‚Äù Fucking three day festivals.

‚ÄúHop to it,‚Äù Kyle said. ‚ÄúI was hoping to get breakfast but I think we missed that window. I'm  not missing lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro, don't rush him,‚Äù Andre butt in.

‚ÄúHe's fine!,‚Äù Kyle assured. ‚ÄúGet a Monster and a sandwich in ‚Äòim and he'll bounce right back, right Marcy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I shoved them aside as I stumbled to the bathroom. I smacked cold water onto my face and tried to just forget the events of the night before. She's banned. She's not coming back. Mike's a good security guard, he wouldn't let that happen. But I'd be lying if I said that the whole ordeal had me very on edge. I think that's why Kyle was hamming me up, I think he was trying to make me feel better. It was sweet, albeit annoying. 

I threw up twice, changed out of last night's clothes, skipped a shower and drank some hotel room coffee. It helped me feel a little more human, enough so that I gave in to Kyle's pestering to go get some food to eat. 

I opted for tied back hair and large sunglasses, hoping it would offer some anonymity, and kept my head low as we walked to the nearest fast food joint. Every short, blonde haired girl that crossed our path sent a jolt through me, as I feared that any one of them could be Dolly. It happened a few times before Simon took notice. 

‚ÄúTake it easy,‚Äù he assured as he held the door open for us. ‚ÄúAfter Kyle dragged you back to the room, we found that freak passed out on the floor of the men's room. We called the cops-- though they weren't much help, seems we didn't have evidence. I mean, people OD in Vegas night clubs every night.‚Äù

I shot a glare at Kyle. ‚ÄúEvidence could have been gotten at the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Kyle, I thought that's what you were doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I wasn't gonna drunk drive. Besides, unlike you pansies, I've done plenty of drugs.‚Äù Not something to be proud of, dude. ‚ÄúI knew he just needed to sleep it off.‚Äù 

It didn't feel worth arguing. ‚ÄúRegardless,‚Äù Simon sighed. ‚ÄúShe seemed pretty freaked out about the very possibility of getting arrested, so she's probably gonna leave us alone now.‚Äù

I wondered how he could be so sure. Maybe it was all an act, just like that apology was. She was a good manipulator. But Simon wasn't dumb like I was. I felt like I could trust him. So, I tried to push thoughts of Dolly to the back of my mind. 

‚ÄúBut!‚Äù Simon broke me out of my thoughts. ‚ÄúLet this be a lesson to you, and to all of us. I guess we're at the level where we're almost recognizable now. We have to be careful around anyone outside our circle. I know ya‚Äôll grew up here in Vegas and probably thought nothing ‚Äòbout hitting the strip last night. But we can't be careless like that, and last night was a big fucking reason why.‚Äù

‚ÄúLighten up, Sim, she's a one in a million case, I'm sure,‚Äù Andre argued.

‚ÄúFucking doubt it, and its only gonna get worse. She shouldn't have been there at all. What kind of person travels three hours to find a no-name band not even at their show, but at some night club? An obsessed fucking stalker. You guys might think you see weird every day, living here, but I grew up in Missouri. I've seen some fucked up shit. You can't underestimate anyone.‚Äù

I figured he had a point, even if the other guys were laughing it off and teasing him about how his twang came out when he was upset. All I could do now was hope she wasn't willing to travel any more. To my relief, the night's show went off without issue, albeit my performance was probably lacking. I just needed time.

We only had two more gigs booked for the following weeks, and then a break, which I was grateful for. That incident, embarrassingly, had kept me up for three nights straight. The fact she wasn't arrested had me horribly on edge, because it meant she could be anywhere. Each day I was refreshing my tags in Instagram, looking to see if she ever posted that selfie she took with us. That would be the only photo I'd have of her, and yet, I found nothing, even after hours of scrolling. There was nothing I could show Mike, or police, and a verbal description only got me so far. Short, blonde, and petite described a plethora of girls in the scene. I had no option but to trust Simon that she was not going to be a problem anymore. But what did he know?

The first of the following two gigs went surprisingly well. It was more intimate venue, which frightened me at first  but I never saw her. For the first time in days, I relaxed some and even went out with the guys. As we drunkenly stumble back to the hotel room, I opted for a shower to try and sober up a bit. This is where my prolonged nightmare began. 

As I drew open the curtain to bathe, I let out a scream from the pits of my soul. There, struggling to crawl out of the bottom of the bath tub, was not one, but three fucking brown recluse spiders. 

The guys didn't react immediately, as I was no stranger to scream based vocal exercises in the shower, but a half dressed and panicked me barreling through the bathroom door certainly caught their attention. 

‚ÄúWoah, Marcel, the strip club's not till tomorrow night!,‚Äù Kyle joked, throwing one of his shirts at me. 

It fell unceremoniously to the floor as I stood there stammering, unable to form a sentence. ‚ÄúTh-three of them, three of the fucking things--‚Äù I choked out. 

‚ÄúThree what?‚Äù Simon attempted to calm me down. 

‚ÄúRecluse. Spiders--‚Äù

‚ÄúNuh uh,‚Äù Kyle replied, getting up to look for himself. ‚ÄúOh shit!,‚Äù he yelled from the bathroom. ‚ÄúI mean, yeah, there's definitely three spiders for sure. I'll save you, princess!‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, chill out,‚Äù Simon lectured, pushing me to sit on the bed. ‚ÄúIt's just a spider.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree,‚Äù I corrected. 

‚ÄúIt's just three spiders then. They're dead now, you can stop freaking out.‚Äù

As Kyle strode out of the bathroom like some knight in shining armor, I manically ran back in. Visions of that tattoo were flashing in my head. ‚ÄúDid you save the bodies?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fuck? No. I washed em down the drain.‚Äù

‚ÄúI needed to see what kind, damn it.‚Äù I had to be sure what kind they were. Did I really see what I thought I did? All I could think about was her and her tattoos, and how fucking specific they were. I rushed to the bathroom, hoping maybe they didn't go down, but as I knelt over the shower drain, all I saw was a wet tub floor. How can I be sure now? I needed to see the fiddle back‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDude, are you on drugs? What the hell is going on with you?‚Äù Simon‚Äôs hand felt like ice on my shoulder, causing me to jump. 

‚ÄúI could understand one-- but three? Three, in my hotel room-- you saw her tattoos right? You saw them?‚Äù Seventy-two straight hours of no sleep had me sounding like a mad man. 

Simon was visibly unnerved. ‚ÄúH-hey man, why don't we skip the shower and just lay down, huh? We can talk about it later, ok?‚Äù His voice was careful, like a parent. 

I was upset he didn't believe me, despite the fact I gave him no reason to. 

‚ÄúMar, come on. Hotels get bugs all the time. You're being paranoid. I get that they scare ya but this? You sound crazy.‚Äù 

It was an overreaction. How could it not be? Slowly, I got to my feet and moved to the bed. He was right. I had to sleep. My thoughts were going a million miles a minute, and nothing was making sense. I'm losing it. They were just normal ass spiders. Had to be.

Exhaustion won in the end, and I finally slept. I wouldn't say it was sound, however. I kept dreaming of spiders in the blankets, and by the time the sunlight woke me up, I had all the covers on the floor. 

I was alone when I sat up. Kyle was supposed to share the room with me, but I figured they just continued the party after my little freak out in Andres's room. I couldn't blame them. 

Sleep had me feeling much less erratic, and after psyching myself up for nearly twenty minutes, I was even able to shower. By the time I was dressed and sipping coffee, I was starting to believe that the events of the night before were unjustified. House spiders, daddy long legs, they could have been anything. This could just be a dirty hotel. I shouldn't have freaked out the way I did. I figured I should apologize to the guys. 

Before that, though, I wanted to fact check one little thing on my phone. It had been bothering me up to this point. 

Brown recluses spiders are not common in Nevada. But people claim to have seen them. Nothing I read gave me a straight answer, and it frustrated me. 

‚ÄúBut they've been found here, look this article says someone got bit in Clark County. So it's not impossible. While I'm not saying that's definitely what you saw, if you did, it could be coincidence. Not that girl. I bet, if they were brown recluse, they were in someone's luggage or something.‚Äù After an initial apology, I had brought this up to Simon, who was now trying to be rational of it all. ‚ÄúOr look here, there's desert recluses. That's probably what you saw.‚Äù

I appreciated his rationality, but I still felt apprehensive. Since she had missed the show, it would have been three days since I'd seen her. Three spiders. I brought this up to Simon.

‚ÄúThat could also be coincidence. You're getting paranoid, man. We haven't seen her, she's probably done with us. You're fine-- let it go.‚Äù

Maybe he was right. I tricked myself into believing that, and had almost let the thought go by soundcheck. By the third song of our set-- yes, the t h i r d, I had even let my guard down. Until our eyes met. 

Among the sweaty young moshers and stoic old heads, there she stood. She didn't blink, just smiled that saccharine smile. I froze. 

I couldn't sing. I couldn't speak. My heart pounded with each beat of the drums until the drums stopped. The guitar stopped, the bass. It got quiet, very quiet to me. The boos of the crowd and my name coming out of the mouths of bandmates sounded hundreds of miles away. It was just me, and her. 

‚ÄúGo on!,‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúPlay ‚ÄòDolly‚Äô.‚Äù

I sucked in a breath and turned away, storming offstage. I felt dizzy as I stumbled around the back of the venue, not noticing that Simon had abandoned the stage to come find me.

‚ÄúDude, what the fuck are you doing?‚Äù His hand on my shoulder pulled me out of that flashbanged state. ‚ÄúAre you good?‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw her. In the crowd.‚Äù

Any hints of irritation he had faded immediately. ‚ÄúPoint her out.‚Äù

But she was gone. Had I imagined her? No shot. I heard her. We tried asking other people in the crowd where she had gone, a lot of them were unhelpful though. They were pissed I just ruined the show. That was the last thing on my mind. 

‚ÄúI saw her.‚Äù Finally, a lead. A woman with a buzzed head and a beer had some genuine concern on her face. ‚ÄúI found her on the strip, we got an Uber here together. We were dancing and shit but she got all weird when your band showed up.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know where she went?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúI don't, I asked her if she knew you when you stopped playing and she just dipped. She an ex?‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, no,‚Äù Simon spat. ‚ÄúIs that all you got?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I thought she was cool, albeit a little odd. I think she was on drugs. Had this baggie in her purse and everything.‚Äù The girl shrugged again. ‚ÄúGood luck, and goodbye. No shot they'll let you play here again.‚Äù

That was genuinely the least of my concerns. 

Feeling sick to my stomach from the fear of not knowing, I bolted to the bathroom in a panic. When Simon found me, I was a crumpled mess on the floor of the stall, in the midst of a full anxiety attack. 

‚ÄúMarcel, get ahold of yourself,‚Äù he scolded, pulling me to my feet. ‚ÄúShe's just a person. She couldn't have disappeared, the cops or whatever will find her. But we can't do anything rational if you keep freaking out like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not it--‚Äù I stammered out, catching my breath. Slipping behind him like a child hides behind their parent, I pointed a shaking hand at the corner of the stall. ‚ÄúIt's that.‚Äù

He payed for my gas, was a gentleman, we had a really good late night where he wanted to cuddle all night. Honestly, I think he's out of my league but I think we connected really well. I can't read his face very well. In the morning he made me breakfast and coffee and offered to start my car.. he told me to medzage when I got home. I couldn't tell if he liked me or not and my younger sisters Said to let him message first because sometimes I'm a little eccentric I'm obviously over thinking this but should I wait for him to message or should I message him?

1iltxqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iltxqa/can_you_provide_advice_on_using_the_leverpresso/,Can you provide advice on using the Leverpresso more efficiently?,"I am new to manual espresso shots and am looking for strategies for using the Leverpresso Pro more efficiently.

My biggest issue so far is the time it takes to prep and pull a shot. Would a flair have been a better choice? Would a portafilter and tamping prep stand make a significant difference? At least many traditional tamp stations would work. Everything with Leverpresso takes more time. Particularly if I am trying to pull multiple shots.

I am getting the flair power tower for the 1zpresso J-ultra to remove the hand-grinding aspect. For Aeropress, I use pre-ground coffee or my Breville smart grinder Pro. The J-ultra is much better for the Leverpresso, but it is time-consuming.

I also stopped using the Leverpresso Pro stand. For pre-heating, I can just put the top half in my sink and run hot water through it. But not using the stand means I can‚Äôt use a measuring cup or a scale underneath to measure output.

Could people share their workflows and identify what made them more efficient? I am willing to buy anything that saves time or reduces complexity.

Thoughts? Suggestions? I need to get the time closer to the efficiency of the Aeropress.

On the plus side, dialing in is going really well!",2,1739148433.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1iltxew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1iltxew/amway_and_other_mlms_are_recruiting_in_reno/,"Amway and other MLMs are recruiting in Reno, please be careful.  They are pretending to be ‚Äúe-commerce‚Äù businesses with different names.","They are recruiting strangers in public places in Reno and the surrounding areas including retailers. coffee shops, and public parks.  They will invite you out for a coffee and act like it is just hanging out, no mention of business.  This leads to a zoom ‚Äúinterview‚Äù while pretending it is a startup or actual online store.  

Amway and many other MLM consultants are operating ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù that have their own unique names (ex. Sierra top level marketing, Desert high ticket solutions), so it appears to be an independent small business but is actually part of a large corporation.  

Due to the negative press about MLMs, these corporations now have consultants operate their ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù under a different name.  They also try to hide the fact that they are an MLM.  

I asked if they were from Amway, then Pikachu face from the recruiter.  Literally just googling the book they told me to read gives away that it is Amway.

Some of these people may be genuinely nice but do not realize the MLM company is predatory.  It is also very hard to tell if they are genuinely nice or faking it because that is how MLM recruiters target people.  ",47,1739148404.0,Reno,16,0.96,False
1iltwqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iltwqy/adhd_med_efficacy_and_whatever_is_happening_to_me/,ADHD med efficacy and whatever is happening to me,"34/f/196 lbs

Meds are Adderall XR 10 mg (this mg for about 4 years, but I've taken it since high school and at a much larger dose back then.) Trintellix 20 mg and Lamictal 100 mg. B12 and vitamin D. Once a day for all. 

I have had a blood test and am going to the doctor on Monday. Blood test came back seemingly normal, but I haven't had anyone explain it to me yet. That's for Monday. 

I'm not sure what's going on. It feels like my meds half stopped working and my emotions became incredibly flat, no one and nothing feels real and time feels nonexistent. 

Timeline:

Had a period where my left arm and leg started becoming 'numb' or just felt like I lost awareness of them. Eventually got better after a few weeks. Then suddenly my right foot would feel warm and wet on and off throughout the day. It's become much less frequent as of now, I think. 

Had a few days where I felt tired and sniffly. The weather was warming up, so I figured it was having a weird reaction to that. It wouldnt be the first time weather going from cold to warm made me tired. Was on my period, which is highly regular. It ended uncharacteristically early. 

Ran out of melatonin so I took a new brand of 10 mg melatonin (my usual.)

Next day, started feeling weird, blew it off as illness or the weather.

Over the next few days everything and everyone stopped feeling real. My emotions became very flat. Social anxiety ramped up. EXTREME, debilitating fatigue. Zero focus or sense of time. Arms and legs have feeling but somehow don't. A depression unlike anything I've ever felt before. Began feeling suicidal because I spent 4 days feeling trapped behind glass with no way out, so I texted a hotline and called friends. 

On the third night my friend gave me a brand of melatonin I've used. I got rid of the other stuff and started using this one, which is 5 mg instead. 

Today, the morning was rough and I felt unsteady. Started to feel a tad better after taking my Adderall and drinking some coffee. Emotions felt like they were coming back some. 

I'm staying at a friend's house this weekend and I still don't feel entirely there, but something seems to be improves a bit. This sounds weird, but sometimes the Adderall side effects of anxiety helped me keep on track and I'm really feeling very little, which isn't great for my productivity, which I already suffer with. The world still feels weird and somewhat dreamy.

Additional: 

About a month and a half before all this I had a terrible ear infection. It took weeks to go away and my right ear really siffered. I ended up seemingly contracting it again but much more mild. Seemed to go away, but my right ear still bothers me and still has some muffling. Pretty positive I have TMJ as it also runs in my family. 

My neck and back have been bothering me on and off. I'm a top heavy girl who also has the habit most of us have of looking down at my phone. As of about 3 weeks ago it's started to feel like something in my neck was rubbing against something else. Very uncomfortable.

Frankly I'm scared and weirded out. I'm afraid I'll never feel normal again, or that something in my brain or nerves broke and my meds will never work again, which is the only thing that's helped me with ADHD and depression. When I talked to my original PCP, he told me that going to a mental health facility could be a good idea. I decided to make an appointment with someone else in the same office so I can get perspective from a doctor that hasn't known me since high school. I'll be seeing her Monday. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or heard of such a thing? The only times I can think that are even remotely similar are when I've had really bad infections and for some reason those messed with how well my meds worked before getting better again. Thing is, other than some ear clogging, I don't feel sick. Is like to bump up my Adderall from 10 to 15 if  I don't get better by next refill. I'm terrified they'll decide they won't let me. I'm a mess all around. ",1,1739148343.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False
