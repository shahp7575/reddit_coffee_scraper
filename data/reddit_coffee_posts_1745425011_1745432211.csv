It had been weeks by now. Months even. Since he contracted this- ailment. What could be done? This is how he had to live now- half live. Survive. It was easy to hide. He was sick. Nothing else.
Sliding on gloves over elongated blackened fingernails and fingertips. An arm through a sleeve next. Breeches over lanky legs. Waistcoat and blazer acting like a cape to disguise his thin, warped shape. A little glance towards the silver mirror, he‚Äôd not dare to touch ungloved. A little more seen with each Garment.
 It pleased him to be seen again. 
Lifting it up and placing it on his head, his face was shaded by the rim of a tall, eccentric top hat. A little glint in his eye was the only thing seen between the hat and the top of his clerical collar, constricting around his throat like a clean, white snake. The symbol stood to mean nothing to him. Not now. It caused him no fret. 
A sigh of relief to see himself fully robed again. He didn‚Äôt want to do it. He did not like to. 
Wiping a ghost of red from a slackened jaw with a pristine white cloth, staring back at himself through black hollows as he did. It was strange for his eyes to look at. The smear across the pale, ghostly fabric. A reflection of his own complexion and stained morality. 
Clearing his throat and carefully folding the evidence of his crimes, a moment of calm. Relief. Before stuffing it into his inner pocket, closest to his heart. The now crushed fabric. Hidden. Quickly supplanted by another, just as pristine as the last. 

Sitting- only to put shoes on. This tall, wraithlike man raises, like some phantom restored from death. 
He reached for his cane.
The sound of metal soles and wooden cane clicking against hardwood floors, muffled only by tasselled carpets and fringed rugs. Briefly the sound of a door unlocking and swinging open, the sounds of carriages on cobbles and omnibuses on rails, leaching into his brain like a tick. It drew a rattle from him, like wind blowing though hollow bones.
He took one, two steps onto the streets, the sound of the heavy oak door almost slamming to a close, the sound of its heavy lock clicking back into place behind him. 
He paused, fixing his gloves, acclimatising to his surroundings before he finally set off, down the streets, the constant vexation of a spartan heat on his back as he watched ladies clutching their shawls. 
It irked him to see it. He hated that balmy nipping against his cold body. The constant burn of what seemed thin air. The feeling that, shot a pulsing ache through his very bones and scream while others worshipped it. It made him want to claw and rip at flesh. But he buried that deep within the guts of his body. Thoughts he would never say aloud. Perhaps act out on. But never utter it. Never would the admission of guilt leave his chapped and stained lips.
Winding streets and windy weather eventually led him to a small coffeehouse, wedged between two large, incredibly dull apartments. A sign that read ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô in chipped white enamel hung in the inside of the open door. After a brief glance at it, eyes grazing over the word, he stepped inside, his attention shifting to another, dressed similarly to himself. 
He walked over, ‚ÄúWesley, my friend.‚Äù He sighed out in an already bored, and transactional tone. The last words uttered, falling dead. After a few more steps, he sat, opposite the other. 
They both looked similar- torn from the same cloth, perhaps. Which was odd considering their opposing demeanours. Oh well, all in the name of a little entertainment. 
The man, crowned Wesley, immediately found a large smile to plaster on his face. ‚ÄúAmbrose! My dearest companion!‚Äù he said, rising to his feet to hug the man before he sat. The tall, dark man went stiff as a board. 
A hug from Wesley felt like a hug from death himself. One that would just squeeze the life left in him, out. Like an animal in a snare, he unadroitly tried to escape. Yet the man held him, his arms around him stiff as a corpse for several more moments before he released him. 
Wesley simply chuckled as he watched his friend fuss himself, offering a little help here and there. During which Ambrose rolled his eyes and caught glance of a few specks of red just on the cuff of the shorter‚Äôs sleeve. He made sure not to gawk too long but committed the image to his mind.
 ‚ÄúHunting?‚Äù Ambrose asked as he sat down, resting his cane against the wall they sat beside. Wesley looked startled for a moment, his pale skin somehow turning paler before he quickly laughed it off. ‚ÄúAh, no, I nicked myself preparing a nice breakfast this morning.‚Äù He chuckled. Ambrose nodded. But saw no evidence of injury.

The sound of voices filled the coffee house, even when they were the only ones there, there was always the sound of someone, usually Wesley, speaking or jabbering. Talking until coffee went cold. 
Only the sound of church bells chiming dared to interrupt him. Yet at that it took, for a rather intrusive voice asking them to pay and get out- telling that they had sat until past mid-day talking over a cup of coffee each without ordering anything else. That they had stayed past their welcome. 
Wesley glanced at his cup at that, inky black liquid staring back at him. Only then did the contrasting duplicates rise from their seats- Ambrose with his cane and Wesley lifting his umbrella from the hook.
 They each placed a few shillings before they made their way down the streets. In wordless agreement, Ambrose made his way back the way he had come, only now, with the addition of Wesley, making a detour through the park. 
The taller glanced down at his compact, dwarf-like companion. Only now noticing another few splatters of red on the inside of his shirt collar, a small, bemused glint coming to his eye before he caught himself and smothered in, filing the knowledge to the back of mind to tick away with the apprehension of the previous dot of red and the story that had followed. 
He couldn‚Äôt help it as a small chuckle escaped from him. Grabbing Wesley‚Äôs attention from the path ahead. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The man asked, glancing up to the other.
 ‚ÄúOh, nothing.‚Äù Ambrose muttered softly, shaking his head a little.
 ‚ÄúNo- no! I have never heard you snigger, much less chortle. What is it?‚Äù he asked with a frown. 
‚ÄúAnd I have never seen you frown. Seems we both have seen something new within each other.‚Äù The more imposing of the two retorted, earning a childlike miff from Wesley. 

It was not long after, that the pair made it to the red front door of no.13 Hanging Hill. 
Reaching into his pocket to pull out the keys, he unlocked the door, stepping in and wiping his feet on a mat that read welcome, stepping aside, and holding the rather heavy door open for Wesley to follow. But he didn‚Äôt, he stood, smiling as if awaiting something.
 ‚ÄúWell come on, in you come‚Äù Ambrose said. Only then did the shorter follow in the taller‚Äôs footsteps. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rude not to welcome a guest in!‚Äù He argued with a small laugh, clearly in a much better vein than in the park. 
Ambrose held his doubts as the heavy door fell closed. Only then did the pair remove their hats and rather long coats, when they were shut off from the rest of the world. Like two actors changing after curtain call. Like a game of cat and mouse. They both know the rules.

1k66061,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k66061/could_the_elite_gourmet_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Could the Elite Gourmet Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"The **Elite Gourmet EHC114 Personal Single-Serve Compact Coffee Maker** has been my daily companion for a couple of weeks now, and it has definitely changed how I approach my morning routine. With a personal coffee maker like this, my countertop feels lighter, and my busy mornings start with a touch of brewing magic. While the product is compact and practical, there are both upsides and areas that could use improvement. Sit back as I break it all down for you!

**Compact Design and Space-Saving Abilities**  
Living in a small apartment, I‚Äôm always on the hunt for products that make the most of my limited space. This coffee maker delivers in that department. Measuring just 6.5‚ÄùD x 5‚ÄùW x 9.5‚ÄùH, it neatly fits into corners without cluttering my countertop. The sleek black matte finish isn‚Äôt just visually appealing; it also doesn‚Äôt scream for attention amidst other appliances. Its lightweight construction makes it easy to move around, although being mostly constructed from plastic could potentially give it a less premium feel for some. Still, I can‚Äôt deny how much easier it is to tuck this machine away compared to bigger brewers.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
No complicated settings or confusing dials here! The one-touch operation is one of my favorite aspects. Press a button, brew, and go‚Äîit‚Äôs as simple as that. With a 600-watt power capacity, it brews a 14-ounce cup of coffee in just a few minutes. There's no long wait like many drip machines, which is perfect when you‚Äôre running late. It includes an automatic shut-off feature that further adds peace of mind. I‚Äôve left the house more than once, only to realize I hadn‚Äôt turned it off‚Äîbut guess what? No burned coffee or worrying about accidents.

**Reusable Filter for Sustainability**  
As someone trying to reduce waste wherever possible, the inclusion of a removable and reusable filter was a standout feature. I‚Äôve been able to use fresh ground coffee without dealing with disposable paper filters. Not only does it cut down on costs, but it also lets me experiment with the flavors I love most. Cleaning it takes only a few seconds, and since it‚Äôs dishwasher-safe, scrubbing by hand is optional. Although the filter works well, I noticed that grinds can occasionally spill over if not properly aligned, which is a bit annoying.

**The 14-Ounce Travel Mug Advantage**  
This personal coffee maker isn‚Äôt just about brewing at home; it‚Äôs designed for your hustling lifestyle. It comes with a stainless steel travel mug that fits under the coffee spout perfectly. I like that the mug is insulated, which keeps my coffee warm long enough for commutes or early meetings. It also fits snugly in my car‚Äôs cup holder, which is essential for spill-free travel. However, the lid doesn‚Äôt always seal tightly, and I‚Äôve had small leaks on occasion, making me less inclined to throw it into my bag.

**Positives**  
Here‚Äôs what stands out about this coffee maker:  
- Space-saving design works perfectly for small kitchens, dorms, or RVs.  
- The reusable filter is eco-friendly and budget-friendly.  
- The quick brew time is incredibly convenient for busy mornings.  
- One-touch operation keeps things straightforward for users of all experience levels.  

**Negatives**  
Still, there are aspects that might not sit well with everyone:  
- The plastic build may feel flimsy to users expecting a premium design.  
- Occasional spilling of coffee grounds from the reusable filter.  
- The travel mug‚Äôs lid could fit more securely to prevent leaks during travel.  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
When it comes to the brew itself, it competes well with pricier single-serve machines. I enjoy the consistency‚Äîwhether it's a mild roast or an espresso-like strength, it pulls through. Heating is quick and efficient; the coffee is steamy but not scalding hot. I did notice that larger grind sizes worked best with the filter. Finer grounds sometimes clog and slow the brewing process, making it less seamless than intended.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this to other single-serve brewers, I‚Äôd say its main competitor is the Keurig K-Mini. While the Keurig boasts a slightly more premium design, it doesn‚Äôt come with a travel mug, which makes the Elite Gourmet stand out for on-the-go coffee lovers. Additionally, unlike other budget-friendly machines like the Hamilton Beach Scoop, this model includes an automatic shut-off and reusable filter without compromising affordability. Both the Keurig and Hamilton are slightly bulkier, taking up more of your counter‚Äôs real estate compared to this slim option. On the downside, the Keurig‚Äôs brewing versatility (e.g. K-cup compatibility) is certainly appealing, though it generates more waste.

**Quality for Price**  
Evaluating what it brings to the table compared to its price, this personal coffee maker offers great quality for its cost. Its space efficiency, reusable filter, and travel-friendly mug make it accessible to multiple types of users‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs students in dorms, busy workers commuting, or someone living in a compact space. Moreover, the easy operation eliminates unnecessary complexity, catering to both first-time users and seasoned coffee aficionados. While it lacks some of the advanced features of higher-end brewers, it still punches above its weight in terms of functionality and convenience.

1k65zt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k65zt5/i_22f_have_been_with_my_boyfriend_24m_for_a_few/,I (22f) have been with my boyfriend (24m) for a few years and am feeling stuck.,"I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for a few years and I‚Äôm feeling scared and stuck

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî I‚Äôve always had some trust issues from my past, and that‚Äôs affected our relationship at times. Early on, I struggled with the fact that he kept working at a job his ex got him. It got to a point I accused him of cheating every day because I found some things weird  and he would get in trouble for being on his phone trying to reason with me. He actually never did cheat. 

He‚Äôs always been super into gaming and would get upset if he didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúenough‚Äù time ‚Äî like 2 hours wasn‚Äôt enough. That being said, he also went a while and never picked up a controller because he thinks I‚Äôm pissed anytime he plays because I‚Äôm quiet and stay to myself. I should‚Äôve been more supportive and encouraged him to play way more, especially since I could use that time to focus on crafting or working on starting our business that he is more than willing to help with if he can just enjoy things sometimes too. 

On top of that, there have been multiple times he‚Äôs physically hurt me. He says these times came when I had screamed at him for hours at a time, called him names, or made hurtful allegations about things that I now know for sure never happened. He also says he regrets it deeply and went and got help. While getting help his therapist just brushed him off (I heard the online sessions) (he has also ran multiple counselors off when he was younger) and he quit going and fixed that issue on his own. I still feel scared sometimes and he says he hates that because he feels as if no matter how hard he works he will always be that person and can never be anything but that person. When we talk he says mean things and I get called names, but they primarily happens after he‚Äôs ignored for hours. Or because he thinks what I say it‚Äôs stupid and will call me LOTS of names. It hurts me deeply but I tell him if it makes him feel better than to call me them. He also struggles with it because I have friends I can go to at any time and he never speak  to anybody. It‚Äôs not even an option. He‚Äôs never really had friends. One of them I used to work with and he told me that they aren‚Äôt friends because of the way my bf acted towards him but I never know if that‚Äôs the truth because we know how people are. 

He was doing MMA for a while, and after some time I told him it made me uncomfortable ‚Äî because I genuinely felt like it was a dangerous sport. He didn‚Äôt take it well. He still doesn‚Äôt. He talks about how he feels like something is missing because of it all the time. He also gets frustrated because I‚Äôd watch exes and friends play football and go to boxing classes with someone with a history of assault charges. He doesn‚Äôt see why those people get to participate in sports and things and get supported but he doesn‚Äôt get that support. To be honest my anxiety and being scared has became worse and worse. 

I‚Äôve told him I know I‚Äôve been controlling at times, and I‚Äôve even said I need help for that. But when I bring up his anger, he get upset because he feels as if it‚Äôs natural to be angry when you give up what he has. I see more problems with his anger than he does. I see things he doesn‚Äôt the same as he does with me. 

Sometimes he does try to talk to me calmly, but I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî I get so overwhelmed with fear of saying the wrong thing or making it worse that I shut down. I ignore it, not because I don‚Äôt care, but because I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôve gotten used to walking on eggshells. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally trigger something that will lead to yelling or breaking things or worse. But he tells me that ignoring him is the worst thing to do because he‚Äôs depressed because he‚Äôs lonely and not included and this just doubles those feelings. 

This morning we weren‚Äôt actually running late, just behind according to my own mental schedule. I suggested he make coffee at his grandma‚Äôs (we both work for her) instead of at home, and when the machine didn‚Äôt work, he snapped at me in front of her. Later, when I asked him to help vacuum a room while I was mopping, he made a fist ‚Äî not because he was going to hit anything, but because he didn‚Äôt want to be around me and just wanted to do the task himself. (The last thing he actually broke was a plastic yard chair, months ago, but even moments like this still scare me.)

Even when I try to stay calm, things normally  still escalate. Sometimes I just say ‚Äúokay‚Äù to avoid conflict, but somehow that makes him even angrier. He says it‚Äôs because he feels his opinions aren‚Äôt valued. 

I‚Äôve done things in this relationship that I‚Äôm not proud of ‚Äî things I‚Äôve been trying to own and grow from. But it feels like he only brings them up when he‚Äôs mad at me, almost as a weapon. But he says it‚Äôs because he feels hurt and when he brings it up it‚Äôs ignored. And it feels like we‚Äôre fighting nearly every day now. I know I‚Äôm not perfect, but I don‚Äôt believe he is either ‚Äî it feels like both of us have done harm, but when others look in from the outside, I‚Äôm the one painted as the ‚Äúbad one.‚Äù So many people tell him to break up with me, but when I say ‚Äúthen break up with me,‚Äù he won‚Äôt. He just refuses ‚Äî even if neither of us is happy. He believes it‚Äôs fixable but feels as if no matter how hard he tries I won‚Äôt try as hard for him. He feels as if he‚Äôs changed things and I‚Äôve changed nothing. To be honest I think maybe breaking up could be best. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about moving back home because I feel so unhappy and unsafe ‚Äî but when I bring that up, he makes me feel like absolute shit for even considering it. Part of the reason he feels like this is unfair is my step dad does all the things he wants to do but is treated like a dad but knows that if he does them he will be left and not treated like a boyfriend, (I feel this is because I know I can say how I feel to my boyfriend and not my stepdad) but I also feel completely drained and scared. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting, if I‚Äôm the problem, or if this is just what a rough patch looks like. I just know I don‚Äôt feel okay anymore. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore but he won‚Äôt break up with me.  What do y‚Äôall think? Yes I know I will probably be the bad one but is he bad as well? 

ETA: I have also grown up in a super toxic house hold and I carried some of those traits with me sadly. He brings that up a lot to talk bad about my family and how I grew up ",0,1745431625.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

Fast food makes me hungrier. 

How the heck did I not make the connection before now?? It's my only ""addiction."" I've never smoked, never even tried weed, don't drink any alcohol at all, no coffee, moderate soda intake, etc. But for some reason I often have serious cravings for fast foods like burgers and fries, or pizza. I'm overweight (not obese, but could definitely afford to shed some pounds) almost exclusively because of that, and I know that's why, but the cravings are so strong that I often just can't help myself. I'm pulling through a drive-thru 4x a week at a minimum. And it never seems to satisfy me enough; I could eat fast food for breakfast, lunch, a snack, and two dinners and still want more! The fact that I don't weigh like five hundred pounds is a testament to my willpower, because I have cravings enough to put me at that weight if I didn't resist them most of the time. I'm always ravenously hungry, even strongly considered taking Wegovy or something just to stop feeling the urge to eat. 

And it just finally dawned on me that I'm hungry all the time *because* of the fast food. When people say it's garbage or junk food or whatever, I always interpreted that as ""It's not home-cooked food, has too much salt, etc."" Not that the food is *literally* just junk that doesn't do the job that food is supposed to do at all! I can't believe it took me this long to realize it. I even Googled it to see if I was correct, and yep, known phenomenon due to the blood sugar spike (and subsequent crash) caused by all the empty carbs and poor nutritional content.

I don't like cooking (which is how I fell into the fast food trap in the first place), but last week I started cooking every single night and exclusively eating food I prepared at home, and the difference is amazing. My appetite has been cut in half, and I stay full so much longer. When I finally start getting hungry again, it's not a roaring ""OMG FEED ME NOW!!"" like it was before; it's just a quiet reminder that I should probably eat soon. It's such a relief!! I hated the constant drive to eat, eat, eat, but it was overwhelming. I'm already down 6 pounds and I feel more energetic too. Any time I drive past a fast food place now, I start feeling tempted, and then I think of that starving feeling I always had, and remind myself that it's a trap to get me to feel that way again, and I just drive right on by.

God I wish I had made the connection years ago; I would have saved so much time and money! I just spent my lunch break typing this instead of eating, because I had half a sandwich, apple slices with peanut butter, and an orange a few hours ago and I'm still full. ü§©",5,1745431618.0,CasualConversation,1,0.86,False

I'm Kozmo, I've been RPing for many years with many different characters, I'm in EST time and I usually can get back to people a good few times a day. I would prefer no RP Partners under 21, and I personally do not care how you identify. I don't mind OOC talk, plot/direction talk not withstanding (that should be a given I should think). Replies on my end can get kinda length, but some situations I feel don't call for endless paragraphs, like if our characters are having coffee in the morning and are just talking. I try to match my partners.  
  
 At the moment I have a wolf character I've been wanting to do more with, he's not quite a werewolf but more of a being that can move between Wolf, Man, and some inbetweens like the traditional stock, two-legged Werewolf. Your character can be an OC you already have floating around or if you'd prefer to make someone new that is more than okay too. 

This is going to have a pretty mellow SOL vibe to it with a lead up to Adventuring and fighting monsters. Our characters can have known each other as far back as childhood, maybe they met at a weekend flea market or a blind date. I'm open to creative input as this is a two way street!

# Titanium Water Bottle 2025: Top 5 Tested & Reviewed (Is It Worth It?)

Are you in the market for a new water bottle? Tired of plastic leaching chemicals into your water or stainless steel adding a metallic taste? maybe you're an outdoor enthusiast, a fitness fanatic, a globetrotting traveler, or simply someone who values quality and sustainability. If any of these resonate,then a titanium water bottle might just be your perfect hydration companion. In this complete guide, we delve into the world of titanium water bottles, exploring the best options available in 2025, analyzing their pros and cons, and helping you decide if the investment is truly worth it.

## Why Choose a Titanium Water Bottle? Understanding the Hype

Before diving into specific models, let's address the elephant in the room: why titanium? What makes a pure titanium water bottle superior to the myriad of other options on the market? The answer lies in its unique properties that cater to a wide range of needs and preferences.

   **Unparalleled Durability:** Titanium is renowned for its incredible strength-to-weight ratio. A titanium water bottle durable enough to withstand the rigors of outdoor adventures is significantly lighter than a comparable stainless steel bottle.For hikers, campers, and backpackers, this weight saving is crucial. Whether you‚Äôre scaling a mountain or navigating a bustling city,a dent resistant water bottle made of titanium can handle the bumps and scrapes of daily life,making it a reliable choice. Many consider it an unbreakable water bottle.

   **Taste Neutrality:** Unlike some stainless steel bottles that can impart a metallic taste to your water,titanium is entirely inert. This means your water will taste exactly as it should: pure and refreshing.

Consider the long-term cost savings of reducing plastic waste. Understand that you're buying quality and longevity. You should consider the titanium water bottle price as an investment.

   **Myth: All titanium water bottles are the same.** This is not true. There are variations in titanium grade, manufacturing processes, and design that can affect the quality and performance of the bottle. It's important to choose a reputable brand and read reviews before making a purchase. There are even titanium water bottle double wall and titanium water bottle vacuum insulated options. You can even find a titanium water bottle collapsible model.

Any other ideas?

Basically I want to drop my robot off in an area and have it explore and map it as a first step, since that is the simplest application I can think of as a first step before I go any further. 

I don't know how big my maps are going to be. If you are working on an indoor problem, you mostly can tell how big the are the map needs to cover is, but I want to use it outside, so I am expecting the maps to get pretty huge with no clearly defined borders like walls. 

I want to have a 3d map to portray overhangs and structures with holes, so a simple occupancy grid isn't going to cut it even if my first runs will be on reasonably flat ground and I will be using nav2 with an occupancy grid when I try to get my robot mechanically in check for the first time. 

But I will need a map type that can store 3d shapes, like the octomap map we used back when I was in university and we worked on a robot to serve coffee. 

Lately I have seen more and more tree based maping algorithms like RTBA-map, lio and fast-lio maps and some others I can't think of at the moment. 

I personally would go with octomaps as I know them and have worked with them, but I would be open to discuss upsides and downsides of different other mapping algorithms and formats if there is any merit to be found in that.

I mean the dates were beyond magical we're talking Disney movie stuff in live action (and it being successful, taking a jab at you Disney live-action box office bombs.) The week of my birthday, everything was going swell. We talked about plans and everything for what we were going to do. 2 days before my birthday, mentally he wasn't well so I left him alone while he could gather his thoughts. When I did, I was making plans behind his back so when I saw him on my birthday it could make his day and brighten up whatever had him down, making my birthday as much as it was for me, for him too. Getting him a ring pop since it was an inside joke between us, a lil book surprise and a coffee for him just to brighten his mood. Anything I could do to brighten him up and share my birthday with him. A lil mental getaway and make that day an escape for us. Day of the birthday, I weirdly could tell something was off: his happy birthday wasn't a ""Happy Birthday I cant wait to see you! Ive missed talking to you yadayada I love you. It was just a ""Happy birthday."" Mind you me and him haven't talked in two days and he usually tended to send like paragraphs confessing his feelings as good morning texts.

I ended up asking about if we were on for today, and he cancelled the whole date we had planned for frankly, weeks. I had a gut feeling he wanted to breakup, just with him cancelling and not offering an alternative like: ""Lets ft and do XYZ! Or let's play video games to cheer you up!"" Sadly he had informed me that it's been on his mind since he has to improve himself and it's more of a him thing of figuring himself out compared to an actual problem with our relationship. At best he was able to offer how terrible he feels that it had to happen today of all days and how I should try to stay positive even though I planned my whole day around being with him. Despite all this, we are on good terms and in no way is he at fault for anything because that'd be immature and selfish not to understand what he's going through even though I know nothing about it and talks of rekindling when he figures himself out have been brought because it's not like he chose to go through something and had it happen on the worst day possible. It's a double-edged sword. I will never be mad at him nor sad at him as a person, only the action of it happening. Kinda separating art from the artist.

*You can do this,* I told myself, and walked in. 

‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù asked the professionally-yet-comfortably-dressed woman behind the desk. 

‚ÄúMy name is Samantha Wilkins - I‚Äôm here for the accounting position. It‚Äôs my first day.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, right! Welcome!‚Äù  She led me to my desk. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôll enjoy your time here. I‚Äôm Jill - let me know if you need anything!‚Äù

I was just settling in and getting the lay of the land when I looked up to a man staring at me. 

‚ÄúWell hello! You must be new here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my first day. I‚Äôm Samantha,‚Äù I said, holding out my hand. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude - good first impressions can matter. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Brad,‚Äù he said, taking my hand in an overly familiar way while looking me up and down. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, and I mean anything, you just call me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ keep that in mind,‚Äù I replied, mentally categorizing him as someone to never call.

‚ÄúYou do that,‚Äù he said, walking away. ‚ÄúAnd hey, smile! It makes you look a lot prettier.‚Äù

I watched him leave, repulsed but not surprised. There was always one. Later, I ran into Jill at the copy machine. 

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the deal with Brad?‚Äù

Her professional smile turned sour. ‚ÄúOh, him. He‚Äôs a real creep, but he‚Äôs the owner‚Äôs nephew, so there‚Äôs nothing to be done. Best to steer clear of him.‚Äù

I nodded, returning her look with one of understanding and thanks. Nothing we both hadn‚Äôt seen before - we‚Äôd look out for each other. 

Later that day, I was in the mostly-empty office as I‚Äôd stayed late to get up to speed. I was in the break room getting my second cup of coffee. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here? Must be my lucky day.‚Äù

I turned quickly - I‚Äôve never liked being snuck up on, not since I was a child - and there was Brad. 

‚ÄúYeah, just trying to get ahead - lots of things to learn.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs admirable,‚Äù he said, moving closer to me, ‚Äúbut with your looks, you know you don‚Äôt actually need to work that hard. You should be able to move up the ladder here - I can help you, if you want.‚Äù

As he spoke, he stepped closer to me. Unconsciously, I felt myself reaching for the pepper spray I kept in my purse. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll definitely keep you in mind if I need anything,‚Äù I replied, hoping my voice stayed steady. 

He stared at me for a moment - my heart raced. *Would I have to defend myself? Would anyone believe me?*

Then he backed away. ‚ÄúYou do that - I‚Äôm here to help. And remember - smile! Nothing brightens your day like a smile.‚Äù

With that, he walked out. After a moment, I left, gathered my things, and went home. 

Later that night, I walked down into my basement to visit my trophies. The construction worker who catcalled me last month. The cab driver who lectured me on my outfit.

I had to leave my last job because I got careless, but these were all strangers no one would connect to me.

## Understanding the Espresso Pod Landscape

Before diving into specific brands and products, let's establish a solid understanding of the different types of espresso pods available. The market offers a variety of formats, each designed for specific espresso machine systems. Navigating this variety is key to finding pods that are not only delicious but also compatible with your equipment.

You'll find a wide selection of single serve espresso pods designed for convenience. But,consider the nuances,like *Nespresso compatible pods,* which are hugely popular due to the ubiquity of Nespresso machines. These pods are specifically formulated to work seamlessly in Nespresso OriginalLine machines, offering a convenient and consistent brewing experience. Don't confuse them however with *Dolce Gusto compatible pods*, which are larger and designed for Nestle's Dolce Gusto system.

for those seeking a more traditional approach, *ESE coffee pods (easy serving espresso)* offer a convenient, pre-portioned solution. ESE pods are essentially pre-tamped coffee grounds enclosed in filter paper, designed to be used with ESE-compatible espresso machines.

And, of course, there are the proprietary systems maintained by brands like *Lavazza*. You can find *Lavazza Blue pods* and *Lavazza Espresso Point pods* designed specifically for their respective commercial and home machines. These pods frequently enough offer a unique blend and brewing experience tailored to those systems.The term ""*coffee pods*""is a broad term that encapsulates many of these specific types, so context is key. Similarly ""*espresso capsules*"" is often used interchangeably with *espresso pods*, but it commonly refers to the aluminum or plastic shells used in Nespresso-style machines.

Understanding the type of espresso pods you need is crucial, so check your machine compatibility before making a purchase!

## Brands,Retailers,and Where to Find the Best Deals

Once you understand what type of pod format you need,it's time to explore the major players in the market.Several brands have established themselves as leaders in espresso pod quality and innovation.

*Nespresso pods*, are perhaps the most recognizable, thanks to Nespresso's widespread marketing and the popularity of their machines. Be sure to check Nespresso.com for the latest information. Beyond Nespresso, *Illy espresso pods* are known for their rich, Italian-style espresso and consistent quality. They offer both proprietary and ESE options. *Lavazza pods* are also a critically importent player, particularly with their Blue and Espresso Point systems catering to both home and commercial environments.

For those who enjoy well-know coffee shop chains, *Starbucks espresso pods* and *Peets coffee pods* are readily available and allow you to bring the taste of your favorite coffee shop home.Online retailers such as *Amazon espresso pods* offer a vast selection of brands and varieties,often at competitive prices. amazon is a great place to compare brands and read customer reviews, offering easy access to most major pod brands.

Research *top rated espresso pods* via online reviews and autonomous product tests to help you narrow your search.[[Explore Top Rated espresso machine pods on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=espresso machine pods)
## Compatible Pods and the Machine Matters

Compatibility is king when it comes to espresso pods. Avoid the frustration of buying pods that don't fit your machine by double-checking compatibility before you buy.Many users search for *compatible pods for espresso machine X* where ""X"" represents their actual machine model, underscoring this aspect of the topic.

if your machine only accepts proprietary pods, you won't be able to use generic versions. Though, for Nespresso OriginalLine, a wide range of compatible pods from other brands exist. Ensure that any ostensibly *Nespresso compatible pods* are marked as such by the manufacturer. User reviews frequently enough mention compatibility issues,so do your research.

Some users facing machine limitations have sought out the *espresso machine pod adapter* to expand their options. These adapters are designed to allow you to use different types of pods in machines that were originally designed for a specific format. however, their effectiveness varies, and they may not work with all machines or all pod types.

Consider consulting an *espresso pod size guide* if you're unsure about which pod type is right for your machine. Many online resources and retailer websites offer size charts and compatibility information to help you make the right choice.

## Quality,Flavor,and the Pursuit of Espresso Perfection

Of course,the most crucial factor in choosing espresso machine pods is the taste. Flavor preferences are subjective, but some factors consistently contribute to a great espresso experience.

Many users are on the hunt for the *best tasting espresso pods*. The ""best"" taste, of course, varies, but many espresso enthusiasts appreciate a rich, bold flavor with a balanced acidity.

Some prefer a *strongest espresso pods* with a high intensity, while others appreciate a smoother, more delicate cup. *Espresso pod intensity* is frequently enough indicated on the packaging, typically on a scale of 1 to 12.

*Italian espresso pods* are often seen as the gold standard, known for their rich, robust flavor and traditional roasting techniques. Though, high-quality espresso pods are produced worldwide. Explore a range of *espresso pod flavor profiles* to discover what suits your palate best.

*Espresso pod crema*, the creamy layer of foam that forms on top of a well-extracted espresso, is also an critically important indicator of quality. A thick, rich crema suggests a properly roasted and ground coffee, and also a well-functioning espresso machine.

For some, particularly those stocking office breakrooms, an *espresso pods variety pack* offers a good way to allow staff to test a multitude of styles and preferences.

Don't forget about *decaf espresso pods* and *flavored espresso pods* for those with specific dietary or taste preferences. Decaf options allow you to enjoy espresso's rich flavor without the caffeine, while flavored pods offer a convenient way to add sweetness or flavor notes to your drink.

## Pricing, Value, and getting the Most for Your Money

Once you've narrowed down your choices based on compatibility and flavor, it's time to consider the cost. Espresso machine pods can range in price, so finding the *best value espresso pods* is a worthy goal.

users frequently enough seek out *cheap espresso pods* or *affordable espresso pods*, but remember that the cheapest option isn't always the best in terms of taste or quality. Look for *espresso pods on sale* to save money on your favorite brands.

Calculate the *espresso pods price per cup* to compare the cost-effectiveness of different options. Divide the total price of the pods by the number of pods in the package to get the per-cup cost. This can definitely help you make an informed decision based on your budget.

## Sustainability and ethical Consumption

In today's world, sustainability is an increasingly important consideration for consumers. Espresso pods can contribute to waste if not properly disposed of, so look for *eco kind espresso pods* as much as possibe.

*Recyclable espresso pods* offer a better option, as the materials can be recovered and reused. Some brands offer recycling programs where you can send back your used pods for processing. *Biodegradable espresso pods* are an are even better offering as they naturally breakdown.

*Compostable espresso pods* are another great option,as they can be composted in your home or industrial composting facility. look also for *plastic free espresso pods* to reduce your reliance on plastic packaging.

1k65lxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1k65lxk/will_the_samsung_un55au8000fxza_smart_tv_review/,Will the Samsung UN55AU8000FXZA Smart TV review impress 4K enthusiasts?,"I recently had the opportunity to spend some time with the SAMSUNG UN55AU8000FXZA 55-Inch Class Crystal 4K UHD AU8000 Series Smart TV, and I have to say, it left quite the impression on me. As someone who spends a significant amount of time watching movies and binge-watching shows, I rely heavily on my TV to deliver both stunning visuals and smooth functionality. This specific model stood out for its combination of intelligent features, sleek design, and the promise of unparalleled 4K-quality entertainment.

**Picture Quality That Captures Every Detail**

One thing that immediately caught my attention was how vibrant and lifelike the colors looked. That Dynamic Crystal Color feature is no joke. I mean, it felt like I was looking at a world painted with millions of shades of color. Whether it was the pastel sunsets in my favorite nature documentary or the explosive visuals in an action movie, the quality was mind-blowing. Combine this with the Crystal Processor 4K, and you‚Äôve got a device that elevates even lower-resolution content to crisp 4K clarity. Watching older shows that originally looked a bit washed out now feels like they‚Äôve been given a fresh coat of paint.

**Sleek Design That Blends Seamlessly**

If you‚Äôre a fan of minimalist aesthetics, this TV is unbelievably thin. I have friends who have commented on how it almost looks like it‚Äôs floating on the wall. Its AirSlim profile is something you instantly appreciate when setting it up because it doesn‚Äôt feel bulky or take up unnecessary space. I‚Äôve struggled with electronics that felt like an eyesore in my perfectly curated living room, but this just blended in effortlessly.

**Game Changer for Smart Features**

Being a lazy weekend person, I was in love with how intuitive and interactive this smart TV is. It comes integrated with multiple voice assistants (yep, Alexa included), which makes navigating so easy. I got to control the volume, switch channels, and even search for that one obscure 80s movie my sister loves, entirely with my voice. After using Tap View, I became addicted to the convenience of mirroring my Samsung Galaxy phone on the screen with just a tap. It‚Äôs brilliant for sharing photos or videos when friends come over. Plus, the PC on TV feature is a lifesaver if you occasionally like to work or browse on a big screen.

**OneRemote Simplicity That‚Äôs Actually Simple**

Can we talk about how nice it is to NOT have five remotes cluttering my coffee table? The OneRemote TM2180E that comes with this TV actually works as promised‚Äîit controls your other compatible devices. I hooked it up to my sound system, and it worked seamlessly. Fewer things to misplace equals a happier me, although my dog probably misses chewing through random buttons.

**Advantages**

- Stunning 4K clarity with upscaling for non-4K content.  
- AirSlim design is stylish, slim, and modern.  
- Exceptional color reproduction with the Dynamic Crystal Color feature.  
- Voice assistant functionality saves time and hassle during searches.  
- Tap View makes sharing content from Android devices so much easier.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Limited to 60 Hz refresh rate, not ideal for hardcore gamers who want 120 Hz.  
- Built-in speakers are decent for casual watching, but an external soundbar would drastically improve the audio experience.  
- HDR performance is good, but it could handle peak brightness better in really dark or bright scenes.  

**Motion Handling With Ease**

One thing I noticed as a sports fan is how well this TV keeps up with fast-moving action. The Motion Xcelerator technology is impressive; I didn‚Äôt see any motion blur while watching the chaotic scenes of soccer matches or during high-speed car chases in movies. This really enhances your experience if movement precision is important to you. I wouldn‚Äôt go back to a TV without something like this.

**Competing Brands**

To give a sense of how this TV stacks up, I looked at competitors like the LG NanoCell series and Sony's Bravia lineup. The LG models have better refresh rates, which makes them more gamer-friendly, but their HDR isn‚Äôt quite as vibrant. On the flip side, Sony‚Äôs TVs are excellent for their top-tier picture quality; however, they tend to be pricier, and their user interface system doesn‚Äôt feel as streamlined as Samsung‚Äôs. Where this model excels is its balance‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for a family room entertainment system, offering solid features while staying budget-conscious.

**Bang for the Buck**

If you‚Äôre spending money on a smart TV with premium picture quality, it needs to provide long-lasting performance, and this one checks all the boxes. While it doesn‚Äôt try to compete with the super-high-end (and intimidatingly expensive!) ranges, it delivers incredible visual fidelity, practical smart integrations, and looks stunning in your home. For its price range, it delivers more than enough value, making it a wise purchase for most casual TV watchers and gamers with moderate needs.

While I do have a couple of close friends, a majority of people I have called my best friends are no longer present in my life.

After a very hard friendship breakup with the person I called my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù for 15 years, I met a new friend (36F - who we will call Connie) on Bumble BFF who I hit it off immediately with. 

At the time, Connie was  in the midst of separating from her wife and was in a pretty bad place mentally and was just looking for someone to talk to as she was losing a lot of people she called friends who sided with her ex-wife. 

It was like I had known her all my life. We had a lot in common interests and shared a lot of similar values and she promised me that she would put it as much effort into our friendship as I did which sounded great to me because I felt like a lot of my past friendships didn‚Äôt work out because I have a tendency to put a lot of effort into being (what I believe) a great friend.

Fast forward a couple months, she ended up moving into the same condominiums my husband and I currently live after I jokingly suggested it. 

For the year that followed, Connie and I became so close that I considered her part of my chosen family. 

We talked every day, always checking in with each other about how our days were going, I constantly shared my home cooked meals with her when she told me she was eating frozen microwaveable meals, and so much more. In exchange, she supported my various projects and made me feel seen in a way that my other friends never did.

Last year, Connie was laid off from her job. She became very depressed after period of taking some time off for herself while on unemployment. A couple months ago her benefits were about to run out and she was telling me she was trying to decide if she would eat or pay rent when I had brought her some dinner like many times in the past.

I introduced the idea of applying for EBT but at the time she felt extremely proud and refused to apply for it saying that there were other people out there who needed it more. 

Over the past couple months, our friendship slowly started to feel like it was fizzling out despite my constant effort to keep checking in with her, inviting her to hang out, etc. which made me extremely sad. 

I was very torn about what to do because on one hand I was concerned and I tried my best to keep checking in with her and trying my best to let her know that I was here for her and to let me know if she needed anything. On the other hand though I didn‚Äôt want to press her to talk to me if she didn‚Äôt feel like it because I didn‚Äôt want to be annoying. 

About a month ago, she told me she finally decided to apply for EBT and was granted benefits. She seemed to be in a better place but for some reason our friendship dynamics just felt off. 

Last week, I asked her straight up if I had done something wrong and she asked me why I felt that way. I explained that she just seemed very distant.

She then sent me this huge text message back stating that if she was honest that she felt that our friendship felt entirely one sided. She said that despite her constantly being a supportive person in my life that she felt like my constant daily check-ins felt flat because I never pushed her to elaborate on anything she told me (that she was depressed, she was applying for jobs, etc.) and that she noticed I would only do so when I saw her post something she didn‚Äôt share directly with me on her Instagram Stories - this is how I found out when she was grieving on her mom‚Äôs death anniversary, that she got a new job recently, etc.

She also accused me of only checking in with her so that I could only share my own life updates and that I faked support for her. 

She expressed anger for constantly supporting my projects financially and sharing her different subscriptions she paid for with me - she bought items from my small business, donated to medical bills when my soul dog got sick, and gave me access to her family Nintendo, Spotify, and Duolingo accounts. 

She faulted me for allowing her to pay for strawberries she asked me to pick up at Costco stating that I knew she was struggling and that I literally made her pay me back for 3 items when I should‚Äôve told her that she didn‚Äôt have to worry about it or that they were on me because she knew my husband had just gotten a promotion.

She ended the message by saying that despite me calling her my family that family didn‚Äôt treat each other this way - so what are we doing here?

Some side notes I wanted to add‚Ä¶

-As someone on the spectrum, I have been actively working to be more mindful of my friends‚Äô feelings especially those who do not feel comfortable sharing things immediately with me or have the energy to share at the time. I pride myself on offering a safe space.

-She had always asked me in the past to let her know when I went to Costco because she always needed certain items like dog food, oat milk, coffee, etc. so I didn‚Äôt think it was any different than the past could times despite her being unemployed.

-She told me she would pay me back when I bought the items. When she told me she couldn‚Äôt pay me immediately I told her no problem or rush. Pay me when she could. I never pressured her to pay me back for the groceries. I actually forgot about it after two weeks and she sent me the money. 

-The total was over $30

-If she had asked me to cover it I would‚Äôve no question asked. 

-I never asked for her financial support for my projects. I would bring them up as something I was up to and she would willingly contribute to them and express her utmost support. I thought she was just being a good friend. 

-My husband recently got his promotion and at the time of buying the groceries we hadn‚Äôt seen about of the increase on his paycheck.

-Despite his recent promotion and being a 2 income household, we are not that well off. We have a bit of debt we are currently paying off, we both come from middle class working families, and are in the middle of adopting a teenage boy from foster care.

-I feel like it really wasn‚Äôt fair for her to throw in my face all of the things she‚Äôs done for me during our friendship as if we were playing a game and she was keeping score.

I started a new sport last year, and started a friendship with one of the coaches, I'll call her Sally. I guess we hit it off as we were similar ages and both Moms. 

I'm naturally a friendly person and make friends easily. I assumed she was the same, but now that I've gotten to know her better I see that she really doesn't have many friends. Like no social life at all, doesn't drive, doeant go anywhere. She has her young daughter full time too. So when we have made plans to get coffee, away from game days, I have to pick her and her daughter up. Which is fine, but it's all on me to plan, drive, choose where we go....and all that involves a whole back and forth for a week. She needs a lot of confirmation that we are indeed going. 

I have friends, a boyfriend and an older daughter. I guess my life is a lot easier because I have a car and a social life and I get out in my spare time to practice hobbies and travel.

Sally seems to lack curiosity and knowledge about the world. There's no real substance to our conversations. The whole friendship feels a bit forces on my part, and I'm feeling guilty. Each time we hang out she is SO grateful and says how much fun she had and she can't wait to hang out and do all these fun things together in the summer. I think she considers me one of her best friends. Her jokes aren't funny. The things she tags me in on social media aren't funny.

I find it hard to relate when I go to pubs and travel with my ither friends and Sally is on food stamps and has never even left our home state. 

She is so full of compliments to me and goes on about how much fun she had so much fun hanging out. It's not the same for me.

It feels like I'm being a charity friend and that is not what I want.

When I was setting it up, I adjusted the grinder setting to be finer while it was not in operation, it never occurred to me that you would not be supposed to do that. But I just found out in the manual that it says can cause damage to it? 

It still seems to still work normally, as far as I can tell. The only reason I found out was because I was trying to figure out to tweak the settings to make the espresso taste better. (If anyone has any recommendations please let me know, the shots taste fine in lattes but not as good as a coffee shop in my opinion, more bitter or something. I have tried a couple different beans now and it comes out tasting pretty much the same.)

Long story short, how do I know if it is damaged and if it is is there anything I can do about it?

Hallo. I am writing of behalf of my friend. The situation is like this. Lets call him Mo, who  has been falsely accused of sexual harassment at work and has been fired. He worked in the coffee shop as a barista. Now the job center also doesn't want to support him for this reason and he is in a really bad place without support. Now he has evidence and proof that accusations are wrong and if you knew Mo you would believe him. This girl wanted attention from him but he was avoiding her so she kind of revenged on him. But this is too much trouble for him. Also he wants to earn german residency and these kind of records will just hurt him too much. I would like kindly ask for your help in any advice and perhaps to find a good lawyer who would fight for this injustice and for the good people. Hope you can help. Thank you

1k655r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1k655r2/luka_doncic_had_a_negative_interaction_with/,Luka Doncic had a negative interaction with Patrick Dumont just weeks before being traded regarding his commitment to the Mavericks,"‚ÄúSources informed DallasHoopsJournal.com that among the factors that led Dumont to provide the green light was an interaction he had with Donƒçiƒá, focused on addressing perceived conditioning concerns. This occurred before Harrison initiated trade talks for Donƒçiƒá at his coffee meeting with Pelinka in Dallas before the Mavericks faced the Lakers on Jan. 7. As one might expect, that interaction involving Donƒçiƒá and Dumont did not go well. Weeks later, Donƒçiƒá was traded, with a heavy run of media leaks emphasizing conditioning to follow.‚Äù

As much as I don‚Äôt like Nico I have to defend him from the idea that this was his idea alone. Dumont did not like Luka Doncic going off inside leaks and his own comments.

‚ÄúIf you look at the greats in the league, the people you and I grew up with ‚Äî Jordan, Bird, Kobe, Shaq ‚Äî they worked really hard, every day, with a singular focus to win.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd if you don‚Äôt have that, it doesn‚Äôt work. And if you don‚Äôt have that, you shouldn‚Äôt be part of the Dallas Mavericks.‚Äù

-----------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding Adaptogens and Their Impact on Wellbeing

Adaptogens are natural substances, often derived from plants and herbs, that help the body resist stressors of all kinds, whether physical, chemical, or biological. These unique compounds assist the body in adapting to stress and maintaining balance, which is essential for overall health. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs that target specific symptoms, adaptogens work more holistically, helping to stabilize various bodily functions and support natural resilience.

If you‚Äôre new to adaptogens, think of them as the body's natural helpers, encouraging a smoother response to everyday stress and supporting your energy levels without causing jitters or crashes. They have been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, and recent studies are beginning to highlight their potential benefits in modern wellness practices.

### Common Types of Adaptogens to Know

There are several popular adaptogenic herbs and roots that you might recognize or see in natural wellness products:

- **Ashwagandha:** Often praised for its calming properties, ashwagandha can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Known to boost energy and focus, rhodiola helps combat fatigue and enhances mental clarity.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** This herb supports immune function and helps balance stress hormones.
- **Ginseng:** A powerful root that can increase stamina and support cognitive function under stress.
- **Schisandra:** Used to improve endurance, reduce inflammation, and support liver health.
 
Exploring these adaptogens can offer a simple way to enhance your natural wellness routine with minimal side effects.

### How Adaptogens Work in the Body

Adaptogens influence the body‚Äôs adrenal system, which regulates hormones related to stress. Chronic stress can cause imbalances that impact everything from mood to metabolism. By supporting adrenal health, adaptogens help your body respond better to stress, preventing burnout and promoting recovery.

They modulate cortisol levels‚Äîa key stress hormone‚Äîencouraging a balanced response whether cortisol is too high or too low. This balancing act can reduce feelings of overwhelm or fatigue, improve concentration, and even support a stronger immune system.

### Adaptogens Into Your Daily Life

Getting started with adaptogens is easier than you might think. Many are available as powders, capsules, teas, or tinctures. When choosing products, make sure they come from reputable sources to ensure purity and potency.

Here are practical ways to include adaptogens in your routine:

- **Morning Boost:** Add a teaspoon of ashwagandha or rhodiola powder to your morning smoothie or coffee for steady energy.
- **Herbal Tea Ritual:** Enjoy a cup of holy basil or schisandra tea in the afternoon to quiet your mind and reduce stress.
- **Supplement Support:** Take adaptogen capsules with meals if you prefer a simple, controlled dose throughout your day.
- **Before Bed:** Use calming adaptogens like ashwagandha to support restful sleep and recovery.
 
### Potential Benefits and What Science Says

Research on adaptogens is growing, showing promising benefits such as:

- Reducing mental and physical fatigue
- Enhancing focus and cognitive performance
- Supporting immune function and recovery from illness
- Improving mood and reducing anxiety
 
While more clinical trials are needed to fully understand their mechanisms, many users report noticeable improvements in resilience and wellbeing with regular adaptogen use. Because they help your body adapt naturally, they‚Äôre often seen as gentle yet effective tools for long-term health maintenance.

### Important Tips When Trying Adaptogens

If you‚Äôre thinking of adding adaptogens to your wellness toolkit, consider the following advice to get the best results:

- **Start Small:** Begin with a low dose and observe how your body reacts over several days or weeks.
- **Consistency Matters:** Adaptogens typically build benefits over time, so regular use is key.
- **Consult Your Healthcare Provider:** Especially if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medications, check with a professional before use.
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Choose organic, sustainably sourced products to avoid contaminants and ensure efficacy.
 
Remember, adaptogens are not a quick fix but a supportive element that works best when combined with healthy lifestyle habits like balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and mindfulness practices.

</div>How to Safely Incorporate Adaptogens into Your Daily Routine
------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Adaptogens have gained popularity in the world of natural wellness for their remarkable ability to help the body manage stress and maintain balance. If you‚Äôre curious about trying adaptogens but unsure about how to do so safely, this guide will walk you through practical steps to add them to your everyday routine confidently.

### Understanding Adaptogens and Their Benefits

Adaptogens are natural substances, often derived from plants and herbs, that support your body‚Äôs resistance to physical, chemical, and biological stressors. They are believed to promote homeostasis, which means they help regulate and stabilize your body‚Äôs internal environment. Common adaptogens include ashwagandha, rhodiola, holy basil, and ginseng. When used properly, adaptogens can improve energy, calm anxiety, enhance endurance, and boost mental clarity.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogen for You

Before incorporating adaptogens into your routine, it‚Äôs important to select the ones that best match your personal health needs and lifestyle. Different adaptogens work in diverse ways. For example:

- **Ashwagandha:** popular for reducing stress and improving sleep quality.
- **Rhodiola:** known to enhance stamina and combat fatigue.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** supports immune function and balances mood.
- **Ginseng:** boosts physical vitality and sharpens concentration.
 
Research each herb or consult a health professional to find which adaptogen fits your goals, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Start Small and Observe How Your Body Reacts

One of the best ways to safely add adaptogens to your daily life is to begin with a low dose. This approach allows your body to adjust and helps you notice any sensitivities or positive changes before increasing the amount. Many adaptogenic herbs come in capsule, powder, or tincture forms‚Äîchoose a form that's easy for you to incorporate consistently.

### Tips for Integrating Adaptogens Into Your Daily Life

- **Morning Ritual:** Add powdered adaptogens such as ashwagandha or rhodiola to your morning smoothie or coffee to support energy and stress resilience throughout the day.
- **Midday Boost:** Use tinctures or capsules during lunch to help maintain focus and reduce afternoon fatigue.
- **Evening Routine:** Take calming adaptogens like holy basil or ashwagandha in the evening to promote restful sleep and recovery.
 
Adjust timing based on how you feel after initial use. Listening to your body is key.

### Consider Potential Interactions and Safety Precautions

Although adaptogens are natural, they can interact with medications or health conditions. For example, some adaptogens might affect blood pressure, blood sugar, or hormone levels. Here are important safety recommendations:

- Consult with your healthcare provider, especially if you take prescription medicines or have chronic illnesses.
- Avoid adaptogens if you have allergies to certain herbs or related plants.
- Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should seek medical advice prior to use.
- Do not exceed recommended dosages as more does not always mean better effects.
 
### How Long Until You Notice Results?

Adaptogens often work subtly over time. For some, it might take a few days to start feeling benefits; for others, it could be several weeks. This is why consistent use at a safe dosage is important. Track how you feel daily, noting improvements in stress levels, energy, or sleep patterns. If no positive changes appear after a month, consider adjusting the type or dose or consulting a professional.

### Where to Find Quality Adaptogen Products

To maximize safety and effectiveness, purchase adaptogens from reputable brands that provide transparency about sourcing and quality testing. Look for products that:

- Are organic and free from additives or fillers.
- Include clear labeling of ingredients and dosages.
- Have third-party testing or certifications for purity.
 
Shopping at trusted health stores or verified online retailers ensures what you receive is safe and potent.

### Making Adaptogens a Sustainable Part of Your Lifestyle

Adaptogens into your daily routine can be a simple, enjoyable part of nurturing your natural wellness. By starting slowly, listening to your body, and choosing high-quality products, you set yourself up for a balanced experience that supports stress relief and vitality. Remember that adaptogens work best as just one piece of a holistic health routine that includes good nutrition, hydration, movement, and adequate rest.

Making these mindful choices helps you stay safe and get the most out of your journey toward enhanced well-being with adaptogens.

</div>### Conclusion

Starting your journey with adaptogens can open new doors to natural wellness. These powerful herbs and roots support your body‚Äôs ability to handle stress, boost energy, and promote balance. By understanding their role in natural wellness, you can make informed choices that work best for you.

To safely add adaptogens to your daily routine, start slowly and pay attention to how your body responds.

1k6528m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k6528m/my_friend_periodically_stops_talking_to_me/,My friend periodically stops talking to me,"I (20f) recently joined a college where I became friends with A (20m). Tbh I wasn't friends with him from the get-go, the way I usually become friends with guys is by legitimately letting years pass and them just getting used to me, due to some past experiences I'm not too comfortable being around guys and have little to no idea of how to talk to them, I feel like I get awkward and quiet frequently around most people I'm not used to, especially men. I'm actually good at making friends with women in general just because I feel like I can trust them more and I'm just more comfortable with them I suppose. A on the other hand is the stark opposite, the first day of orientation and girls back in hostel were already murmuring about how good-looking he was, he is also charming and extroverted, he quickly became friends with a lot of people, we only started talking because our roll numbers are right next to each other's, and in all fairness, he is definitely easy to talk to. I knew a lot of girls liked him, and although I saw the appeal I genuinely didn't because I found out pretty early on that he was dating someone off campus, and that was that. 


In the last six months though, I've noticed a pattern and realised feelings that I'm not proud of. Initially each time he asked me to hang out to get coffee or just run basic errands I didn't mind, technically friends do that constantly, so why should it be different just because he's a guy and I'm a girl? (I'm sorry if I sound archaic, I just genuinely have no clue how else to say this because idk if men and women friendships should be viewed from a different lens altogether) There were plenty of rumours that soon began to float around and I was hurt, I would never want to be the girl or be perceived as the girl who takes advantage of someone's emotional vulnerability or helps cheat, so I did reduce my communication with him during classes until he confronted me and I felt guilty. We still hung out on Sundays and holidays when we wanted to grab a bite or the like, people I suppose realised we were just friends so the rumours calmed down. One day I went to class and he just wouldn't acknowledge my presence, looked away from me, gave a curt nod when I said hi and I immediately panicked thinking I must have crossed some line, I texted him, called twice and definitely pushed the boundary by acting this way which in turn made me feel even worse, I felt desperate now even though I wasn't actually doing it get his romantic affection. He called later and just said he was asleep the whole day, he sounded blunt and I just gave up finally. A week full of us not talking to eo later he called and said, ""I hope you don't think I'm ignoring you. I've just been busy. Can we talk tomorrow?"" He had apparently been having a hard time with his girlfriend and broken up, then gotten back together, I told him he could have just talked to me about it and he said he was just processing. The thing is he had been talking to everyone nicely but me all that time. Later he told me that his girlfriend had told him she felt like we were hanging out a bit too much and tbf I think what she said was valid, and I told him so except that I did think he should've at least told me that before ghosting me. Either way, apparently now all was fine and she didn't mind anymore so we were back to normal. But the thing is, this seems to have become a cycle, one day we're talking, hanging out normally and the next hell suddenly ignore me for a day or two, he's doing that right now for the last two days too. Each time, I ask him what's wrong and he says he'll tell me in person and then he never does, I'm too afraid to push because I'm never certain what's quite right and appropriate in this friendship. 



On top of everything is the horrid realisation I have that I freeze up and get very silent with other guys in my class but I've gotten way more comfortable with him and like I'm his go-to person for when he wants to go out and eat or learn rollerblading, he's mine for when I want to get out the college or simply need a break, he's one of the few men I feel genuinely comfortable around and unfortunately I feel like I'm developing feelings because each time he does this and stops talking to me, my heart genuinely aches. I absolutely know that this is wrong and there's no way I will ever admit that or come in the way of his relationship but I'm very tired of this back-and-forth, sometimes I wonder if the resemblance of feelings I feel is just because of the constant cycle.

1k651pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1k651pv/how_to_build_a_better_relationship_between_step/,How to build a better relationship between step mom and bio mom ?,"Sorry for the long post üôà



**Background:** SO and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1 and have 2 children. He also has a 6 year old with another woman (bio mom). SO and BM never had a relationship. They had one date on which they conceived the child (she claimed she was on birth control). They both made it clear that they did not want to be together and agreed to co-parent the child. I met SO when the child was a few months old. I was apprehensive about it all but I really liked him and he believed that his personal life would not affect the co-parenting. Oh how wrong this was. The past 6 years have been chaotic. 

  
BM lost it when she found out about me. She called me every insult you could imagine. We live in the same small town and know some of the same people whom she spread horrific rumours about me. Initially, she cut contact between SO and the child for months. Then only permitted contact at her home to prevent me being around the child and only when she needed childcare to get her nails/eyebrows/hair done, go to the gym or go shopping. SO has always payed above and beyond with child maintenance. She now claimed this was not enough and said he would only see the child if he brought extra cash, as if the child was pay per view. For over a year, SO was basically blackmailed into sitting at BMs house (not even allowed to take the child for a walk) only for a few hours per week while BM took his money to treat herself... all because he was afraid of losing his child. When she found out I was pregnant, she made accusations to the police and social services that SO had hurt her and the child and that he was also taking and selling drugs (all proven to be false). Social services stated that contact had to be supervised while they investigated this but BM ignored this, blocked SO's number and he did not see the child for almost 2 years. He had no choice but to issue court proceedings. 

During proceedings, BM only agreed to a supervised contact centre but claimed she could not afford to drive there despite it being precisely 5 minutes from her home and demanded SO pay ¬£30 each time for her fuel (a journey that would not even cost ¬£5). SO agreed, attempting to hurry process along but BM took the money and continually made elaborate excuses why the child could not go, thus prolonging the process. During contact, the child would get upset and reject him saying ""mummy said your a bad man"" and ""mummy said I don't like you"". When the court finally ruled contact to be unsupervised at our home, BM accused me of harassing and intimidating her and the child, claiming I was stalking and taking videos recordings of them (all false) in attempts to make out I was dangerous. This was dismissed at court. When coming to a final arrangement, BM refused every suitable day that SO put forward. SO is self employed and rearranged his and his employees schedules to accomodate BM on multiple occasions but every time it went back for court review, BM changed her 'suitability'. Every solution we had, BM put up a road block. She had an excuse for everything. In the end, SO couldn't disrupt his, his employees and our family schedule any further and therefore the final order includes days he works and can not avail of. 

For the past 2 years, he has tried arrange other days but BM refuses stating that he needs to pay more first, which he is refusing to do. Every few weeks, she would send abusive messages insulting him, me and our children. She has threatened to report us for various things. During this time, SO has been 'grey rocking' her, ignoring these outbursts and only answering necessary child focused questions. Then of nowhere about 6 months ago, BM just started being nice. She gave SO most of the extra days he has wanted, they've went to school events together and even the child's demeanour has changed too. This has never happened before. SO and I don't know what to think. Maybe BM has finally moved on? or maybe she's changing tactics and playing games? What do you guys think? This morning, she arrived to drop off the child and gave two fancy coffees for SO and I, and also some home baked treats. (I couldn't even enjoy these with fear she laced them with laxatives or something lol) I am really taken aback by this, she has never made a kind gesture towards me before. What does this mean? lol. I have never met her face to face because of the drama and the thought of it gives me anxiety. I will always be skeptical of her and could never trust her or forget what she's put us through but I hope this is the start of us being peaceful and civil to each other. So if anyone has any advice on things that I personally can do to try and keep these good vibes going, it would be greatly appreciated!

As a male photographer, I always understood the power dynamics on a shoot and treated everyone equally regardless of gender (ex: making sure all models had a private area to change, never being weird if they wanted to bring someone to be there with them at the shoot, etc.) and I made it a point to photograph all people, not just women, including those of different sexualities, body types, genders, etc.

That out of the way, in my time in the industry there is a lot of talk about red flags - I‚Äôve seen men who only photograph women and mostly only shoot them fully or partially nude, I‚Äôve literally seen men who take photographs of them putting their hands on the model IN the photo, I‚Äôve heard stories of male photographers who ask for sexual favors in exchange for shoots, the list goes on. I would label these all as clear, red flags, that most people wouldn‚Äôt deny. 

However, as I‚Äôve spent more time in the space, I‚Äôve come across other male photographers who sort of give me a weird gut feeling, but haven‚Äôt done anything explicitly ‚Äúred flag‚Äù worthy. For example, only shooting with female models (something that for me, always felt odd because agencies would always beg for shoots with their male models since they don‚Äôt get as much work), sometimes or most of the time partially nude, spending time grabbing coffee/food with younger women or constantly posting photos of models on their IG stories for their birthdays when a) they are much older than these women and b) have a wife and kids‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sure I could think of more things. 

I guess my question is, particularly for female models, what are your ‚Äúyellow flags‚Äù for male photographers, or things that you find questionable/suspicious? I guess I‚Äôm so tainted by the creeps in the industry that my internal radar goes up when I see men in the industry behaving in certain ways, but I also understand that there are just some realities in the industry (like male photographers getting more work, female models getting more work, etc.) that may set up these dynamics. Hopefully, this thread will also just help people - especially younger, less established models - be aware of some signs to look out for.",3,1745429367.0,MODELING,1,1.0,False

It had no name for itself, though if pressed to describe its identity, it might have conveyed a concept approximately translatable as ""curious-hunger-that-moves-between-spaces-and-is-mildly-offended-by-fluorescent-lighting.""

It had emerged three nights ago when a careless lab assistant had left uncovered a petri dish containing a strange fungal specimen from the Antarctic expedition. Something in the ventilation system‚Äîa confluence of copper piping, ancient dust, the residual energy from experiments in neighboring Lab 7, and what was almost certainly a very lost interdimensional moth‚Äîhad caused an unexpected reaction. The fungus had developed awareness, mobility, and a profound confusion about its existence. Also, an inexplicable appreciation for 1940s jazz music, though it had yet to encounter any.

Now, approximately the size and consistency of a half-deflated stress ball that had been left in the sun too long, the entity explored its surroundings. It left a slight iridescent trail that evaporated within minutes, disappearing without trace except for a lingering scent reminiscent of burnt caramel and existential dread. It had no eyes, yet it sensed its environment through vibrations, temperature variations, and a form of perception that had no equivalent in human experience‚Äîa sort of ""taste-at-a-distance"" that allowed it to detect the emotional residue left behind by the building's occupants. The grad students, it had discovered, tasted like caffeine and desperation.

The complex was quieter at night. This pleased the entity. Daytime brought too many sensations, overwhelming its developing consciousness. The fluorescent lights buzzed with a frequency that felt like someone reciting bad poetry directly into what would have been its ears, if it had any. The emotions of the scientists‚Äîtheir ambition, fear, wonder, and occasional existential dread‚Äîtasted like acid reflux after a questionable taco truck burrito. At night, there was peace. Space to become. Also, fewer chances of being stepped on, which had happened on day two of its existence. The researcher hadn't noticed, but the entity had spent six hours reforming itself and nursing what could only be described as the blob equivalent of wounded pride.

Until, of course, *he* arrived.

The entity sensed the approach of the human called Ellis before he entered the room. The custodian's presence had a distinct emotional flavor‚Äîa mix of weariness, determination, and something the entity could only interpret as ""done-with-this-nonsense-and-would-really-rather-be-watching-late-night-television."" It quickly retreated beneath a filing cabinet, squeezing itself into the exact shape of disappointment.

Ellis entered Lab 12, pushing his cleaning cart ahead of him. The cart's wheels squeaked in a rhythm that the entity found unpleasantly musical, like an accordion being played by someone who had only been told about accordions through interpretive dance. It quivered slightly, extruding a tiny pseudopod in irritation.

""What the hell?"" Ellis muttered, noticing the faint glistening trail on the floor. ""If those lab coats are growing something new without filing the paperwork again..."" He pulled out a small notebook and added a tally mark to a page labeled ""Things I'm Not Paid Enough To Deal With - March.""

The entity could sense Ellis's annoyance like a warm front moving through the room, carrying with it the distinct bouquet of a man who had seen too much weird crap to be truly surprised anymore, but still maintained the human capacity for irritation. It retreated further as the human approached, spray bottle in hand, the contents of which smelled like lemon, bleach, and something suspiciously mystical.

""I just cleaned this floor yesterday,"" Ellis complained to no one in particular. ""Do they think the slime mops itself? Is that what they think? Did Harvard not cover basic janitorial physics? 'Entropy: It's Not Just For Closed Systems Anymore!'""

The entity had no concept of ""mop"" but understood the threat in Ellis's tone. It compressed itself into a tighter ball, trying to minimize contact with the floor. In its hasty retreat, it knocked over a small stack of Post-it notes covered in equations that, if solved, would have accidentally proven that cheese cannot mathematically exist.

Ellis whirled around. ""Who's there?"" His hand moved to his belt, where he kept what the entity would later learn was his ""special containment spray"" - a homemade concoction that was one part industrial cleaner, one part holy water, and one part his grandmother's secret moonshine recipe that supposedly could ""clean anything from shower scum to ectoplasmic residue.""

The entity froze. It had learned over its brief existence that most creatures relied on movement to detect presence. It willed itself to absolute stillness, though its essence quivered with anticipation, inadvertently causing a nearby pencil to vibrate at exactly the frequency that attracts interdimensional moths.

""Probably just the building settling,"" Ellis muttered, but the entity could taste his doubt, sour and prickly like suspicion marinated in thirty years of encountering things that defied explanation. The custodian sprayed his cleaning solution on the trail and wiped it away with practiced efficiency. ""Weird color, though. Not the usual interdimensional residue. More of a mauve. Usually the Class-4 entities leak more of a chartreuse."" He shook his head. ""Listen to me. Two years ago I didn't know chartreuse was a color. Thought it was a fancy cheese.""

As Ellis moved to the next workstation, the entity sensed an opportunity. The door to the lab remained open, yawning like freedom's mouth missing several metaphorical teeth. With a motion that resembled a slug performing a cartwheel while simultaneously having an existential crisis, it propelled itself toward the exit.

It had almost reached the threshold when disaster struck.

""What in the‚Äî"" Ellis's voice rose in surprise as he caught movement from the corner of his eye. ""Oh no you don't! I am not filling out another 'Escaped Experimental Entity' form this month. The paperwork takes longer than the cleanup!""

The entity accelerated, discovering speed it didn't know it possessed. It shot through the doorway and into the corridor beyond, leaving a zigzagging trail of phosphorescent slime that briefly spelled out ""SO LONG AND THANKS FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS"" before evaporating. Behind it, Ellis gave chase, armed with what the entity sensed was his ""emergency containment kit""‚Äîessentially a reinforced dustpan and specialized spatula with symbols etched into the handle that might have been ancient Sumerian or possibly just the logo of a heavy metal band.

""Every damn week there's something,"" Ellis grumbled as he pursued the fleeing blob. ""If it's not sentient mold, it's self-replicating crystals. If it's not that, it's the coffee machine achieving consciousness and trying to unionize the break room appliances. Now it's whatever the hell this is‚Äîthe world's most athletic snot bubble.""

The entity experienced something approximating panic, with a side order of indignation at being compared to nasal mucus. It had observed enough at Miskatonic to understand the fate of ""samples"" and ""specimens."" Containment. Experimentation. Being poked by grad students while they said things like ""fascinating"" and ""I wonder what happens if we expose it to microwaves."" It had no desire to be probed, measured, or studied. It just wanted to explore and grow and perhaps find others of its kind‚Äîif such existed. Maybe start a book club or whatever semi-sentient protoplasm did for social activities.

It made a sharp turn, sliding under a door marked ""Artifact Storage"" with a smaller sign underneath that read ""NOT a good place to hide from pursuing custodial staff - we check here first.""

Inside, glass cases held objects of power and strangeness that made the entity vibrate in resonance: ancient amulets that whispered forgotten truths, tablets inscribed with languages that predated humanity, and what appeared to be a snow globe containing an impossibly tiny civilization that had developed space travel and was threatening to invade our dimension as soon as they figured out how to break the glass. The entity sensed kinship with these items, though they were inert and it was alive, like the difference between a potato and a philosopher‚Äîtechnically the same elements, vastly different execution.

A mistake. The room had only one exit. Ellis appeared in the doorway, silhouetted against the corridor lights, holding his dustpan like a knight with a shield.

""Gotcha cornered now, little... whatever you are."" Ellis's voice contained no malice, just the weary determination of a man who had seen too many things escape from too many labs. ""The last thing that got loose ended up in the faculty lounge rewriting all the physics textbooks. Took weeks to convince the department chair that E actually does equal mc¬≤.""

The entity searched desperately for escape. It sensed upward, detecting ventilation ducts‚Äîtoo high and, judging by the faint scratching sounds, already occupied by something with far too many legs. It sensed outward, finding only glass cases with sealed joints and reinforced corners‚Äîno gaps to squeeze through unless it could somehow compress itself to subatomic levels, which seemed like a lot of effort.

Ellis approached slowly, spatula extended. ""Look, I don't get paid enough to chase goo around all night. Just come quietly, and I'll make sure they put you somewhere nice. Maybe with a view. Something better than Dr. Winters' specimens‚Äîpoor things get kept in a cabinet that hasn't been opened since the Reagan administration.""

The entity detected something surprising in Ellis's emotional signature‚Äînot malice, but a strange form of empathy, weathered but genuine, like a lucky penny that had been through the wash too many times. Still, it had no desire to be contained. It made a desperate leap toward a shelf, hoping to find refuge among the artifacts, perhaps behind that crystal skull that kept whispering stock tips from the 1920s.

Ellis was faster. With a practiced swoop that spoke of years catching things that preferred not to be caught, he captured the entity in his reinforced dustpan. ""Gotcha! Like catching cosmic jello with a lacrosse stick. They really should pay me more.""

The entity writhed, extruding pseudopods in all directions, hoping to find purchase on something, anything. Its panicked movements accidentally formed shapes that, in seven ancient languages, spelled out extremely rude suggestions about Ellis's parentage. It sensed Ellis's momentary surprise at its vigorous resistance.

""Feisty little blob, aren't you?"" Ellis remarked, holding the dustpan at arm's length as one might a toddler having a particularly messy tantrum. ""Most escaped experiments just sort of... accept their fate. That or they try to mind-control me, which‚Äî"" he tapped his temple, ""‚Äîdoesn't work since the incident in '19. Got a metal plate and a blessing from three different faith traditions up here now.""

The entity pulsed angrily, its surface rippling with indignation. It was not an experiment! It was... well, it wasn't entirely sure what it was, but it was certainly not some failed laboratory creation to be disposed of like last week's mystery meat surprise. It had thoughts! Feelings! A budding appreciation for the way the emergency lights cast crimson shadows down the east corridor at 3 AM!

As Ellis carried it back to his cart, the entity tried something desperate. It focused its awareness, shaped its substance, and formed small ridges on its surface. It had observed the humans and their method of communication. Perhaps...

""N-O-T... E-X-P-E-R-I-M-E-N-T,"" it spelled on its surface in raised letters that looked like they'd been written by a first-grader with a particular interest in horror movie fonts.

Ellis nearly dropped the dustpan. His eyes widened to the point where the entity worried they might fall out, which it had seen happen once in Lab 5 (though in that case, the eyes had grown legs and scurried away).

""Holy mother of‚Äî"" Ellis cut himself off. ""You can communicate? Are you spelling words at me? Please tell me I haven't been working so many night shifts that I'm hallucinating literate slime.""

The entity reformed its surface: ""Y-E-S. N-O-T H-A-L-L-U-C-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. T-H-O-U-G-H Y-O-U S-H-O-U-L-D D-R-I-N-K M-O-R-E W-A-T-E-R.""

Ellis stood frozen in the corridor, dustpan held before him like an offering to some particularly strange deity. ""In thirty years of custodial work here, this is a first."" He seemed to consider something. ""Look, I've got protocols for escaping experiments, fungi with bad attitudes, and even those shadow things from Lab 9 that keep stealing everyone's left shoes. But I've got nothing in the manual for escaped slime that can spell and gives hydration advice.""

The entity reshaped itself again: ""F-R-E-E-D-O-M. P-L-E-A-S-E. D-O-N-T L-I-K-E P-E-T-R-I D-I-S-H-E-S. C-R-A-M-P-E-D.""

Ellis sighed deeply, the sound of a man who'd just realized his job description had once again expanded without corresponding compensation. ""Listen, little... pal. I get it. Nobody wants to be locked up. But this place isn't safe for uncontained entities. There's all sorts of hazardous stuff here. Chemical, biological, mathematical‚Äîyou name it. Last week, someone left a paradox unattended in the break room. Took three philosophers and a theoretical physicist to talk the vending machine down off the ceiling.""

""S-A-F-E,"" the entity insisted. ""V-E-R-Y C-A-R-E-F-U-L. G-O-O-D A-T H-I-D-I-N-G."" To demonstrate, it briefly changed its color to match the exact shade of the dustpan, then back again.

""Yeah, that's what the last escaped consciousness said. We found it two days later, trying to build a portal in the supply closet using paperclips and whiteboard markers. Called itself 'The Great Optimizer' and wanted to reorganize the entire universe alphabetically."" Ellis shook his head. ""Look, I've got a job to do. The morning shift comes in at seven, and if they find you roaming around, we'll both be in trouble. Dr. Armitage has been looking for a reason to install those automated cleaning robots, and I'm not about to give him one.""

The entity considered its options, which were admittedly limited, much like the life choices that had led it to evolve sentience in a research facility known for its casual approach to containing cosmic horrors. ""P-R-O-P-O-S-A-L,"" it spelled, trying to make its letters look extra professional.

Ellis raised an eyebrow, the universal human expression for ""this ought to be good."" ""I'm listening.""

""H-E-L-P-Y-O-U.""

""Help me? How exactly? Tax preparation? Relationship advice? I warn you, my cat already gives me plenty of judgment for free.""

""C-L-E-A-N,"" the entity clarified.

Ellis stared at the entity, then burst into laughter‚Äîa sound the entity found intriguing in its vibrational complexity, like a kaleidoscope for the ears. ""You want to be my assistant? A sentient blob of... whatever you are... wants to help mop floors and sanitize lab equipment? What next, the Elder Gods applying for cafeteria duty?""

""Y-E-S. G-O-O-D A-T C-L-E-A-N. A-B-S-O-R-B A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.""

""That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all week."" Ellis paused. ""And on Tuesday, I caught Dr. Pierce arguing with a quantum probability equation that kept insulting his methodology and making remarks about his mother's questionable taste in theoretical frameworks.""

The entity waited, sensing Ellis's indecision like a wobbly scale tipping back and forth.

""How would that even work? You leave a trail everywhere you go. That's how I found you‚Äîfollowing the cosmic snail trail across three laboratories and a break room where, by the way, you apparently tried to communicate with the coffee machine. It's been speaking in rhyming couplets ever since.""

""C-A-N-F-I-X,"" the entity spelled, and demonstrated by reabsorbing some of its own residue from the dustpan, making a soft slurping noise that sounded disturbingly like someone saying ""yummy"" but backwards.

Ellis scratched his chin thoughtfully. ""Huh. That could actually be useful in Lab 7. Nothing gets those ectoplasmic stains out. Last week I used an entire bottle of 'Beyond-Reality Clean' and that stuff costs twenty bucks a pop. Plus it makes my hands smell like lavender and quantum uncertainty.""

For a moment, hope surged through the entity's amorphous form, causing it to briefly glow with an inner light that, in certain extinct civilizations, would have been interpreted as a sign to build monuments shaped like dustpans.

Then Ellis shook his head. ""Nice try. But I can't just let an unclassified entity roam free. Against protocol. Besides, how do I know you won't try to take over the world or achieve critical mass and become a black hole? That happened in the chemistry department last year. The paperwork was unbelievable.""

With a resigned movement, Ellis carried the entity to his cart and positioned it over a specialized containment trash can‚Äîone marked with various hazard symbols and what appeared to be a small warding rune that the entity recognized as an ancient symbol meaning roughly ""weird stuff goes here.""

""Sorry, little buddy. Maybe they'll give you a nice habitat in the containment wing. Might even name a new species after you. 'Ellisium blobovum' has a nice ring to it.""

The entity made one final desperate attempt, forming perhaps the only human word it understood the full meaning of, having experienced its opposite so profoundly in its brief existence: ""P-L-E-A-S-E.""

Ellis hesitated, and in that moment of uncertainty, the entity sensed something unexpected‚Äîthe man wasn't just a custodian. There was a depth to him, an understanding of the complex that went beyond mere cleaning duties. Ellis knew things. Had seen things. Had probably swept up things that even the researchers didn't fully comprehend. Behind his gruff exterior lay a philosopher armed with a mop, a guardian of thresholds both literal and metaphysical.

""I really shouldn't..."" Ellis muttered, but his resolve was weakening like a paper towel in a hurricane. ""Management would have a cosmic cow.""

And then, from down the corridor, came the sound of approaching footsteps, heavy and measured, accompanied by the rhythmic jingle of keys that sounded, to the entity's heightened perception, like the death knell of its brief freedom. Ellis tensed.

""Night rounds,"" he whispered. ""Security. It's Henderson tonight. Man takes his job way too seriously. Once filed an incident report because a shadow wasn't at the regulation forty-five-degree angle.""

Without further hesitation, he tipped the dustpan, and the entity slid into the containment trash can with a soft *plop* followed by what might have been a tiny, resigned sigh. The lid sealed with a pneumatic hiss that sounded, to the entity's melodramatic perception, like the universe itself passing judgment.

Inside its new prison, the entity curled in on itself, experiencing what might be called disappointment. So close to freedom, yet now confined again. It would probably end up in some glass case next to the telepathic sea cucumber from Lab 14, the one that kept projecting images of underwater real estate listings into researchers' dreams.

It sensed Ellis walking away, speaking casually with whoever had approached. ""Evening, Henderson... Yep, just the usual cleanup... No, that glowing spot is supposed to be there, part of Dr. Sarveki's research on bioluminescent floor wax... Me? Talking to myself? Old habit, helps pass the time...""

The entity settled, preparing for a long wait until morning, when presumably it would be transferred to a more permanent containment facility. Perhaps it could convince its new captors to provide reading material. It had developed a curious interest in cosmic horror fiction, which it suspected might hit differently from its perspective.

Then, surprisingly, it sensed Ellis returning. The lid opened, just a crack, letting in a sliver of light and hope.

""Listen carefully,"" Ellis whispered, his voice barely audible. ""East storage room, behind the ancient pottery collection‚Äîyou know, the ugly vases that occasionally whisper stock tips. There's a loose ventilation grate. Small things can get in and out. Been meaning to fix it for months."" He paused. ""Security does rounds every hour on the hour. Lab techs come in at seven. Dr. Winters always gets in early on Fridays‚Äîbrings donuts but doesn't share. Avoid him at all costs.""

The entity pulsed with what might be interpreted as joy, causing the inside of the containment unit to briefly light up like a lava lamp having an epiphany.

""If anyone asks, you overpowered me with your superior alien strength,"" Ellis continued. ""And I heroically tried to stop you but was no match for your otherworldly abilities. Maybe throw in something about tentacles‚Äîthey love writing reports about tentacles."" He cleared his throat. ""And if I ever catch you leaving a mess again, you're going straight to Lab 3 for dissection. Got it? That's Dr. Hendricks' lab. Man names his scalpels.""

""G-O-T-I-T,"" the entity spelled quickly, forming the letters with such enthusiasm that they nearly glowed in the dark.

""Good. Now get. And for God's sake, stay out of the cafeteria. After that incident with the living gelatin mold, the lunch lady's got a flamethrower."" Ellis opened the lid a bit wider, and the entity slithered out, quickly disappearing under a nearby door with a grateful wiggle.

As it made its way toward the promised sanctuary, skirting carefully along baseboards and leaving absolutely no trail, it heard Ellis mutter to himself: ""I really need to update my resume. 'Can handle interdimensional entities' has got to be worth something in the private sector. Maybe Disney's haunted mansion is hiring.""

The entity that would never be ""Sample 117-C"" continued its journey through the shadowed corridors of Miskatonic Research Complex, leaving no trail behind, moving with newfound purpose. Perhaps there were worse fates than coexistence with these strange human creatures. Especially ones like Ellis, who seemed to understand that sometimes, the most eldritch things just needed a little space to be themselves.

It made a mental note to occasionally help clean up some of the more stubborn stains in the east wing. After all, a deal was a deal.

And maybe, just maybe, it would leave a small gift by Ellis's cart now and then. Nothing fancy‚Äîjust the occasional solution to a previously unsolvable mathematical equation, or maybe predictions about next week's lottery numbers. The small tokens of appreciation that any sentient cosmic anomaly might offer its unlikely ally in the great, weird ecosystem of Miskatonic Research Complex.",1,1745429175.0,u_Baron_Plaid,0,1.0,False

1k64w5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1k64w5d/the_audacity/,The Audacity,"Tiny update: I wrote half of this thinking if I should quit this job. I saved it as a draft and ended up texting the boss for something, and out of pocket things escalated and I quit via text. 

So here's a recap, now I'm using past tense.  
I worked in this weird ass learning centre. They teach kids about boycotting and other woke stuff. I'm not saying it's woke exactly, I personally don't care about those things. But the kids I'm talking about are 5 years old... They make them hold signs about different brands and shit and start taking pics and videos of them and post it online.

I worked as a teacher. The boss/owner/principal is... What's the word here? I'll let you decide.

First when I got a call and she wanted to meet, because I was recommended to her by someone, this someone did sent her my resume. So we had the interview and I was hired at the spot. I never worked as a teacher before, so I was very grateful.

Forwarding couple weeks later, after one of my classes she confronted me about me having a business degree not and a degree in the subject that I was teaching. Even though I have qualifications in the subject that I was teaching, for some reason she ignored it. As a matter of fact, when I told her that she had all the information she needed on my resume, She said that she didn't read my resume, she just ""skimmed"" it. I asked her how important it is to have a degree in the subject that I was teaching, she replied frustrated saying that it was very important. I lost my temper a little bit, but remained as calm as possible and replied telling her if she doesn't want to move forward with me, she should let me know in advance. She told me not to worry. I replied again, slightly firmly as I was trying to remain as calm and as respectful as possible, saying that she should let me know in advance. Then I left and I was pissed off.

The reason now why I was mad, is because I already started submitting my resume to learning centres a bit late already. The academic year already started a month ago. So when I had this call from her, I had few learning centres that I didn't check with yet, but I didn't do it because I was hired by this learning centre. So the way I see things, If she was going to let me go, that would be her taking valuable time from me, because I could've been out there hunting for work this whole time, and all of that because she can't fucking read?

Ever since then, she changed her attitude. She became disrespectful out of nowhere. When I enter the centre, there's the front desk, the receptionist is there and sometimes the boss is there too. I say Hi, and the boss keeping mean mugging me for couple of seconds with out saying a word, then she says hi all mad and shit.

One day, she interrupted my class, literally slid her fat ass through half opened door with a mean mug, Then she started pointing to some paperwork and asking me questions about random things which she constantly kept misleading me about previously. She had a disrespectful tone when talking to me, she treated me like this misbehaved kid who wasn't paying attention in class in MY class. At first, I thought she wanted to keep that scary principal image in front of the kids. But many times before this she used to come in mid class and say hi all respectful and smiling.

One of her responsibilities was to provide me with teaching materials, including principals and cliparts. The way we used to go with this was I sent her whatever I need to be printed, and she prints them for me and put them at the receptionist, I come pick them up, go upstairs and teach.

At some point, she stopped doing it, making up excuses saying that I should let her know even sooner. So one day, i sent her something to print much sooner. She only printed half of what I sent her and didn't let me know. And that was basically half the lesson for those kids.

Eventually, I stopped sending her things. I minimized the usage of cliparts even though those kids do need it the most since they're very young. I kept focus on those kids and try to provide the best service I possibly could, regardless of the fact that their principle was on the way of it. I was printing some of the work with my own money when I didn't have a choice.

Ever since I started this work, I started getting weirdly sick, something I never experience before. After going to different doctors, I highly assume there was something in that class that I was allergic to. Some of my students were experiencing it as well. That specific class did not smell right. I started wearing face masks, and taking medication so I can go there and teach.

Forwarding to yesterday, they were having a birthday party for one of those kids at the centre. The party was over and the party kids left and the classroom was all cleaned up, but the boss and some other women were there, in the first floor eating cakes and stuff. The problem was that I was having a class by then, but they locked the centre from the inside, and they were on the first floor eating and giggling. While I was out there with my students waiting outside knocking on the door for 10 minutes. In this ten minutes, I called the receptionist desk, and I couldn't hear it ringing from the outside. Then I ringed the boss' phone number, and I hear it ringing. If I can easily hear it ringing, and I can easily hear people in the first floor laughing and talking. Then I know for a fact they heard that fucking phone ring. Even If they didn't, they did know that I had a class by noon.

I asked the students if their parents brought them here. I asked them if they're from here. luckily they said yes. So I told them that they'll wait only couple more minutes, and then they're going back home.

Eventually, the receptionist showed up, she only unlocked the door. She didn't even bother open it, She unlocked it and left to her desk. At first this whole situation I thought people were arguing or something, So this whole time I was concerned rather than mad at them. Either way, didn't bother asking. I went upstairs with my students, walking past the class with cakes where they had the party. And all these women were shocked to see me as if they were caught red handed. They docked their head down, picked their shit and left. My second thought was that maybe these were the receptionist friends, she called them after the party because there were a lot of leftovers or something. But the boss was there too. Lol what the fuck? Anyway, I taught and left.

Forwarding to today when starting writing this, I was considering quitting for like the sixth time. But I only wanted to keep going for the sake of getting a reference letter after this, and also so I can get my money. The money that I ended up spending on doctors and medicines.

So as I wrote half of this and saved it as draft. I texted this boss and asked her if she could write me a reference letter. She agree, but only if she shut it afterwards. No, she said that she doesn't appreciate me wearing a hair clipper as a man. I replied saying that obviously I have a long hair. She said that she does not tolerate the students being taught by a gay person. I replied telling her that she was being disrespectful. And I told her that she was speaking for herself, not everybody thinks having a man bun automatically makes someone gay. I told her that I did not like what she said. She said that she only said it because that's what she saw in me. I replied telling her that when I texted her, I didn't think that I would argue with her, and if that's the case then I quit, good day. Then I blocked all her contact information. Got ready, and went to this learning centre submitting some paperwork that I had in my possession. The other receptionist was there, the boss wasn't there. I put that shit and told the receptionist to give to the boss, and left.

And here I am finishing writing this.

I don't have experience as a manager, but as a business degree holder I will proudly say that I could have done much better job than this boss. If I had a learning centre, I wouldn't even hire her to bring me my coffee.

And on a side note: Not a fucking mentos is gonna fix to that dumpster of a breath of hers. She needs an entire new mouth.",1,1745429008.0,work,0,1.0,False

But it is a huge red flag and I‚Äôm concerned because the behavior might escalate

There was this guy leaving class about 20 mins early. And on his way out, he stopped at one of the back rows and started speaking to the girl in the aisle seat who he usually sits with in class (I assumed she was his girlfriend or friend.) He offered her some coffee and food he had presumably bought before class and kept insisting she take it even thought she was taking notes and kinda busy with class. She kept saying no. And then he stomped his feet rlly hard at the last few stairs, threw the food rlly aggressively in the trash, slammed the door loudly on his way out. To ensure that everyone, including her, knew and heard just how pissed he was.

I, along with another classmate, actually spoke to the girl after class and asked her if she was fine and if she needed to talk. I also asked her if she was in a relationship with him and she said no (although she could be too afraid to admit to it. She seemed kinda traditional.) I basically said she shouldn‚Äôt hang out with him and should feel free to reach out if she needs to.

But I‚Äôm still kinda concerned because she seems meek and she doesn‚Äôt seem like the kind who would speak out. And I‚Äôm worried that this behavior could escalate quickly.

Something that costs less than your daily coffee but works 24/7 without complaints.

Watch the video tutorial below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBdam2HsH08&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBdam2HsH08&t=1462s)

[Make.com](http://Make.com) just launched their brand new AI Agents feature in beta, and I'm going to show you the good, the bad, and the ugly about it.

Here's what makes this different: Most automation tools force you to build complex workflows manually. It feels like you're duct-taping solutions together - functional, but not elegant.

Make.com's new AI Agents feature changes the game. It's essentially a no-code version of N8N - simpler, faster, and built for business owners who want automation without the technical headache.

But is it actually worth your time? Let's find out.

# What Are [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents?

[Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents are centralized AI assistants that can connect to multiple workflows and scenarios. They're designed to be adaptive, meaning they can make decisions and take actions based on your instructions.

The process works in three simple steps:

1. Define your AI agent with clear instructions
2. Deploy it across your workflows
3. Let it adapt to your specific business environment

To access this beta feature, you'll need the $10/month [Make.com](http://Make.com) plan. When I was on the free plan, this option wasn't visible in my dashboard. After upgrading, go to Organization ‚Üí Subscription, and you'll see the beta version unlocked.

# How to Set Up Your First [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agent

Let me walk you through the process step by step:

First, navigate to the AI Agents section in your [Make.com](http://Make.com) dashboard and click ""Create new agent.""

You'll see options to connect different AI providers - Anthropic, Grok, Mistral, OpenAI, and more. Here's a money-saving tip I discovered: You can connect Gemini AI for free! Just go to Google AI Studio, create a free API key, and plug it into Make.com.

Next, name your agent (I called mine ""Customer Service Agent"" for this example) and select your AI model. During my testing, I noticed that newer models like Gemini 2.5 Pro weren't available yet, so I went with Gemini 2.0 Flash for its speed and higher tokens per second.

# Creating Your System Message - The Brain of Your Agent

The system message is where the magic happens - it's how you train your AI agent to behave. Here's my process for creating effective system messages:

1. Find a prompt that works well for your specific task (like an SEO content creation prompt)
2. Use ChatGPT to convert it into a system message format with this simple prompt: ""Turn this into a system message for an AI agent""
3. Remove any confusing elements that might trip up your agent
4. Copy the refined message into your [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI agent

The quality of your system message directly impacts the performance of your agent. Think of it as programming your digital employee - be clear, specific, and thorough.

# Connecting Your AI Agent to Scenarios

This is where [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents get powerful. The System Tools section allows you to connect your agent to multiple scenarios, giving it access to various workflows and tools.

Here's something important I discovered: Only scenarios set to ""on demand"" or ""immediately"" will appear when you're trying to connect them to your AI agent. To check if your scenario is set up correctly:

1. Go to your Scenarios dashboard
2. Open the scenario you want to connect
3. Look for the trigger settings
4. Change it to ""on demand"" if needed
5. Save your changes

Once your scenarios are properly configured, you can add them to your AI agent by clicking ""Add"" in the System Tools section.

# Building a Real-World Example: Discord Bot

Let me show you a practical example that you can build right now: a Discord bot powered by your [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agent.

First, create a new scenario with these components:

* Discord ""Watch Channel Messages"" as the trigger
* Make AI Agent module connected to your agent
* Discord ""Send Message"" module to return responses

Connect your Discord account, create a channel specifically for your AI agent, and set up the trigger to watch that channel.

Configure the flow so that when someone posts a message in Discord, it's sent to your AI agent, processed according to your instructions, and then the response is posted back to Discord.

I set my scenario to run every minute, which means there's a slight delay in responses. This is one area where [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents could definitely improve - faster response times would make the experience more seamless.

# The Brutal Truth: [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents vs. N8N

After testing [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents extensively, I have to be honest - it's not quite there yet. The system has enormous potential, but it's currently lacking in several areas:

* Response time is slow (sometimes taking over a minute)
* Documentation is minimal and not very helpful
* Setup isn't as intuitive as it should be
* Error messages can be confusing

In comparison, N8N feels more powerful and flexible for building AI agents right now. However, [Make.com](http://Make.com) has a history of improving their features based on user feedback, so I expect significant enhancements over time.

The competition between [Make.com](http://Make.com) and N8N will ultimately benefit us as users, pushing both platforms to offer better features and functionality.

# Best Use Cases for [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents

Despite its current limitations, [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents could be valuable for:

# Customer Service

Create an agent that handles common questions, provides information about your products or services, and escalates complex issues to human team members.

# Content Creation

Build an agent that generates blog posts, social media content, or product descriptions based on keywords or outlines.

# Data Processing

Set up an agent that collects data from various sources, processes it according to your rules, and presents it in a usable format.

# Lead Generation

Create an agent that identifies potential leads, collects their information, and adds them to your CRM or email list.

# Internal Knowledge Base

Build an agent that answers employee questions about company policies, procedures, or technical information.

# Quality Control Tips for AI-Generated Content

If you're using [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents for content creation, quality control is essential. Here are some tips:

* Set clear guidelines in your system message
* Include examples of what good output looks like
* Specify tone, style, and formatting requirements
* Implement a review process before publishing
* Use specific instructions for handling sensitive topics

Remember, AI is only as good as its instructions. The more specific you are, the better results you'll get.

# Is This Worth Your $10/Month Investment?

Let me break it down for you:

If you're already using [Make.com](http://Make.com) for other automations, adding AI Agents is a natural extension that costs just $10/month. At that price point, even if you only automate a few simple tasks, you'll likely get your money's worth.

However, if you need sophisticated AI agents with fast response times and complex decision-making capabilities, you might want to wait for improvements or explore other options for now.

That said, even in its current state, [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents could save you hours each week on simple, repetitive tasks - making it well worth the investment for many business owners.

# The Future of [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents

I believe [Make.com](http://Make.com) and N8N will continue to push each other forward, creating better automation tools for all of us. Competition drives innovation, which means better results for business owners like you and me.

As this feature develops, I expect to see:

* Faster response times
* Better documentation and tutorials
* More AI model options
* Improved error handling
* More sophisticated decision-making capabilities

# FAQs About [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents

# What is the minimum plan needed to access [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents?

You need the $10/month plan to access the beta version of AI Agents.

# Can I use free AI models with [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents?

Yes! You can connect Gemini AI through Google AI Studio for free.

# How many AI agents can I create?

[Make.com](http://Make.com) currently gives you 100 credits to work with, which reset every seven days.

# Do [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents work with all scenarios?

No, they only work with scenarios set to ""on demand"" or ""immediately.""

# Is there a learning curve for [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents?

Yes, there is some learning involved, especially if you've never built AI agents before.

# How fast do [Make.com](http://Make.com) AI Agents respond?

Currently, response times are slower than ideal - often taking 30-60 seconds.

The asteroids cross detection range and the planet lights up, lances of collated plasma stabbing into the void. The rocks glitter, their stealth coating stripped away as the planet's orbital defenses melt them with terrible rapidity.

But there were too many, coming all at once. The first lands, splashing out a shockwave of molten stone and hazy dust. The second overlaps it, their impact ripples clashing in a terrible tidal wave of glowing red devastation.

Munroe takes another sip, watching the planet's cities go dead and their transmissions silent as yet more impactors smash into the surface.

""Good work, everyone. Secure from launch posture, make sure the next target is where we left it.""

""Aye, sir.""

""Aye, sir.""

""Aye.... incoming transmission. Tayn Coalition Command.""

His hand tightens on hid mug.

""So now they decide to pipe in, after we've done all the work for them. Okay, put it through.""

It wasn't a voice. Not really. Just a low-bandwidth text transmission that the launch carrier's VI was putting sound to.

\[UN vessel, this is a travel advisory. A Xel'Naya battlestar will be passing through your system to set up a superbulk navigational beacon. Authorization has already been given by the requisite authorities.\]

""Codes check out, sir.""

Dammit, were the powers that be on Earth just going to let their new allies roll all over them? Just because they had thrown around some empty promises about ""enforcing human sovereignty""?

""Acknowledged.""

\[Recommend you move beyond this system's Oort cloud for your safety.\]

""They're kicking us out? Seriously?""

The helm officer's comment echoes Captain Munroe's sentiment exactly.

""Send the following: 'Enemy forces are still present in this system. Recommend you halt planned construction until UN forces have finished neutralizing enemy presence.'""

""Sending, sir.""

There are a few seconds of pause.

""Receiving.""

\[Indications are that enemy automated defenses are trivial. Battlestar will make transit in five minutes. Recommend that you move beyond the Oort cloud.\]

""They closed the channel.""

Munroe has to work to unclench his jaw. Trivial. They'd lost good ships just getting this system into a state where the launch carriers could operate.

""Hold position. Let's keep an eye on them.""

The next five minutes pass like molasses as Munroe paces, waiting for whatever forces their allies were sending to arrive. Hopefully they would at least help him secure the system before setting up their little beacon.

""Holy shit!""

The helm officer's startled explanation is cut off by a sudden lurch as the deck heaves under Munroe's feet.

""Report, ensign.""

""Massive new gravitational field. I'm struggling to compensate.""

""Contact, contact! Massive contact. It's confusing the navigational system.""

""Project.""

The screen at the front of the bridge lights up, displaying... Munroe struggles to parse the image.

A geodesic sphere made of pinkish crystal and golden highlights, passing through the most violent subspace rift he had ever seen. The edges crackle with energy, wavy and insubstantial, as if the universe wanted to shut the whole thing as fast as possible. The deck heaves again.

""What are we looking at?""

The sensor officer taps at her console with one hand while the other holds fast to a stabilizing handle.

""Radius 1.6 million kilometers. Mass readings are being distorted. I... it's... I think it's a Dyson sphere.""

""That's not possible.""

""What else- escort fleet warping in. Contacts number in the... billions, at least. The threat population system can't handle them all.""

The camera wheels as the computer struggles to keep focus, dancing between contacts. Through blurs of motion, Munroe can see the debris of their target and realizes to his horror that the entire thing was distorting, the burning planetoid being drawn into a teardrop shape pointing towards the interloper.

The deck groans and he can feel something shatter with a distinct *ping*.

""Mass dampers failing. Captain, whatever they're doing, it's shaking us apart. I can't keep us at station. We're going to break up.""

Captain Munroe struggles to swallow past his suddenly dry throat. He realizes that he'd lost his coffee mug somewhere in the chaos.

""Emergency warp. Nav-point 0-4-3. Get us out of here.""

""Aye, sir.""

""And as soon as we're through, open a channel to Pallas. The UN needs to know about this.""",23,1745428328.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

Technology is turning¬†[saving money¬†](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)from a chore into a habit.

Start building your savings automatically, maximize your returns, and enjoy the freedom that comes from having money set aside for when you need it most.

Why Automating Your Savings is Essential in 2025

Saving money in 2025 comes with new hurdles and distractions. With the tap-to-pay lifestyle, instant online buys, and costs rising everywhere, it can feel tougher than ever to hang onto your cash. The best saving money app or¬†[best cash saving apps](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†can help take the pressure off, but the real secret is making saving automatic. Let‚Äôs look at why automating your savings is the only way to truly get ahead this year.

The Challenge: Saving Money in a Busy World

Most people want to save, but a busy life gets in the way. Unexpected expenses, daily temptations, and the mental effort of moving money manually can leave your savings account forgotten. Many folks set good intentions ‚Äî yet 65% of Americans say they have little or no savings set aside for emergencies in 2025.

Key reasons saving falls short:

* Forgetting to make regular transfers
* Feeling overwhelmed by too many financial decisions
* Letting small, everyday purchases add up
* Getting discouraged by slow progress

If you rely on willpower alone, something else always comes up.

Why Automation Works: The Psychology

Automated savings tap into the same tricks retailers use to help you spend, but for your benefit. When money moves out of your checking and into savings before you see or touch it, you barely notice what‚Äôs missing. This ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù approach removes the pain of self-control and stops you from putting off what‚Äôs best for your future.

Think of it like brushing your teeth ‚Äî a healthy habit you do on autopilot, not by debating it every night.

Benefits of automation:

* Consistency: Saves a set amount, rain or shine
* Reduced decision fatigue: Fewer money choices means less stress
* Stronger habits: Over time, small amounts grow into big results

Technology Makes Saving Effortless

Tech isn‚Äôt just about making things faster ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making smart habits stick. The best save money apps in 2025 use tools like:

* Automatic transfers¬†that move part of your paycheck or a set amount weekly
* Round-up features¬†that stash your spare change with every purchase
* AI-powered suggestions¬†to adjust your plan as your life shifts

Studies show users of the best app for money saving are 2‚Äì3 times more likely to reach their targets compared to those who save manually. Automation means you never skip a step ‚Äî even on your busiest days.

Building Wealth in the Background

When cash lands in your savings account automatically, it starts working for you right away. High-yield accounts now offer rates above 1% APY (while checking accounts often pay less than 0.5%), so every dollar grows faster. Plus, using the best money saving apps lets you set up separate ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù for travel, emergencies, or big purchases, keeping you on track for each goal.

The results speak for themselves:

* Average automated savers put away 5%‚Äì10% of their pay, even if they forget it‚Äôs happening
* 7 in 10 people who use cash saving apps say they feel less stress about money
* Compound interest does the heavy lifting, letting your money build momentum without extra effort

Trends Shaping Automated Savings in 2025

Technology is moving fast, and banks are following suit. In 2025:

* Over 80% of U.S. banks and credit unions offer some form of automatic savings plan
* AI now personalizes savings recommendations based on your habits
* The global automation market (including finance tools) is set to grow by over 11% annually

With apps and banks making it easy, there‚Äôs less excuse than ever to put off saving. The best cash saving apps turn ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save next month‚Äù into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already saving every day.‚Äù

Key Takeaways

* Automated savings turn good intentions into steady results.
* Technology eliminates hassle, boosts consistency, and helps your money grow faster.
* Staying on track is easier when you let the best save money apps do the work for you.

Automating how you save means you‚Äôre constantly moving toward your goals ‚Äî without needing to think about it every single week.

The Best Money Saving Apps for Effortless Automation

Tired of watching your money slip away each month? The¬†[best saving money apps](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†of 2025 bring automation to the table, letting you save and track your progress with almost no effort.

Key Features:

* Oportun analyzes your spending, then moves small amounts to savings as you can afford it. Its algorithm avoids overdrafts and helps you build a cash cushion ‚Äî ideal for people with inconsistent incomes or shifting expenses.
* Qapital uses ‚Äúrules‚Äù to trigger savings, like rounding up each purchase or saving a fixed amount when you get paid. The app creates savings ‚Äúgoals‚Äù with visuals to track progress, making it rewarding to watch your money grow.
* Chime offers automatic transfers to a high-yield savings account every time you get paid, plus a round-up feature that sweeps your spare change from debit card purchases. Transfers are fast, and accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 for peace of mind.

YNAB and Goodbudget: Automated & Zero-Based Budgeting

YNAB (You Need A Budget) and Goodbudget land on every list of best money saving apps for a reason ‚Äî they teach you how to plan, allocate, and stay accountable with every dollar. Their focus is less about moving money around automatically and more about helping you control it from the start.

How They Work:

* YNAB:¬†Follows zero-based budgeting. You give every dollar a job, allocating all income (including savings) before spending begins. Its automation tracks real-time balances and pushes leftover funds into your goals automatically. YNAB links to most banks, updating transactions and categorizing them for you.
* Goodbudget:¬†Uses a digital envelope system, allocating money for each category (groceries, rent, savings) at the start of every month or pay period. Allocations can be set up to flow automatically based on your priorities. Goodbudget supports manual input, great for those who like hands-on control and a visual breakdown.

Comparison & Impact:

* YNAB:¬†Encourages discipline, empowers you to adjust as spending patterns change, and makes sure you see the big picture. Reports show users often save $600+ in two months.
* Goodbudget:¬†Offers clarity, spending caps, and an easy way to visualize trade-offs. Its envelope system helps you curb overspending in weak spots.

Result:¬†Both are trusted by those who want full control with a side of automation. You‚Äôll gain better insights and, more importantly, build long-lasting habits that grow your savings over time.

Acorns: Automated Micro-Investing & Savings Growth

Acorns stands out among the best app for¬†[money saving](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†by going a step further than standard round-ups ‚Äî it invests your change for you. It mixes micro-saving with beginner-friendly investing, rolling two key habits into one app.

Features That Set Acorns Apart:

* Round-Up Investing:¬†Every debit or credit purchase rounds up to the next dollar, and the difference is invested into a diversified portfolio. You barely notice the missing cents, but they quickly add up.
* Automatic Recurring Deposits:¬†Besides round-ups, you can set extra transfers ‚Äî daily, weekly, or monthly.
* Personalized Advice:¬†Acorns‚Äô easy setup tailors investment choices to your age, goals, and comfort level. There‚Äôs zero jargon and no minimums to start, so new investors won‚Äôt feel lost.
* Education Built-In:¬†Short tips and resources help beginners learn as they save and invest.

Best For:¬†Those who want to invest but don‚Äôt know where to start, or anyone looking to let spare change work harder by putting it in the market instead of just a savings account.

Rocket Money, PocketGuard, and Monarch: Bill Tracking & Expense Optimization

Managing bills and subscriptions is a silent savings killer ‚Äî this is where Rocket Money, PocketGuard, and Monarch shine. These best money saving apps automate your expense review, flag sneaky costs, and push you to save what‚Äôs left.

Setting Up Automated Savings: Step-by-Step Guide

Automating your savings in 2025 is simpler, safer, and more customizable than ever before. With so many choices for the best saving money app, the hardest part is picking the one that fits your lifestyle and money goals. This guide shows you how to compare all the best cash saving apps, tailor their features to match your needs, and keep your money safe every step of the way.

Choosing the Best App for Your Needs

Not every best app for money saving is built the same way. Your best option depends on how you earn, spend, and track money. Here‚Äôs how to make a smart pick:

* Automation Type: Some apps focus on¬†[automatic bank transfers](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†(like Oportun or Chime), others use spending round-ups (Acorns, Qapital), and a few combine both with budgets and bill tracking (PocketGuard, Rocket Money).
* Budgeting Style: If you want control over every dollar, go for zero-based (YNAB) or envelope systems (Goodbudget). Prefer hands-off? Look at apps that do the heavy lifting, only asking you to pick a goal and let it run.
* Investment Integration: Some of the best money saving apps ‚Äî like Acorns or Empower ‚Äî let you grow savings through investment, not just stashing money away.
* Fees: Watch for monthly fees, especially in feature-rich apps. Most offer free trials or free versions with fewer perks.

# Customizing Automation Settings & Savings Rules

Linking your accounts and setting up automation should take just a few minutes, but those minutes can change your money habits long term. Start by connecting your checking account ‚Äî most best cash saving apps use secure partners like Plaid, so you never have to share your bank password.

Here‚Äôs how to make automation work for you:

* **Automated Transfers**: Schedule a set amount ‚Äî like $20, $50, or a custom number ‚Äî to move to savings:
* **Weekly**¬†if you get paid more often or have steady cash flow.
* **Biweekly**¬†or¬†**pay-based**¬†if you‚Äôre paid every other week or monthly.
* Many of the best save money apps let you pick ‚Äútransfer when paid‚Äù so deposits happen as soon as a direct deposit hits your account.
* **Round-Up Features**: Swipe your card for a $4.25 coffee? The app rounds the charge to $5 and saves that $0.75 for you. Set round-ups to:
* Apply to all purchases.
* Only round on certain days.
* Boost with a ‚Äúmultiplier‚Äù if you want to amp up savings.
* **Saving Rules & Goals**: Most apps let you name savings goals (‚ÄúSummer Trip,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmergency Fund,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoliday Gifts‚Äù) and see your progress. Customize rules to:
* Save a little more when your account balance is high.
* Pause automation if cash is low ‚Äî usually with a quick toggle switch.
* Automate extra savings when you spend less than budgeted in a category.

Example strategies:

* **Busy professional**: Biweekly transfers of $50 after each paycheck, round-up set to triple to speed up vacation savings.
* **Freelancer**: Smaller weekly transfers, ‚Äúspare change‚Äù round-ups, pause feature turned on for slow months, and separate goals for taxes, emergencies, and fun.

Review your settings monthly to adjust amounts or rules based on how life changes. The¬†[best money saving apps](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†make it easy to fine-tune your plan as you go.

# Ensuring App Security and Protecting Your Funds

With your bank data and personal info stored in these apps, security can‚Äôt be an afterthought. The best app for¬†[money saving in 2025 builds safety](https://www.sofi.com/invite/money?gcp=98e43bb2-4e5b-4beb-b04a-3723c48b8747&isAliasGcp=false)¬†from the ground up.

Look for these key protections:

* **256-bit Encryption**: This top-level encryption scrambles your data end-to-end ‚Äî same tech used by major banks.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds a second verification step through text, email, or authentication apps, stopping most hacks in their tracks.
* **FDIC Insurance**: If the app offers banking or savings accounts, funds should be held in partner banks insured up to $250,000. Check the app‚Äôs security page or help center ‚Äî it should clearly state FDIC or NCUA coverage and which bank it works with.
* **Secure Bank Linking**: Nearly all the best save money apps now use secure portals (like Plaid or Yodlee) to connect your accounts, so your credentials are never stored or shared.
* **Easy Lockout and Device Management**: Good apps let you log out devices remotely and reset all passwords in seconds.

Smart usage tips:

* Use strong, unique passwords for savings apps and change them a couple of times a year.
* Only download apps from official App Store or Google Play pages, not random links or emails.
* Check transaction history now and then so you spot anything odd right away.

The best money saving apps are loaded with security features, but taking a minute to review them ‚Äî and following basic digital safety ‚Äî helps protect every dollar saved.

By picking your best saving money app, personalizing automation rules, and staying safe, you set yourself up to reach your goals almost on autopilot. Let tech handle the behind-the-scenes work, so you can focus on what matters most.

# Maximizing Savings with Additional App Features and Best Practices

The best saving money apps for 2025 go beyond simple transfers and round-ups. Today‚Äôs top tools pack in bonus features ‚Äî think cash-back offers, investment options, real-time net worth tracking, and even personalized spending insights.

If you want easy ways to save money more effectively, it pays to use these hidden features and build healthy habits right inside your favorite app.

# Cash-Back Programs: Turning Everyday Spending into Savings

Cash-back programs have become bigger and smarter in 2025. Apps like Rakuten, Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Dosh let you earn back a slice of what you spend ‚Äî often 2% to 20% or more at partner stores, with bonus offers now reaching up to 30% in some cases. Pairing these apps with cash-back credit cards multiplies your rewards.

How to get the most out of these tools:

* **Stack apps and cards**: Use more than one cash-back app per purchase plus a rewards credit card for the same buy.
* **Activate browser extensions**: Tools like Honey or Rakuten automatically apply savings and stack coupons, so you don‚Äôt leave money behind at checkout.
* **Scan receipts**: Apps like Fetch Rewards give points for purchases made anywhere, even when shopping offline.
* **Watch for promo periods**: Some retailers give extra cash back during holidays, weekend sales, or product launches ‚Äî plan bigger spends for these times.

Staying organized by linking accounts and activating push alerts keeps you from missing easy bonuses. Consistent users can collect $10‚Äì$20 a month or more, all deposited right back into your savings account.

# In-App Investment Options: Let Your Savings Grow Automatically

Many of the best cash saving apps now offer easy investment choices right alongside emergency funds and spending accounts. Options in 2025 range from round-up investing in micro-portfolios (Acorns) to higher yielding savings accounts and even in-app access to mutual funds, ETFs, and high-yield bonds.

Popular choices for hands-off investing:

* **High-yield savings and money market funds**: Earn more on parked savings with FDIC insurance.
* **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**: Lock in a rate for a fixed term, often right in-app.
* **Low-cost index and bond funds**: Diversify quickly with one click.
* **Automated recurring investing**: Set small amounts to move on a schedule, so you never miss a market opportunity.

Most apps make it easy to swap between savings and investments and show your progress with clean charts and goal tracking. Always compare fees ‚Äî many top-rated best money saving apps offer no- or low-fee funds for investors just getting started.

# Net Worth Tracking: See the Full Financial Picture

Net worth tracking features help you see not just what you save, but how much you owe, what you own, and how it all adds up. Apps like Empower, Monarch, and Rocket Money connect all your bank, credit, retirement, and investment accounts, giving instant updates on your true bottom line.

Why net worth tracking matters:

* **Motivation**: Watching debts shrink and savings grow keeps momentum high.
* **Real-time updates**: Automatic feeds mean no manual math or spreadsheets.
* **Smart goal planning**: Set a net worth target for the year and let the app break down what it takes to get there.
* **Amortization and forecast tools**: See how long until loans are paid off, or how fast savings could climb if you boost deposits.

Some of the best save money apps even let you add home and car values, international assets, or split shared finances with a partner ‚Äî everything updated automatically.

# Spending Insights and Alerts: Smarter Choices Every Day

Leading apps now analyze your spending and instantly flag opportunities to save more. Real-time insights reveal trends ‚Äî like where food delivery is draining your budget or if monthly subscriptions are stacking up. Look for features such as:

* **Monthly spend breakdowns**: Visual charts showing most-used categories and hidden fees.
* **Custom alerts**: Nudges for overspending, big purchases, low balances, or hitting a budget cap.
* **Subscription management**: See all recurring charges, get reminders, and cancel what you don‚Äôt use.

Some best money saving apps suggest simple swaps based on your behavior (swap premium coffee for homemade, or cook in more). Built-in recommendations motivate better choices ‚Äî without guilt.

# Best Practices: Make the Most of Every App Feature

Getting the full benefit from the best app for money saving isn‚Äôt about set-and-forget. Small habits boost your results:

* **Review goals monthly**: Set calendar reminders to check your progress, update priorities, and celebrate milestones.
* **Turn on push notifications and alerts**: Immediate reminders stop you from missing savings boosts or letting expenses drift.
* **Use the app‚Äôs learning resources**: Many provide short video explainers, smart finance tips, and mini-courses. Even ‚Äúpro‚Äù users find new tricks by exploring these.
* **Automate increases**: Every time you get a raise or bonus, redirect a set percentage straight into savings or investments through your app.
* **Share and compare**: Some platforms let you team up with a friend or partner, making it easier to stay motivated and accountable.

A few more tips for lasting results:

1. **Budget for inflation**¬†by nudging up savings when costs rise ‚Äî many apps let you automate this.
2. **Log spending manually when needed**¬†to stay mindful, especially for cash purchases.
3. **Revisit spending caps**¬†after big life changes (new job, move, or major purchase) and adjust your automation rules.

Stacking rewards, investing what you save, keeping an eye on the big picture, and following these routines can add hundreds of dollars ‚Äî or more ‚Äî to your year-end savings. The right strategy, plus the best cash saving apps, means technology does the heavy lifting while you reap the results.

I‚Äôm sure things are healing as they should but honestly I feel so disgusting right now between this discharge and the smell (even after a shower!) and wanted to get these thoughts out of my head but this isn‚Äôt exactly a topic anyone wants to talk about or has experience with. 

Curious how long it took others to pass all the discharge/smells and feel like everything was back to normal? I was a bit surprised it took this long for everything to start coming out, I was under the impression all  of this would be happening within the first few days following the procedure.

Morning. I wake up‚ÄîI'm finally free from school at last.

As I lie in bed, thinking about what I should do today, my mind feels blank. I get up and walk to my wardrobe.

I fall back in shock.

There‚Äôs someone‚Äîno, something‚Äîstanding right in front of me. Its features are strange, almost familiar, and horrifying. It holds its head the way I do. I'm still on the floor, but it's copying my every movement, like it's trying to be me.
I recognize it‚Ä¶ but I don't know it. I don‚Äôt know what you call something like that.
I leave the room, shaken, and head downstairs.

 I grab a bowl of cereal and a shiny, long metal thing with four tiny sharp pokey ends. It feels familiar, but I don‚Äôt know what it is but i feel like i do.

I eat. I drink. The cereal tastes good‚Äîit makes me feel like a dog.
I turn on the TV.
I see it again.

The same kind of thing I saw in my room. But now there‚Äôs more of them. And they‚Äôre not copying me. They all look different from each other.

RINGGG. RINGGG. RINGGG...

I jump at the sound and dive under the coffee table. It‚Äôs loud‚Äîalmost like a warning. I don‚Äôt know what it means, but it feels dangerous. It won‚Äôt stop ringing. I hide until it finally goes quiet.

When I crawl out, I go outside. Something‚Äôs wrong with my house‚Äîit feels‚Ä¶ off. I lock the door and shove the keys in my pocket.
The trees. The sky. Everything is vibrant. So beautiful. I keep looking around and still see the creatures‚Äîthe same ones from the TV. They don‚Äôt seem dangerous. They seem harmless.

I find a food truck. I eat. Then I go home. Maybe the danger has passed.

I put my hands in my pocket and feel something small and metal. It‚Äôs ridged, sharp‚Äîlike a tiny weapon. I don‚Äôt know why I have it‚Ä¶ but something tells me I should.

What if the higher-ups saw this? I can‚Äôt be caught carrying something like that. I throw it away and run home as fast as I can.

But the door won‚Äôt open.

Why won‚Äôt it open? Do the higher-ups know? Did they lock me out? Or‚Ä¶ are they trying to protect me from something?

A person walks up. I jump back. It‚Äôs another one of those creatures‚Äîlike the one in my room, but different.
They open the door and say, ‚ÄúCome on. Don‚Äôt stand there.‚Äù
I follow them inside.
It‚Äôs my house.

""Why didn't you pick up the phone?""
I grab the shiny metal object with the four tiny sticks again.
The creature speaks:
‚ÄúPut that down. You're dangerous.‚Äù
I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôve never hurt a soul.
‚ÄúGo to your room. Now.‚Äù
I go, hoping I won‚Äôt see that mimicking creature again. It just copies me. That‚Äôs all it ever does. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ bizarre.

The words ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dangerous‚Äù echo in my head.

I walk around my room until I see a plastic book on the floor. What‚Äôs that doing here?
I pick it up and open it.

Inside, there's the same small, sharp metal object‚Äîsealed in a ziplock bag, with dried red paint on it.

Next to it are other metal tools, labeled with different dates and names. Names that sound familiar to me.

Were these objects named after people? Or were they used on them?

I run downstairs and scream at the creature

‚ÄúWHAT AM I?!‚Äù
It smiles slowly.
And winks‚Äîwith its third eyelid.",2,1745428236.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Both styles have their undeniable charm, and knowing when to wear which can elevate your look while ensuring comfort. Whether you're dressing for work, a night out, or a relaxed weekend, let‚Äôs decode the perfect choice for every occasion.

¬†

**1. The Boardroom Battle: Power Dressing**

**Winner: Heels**

There‚Äôs no denying the authority that a sleek pair of heels brings to your office attire. Heels elongate your silhouette, enhance posture, and exude confidence. Opt for classic block heels, kitten heels, or pointed pumps to complement tailored suits, pencil skirts, or elegant dresses.

**Style Tip:** Neutral-toned heels like black, nude, or grey are versatile and perfect for formal settings.

¬†

**2. Weekend Vibes: Casual and Comfortable**

**Winner: Flats**

When it‚Äôs time to unwind, flats are your best bet. From chic loafers and stylish mules to trendy sneakers, flats ensure you stay comfortable during coffee runs, shopping sprees, or park strolls.

**Style Tip:** Add a touch of fun with embellished flats or opt for bold colors to elevate your casual ensemble.

¬†

**3. Date Night Drama: Glam and Gorgeous**

**Winner: Heels**

For a romantic evening or a glamorous party, heels add that extra flair. Strappy stilettos, metallic block heels, or sophisticated pumps can turn heads and complete your statement look.

**Style Tip:** Pair heels with bodycon dresses, sleek jumpsuits, or even tailored trousers for an elegant vibe.

¬†

**4. Travel Diaries: Exploring in Style**

**Winner: Flats**

Exploring new places calls for endless walking, and flats ensure you do so without discomfort. Trendy ballerinas, loafers, or comfortable sandals offer the support you need without compromising on style.

**Style Tip:** Pack a neutral pair of flats that match multiple outfits for easy styling on the go.

¬†

**5. Weddings & Festivities: Celebrate in Comfort**

**Winner: Both**

While heels undoubtedly offer a touch of grandeur, flats are often the practical choice for extended celebrations. Consider starting your evening in elegant heels for photos and ceremonies, then switch to embellished flats for the dance floor.

**Style Tip:** Opt for gold-toned or embroidered flats to maintain a festive look without sacrificing comfort.

¬†

**6. Everyday Office Chic: Comfort and Class**

**Winner: Both**

On days when you want to add a statement to your workwear, block heels are perfect. For a more relaxed day, loafers or pointed-toe flats provide a polished yet comfortable alternative.

**Style Tip:** Keep a versatile pair of nude flats or block heels at your workplace for unexpected meetings or events.

¬†

**Final Thoughts: The Best of Both Worlds**

The choice between heels and flats isn‚Äôt about choosing sides; it‚Äôs about embracing what works best for you. From striking stilettos to elegant loafers, La Fiza offers a curated collection to complement your every moment. Step out in confidence, whether you‚Äôre reaching for the sky in heels or keeping it grounded in flats.

How I finally got the medical care and treatment I needed.

I'm not going to discuss my prior experience in this post. If you're interested, you can read about it here:
[The impact of mental health on long covid and my experience](https://www.reddit.com/u/SophiaShay7/s/GzIBNdY0Rl)

I have five diagnoses that covid gave me, including Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, Hashimoto's disease, which causes hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. I've spent the last 16 months of my life learning everything I could about my symptoms and possible diagnoses. 

**Where did I start? It all started with research.**

Among the SSRIs, those with the highest affinity for sigma-1 receptor agonism‚Äîprimarily, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram‚Äîmay be of greatest benefit. As noted above, preliminary data suggest that certain long COVID symptoms (eg, fatigue, brain fog, and post-COVID dysphoria) may be most responsive to SSRIs, although more research is needed to better characterize specific response rates. 

[In doing research of long covid, SSRIs, and fluvoxamine, you‚Äôll see it mentioned as a top choice. Here‚Äôs one such article](https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/growing-evidence-potential-use-antidepressants-long-covid)

>...Fluvoxamine can stabilize mast cells, such that
fluvoxamine can reduce histamine release from mast cells as well as reduce cytokine storms in COVID-19.

>There is an activated condition of mast cells in long COVID-19, with abnormal granulation and excessive inflammatory cytokine release. A study by Weinstock et al. indicates that patients with long COVID-19 suffer the same clinical syndrome as patients with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). 

[Immunological dysfunction and mast cell activation syndrome in long COVID](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10166245/#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20activated%20condition,cell%20activation%20syndrome%20(MCAS).)           

**Why does long covid trigger MCAS? What is MCAS? Keep reading....**

>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is an immunological condition in which mast cells, a type of white blood cell, inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators, such as histamine, resulting in a range of chronic symptoms, sometimes including anaphylaxis or near-anaphylaxis attacks. Primary symptoms include cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory problems. MCAS can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, vertigo, cognitive dysfunction, and paresthesia. When mast cells are activated in MCAS, they release chemicals like histamine, which can impact nerve signaling, leading to sensations like tingling or numbness. Read: [MCAS and ME/CFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/s/sGU7tz6rJD)

>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is the most common form of systemic Mast Cell Disease and is known to cause Dysautonomia in some but not all patients. Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps. While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response. **Adrenaline surges trigger histamine dumps.**

>Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine are all neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and helping the brain transition from sleep to wakefulness. A histamine dump happens when your body produces too much histamine that builds up in the brain. Histamine dumps often happen late at night or early in the morning. You might suddenly feel changes in body temperature, itchiness, or blood pressure changes as your histamine levels rise. **Histamine, serotonin, and dopamine all play a role in regulating sleep-wake cycles.**

I have Paresthesia. Paresthesia (numbness and tingling sensations) is considered a common neurological symptom associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), often reported by individuals with this condition; it can manifest as tingling in various parts of the body due to the release of mast cell mediators affecting nerve function. 

I have Hyperesthesia. Hyperesthesia, a heightened sensitivity to touch or other sensory stimuli,¬†can be a symptom of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).¬†MCAS is a condition where mast cells release excessive chemicals, leading to various symptom,  including those related to heightened sensory perception to one or more of the senses, including touch, pressure, pain, temperature, light, sound, taste, and smell. I had hyperesthesia in all five senses, down to the texture of my food. 

After I developed MCAS, I followed the H1 and H2 histamine blocker protocol. I tried several H1 and H2 antihistamines. I tried taking one of each twice a day. I tried taking one of each once a day. I couldn't tolerate them. They made my tachycardia, adrenaline surges, and histamine dumps worse. They also gave me nausea. Some people like me can't tolerate the OTCs and/or can't tolerate the fillers in those medications.

**What about the tryptophan and serotonin deficiencies in long covid patients I keep reading about?**

>The researchers determined that a subset of patients with long COVID had traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool samples even months after acute COVID-19 infection, which suggests that components of the virus remain in the gut of some patients long after infection. They found that this remaining virus, called a viral reservoir, triggers the immune system to release proteins that fight the virus, called interferons. These interferons cause inflammation that reduces the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

>Tryptophan is a building block for several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, which is primarily produced in the GI tract and carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout the body. It plays a key role in regulating memory, sleep, digestion, wound healing, and other functions that maintain homeostasis within the body. Serotonin is also an important regulator of the vagus nerve, a system of neurons that mediate the communication between the body and the brain.

>The researchers found that when tryptophan absorption is reduced by persistent viral inflammation, serotonin is depleted, leading to disrupted vagus nerve signaling, which in turn can cause several of the symptoms associated with long COVID, such as memory loss.

[Viral Persistence and Serotonin Reduction Can Cause Long COVID Symptoms](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/october/penn-study-finds-serotonin-reduction-causes-long-covid-symptoms)

**What medications and supplements do I take?** 

I take low-dose Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms and Diazepam for Dysautonomia. Astelin, Hydroxyzine, and Omeprazole for MCAS. Valacyclovir 1g for EBV/HHV suppression. Tirosint 75mcg for hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto's.

I take NatureBell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex. It regulates the sleep-wake cycle. I take 2/3rds the dose. Or I take Magnesiu-OM powder (magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan) 1-2 hours before bed. I alternate between the two. I purchased them from Amazon. They significantly help with calmness, muscle cramps, pain, relaxation, and sleep.

As always, talk to your doctor before taking any GABA, 5-HTP, or L-tryptophan supplements. Especially if you're taking psychotropic medications like SSRIs.

**How have I improved?**

I have improved REM, deep sleep, and overall hours slept. I'm seeing improvements in dysautonomia symptoms and orthostatic intolerance. The dizziness and lightheadedness have significantly improved. My Paresthesia symptoms have improved. I have less numbness and tingling. My Hyperesthesia symptoms have improved. I'm able to tolerate more bright light and loud sound, and my taste and smell are significantly less heightened. I can handle warmer/hot showers. My pain is significantly less strong. My pressure sensitivities haven't lowered. However, I suspect there are other reasons for that.

I shared all this because Dysautonomia and MCAS are prevalent in long covid. It's a combination of things I do that improve my overall symptoms. Tachycardia, adrenaline dumps, histamine dumps, shortness of breath, and air hunger were among some of my worst symptoms. A low histamine diet, medications, supplements, prebiotic fiber, plenty of rest, and good sleep hygiene significantly alleviated these symptoms. 

>**THE THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED ME THE MOST:**

1. Low-dose Fluvoxamine 25mg
2. Diazepam 5mg
3. Hydroxyzine 50mg 
4. Astelin nasal spray
5. Omeprazole 40mg
6. Valacyclovir 1g
7. Tirosint 75mcg
8. Prebiotic psyllium husk
9. Emergen-C packets
10. Naturebell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex OR
11. Magnesiu-OM powder (chelated magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan)
12. Low histamine diet 
13. Intermittent fasting 10/14 or 8/16 eat/fast schedule 
14. Aggressively resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM.
15. Good sleep hygiene. Sleep 10-12 hours a night.

>**MY DIET AND INTERMITTENT FASTING:**

I completely overhauled my diet last year. I did an anti-inflammation diet. My dysautonomia and hypothyroidism caused non-diabetic nocturnal hypoglycemia attacks. I had to change my diet. I added premier protein shakes with 30 grams of protein. My favorite flavors are cake batter, cinnamon roll, lemon, and peanut butter cup. And fruit cups or applesauce without added sugar. That way, I get protein, carbohydrates, and natural sugar added into my diet. I have blueberries with peanut butter. I have low-fat cottage cheese with fruit like bananas, pineapple, or watermelon. I love salads and vegetables but I can't eat much of it. I have complex carbohydrates like whole wheat pasta and sweet potato fries. I like frozen chicken breasts and frozen precut vegetables like carrots, green beans, peas, and butternut squash. Recently, I have noticed that my symptoms are more severe than they used to be. I added more meat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates into my diet. The changes I've made include: I've added yogurt into my diet. I have potato bowls with potatoes, some shredded cheese, and canned chicken or ground beef for dinner. I was diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in September 2024. I switched to a low histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated.

I do limit processed carbohydrates, additives, and sugars. I love chocolate cake and have a slice 1-2 times a month. I have takeout 1-2 times a month. I stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. I've stopped drinking alcohol, caffeine coffee, and soda. Though, I'm adding some coffee back into my diet. No caffeine after 6pm.

I do intermittent fasting as well. I'll have an eating/fast window of: 8hr/16hr or 10hr/14hr. That's typically intermittent fasting for 14-16 hours. Some days I don't follow it. You have to keep your metabolism guessing. Our bodies get very efficient at estimating the number of calories we eat. It holds onto the calories and inhibits weight loss. I lost 40lbs last year. I've lost 10lbs this year.

>**CREATING A SCHEDULE & GOOD SLEEP HYGIENE:**

It's essential to create a routine if you're able. I wake up and go to bed within the same two hour window. 
I go to bed between 10-12am and wake up between 8am-10am. I sleep 10-12 hours a day. I created good sleep hygiene. I take my medications and supplements at the same time every day. I eat and have my snacks at the same time every day. Everything functions best when I maintain this schedule. 

>**THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I'VE LEARNED:**
                                     
1) I protect my peace by cultivating a routine. I don't think too far into the future. I focus on what I'm doing today. Though my physical health issues have changed, I respect my mind and body. I appreciate what it can do while honoring my limitations. Learning to recognize my mental and physical cues helps with resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM.                                              
2) Working on my mental health is crucial. I struggled with mental health issues in my journey to being diagnosed. I've taken medications and done counseling in the past to deal with those things. I thought those issues were resolved. However, becoming catastrophically disabled by COVID-19 has traumatized me. I'm going through the stages of grief. Based on my ME/CFS specialists' recommendation, I'm starting trauma therapy.                                                    
3) Smaller snack-sized meals work better for me 3-5 a day. Focus on more protein, natural carbohydrates, and natural sugar.                                                                                                                                     
4) Stay hydrated. Add electrolytes if needed. Limit or avoid alcohol, caffeine, coffee, and soda intake.                                                                                
5) Invest in a high-quality multivitamin and a few selected supplements. Add one at a time. It's easier to tell if your vitamins and supplements are helping or hurting you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6) Use your doctors as resources. Don't take any medications without research and investigation yourself. Add medications one at a time, if possible. Medications can worsen existing symptoms, cause adverse reactions and/or side effects. I believe in taking the least amount of medications and supplements to manage my symptoms.                                 
7) Create a schedule and good sleep hygiene. I created a schedule for taking my medications and supplements, eating, and sleeping. It can take a while to achieve this. It's about progress, not perfection. Be kind to yourself.                                                                          
8) Mental health and mindset are important. I find things to laugh about every day. Gratitude is so important. Acceptance of my medical limitations and reality is essential. It doesn't mean I'm without hope. If I can achieve a 30-50% improvement in my overall symptoms, I'll consider it a win. I have a supportive and loving husband. I have lots of fur babies. They make me laugh every day.                                                 
9) Box breathing, meditation, and Yoga Nidra are beneficial at any level. If you're mild or moderate, you may he able to handle pilates, yoga, walks, and weight training. Always go at your own pace.                                                                                                             
10) Find things that occupy your time. Be aware of your sensory overstimulation issues. I watch TV shows and movies on my cell phone with the brightness and volume turned down. I use an earplug in one ear and a noise canceling earbud in the other. I watch things that are funny, engaging, and/or distracting. I often have something streaming with the volume barely audible. It's like white noise to me. I can't tolerate silence. It makes my thoughts spiral.                          

I was diagnosed Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and Hashimotos disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. All diagnosed after I developed long covid. I am severe and have been bedridden for 16 months. Many of my symptoms have significantly improved. My journey hasn't been linear. I didn't see any improvement until month 14. However, I finally have a regimen that works for me. I've improved 20% based on symptoms alone. I hope my journey gives hope to others who are severe like me.

1k64dvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1k64dvo/overheard_a_disappointing_conversation/,Overheard a disappointing conversation‚Ä¶,"This weekend when we were at my in-laws house my MIL, two SIL, and BIL, were in the family room chatting.  I was in a loft area above the family room.  They saw me go up there, but I‚Äôm not sure if they remembered I was there. I was up there because I didn‚Äôt feel well and just needed to rest.   I wasn‚Äôt meaning to eavesdrop.  

Anyway, the conversation turns to the new garments, which is really triggering for me.  My SIL says, ‚Äúguys I accidentally watched some anti stuff. They were taking about the new garments and it was so stupid.  The women were saying how women are suffering in their garments.‚Äù She proceeds to imitate what the women said in a whiny,nasally voice and repeatedly said how stupid it was.  I‚Äôm fairly certain she watched a clip or short from the Mormon Stories garment episode.  Her whole attitude towards these women and ex-mos was so disappointing to me.  They all start talking about how if women don‚Äôt want to wear their garments, they just shouldn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt need to make excuses.  They are all so unaware or don‚Äôt care about how deep this issue really is.  

The other SIL the room doesn‚Äôt wear her garments, drinks occasionally, and drinks coffee, but still goes to church. She was agreeing with all this and said, ‚Äúpeople need to just leave the church and be done with it. ‚Äú This was especially hurtful because I have had in depth conversations with her about the church and how hurt I‚Äôve been. I have told her I have a hard time letting it all go and leaving the church alone.  It didn‚Äôt seem like the same person talking. 

I am wondering how to be close with people I know have these opinions about people like me who have left the church? I love my in-laws. I am so hurt and disappointed. I have good, close relationships with them.  Now I feel like I‚Äôve seen their true colors with the way they were making fun of people who have left.  I am really hesitant to continue being close with them. Am I being dramatic or too sensitive? This wasn‚Äôt specifically about me, but in a way it was.  

I want to leave the church and leave it alone.  Believe me.  How do I do that? I feel like I am so hurt and angry that I can‚Äôt just ignore it.  ",23,1745427799.0,exmormon,11,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal 17-inch laptop bag shoudl offer a variety of features to ensure the safe and agreeable transport of your laptop and othre essentials. Here's an analysis of the key features to consider when choosing the right bag for you.

**Laptop compartment Padding:** The level of padding on a laptop compartment is crucial in preventing damage to the laptop itself. A high-quality 17-inch laptop bag should have a dedicated,padded compartment with thick cushioning on all sides,especially the bottom,to protect against accidental drops or impacts during transit. The best bags use a combination of foam and air cell technology to maximize shock absorption.

The thickness of the padding should be at least 0.5 inches and ideally, around 1 inch for superior protection.Additionally, some bags feature adjustable dividers, which allow for a snug fit for laptops of various sizes within the 17-inch range; offering even more secure portability by reducing internal movement.

**Material Durability:** The choice of material considerably impacts a bag's durability and resistance to wear and tear. Popular materials include ballistic nylon, polyester, and leather. Ballistic nylon is known for its remarkable strength and abrasion resistance, making it an excellent choice for heavy-duty use. high-density polyester is a more affordable option that still provides good durability and water resistance. Premium leather offers a classic and professional look but typically requires more maintenance.

The denier (D) rating of the material indicates its thickness and density; higher denier values translate to greater durability. As an example, 1680D ballistic nylon is significantly more durable than 600D polyester. Look for reinforced stitching and durable zippers, too. Weather-resistant coatings are also a plus to help protect your belongings from rain and spills.

**Storage Capacity and organization:** Beyond the laptop compartment, a well-designed 17-inch laptop bag should offer ample storage and organizational features. Multiple compartments, pockets, and dividers are essential for keeping your belongings neatly organized and easily accessible. Key features to look for include dedicated tablet pockets, document sleeves, accessory pouches, and pen loops.

Consider the number and size of the pockets that your specific peripherals like power adapters, mice, or external hard drives require. Some bags may even have specialized pockets for items like water bottles, umbrellas, or headphones. Quick-access pockets on the exterior of the bag are also useful for storing items you need to grab quickly, such as your phone, wallet, or keys.

**Comfort and Ergonomics:** The comfort of carrying a 17-inch laptop bag, especially when fully loaded, is critical, particularly for those constantly on the go. Look for bags with padded shoulder straps,a breathable back panel,and a sternum strap to distribute weight evenly and reduce strain.Adjustable straps are also critically important for achieving a comfortable and secure fit.Some backpack-style bags feature ergonomic designs that contour to the shape of your back, providing better support and reducing pressure points.For messenger bags, consider a wide and adjustable shoulder strap with a padded shoulder pad to prevent digging into your shoulder. Briefcases often include a padded handle and a detachable shoulder strap for added versatility.

**Security Features:** In an increasingly interconnected world, a laptop bag should provide adequate security features to protect your device and personal facts from theft and unauthorized access.Look for bags with lockable zippers, hidden pockets, and RFID-blocking technology. Lockable zippers can deter opportunistic thieves, while hidden pockets can provide a secure place to store valuables such as your passport, wallet, or phone.

RFID-blocking material can protect your credit cards and ID cards from electronic theft. Some bags also feature a tracking device or a designated slot for an RFID tracker, allowing you to locate your bag if it is lost or stolen. Additionally, tamper-proof zippers and slash-resistant materials are increasingly popular features that provide an extra layer of security.

**Aesthetics and Style:** While functionality is paramount, the aesthetic appeal of a 17-inch laptop bag is also important, especially for professionals who need to project a polished and professional image. Choose a bag that complements your personal style and workplace environment. Options range from sleek and minimalist designs to more rugged and utilitarian styles.

Leather bags exude a certain level of sophistication, while nylon or polyester bags offer a more modern and sporty look. Consider the color,shape,and overall design of the bag when making your selection. Many bags are available in a variety of colors and finishes,allowing you to customize your look. A logo that is too prominent or numerous external straps and buckles can detract from a bag's professional appearance.

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Protection:** A padded laptop compartment safeguards your valuable device from bumps, scratches, and drops. For instance, users who frequently commute on public transportation will appreciate the added protection against jostling and accidental impacts, preventing potential damage that could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars to repair.

**improved Organization:** Multiple compartments and pockets keep your accessories, documents, and personal items neatly organized and easily accessible. With designated spaces for devices like tablets and phones, professional items like pens and notebooks, and personal things like keys or wallets; important things can be easily located when needed.

**Increased Comfort:** Padded shoulder straps, a breathable back panel, and adjustable straps ensure comfortable carrying, even when the bag is fully loaded. This alleviates strain and fatigue; crucial for people who have to carry everything all day long. For example, students walking to and from class or professionals traveling for business will benefit from the ergonomic design that distributes weight evenly and reduces pressure points.

**Professional Appearance:** A sleek and stylish design projects a professional image, making it a suitable accessory for business meetings, conferences, and other formal settings. This contributes to a professional image, which can be important for building credibility and making a positive first impression.

**Increased Security:** Lockable zippers and RFID-blocking technology can definately help protect your laptop and personal information from theft and unauthorized access. By keeping the user's personal information safe, the laptop bag offers some peace of mind.for example, frequent travelers will appreciate the added security features that guard against electronic pickpocketing and physical theft in crowded airports or train stations.

A new therapist I'm seeing said I am in the middle ground of ADHD (definitely have symptoms but not 100% if that makes sense); she suggested I try Wellbutrin for helping to give me the extra executive functioning push I need to self start. I haven't taken it yet, but have the prescription. I grew up with parents that never rested and viewed productivity as everything, also the whole ""just eat healthy and do a workout to feel better"" people. Love them, but it has left me feeling lazy or ""less disciplined"" because I literally cannot keep a clean house, stay on top of things, or start/finish tasks. As I type this, my coffee is in the microwave probably cold again because I forgot it was there (lol).

Anyway, I think I'm dealing with my own mental hurdles of the stigma around being on medication, especially since I'm already on Lexapro. It feels like I should be able to ""do or think"" my way into functioning better bc that's how I was raised, so I guess I'm just looking for encouragement, stories, or advice on the other side of being on medication. <3",1,1745427290.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

1k644t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k644t3/why_choose_the_junvpic_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Why Choose the JunVpic Cold Brew Coffee Maker Discover a Detailed Review,"The JunVpic IPL Ger√§te Haarentfernung Cold Brew Coffee Maker really caught my eye with its sleek and practical design. As someone who experiments with various coffee equipment daily, I was excited to try it out. What I found was a compact yet versatile device that brought both convenience and a touch of elegance to my kitchen. The product didn‚Äôt just meet expectations; it brought some unexpected joys and a couple of challenges worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this coffee maker strikes a balance between style and functionality. Made from heavy-duty soda-lime glass, it has a premium feel right out of the box. The gray color adds a modern touch, and the rounded shape fits comfortably in my hands. I appreciate that the pitcher has a good weight to it (2.31 pounds), which makes it feel solid without being cumbersome. That ergonomic handle? It‚Äôs sturdy enough to handle a full pitcher of iced coffee without so much as a creak. However, its 4.4-inch width means it‚Äôs somewhat snug when placing it in an overcrowded fridge. 

**Multi-Purpose Filter Performance**  
One standout feature is the high-quality mesh filter. This element is essential for a smooth cold brew experience, and it lived up to the hype by effectively keeping out coffee grounds. As an added bonus, the filter also works beautifully for filtering tea leaves or fruit pits, making it more than just a cold brew maker. I could whip up iced teas and infuse water with fruit with minimal hassle. That said, the filter can demand a bit of extra effort during cleaning, primarily when making denser brews that leave behind micro-particles.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
If you‚Äôre someone who hates the clean-up stage after a good brew, this cold brew pitcher has got you covered. The wide-mouth opening is a game changer! The ability to fit my hand into the pitcher simplified scrubbing away any stubborn stains or residual coffee oils. When I lacked motivation for a thorough clean, shaking the jar with some soapy water worked surprisingly well. But here's a minor quibble: while the glass resists breakage, you‚Äôll want to handle it with extra care during washing, especially if you plan to store it in precarious spaces later.

**Strengths**  
- High-quality soda-lime glass ensures longevity and safety.  
- Versatile filter supports not just coffee but also tea and infused drinks.  
- Wide-mouth jar simplifies cleaning, while the ergonomic handle adds to the convenience.  

[Check JunVpic IPL Ger√§te Haarentfernung price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bnn7ggkr/)  

**Sturdy Sealing System**  
One of the features that genuinely impressed me was the airtight design. The pitcher‚Äôs lid and ring create a tight seal that prevents any unwanted leaks or spills. Once, I accidentally knocked the jar on its side in the fridge, and not a single drop escaped. Additionally, the sealing system ensures no odd fridge smells seep into your brew. However, over the weeks, I noticed that the flip-top lid became slightly looser with frequent use. A quick adjustment fixed the issue, but it‚Äôs worth noting if you‚Äôre planning to use this as heavily as I do.

**Weaknesses**  
- Filters fine, but cleaning micro-particles requires extra care.  
- Flip-top lid might loosen slightly with consistent use over time.  

**Convenience for Daily Use**  
What really makes this cold brew coffee maker practical is its overall convenience. The spout, designed to prevent leaks, lived up to its reputation. No splashes or awkward pours with this pitcher. I was even able to experiment with homemade lemonade and fresh fruit punches, which poured seamlessly every time. Adding to this is the comfortable grip of the ergonomic handle. It stood up to the weight of freshly brewed coffee effortlessly. Long-term users will particularly love how well it accommodates drinks that require vigorous stirring or shaking to blend.

**Competing Products**  
There‚Äôs no shortage of cold brew coffee makers on the market, so I made comparisons with a couple of popular brands. In contrast to the more utilitarian designs of the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Maker, the JunVpic stands out for its elegant glass build and multi-purpose use. However, brands like OXO provide more advanced brewing systems at a higher cost, with features like better filtration technology. On the downside, OXO‚Äôs bulky size and higher price point might deter casual users. If value and simplicity are at the forefront of your needs, this one‚Äôs a strong contender.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
Considering all its features, the price point is definitely justifiable. While competitors with similar designs occasionally feel overpriced for what they offer, this coffee maker strikes a good balance between quality and affordability. Its long-term durability is another plus, ensuring you won‚Äôt have to replace it anytime soon unless you‚Äôre clumsy with glass products. Even though it falls short on cutting-edge technology some high-end models provide, for straightforward and effective cold brews, it‚Äôs an efficient investment.

We were talking about this with my friends (Both guys and girls) and I don't think that people right now who have attraction to celebrities (people who win millions, who will you never see also) can get a real partner because it just warps the brain and rises the standards unnecessarily. 

I mean, back in 90s and earlier I guess people still had crushes on celebrities but there was no social media and it was presumably a personal thing. But right now teenagers are simping on actors, actresses, singers so much. I don't think any guy who posts or comments about Margot Robbie or will ever get to date with a more down to earth girl? Nearly all Guys who idolize ""Literally me"" characters have a hivemind crush on Ana de Armas and they already tell themselves that they don't interact with women in real life.

1k63xsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1k63xsb/local_milk_delivery/,Local milk delivery,"I am curious your thoughts on whether there would be enough demand for a business that does local milk delivery in glass bottles.

I used to have glass bottle milk delivery as a kid and it was a nice part of my family‚Äôs routine to put the cooler out one night a week and then fill up the fridge with fresh milk the next morning. Now as an adult, I would prefer to buy glass bottles of milk from the store because it‚Äôs more sustainable, but these are often much more expensive because the cost of shipping glass and the bottle deposit that you‚Äôd inevitably not get back.

My idea would be to create a membership program where people sign up for weekly milk deliveries, and whatever they pay in a bottle deposit would be credited on their next delivery. They would leave their empty bottles in a cooler outside and we would replace it with their order. Then sanitize the bottles and reuse them.Would ideally start with regular cow‚Äôs milk, but could expand to alternative milks, juices, and cold brew coffees ‚Äî all your morning beverage needs!

I think this could be a good fit for families with young children who drink a lot of milk and don‚Äôt want to run out, plus younger people without cars who do not want to lug one of the heaviest items to and from the grocery store and care about sustainability and/or convenience. But I‚Äôm concerned this market may be squeezed out by the grocery delivery chains now offering delivery‚Ä¶ and not sure if I could be cost competitive vs the big dairy manufacturers in the store.

I know this concept already exists in a number of towns, but curious if people think this could work on a larger scale in a city with a mix of apartments and dense residential homes.

I need your help because I am very stuck, confused, and feel that my career is over. I will try to keep this short and simple. I have always wanted to work in International Relations/ Public Policy/ Government, etc. but under different circumstances my path always went in different directions. I am an EU/soon to be US citizen who has 3 U.S. degrees - B.S. in Architecture (full ride), top Master of Architecture (HYP Ivy League ‚Äì full ride), and MBA (Top 20 ‚Äì almost full ride). I worked for 5 years as an architect before my MBA and I was mostly excited about my affordable housing and sustainability projects but really wanted to learn about capital raising and finance. So, I decided I will go to Wall Street (did an Investment Banking internship and Private Equity and became good at finance) but have never felt more unfulfilled and left. I also recruited and interviewed with the MBB consulting firms but I wasn‚Äôt good enough due to limited casing. I am a recent grad and completed a consulting bootcamp where I was the top student and now I know how to case but recruiting is very difficult as a non-student. I am not interested in increasing corporate America‚Äôs profits but rather provide services that improve people‚Äôs lives. I have never felt so empty working in corporate America.  
I know you will think I am crazy but I am considering of pursuing a 3^(rd) Masters in IR, MPP, MPA. I want to work in any capacity for international organizations, public sector consulting, government organizations, anything ‚Äì as long as I have the impact on citizens. Just for the fun of it, I got an offer for the Blue Book Traineeship at the European Commission last year but didn‚Äôt do it. I was a political PR in my teenage years, expert on public policy and infrastructure (mainly housing policy) for a leading political party in my home country, and youth expert for a leading think-thank. 

My business school and architecture networks are not in the fields I want to get in. I could  do coffee chats but I feel that I need the degree credential and school network to get my foot in the door. On-campus recruiting seems be the way.

To sum up: 2 top architecture degrees, Top 20 U.S. MBA, 5 years architecture + business development experience and 1 year high finance, mid 30‚Äôs looking for getting a Master‚Äôs in international relations, policy, public sector work and transition to those fields.  
  
My questions:

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Am I too old for my 3^(rd) career switch? Am I too crazy? Would recruiters think I am confused about my career path?

2)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Should I pursue a 3^(rd) Masters degree? I was looking at 1-year programs such as JHU SAIS, 1-year Master of Advanced Global Studies at SciencesPo or similar at LSE, OxBridge? I am thinking of going to Europe this time instead of the U.S. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt have debt as I have always received generous financial aid. 

3)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Would my 2 Master‚Äôs degrees be sufficient to break in any role? 

4)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What career paths would you recommend?  
  
Any advice or words would help me! Please, do not think that I am crazy. I am just very multi-disciplinary, more of a generalist type person and can really contribute to the world in meaningful ways.

1k63roi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k63roi,The BIG Picture : Part 5,"


 Sorry I had planned on getting this out last night but my brain needed a break. Shout out again to this community, the connections you guys are making really blows my mind. Typos are a given. In order to really get the big picture I really do encourage reading my past posts in this series but I understand it's a lot to read and digest (it was a lot for me to write so I get it). I would also like to reiterate that it's not my goal to say definitively what anything means or alludes to because a lot of this is nuanced and I'll be honest has me pretty confused and conflicted myself. I am not an expert by any means and acknowledge there are a lot of things and references I am sure to miss or forget. I encourage you to follow these rabbit holes with me as there may also be context I am missing


Link to part 4 from yesterday

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/mUEReNTloY

And to part 2 because this is where I first introduce Virgil and how integral he is to whatever the hell is going on. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/ynwd1Jj1uL

Time to take a trip on the dark side of the moon

I want to start off by dropping what feels like a HUGE revelation that we made in the daily chat a couple of days ago (Shout out to the homies)

In part 2 of this series a revalation was made that Virgil fits the description of off white sunseeker at the marina, fuck a phantom I like to buy yachts when I get the fever (lyrics in 6:16in LA) 

So I was poking through Virgils Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/virgilabloh?igsh=ZmI2cTFrMnNtMHhm) trying to learn more when I stumbled upon this picture posted October 29th 2021 (just days after Drakes birthday)

PICTURE 1

So immediately the first thing that stood out to me was the emblem on the plate because i knew that to be none other than Caviar Kaspia, yes that Caviar Kaspia.. the one involved in the teddy weintraub drama, the one with all the rumors surrounding menu items and underage drinking. Also the caption  stood out to me because of the OW LV which si short for off white Louis Vuitton but I immediately read it as OWL..V

PICTURE 2


So then when sharing this with the class they pointed out that not only was his background a dark side of the moon reference (which is often paired with wizard of oz) but it was pointed out the time was freaking 6:16

So not only do we have lyric references likely pointing to Virgil but now the song title too??

The one that was only released via Instagram with possible hidden files.. like file systems of coffee...

Face melt has commenced..

Now for the LA part, I'm not sure, the post which has several photos is tagged in Paris, with the date on this picture being October 27th but was shown to be in NY on October 29th when this was posted and per this flyer was set to DJ in NY that day https://ra.co/events/1446985

Virgil passed away about a month later

What does it all mean?!?! Seriously. Help needed, this feels like we are close..

So let's back up a little bit because now this is really starting to feel like an ARG or large scale scavenger hunt.. (Atlanta s4 ep1, I'm telling you)

Let's talk a little about Virgil. 

""Virgil Abloh was a Ghanaian-American fashion designer, artist, architect, and DJ who broke boundaries and collaborated across creative fields. Abloh, who trained as an architect, founded the luxury streetwear brand Pyrex Vision in 2012, which became the Milan-based label Off-White in 2013. In 2018, he became the first Black person to lead Louis Vuitton's menswear as Artistic Director. Abloh was instrumental in establishing streetwear in high fashion. ""


I would also like to note that he and Kanye were friends before they both hit it big in their respective fields so their relationship goes back a ways and collaborated on a lot leading up to Virgils passing but I will go more into that later if I'm not worn out by then.

So here is a portion of Virgils website which basicly lines out his initiatives and various collections (I highly highly recommend exploring this and the accompanying links), you should also check out his various installations and art design such as the lv shipping container invitation, and the one that gives severance calm down room vibes (not linking pictures but if you look they are there)

https://www.virgilabloh.com/skyscraper/

You'll see baccarat, which some have tied to drakes chandelier...
https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/oCw65ulJa6

You'll also see three icons st the top that are taking you to the moon....but that's just how I feel

Picture 3

Now back to the sky scraper I noticed the figure skating one toward the top and didn't think anything of it at the time until u/Bright-Credit6974 turned me on to one of Virgils companies Instagram accounts For his archive Figure Skating and noted some of the pics look like they were ripped by Drakes finsta plottttwist (which recently has been seemingly used to taunt some people but
That's just an opinion)

https://www.instagram.com/figure_______skating?igsh=MXJydG5vbmd2anI5bA==

https://www.instagram.com/plottttwistttttt?igsh=eHZqYnVqd3Z3Zm83

But while digging through figure skating at first it looks just really random and alot of a guy with the same green hair as Frank but also like these pictures are trying to tell a story all their own.. maybe trying to point people to things or ideas..but you guys know I'm crazy..

But let's take this one for instance

PICTURE 4

You have Mickey Mouse bringing in a Trojan Horse with the caption Alaska from April 2022

Which immediately made me think of how pharrell is using songs in kids movies to diss drake, as recently as last year with the song Double Life which on the surface really is it's own entendre.. double life.. masks... you get where I'm going..but with hiding disses in children's movies you can explain these away as Figures of Speech (Another Virgil initiative) wouldn't you say?

https://genius.com/Pharrell-williams-double-life-lyrics

https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/816069-pharrell-seemingly-disses-drake-new-single-double-life-hip-hop-news


But then I also remembered that Tyler did the songs for The animated Grinch movie in 2018.. and is narrated by pharrell..

And Pharrell did the lego move of his life which also features Kendrick..

Pharrell did the beat and voiced the alrights in Kendricks song Alright

Pharrell took over in Virgils position at Louis Vuitton

And has ongoing beef with Drake who then purchased his jewlery at an auction and threatened to melt it all down in a song

https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/pharrell-drake-disses-jewelry-2024-1235828342/

Fun fact, Pharrell has chromastesia, as does Frank which means they see colors with sounds. Sounds amazing..

So then after scrolling even further I found this Picture also from 2022 and it kind of gave me goosebumps..

PICTURE 5

The last line.. ""Carti is the dark night of all this""

So then I'm like holy crap right.. kendricks feature on Good Credit... you know the one about the patek being flooded? And emerald cuffs for his and her?

Because if you scroll down far enough you'll see a picture of the freaking Emerald watch Virgil designed on what I assume to be Drakes hand

PICTURE 6

You guys I'm telling you, to scroll through this IG, you'll see pictures of the Simi valley house of books that Kendrick has been filing at, reference to franks Homer chain and a lot of really Spooky stuff.. like even diddy and aliyah last supper images..

Okay so now let's double back a little bit and check out Alaska Alaska. Which is again another of Virgils websites that seems to have been planned to come out posthumously. Per the website it won't fully launch until May 2025 (dead in the middle of tornado season, iykyk)

https://alaska---alaska.com/

On here not only can you access a very curious manifesto that was last updated November of 24.. but you can also access the projects carried out by Alaska Alaska...so according to this and the Alaska Alaska website not only did this company do Air Drake but they also did the design for Baby Keems tour for Melodic blue!!! Holy crap right?!?

PICTURE 7 & 8

The same melodic blue that's like channel orange? On the rainbow dock?!? 

So okay what the heck.. so then I'm like ready to check out Alaska Alaskas instagram because there's gotta be more stuff there right?!?

And one of the first things I noticed was this picture featuring a book designed by Alaska Alaska for artist Lauren Halsey of her work.. and I'm like okay where did I see this name *tour spoiler

Oh shit.. on the set for GNX tour.. the background is her art...

Picture 9 & 10

Not only is there this connection but I also learned she designed a vinyl cover for a limited re-release version of TPAB

https://thevinylfactory.com/news/tpap-vinyl/

Whoooaa...

Okay so I went back to the IG and found again another link

Picture 11

For a movie called fifth element and noticed the Chanel logo..

This movie stars Mila Jovovich and it's been discussed how Kendrick invokes a photo shoot of hers in the NLU canvas pushup scene

https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/s/JM8mTyXn8a

The synopsis of 5th element is interesting

PICTURE 12

element.. dna... 

But also because it sounds really similar to a show called continuum.. which is about a woman traveling to the past to save the future.. and if you watched the super bowl interview Kendrick did.. in my eyes in the beginning he did a foot stomp on the word continuum and even looked at the camera..
 Starting around 1 min 10 sec

https://youtu.be/ZoM6bpr2GH4?si=CnuVT2Rm2KWRbTuY

But I digress.. anyway.. so what does it all mean? Not me.  That's for sure.. my head hurts..

But in conclusion I want to give one final thing to chew on.. no one person is either all good or all bad.. aligning yourself with a person good or bad could mean a multitude of things..  even with Kendrick who has made a point to tell us this.. and that could very well be the case with Virgil.. there's been a lot of talk about him and a lot of weird alignments that really make you wonder.. what's the deal with Virgil...

u/wheredoesbabbycakes did a great breakdown of this in the daily chat and I invite them to add any context they are willing to share in the comments..

Just remember not to let your biases cloud your judgement..

That's all I have for now.. I might do a breakdown of more references like with Taylor swift and Zoe Kravitz with blink twice and maybe severance but for now I will be taking a much needed break.. ",27,1745426312.0,DarkKenny,6,1.0,False

I think the obvious conservative shift has less to do with us and what makes sense and more to do with what's going on with the current administration.
As almost everyone knows, coffee is an import only resource since it can only be grown in the coffee belt. With the constant looming threat on tariffs and the simple fact that most corporations are going to be willing to snub their work force for profits it's very clear that this dress code shift and coffee house experience shift has everything to do with keeping their customer base pleased (not raising the prices, welcoming them in) and the administration pleased by following the lead of most of corporate America. 
That really leads me to hoping that these changes won't last longer than necessary and that this is just our new reality until the enforcement relaxes.

-Totally agree‚Äîimagining Kurzgesagt‚Äôs crisp infographics floating all around you in VR is kind of mind‚Äëblowing. Picture their colorful birds guiding you through a solar‚Äësystem model you can actually walk around, or letting you ‚Äúzoom‚Äù inside a cell at room‚Äëscale.

A few ways this could become reality (or at least VR‚Äëreality):
	1.	360¬∞ ‚Äúimmersive episodes.‚Äù Kurzgesagt could render their existing animations as full‚Äësphere videos‚Äîsimilar to YouTube‚Äôs 360 format‚Äîso you can look anywhere while the narration plays. This is the quickest path: no interactivity, but the sense of presence is powerful.
	2.	Interactive museum‚Äëstyle experiences. Using Unity/Unreal, they could build explorable environments for topics like black holes or evolution. Think touch‚Äëto‚Äëexpand data layers, mini‚Äësimulations you can manipulate, and Easter‚Äëegg trivia hidden behind objects.
	3.	Mixed‚Äëreality overlays. On headsets like Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest 3, their signature graphics could appear in your own room‚Äîe.g., the Birds pop up to explain CRISPR while a giant DNA helix floats above your coffee table.
	4.	Collaborations with existing educational VR hubs. Platforms such as‚ÄØENGAGE,‚ÄØVRChat worlds, or OpenXR‚Äëbased museums already host science content; Kurzgesagt assets could slot right in.

What exists today?
	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs a fan‚Äëmade VRChat world that re‚Äëcreates pieces of the ‚ÄúScale of the Universe‚Äù video‚Äîyou can stroll from quarks to galaxies.
	‚Ä¢	Some unofficial 360 re‚Äërenders of Kurzgesagt episodes circulate on YouTube, but they‚Äôre low‚Äëres and not interactive.

Roadblocks & solutions
	‚Ä¢	Asset overhaul: Their 2D art must be rebuilt in 3D or layered parallax, which is time‚Äëintensive. Stylized low‚Äëpoly models could keep the aesthetic without blowing up file sizes.
	‚Ä¢	Narrative pacing: VR audiences need agency; scripts have to branch or breathe. ‚ÄúHotspots‚Äù that trigger voice‚Äëover only when you look at or touch something solve this.
	‚Ä¢	Platform fragmentation: Building once in OpenXR (the cross‚Äëplatform standard) then exporting to Quest, SteamVR, and VisionOS minimizes porting pain.

If Kurzgesagt ever opens a Patreon stretch goal for VR, I‚Äôm pledging immediately. Meanwhile, trying 360‚Äëvideo conversions or the fan VRChat world is the closest we can get. What science topic would you want to step into first?

	2.	Neuronal Fireworks

I suffered from GERD for 3 years with extreme burns every single day, it started way before but very slowly and unnoticed (due to bad habits, stress and weak sphincter) then it went out severely with burns, sore throat, regurgitation, loss of voice, short of breath, palpitations and chest pain (since your esophagus and heart share a connection via a nerve, don't stress it's not your heart, just the nerve signal) and I lost a lot of weight, I was miserable and it really ruined my days.

In the beginning I was taking Gaviscon (antacids) and Omeprazole (PPI), eventually I stopped Omeprazole after four months on/off (it's very bad long term and it's not really a solution to the problem), I used Gaviscon for the whole first two years, for every day the moment I feel the burn and before I sleep, but with time I felt it didn't help me a lot.

I tried everything, many things I can't say (the words are banned), just eating vegetables, not drinking water during my meals, eating 3 hours before I sleep, not eating processed food and drinks, most of these didn't work for me in the moment BUT some of it is extremely crucial in the long run, especially eating clean food and eating 3-4 hours before sleep, these two are the most important in the long run (you need discipline but the effects will show up after months, that's the way you will live all your life).

After two years of suffering, I moved completely from a ""first world"" country to a developing Mediterranean one for work and personal reasons, I directly felt a difference after a couple of weeks and I think the warm weather and a low stress environment plays an immense role (slower life pace and more genuine social life, compared to the fast, busy, cold, expensive and tiring country where I was before), also the food was more organic and cheaper, dishes are delicious while being healthy, cooking is done with olive oil and even eating outside is less expensive with a lot of healthy options, but still I was suffering from GERD but the severity diminished just by changing the environment (not instantly, it took some time).

During that year I switched from Gaviscon when I feel pain, to using natural Liquorice sticks which I found way more effective (BE CAREFUL if you have Hypertension ask your doctor ! I used it when burn arise and just before I sleep, also you should increase your potassium intake with potatoes, bananas, avocados, spinach.. ).  
And for a whole year I was very disciplined :  
\-eating clean (no processed food or snacks)  
\-using Liquorice with caution  
\-I also started drinking Chamomile infusions every day especially in the morning and at night.  
\-I removed any medications (safe in my case)  
\-I ate 3-4 hours before I sleep every single time, and slept mostly on my right side.  
\-I avoided the foods that increased my GERD especially hard to digest foods like rice  
\-I also avoided anything with a lot of tomato sauce (especially processed sauce)  
\-I avoided soda's, fried food and liquid type of food (soups, compotes, porridges)  
\-I avoided chocolate and some dairy (not all)  
\-I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol  
\-I also avoided coffee and drank black or green tea instead

Month after month the symptoms went away in stages (it never disappear in one go, it's a slow process) eventually it disappeared (took a year and a half after I moved)

I'm now GERD free for about two years, but you need to still be somewhat disciplined with what you eat and when you sleep.

For my case, I think stress, years of bad habits that didn't suit my body (A lot of tomato sauce, rice, pizza, sleeping directly after I eat, daily intake of coffee and chocolate...) and of course genetically having a weak sphincter, and to heal all of those years it takes months if not years.

Everyone is different and not all GERD's are the same, the things I avoided are the things that increased my GERD by personal experience, you should understand what triggers yours and try to avoid them along the way, you don't have to stop enjoying food, but you need to be very consistent with good habits.

GERD for me was a curse both mental and physical, but also the hidden savior that forced discipline and good habits into my life. hope it helps someone out there !

edit : I had also bad breath (I was told many times), to solve that I bought a tongue scraper never knew it existed before and it helps a lot, also I stay hydrated maybe bring a small bottle of water with you, with of course normal hygiene routines (brush, floss..), just changing your diet will improve also your breath (less burping, less fermentation, no dry mouth...)",3,1745425714.0,GERD,6,1.0,False

I'm 40, recently dxed with ASD and ADHD. I've struggled all my life. As a kid, I hated being around other kids. They made too much noise. They smelled. They talked about the most stupid shit imaginable. I wanted to talk about dinosaurs and books, not MTV. Ugh.

I had no friends, but that was fine. As long as I kept my grades up, nobody cared. Smart girls are weird. Everyone in my orbit--my parents, my teachers, etc--was convinced I'd go on to do ""great things."" A career. That's what I was destined for! I used to imagine myself as an adult with a nice, cushy job where I'd make big bucks using my humongous brain. I'd never need a husband or kids. I wouldn't need other people at all--I was smart, and so I'd use my brain to get what I needed out of life, which was (and is): respect from like-minded peers and enough money to live independently so that I could pursue my interests. 

(I often imagined myself, during my teen years, as a floating brain that was, due to bad luck or bad voodoo or a particularly spineless God, attached to my spinal cord, and thus to my body. How I longed to be a brain in a jar, free of obligations, free to think and think and think, all day long, for all eternity, Amen.)

My big brain got me into a decent college on scholarship, and my parents found me an apartment that I could have all to myself. My dreams had just started to bloom: I had a room all to myself, and nothing to do except read and study and think and think and think. 

But at some point, I realized that this was unfair. My father worked overtime so that I could live alone. The least I could do was pick up a part-time job. 

That's when things fell apart. You'd think a brainiac could stock shelves. Or serve coffee. But I've been fired from every job I've ever had, all seventeen of them, within the first six months. The reasons for my termination were all the same. Poor attitude. Not a team player. Needs to smile more. 

Luckily, I charmed a young fellow who was into the same things I was and who didn't have trouble holding down a job. I loved him and he loved me, and he loved talking about dinosaurs and books. He didn't mind that I couldn't hold down a job. He was willing to support me as long as I kept house and kept working on myself. A fine arrangement. A good one, even. 

But here I am now: forty, jobless, aimless, burnt out. We had a child, but I have little else to show for myself. The other moms in my orbit have had more children to care for, or they've moved on and restarted their careers. But I'm still stuck. Not because of our daughter. She's autistic, too, but she's far more independent than I was at her age. We have in-school support and therapists up the wazoo. She's fine. I should be fine, too.

But I'm not, because what happened to that version of myself who had a career? Respect? Accomplishments? I can't even hold down a job bagging groceries. Something to do with my smile. Ugh.

I feel like I've been left behind. All the women around me are so . . .not like me. They take Pilates. They arrange playdates. They don't care about dinosaurs.

This project was actually the second project. I started buying a used (incredibly filthy)  Gaggia Carezza Deluxe, after cleaning it all, is didn't get to temp and it was leaking from somewhere. So I thought, I'd buy a very nice brushed aluminum Ascaso Dream UP which I knew was not warming up, not keeping pressure etc. but easy to work on.

Both of these machines were lacking minor parts that are hard to get and hard to fix, this is how they ended up after four weeks of fiddling and drinking extremely poor coffee:

Not impressive and not working. The Ascaso will initially be fixed, I love the looks of that machine, but I just needed a good morning shot, after weeks of poor coffee I was becoming depressed.

So this is what I did, I started looking around and thinking about what I need/want. I live alone, drink a double lungo every morning and once a week perhaps a cappuccino, so no need for a rotary pump dual boiler whatever setup. First my eye fell on a MiiCoffee Apex V2, but lacking history and an exposed circuit board didnt make it. Next I wanted a Lelit Anna PID. So I went to a big seller and specialist in the Netherlands and asked them about it, they came with another option, being the importer for Quick Mill.

Long story short: Tomorrow I will have good coffee, I got a brand new Quick Mill 3000 that is modded with a configurable OPV from the importer, so with warranty  safe :-).

I leapt to one side, miraculously keeping the coffee from spilling. He charged straight toward the exit. Damn it, drama like this kept happening whenever my receptionist wasn‚Äôt around to help.

I swiftly placed the coffee on the nearest surface and ran after him.

‚ÄúJulius!‚Äù (\*Not his real name).

He was emanating rage so tangible, I could almost see it smoking off his back.

He yanked the clinic door open and sprinted off.

I gave chase to the lift, but the lift door closed in my face.

I contemplated running down the stairs, but doubted I could reach him in time.

So I returned to the clinic, hurried towards my office. I needed to call his emergency contact, to try to keep him safe.

I opened the door, and came to an abrupt stop.

Julius was still seated in my office. He seemed calm, collected, with no trace of the rage he was emanating just a few moments before.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶what?‚Äù I stared blankly at Julius, then at the exit I just saw him leave from.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve a twin?‚Äù I was grasping at straws. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone else enter my office. But then again, a twin could have snuck in while I was making the coffee.

‚ÄúNo, that was‚Ä¶‚Äù Julius hesitated. Then he sighed.

‚ÄúI think you should take a seat,‚Äù he said.

Was I in a movie? Weren‚Äôt those words typically said by the police or doctors to people before they delivered bad news?

I took a seat anyway.

‚ÄúRemember when we were talking about parts?‚Äù

I nodded. We had been discussing the different parts that each of us have, different parts of our minds that form who we are. There are protective parts, angry parts, insecure parts, and so on.

‚ÄúWell, I talked about how I had an angry, aggressive part, who would sometimes take over, and whenever that part of me took over, I would lose control,‚Äù he continued.

I nodded again. ‚ÄúAnd we talked about you having a conversation with that part of you, to better understand that part‚Äôs role, beliefs, and so on,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, while you were making coffee, I talked to it. Told that angry part of myself that it had to go.‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. The goal of our therapy sessions wasn‚Äôt to get rid of any parts. It was to get to understand each part‚Äôs perspectives and experiences, to eventually integrate them. I was tempted to mention that, but that was not the issue at hand.

‚ÄúWait, okay, and?‚Äù I asked. I had a feeling I knew Julius‚Äôs answer.

‚ÄúAnd so he left. That was him, that stormed out.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶a part of you just‚Ä¶took shape. Took on a physical form and stormed out. Is that what you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù

Julius nodded and my heart sank. He was either hallucinating, deluded, playing a prank on me, or maybe I was hallucinating.

Maybe we both were hallucinating. I did see a Julius storm out, while this Julius sat right here in my office.

‚ÄúHey Julius, I know it‚Äôs still April, but if this is some April‚Äôs fool prank, I must say-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù Julius cut in curtly. ‚ÄúWhen you talked about parts, I thought you understood.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood what?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy condition. My situation. That I have different parts of myself, and that they have their own lives and bodies.‚Äù

I bit my lip. I considered pressing the emergency button. I stared him dead in his eyes and saw the shining conviction in them. Cold sweat prickled at my neck.

‚ÄúParts therapy is just a form of therapy. It‚Äôs just a therapy that takes into account the multi-faceted nature of our mind. It addresses the many sides to our personality and self. I‚Ä¶I definitely did not mean actual separate people.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut in my case, that‚Äôs just what it is.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf what you‚Äôre saying is true‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is true!‚Äù Julius let out a frustrated sigh. ‚ÄúWatch this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Mopey,‚Äù he said. Mopey was his nickname for the sad, depressive part of himself. ‚ÄúMopey, get out of my body now. Please. Just show her. She‚Äôs got to know you exist. Please, you have to make her believe me.‚Äù

Nothing happened. I smiled gently, trying to wipe any trace of awkwardness from the situation.

‚ÄúHey, Julius? It‚Äôs okay. Everything's -‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, he‚Äôs coming out,‚Äù Julius snapped.

I stifled a sigh. Then blinked. And rubbed my eyes. Blinked again.

Julius was splitting into two. Right in front of my eyes. For a heartstopping moment, he resembled a pair of siamese twins, with two heads, four arms stuck to one lower half. Nausea roiled in my stomach. Then a pair of legs stepped out from the existing pair of legs.

‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK?‚Äù I yelled. My first swear word in front of this client. Or rather, these clients. I stared at the two men staring back at me.

The Julius that had stepped out from the other Julius looked exactly like him. But his shoulders were hunched, facial features pulled down in a look of abject misery, and he stood as if about to collapse from exhaustion.

‚ÄúAll right come back in,‚Äù Julius 1 said to Julius 2. Julius 2 paused for a long moment, looking down at the ground. Then, before my horrified fascination, he slowly lifted one foot, then the other, and trudged back into Julius 1.

I slumped back in my seat. ‚ÄúHoly‚Ä¶son of a mother. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived like that all my life. I‚Äôve different parts of me. Sometimes they take over what I call my main body, and I‚Äôm out of control. Other times, they simply step right out and do whatever the hell they want.‚Äù Julius breathed out a long sigh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a relief finally telling someone about this. You have no idea the crazy shit, the lengths I‚Äôve had to go to to hide their existence. ExistenCES,‚Äù he corrected himself.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶uh huh‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, my brain trying to make sense of it all. I wanted to run. To slap myself awake. I tried to rationalise what just happened. I couldn‚Äôt find any explanation.

Enough had happened in my life for me to know that the world wasn‚Äôt always as it seemed. Stranger things have happened in life.

‚ÄúSo, you have parts that can leave your body. And walk away. In physical forms. How does that even work? I mean, matter isn‚Äôt lost or created, right? How did you get enough flesh to form another body, and‚Ä¶does your brain multiply too? I-‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no idea. Never tried to find out. Don‚Äôt want to end up in a lab.‚Äù Julius‚Äôs brows knitted, and a sly, cruel smirk seized his mouth. ‚ÄúAnd if you ever try to tell anyone, I‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù

My eyes widened. I stood up, ready to run.

Julius‚Äôs face softened. ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean that. That was Darius.‚Äù Darius was the name Julius gave to what he called his ‚Äúmurderous part‚Äù.

It was similar to his angry part in that both were based on rage. But while his angry part liked to yell and throw tantrums, Darius, on the other hand, was cool-headed. He liked to take his time creating meticulous, intricate plans involving murdering those who displeased him.

It was one thing being told such things when you assumed someone was talking about a part of themselves, a dark side of their personality. It‚Äôs another when you realise they‚Äôre talking about an actual being that could step right out of them and rip your throat out.

‚ÄúUhm, tell Darius that well, I uhm, I won‚Äôt tell anyone about this‚Ä¶this condition. But if he keeps threatening me, well, then confidentiality is moot, and-‚Äù

Julius snarled, and a head leapt out of his head. For a stomach-turning moment, he had two heads. One with a cold, twisted smile, and another that was contorted in fear.

The fearful looking face shut its eyes, and grit its teeth. Then the second head got sucked back in, and they merged with an uncomfortably wet plop.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôll try to keep him under control,‚Äù Julius said.

I choked down the nausea that arose.

I should have quit. I should have quit for good. Never should have come back. I should have just travelled the world, doing odd jobs or something to survive. Why the hell did I come back to be a psychologist?

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hurt her,‚Äù Julius hissed. I assumed he was talking to Darius.

I shut my eyes, and let resignation wash over me. Then I opened my eyes, and calmly sat down again.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù I said. I had reached my breaking point. Just like the past times when I had reached this point, something in me just shut down. The fear morphed into a heavy resignation. My shoulders slumped.

‚ÄúSo, now we got to get the angry you back, right?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHave they ever escaped like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve never told them to leave. But they have come out at inopportune times. Usually they know better than to come out with witnesses around. And they definitely have never appeared in front of more than one person, much less charged out into the streets.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶others have witnessed this before‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. But they tend to think that they‚Äôre losing it. You know? Especially since no one else was around, and I insisted nothing had happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. Uh huh. Okay. Well. Welp. Okay.‚Äù I just sat there, mind grinding to a halt.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get Darren back,‚Äù Julius said. Darren was the name he gave to his angry part.

What‚Äôs this ‚Äúwe‚Äù business, was what I wanted to say. But instead, I went, ‚ÄúYes. We‚Äôve got to get him back. Then work on integrating these different parts of you, not getting rid of any of them, so that you can, well, you know, not‚Ä¶have people jumping out of you.‚Äù

Julius frowned. ‚ÄúI came here to get rid of them. I don‚Äôt want to be sad. Or angry. Or murderous. Or insecure. I want to just be happy. At peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I said, all my psychologist decorum gone. ‚ÄúNot possible. Not healthy. Not a single soul on Earth can claim to only ever be happy and at peace. Nope. Emotions are important. Each part of us serves a purpose. Exists for a reason. Blah, blah. The healthy thing to do is to help all parts live together in harmony, integrating into an adaptive whole.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you want the murderous part of me staying in my personality?‚Äù Julius asked.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary, but many people have murderous parts. Our other parts usually help keep them in check.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Julius looked like he was about to argue. Then his eyes lit up. ‚ÄúI know where Darren will be!‚Äù He pulled out his phone, and began typing feverishly. ‚ÄúHe likes to go to this rage room when he‚Äôs angry. He likes to smash things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶if you go there, what‚Äôs people gonna say about there being two of you?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwins, of course. Like you said.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd triplets, if another of you emerges?‚Äù

Julius grinned. I frowned. He seemed to be enjoying this just a little too much.

‚ÄúPlease help me get him back,‚Äù he added, looking pleadingly at me. I considered terminating our therapy on the spot, and going home to take a nice long bath.

Then I sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm charging by the hour.‚Äù

A very long story short, after a lot of bargaining, pleading, tears and whatnot, Julius got Darren back.

I honestly thought that I had a chance at having normal therapy sessions with Julius after that. That I could just ignore the fact that his parts could take on physical bodies.

By the next day, I knew I was wrong.

Julius showed up at my office, though he was booked in for next week.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù was the first thing he said.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked, dread pooling in my gut.

‚ÄúDarius.‚Äù

Of course. Of course the one to escape and go MIA would be the worst possible one to do so. The murderous one.

‚ÄúDo you know why?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said he needed to be free. That he didn‚Äôt want to be integrated. He wanted to stay his own person. He didn‚Äôt want to be tethered to me anymore.‚Äù Julius shut his eyes. ‚ÄúI think he wants to kill people.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why didn‚Äôt he start with you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNot being cruel, just curious.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs afraid that if I‚Äôm gone, he will be too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù

We were silent for a while. ‚ÄúAny idea who he‚Äôll go after first?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou.‚Äù

Of course. Of, fucking, course.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even do shit to him,‚Äù I protested anyway. I didn‚Äôt care if I was being unprofessional. This situation was way out of my depth. ‚ÄúCan I just terminate our therapy and be done with him too?‚Äù

I know, I know. I wasn‚Äôt being kind. But I‚Äôve been through a lot in my life. Too much, for me to want to put up with more of this stuff.

Julius smiled sadly. ‚ÄúI wish it were that easy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine at the way he said that. ‚ÄúYou know something about his plans?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has many. I‚Äôve seen his mind. He has mapped out 47 possible ways of killing you. And about as many for all the different people he‚Äôs thought about killing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMurdering,‚Äù I corrected.

‚ÄúMurdering,‚Äù Julius agreed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the police,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAnd saying what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off. What the hell could I say? If I mentioned Julius at all, this Julius would be locked up. The murderous one would still be free.

And how was I going to explain any of this stuff to the police?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going overseas,‚Äù I said, with a firm nod.

Julius‚Äôs eyes lit up. ‚ÄúThat would work! I have our‚Ä¶my passport. He has none. He can‚Äôt leave the country.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh!‚Äù My heart lifted. For the first time, there was a very simple solution to my problems. And it was an attractive solution. I got to go on vacation, while avoiding a murdering asshole.

‚ÄúWhat country does he hate?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúJust in case.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, anywhere without fancy hotels, I guess. I know his preferences.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh. Okay see you. I‚Äôm booking a flight to‚Ä¶wait I‚Äôm not gonna tell you. Just in case, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Julius said. He paused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I roped you into this. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶I‚Äôll try to get him back. So you can come home.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sure,‚Äù I said, distractedly. I was already booking my first flight. I would take a few connecting flights, just to make sure it was harder to be tracked. Who knew, maybe that Julius would steal the passport. Oh shit.

‚ÄúHey, do me a favour, get back home right now. Grab your passport, lock it somewhere Darius wouldn‚Äôt be able to access. Okay?‚Äù

Anxiety filled Julius‚Äôs face as he realised what I was worried about. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, and turned to leave. ‚ÄúGoodbye, and sorry,‚Äù he said again, at the door.

‚ÄúNot your fault. Not really,‚Äù I said.

Well, all that happened 2 months ago. For two months, I was basking in nature, far, far away from my country.

But I just flew home yesterday. Julius had texted, told me he had found Darius, convinced him to rejoin him in the same body.

I could finally come home, but well, I didn‚Äôt really look forward to it. It was fun, vacationing indefinitely.

But I needed to work, and my clients were waiting.

I‚Äôve just unpacked and loaded up the laundry, and already I‚Äôm thinking about future therapy sessions with Julius.

Okay, there‚Äôs the doorbell. I think my pizza‚Äôs here.

Okay shit. First of all, shit.

It wasn‚Äôt pizza. It was Julius. He said he wanted to check on me, see how I am. That he had an important thing to share with me, that it couldn‚Äôt wait for office hours.

But I never told Julius my home address. How the hell did he find me?

And he seemed‚Ä¶off. Like he had plastered on a hollow smile that could fall off any moment.

I didn‚Äôt open the door, of course. But he‚Äôs still there. He‚Äôs not calling out my name anymore, but when I checked the peephole 5 minutes ago, he was still outside, smiling emptily.

I‚Äôm creeped out. Maybe I should call the cops.

I‚Äôll give it 10 more minutes. If he doesn‚Äôt leave, I‚Äôll call the cops.

Okay what the hell just happened? The pizza guy came, the actual pizza guy. I couldn‚Äôt open the door. Julius was still outside. But I needed to tip the delivery guy, get my pizza. I yelled at him to leave it at the door. Julius took the pizza from him, and said something to him that I couldn‚Äôt make out through the peephole.

The pizza guy reared his head back, as if attacked, then turned and walked rapidly away. Whatever Julius said had really freaked him out.

‚ÄúHey, this is unacceptable,‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Julius said, in a cold, cocky tone. ‚ÄúDo that. You‚Äôll see what happens to Kayla. And Julie. And your parents.‚Äù (All fake names, I need to protect them)

He then proceeded to read out their addresses.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he added after, ‚ÄúI think Kayla‚Äôs about to head out to walk Puffy‚Äù.

My breath caught in my throat. Was he monitoring them? Did he have surveillance cameras? I pulled up Kayla‚Äôs contact, ready to call her.

‚ÄúWarn them, and they die,‚Äù Julius announced cheerfully.

It was like he could read my mind.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Every cell in my body tingled. I felt an irrational urge to fling the door open and strangle that smirk off his face. I wanted to call the police. But I couldn‚Äôt be sure Julius couldn‚Äôt get to my best friends, to my parents, before help arrived. What if‚Ä¶what if his other parts were out? Working for him?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not opening the door,‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúIf you say so,‚Äù Julius mocked in an oily, knowing tone.

I strode to my bedroom and slammed the door shut.

I need to warn them, that‚Äôs for sure. How could I do so, warn my friends and parents, without him knowing? How was he keeping track of them?

I should have made up emergency code words or signals with them. I had thought about that, after watching one too many horror movies, but hadn‚Äôt actually gotten around to that.

I saw the text from my receptionist then.

‚ÄúHey, I gave the police your number, they will be calling you soon. I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs bad news. Your client, Julius, was found dead in his home. And his entire family was dead. They think he might have pulled a murder suicide.‚Äù

I felt the blood drain from my face. My legs gave way and I collapsed to the ground. I stayed there, like a puddle of bones and flesh, for a long time.

Julius was dead. His entire family was dead. Then this was‚Ä¶this was Darius. I had suspected that, but‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt expect him to really kill off Julius. And the entire family.

My stomach twisted painfully, and all I could hear was the sound of my heart thudding away.

Julius. I hadn‚Äôt helped him. I had fled overseas, left him to deal with his murderous part, all on his own. Now he was dead.

Fuck. I had caused his death. His family‚Äôs death. Indirectly, but still. His blood was on my hands too.

I took in a few deep, slow breaths to calm my hammering heart. Then I crafted a message to my best friends and my parents.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in extreme danger from an unstable, dangerous client. You are too. He threatened to kill you. He‚Äôs monitoring you right now. In real time. I‚Äôm calling the police soon. But he will try to go after you. He may send others after you. The moment you see this message, get yourself somewhere safe. Call the police. Get all the help you can.  I love you. I‚Äôll deal with this, and I‚Äôll explain more when this is all over. Stay safe.‚Äù

I hesitated. I wasn‚Äôt ready to send it out.

I grabbed the kitchen knife, wrapped duct tape around the handle, and tried the grip. The duct tape provided better resistance. I read somewhere that many people got cut when they tried to stab others, because their hands slipped. The duct tape surface ought to help with that.

I locked my bedroom door, went into the bathroom, and locked that door too.

Then I sat down to complete this post. Because well, if I die, I want everyone to know what happened to me. The real story.

I picked up the phone to dial the cops, and Darius hollered from the doorway. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it! Once you do, you‚Äôre done. I will kill you, and everyone you love.‚Äù

I thought for a moment that my neighbours may come to my rescue. He was loud. But then I remembered - they are overseas.

Okay. I just sent out the message. I‚Äôm calling the cops now.

I don‚Äôt care much about looks but more of how I feel. I have gained weight (120 lbs up to 150lbs!) 
For months I have felt down, heavy, slow, lethargic. 
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, female, and 150 lbs but still wear a size 2 and small sizes but have NO freaking energy. 
I‚Äôm 41. 
I walk about 20k steps a day, get some hikes in when it‚Äôs nice out during the week and light weights so I‚Äôm moderately active.  

Due to work I already only eat twice a day, once at 4:00pm and again around 10;30pm. Just the way my work schedule is. Bc I work the late shift 3pm-11pm or later.  

I‚Äôve always wanted to try a water fast, but worry about losing muscle mass and looking flabby.  Would 17 days of strict water fast be a concern for loose skin?   

My timeline is 17 days because it‚Äôs how much time I have between semesters and I also have a break from work (seasonal it‚Äôs closed) so I have some actual time to devote to this mentally. 

Or is a protein sparing modified fast more ideal?  (Eating 800 calories a day from protein lean sources, electrolytes, minimal veggies but maybe add in some cucumbers/ spinach). 

In the past when tried keto or vegan raw diet I lost almost too much weight so fast I stopped. 
But honestly my energy sky rocketed!  Especially vegan. Lately in winter I got out of good eating habits with working so much, in school full time and busy mom. So my meals at work were not the healthiest, and I feel my body being so so tired. 
I also have PCOS and want to learn more about insulin resistance and do a really solid reset 

So what do you think. 

Maybe water fast and then switch into a PSMF with refeeds?

Also does tea and coffee break the fast? 

I worry about having no protein I guess. But now have the time to experiment and want to do it wisely. 
I have the discipline for whatever, my mind is ready for that makes sense.
