Felt like a throbbing rock in my side only if compressed - I. E. Sitting or bending over for long periods. Standing up or laying down annd stretching always helped. Never really seemed related to fat/food. In Jan I got endoscopy, ultrasound and HIDA scan (using Ensure milkshake to trigger  gallbladder contraction) - my EF was 11% and imaging / blood work were all fine. 

Fast forward to May, pain still uncomfortable / concerning. Redo imaging, all good. See GI specialist #2 and redo HIDA - EF is 2.5-%. This time they gave me CCK hormone and it produced intense contractions. After getting this, it felt like my gallbladder completely gave up. I’d be bloated as a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day ballon after eating anything - fat or not. My PCP referred me to a surgeon and gave me anti-spasmodic, quick stomach emptying meds, GasX and Famatodine to manage symptoms until my surgery happened today. 

Had surgery today. Cleaned my self with their special soap, dressed in gown, they put in IV and gave me anti-nausea meds (I was VERY stressed and anxious), hydrated me and gave me something that made me feel really drunk (sedative). Rolled me back, saw the OR lights and room, gave me anesthesia and I knocked out. Woke up back in prep room, very loopy. They showed me my gallbladder (can’t remember). Said it was all fine, no stones identified. Will go to pathology. 

I’m 10 hours post-op now and feel fine other than sore abdomen - can’t do pushups/getting in and out of bed is annoying. Slightly sore throat. Very sleepy. Pressure. I haven’t had to take any pain meds at all, so pain is very manageable. I just feel loopy when I try to walk. I’ll update again in a few days in case things change. But overall waiting to see when I can eat normal again… normal for me is not bad at all. 


Had couple bites of subway, realized shouldn’t eat that. Had applesauce, bone broth and toast with jelly. Some coffee. 

Hope this might help someone feel less anxious. Good luck to everyone!

1mwv4pj,https://i.redd.it/7b7b9uwxihkf1.png,Hello r/ChanceAI — we turned your camera into a Curiosity Lens. Ask us anything.,"Restore the kind of curiosity humans were born with — the urge to stop, look, and wonder. We believe seeing should be the start of a journey, not the end of a scroll. Chance AI exists to turn sight into insight and everyday moments into lasting stories. Hi everyone — we’re the **Chance AI** team. Quick intro + why we’re here.

• **Why this matters:** mainstream visual search often returns shopping links or vague guesses. We’re focused on cultural and design stories — the kind of context that turns a glance into curiosity.

• **What we build:** Chance AI is a Curiosity Lens that doesn’t just label pixels — it decodes context, history, and design meaning from anything you snap. We want people to *see to search*, not type to find.

• **How we design experiences:** one click — point, snap, learn. We intentionally removed the prompt box because users shouldn’t need to learn “prompt grammar” to explore. The result: faster, more intuitive discovery.

• **Who we are:** a small team of product, visual-algorithm, and design veterans (former OnePlus, OPPO, ByteDance, Royal College of Art collaborators) building this from New York to the world. We combine product-scale experience with art & design sensibility.

• **Want to try & help shape it?** we’re running a closed beta and inviting curious travelers, designers, museum-goers, and everyday explorers. Beta perks include free premium, early access to features, and direct support from our team. Say “beta” below and we’ll DM details / sign-up.

**How you can help right now:**

1. Post one photo (street art, a shop sign, a coffee label, a souvenir) and tell us: *what you expected vs what you hoped to learn*. We’ll reply with what Chance AI surfaces and explain how we got that result.
2. Tell us bluntly: what frustrates you about visual search today? (No filter — we want real feedback.)
3. If you want a beta invite, comment “beta” and we’ll DM next steps.

We’ll post weekly “Snap & Share” highlights, share product updates, and run AMAs with the team. Excited to meet curious minds here.

1mwv4ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mwv4ld/is_this_enough_to_stop_a_potential_relationship/,Is this enough to stop a potential relationship,"Hello everyone! 

For some backstory, I (F24) have been talking to/dating this guy (M24) for about 4 1/2 months now. We are not dating as in being in a relationship, but we have been on countless dates and he recently lived with me short term before he moved out of our state. He is very sweet to me and I have no doubt his positive feelings towards me are genuine, despite his potential pre mature “I love you”. 
He told me he loved me around 2 months ago. He has wanted to be in an exclusive relationship for awhile now, but I have some hesitations.

I often end up being the emotional support for the people I love and he is no exception. I consistently go out of my way to be there for him in whichever ways I can, beyond just emotionally. He is successful for our age and does have a good head on his shoulders. He treats me well and does go out of the way on occasion to go above the norm for certain things. 

To get to the main issue- we are at a point where I am unsure if it is best to begin a full on relationship. I do not receive the same emotional support I provide for him and I have kindly expressed that over the course of our situation. And we would now be long distance. I know no one can make the decision for me, but I am more so curious about this specific situation that has now come up. 

He was in a toxic relationship that began 2 years ago and ended a little over a year ago. He isn’t the type to shit talk an ex for no reason, but I know that she was the main point of toxicity. We have mutual friends who experienced it first hand and wanted him out of the relationship. May not mean much but she is also 7 years older than us but owned a bar on his college campus. 

He is back in his college town for a work event, and he told me that she texted him asking to meet up to apologize. I am not one to be controlling and I always lead with understanding. But he verbatim said “it’s not like I want an apology, I just want us to be cool if I see her” “I don’t want to be scared if I run into her at cvs”. I completely understand wanting no bad blood, but he is unlikely to return to this city again  after this event. To me, it would make more sense if he actually wanted an apology or closure but he wants to “be cool”. We are close enough that he would be able to express if he needed those things. He let me know he has a plan about meeting at a coffee shop, instead of just having her run by the venue during sound check. 

The reason I feel uneasy is because we are going on a trip immediately after he leaves that city, for the purpose of me figuring out where we stand. In a way it seems like he wants to see her just to see her. Which I understand and don’t fault him for. But I take relationships incredibly seriously and would be lying if I said I wouldn’t want to be with someone who was interested in opening up the past without a clear reason. He knows I won’t be upset, but he knows I’m uneasy and has gone ahead with planning it. 

I am just genuinely curious to hear your thoughts and opinions on the situation. I know we’re young and the ex thing is not a huge deal. Trust me I get that. But beginning a relationship is a big deal to me, for both of our sakes. I know this was unnecessarily long I just wanted to give details. Hoping I don’t come off crazy I’m just a little lost overall and this situation doesn’t help. Feeling like my intuition is telling at me a bit, but I want it to work. 

TRDL; issues have arisen before even dating but willing to work though. Right before our trip to figure out if I want to begin a relationship, he wants to see his ex with lack of reason (when there could be a solid reason to do so).

Living with an elderly mother, no she's not demented or suffering with a mental disorder because of it. Just making that clear. She just needs someone for the physical things she cannot do any longer.

I haven't had a proper vacation or time off in nearly ten years. No family members want to lend a hand. They never cared enough. It's depressing knowing that I am the only one who cared enough to stay and help my mom when my dad left her for another woman in 2003. 

I have anger management issues, dealing with that on the side. Mom doesn't make it easy.

All I want is a week or two of peace, no more dealing with her. She drives me batty. 

The house is always a mess. Has been since I was a kid and nothing has changed. I have made great attempts to clean out clutterd areas. Spent days on end cleaning the kitchen. All she had to do was maintain, did she? No.

I hate the clutter with a passion but feel hopeless because it always goes back to square one. Just once I would love to see something I cleaned up remain that way without me having to do 100% of the effort.

I have tried approaching her kindly, offering to clean it myself if she would just maintain it. But no.

I've given up. I feel used and hopeless. I am tired of this situation and I honestly want out. I can't afford to live solo and neither can she. So I am trapped. 

All I dream about is being lost and never finding home. 

I don't want to blow up on her but the frustration hit a high note when my cat had puked on my bed and I had no clean sheets because when she does laundry, apparently sheets don't count. Yes I usually wash them myself.

I tripped over a pile of junk and that was it. I started piling all the junk into a space and told her she either finds a proper place for it or it goes out. If at the end of this month it remains I will have a crew come clean it up. 

Atop it all, as I went through grabbing all the stuff off the coffee table, the hearing aids I bought her were just out in the open for the cats or dog to get at. Now they're not the professional 4k version, but the best I could find. 

Zero care. A little a day and the problem goes away. Hording is the obvious answer to why.

I am crying out of frustration right now and trying to stay away from her so I don't yell any more. I have no out. ",1,1755831214.0,rant,0,1.0,False

I work in a small business bakery and my boss and coworkers are sorta friends.
But lately they’ve became kind of mean girls, and isolated me, which has happened all throughout my life with various friend groups and i just don’t know what i’m doing wrong.
I’m nice as i can be.
One particular day before i was going on vacation i got my nails done and was so excited about them.
When I showed my boss, Jaylah, (fake name)
She said ew and they were too long.
(they were a simple almond shape)
And then she kept hounding on me.
A lady dropped her coffee while trying to get out of the door and i got yelled at in front of the customer, which is fine, i get being upset at me, but this particular day it was so back to back, constant criticism, and not in a kind way.
And in my defense, the lady didn’t seem to be struggling.
Then she told be to fold boxes, so i did, then i got yelled at for.. not doing other things?
 Then yelled at for not folding boxes again.
So i’m freaking out, anxiety through the roof, scrambling trying to please Jaylah.
Then i’m yelled at for pacing.
My coworkers always huddle together, talking,  not working and never get yelled at.Literally all shift long my coworker Emily is eating, joking around with Jaylah, and the easy fun stuff.
I get talked over and ignored by them.
I get called slow and “lost” even though i do most of their jobs. (besides the fun stuff like making coffees, coming up with recipes and stuff because they want to do that)
Jaylah along with the rest of the staff  talks bad about all the employees behind their backs to other employees and customers and i’m sure she does it to me too so it makes me sad.
One of my coworkers made a joke about me being slow (stupid) to a regular right in front of me and they laughed in my face.
Sometimes i just wonder what’s wrong with me.

I'm Blythe, I've lived in West Sacramento and the greater Sacramento area for most of my life but moved for a few years before moving back and found basically all the friends I had here moved away at some point. I moved back a few years ago with a partner but we broke up a bit ago and I kind of stuck to myself for a bit. But now I'm trying to get out there!

I'm queer and wanting to find other queer people to become friends with! I also have DID, this is something I want to be upfront about as if we want to get to know each other that's something you'll learn about me fairly quickly. I am totally cool with answering questions about the disorder and people being curious so don't worry about any of that. I am very open about this in my personal life so it's something that is going to be obvious.

About me: I am hugely into outdoorsy stuff, I love going on walks and just like being outside. I used to like going out to lakes or hiking but I don't quite want to do that on my own so I haven't done it much. I like board and video games though because of work I haven't done too too much of either of those lately. I am big into World of Warcraft because I've played since Vanilla but I'm not hardcore into it or anything.

I love going places, like just walking around downtown or going out to get coffee somewhere and just chatting. I love talking about anything and everything, it's probably want I like to do the most in general. If you want to talk about it, chances are so do I. I like being there to be a listening ear or just a supportive friend, I believe in community and doing what I can for others in general.

I could honestly type forever so what I'll say is, if I sound like a potential friend then DM me! Any little blurb or information or request to get to know each other. Thanks for reading!",1,1755830894.0,SacramentoFriends,1,1.0,False

This Can’t Be Real… But It 100% Was!,"Has anyone ever just stumbled into something SO bizarrely easy that you almost feel like you’re in a fever-dream?

Because…what actually just happened to me?

Like, I made **$100 in ONE week** using nothing but my phone, and my main requirement was tapping through some random apps on my couch while watching The Office reruns.

I was fully prepared for one of those sketchy surveys that pay you seven cents for every six days of effort.

But (plot twist!) this was actually legit.

Here’s literally what went down, because I’m still TECHNICALLY confused and also wildly hyped:

---

### 🤑 Step 1: My Hyper-Skeptical Scroll

- Saw a thread about getting paid to ""test new apps.""
- Eye-rolled SO HARD, but the curiosity (and let’s be honest, desperation for coffee money) won.
- Clicked on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, expecting a scam alert to go off.

---

### 🤔 Step 2: Spoiler—No Scams Yet?

- Page looked…okay? (No angry pop-ups, no “Give us your SSN” crap. BIG RELIEF.)
- Registered using just my email. (No weird info demanded.)
- Got a list of apps to download and specific actions to take on each.

---

### 😳 Step 3: Wait, That Was It?!

- Downloaded some new games, one finance tracker (ignored the budgeting advice, sorry!).
- Did a few daily tasks like logging in, completing simple tutorials, or using them for 2-3 minutes.
- Each app had crystal clear instructions, like ""Open the app & play level 2, then screenshot the result.”

Kept checking my progress on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** to make sure things were tracking. It updated almost immediately after task completion.

---

### 💸 Step 4: Real, Spendable Money (NOT Monopoly Bucks?!)

- Earnings summary actually went up fast. Downloading the highest paying apps? BOOM, $5 here, $8 there.
- After five days, I had $73 just from staring at my phone while waiting for my pasta to boil. 😵
- End of the week? A grand total of $100, plus a few cents and a pile of digital confetti in my head.

Requested payout on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**…and yes, got paid. Into my PayPal, no extra hoops.

---

### 👉 **Would I recommend it?**

Let me be blunt: I’ve tried a lot of “side hustle” stuff before and usually ended up with fifty cents and a headache.
But this was fast, almost brainless, and honestly harder to believe than my car’s extended warranty calls.

If you’re bored, have a phone, and want to test if your disbelief is stronger than your bank balance, try **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

\-Organize study groups or coffee hangouts

\-Share events, tips, or just talk about life at UBCO



It’s open to everyone — new students, upper years, grad students, etc. No pressure, just a chill space to connect.

Here’s the link if you want to join: [https://discord.gg/sxtuHEvF](https://discord.gg/sxtuHEvF)

1mwuvmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cebuBPORelationship/comments/1mwuvmr/giving_hints_you_like_them_to_someone_who_is_on_a/,Giving hints you like them to someone who is on a relationship.,"1 month in a new bpo company and she is our trainer. Smart, cutie , very friendly and just someone na you feel comfortable to be with. 

Lord , ganahan kay ko magtan aw niya, she cute and the way she talks ba like nindot tutukan iya mata. I know she is in a relationship , but I am the type of person na if I like you ganahan ko makahibaw ka. If I like you not in a romantic way , like makadirect ra jud ko ug ingon sa imo. But if I like you , na in a way na i think of you na pwede uyabon , mashy ko to tell you but I'll give hints. I joke and tease ginagmay and all, i do eye contact and magtutuk ko nimu na ganahan ko makabaw ka na nagtan-aw ko nimu and I want to see how you react. 

So yeah , during the training class set up via Zoom. Mag joke around , if maabot namu duha ang sungog like mo baws sad jud ko ginagmay giving her hints , na I like her jud. Usahay , I tease her around na mag coffee me sometimes, or like e add sa second account dili lang sa main. Pina joke , but I really want to see how she reacts ing-ana na joke if ganahan ba siya mo padayon ko ing-ana na approach. Mo tan-do2 ra sad siya, and then say ""sige sige"" but I never did really. Adto ra to taman. 

Duting training if naa chance na moduol siya sa akoa station, and guide me sa akong call. I'll make sure na mo tan-aw jud ko niya eye to eye ! Hahahha para shell feel na i like her gyud, looking at her reactions ,smile raman siya , delulu lang gyud siguro ko and I feel like this is how she is with everyone pud or me lng . Im confuse man kay I  dont want to feed my delulu thoughts and if everytime magtudlo siya nako, she'll lean closer to me duol sa akong nawng and I'll at her. ,straight to eyes and pretend to listen I really just want to see her reaction at that moment .Girl, she smilling , delulu ko or not and then she touched my cheeks usahay if mag-explain na siya ana na time and confuse2 akong face kuno and then tells me ""cute gyud oi"" hahahahahah and then one time she compliments me I have pretty eyes daw during this ing-ani na time. This scene happend mga butang natog more than 3 times. 5 or less ana . Wala nay labot ng magtambay siya duol sa akong station during call training floorwalk , thats just me being delulu basin ganahan ra jud siya didto na side kay talkative akong tapad. Idk. Do i try not to think about mga little things ana. Hahah 


So positive man akong mga little hints. Try droppinh DMs sa workteams. Asking her if ""asa na siya ? Why wala pa siya nabalik sa Zoom meeting namu!"" Like mga ing-ana na question na letting her know na nangita ko niya. Of like if mag off siya cam sa Zoom. I'll tell her , ""Pag On camera Miss , di ko kita nimu"" mga ing-ana ra jud .

She loves reading book, I have a lot of books. I used to read a lot , so one time I told her. I'll give you one puhon. And then I did.  So didto na book. Naa sentence didto na 'You should write your goal in a piece of paper , para everyday nimu makit-an' para naa kay clear sight sa imong goal, and that one way to manifest it. What I did ? Gibutang nako iya name sa paper . Gi insert nako didto na page and highlighted using a highlighter that phrase . To give hint that ""she is my goal"" and I like her. 
> wala pa ko ask if kita ba siya ato na note or kahibaw ba siya ako buot pasabot ? 3 days ago paman gud to nako gihatag hahahahah. Well be asking her again siguro after 1 month , if nabasa na ba niya to or not. Haha 


So , after that , delulu lang siguro everytime mo agi ko dapit sa iyang station wala manay paki sa mangagi but everytime mo agi nako run, mo lingi jud siya. Or maybe delulu lang jud ko. Hahahahaha anyways ,

Sa work Teams , thru DMs , so she was telling me she brought a book with her , pahulam daw unta niya nako pero na findout niya during our conversation ani na time dili mi same ug genre na ginabasa. So ana siya dili na lang , kay dili ra ko ma interesado. Dont get us wrong , conversation na moment is civil lang .. so yah ana ayaw dili na lang. So I told, ay sige lang ari na lang ""para naa koy rason e message ka"" hahahahahhahahahah but she replied ba. ""It will not interest you lagi."" So ako ,na broken heart ko dayon , that moment , so mo insist jud siya na dili na lang , and says it will not interest me bisan kabaw na siya na ganahan ra ko manghuwam para naa koy rason. So basin dili sad siguro siya interesado nako , in a way na i like her. Murag that was the sign I was looking for to stop na phising attention sa iya and like giving her hints. But at the end of the shift , gitawag jud ko niya and told me "" Nara oh , baga ra ba ni, humana nig basa 1 week ha ?"" So am like 🫣 nag butterflies in my stomach na sad imong auntie like , dont feed my delulu mind sad bi hahahahahha . 

Mao pa na siya . Need advise! Idk , should I stop giving her hints ? Please make her stop!! Dapat fucos lang gyud siya sa iyang uyab. Ganahan ra ko makahibaw siya na ganahan ko niya , dapat e reject niya akong subtle ways and feelings para madivert akong attention sa lain hahahaha . ",1,1755830519.0,cebuBPORelationship,0,1.0,False

To start, I'm 32yo and started drinking around 13yo. I decided to quit on July 15 2025, so it hasn't been too long but honestly i feel great already. I apologize in advance for the long post. 

I started dating my now wife in 2013. We were both a little more than a year out of high school and at that point I was partying every weekend as an excuse to drink along with adding a little ""extra"" to my coffee every morning all while only being 19. After a few months of dating I realized that she was who I needed in my life and I needed to do everything I could to make sure that she stayed, and she made it pretty clear that the drinking was a problem. We both have alcoholism in our family, but back then I still wasn't even worried about it. Right around my 21st birthday I decided that I would stop liquor and try to only drink craft beer. It was my way of ""stopping"" while still enjoying the social aspect of it and maintaining the ability to drink. That worked for me for a long time. Once we got married and went on our honeymoon I decided to try a mixed drink, and from there I started drinking more of them which ultimately led me back to straight whiskey. I still never ""lost control"" but the drinking was back. I was honestly very proud that I felt able to manage it. 

Flash forward to July this year. Still doing ok ""managing"". We just had our second child and so I was home for a while from work. One day driving home from dropping our oldest at daycare a song came on that changed my life forever. Right then and there in the truck I decided that I was done for good. I want to be able to tell my kids that I beat it completely and I don't just ""manage it"". I want to be the best role model I can. 

For anyone wondering, the song was ""My Cross"" by Jelly Roll. The main part of the song is ""my cross to carry, won't be yours to pick up"" and I want to live that to the fullest. I urge everyone who might need help to go listen to it. But most of all, don't be afraid to reach out. If your struggling, talk to someone, read someone's story or just find inspiration somewhere. Everyone has or needs their own reason to quit. This was mine and hopefully it will help at least one other person.",3,1755830469.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I didn’t feel unsafe at all - my only regret was that I didn’t bring my 4” trifold mattress to be more comfortable 🤣 I couldn’t have a fire because of a fire ban, and the site was further from my car than I expected, but it was still  great. 

As I was packing up today, I saw a GIANT moose walk by, not 10’ from me. I was in awe (and then backed up another 10’ because moose can be dangerous, but he was just passing by). I tried to run back to my site to grab my phone and get a pic but he was almost gone by the time I took a pic.

1mwurj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/1mwurj1/residual_dizziness_for_a_month_now/,Residual dizziness for a month now.,"Hi all. I’ve had diagnosed BPPV for about 8 years now. Had an MRI done when it first started and all was normal. I’ve seen a vestibular physio regularly throughout this time. Usually every few weeks but increasing when I’m not well. 

I started feeling off and waking up with some spinning at the beginning of July. I’ve kind of learned to live with these symptoms so thought nothing of it and just scheduled another appointment with my physio.

I normally don’t drink coffee but on one peculiar day in late July I had a small amount at work. Within an hour I felt like my whole vestibular system was on fire. Not necessarily spinning but like I was falling and off balance. Like my body couldn’t process movement properly. These symptoms stayed like that for 5 days. Even went to the ER bc I thought it was dying. They did blood work, chest x ray etc. but nothing came up. My family doctor who I’ve seen since then thinks there may have been something slopped into the coffee at work.

I’ve since seen my physio for treatment who has done the epeley manoeuvre and checked my eyes for nystagmus with the goggles. I always tend to have some small amount of nystagmus but at my first treatment I definitely had more. He seems to think my central nervous system is affected as well most likely bc of whatever was in the coffee or if I had some sort of super caffeine reaction. Second treatment we did liberation to try to unstick the crystals and it seemed to trigger it again and I’ve felt dizzy / off balance, brain fog for the last couple weeks. This has been going on for 4 weeks now.  I’m slowly feeling better but very slowly. Still having dizzy spells. 

I also will add I have cervogenic or whatever neck vertigo as well which also seems to be acting up. 

I have a referral out to an ENT who will hopefully do another MRI to be safe. 

Has anyone experienced something like this? Looking for some hope that this will subside soon. ",1,1755830192.0,BPPV,1,1.0,False

In the modern era, and ESPECIALLY on apps/online, coffee dates should be the standard.

Coffee dates are a low pressure, inexpensive way to meet in a public place and determine if you’re even compatible.

Some reality checks:
- I don’t actually know you.
- We have to establish compatibility
- It’s low pressure for both parties
- you can go on a second date with more expectations.
- the cost of the date does not correlate with the quality of the relationship 

Maybe I’m a cold hearted bitch. I’m not rolling out the red carpet for someone I don’t know, and If someone spent bands on me I’d think they were trying to pull one on me. So…coffee is low pressure filtration process.

This post is specifically about thoughts on the above-mentioned machine, as I've owned a La Pavoni Cellini Classic before, but not a lever machine, so attempting to get more info. I understand these machines are similar or the same as the La Pavoni Europiccola. It seems slightly odd to me that a 20yo machine would be still almost half the price as a new one (retail $AUD1000-1200 here) but that retail is for the Europiccola not Gaggia and I understand that maybe they don't make these Gaggia machines any more.

I want to start IF, and was wondering if there was a free app that people liked so I could use it as a guide. I am a teacher and a toddler mom whose body has aggressivley entered perimenopause this past year. I tend to be isolated a lot of the time due to my schedule/responsibilities/boyfriend's schedule. He's not home a lot, so I need a little more motivation than just my own brain if that makes sense. I only want to lose about 10-15 lbs, but also want to sleep better, eat better, feel better, be stronger for my little girl. I want her to be proud of me and I want to feel good about myself. It's not terrible, but it could be better. School is starting back up and I wake up at 5, leave by 6, get to work (hopefully by 8 lol), return anytime between 4-5:30 depending on traffic. I love black coffee but can't have any after noon because I have anxiety and it disrupts my sleep. I love tea, and have a good idea of simple things I can eat every day and some better choices I can make for when I decided to get food on the block.

1mwufa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualconlang/comments/1mwufa7/collaborative_project_indoshemic_a_universal/,Collaborative Project: Indoshemic - A Universal Auxlang Based on Actual Language Contact,"I'm starting a collaborative project for a universal auxiliary language with a twist. Instead of Esperanto's European bias, **Indoshemic** [in.do.ˈʃe.mik] is based on the four language families that gave us our most universal loanwords: algebra, chocolate, coffee, and tea/chai.

**The Name:**
*Indoshemic* blends *Indo-* (Indo-European) + *Shem-* (Semitic, from Hebrew שם ""name/renown"") + *-ic* suffix. It represents the historical bridge between these major language families in global vocabulary transmission.

**The Concept:**
These words exist in nearly every language because they followed major historical trade and cultural exchange routes. By using the source families (Semitic, Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European, Uto-Aztecan), we get a more genuinely representative auxlang.

**Current grammar mix:**
- **Semitic**: 3-consonant roots (k-t-b = ""write""), dual number
- **Sino-Tibetan**: 3-tone system, classifiers, SOV word order  
- **Indo-European**: 5-case system, familiar verbal morphology
- **Uto-Aztecan**: Person prefixes/suffixes, ejective consonants

**Base-8 Counting System:**
Uses 8 digits: *sifr* (0), *mel* (1), *wej* (2), *ʃam* (3), *ʔon* (4), *ʃelu* (5), *xes* (6), *sab* (7)
- *mel-sifr* = 10₈ = 8₁₀ (""one-zero"")
- *mel-sifr-sifr* = 100₈ = 64₁₀ (their ""hundred"")

**Sample sentences:**

*Katab-wan-es ʔalgabra ʃe-mel ndâr-ma-te.*
[ka.ˈtab.wan.es ʔal.ˈga.bra ʃe.mel ˈndaːr.ma.te]
katab-wan-es ʔalgabra ʃe-mel ndâr-ma-te
write-AGENT-PL algebra CL.FLAT-one see-PERF-3PL
""The writers studied one (book of) algebra.""

ni ʃaj kafē-el ti-slâm-kwe
1SG tea coffee-DAT 2SG-peace-FUT
""I (choose) tea; you will be at peace with coffee.""

**Why this approach works better:**
- Based on *actual* historical language contact, not European colonialism
- Incorporates features familiar to speakers of major world languages
- Reflects real patterns of how humans have shared concepts globally
- Name itself honors the biblical and geographic origins of linguistic diversity

**What I need help with:**
- Expanding triconsonantal root vocabulary
- Developing classifiers for different cultural contexts
- Creating writing system reflecting the mixed heritage
- Working out how this would actually function as an auxlang

**The Moneyline:**

* **KT Wiz (-149):** The favorites, per most books, but don’t expect them to hit a grand slam in your retirement account. Implied probability? \~59.6% — about the same chance your morning coffee will survive the commute.
* **Doosan Bears (+257):** The underdogs, priced like a last-minute Black Friday deal. A 28% chance to win? That’s *exactly* the odds your Uncle Bob gives himself of remembering your birthday.

**The Spread:**

* **Doosan +1.5 (-110):** The Bears get the love of a Goldilocks bear — not too hot, not too cold, just enough to cover 1.5 runs.

Is this normal for a Leo mother? My husband just ignores her, people tell me it’s because she’s a Leo …idk …I usually get along with them. 

I’m a Scorpio and it’s incredibly hard to watch the constant emotionally charged language, the pick me behavior, and the controlling nature she has…and before you say anything, yes, I can be controlling but I wouldn’t be disrespectful to my MIL and I never was until I had my daughter and she was very much overstepping boundaries and somehow thought her role and word would rule my child and my household, she was sadly mistaken. She fortunately has learned that I’m not going to be walked on …but whyyyy did it come to thatttt? We had a good relationship prior to getting pregnant and married to her son. 

A few examples of the crazy: 

Family gathering: tries to control who engages with my child, so much so as saying “hey don’t hand that to her, let such and such do it”…tried to dictate who can sit by who, I’m talking trying to control everyone’s movements and coming from someone who is controlling, I’m like WTH is happening here 🧐. 

Christmas: had us make a Christmas list for our kid, then told me I could pick which gifts to bring home and she was keeping some because she bought them …
never have I experienced someone dictating a gift.  

Had a grandma shower, didn’t invite her son or me lol. Then bragged about the items she received…she received a car seat and stroller before we did and then got upset she never got to use them. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
she called crying about her experience as a grandma being shattered by us not allowing 1:1 time. Mind you, we use to visit OFTEN. 

Love bombing: treats you poorly then wants to drop a coffee off randomly because she can tell you are upset and thinks the gesture will make it better? But, the poor behavior on her part, continues, and her grown children just …take it …help me understand because I’m about to blow a fuse lol.

I'm working on Nazutibic [na.zu.ˈti.bik] - a language that genuinely incorporates features from four major language families.

**What we have so far:**
- **Semitic**: 3-consonant roots (k-t-b = ""write""), dual number, vocab like *ʔaba* ""father""
- **Sino-Tibetan**: 3-tone system, classifiers for object shapes, SOV word order  
- **Indo-European**: 5-case system, familiar verbal morphology
- **Uto-Aztecan**: Person prefixes/suffixes, ejective consonants, agentive *-wan*

**Base-8 Counting System:**
They use 8 digits instead of our 10:
- *sifr* (0), *mel* (1), *wej* (2), *ʃam* (3), *ʔon* (4), *ʃelu* (5), *xes* (6), *sab* (7)

When they reach what we call ""8"", they write *mel-sifr* (10₈) - literally ""one-zero"" in their system. So:
- *mel-mel* = 11₈ = 9₁₀ 
- *wej-sifr* = 20₈ = 16₁₀
- *sab-sab* = 77₈ = 63₁₀ (their highest 2-digit number)
- *mel-sifr-sifr* = 100₈ = 64₁₀ (feels like ""one hundred"" to them!)

**Sample sentences:**

*Katab-wan-es ʔalgabra ʃe-mel ndâr-ma-te.*

- **Universal loanwords** adapted: *ʔalgabra*, *ʃokolat*, *kafē*, *ʃaj*
- **Dual tea vocabulary**: *ʃaj* (prepared tea) vs *tē* (tea plant)

**What I'd love help with:**
- Expanding vocabulary with more triconsonantal roots
- Developing the classifier system further 
- Creating cultural context for how this would actually be used
- Working out more complex grammatical constructions
- Maybe a writing system that reflects the mixed heritage?

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

Here we go, Part 5.

\----------------------------------------------

The seventh day was completely normal and nothing happened. I had won...

*Hah, yea right, and pigs will fly!*

The seventh morning came with rain. Not a gentle drizzle, not a cleansing storm—just a steady, relentless downpour that soaked everything and dulled the world into a smear of gray and black. It was the kind of rain that seeps into your bones, reminding you how small and temporary you really are.

I had lived a week by those rules—every circle around the tower, every grain of salt, every phrase whispered into the sat phone. The rules weren’t just ritual anymore—they were burned into me like scars. My body went through the motions even when my mind screamed for rest. Every joint ached as if rusted through, my legs were lead, and my back felt like it had been beaten with hammers. I was sick of it—all this shit. Sick of the chanting, the counting, the salt, the endless paranoia.

I dragged ass over to the little gas burner, and made breakfast. The comforting scent of salted and peppered eggs over easy, the sizzle of a juicy porkchop, and a few slices of toasted bread made the morning a little more bearable.

See, what people don't seem to realize too often is that food—*good* food—is just as important to troops as guns and ammo. There is an entire industry behind the military just dedicated to developing and making good, long-lasting food. Because, as every soldier and marine officer knows, a good meal every once in a while keeps their warriors' morale up.

*And when morale is up, enemies go down,* I thought darkly.

Steam fogged the window as I leaned back, savoring the only normal moment I’d have today. I ate slowly. For fifteen blessed minutes I sat at the desk, fork in one hand, mug in the other. Sweet black coffee, just the way I liked it—a spoonful of sugar, bitter enough to wake me, sweet enough to remind me of mornings that weren’t haunted by rules and silence. For a little while, the tower didn’t feel like a cage. Just a lonely ranger’s post on a rainy morning.

I used my last slice of toast to wipe my plate clean and washed it down with the warmth of caffeine. I wiped my mouth, set the mug down, took a long breath, and then forced myself back to the grind, feeling a little more human again.

I busied myself with the jars of salt in the corners. They’d gone cloudy, dark streaks coiling inside like smoke trapped in glass. I carried each one to the terrace, dumping the tainted grains into the storm. The rain ate them up quick, washing them away into the forest below. Then I refilled the jars with fresh salt. It felt like scooping sand against the tide.

Next, I checked over my pack, making sure everything was as it should be and where they should be. Plenty of salt, a couple spare silver coins, a small bag of nail, and a granola bar for a snack. I loaded the cartridge belt around my waist with spare ammunition, feeling like a cowboy every time I did it. I hefted my rifle, admiring its smooth black finish and the solidity of its old-fashioned American construction. Odd that it seemingly remained unmarred even after the week of battery I had subjected it to, even the old wooden stock had lost none of its dark lacquered luster.

My gaze drifted to the scratched words etched into the rifle’s stock—*“All Souls Hold.”* If I remembered right, back in the days of steamships and prop planes, the tally of passengers and crew was counted as *souls*, a way to strip away ambiguity and remind men of what truly mattered. Almost without thinking, I let my fingers trace the letters, and a quiet strength answered, surging up through the iron itself as if it were lending me its resolve. My chest lifted, my spine straightened, and the creeping fog that had pressed at the edges of my mind all week receded.

My eyes widened in silent wonder at the weapon I held. Maybe my uncle's old rifle, more than the iron-core ammunition it fired, had more to do with hurting the things in the forest than I first suspected. I drew in a long breath then and let it out slow, my mind now steady—focused and unshaken. I checked the time, 9:57am. It was time to get moving.

I stepped for the door and my slightly uplifted attitude lasted a whole 20 seconds before it took swan dive. The downpour hadn't increased, but it hadn't lessened either. I let out a sigh. At least, I didn't hear thunder on the horizon.

The rain made everything worse. I know some people absolutely *loved* the rain, my cousin Amy sure did. But, after my time in the army, I hated any weather that wasn't sunny and mild. The rain turned the tower steps almost as slick as glass, and I had to partly cling to the railing just to keep from slipping. My voice was hoarse as I muttered the numbers, each one echoing in the hollow stairwell like a curse: thirty-nine, forty, forty-one… My chest tightened, my lungs catching on the dread that maybe the count wouldn’t match. But I forced myself onward until I reached forty-five. Landings intact.

As I stepped onto the muddy ground below my tower, my boots made a wet squelching noise I did not appreciate as they were partially submerged into the earth. It slowed my movements somewhat, but I did managed to make it to the grassier part of the clearing after a few minutes. I sigh again as I wiped my boots on the weeds.

The forest swallowed sound, the steady hiss of the rain pressing down on everything until even my own boots sounded muffled. Water trickled off every branch and leaf, filling the air with a ceaseless patter, like a thousand tiny drums. My rifle rode heavy against my shoulder, the stock cool and reassuring beneath my grip.

The first totem stood where it always did—weather-beaten, dark with rain, but intact. Dark, slick with water, but intact. Still standing proud, the carved lines sharp despite the years and storms. I crouched, examining the silver coin and salt circle at its base. The rain had completely drenched the salt, but surprisingly, it had not washed it away. It held, dispersed and somewhat soupy, but it held. I poured more salt on the damp clump, reinforcing the barrier. As for the silver coin, I left as is after checking if it was tarnished.

I rose slowly, my knees protesting, and started toward the second totem. The path narrowed here, roots slick underfoot, mud grabbing at my boots with every step. Water pooled in shallow depressions, and the forest canopy overhead sagged with the burden of rain. I kept my pace steady, forcing myself not to rush.

A hundred yards out, I slowed.

The second totem was just visible through the curtain of rain, standing in its little raised clearing like a silent sentinel. I was about to continue walking then—

She was there.

The girl in the red raincoat.

Except she wasn't a little girl anymore, she now looked like a young twenty-something, like she was a completely different person dressed for an afternoon stroll through the woods, but still wearing the same bright red raincoat.

She stood directly on the path between me and the second totem, no more than twenty feet ahead, as if she’d been waiting. The rain poured over her, but instead of soaking in, it slicked down her hood and shoulders like oil, sliding away in streams that never darkened or dulled the vivid scarlet of her coat. Too clean. *Too vivid*. A color that had no business surviving in this forest of drowned gray and darkened browns.

Her boots pressed against the muck, but left no impression. The puddles at her feet never rippled.

“Heeeyyy"", she said in a sing-song voice, drawing out the word, her head tilting at an awkward angle.

I stood rooted to the stop, cold seeping into my muscles that had nothing to do with the temperature.

""Rainy, isn’t it?” she said. Her voice wasn’t raised, yet it carried clear through the hiss of the downpour, cutting across the rainshower like a blade. Not loud—just certain, as though the rain itself was carrying her words to me.

My chest tightened, the sudden pressure made it difficult to breathe. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

My hands moved on instinct, squaring the rifle against my shoulder, lever chambering a round.

Her head tilted, slow, birdlike. Curious. “But funny, don’t you think? All this rain…” Her chin lifted toward the sky. Then, her voice dropped several octaves until it was nearly a growl, “...and not a single ray of sun...”

I backed up a step, like the words had physically shoved me. They burrowed deep into my gut, and my stomach turned to stone. *Oh God.* I hadn’t realized it until she said it—but she was right. The sheer horror of it dawning on me quite literally too late.

No matter how thick a cloudy day can be, there’s always a fracture somewhere above: a thinning in the clouds, a pale glow trying to break through, proof that the sky was still there. But here… with rain coming down everywhere, there was nothing. No glimmer. No light. Just a solid vault of iron-gray pressing down, heavy and absolute.

*I had walked right into this.*

I’d gone out on patrol without thinking it through, just leaning on the crutch of routine. My body had carried me down the path like a sleepwalker, while my mind lagged behind. And now here I was...

The forest wasn’t just dark anymore. The shadows between the trees seemed to lean closer, stretching long fingers toward me, reaching, creeping, trying to pull me down into the muck and hold me there. The air was so heavy I could barely breathe, the hiss of the rain a steady whisper that pressed against my ears like a thousand voices all speaking at once, too low to understand but too loud to ignore.

And she stood there. *Smiling with too many teeth.* As if she was the only thing alive that belonged in this drenched, suffocating world.

*Shit. Shit. Shit!*

The rules. The rules—what did they say about this? My mind scrambled through the litany I’d carved into myself over the last week, my heart hammering hard enough to shake my ribs. Salt lines. Coins. The stairs. Don’t answer when they call your name when you open the tower door. Check the totems. Check for unnatural items. Numbered challenge codes.

But this?

No mention. None.

Her smile deepened as if she could taste my panicked confusion. Her boots still hadn’t left a mark in the earth, and the rain kept flowing down her coat without ever soaking in. She raised a pale hand, tilting her head. Not a gesture of greeting—something colder. Almost… invitation.

My knees threatened to give. My throat locked up, the kind of fear that freezes instead of burns. The rifle felt like dead weight in my hands, useless as a toy.

The rain thickened, each drop smacking like nails on the canopy above, hammering me into place. The trees leaned closer, the path behind me shrinking as if the forest itself were swallowing me whole.

I ransacked my uncle’s letter in my head, his scrawled rules, his desperate warnings. My own memories of going over them again and again in the light of the tower.

And then—  
A thought broke through like an arrow cutting through the air.

This wasn’t in the rules, sure. The rules weren't foolproof... *But, it wasn’t in the letter either*.

My late uncle—bless that crazy bastard—had written about everything; the things that whispered under the tower, the mimic-voices, the rules of salt and silver, the steps, the watchers. Every horror had its place in his desperate written ramblings.

But patrolling in the rain? Nothing.

*""Think through the problem, moron.""* The words of my old Staff Sergeant rose in my mine. He had been a hard man, but he cared and looked out for his soldiers. I was there when he shoved a dumb private out of the way and took three AK-47 rounds to the neck.

*Yes, Sarnt.* That meant…

My chest loosened, just a fraction. My breath shook, but it came.

Almost on its own, the rifle in my hand steadied its aim.

If the rules were written to deal with the *unnatural*—then why wasn’t this written down?

Because—God help me—this was *natural*. The weather meant nothing. Maybe it wasn't about direct sunlight at all, it was about the time of day, or the damn alignment of the Earth, or some whatever crazy astro-hocus-pocus that controlled the movements of these *things*. Or maybe it was as simple as physics, the UV rays coming down even if the sun is obscured, which is why even on cloudy days, staying out too long still sometimes gave you sunburn.

That didn't matter, though. What mattered to me was that this was another test.

The woman before me shifted slightly. A subtle lean, a sway forward, the way people do when they’re about to speak again. Skin the pallor of death, eyes beginning to hollow. I caught the briefest ripple at the edge of her jaw, like her skin didn’t *fit right*. Like the mask was slipping, sensing her triumph was close.

I knew and half-sensed another presence directly behind me. Something sneaking up close.

They were trying to trick me into making a mistake, into abandoning my patrol. I had a distinct feeling that if I broke and ran from this thing, I was a dead man; the rules would be broken and it would allow whatever was coming up from my six to skewer me.

I let my face take on the look of abject terror, hamming it up, and my body tensing as if I was about to run.

She opened her mouth—too wide, too sharp—

Then with total malicious intent, I grinned and I squeezed the trigger.

The crack split the suffocating rain like thunder from on high.

Her head snapped back, hood tearing away, and for a fraction of a second I saw it: a blur of black veins writhing under pale skin, teeth that were too many, too jagged, before the whole shape unraveled like wet paper in a fire.

The forest seemed to recoil, every branch shivering as if the shot had ripped through more than flesh. Behind me, something vast and unseen let out a guttural hiss—like an animal, but deeper, the sound of stone grinding on stone. It rattled through the soaked trees, vibrating in my bones. But it didn’t strike. Not now. Not after I didn't take the bait. I advanced, cycling the lever.

I fired again. The not-woman staggered, half her face a ruin, and now her chest had a hole right through, but she didn’t fall. She twitched, convulsed, and then tried to bare her razor sharp teeth towards me through the wreckage of her jaw.

Just like our first encounter, I noted that while every other thing I shot in this forest seemed to go down with one or two hits, she—or rather *it*—simply refused to die. *Maybe it's some kind of boss monster or something, like in the video games*...

Kept advancing. The rifle’s lever clacked loud, I pulled the trigger a third time. The round tore into her, the force driving her back two, three paces, her arms flailing like a marionette with its strings cut.

The lever snapped home again, slick with rain, my hands moving with grim certainty. The smirk on my lips curled into a sneer, a feral baring of teeth. “Yeah,” I muttered under my breath, sighting her again, “let’s see how many times you get back up.” My voice was cold as steel.

The forest was holding its breath now. Even the rain seemed quieter, muffled by the tension, the smell of gunpowder cutting through the petrichor.

She—no, *it*—shuddered, arms spasming at its sides. The red coat hung wrong now, fabric twitching in places no wind touched. Her head jerked once, twice, like something inside was fumbling with how to wear her face.

I didn’t give it the chance. The lever clacked, smooth, certain, my motions honed into ritual. I fired again.

My fourth round took the rest of her head away, showing a fleshy neck that wasn’t flesh at all—slick, pale, twitching like raw muscle that had never known skin. Her body reeled, knees buckling, it half staggered half stumbled from the path, seeking the refuge of the trees.

I took another step forward. The thing behind me roared, trying to draw my attention away. I kept my aim true and fired again.

The final shot partly launched the stumbling form of the creature before me into the shadows, taking her beyond my sight. Not missing a beat, I turned in one smooth motion, cycling the lever again, and fired.

The beefy 45-70 iron-core round tore into the side of a fleeing... *thing*... that resembled one of the monstrosities that charged me at the supply drop yesterday. It reeled and let out a piercing screech, but kept going. I did not let the thought that this hulking horror was behind me the entire time and fired a final parting shot that missed the creature, the round embedding hard into a tree, as it too broke into the shadows of the woods.

Then, everything was quiet again. The downpour of the rain had eased a bit but was still ever-present. The steady hiss on the leaves, the dripping against my shoulders, the patter on the hood of my jacket.

I stood there for a long moment, rifle still raised, barrel smoking, my breath cutting sharp in my chest. I scanned my surroundings, noting that the pressure on my chest had vanished. My pulse was still hammering, but the gun in my hands was steady. That steadiness mattered more than anything.

I forced myself to lower the rifle, the rage and coldness that had possessed me bleeding away like the raindrops. My thumb brushed the shallow grooves of *All Souls Hold* and my uncle’s written words came back, not the warnings this time, but the rhythm: *Patrol. Totems. Salt. Steps. Watch.* The routine.

I still had a patrol to finish and a duty to do.

I started for the second totem again, pulling out rounds from my cartridge belt and methodically inserting them into the rifle.

The mud sucked at my boots as I passed the second totem. It stood untouched, the carvings slick with rain, the silver coin gleaming faintly against the wood. Whatever had tried to stop me hadn’t managed to touch it. That counted as a win.

I pressed on, every step louder than it should have been, every breath a signal I couldn’t take back. The forest didn’t move, but I could feel it—eyes pressing on me from angles I couldn’t turn fast enough to catch. The kind of gaze that dug between your shoulder blades and tried to freeze you mid-stride.

I kept walking. Not slow, not fast. Just steady.

The rest of the patrol passed like that: me, the rain, the trees. No voices. No false faces. Just the constant prickling certainty that something was there, dogging my steps just out of sight, but temporarily retrained.

Third totem, *clear.* Four totem, *clear.* Fifth totem, *clear.*

By the time the tower came back into view, I was soaked through and wrung out. But the line held. The totems were standing. And I hadn’t broken the rules.

That was enough for now.

I climbed the steps with more deliberate intent that usual, counting out loud even number. 40 steps, three landings. I paused, looking back down. *Damn, definitely fewer.*

Strangely enough, I did not feel the same amount of heart-stopping dread I normally would. Maybe because I was just tired from... everything... and *didn't* *feel like being afraid* tonight\*.\* Hah. I pulled out the rules, something I hadn't done in a while. I looked at **Rule 3**:

**Each time you climb the stairway to the top of the tower, you must count out loud the number of steps. There must be 45 steps and three landings, with the final one having the door to the lookout. If the number is different when you reach the top, sprinkle salt on the last landing and touch a silver coin to the door handle before opening the door to the lookout.**

I did as instructed, and opened the door. I fully expected for some foreign object to be in the room this time and began checking the entire place over. But, oddly enough, there wasn't anything. The bed with the metal frame, the metal desk, the two metal chairs, the small fridge, the metal gas stove, the compartment for the solar batteries, the digital clock on the wall, the coat rack that I used as a rifle rack, and the shelves with the books. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I decided to give a report tonight, even though the totems themselves were not disturbed, the thing had tried to interrupt my patrol and I thought that deserved a check-in. I picked up the satellite phone and dialed. It rang only once before being picked up.

""I know Six has seen Eight Thirteen and Two are there.""

I waited.

""Confirmed.""

Then I gave my full account of everything that happened that day, including some of what I realized, even though that may not have been appropriate for a report. But, hey, I had a captive audience, so I decided to vent a little.

About fifteen minutes later, I finished, waiting for their customary acknowledgement.

""Acknowledged. Four has One, but waits for Two. Exemplary work on your first week, Ranger. Continue watch.""

Then the call ended, and I sat there dumbfounded. *Exemplary work*. I'm not gonna lie, I sort of teared up a little afterwards. At that moment, after everything that'd happened, upending my life and moving all the way out here, being under constant threat from supernatural creatures, with very little human contact, after all the pain, and terror I felt, that little piece of human acknowledgement, even if it was some basic corporate spiel, it made my burden just a little bit lighter.

As the clock hit 4:00pm, I made myself another early dinner of a couple grilled chicken and cheese sandwiches, a little worried that I had been eating only two meals a day lately.

Then, went out onto the balcony to do some real fire watching, and maybe to do some introspection. I had a lot to think about. The rain had finally stopped an hour ago, so I slung my rifle and did slow circuits around the tower, scanning the vast wilderness. Looking, but not really seeing. I must have been out there for a little over two hours because before I knew it, the sun had sunk over the horizon and the day had lapsed into twilight; the orange and reds of sunset giving way to the darker blues of early night.

That’s when I saw them.  
Shapes stirred at the edge of the treeline, black against the pallid wash of moonlight. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks, but then they began to move—dozens of them, slipping out from between the trees like shadows learning how to walk. My breath caught in my throat as I realized they weren’t moving right. Their strides lurched, staggered, joints bending in ways that made my stomach twist. Some dragged limbs behind them like broken marionettes, others twitched with a jerking rhythm that seemed to mock the motion of walking.

Halfway between the tower and the trees, they stopped in eerie unison, as though some unseen hand had given a silent command. Their heads tilted upward, and the light caught on the shapes above their shoulders—antlers, great racks of bone jutting out like pale, jagged crowns. My blood iced over. Every one of them was staring at me. Even from that distance, I could hear it: the sound of their breath, wet and rasping, punctuated by low, guttural growls that vibrated up through the wooden beams of the tower.

I clung to the railing, knuckles bone-white, the iron taste of panic thick on my tongue. Sweat began to run freely down my face despite the chill autumn air. My heart pounded so loud I was sure they could hear it, could smell the fear leaking off me.

And then, without warning, one figure broke from the horde. Smaller. Slighter. It moved differently from the others, not with their grotesque, twitching gait but with a smooth, steady stride. It came forward until it stood in the open, directly beneath the tower. My stomach turned to ice.

It was her.  
The woman in the red raincoat.

Whole. Unharmed. As if the bullets I’d put through her body meant nothing at all. She tilted her head back slowly. The hood slid away from her face, and what it revealed made my stomach twist—an expression of calm, almost gentle serenity, a smile stretched just a little too wide, too knowing. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t right.

But instead of drowning me in more fear, the sight carved through the terror that had held me frozen. Something inside me solidified, steadying against the weight of her stare. The panic ebbed away, replaced by something hotter, sharper—resolve, and beneath it, the ember-glow of anger.

In one quick motion, I unslung my uncle's rifle from my back and gripped it firmly in both hands. Then, as locked my gaze on that inhuman smile, I pulled the lever back with a sharp, defiant snap; my resolve and intent loud and clear in the gathering darkness.

We held each other’s gaze for what felt like minutes, though it could only have been seconds.

Then—without a word—she turned. And as if bound to her will, the horde turned with her, their movements slow, deliberate, retreating step by step into the treeline. The night seemed to swallow them whole, but not before she glanced back one final time.

That smile—stretched too wide, gleaming with promise—spoke of horrors yet to come.

I understood. Tonight was a declaration. Whatever ruled these woods, whatever wore her face—it wasn’t mocking me anymore. It was acknowledging me. The fear was still there, a cold weight in my chest, but it no longer owned me. What filled its place was sharper, hotter. Resolve. Rage. The kind that doesn’t fade when the night ends.

I had no doubts of whether they would outlast me, they'd done it to my predecessors. To my uncle. *But, I was going to make damn sure to make them work and bleed for it.*

\----------------------------------------------------

Well, that's the story of my first week on the job.

There is a still lot more stuff I wanted to tell. Stuff that I realized later on, not only about the things in the forest, but about myself too. Some of you probably caught that little hint at the beginning about my mom locking herself in the basement once a month, screaming for hours until sunrise. Yea, that ties in to my bloodline, and why Mom's side of the family has always been chosen to do this kind of work.

What else? I wanted to talk about that time I actually found my uncle totally not dead, and then lost him again 20 minutes later. That one was a sad story. And the visit I had to make to Amy and her family after I got back practically tore my heart out.

Or, how I found out that I wasn't the only Ranger patrolling a set of totems out here. Turns out there were five of us. *Five rangers, checking on five sets of five totems*, spread out over a thousand square miles. Yea... read into THAT whatever you want. 

How bout that time when the things in the forest pretended to be a bus full of lost sorority girls? *Because why the hell not, right?* And you know me, of course I did hit those... with 45-70 Gov't rounds, because I'm not a damn idiot even if I hadn't gotten laid in like 3 years at the time. Kept running into half-naked women all that week.

Or, that time when I and another veteran ranger helped locate and defend a crashed spec ops unit; ""Black Hawk Down"" style. That was a harrowing couple of days. If you think the mutant chargers that attacked my supply drop that first Saturday were bad, they were timid little deer compared to what those operators were sent to deal with. I still have nightmares about it. Although I did get a really nice set of custom iron-bonded body armor for my trouble.

Or, that other time I found out that a troupe of cub scouts and their two scout masters went missing in my area. And I walked out onto the balcony one night and yelled out that if they didn't give the kids back I was gonna start doing some *\*really\* crazy* shit, then the next day, I left a single tank of kerosene ringed with salt and iron nails along each of the paths between totems. *Five tanks in total, carried out over five days.* Well, those cub scouts emerged onto the main trail towards a local ranger station exactly seven days from when they went missing, looking only a little malnourished and bruised. Of their scout masters, there were no signs, but I wasn't going to be too pushy.

Or, about how, over the years, I realized that surviving out here depended on attitude... A lot of people theorize that these things predate America, and probably goes all the way back to the Ice Age. Now, whether or not that theory is true, we, humans, are intruders on their land. Yes, that includes the Native Americans that were here before the U.S. of A. So, I've read some of the horror stories online that are like mine, you see. *Believe it or not, a few of them are true.* Some people, even a couple of my fellow rangers, believe that we have to behave like embarrassed uninvited guests; *try to minimize our impact here and establish some sort of balance with the rules as the baseline. Live and stay out of these things' way.* And yea, that works for some... but not all. Heck, not even for most.

You see, no matter how you pander and respect the rules, these things are never going to look at you as anything other than food at best, or playthings at worst. *They're assholes.* We're always going to be pigs to the slaughter for them. So, the way I figured it, if I'm an intruder in their land anyway, I was NOT going to behave like an embarrassed houseguest. *I was here to rob the place. I'm doing a B&E (breaking and entering).* If I was going to be a pig for the slaughter, I mind as well be a wild boar; responsible for 20% of hunting fatalities, because them spicy pigs don't mess around. *I was going to make them actually work for it.* And you know what? Here I am 18 years later; a little more gray, a little more seasoned, *but still alive, still defiant. Still doing my job.*

Well, that's about all I have to write about. It'll be October in two weeks, and I gotta start getting ready... Probably save some of my cooler stories for down the road.

Til then, this is James, Ranger of the Watch. Signing off.

1mwtxrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mwtxrb/castenada_part_1/,Castenada (Part 1),"I hadn’t planned to linger in Castenada. The funeral wasn’t until tomorrow. Just a short service at Ashton Methodist. My uncle didn’t have many people left. Neither did I.

I figured there would be hymns and polite nods and maybe a few too many stories from people who barely knew him. Then we would all drink weak coffee in paper cups and stand in front of a folding table of sweating casseroles in the church basement. Then, maybe, I’d drive home.

It’s a fairly remote town that’s not usually mentioned in casual conversation, though the odd trucker may pull over here to grab a bite or to stay the night. The center of the town, a dozen brick and mortar buildings housing small businesses and civic offices, is surrounded by a few branching suburbs and farms. The steep hills that crest the horizon almost seem to close Castenada off from the rest of the world like a great wall of rising forest.

My first stop in town was the local diner, The Coronado ‘51. As I passed through a red door with an open sign hanging in the window, I was welcomed to an open dining area with a few booths, tables, and a counter surrounded by stools with worn vinyl cushions. A few patrons were sparsely seated throughout the diner, none of them looking up as I entered. The diner’s faded pink walls were clad with various pieces of Americana: a framed picture of Bill Clinton, an aluminum *“No Parking”* sign, and a collage of newspaper clippings.

A young waitress balancing trays in her hands passed by me. The rain-streaked reflection of the Coranado's illuminated sign outlines her smooth features and brunette hair a vibrant hue of orange with a dim hue of blue from the dying *""51.”*

I took a seat at the counter, choosing the far end near the window. The red vinyl cushion gave a tired wheeze beneath me.

The waitress returned a moment later. Her name tag read *“Bonney”.* Her eyes flicked up to meet mine just briefly before she dropped a menu in front of me with worn, laminated plastic that curled slightly at the corners.

“Coffee?” she asked. Her voice was soft, barely louder than the rain tapping the windows.

I nodded. She poured without waiting for my answer. The mug was already on the counter. I wrapped my hands around the ceramic. It was chipped at the rim. The coffee was black and far too hot, but I made no move for the creamers.

She leaned against the counter. “Just passing through?”

“Something like that.”

I looked up. She wasn’t looking at me. Her eyes were fixed on something beyond the window, out toward the street. In the forest across the road, the glinting of lights swept through the ferns. It was impossible to tell for sure through the dark shade of the trees, but it appeared to be people with flashlights walking in a uniform line. I could just make out the reflective vests and slow, sweeping motions of a search and rescue party. Maybe six or seven of them, walking shoulder to shoulder, carefully combing the underbrush.

Bonney followed my gaze. “Been out there since this morning,” she said quietly. “Fourth day.”

“Fourth?” I asked, eyebrows raised. “That long?”

She nodded, lips pressed into a line. “Girl named Aubrey Parks. Eighteen. I heard she was hiking to Dead Man’s Curve and never came back.”

I let that sit for a moment, watching the steam curl up from my coffee. Outside, the searchers’ lights swept back and forth in practiced arcs up the hill.

“What’s Dead Man’s Curve?”

Bonney hesitated. “Old mine road. Abandoned. Most of us grew up hearing stories about it.”

Outside, the last of the lights had disappeared. The forest had suddenly become a wall of black silhouetted by the evening overcast.

I let the conversation trail off. The silence was broken only by the soft clink of ceramic as she poured another refill for an older gentleman further down the counter. I let my eyes drop back to the menu, but the letters had blurred. My appetite had long since evaporated.

A few minutes passed. Maybe more. I left the coffee half-finished and reached into my coat for a few bills, tucking them beneath the edge of the mug like a folded apology.

When I stepped outside, the neon sign above casted flickers of color onto the wet pavement. Coral, violet, and sickly blue danced on puddles. Across the road, the forest loomed. No more flashlights. No more voices. Just the thrum of rain on asphalt and the faint rustle of wind in the trees.

I should’ve driven to the motel, checked in, pulled the scratchy comforter over my head and tried to sleep. But I didn’t. Something about the darkness across the road made it hard to look away. I was a firewatch during the warmer months of the year so I had some degree of training for wilderness survival and search and rescue. Something compelled me to enter, though it’s hard to say if it was necessarily out of the kindness of my heart. I opened the glove box in my car and pulled out the flashlight I kept tucked under the manual and a few dozen expired copies of my insurance and registration.

I crossed the road, each footstep kicking up a bit of water. The trail wasn’t marked, but there was a slight depression in the underbrush where boots had trampled the wet leaves and pine needles flat. I followed it in.

The sound of the rain dulled and soon all I could hear was the wet crush of my boots. Branches scraped against my coat. My breath fogged in front of me. After a few minutes in, the slope began to rise. The ground became uneven, pocked with rocks and narrow rivulets of water. The boot prints were no longer visible.

Several minutes passed and the path sloped downward, narrowing as I went. My flashlight’s beam wavered across wet bark and tangled underbrush. Then, just ahead, something caught the light. Half-hidden beneath moss and root: a cave mouth carved into the hillside. The stone around it was marked and worn. A metal sign, rusted to near illegibility, had been bolted into the rock long ago. The letters were corroded but still legible if I squinted, read:

***Tatonga Cave***
***(Closed to the Public – 1963)***

The name sparked something in my memory. I had seen it once in an old article, maybe. Something about an archaeological dig back in the sixties. They had found human remains here, more than 15,000 years old. Not scattered or dumped, but carefully placed. The cave was then sealed shortly after, but I couldn’t remember why.

I knelt near the opening, brushing aside a veil of moss. I crouched, bringing the flashlight down. The stone at the cave's lip was adorned with elongated muddy handprints. Still wet and recent. I froze. My skin prickled. Something about the way the fingers splayed across the stone looked like someone or something had crawled out.

Behind me, the trees groaned with wind that hadn’t been there a second ago. A gust blew past the cave mouth and I heard a kind of strained yowling I couldn’t place. *Cougar maybe? A person?*

That was enough.

I turned and started back the way I came. The path I'd taken in had vanished into a smear of black trunks and wet undergrowth. Everything looked twisted and unfamiliar. The light from my flashlight bounced uselessly from tree to tree. *What the fuck was I even doing out here?*

I crashed through thickets, half-slipping down the slope, my boots slapping against mud. I don’t know how long it took to find the road. Eventually though, I broke through the treeline gasping.

My car waited across the road in the diner parking lot. Only once I was behind the wheel did I let myself breathe. I fumbled the key into the ignition with hands that refused to steady.

I drove to the Lucky Star Motel and I didn’t check the rearview once.




Ashton Methodist sat hunched at the south end of town, its sloped roof sagging like tired shoulders. The steeple didn’t quite stand straight anymore. Paint peeled along the windowsills. The historical photos in the foyer suggested the church had been rebuilt four or five times.

There were only eleven people in attendance. I counted them twice. Most of them older. One wore a military service pin. One had a walker. A few whispered greetings, unsure if they should know me. I sat in the second pew. Not out of grief, but out of obligation.

I hadn’t seen my uncle in nearly a decade and a half. I didn’t dislike him, but there just wasn’t much between us. He’d lived alone. No spouse, no kids. A part-time job at the hardware store between odd jobs until his health started to go. The pastor gave a kind of wallpaper eulogy. Things you say when there aren’t stories to tell.

I caught myself zoning out. I kept thinking about the night before. The forest. The sound from the cave. The wet handprints. It felt like it had followed me here.

A hymn started. Voices rose, uncertain and off-key. I didn’t sing.

The pallbearers lifted the casket through two large oaken doors. Ashton Cemetery sat just beyond the churchyard, past a rusted fence half-swallowed by ivy. A small backhoe waited at the edge of the lot, idling quietly.

I stood with the others as they lowered the casket into the ground. A minute later, people began to drift away in twos and threes. Someone offered a weak smile. Someone else patted my shoulder.

When the service ended, I walked back into the church with the others, accepted a cup of coffee from a man with mottled hands, and listened to polite murmurs about the weather. I nodded at the right times.

“Mind if I join you?”

The firm voice came from just behind my shoulder. I turned to see a tall man in a brown canvas jacket, gray at the temples, a sheriff’s star pinned just above the breast pocket. His eyes were tired, but clear.

“Lucas Buckley,” he said, offering a firm handshake. “Sheriff.”

I took his hand, trying to match his iron grip. “Thanks for coming. I’m Jezebel. Niece.”

“Nice to meet your acquaintance. Yeah, he kept to himself mostly, but he was a good man. Quiet type.” He took a sip of his coffee. “I’m sorry for your loss.”

“I appreciate that, but we weren’t that close. I didn’t grow up around here.”

“No, I figured,” Buckley said. “Small town like this? I would’ve seen you.”

I tried to smile. I failed.

“Well, if you need anything while you’re here, I’m usually at the station towards the center of town. Your uncle left behind a few things we’ve got in storage there. Didn’t seem like junk, but it’s not evidence either. Figured someone from the family should decide and to my knowledge we couldn’t find a will.”

He lingered for half a second like he wanted to say more, but then just tipped his hat with a curt grin. “Take care now.”




The Castenada sheriff’s station was a low, one-story building. An American flag hung limply over the Oregon state flag out front. I parked by the entrance and walked past a fading mural of a bald eagle that covered half the station’s outer wall. Its eye had long since peeled away.

I pushed through the glass door into the stale, florescent glow of the lobby. The lights buzzed faintly overhead. A deputy at the front desk looked up from a magazine he was reading. Late twenties, maybe. He had the sort of face that sharply contrasted with the sheriff’s hard creases and deep wrinkles.

“You’re the niece?"" he asked, already reaching behind the desk.

I nodded. “Sheriff Buckley said there was a box?” I glanced down to the magazine he was reading to notice there was bold, red letters that spelled out *“FINGERS”* on the cover.

“Someone left it out front about a week after he passed. No note. Just set it right there on the bench outside the station one morning.” He set a battered cardboard box on the desk. The top flap had already been cut, the tape lazily re-pressed to keep it shut.

“And it’s his?”

He nodded. “Yeah. We opened it just enough to be sure. Couple things with your uncle’s name on ‘em. But we didn’t sift through it. Figured that was for the family.”

I carried it over to a plastic chair by the wall and peeled back the flaps. Inside was a flannel shirt, neatly folded. Beneath that, a manila envelope containing letters, some bills, and what looked like a clipping from an article. And at the very bottom, under a curled notebook with frayed corners, sat a black floppy disk in a plastic sleeve. Written in thick Sharpie across the front label was the words:

***PROJECT SUMMERHOUSE***

I slipped the floppy disk back into its sleeve and glanced up toward the bulletin board behind the deputy’s desk. There, tacked amid faded notices, was a missing person poster; a young woman’s face under the bold letters:

***MISSING — AUBREY PARKS***

The deputy glanced at the box again, then looked back at me with a half-smile. “Anything good in there? You find something worth keeping?”

“Some old letters, a shirt. The usual stuff. Nothing that screams ‘treasure.’” I decided not to mention the floppy disk.

He nodded, leaning back slightly in his chair. “Figures. Most family things end up being that.”




The Castenada Public Library stood at the north edge of town next to a vacant lot overgrown with weeds. The building was a modest, low brick structure with a wooden sign out front that had once read Castenada Public Library in painted serif letters. Now only “Castenad Pub Lib” remained, the rest worn off by years of rain.

I scanned the small space. There were maybe five short rows of shelves, a rack of local history pamphlets, and a computer workstation tucked into a back corner, shielded by a divider of corkboard. The monitor was bulky and beige, the keyboard yellowed at the edges of its well-worn keys.

A single librarian sat behind the front desk, flipping slowly through a paperback with a cracked spine. She looked up as I entered, gave a nod, then returned to her book.

I walked slowly toward the workstation and slid into the plastic chair. After brushing off a scattering of eraser shavings on the desk, I powered on the computer. The screen glowed phosphorescent green. It took its time, scrolling through lines of memory checks and hardware stats. When the interface was ready, I inserted the floppy disk. The drive chattered as the computer strained to read it.

The monitor filled with a grid of strange shapes. Jagged lines intertwined with loops and spirals that didn’t look like any alphabet I knew. The symbols seemed to slither and fold into new configurations. Some of the shapes repeated, like a language. As I stared, my eyes began to sting.

A dry, searing sensation spread behind my lids as I tried to focus. My vision blurred. Tears welled up unbidden. I blinked hard, trying to clear my eyes, but the afterimages of the shapes stayed scorched against my sight.

*“Fuck!”*

With trembling hands, I reached for the drive. The floppy disk ejected with a loud mechanical clunk. I grabbed it as soon as it appeared, shoving the plastic sleeve into my coat pocket like it might burn a hole straight through me.

I stood up too fast, chair legs scraping across the linoleum. The librarian glanced up with a frown as I hurried toward the door. The shapes were folding and unfolding.

Once outside, I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my palms. It didn’t help. A lingering afterimage etched into the backs of my eyes like sunspots, impossible to blink away. When I turned my head too fast, the symbols dragged like streaks across glass. My stomach turned with it.

I stumbled across the parking lot towards my car. My fingers barely registered the key in the door. The lock clicked, and I dropped into the driver’s seat with a dull thud. My fingers curled reflexively around the sleeve. I shoved the disk into the glove box without looking and slammed it shut.

I sat for a brief moment, letting my forehead rest on the steering wheel with my eyes closed. The symbols bloomed behind my eyelids in dull reds and electric greens. They pulsed, twisted, and folded in on themselves like living things. I could feel them curling beneath my skin in the way that you feel a headache rising from the base of your neck.

When I opened my eyes, the dashboard of my car had started to melt. At first I thought it was a trick of the light, but then the contours of my car dissolved into unmistakable long, viscous drips. The windshield and doors bowed out and warped into abstract shapes that slowly seemed to be drifting away from me. The walls of my car disappeared completely and the world outside began to stretch, like I was sinking backward through cellophane.

My pulse hammered in my chest. I tried to speak, but my throat refused to make a sound.

Soon, the shapes that I could still recognize blurred into a dizzying kaleidoscopic mix of vibrant colors. It looked like a blindingly bright oil slick. I tried to sit upright in my seat, but the seat was gone. My hands flailed and caught nothing.

After what felt like several lifetimes, a figure materialized into view. The shape was humanoid and tall, but it was not human. Its head was that of a coyote. Two gilded human hands pressed over its eyes. Its body was wrapped in a radiant, golden carapace. Etched into the surface were human faces, hundreds of them, caught mid-expression: some crying, some laughing, some frozen in abject horror.

The hands across its eyes did not move, yet somehow I knew it could see me. The void around us rippled like heat rising off asphalt, and in the shimmering folds of color, I caught brief glimpses. Images that appeared and vanished too fast to name. *A rusted swing set creaking as it moves. Sitting on a park bench listening to strangers arguing in the middle distance. Choking on water in the deep end of the swimming pool.*

Then the creature’s voice entered my mind, as though it had always been there:

*""Not all who wake remember. Not all who sleep forget.""*

The pressure in my skull built until it felt like my brain would split open. My body, or whatever was left of it, convulsed.

“What- what does that mean?”

I blinked and I was ten years old, barefoot on floral kitchen tiles. A man with nicotine-stained fingers shouted from the other room, slamming a door that shook the frame. My face stung.

*Blink.*

I was in an empty grocery store parking lot at night. A woman I didn't recognize held me tight as she sobbed. There was blood on my palms.

*Blink.*

I was much older now, standing at the edge of a frozen lake. I was holding a box of ashes, whispering a goodbye I had rehearsed for months.

*Blink.*

I was back in my car in the library parking lot. My hands gripped the steering wheel so tight my knuckles were white. Everything was exactly as it was, but it all felt off somehow. Like I had just slipped into the same place wearing someone else’s skin. The afterimages of the symbols still danced faintly in the corners of my eyes.

I was walking a few blocks to my local grocery store for some creamo for my coffee & one of the juveniles from my group dive bombed me!!! 


Twice! So it was no accident. Flew onto my head and grasped my hair. 

I’m confounded? What did I do wrong? 
Was it just a young one being stupid or what?  They def know who I am & that I feed them & give them water.

I’ve tried watching movies with Italian subtitles and watching movies or series through Italian along with a bunch of different apps. The only one I found to be useful was language transfer and I’ve recently finished the course on it. All the Italian YouTubers seem to be quite mundane, boring and very basic (vloggers I mean).  I’m sure these question get asked quite a lot but there always seems to be the same answers like watch a movie in Italian or Duolingo

I have gotten out of that hellish relationship about 5 months ago and I wanted to talk about what happened since im not certain if they are a narcissist but from what I talked about many do believe that. *TRIGGER WARNING TALKS ABOUT VERY TOUCHY SUBJECTS LIKE R--E ACCUSATIONS, P--O ACCUSATIONS, THREATS, SELF HARM*

2021(long distance relationship)
It was 3 years ago 2022(almost 4) I(C) 17M at the time met this girl (J) 16F at the time online(and to add context I was a p--n addict since 8 and watched l--i hentai which i havent watched since 17). J was in an abusive relationship and I was helping her out during it for a few months we eventually started to grow feelings for each other. We decided to date behind her abusive boyfriends(P) back because he would threaten her and her family and also would manipulate her if she tried leaving. Eventaully he found out and she threw me under the bus and she gave him my phone number and he went off on me and we broke up. She then was able to contact me a few days later and we talked for a bit and P went on her accounts and tried to ruin her reputation and got her brother mad at her so she decided to sell a nude of her to buy something for her brother to get him back on his side and asked me if I would judge her I said no(this is important cause the impulsivity becomes a pattern). We then date while they are dating and the same thing happens but P gives up and breaks up with her now it was just me and her. The first few months was nothing bad but only one thing I still had a p--n addiction and she had a boundary that p--n=cheating but I didnt realize how bad it was until later. I was trying to get rid of that addiction and to prove to her that I am going to do what makes her happy so I unfollowed all s--ually explicit contact Like instgram models and whatever, gave her my accounts passwords, and social media passwords.Then the no p--n rule and everytime i saw something inappropriate I would look at her body as well as a rule saying if she wants to post something inappropriate then to tell me first because i wasnt used to it and wanted her to enjoy her freedom. The rest of that year wasnt important since there wasnt much in the first few months other than getting to know our boundaries and being in the lovebombing stage until the next year 2023.

2022
 Over the time of this new rules would be added like no sarcasm, I couldnt eat McDonald's, I had to leave my phpne in the room when i showered, and more but i cant remember i just remember by the end of the relationship it was a very long list at least 30 rules. I lied to her about seeing a naked image of queen Elizabeth and it wasnt on purpose thst I saw it my brother showed it to me and I looked away quickly but I thought I should just keep it to myself since it wasnt anything big and it might hurt her I thought. I Eventaully confessed a few days later and we had our first big argument of course I tried to cheer her up and apologize and tried reassuring her of course she didnt know this at the time but I was still struggling with p--n addiction and didnt want to tell her until I got rid of it and telling her the truth. One day we had an online date and were gonna draw i was using ilulu as a referance to something stupid i wanted to make but because she also found out i used to watch l--i back then she got concerned and we argued and i reassured her. She would then start to slowly need more reassurance a few months into the relationship but it would increase over time slowly where just words didnt work but evidence needed to be provided and the overthinking got worse overtime. She would go through all my history on all my stuff my Gmails, social media, YouTube, and Google while going back years and she would always get insecure or overthink even when the relationship was going fine. I remember asking her one day why she did that and she told me it was because she didnt feel comfortable from how nothing bad has happened in the relationship yet(its been like a few months since our last major argument where I did something wrong). It would get to the point one day we were watching the show freak show or something like that and the nurse got in a dress and started dancing to you dont own me and I was singing cause I loved the song and I put the volume up while we were on call watching it together and because I couldnt hear her she assumed I was looking at the girl weirdly when I wasnt I just couldnt hear her and explained that but she didnt believe me. I did have this worry that the relationship might go toxic like the relationship before J(her names gonna be X)so I would always tell her i was worried about somethings because it would remind me of what she used to do and whatever. J eventually didnt like that so she told me to stop talking about X which was understandable and I reassured her that I didnt like X anymore or anything cause I had her. As time went on in 2023 the boundaries become easier to break because even chest or anything would make her Tell me to look at her nudes which I was fine with until it started getting tiring because I wouldnt be able to watch a movie or show without either looking away or pausing to look at her body since i also liked complementing her body everytime i saw it and if I didnt shed get mad and if I said later I would forget to or she wouldnt let me look later. She would also cross my boundaries of just telling me that shes gonna post herself showing chest or something but she wouldnt so id always be surprised and mad but I would try being supportive but because she would keep doing it over the course of a few months I would start asking her to post herself showing a bit of herself so I could get used to it since obviously she wasnt able to follow that boundary so I would get mad at her but never call her names or yell if anything I was very quiet and high pitched(she didnt like my deep voice). Then I got insecure and we got into an argument since she was wearing thigh highs and a skirt that was making me a bit worried to school since the thigh highs seemed see through but I was wrong and apologized and she told her friends about our argument because I talked to my family about our problems(I didnt want to talk to my friends about it cause I didnt want any problems with them though i shouldve talked to J about it) and her friends told other until one of her guy friend(A) for a year longer than me started to flirt with her(calling her baby, honey, etc and i kept telling her how he was flirting and he only wanted to go Snapchat to say what he wanted without getting caught. She wouldnt block him, let me talk to him, and I dont remember her telling him to stop much and would just avoid his advances and this went on for a few days and i would be telling her how uncomfortable I felt about it but shed still want time until A was exposed for talking about J s--ually which was when J let me talk to A for her and clock him for her but she would tell me if he was just flirting I would've let him stay which destroyed me and I held it against her cause she was going to choose her friend that was clearly flirting with her and not respecting the relationship. There was also 2 other guy friends that made the relationship more tense on my end like her online friend G. J and G were in a groupchat J made a joke about showing her boob's to G and instead of sending her boob's she sent an old man's boob's to G and G was disappointed it wasnt her actual boob's which was weird on both ends but when she told me about it she immediately told me ""im not letting him go"" I was surprised by how fast she told me no when I was just trying to find out what we should do about it and talk about what happened and we did but it left a sour taste in my mouth with that comment and she did say it was because P made her block any guy that was suspicious. The other guy was a friend of hers since kinder called C and he would always be weird to her since he would always want to hang out with her, tease her, and just try to be with her a lot until the school dance and it was the second time I would see her that year and C bought her flowers as a gift to her for getting Cs ticket for him which was weird to me but neither C or G were blocked until C was blocked later since she was tired of me saying how weird it was for C to do that and her agreeing with me then not agreeing with me when asking her mom(her mom was most likely narcissistic cause of how she was towards her). She would also keep in contact with Ps mom since they had a good relationship but would become a problem later on.

2023
She started to get more controlling it seemed like and she seemed to be more paranoid that I was always doing something wrong or cheating on her with porn to the point that she would start telling me to stop eating junk food like McDonald's and it was a promise I made but it wasnt supposed to be taken as seriously as she would because I would just get the coffees or some food on the go but she didnt like it so she would have these bad breakdowns saying I broke my promise and I was cheating on her and whatever when that wasnt true and I would tell her that it wasnt supposed to be such a big thing(which is wrong for me to say since others can take things differently) since it was just food but it seemed like I was getting restricted more and more. I got angry at one point and broke up with her for 3 months throughout those 3 months I was a reck I would drink, smoke w--d,  vape, and go out with my cousins(in the relationship it seemed like there was always a problem with going out with them) and there was this girl called V that I became friends with at work right before ending the relationship and I was mainly looking to hangout with her to make more friends and plus she was cool to me. We would make plans to hang out and didnt and I would sometimes drive her home as well as I bought her a vape and w--d but not long after we stopped talking much. Me and J were in contact for a bit but we stopped talking then we talked again later and then I found out she was talking to her abusive ex P again after a year and a half since they stopped talking which hurt and I blocked her which is where the drinking, w--d, and stuff came from and I told her I wanted to get better for her but kinda lost it until we talked again later on since I promised her id go to her graduation and I did and I bought her a bunch of things knowing it wasnt to get her back because I didnt know if I even could after leaving her but we ended up back together cause we talked after her graduation and kissed. We got back together and one of the problems was V because J thought I left her for V when I didnt and she found out about the plans we made and how I drove her home and how I bought stuff for her(we made plans and stuff but they never worked out one time she asked what she should wear to a rave and I seached up rave clothes and they were all skimpy stuff so I just picked one and said this one and J thought I was wanting to see her in it even though no I didnt care for whst she wore really, I drove her home 2 times and thats it, and I started buying stuff for others not just her even my brother, cousins, J, offered to buy things for my guy friends I made working at my job) which I could understand without context but she didnt believe me and because I didnt block her after she blocked her abusive ex P she decided to follow C again out of spite  which she told me was because V unfollowed me instead of unfolloing her and she was upset that she kept telling me but I would forget which I shouldve done sooner and blocked V. Me and her wouldnt get into many arguments for like a month or 2 saying that she was holding it in because she was trying to change and I wasnt doing what she wanted me to do which was understandable shed get mad which was on me and then she eventually got mad and started threatening me and yelling at me because I wasnt being as romantic or s--ual with her and it was because I didnt feel comfortable with her at all and because all the things from the past felt unresolved and stuff like that. She would threaten to leave me, hit herself whenever things didnt go her way, call me names, and she would yell at me a lot while I stayed calm and tried understanding and doing what I could to make her happy but it always seemed like she would want more everytime I made it to one of the things she wanted me to do like being more romantic, not saying soap or other words she didnt like, or some other stuff that stressed her out a lot. I started to get tired of all the threats because it was almost everyday and I would cry a lot apologize try to change over and over again I would hit my head from time to time because either felt like was never doing enough and that she would leave me and then I stopped crying I stopped bringing up the past I just did what she wanted me to I stopped chasing her and breakingdown everytime she left me I would continue being romantic though less than the first year and I used to obsess over her everyday almost complimenting her everyday sometimes id have bursts of energy where id shower her in love and affection reassurance and whatever she needed but it became less this year and stuff I used to find disgusting was attractive when she did it but I stopped caring about it and more rules were added and this trend wouldnt stop even if I did as much as I did in the begining it wouldnt stop she wouldnt get more lenient and whenever she would mess up I would just forgive her even when she called me a whore, a cheating lying peice of shit, and her saying she hated me so much thst the word lost meaning. When this was happening we planned on moving in together but her parents found out and threatened our family and we spent time apart for a week and then we saw each other again and this would happen twice one at her parents house and the other time us just driving around her city and it was the first time we had s-- and was our first time in general with any person, to me it was magical and I loved that moment it felt like our souls were bound together. The next day she told me i think you R--ed me because my body feels like you did and i retraced everything that happened before, during, and after. I asked her what she ment she consented before and we had a video where she consented before and she never said stop at any point and she told me that when she said ow it ment stop when that wasnt discussed beforehand and I stopped and remember calming her down after and continuing. She would go on to say it wasnt r--e then she would go on to say maybe it was r--e to a yes it was and even though i didnt think so I believed it because her body felt like it and i didnt want to hurt her so I thought it was for a while because it hurt her and her body said so.I would ask to touch her at all after that and be warry of touching her at all becaus either didnt want to do anything wrong. I would eventually disagree with her after discussing it with others and replaying what happened over and over in my head looking for anything that seemed that I r--ed her and nothing would come up in my mind and it would also set up something later on. The last thing that happened this year was me being irresponsible and not doing my college work and instead was playing terraria and I lied to her saying I was doing homework but my brother called me out and I lied saying I was doing homework but she thought I was looking at p--n but I was actually playing terraria.

2024
This one starts off with the amount of paranoia you would expect which was basically everyday everytime even when I did my best to stop all of the paranoia more came even when I wasnt doing anything because i wasnt doing anything and needed to do more of what she wanted me to do. She would start to force me to mas----te(there were times id cry because I didnt want to but still did or else) to her because if I few days went by she would start yelling at me and saying stuff to me hitting herself i would try changing constantly and this year would only keep getting worse over time because it would get more and more intense until the climax of it all was when she caught me looking at p--n because she snuck an app on my phone that took screenshots of my phone and sent it to her without me knowing the day after we had sex but what she didnt know is that I just watched and actually resisted it and went to use her pics instead but because I watched it and lied she got very mad to the point she gave herself a black eye and would get 2 later on because she would hit herself she also would threaten to cut herself because she asked me to confess on what else I lied about and id be forgiven and yet I would be threatened to throw away the vape I had which helped me with stress from the relationship and I also confessed to staying up and pretending to sleep just to watch shows like jjk or one peice or just shows like bojack horsemen because I didnt want to pause every second or remember at the end of the show to look at her body and compliment her which wasnt bad it was only bad because if I didnt do it enough or did it too much or whatever reason she didnt like it she would I assume I want the last thing I see in my mind their body. I wasnt allowed to go to the beach, I lost friends, I pushed away my family, I would go to the gym just to feel good enough, I would basically starve myself by eat 1000 calories or under in protien shakes, I would try to make myself look better everyday was as if I was standing on eggshells, everyday I felt not good enough because id try and try over again changing myself in everyway, I had no one to talk to because I feared of getting them involved and stuff, I would have to take pictures of making my food or else shed think im cheating, id have 3 apps monitoring everything my history and everything I bought the subscription for the same app she used to catch porn for a year to make sure she knew I was serious I put it on my computer I told her who was around me counting how many women and men were close to me telling her my conversations letting her overhear conversations thinking that dying would be easier than staying because to me living with her was the worst and living without her was the worst every time I thought I was right I doubted myself I stopped believing that she was the problem I kept trying to put up with everything she wanted talking to women automatically ment I wanted to fuck them but she could do what she wanted talk to men go to the beach and whatever she wanted because I thought I deserve this I am the problem until I cpuldnt anymore its like I was held down. I couldnt do anything and I was tired I couldnt give I couldnt care anymore everyday id stand at the third floor where I worked at and think what if I jumped with my head looking at the concrete pretending to clean the windows but just looking at the edge everyday talking to people and not telling her because I was insufferable because of how much I talked about my problems and how I was told over and over again break up with her its bad, until 2025 came.

2025

I couldnt handle it anymore she eventaully accused me of being p--o because the p--nstar i looked at looked like my sister which was 11
But I didnt think she looked like her at all or anything, she thought I was one because of my past even though it was 3 years ago, she thought that because my sister was touched by someone else and J knew who it was because she told us before and she still assumed it was me so I freaked out and broke down I thought I changed I thought I did good after I did more but it wasnt enough I hung up and wanted time alone but she spam called me threatening to factory reset my phone and telling my family even though she didnt have any evidence and was doing it all out of assumptions and I talked to my friend about it and he was someone I trusted because he stayed there even after pushing people away. She factory reset my phone leaving me with none of my accounts only for her to give some back later on and I lost my accounts and passwords and a lot of pictures from when I was a kid only some were found. We took a break for a day or 2 and I forgave her only bring it up rarly but she would bring up the p--n over and over again almost everyday until i started doing what she did and brang up what she did with the p--o accusation that she apologized for and said shed change but all i would ever hear is what i did but once i brang what she did up did things change because I thought she would bring up the r--e accusation if I fight back and I was right she did after a bit and I just broke up with her because after that I knew it was all for leverage all of it was fake all of it was to keep me controlled none of what I did could be as worse as her actions and what she did I can admit everything I did and I learned and changed everytime I did wrong I tried making it right or anything to get her to forgive me and not do what I did anymore she always seemed like she never did anything wrong everything had a purpose that was understandable she would say every girl is the same way making me believe it was me but I know it wasnt now. After I left I quit my job I went drinking and just doing the same thing but felt free a bit at beginning we still talked but I stopped talking to her a month later J comes back and accuses me of liking my ex again and that I cheated on her during the relationship and that V told her but she would never tell me with who and would just tell to admit it even when I asked about it I broke down cause she wouldnt believe me at all and I was tired of her and I wasn't doing good mentally already at the time and she though I still liked my ex because I wanted to say something to my ex saying in short way fuck you and J thought it was a confession to my ex but it wasnt and she wouldnt listen and kept accusing so I blocked her and she went to talk shit somewhere to me and blocked me then she tried calling me later on a few days later and she was blocked all I saw was she called at one point and a month after that boom new bf already bought her a ring pop marriage thing where they would get married with ring pops and i was like wow she found someone in 2 months to a month and a half and now shes more public eith him than with me and whatever and thats when I started having more(i forgot to add that towards the end of the relationship it started seeing shadow people and being paranoid a lot and my mind would go blank and just move like an npc and it felt like ants were crawling on my brain it felt like I was going crazy) nightmares of being in the relationship after seeing them together I would go without eating anything but 200 cals a day forcing myself to eat for a week and everytime I ate I wanted to throw up i was afraid of women for a while sometimes having intrusive thoughts that would hurt me in different ways sometimes id think of k---ing myself there were times id become obsessive with her to the point its all I would think is she did everything out of love right.. its been 4 months since then and ive healed a lot and fast cause I stayed on working out I forced myself to eat I talked to my family about everything I got a new job I got therapy and really my life has been getting better I now dont want to be with anyone for a long time and one day I wanna finish the painting I was making her and burn it next to the card I made for her that was as big as my chest(saying this cause im proud of how much effort I put into her I did way more amd the card was 6 pages of full of words) either way ive been improving i got a better job that pay way more than I origally was after the last one I paid off some debt and ive been losing a lot of weight and I feel like ill lose almost all of it by the end of the year and ill be able to get a new car next year in the middle cause ive been better at saving I quit p--n I quit smoking i dont drink or do w--d as much i lost my dream to make Manga and my family says I am not there same person at all at all i got out and just focus on myself since i left my last friend since he seemed to side with her despite being there to witness what she did at one point with the whole p--o stuff snf sure its lonely I only got family but ive been happier than ever and feel better about myself I cant wait to leave this year behind and Im running short on time but thats the gist of the ending this took me 4 hours to write so I hope it doesn't get taken down and people understand since Its the first time ive been on social media and said something in months since I deleted social media if you have any questions im open to answering and what not",1,1755827605.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Single parent with a primary school aged child, so two person household. Looking to minimize my grocery spend.

What are you guys spending a fortnight and what tricks do you have to save money?

I already do the majority of my shopping at Aldi but the ad hoc purchases from Woolworths in between do put a dent in the budget.

We don't eat out and we both pack lunch for work/school. I cook 1-2 days in advance but don't hardcore meal prep because my child can be very picky and temperamental with texture of reheated food.

For meat, I have switched to chicken drumsticks and twice or thrice a week we have four star beef mince. Switch to canned fish and beans on other days.

Stretch eggs out as much as possible.

No soda or drinks.

Coffee is the $9 bag of Aldi ground espresso.

Virtually no junk food or snacks. We spend about $35 a fortnight on chips/chocolate/dip/crackers/cheese.

I've managed to reduce my mean monthly household supplies + groceries from 1200 to 800 and looking to get it lower. Note this is an overestimate because it included some appliances and kitchenware etc I had to spend out on. I don't know what I spend on food alone, but I want to see that mean price trend down over the next few months. If I can get down to $250/fn I'd be thrilled. Could improve food wastage by about $20-$50 a fortnight I think. We are both playing a fair bit of sports so we can't sustain training while living on ramen. I'm pretty much taking a funnel approach of the easiest victories first before I get down to forensically examining each line item.

Red Butte, New Mexico 1873

The New Mexico sun seared Silas ""Silver"" McGraw’s weathered face, turning the

lone bead of sweat tracing a path through his grizzled beard into a miniature

mirage. Dust, his mule, snorted, scattering skittering lizards from their

sunbaked haven beneath a twisted Joshua tree. Even the usually placid beast

shifted restlessly, ears flattened against its skull, gaze fixed on a glint in

the distance that shouldn't have been.

A sliver of impossible silver winked

amidst the ochre and rust of the badlands, radiating an unnatural coolness

Silas could feel prickling at his leathery neck despite the furnace-like heat.

It smelled of ozone, sharp and metallic, like the ghost of a storm long passed,

yet the sky above held only mocking blue.  Dust whickered, pawing the scorched

earth refusing to budge another foot. Silas cursed softly, the rasp in his

voice a testament to years spent howling at empty canyons.

He’d come alone, seeking solace these desolate plains could somehow offer,

a sanctuary from the hollowness carved out by Mary’s passing. The silence of their cabin,

usually a haven of shared dreams and crackling hearthlight, now echoed with her absence

like a phantom waltz.  He rested a calloused hand on Dust's flank, feeling the

mule’s tremor beneath his touch. ""Settle down, girl,"" he murmured, voice worn

thin but imbued with a lifetime of unspoken understanding. Dust leaned into

Silas’s touch, finding momentary calm in the scarred prospector’s worn

presence.

The glint beckoned, promising secrets whispered on the wind. He

straightened, one good eye fixed on the impossible anomaly. A fool's errand,

perhaps, or madness whispering in the desert heat, but a gnawing curiosity

clawed at Silas. With a grunt born of age and resolve, he unhooked his battered

canteen and took a measured swig, then with Dust watching, stepped towards the

silver shard in the heart of nowhere. The desert wind, usually a rasping caress

against weathered skin, held an unnatural stillness as Silas drew closer. Each

crunch of gravel beneath his worn boots echoed in the pregnant quiet. Dust

snorted, pawing the sun-baked earth with restless hooves, but refused to budge

another inch.

The silver shard pulsed faintly, a beacon in the ochre expanse,

emanating a low hum that vibrated through Silas’ canteen and set his good eye

aquiver. It shouldn't be here, not amidst these wind-sculpted canyons and

scrubby brush. Mary always said he chased fool’s gold, but this felt

different—a glint of something beyond earthly reckoning. He clutched the worn

leather locket containing her faded portrait, a sliver of rosemary tucked

within, its scent faint yet familiar against his calloused palm. Silas leaned

on his gnarled walking stick, the protest in his knee a dull ache amplified by

age, before steadying himself and pressing onward.

He stopped a pace from the

shard, its surface rippling like disturbed water. Then, with a groan that split

the silence, the ground convulsed beneath him. Jagged fissures spider-webbed

outwards from the silver anomaly, dirt and stone erupting skyward in miniature

geysers. Silas stumbled back, instinct warring with morbid fascination. The

locket flew from his grasp, clattered against a sun-warmed rock, then vanished

as a shimmering dome of iridescent light engulfed the shard, expanding to

encompass him. Trapped within its wavering periphery, Silas stared at the

coalescing silver, no longer a shard, but a vessel—a silent, wounded ark

fallen from the stars. He reached out, calloused hand trembling, towards the

humming surface, drawn inexorably into the impossible.

The ground stilled, the fissures sealed as abruptly as they’d opened.

The shimmering dome contracted, revealing a figure against the vessel’s

opalescent curve. He stood tall, humanoid in form, clad in torn silver fabric

that clung strangely, rippling with displaced light. Silas blinked,

one eye watering from grit and the other struggling to reconcile sight with logic.

A prospector his whole life, he squinted at the impossible scene.

“Wraith caught in a heat shimmer,” he muttered, more to himself than the

silent Dust cowering at the edge of the clearing. Then, with practiced economy,

Silas unstoppered his canteen and poured water onto the parched earth before

the figure’s outstretched hand. The liquid sizzled, consumed in a fleeting

violet bloom. He knelt, the effort pulling a wheeze from his aged chest,

and fixed the stranger with a gaze honed for weathered faces, not spectral

apparitions. A flicker of shadow detached itself from the man, elongated and

wavering like heat above hot sand, yet the figure himself remained unmoving.

Then, in a voice clear as a desert wind chime, the stranger spoke: “Water...

sustenance. Vessel damaged. Lone soul seeks aid. Pattern disrupted. Cycle falters.”

Silas squinted at the alien's exposed circuitry, a lattice of violet light

pulsing beneath torn silver. ""Damaged vessel, you say? What sort of repair needs

doing?"" He gestured with his canteen, now empty and useless. The alien tilted its

head, shadow detaching to dance restlessly on the sand. ""Fragment... specific

composition... unique resonance. Absent from this world's stock. Cycle falters

without it.""  Silas’s hand didn't go to his prospector's pouch. It flew instead

to the leather cord beneath his sun-bleached shirt, fingers closing around the cool,

familiar shape nestled against his heart.

He drew it out slowly, the desert light catching the worn silver band.

Mary’s ring.  His thumb traced the simple, smooth curve, worn thin by decades

of love and loss. He remembered the blistering day he’d found the rock; not silver,

not quartz, but a dense, strangely warm lump half-buried in a dry wash, humming

faintly against his pick. A rock that didn’t belong. He’d spent weeks under the

desert stars, patiently filing, polishing, shaping the stubborn, unearthly metal

by firelight until it gleamed like captured moonlight. The day he’d slipped it onto

Mary’s finger, her smile had outshone the desert sun. ""Made from the heart

of the desert itself, Silas McGraw,"" she’d whispered. ""Just like us.""  Now,

the alien’s fractured vessel pulsed with violet light, humming a song that

vibrated in Silas’s bones; a song that seemed to recognize the ring’s

resonance.  Silas closed his eyes for a heartbeat. He saw Mary’s face, not

faded like the portrait in the locket, but vivid and kind, urging him forward.

Her creed wasn’t just words; it was the ring itself, forged from a

strange stone into a covenant of love. A covenant that demanded kindness,

even here, at the edge of the impossible.

""Reckon this is the fragment you need,"" Silas rasped, his voice thick.

He didn’t look at the ring again. He couldn’t. With a final, decisive motion,

he extended his calloused hand, offering the band forged from star-metal and

devotion towards the alien’s torn hull. The cool silver seemed to grow warm,

humming in harmony with the wounded vessel. He released it.  The ring floated

for an impossible second, suspended in the shimmering air near the fracture.

Then, with a soft chime like desert wind through crystal, it was drawn into

the pulsing violet lattice. The light flared, brilliant and pure, washing over

Silas’s weathered face, etching the sacrifice into the heart of the machine. The

alien’s rhythmic hum deepened, steadied. The vessel’s groan softened.

Silas’s hand remained outstretched, empty now, feeling the sudden, profound

chill where the last warmth of Mary had rested against his skin. He’d traded

a piece of his world’s heart for a stranger’s.  Silas squinted, canteen

forgotten.  A sliver of dust on the horizon resolved into a churning cloud,

riders three or four, bearing down fast.. Silas squinted, canteen forgotten.

His hand tightened on his revolver, years of desert living etching worry onto

his weathered face. Dust snorted, sensing Silas's shift.

The violet light from the alien's vessel pulsed with renewed intensity

as he worked the sliver into its torn hull. ""Hide,"" Silas rasped, voice

strained. He lurched toward his saddle, knee screaming in protest. Years

burdened each movement these days. With a grunt, he heaved himself aboard,

the worn leather creaking beneath him. ""Vessel's hold. Don't move. Stay quiet.""

Dust pawed restlessly, already shifting toward the riders' path. Silas urged

him forward, his aged body protesting with every strained stride, but his gaze

held a steely glint.

He would meet those riders head-on, buying the alien time

to vanish from sight. The desert wind whipped at his cloak as he rode, a lone

silhouette against the encroaching dust cloud, a silent guardian in the

unforgiving expanse. The wind whispered warnings through dry brush as Silas

guided Dust toward a narrow defile. Sun glinted off the riders’ spurs in the

distance, their approach inexorable. He angled himself at the defile's mouth, a

lone silhouette against the ochre sky.

Reaching them before they saw the vessel was his only chance. The lead

rider reined hard, squinting through the haze. “Hold up there, stranger,” he rasped,

voice rough as desert sand. Silas kept Dust calm, hand hovering near revolver

but not drawn. His knee throbbed a dull ache with every tremor of the ground.

Sweat beaded on his temple, tracing paths through etched lines of time.

“Lost track of my cattle in this dust devil,” Silas lied, gaze steady. “Storm knocked ‘em

clear out yonder.” The riders exchanged glances, their weathered faces impassive.

Dust shifted restlessly, a low whicker escaping its muzzle. Silas shot it a calming look,

his own hand betraying age with a slight tremble as he held the reins.  The

defile’s entrance masked the vessel from sight, a silent sentinel against the

crimson horizon.

A soft hum vibrated in the air, barely perceptible above the wind’s moan.

The lead rider grunted, “Reckon we saw tracks headin’ south ourselves. Storm done

scattered everything.” He jerked his head toward the distant red dunes.

Silas inclined his head in acknowledgment. Dust shifted again, a near-imperceptible

lurch as the ground beneath them vibrated with the vessel’s silent ascent. The riders,

their eyes fixed on the southward trail, remained none the wiser.  Silas let out a

breath he hadn't realized he was holding. “Head south then, fellers. Good luck

finding yours.”

They spurred their mounts and faded into the swirling dust, leaving Silas alone with the

whispering wind and a sky now pierced by a sliver of departing starlight;a

fleeting silver in the sand. The sun bled crimson into the desert floor as

Silas and Dust retraced their path. Each labored breath rasped in Silas's

chest, a counterpoint to the soft thud of Dust’s hooves against the dimming

sand. The defile gaped open behind them, a silent monument to the fleeting

silver in the sand—the vessel’s departure. Reaching the launch site,

Silas untied Dust’s worn bridle and knelt beside the scorched earth. A glint

amidst the cooling ash caught his eye. Half-buried, smooth and metallic, lay an

egg-shaped device, no bigger than a man’s fist. One obsidian button marred

its surface.  He lifted it, turning it over in calloused hands. Keep or

destroy?  The question echoed Mary’s whispers—her childhood tales of omens

and whispered signs from the unseen world. A life spent on the edge of belief,

she’d clung to those threads of something more. Silas met her gaze in memory,

a ghost of a smile gracing his lips. He tucked the device into his worn coat

pocket, its cool metal a reassuring weight against his ribs.

A silent promise formed; to understand, to decipher. The desert held secrets,

and he would keep the ones he knew close.

The silence of the dunes pressed close as Silas sank against a sun-baked rock.

Dust rested nearby, ears perked in quiet attentiveness. Silas uncurled his calloused

hand from the worn fabric of his coat, revealing the smooth, egg-shaped device.

He turned it slowly, its cool metal surface reflecting the fiery desert sky.

“A whisper of fortune, or a fool’s trick, Dust?” he murmured, more to himself

than the mule. The creature watched with knowing eyes, a low whicker rumbling

in its chest.

Silas chose the obsidian button, pressing it with a hesitant finger. A pulse

of light seared outward, striking a loose stone at his feet. When the afterglow faded,

the stone gleamed an impossible yellow. “By the saints,” Silas breathed, reaching

for the transformed nugget. But his touch met unyielding resistance. The gold felt

impossibly dense, far heavier than its desert-worn size suggested. A ghost of

a smile touched Silas’s lips. He remembered Mary’s tales of prospectors

struck rich yet burdened by their bounty. “Reckon I’ve found my own mountain

to carry, Dust,” he chuckled, the sound dry as desert wind.

He unfurled his worn rope and deftly looped it around the golden prize. Dust

shifted restlessly, sensing the shift in purpose, and allowed Silas to hitch

the impossible weight to its broad back. The sun bled crimson on the dunes as

they began their slow trudge home, a lone mule burdened with celestial fortune,

leaving a trail of glinting gold in their wake.  Silas gazed at the receding

horizon, the desert vast and knowing.

Somewhere beyond the starlight, a balance had been struck. Here, bound to

earth, another cycle turned; man, beast, and an echo of stardust against the eternal

canvas of sand and sky. The cabin door groaned on rusted hinges, the sound as

familiar to Silas as his own heartbeat. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent

of aged timber and woodsmoke, the hearth cold since Mary's passing. Dust motes danced

in the late afternoon light that filtered through the single window, illuminating

the empty chair where she used to sit. Silas traced a calloused finger along the edge

of the rough-hewn table, the egg-shaped device resting there like a sleeping bird.

A knock at the door startled Dust from his slumber by the door. The mule's ears

perked up, then relaxed as familiar footsteps crunched across the packed earth outside.

""Silas? You home, old timer?"" came a voice rough as canyon rock but warm as desert sun.

Silas rose slowly, his knee protesting the movement. ""Door's unlocked, Roy. Come on in.""

Sheriff Roy Cobb stepped through, his badge catching the fading light.

His weathered face bore the same lines as Silas's own, carved by years beneath

the New Mexico sun. He removed his hat, revealing silver hair that matched his namesake.

""Been a spell since I seen you out and about,"" Roy said, settling into the chair opposite Silas.

""Heard you were out in the badlands again. Dangerous country for a man your age

to be wanderin' alone.""  Silas poured two cups of weak coffee from the pot on the stove.

""Dust keeps me company. Besides, the desert's been kind to me these past years.""

Roy's sharp eyes caught the glint of the device on the table. ""What's this

then? Looks like something a fancy man from the city might carry.""  Silas's

hand instinctively covered the smooth metal. ""Found it out in the badlands.

Just a curious trinket.""

Roy reached for it, his deputy's instincts taking over. ""Mind if I—""

Before Silas could respond, Roy had the device in his hand, turning it over with

curious fingers. ""Strange thing. What's it do?""  ""Just sits there mostly,"" Silas said,

his voice tight. ""Haven't figured it out.""  Roy grinned, the kind of grin that comes from

knowing he held something valuable.

""Let's see what makes it tick then."" He raised the device, pointing it directly at Silas's chest.

Silas's good eye widened. ""Roy, don't—""

The sheriff pressed the obsidian button. Silas flinched, bracing for the searing

light he'd seen transform stone to gold. But nothing happened. No pulse of

energy, no transformation, just the quiet hum of the desert evening through the

cabin walls. Roy pressed the button again. And again. Nothing. Silas let out a

long, slow breath he hadn't realized he was holding. ""I guess it's broke,"" he

said, a ghost of his old smile touching his lips. Roy set the device back on

the table with a clink. ""Shame. Looked valuable.""

Silas pushed himself up from the table, joints protesting. ""Actually, Roy... I

was hopin' you might do me a favor. I need to take this to the assessor's

office tomorrow. But I'd feel better with you along. Might be worth somethin'

after all.""

Roy raised an eyebrow. ""You think that broken thing's worth a trip to town?""

Silas didn't answer. Instead, he crossed to the corner of the room where a

vibrant Indian blanket lay draped over something bulky. With a practiced tug,

he pulled the blanket away. Roy Cobb's jaw dropped. There, gleaming in the

fading light, sat a gold nugget the size of a man's head, its surface catching

the last rays of sunset and throwing golden reflections across the cabin walls.

It sat on the floor where no ordinary nugget could, defying gravity and reason

with its impossible density.

""Lord above,"" Roy breathed, taking a step back. ""Where in tarnation did you—""

""Found it out in the badlands,"" Silas said, his voice quiet but firm. ""Along

with that little device. Seems I ain't quite as broke as I thought.""  Roy

stared at the gold, then at the device, then back at Silas. Slowly, a grin

spread across his face. ""Well, partner,"" he said, tipping his hat back,

 ""I reckon we're headin' to town tomorrow.""",4,1755827035.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

2. 1zpresso ZP6 (heard about extreme clarity)
4. Baratza Encore (convenience, but space and clarity issues)

Budget is 20k max. I can get it from US.

So, I wanted to try ZP6 grinding exp and coffee taste to understand what it means when they say extreme flavour notes clarity and distinction.

Only very recently have i been pushing myself to do things i haven’t been able to do before. I’ve been going shopping by myself (i usually need my girlfriend with me) as well as doing short trips on buses. I usually find i don’t feel as bad on trains (probably cause they have bathrooms and my main anxiety is around throwing up) i’ve sat in a coffee shop by myself for an extended period of time and i’m planning on venturing to the cinema next week. 

But i miss my old life, being able to hop on a bus and do a 3 hour trip to wherever. Being able to go for a drink till the early hours of the morning and get a taxi home.  Being able to go for a 3 course meal without eyeing the bathroom the whole time. 

I’ve been to the doctor numerous times, both physical and mental doctors but haven’t been given a clear diagnosis of anything. I was put on medication but had to be taken off for other health concerns. 

If anyone could give me any advice or opinions on whether it is agoraphobia or not i would be greatly appreciative.

She complains about it a lot, says she is getting worse with this as she ages and throws in a few menopause jokes every so often. She sometimes gets upset because its just that bad and will have a mental breakdown. The other day I knocked down her pills on accident because she puts them on top of the coffee machine since ""it will remind her to take them everyday"". I would have put them back no problem, but have no clue where they go, so had to tell her what happened and said that's probably the absolute worst spot you could put them and then she just broke down.

I feel bad because there is nothing I feel like I can do. The only thing I could think of that would help her is literally like a personal assistant, which isn't possible here in the US unless you're rich. A virtual assistant wouldn't work as the things she has to do are physical tasks or tasks you can't train someone to do, she just doesn't have too much free time and when she does have free time she's not very good at using it wisely. She could retire and have all the free time in the world, she still would most likely have this same problem. So I have no clue what to do.

I'm not very good myself at spending my time wisely either, but I am investing money into trying out different online coaches which is helping me tremendously. I would buy her coaching for a month to see if it could help her, but this would just ""add another thing to her lists to do"".

We knew it must have some meaning bc come on, a whole book just lying conveniently there?  In the bts video released just months before now, the book title finally became somewhat identifiable in a strategically placed spot just in-frame. We can just about make out the word “Picasso” on the cover if we zoom in.

[Picasso Portraits by Elizabeth Cowling](https://preview.redd.it/f5ebe2swvgkf1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=c47add3109bceaaa679cd1da3a12a02309f1712b)

  
Let’s not get too deep yet with that guy’s life and conduct, and keep it simple with the most obvious for now. When we think Picasso, we think ~~misogyny~~ Cubism, or at least images of haphazardly slotted together geometrical shapes that somehow is supposed to be an object.



Well what exactly is Cubism? Google lends its strength where I have none once more, and tells me it is a conceptual realism, where the artist attempts to represent real-life objects/people in a way that captures them in multiple angles simultaneously. To do so captures the fourth dimension—time—on the artwork too, because to depict the object from differing views, you would have to either move around the object to observe, or move the object around in space to observe. An example is what Taylor did with the book. In the mv we couldn’t make out the title despite it appearing in different angles in two scenes, then the bts video finally allowed an angle that showed the title. Time that allowed different perspectives showed the partial truth.



Real clever way to drive home the point, Taylor.



The two artists that invented Cubism never said why they wanted to represent objects this way, but art critics had their guesses. One explanation is that, with multiple viewpoints incorporated, the object can be more accurately depicted, without having to compromise the “truth” of its form due to optical distortions from a single viewpoint. For example, the single viewpoint we had of the book had the title so distorted we couldn’t read it, and we know that’s not its shape in real life at all. If we had shots of it from different angles in the same frame, we could more accurately see the full true form of it.



[This is from smarthistory.org](https://preview.redd.it/k8v3nrkgwgkf1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=34394ca2a4d9070ef558fae34ffbada9201abefe)

We can see how the violin painted has multiple viewpoints incorporated, showing details and shapes that would otherwise not be visible from only a single perspective.



Cubism has three essential elements:

1. Simultaneity: multiple angles of object presented at once
2. Geometricity: simplification of figures and objects into geometrical components and planes
3. Passage: a technique of blending and overlapping different planes and shapes so they flow into each other 

  


Obviously “the most effective way to present an object so that viewers can see in their mind the accurate full form” is not the end goal here, or we’d be seeing textbook illustrations from lots of angles in the same frame with scales. “The most truthful way to present an object” is an interesting phrase. Because it may be most truthful to the artist, but deviate tremendously from what another might see. Everyone’s idea of what’s most important to show and in which angle will be different. But the idea is somewhat there.



Also interestingly, I find that if you have no prior experience with the real life object depicted in the cubism style, you would have absolutely no idea and no way to even begin to imagine what the thing really looks like. If the above cubism painting of a violin was the first introduction to one for me, it would be impossible for me to ever arrive at the real violin in my head. The artist breaks down the real thing into parts and shapes, reconstructs them into what they think best conceptualizes the form of it,  showing each part of the object in the angle where its shape is most accurately presented. But as a viewer you need to know the whole first to recognize the parts and details. If the artist gets too detailed, you’d need the title to help piece the whole thing together. If they get even more detailed, you wouldn’t even be able to with a title…perhaps just getting hints of recognition somewhere on the canvas. Something would look or feel vaguely familiar, but you wouldn’t even be able to name it. 



Now if that isn’t an accurate description of us reading Taylor’s art…

  


So now we have the cubism piece, where do you want us to recognize that in your art, outside of the aforementioned parallel, Taylor?

[Drowning in the blue Nile?](https://preview.redd.it/oczm334twgkf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f213f11f84ea9c96cd6a96e5045020897a70100)

Bam. Right on the cover, it turns out.



Obviously we see that there are fragmented parts of her overlapping each other. Parts of her (or her photo, at least) are cropped into geometrical shapes. Geometricity. Shapes and planes are overlapped or blended by similar colors. Passage.



She gives us the original image for comparison, so we can see that:

https://preview.redd.it/7qfu8g8ywgkf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a164dadb9ba2db11391b9630d36b0d7ddc87fba

Her right hand moves a little, left wrist rotates. The leg is observed in another angle. Simultaneity.



From what I can see, only the vinyl variant covers do the same thing.



Here’s The Shiny Bug:

[“I pushed each boulder up the hill…” Dung beetle! Or the sacred scarab specifically?](https://preview.redd.it/9a3se957ygkf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=950033da0eeb214a5f6b160b816915fecba5d4b2)

Again, fragmentations and pieces = Geometricity. Overlapping and shades of background being similar colors = Passage. Backside is in a different angle on bottom left corner, Sleeve is shown with arm raised by the word “Life,” and a different part of the space is shown along the right edge. Simultaneity.



And now “Baby, That’s Show Business” too:

Geometricity. Passage. …Simultaneity?

Is simultaneity in the room with us?



Yes. Yes it is.



Thank you gaylors, I’d never have seen this on my own, I don’t know their faces well.

u/1DMod noticed right away the white women on the sides seem to be the same person. u/ollymoth recognized the black women as one Tori Evans, and u/Hot_Paramedic_5682 identified the other white woman besides Taylor as Audrey Douglass.

And so we have the simultaneity. Two whole women are shown from different angles in different moments.

If yesterday’s ""Beautiful Women"" introduced me to the voices of survivors, today’s book gives us the voice of the woman who has been at the frontlines of this fight for decades.
For those unfamiliar, Sunitha Krishnan is the co-founder of 'Prajwala', a Hyderabad-based anti trafficking organisation that rescues and rehabilitates women and children from the horrors of sex trafficking. She’s also a Padma Shri awardee (2009) which feels like the least the nation could do for someone who has stared down traffickers and corruption alike, while walking into brothels to rescue victims.

The book is part memoir, part manifesto. It begins with Krishnan’s childhood and her own traumatic experience of surviving gang rape at the age of 15, an event that could have crushed anyone, but for her, it sparked a lifelong fight against trafficking. From there, she narrates the birth and growth of 'Prajwala': from a small shelter into a full fledged movement.
The most powerful parts, for me, were her frontline stories, rescue operations, tense negotiations, even the heartbreaking reality of law enforcement sometimes working against her. It’s not a “sit back with coffee” kind of book, it’s raw, emotionally draining, and written with an activist’s tone. And frankly, that tone is exactly what the hour demands. You can’t talk about such darkness in polite whispers; it needs urgency, fire, and the refusal to sugarcoat.

It’s not an easy read, but it’s an essential one. If ""Beautiful Women"" showed me resilience from the survivors’ perspective, ""I Am What I Am"" showed me the sheer grit of the person fighting for them day in and day out.
By the end, I was shaken, educated, and oddly inspired. And I’ll admit, my own “tough days at work” suddenly felt laughably light compared to what Sunitha Krishnan faces every day.

I have an overbearing, emotionally unstable mother. (See previous post for an example) She recently was in the process of selling her mobile home to move in with my brother because his partner is having their second child and my mom was going to help with childcare, cleaning, cooking etc. 

well, she sold her place and was at my brothers house for 48hrs before getting into an argument with his partner about using a pitcher for coffee. Yep. Brothers partner asked her not to use that specific pitcher because it couldn’t go in the microwave or something and my mom basically told her if she’s going to live there and help her out, brothers partner shouldn’t “nitpick everything” to which my brothers partner said “this is my house” 

(for reference though, my brothers partner has never worked even before having one child, never paid a dime towards the house or the kid or anything they own, my mother is the one who paid to get them in the house and bought all their house stuff, furniture etc, and in general if I’m being honest my brothers partner is a 35 year old who sits on the computer playing Roblox all day while sticking her 3 year old child in front of cocomelon so… yeah. There’s that) 

Anyways my mom got very angry when she said it’s “her house” so she got her things and left, to my other brothers place (2 bedroom trailer) but he has Asperger’s (high functioning, but difficult at times) and they’ve been butting heads over little things as well, like he tells her to treat his place “like an infant” so she “doesn’t break anything” which upsets her. So she doesn’t want to stay with him. 

she got 5k for her mobile home btw but she’s horrible with money so she’s freaking out and keeps trying to guilt me into letting her live with my partner and I (who live an hour away for many reasons, my sanity included) and she keeps calling me saying she “can’t believe she’s being treated this way by us”, even though I really have nothing to do with the brothers partner drama but she’s making it about wanting to live with me & I’m trying to help her find a place to live, she wants it closer to me so I said ok, sent her like 30 affordable rentals and I doubt she’s even looking at them because she really probably just wants me to say she can live with me for some reason. But I cannot do it, (she is healthy, and capable of living alone, doesn’t need a caregiver or anything.) 

a couple years ago when I lived out of state with my partner she decided she needed to come live with me so I said ok and she stayed for 2 weeks before being so angry about “the way I was treating her” that she moved back to our home state. All I did was ask her to not come into my bedroom and wake me up in the morning because my partner and I often sleep naked and it’s a bit inappropriate and inconsiderate to him to just come in instead of waiting for me to wake up or text me or something. 

I’m not going to go into it too much but I am 24 years old and I cannot live with her. We do not get along when we live together, there are always issues and she always feels mistreated even when I just want minor boundaries as an adult human. I can’t take it. I can’t talk to her because she thinks boundaries and mental health are ridiculous, and that I’m being cruel to her. 

She said she wanted to come up in my area for the weekend to look for places and that she’d stay in “a gross run down hotel” (she always guilt trips me) for the time being so I said she could spend just the weekend here to go look for places so she doesn’t have to waste money on a hotel but I honestly have a bad feeling she’s going to come here and try to stay and then freak out on me when I repeat why it won’t work and I just want my own space to live in as an adult. 

Because of this she says she “doesn’t know why she’s even alive anymore” and guilts me more and more because I don’t want her to live with me? Am I wrong for thinking that’s a bit much?? She makes me feel like I’m a horrible person for not being fine with whatever she wants. 

I really wish I could tell her to just take a break from my brothers partner, stay with my other brother for maybe a week, a couple days at my place (if she doesn’t get pissed off and meltdown before then, which is 50/50) and then go back to brothers partner and set some boundaries or expectations about things like sharing spaces / items and etc like an adult but she will act like that’s crazy if I suggest it. She can’t have a conversation like that, it’s either let her do whatever she wants or you are a horrible cruel person for telling her not to or feeling any type of way because she’s done so much for you and etc.

It was Ray's birthday so they brought out a cake and we all sang him ""Happy Birthday"". Great conversation and insight, followed by an audience Q&A + a special edited piece that was put together in remembrance of David Lynch, who was originally supposed to Zoom in to the event.  

Once the event ended, you had a chance to purchase meet and greet tickets.  $100 per cast member which was a bit steep if you wanted to meet all of them.  The ticket got you a photo with your own camera and an autographed picture.  This is separate from any VIP meet and greet tickets that were being sold online.  I chose to get one for Ray Wise.  It gets a bit awkward because all the actors are seated together so if you only purchase a ticket for just one of them, it gets weird, for me at least.  Next to Ray Wise was Dana (Bobby) and Sabrina Sutherland.  Bobby started talking to me and I almost didn't know what to do because I hadn't purchased a ticket for him although I wanted to purchase one for the entire cast.  It was too much money to drop all at once.  He told me I looked a little young to be a fan lol.  Ray was very nice and we engaged in a brief chat.  I was informed that I would receive a free signed photo from Sabrina.  She thanked me for coming and not only did she give me a signed photo of my choosing, she gave me a special small memento from David Lynch's coffee brand, straight from David's personal collection.   

Overall I would highly recommend.  If you want to meet the cast, look into the VIP packages.  There's a $300 and a $599 one. Both get you a photo pop with the entire cast and some extra perks/merch.  In retrospect I should have purchased the $300 one. ",20,1755825369.0,twinpeaks,8,0.95,False
1mwt26q,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1mwt26q/return_from_the_wild/,Return from the Wild,"Have any of you ever been out of the country for a few weeks, months, or even years and returned to the US/UK/CA?  Have you looked around and just shrugged?  Like, crap, the US is so terrible compared to where I was involved for the last few months.   

Then you're back, you go on a date or meet a US woman out.  You're in a restaurant or a bar, and she starts playing her games.   Maybe you met her on Hinge, Match, FB, or perhaps she was standing next to you.   

Her energy is terrible. What did you do?   

Did you try to go through the motions, knowing that she was 20% of the women you have dated for the last 2 years?  Do you try to have the inane conversation about her cats, her ex, and her kids; rather than the present?   Rather than what you and she experienced, rather than her past, your past, her kids, your kids; did you talk about doing something tomorrow?    Dancing?   Grocery shopping? Hiking?

Hiking?  Women will not go hiking anymore or go for coffee on the first date.   They want dates at steakhouses and not at chain restaurants.   They don't want organic experiences.   

Meanwhile, the women I meet in Latin America are in bookstores, restaurants, and parks.   They aren't ""USED"" for sex, they enjoy sex.   They understand that men and women are attracted to each other.  They get that a man will pay for dinner for his date.    They believe men are not ""using"" them   They want men who are sucessful, sexualy and educated.

So far, I just tap out.

1mwt22m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mwt22m/does_my_friend_f16_likes_me_f15/,Does my friend (F16) likes me (F15)?,"Okay— So basically i think my friend likes me but I'm not 100% sure and I don't want to make the first move if I'm just being delusional and ruin our friendship.

Both me and my friend are muslim, notably not really good ones. She's still a little bit more religious than me, saying how she's saving herself for marriage, how she'd never date a boy or anything— Meanwhile I'm much more 'open' about not caring about rules and stuff. She's not the type to think she's superior because she's more religious, even when I told her that I was pansexual she was supportive. (Which is really surprising given how homophobic+transphobic most of my religious friends are).

Now here's the part I feel really confused on. After since that conversation about my sexuality about two months ago— We've been a lot closer. Before, she was just a friend I'd meet occasionally, text some times. But now, I feel like we've gotten closer. She's been texting me almost everyday now, our calls are longer and I feel like she's a lot more vulnerable with me. Telling me things from her past, about her family  that she doesn't bring up with other friends. 

Now the big thing that happened, for her birthday since I couldn't make it to her original party with all her friends (bcuz i was sick)— So we had our own individual day where we went out to celebrate her birthday so I could give her my gift. We had coffee and went out to the beach. So after swimming a bit, we had to change out of our burkini but the issue was that the beach shower stalls don't lock. She suggested that we both take turns changing inside one stall, to make sure no creep tries to walk in on us. I was a bit shy, but she was a close friend so I thought 'why not'. She changed first, and I immediately kept my eyes down, not wanting to come off as a creep by looking at her when she trusted me. I felt so embarrassed inside the stall with her, but she didn't say anything as it was my turn. I stripped down to just my underwear, feeling a little self conscious and I almost jumped when I felt her fingers touching my shoulder. 

She told me I was pretty and I laughed it off saying she was prettier. She also helped me unhook my bra before going to stand in front of the door. I swear the few minutes it took for me to change into dry clothes, it felt like my cheeks were burning. (I have rosacea so that didn't help either). She was joking about how pink my cheeks were when she was drying my hair for me. She held my hand as we both walked to the bus station, telling me happy she was i agreed to celebrate her birthday even though I missed her party.

Anyways after that we both took our separate buses home and I've developed a crush on her. She's been texting me like normal since, but like some of the time it's super freaky. And I can't tell if it's like regularly how we used to mess around, or if she likes me too. 

Idk should I ask her if she likes me? Pls give advice+suggestions on wtf i should do. 🙏💔",2,1755825335.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

**The Wrong Heir – Chapter 6 – The Shape of Trust**

**\*Muffled steam train travelling SFX during the whole scene\***

Stray! You’re missing everything! We’re flying across the land! Way better than bouncing on a horse! Is this how you always travel?

But how can you be so impassive? Isn’t it a marvel?

Alright, alright, I’ll sit down! But you can’t expect me to ride a train for the first time and not be at least a little excited. Besides, we are in a private compartment. So, it should be fine, right? My first time riding a train, and I do it in first class. Could I be any luckier?!

I’m not sure how I’m supposed to feel about that. You spent extra money just because you didn’t trust me to act naturally? I wish I could be offended, but it seems you were right about me. Still, I reserve the right to pout. Just a little.

Yeah, I know just because we’re leaving Cinderkhaim, it doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods. I’ll be as cautious as a thief in daylight. **\[Soft chuckle\]** Don’t worry so much. We should still be in the clear for now. No way anyone saw us board that train. Between the two of us, anyone trying to tail us would’ve tripped over their own feet. Right?

Considering how you are, I’m going to take that as the complete confirmation nobody knows we’re on our way to… How was it again?

Treblerod, right. A simple town in the countryside, with no presence of the Flock, or assassins, as far as you can tell. Should be the perfect place to settle.

I know we haven’t decided yet whether we’ll settle there or cross the border. But with what you told me about that town; it really seems to be a lovely place. I can’t imagine how nice it must be to live somewhere you can actually see the horizon.

Well, I’m sure *you* could see the horizon, high up in your ivory tower. But night crawlers like me rarely go above street level. So, I will enjoy the change of scenery, thank you very much.

**\*Someone politely knocks at compartment door\***

What’s-

**\[Muffled complaining voice\]** What are you doing?

**\[Whispering\]** Alright, I’ll try my best to act natural. But there was no need to-

**\*Wooden door slides open\***

**\[With faint exaggerated eagerness\]** Hi there! What can we do for you?

Food and drinks? Honey, can we…

They serve coffee?! Really! Make that two, then. And for eating… I’m not really sure. What would you like, honey?

**\*Clinking cups and coffee pouring\***

Then it’s settled. I’ll take one of these too. Thank you.

And a nice day to you too, miss!

**\*Sliding wooden door closes\***

Hmmm… The sweet aroma of coffee. Hard to believe I missed it so much after just two days in that sewer. I don’t know how you managed to stay one whole month without this.

I- I did call you honey, yes. But don’t imagine anything. I was just keeping up the act. I mean, a young and all lovey-dovey couple taking a vacation in the countryside, wasn’t it our cover story?

I think I’ll stick to Stray, then. Suits you just fine.

**\*Stirs coffee\***

**\[Drinks slowly\]**

**\*Puts cup on porcelain saucer\***

Well, I’m glad you like it. Because you’ll hear it a lot more. If… If that’s ok with you, of course. I wouldn’t want… I mean, this is how I called you back when… when I thought you were my hostage.

You’re right. I *did* say that. You’re still very much my hostage, so it’s fine. **\[Pause\]** Is this… Is this how the others do it?

Relationships. I already told you; this is all kinda new for me. I haven’t really had the chance to fall… **\[Pause\]** …for someone. To fall for someone. Right. So, I don’t really know what I should expect. What *you’re* expecting from me…

As if I could believe that! Don’t forget I spend some time watching you, before snatching you. I saw you flirting. *A lot*. You seemed pretty confident, back there.

You mean, all of this was just to keep the façade? That you just… You just never act in a manner that doesn’t directly benefit you as… **\[Whispering\]** …a *you know what*?

That sounds like a very exhausting existence. I get why you wanted to escape it. I don’t even know how you lasted this long... I certainly couldn’t have. Calculating each move, each word that comes out of your mouth…

“It’s easier when it’s the only thing you’ve ever known.” Somehow, that makes it even sadder… I used to think the Flock was rock bottom. But maybe I just didn’t know what rock bottom really looked like…

I suppose there’s no point keeping score over who had it rougher.

**\[Finish coffee in one sip\]**

**\*Puts cup on porcelain saucer\***

Anyway, why won’t we talk about something nicer? All of this is behind us anyway. Can you tell me again about Treblerod? It seems to be such a nice place.

“A commercial crossroads, with a lot of traffic.” Yeah, you already told me that. Why it would be the perfect place to hide. But I mean, can’t you tell me something that’s not just from a practical perspective? Like, what did you think the first time you went there? The scenery, the people, that kind of things. What makes Treblerod the town it is?

I know you weren’t there on vacation. But there must be at least *something* that touched your heart at the time? It can be anything, really.

I’m sorry. I didn’t want to push you.

Really? There is one thing? What it is? Oh please, tell me, tell me, tell me!

Come on, is that the best you can do? A story about buying ingredients to make poisons isn’t really-

Alright, I’m listening.

Oh, I didn’t expect that. Buying compounds to dye your hair. Can you- …really do that?

You even had training in basic alchemy. **\[Sighs in teasing exasperation\]** Is there anything you can’t do?

You had reasons to think your cover was blown before you even arrived in Treblerod. I see. You even used the fact they knew what you were supposed to look against them. Not having matching hair color was almost a guaranteed get-out-of-trouble card. And then?

Do you really think so? I mean, why a countryside apothecary would recognize some blue-blood from the capital?

They were also from Cinderkhaim? Huh, what are the odds?

Come on, I really don’t think you can blame yourself on this. It's not a misjudgment. You can’t account for every variable, all the time. In the end, you're only human.

So, what happened? I guess there’s more to that story than hair coquetry, right?

Oh. Yeah, of course. I was expecting that- Wait! You *thought* about killing them? Meaning, you didn’t? Wasn’t that a risky thing to do? Not that I’m not glad to hear it, but still. This doesn’t look like you. I mean, who you were forced to be…

“They honestly seemed to not care at all?” Did they- Did they suspected what you were?

And you still didn’t… I don’t understand. There must be more to that story.

You talked to them. Okay…

“Talked about Cinderkhaim. How about everything was rotten in corruption and power games. How they escaped all this by coming to Treblerod.” Ooooh… So that’s why you immediately though about this place. You already know from first-hand testimony this *is* really a place to flee the capital.

Yeah, sorry. Please, go on.

They had a goblin? Like… a servant?

A goblin employee? Alright, I wasn’t expecting this. But what does this have to do with anything?

“They seemed to really care about that green pest.” Well, I guess if you travel enough, you’re bound to find the odd one eventually. But I still don’t understand what does this have to do with-

My opinion? If I cared about a goblin? Hmmm, this is kinda hard to imagine, but alright. Hmm… If I really cared about a green imp, I think I… I would have a pretty low opinion of anyone in a position of power? I mean, even more. Meaning... if they knew you were a noble by birth *and* an assassin… They would easily guess you were primarily targeting the kind of person they would wish to see disappear anyway…

Well, I’m flattered you find my deduction skills on par with yours. Really. But still. Even if you were right in the end, wasn’t that still a huge “if” in a plan with no room for error?

“You just couldn’t do it.” See? I told you. That you were too gentle of a soul for that path. And I was right.

I didn’t ask for that, but yeah. I figured you killed your mark. This is still *you* we’re talking about. And that apothecary never gave you any trouble? Not even a friendly attempt at blackmail?

It seems you are a very good judge of character. And to be honest, if I had been in your situation… Meaning, with all the consequences that the slightest error of judgment can induce… Yeah. I think I would have killed both of them.

Hey, don’t look at me like that. I was only talking about my *hypothetical* rise to the ranks of an assassin. I am still absolutely incapable of committing such a thing in cold blood.

“And if it wasn’t in cold blood?” Well… I *did* intend to kill you in self-defense, and you’re still very much alive, as far as I can tell. You may keep a little scar as a souvenir, but I guess this is the extent of my capabilities. No promotion in sight for me. Guess I’ll have to settle for “best thief in Treblerod.” Tragic.

Honestly? I’m relieved. Knowing I couldn’t take a life, even when I thought I had to… It’s like proof I’m still me. And this saves me from feeling like a hypocrite. After that long tirade I gave you about the *supposed* moral superiority of thieves.

I didn’t mean… I don’t think less of you because of your past. I was talking about an assassin who would enjoy doing this for a living. You clearly never would have had to shut your heart like you did if you were a natural born killer. If anything, I can only think highly of you for enduring this for so long and still manage to open your heart. Especially to someone like me. Someone who never expected to be let in…

Goddess, what are you making me say? And you wouldn’t even let me go for a walk in the hallway, right?

We must be as inconspicuous as possible, yeah. So, I really have nowhere to flee. Unless… **\[Pause\]** Mind if I sit next to you? Not to flee, just to hide my blushes.

Well, because at least I won’t have to constantly face your gaze. Isn’t that an old saying? Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer? Well, you’re both, aren’t you? So, yeah. This is my riposte.

**\*Fabric rustles as Crow clumsily move in the tightness of the compartment\***

I really don’t care if you can’t understand all the subtleties of my brilliant plan. Come on Stray, give me some room on that bench.

**\*Drops onto the padded seat\***

Goddess, these seats are ridiculously soft. I don’t think I’ve ever sat on anything this comfortable in my whole life. They might almost rival leaning against you. Almost. But not quite. **\[Pause\]** Speaking of… mind if I just…

**\*Fabric rustles softly as they lean against Stray\***

Yes… that’s it… **\[Sighs in contentment\]** Don’t know why, but being close to you, it makes everything feel… safe. Funny how trust sneaks up on you when you’re not looking…

It was nice of you to share that story. A story of your past that didn’t end in blood. I’m happy to get to know more of the *real* you…

Sure, you killed your mark. But that wasn’t the point to that story.

A story about how, despite everything you’ve been trained for, you still made the right choice. And I don’t care if you brush it off by speaking of calculated risk or whatever. You took a more hazardous path because you’ve been able to connect with someone. Like you managed to reach for me. It would have been easier for you to just use me and throw me the minute I wasn’t useful to you. But you didn’t.

It’s really not the same. I know it might be hard for you to understand it for now, but even if you still gain something by keeping me close to you, you’re not *using* me. Or that would mean I use you as well. Is that what you think about me?

Yeah. This is something different. Something you can’t force. **\[Pause\]** Something you can’t plan.

I won’t lie; it *is* a little scary. Not really knowing where we’re going. But if we’re going together, I’m sure it will be somewhere nice.

I wish we could just stay like this until we arrived in Treblerod. A shame the train doesn’t go near there.

**\[Starts to nod off\]** Yeah, I guess it’s one of the main reasons we’ll be safe there. So far from the capital… Nobody will think of looking for us there. But finishing our journey in horse-drawn carriage… I’m sure it won’t be long before my bottom misses these seats. I bet I could sleep for a week straight if I nodded off on these cushions…

Yeah, I guess I could sleep a little right now. But I don’t want to bother you… And I drool a lot when I sleep.

**\[Slowly falls asleep\]** Of course, you already know that… Goddess, this is so embarrassing… What have you done to me? What spell did you use… to make me feel so peaceful when I'm with you? You must’ve slipped me one of your powders. That’s the only way I’d feel this peaceful around you... **\[Yawn\]** You should be ashamed… but I forgive you. I really don’t mind… You’re still my hostage. I won’t let you escape… So don’t even try… I know… all your tricks…

**\[Snores softly, slowly fading out\]**

**\[Yaaaaaawn\]**

**\*Softly smacks their lips with their tongue three times\***

Hmmm… Where am I? This isn’t… the dormitory.

**\*Fabric slightly stretches as they rise to sitting position\***

Definitely not the dormitory… So, it really happened? It wasn’t just a fever dream? **\[Pause\]** Oh boy, how did I end up in this mess?

Oh, you’re already up. But it wasn’t… **\[Yawn\]** It was more of a rhetorical question. I know perfectly why I ended up like this. It’s because it was too hard to let go of you yesterday. And sleeping against you was…

It was alright! Just alright! This makeshift bed isn’t exactly comfortable, but leaning against you made it tolerable. At best! Goddess, to think I made you sleep on this for more than a month. I really haven't paid much attention to your comfort, have I?

I’m sure “you’ve seen worse…” Let’s just assume that for everything, and move on. That should make life easier for the both of us.

Well, am I wrong?

That’s what I thought.

**\*Softly smacks their lips with their tongue two times\***

I’m so parched…

**\*Hand softly probes the paved ground\***

I need water…

“On the other side.” Thanks, Stray. I feel like a herd of dust bunnies spent the night jumping down my throat.

**\*Drinks a few sips\***

**\[Sighs in relief\]** So much better…

**\*Softly squeaks while stretching\***

My back is still a mess, but at least my throat doesn’t complain anymore. Have you been up for long? **\[Pause\]** It feels so weird, asking you something like that. Thinking I had a knife to your throat just a few hours ago… Still really sorry, by the way. In case you thought I forgot.

“An hour or so?” Why didn’t you wake me up? You didn’t have to wait for me to wake up on my own. Must have been pretty boring, just staying there in silence.

Well, yeah, I do think the extra hour of sleep was needed, but- And what do you mean, “Don’t make me say it?”

Ooooh… Right. You’ve been through worse. I already forgot about our little rule. Anyway. That’s enough. I should get up, and we can… discuss about what to do next?

**\*Fabric rustles as they get up\***

Right, eating. **\[Pause\]** Food. **\[Pause\]** I need food. We haven’t taken time to eat last night, have we? **\[Pause\]** Oh boy…

I’m not flustered. I just need a little time to adjust to… this. Whatever *this* is…

**\*Drags themself in a few tired steps\***

**\[Tired groan\]** Seriously… How did you manage so long without coffee?

**\*Wooden chair gently cracks\***

I would kill for some- **\[Soft gasp\]** No! I didn’t mean- I’m sorry. It was just a slip of the tongue. I didn’t want to imply I would actually- **\[Pause\]** Know what? I’ll stop talking. Yeah, I think that’s my best option, right now.

Why are you laughing now? Are you making fun of me? Come on, I just woke up. Spare me for at least a few minutes, please… What do we have here anyway… Let’s see… I could eat a horse, right now. But I guess beef will have to do. Could you pass me-

**\*Stray takes knife from the table\***

**\[Sharp gasp\]**

**\*Chair suddenly screeches against the paved floor\***

**\[A second to catch breath\]**

I- I just flinched, that’s all. I know you- **\[Pause\]** You won’t hurt me.

Stray, everything’s fine, I promise. It’s just I was expecting meat. Not a knife. That’s all.

I’ll need some time to adjust, yeah. But don’t worry. I’m a Crow, remember? Being adaptable is a basic skill.

Well, I’m not sure of what I am, right now. I don’t think I can still call myself a member of the Flock. I probably already seemed suspicious, given how badly I fumbled my ransom career, but missing curfew alone is enough to put me under close surveillance if I go back now.

**\*Loudly chews stiff dried meat\***

Yeah, curfew. The Guild’s rules are strict. Not much leeway. That’s why getting back to you without raising suspicion was so damn hard.

**\*Still chewing meat\***

Well, it’s not like you could join *my* family. We already talked about what they think about… you know what…

Yeah. That. **\[Pause\]** Let’s just say you aren’t very welcome in our walls. Even thieves need to create a semblance of respectability for themselves. Guess the easiest way is to find someone else to denigrate. Much easier than keeping higher standards, for sure.

**\*Fighting to chew dried meat\***

I don’t need the knife, thank you. I won’t let a piece of meat defeat me, no matter how tough it is.

**\*Obviously losing fight against the dried meat\***

Just- a few more chews, and that meat is done.

**\*Finally gulps the meat\***

What-

**\*Chokes on meat\***

**\*Frantically slaps the table a few time\***

**\[With a strangle voice\]** Thanks!

**\*Drinks hastily\***

**\*Puts cup on table\***

**\[Sighs in relief\]**

Stray! **\[Room for breathing\]** Next time, warn me before you call me cute!

Well… Feels nice, I guess…

If you must *really* know, you aren’t so bad yourself.

I wasn’t *eyeing you up*, back when I still thought I had the upper hand. And I was *certainly* not almost drooling. **\[Pause\]** You *wish* I was, don’t you? But no. I was just making sure you didn’t try anything stupid. Strictly professional surveillance. Nothing more.

That’s the version I’m sticking to, if you don’t mind. And give me that knife. I changed my mind. This meat doesn’t deserve that much attention.

**\*Stray passes knife\***

**\*Cuts stiff dried meat on wooden table while talking\***

By the way. Where is… You know. **\[Pause\]** The body?

You moved it to another corner of the tunnel? Good. I’m honestly relieved I didn’t have to wake up to that. Thanks.

I imagine it wasn’t exactly a pleasant way to start the day. And yes, I know what you’re going to say, doesn’t matter. We really need to get you out of that mindset if we’re ever going to… well, I don’t even know. A normal life feels like too much to hope for right now. I guess we’ll figure it out as we go. Unless you’ve got something more specific in mind?

**\*Stops cutting\***

**\*Chews a small piece of meat\***

Yeah, getting out of Cinderkhaim would probably be a good start. I don’t think staying here is an option anymore. But after that? I must admit, I have little knowledge of life outside of the capital. Except for little excursions like the one into the Cunnanbridds domain, I never really left this town. Not on my own anyway.

**\*Chews another small piece of meat\***

Well, I guess having the education of a blue-blood has its perks. I’m not saying it’s *better* than learning in the street, but I must admit you must have learnt *some* skills I didn’t.

**\*Chews another small piece of meat\***

Hey! I’m sure they’re *some* things I can do better than you! Just because you're probably better than me at my specialty doesn’t mean I’m totally useless.

**\*Chews another small piece of meat\***

I don’t even care about what you have to say. Let me just enjoy the feeling of my stomach finally stopping begging. Damn, that meat was tough. Were you only eating what I bring you there?

I guess even in the dark of the night, roaming in town would have been risky, yeah. Considering we’ve been found without you leaving this place… How did he even manage to find you?

Crows aren’t the only ones having eyes everywhere, huh? That sure doesn’t sound ominous at all…

“With the right bribe, everyone can be an informant.” So, even rumors about a Crow acting slightly out of character can reach your ears?

Still ominous. **\[Pause\]** Wait; do you mean another Crow betrayed me?!

Even if you can’t prove it, the fact you think it’s a possibility is enough for me. **\[Pause\]** And to think we’re supposed to be a family. But I guess everyone does their best to survive.

Yeah, that's not so far removed from me playing ransomer on the side, you're right. Just another kind of step out of line. Maybe a less stupid one, to be honest.

I’m not really sure. I still don’t know what to think of all of this. Is that really a good thing? I mean, sure, this is maybe the occasion I waited for so long. A chance to taste another life. Still, I can’t help feeling like we’ve got our backs against the wall. Not much wiggle room for us.

That’s the thing. I’m not even sure of what we are. I mean, we’re clearly not enemies anymore, but… I’ve never been this close to someone. And I think it scares me a little. Like I’m giving you the power to hurt me in a way no one else could. Not that I don’t trust you but… In fact, this *is* because I trust you.

Tsss… I waited so long for something to finally change, and here I am, still on the verge of chickening out. **\[Sighs\]** I really don’t understand why you would care about someone like me…

Well, this one is easy. Sure, it all started by you using me. But I did the same, so this point is void. What’s left is you listened to me. You comforted me when I needed it. **\[Pause\]** You didn’t even complain when I *accidently* starved you. And I guess, in a twisted way, you tried to protect me from your past… Even if this one kinda blown up in the end. And… **\[Muttering\]** you’re also kinda cute…

Don’t make me repeat myself! If you didn’t hear, that’s your loss. **\[Soft chuckle\]** But in the end, I think what matters the most is just how easy it is to talk to you. Like, I don’t have to pretend I’m always in full control of the situation. I’ve messed up plenty. But you never seem to think less of me.

Oh. Something else to confess to fully wipe the slate clean?

“About that story you told me.” You mean, when you found a… your maid, in your bedroom? I- Alright, I’m listening…

So, there wasn’t ever anyone else? She was sent to kill you, and you killed her first?

That’s… To be honest, I thought something was off with that story. But I brushed it off under the excuse of nervous fatigue. I really couldn’t have guess that you were… Well, what you are. But why your maid would have tried to- …do this?

Even if it’s just a hunch, that’s still… I mean, I trust your instinct. So, if you think it was a test from your family, you’re probably right. **\[Sighs\]** To think you had to grow up in such a ruthless environment. They really made you kill the person who practically raised you. I can’t even fathom how hard it must have been. Already fully trained to kill at such a young age…

“That was the first time you had to kill someone, and the last time you shed a tear.”

**\[Slowly breathes to regain composure\]**

You really shouldn’t have to- Nobody deserves this. But this ends now! You were right to risk it all for a chance to escape. And I’m ready to put my life on the scale too. No more being a tool. Whatever they told me, whatever they tried to feed me, I’m my own person.

I like the sound of it. I am the master of me! Yes. This is what I want. No matter the price.

I- **\[Pause\]** No, I’m not sure I could cross *that* line, if that’s what you mean. But-

**\[Sighs\]** You couldn't help but bring me back down to earth, could you?

Being grounded was often a matter of life or death for you, I get it. But I think that my tendency to want to fly too close to the sun could do you some good too. That might even be what you lack the most. And that could really be why I- Why *we* need each other. Each one bringing the other what they’re missing. That sounds like the best way to find a safe middle-ground.

“Oddly pragmatic, coming from me?” Well, this is just the proof I’m right. So now, it’s your turn to step out of your comfort zone. Do something simply because you want to, not because it will serve you.

**\[A silent beat\]**

**\*Chair softly cracks\***

Hey, why are you standing up?

What do you think you’re- **\[Soft gasp\]**

**\*Kiss tenderly as they speak\***

You really are-

But I won’t complain…

I think I like-

I like when you prove me right.

**\*Stop kissing after a few more beats\***

**\[Flustered chuckle\]**

Does it mean I’ll have to be the reasonable one here? Don’t make any mistake, I do like kissing you. *A lot.* But we shouldn’t waste… Well, that’s sure doesn’t feel like wasting time, but we’re still on the clock. We need to find a way to escape all this, before any of our *families* corner us.

Well, *I’m* afraid. I’m not as though as you, Stray. I’m a thief, not a fighter. I can throw a mean punch in a drunken brawl, but that’s the extend of it. If we’re caught, I won’t be of much use.

But I don’t *want* to rely on you like this. I would hate myself if you had to kill because of me. I know you *might* have to do it again, but can we at least *try* to avoid it?

Yes. This must remain a last resort thing. We’ll try to do things my way, okay? Vanishing without leaving a trace. Or a body.

Starting now. What’s done is done.

The thing is, as I see it, our options are pretty limited, right now. We don’t have much to start our escape. I don’t have much more than the clothes I’m wearing. And I can’t get back to the Flock to gather more things.

You mean that pouch I snatched from you while you were unconscious? Sure, it’s something, but I don’t think we’ll go that far with just this. That was a disappointing amount for a blue-blood’s pocket, I must say. No offense.

Why are you smiling now?

**\*Stray rummages through fabric\***

**\*Stray drops heavy pouch on wooden table\***

Where did you- I searched you! And this is a lot! How could I miss this?

“I didn't search you knowing who you really were.” Yeah, maybe. Thanks for trying to spare my thief's pride, I guess. Got anything else up your sleeve?

**\*Stray rummages through fabric, methodically putting pouches and gears on wooden table\***

How did you…? **\[Sighs\]** I don’t even know what to say. **\[Pause\]** And nothing you could say can save my pride now. I feel like I’m in front of an apothecary stand. I’m almost afraid to ask what half of these things are for.

So basically poison, ok.

Poison. Poison. Used that one, still poison. Definitely poison. Way too much poison. Do you… Is there anything else than poison on this table?

Yes, Stray, I can recognize lockpicks. But I already have some on me, so this isn’t much help either.

I didn’t want to sound pessimistic. I’m just a little bit concerned by the fact you have enough powders and vials to knock out a full garrison. And kill half of them.

“A possibility that had to be taken into account.” I’m not even sure if you’re pulling my leg or not, and at this point, I don't even bother asking. **\[Pause\]** What else do we have here? A small sewing set? To fix tears in your clothes?

“To fix tears in your skin.” You really have a talent to turn everything dire, you know that? Not that I blame you. It’s just that all of this paint a really depressing portrait of what your life has been so far.

I- Let's just continue our inventory for now… **\[Pause\]** Let’s see. A pocket mirror. Pretty useful for checking corners, got one too. Probably a lot less expensive than this one, but it does the job the same.

I’m not trying to… Okay, maybe I have a tiny bit of inferiority complex when I see all the equipment you have. It all looks so... professional. I'm used to working with second-hand gear. I think... I might be a little envious, yes. I just never thought about how, even in this line of work, being noble-born makes such a difference.

Yeah… Yes! You’re totally right. It only adds to my credit. Operating with such limited equipment. **\[Sighs\]** I can’t even tell if you really think so, or if it’s just some manipulation lessons that you put into practice. You *did* manipulate me a lot, back then, didn’t you? Playing the frightened lamb, when you were never out of control. Goddess, you even let me slap you in the face…

Oh, I know it’s ok. What I didn’t tell you is that I hurt my hand pretty bad doing that. I should have started suspecting something was off. A pretty face like yours, stiff as an oak? Pretty suspicious, yeah. And to think you let me comfort you right after. Bet you really enjoyed that, huh?

“You took no pleasure in lying to me.” Yeah, as if I would believe that. Can you tell me with a straight face you didn't like kissing me when I clung to you in cries?

Oh yeah? And why wouldn’t that count?

“Because that kiss wasn’t a lie.” I- I- **\[Tries to muffle squeak of embarrassment\]** Don’t say that kind of things with a straight face. I don’t know how to react to that kind of… I still need time to get used to this. Just a little more time. That’s all.

“We have… all the time in the world…”

**\[Bigger repressed squeak\]**

**\[Tries to keep control of their breath\]** Okay, okay… I really need you to tone down a bit, or I’m going to turn into a puddle from all the embarrassment. We should… We should focus. Right, focus. On what we’re going to do. **\[Slowly exhales\]** Was that all you kept on you?

Right. Of course you would have hidden blades in your boots.

“And a few darts in the seam of your cloak.” You really are a full-blown weapons rack with feet. I’m almost surprised you don’t also carry a canon behind your ear at this point.

“Fire weapons are loud, and the smell of powder sticks too long on the skin.” Goddess Stray… I was only joking, but you sure have everything figured out, don’t you?

Yeah, I imagine how failure in your work offers even less leeway than being caught *just* for stealing. But you won’t have to trouble yourself with that for much longer. We’re going to build a new life for the both of us. Who knows, maybe even finally settle on the good side of the law.

Well, I don’t really expect to become a model citizen either. But being able to walk in broad daylight without wondering if today is the day a rope will wrap around my neck would be a major improvement. And for now, I could just settle for being free from the leash of the guild.

Yeah… That would be nice...

**\[Kiss softly while talking\]**

One step at a time.

At your side…

**\[Soft kissing sound fades out\]**

**\*Soft echo of droplets dripping like a slow ticking clock fades away\***

**End of Chapter Five**

Alright, it’s finally time to leave that filthy sewer. You could definitely use some fresh air. \^\^  
But freedom? Can you really reach for it, when you’ve only ever lived in the shadows?

1mwt0f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1mwt0f7/im_annoyed_with_my_relatives_neurologist/,I’m annoyed with my relative’s neurologist.,"She/the relative is 76. She does not exercise at all. She smokes like a chimney. Her diet is horrible. She drinks coffee and diet coke like water. 

Her doctor has stated on her about quitting smoking. Exercising. Eating better. It goes in one ear and out the other. 

I have tried as I was serving as her caretaker. She has been having cognitive impairment off and on this year. Some times it has been worse than other times. She was admitted to the hospital and they couldn’t pinpoint the issue.

She has gone to this neurologist 3 times this year. He hasn’t been very helpful in doing more than an initial assessment - twice. He performed the same assessment twice. The 2nd time was after she had a severe cognitive decline. He actually helped her pass the assessment, so she could still drive. The 3rd visit was basically a waste of time.

He never once had talked to her about amyloid plaques and how smoking increases the production of this plaque and it can exacerbate the risk for Alzheimer’s. 

I am seeing it play out with how poorly her cognitive function is. Yet this doctor has done nothing but prescribe her a low dose of donepezil.

I have sent the doctor messages via the secure internal messaging system to alert him of some of her odd behaviors prior to the 3rd appointment. Yet he didn’t ask her more in-depth questions or do a deeper dive to try to gain more insight. Nothing.

He was sent her CT scan results prior to her 2nd appointment that the hospital performed as they were trying to pinpoint what was going on with her. They mentioned she had a lot of brain atrophy. Yet the neurologist mentioned nothing during the 2nd appointment.

What exactly is the neurologist supposed to be doing? It does not seem like her current one does anything more than just prescribe medication.",0,1755825202.0,AgingParents,15,0.5,False

Expert insights combining regulatory essentials, real-world shortcuts, and Bahrain’s unique business culture.\
\
\
The Reality of Doing Business in Bahrain\
I remember my first afternoon signing paperwork at the Bahrain Financial Harbour. The panoramic sea view from my lawyer’s office, coffee poured over dates, and the gentle hum of legal Arabic and English in the air. Yet, what stuck with me most was the quiet efficiency—documents stamped by noon, a majlis meeting in Seef District by three, and a handshake confirming everything by sunset. If you’re serious about Bahrain company formation, these moments matter more than any official brochure can say.\
\
Alt text: Professional business people discussing compliance around a meeting table., non-oil growth reached 5.6% in early 2025—outpacing most of the GCC region. The Diplomatic Area buzzes with fintech start-ups and family offices, while Bahrain Bay hosts international HQs drawn by pro-foreign-ownership policies.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district skyline and corporate towers. forecasts 6% GDP growth through 2026, bolstered by digital reforms and incentives for sustainable development.\
\
Importantly, Bahrain’s nimble response to global regulatory standards—like the 2025 rollout of enhanced ESG reporting—keeps it ahead of Saudi or UAE for transparency and ease of doing business.\
\
\
Business Structure & Registration: How Entity Type Affects Compliance\
Entity choice in Bahrain directly determines your annual compliance needs. Options include:\
\
With Limited Liability (WLL)\
Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC)\
Branches of foreign companies\
Single Person Companies (SPC)\
Free Zone establishments (Explore Bahrain free zones)\
\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a corporate setting., a local address (I recommend Diplomatic Area for best government access), and at least two directors. See Bahrain business types.\
2025 Regulatory Update\
As of January 2025, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) now requires digital submission of all annual filings through a streamlined Sijilat portal. This update cut my renewal time by half—no more queuing outside the MOICT at 10am sharp.\
\
Annual Compliance Requirements: The 2025 Checklist\
\
Surprisingly, the bulk of compliance can be prepared in a single Google Drive folder. Organization is everything.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation with paperwork and office workflow. Renewal\
\
Annual registration via Sijilat\
Fee: BHD 50–100, depending on activity\
Deadline: One year from initial CR date (Complete guide on CR)\
\
2. Annual General Meeting (AGM)\
\
Required for BSCs, optional for WLLs—but always wise for clear governance.\
Minutes must be kept in Arabic and English.\
In Seef District, I once hosted an AGM in a majlis during Ramadan hours (tip: serve traditional gahwa and coordinate with local business customs).\
\
3. Audited Financial Statements\
\
Mandatory for all companies\
Financial year-end reports must be audited by a MOICT-licensed auditor.\
Submission deadline: 3 months after fiscal year end.\
See Accounting & Bookkeeping tips.\
\
4. Economic Substance Return\
\
Applicable to relevant activities (holding company, distribution, service center, etc.)\
Online submission via Ministry portal each year.\
\
5. Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Declaration\
\
Required annually for transparency.\
Can be updated via Sijilat; keep data on shareholders and controllers handy.\
\
(Mistake I’ve seen: Many directors forget to update UBO when a shareholder changes—punishable by heavy fines. I now remind clients every March.)\
6. Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) Updates\
\
All expat visas and work permits must be renewed annually.\
Employee records must match with monthly “Wage Protection System” filings.\
\
7. Tax Declarations\
\
Bahrain has no corporate or personal income tax as of 2025.\
VAT: Applies to companies with taxable turnover >BHD 37,500.\
Quarterly or annual VAT filings via NBR (National Bureau for Revenue).\
\
8. Bahrain Chamber of Commerce & Industry (BCCI) Membership\
\
Annual renewal required for most business activities.\
Fee: Starting BHD 30 for SMEs.\
\
9. Municipal Fees & Contributions\
\
Office tenants pay a municipal tax—typically 10% of annual rent.\
Payable to the Capital Municipality; avoid late fees by paying through SADAD kiosks at Bahrain Bay.\

\

- Batch your applications if you manage multiple entities—Sijilat now offers bulk processing options.\
3. Accountant Selection\
\
Engage a local, MOICT-approved auditor in November, ahead of the January rush.\
I once waited until December and lost my preferred auditor; now I book by September.\
\
4. Best Office Locations\
\
Choose offices in Diplomatic Area for one-stop access to LMRA, MOICT, and most major banks.\
Ground floor units allow you to avoid elevator lines during peak government hours.\
Don’t overlook alliances with Bahraini PROs (public relations officers)—they can expedite paperwork with key ministries.\
\
5. Application Timing\
\
Sijilat’s system slows in April due to fiscal year-end filings. Schedule renewals two weeks before or after.\
During Ramadan, plan meetings after Iftar—decisions are made more quickly, and business relationships deepen.\
\
\
Typical Costs: Realistic Budgeting for Bahrain Compliance\
Find a cost breakdown here.\
\
CR Renewal: BHD 50–100\
BCCI Membership: BHD 30–200+\
Annual Audit: BHD 800–5,000 (varies by company size)\
VAT Declarations: From BHD 300 with accounting service\
Municipality Tax: 10% of rent (e.g., BHD 800/yr for a BHD 8,000 office)\
Professional Services: BHD 500–2,000 for annual compliance packages\
\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation with business regulations..\
\
For restricted activities (e.g., some professional services), 51–99% foreign ownership is possible with a Bahraini sponsor (details here).\
Local sponsorship options explained.\
\
\
And this is where Bahrain edges ahead of KSA or the UAE.\
In Dubai, a local service agent is mandatory for many categories; in Riyadh, license processing is notoriously slow. Bahrain, by contrast, completed my CR in less than a week thanks to EDB facilitation.\
\
\
Navigating Bahrain’s Unwritten Business Rules\
One tangent that always gets me—business networking. The formal compliance rules are clear, but the real power moves are made in the majlis or over coffee at Seef’s Al Abraaj Café. Inviting a ministry official to a post-Iftar coffee or arranging for a Tamkeen grant review during Ramadan can move your process along more quickly than any online portal refresh.\
\
I once faced a Sijilat technical freeze right before a CR deadline. Rather than wait, I called my contact at MOICT—after a respectful greeting and brief chat about football, my issue was resolved within the hour. Relationships matter in Bahrain business, sometimes more than process.\
\
\
2025 Policy Change: Enhanced Digital Transparency\
The landmark compliance update for 2025 is mandatory “e-Audit Trail” integration for all companies with BHD 250,000+ annual revenue. Effective 1 March 2025, this change—announced by MOICT and covered in Forbes Business—means:\
\
All accounting software must log audit trails\
Random e-audit spot checks conducted quarterly\
Stiff penalties for non-adoption (up to BHD 5,000 fine)\
\
My recommendation: Deploy a certified cloud accounting platform before January and train your team early. The transition is smoother if rolled out post-Ramadan, when staff bandwidth is higher.\
\
Support & Resources: Who Can Help?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, customer service and consultation in Bahrain.\
- EDB Bahrain: Official incentives, market entry support\
- Tamkeen: Subsidies for hiring, training, and digital upgrades\
- Licensed PROs: Efficient document handling, Arabic translation, and government follow-up\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi: A Practical Perspective\
Bahrain’s compliance environment is faster, more affordable, and less bureaucratic—especially for SMEs and tech ventures. Unlike Dubai’s expensive free zones or KSA’s high capital requirements, Bahrain companies can be started for under BHD 1,500 with direct access to 100% foreign ownership.\
\
However, Bahrain’s regulatory processes still favor those who combine digital submission with strong personal connections. Master both to thrive.\
\
\
FAQs: Bahrain Company Compliance Demystified\
1. How long does annual compliance take in Bahrain?\
With digital systems and organized documents, expect 1–2 days of active work per year for routine renewals and filings. If you use a professional compliance package, your involvement is reduced to a handful of digital signatures.\
2. What is the penalty for late filing?\
MOICT imposes late fees from BHD 100 upward for overdue CR renewal or financial statements. For repeated defaults, company operations can be frozen.\
3. Can a foreigner complete this process end-to-end remotely?\
Yes, since 2024, Bahrain enables end-to-end digital compliance via Sijilat. Expat owners can renew CRs, file VAT, and submit audited statements online. For licensed activities or certain approvals, local sponsors or PROs may still be required for in-person follow-up.\
4. Are free zone companies subject to the same compliance?\
Generally yes, but with relaxed capital requirements and unique incentives. Find the latest free zone details here.\
5. What’s the most common mistake new founders make?\
Missing the Economic Substance filing or failing to update UBO data after a share transfer—both carry severe penalties. Setup calendar reminders or use audit services that include compliance alerts.\
For a deeper dive into costs, entity types, and the full setup process, check KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation process.\
\
\
The key to Bahrain business compliance is blending digital focus with local relationships—embrace both, and the process is not only manageable but surprisingly rewarding.\

1mwsvep,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1mwsvep/which_color_do_i_choose/,Which color do I choose?,"Hi fellas!

I'm currently a owner of a MBP M2 Pro 16' Silver, i work with video editing and filmmaking on general, but sometimes, specially when I'm working away from home, i feel it being clunky and hard to put together on a coffee table or a standard desk, for example. So I've decided to get myself a 14' upgrade.

I chose the MBP M4 Pro 14' with 24gb and 1tb, but i'm still open minded about colors. I sure do love the Silver color and its contrast between the black keyboard and light-gray carcass, but since i'm getting a new one, it just feels OK to try something new :)

Since I live in Brazil, and getting myself a MBP here it's the same thing as buying a last-year Ford Fusion in uncle Sam's land, I just feel I cannot mischoose my hardware.

So I'd like to hear from you guys. Which MBP color do you guys own? What does it feels or looks like?",2,1755824808.0,macbookpro,1,1.0,False
