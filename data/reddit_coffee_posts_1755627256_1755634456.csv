1mutixo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1mutixo/memory_lane_has_been_unlocked/,Memory lane has been unlocked,"So ive been with my husband for 10 years, back story to this... so we went out to run errands and while out we ran in to an old friend of mine, we will call her E.. I met E in 2001 and we became the best of friends immediately.... girls night out, shopping, clubbing etc... then she met someone I was happy for her, the 3 of us always hung out... so about 3 years in to her relationship with him she started cheating on him, and I kept my mouth shut cuz of girl code and it wasnt my business to tell him..... so then she started cheating on him with guys that I had already slept with, and then one night im at her place im talking to her about my ex and how we wanted to work things out... I excused myself to the bathroom left my phone on the coffee table, and 2 weeks later we went to go clubbing and she dropped the bomb on me the night I was at her house, she told me when I went to the bathroom she went through my phone and got my ex's number and he was meeting up with us at the club.... so they where basically together at that point, while she had a man at home I was drunk off of doubles of tequila and whiskey, I was emotional and hurt cuz he blew me off a few days after she got his phone number... but I never thought in a million years she would do this to me, she broke it off with her other dude 2 years after being with my ex.... she was living back and forth between the two guys, her first dude knew that she was back and forth cuz of their lease to the apartment... and then 6 years with my ex he broke up with her, kicked her out of his place she packed up and moved out of state 

So flash forward 10 years later to 2 days ago, me and my husband had been out running errands and we decided to go to a restaurant at the beach... literally it's the restaurant, a small bike path then the sand.... so we are eating enjoying a beautiful day, and I hear my name being yelled out... she walks in through the exit door of the patio she basically sits with us and to catch up with me... then she starts rubbing my husband's hand while he was sitting next to me, now my husband is 6'3 350lbs, bald, tattooed, hes NOT disgustingly fat hes just big and solid... so when I saw that I got up and sat next to her, and I told her listen you already damaged me once and took me years to get over it... I still have trust issues with being friends with other women to be friends with them cuz of what you did to me, she tells me well our ex did it to you too... and I said true but a guy will be a guy and always stick his dick in to anything that he can, but I discovered that you basically brain washed your ex and my ex to hate me when you talked all that shit behind my back I was done with you, why do you think I didnt want to attend your going away dinner when you and my ex broke up... all I know is that you better stay away from me and my husband, dont you contact me, or my husband and if you ever run in to us again or him without me I will beat your ass again (night of the club I kicked her ass in the parking lot) 

So now she wont stop contacting me via social media, ive blocked her and she creates new accounts to contact me, idk what to do cuz she wont stop... she hasn't contacted my husband, and before anyone comments saying im not over my ex... it's not about my ex, it's about the betrayal she did, the lying, the back stabbing, the going behind my back to contact him... we saw each other as sister's, what she did felt worst then a break up ",1,1755634155.0,cheating_stories,1,1.0,False

Are we making decisions, or are we simply following a script? Could a possible answer be that both are happening?

We are taught that destiny is something fixed, something pre-written. But what if ""destiny"" is nothing more than the result of the free will decisions we made in a higher state of consciousness before coming here?

In an eternal plane, you decide you want to learn about compassion, loss, or unconditional love. To learn these lessons, you choose the people, situations, and challenges that will be presented to you in this life. Not because they are predetermined in every single detail, but because they are the best tools for you to experience what you came to experience...

Under this idea, your free will would not be whether you order coffee or tea in the morning, but the fundamental choice you made before being born. And life here, with all its surprises and challenges, is the manifestation of that contract you signed with yourself...

If this were true, would it mean that every painful or joyful experience is part of a plan that you yourself created? And would this completely change the way and/or perspective in which you see ""destiny"" or the purpose of your life?",2,1755634088.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

Now, I tried to get enough sleep and it did get better, but that's not the point. I've noticed that those day that I can't get enough sleep I no longer feel like there's dust in my head.

I've been friends with a person, let's call her Allie, since just before COVID. Allie found me through a friend's business where I hang out lots. We started chatting there and then hanging out in our spare time. Allie is a great person and she's the kind of person that goes 100% in on everything - kind of to the point where it comes off as she is trying too hard, people-pleasing etc. It's almost like she kinda morphs into what you like because she wants to be the best in your eyes. 

When I met her, Allie was seperating from her husband and was extremely vulnerable emotionally. At first I was kind of happy to be this great friend swooping in and saving the day, being a good shoulder to cry on and staying up late giving advice and support. Her romantic life was a bit of a trrainwreck and I thought I was being helpful by telling her to stay away from this toxic guy she had been essentially having a serious emotional affair with (while married). She eventually divorced her husband and got with this guy she had been chasing, who was gross and awful to her. Needless to say that didn't last very long - I helped her get out of that situation by introducing her to an acquaintance I had through my theatre community. They started dating immediately. Great, she's finally on the right track. Our friendship was great - we would hang out almost daily, I could see a positive change in her in this new relationship and things felt great. 

As she started getting more serious with the new guy, the morphing began. All of a sudden she changed her whole aesthetic and lifestyle. Now, she wants to be a trad wife with kids (when we were hanging out, we spoke often about being childfree forever), she went from wearing patagonia/outdoor lifestyle hiking stuff to long dresses and those hats that influencer girls wear. She changed her job - started working at a coffee shop closer to where her new guy works. She even mentioned that this dude wants to start going to church with her (she is completely and very vocally non-religious, and I had never heard him speak about religion or belonging to any type of church when we did shows together). All of these things gave me some big red flags.

Basically the new guy is a Joe Rogan bro who is looking for a tradwife, and because she is so eager to please, she is becoming this for him. I'm a gay guy and I really prefer not to have anything to do with that scene. Anyways, I've slowly just been distancing myself because it seems that we no longer have anything in common. Have only seen her briefly in passing at the local bar we first met in - she's been with her guy everytime, but we've said a few friendly hellos, had quick catch ups and then she was off. She reached out a couple of days ago and asked to meet for coffee and said that she misses me and our hangouts. I don't really know what to say. On one hand, I want to be honest and tell her that I don't recognize her anymore and she's not really the friend that I had, and that the friendship is essentially over. On the other hand, I also don't want to hurt her feelings or make her question her relationship. I don't like this dude at all but she seems to be happy and that's great for her; if I'm honest with her, she might take that too much to heart and self-sabatoge the whole thing. Really, I would just like her to forget about me so that I don't have to awkwardly make up excuses every time she wants to see me. Or maybe I'm just being too judgmental? I don't know. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. Friendships are hard. Thanks for listening. ",1,1755633875.0,RedditForGrownups,1,1.0,False

As the manager interviewed me she had told me she used to work for an office and wasn't happy there and got a job in the grocery store as the manager of the coffee shop. She had worked in a coffee chain that has recently grown to other states and came with the tricks from them and I had come from the other rival coffee chain and was going to use my knowledge of the recipes and how beverages are made with improvements to them, including some secret drinks, and barista made drinks that are made in improv.

1mutckk,https://i.redd.it/ckx8f5hl81kf1.jpeg,How to combine open kitchen with living and dining area,"Hello everybody,

We renovated our home recently and are in the progess to refurniture the living room. We don't really feel comfortable with the seeting/tv area and the dining area. The dining room is the empty room on the left btw. We feel like the dining area is to far from the kitchen and it doesn't feel 'cozy' to eat there with the family and friends. Like we are seated in some corner on the far etch of the room. Also the kitchen and dining area don't feel connected and there is no way to have conversasion with the person cooking and the person already seated at the dining table.

We still have the same furniture that we had before the renovation but are in the process of replacing the big pieces like the sofa, coffee table and dining table. What would your recomandations be for refurniture the space and make it more connected? We don't mind a smaller sofa and adding more armchairs for example.

For extra context:

We started with the first (most left) picture and I guess we stayed with it for the first 3 or 4 years. We switched to the second picture mostly because it gave us a better position to watch TV. We already used the dining room less and less and started to use the couch as the dining area. After 1 year we switched to the third picture and at first we really liked it. The window and sun behind us didn't make us feel uncomfortable but at the end something just felt off. We switch back to the second picture last week and like it so far. We are considering switching sofa's to try and use the 4th picture, in hopes it will gives us enough 'attention' for the dining area and tv.",1,1755633779.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

1muta0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1muta0z/evaluate_pipihua_beeswax_polish_for_wood/,Evaluate PIPIHUA Beeswax Polish for Wood Furniture Restoration,"The PIPIHUA Beeswax Polish and Conditioner is something I found myself turning to out of sheer frustration with the state of my wooden furniture. My dining table, ancient and dearly loved, looked like it might disintegrate into dust after years of neglect. This product came highly recommended, so I decided to give it a whirl. With its promise to rejuvenate wood surfaces while being non-toxic and eco-friendly, it sounded like it might just save my table‚Äîand my sanity.

**Natural Materials and Eco-Friendly Formula**  
I was immediately drawn to the fact that this product is made from natural beeswax and mineral oil. It's free from silicones, GMO ingredients, and paraffin, which made me feel good about using it in a home with kids and pets running around. The light scent of beeswax was pleasant rather than overwhelming, which felt like a bonus. I appreciated that it aligns well with environmentally friendly practices. No weird chemical smells, no worries about potential toxicity‚Äîjust a simple, natural solution. From the moment I twisted that lid off, I felt reassured about what I was about to spread all over my furniture.

**Ease of Application**  
Applying this beeswax polish was surprisingly straightforward. I started by cleaning the wooden surfaces thoroughly, which is apparently a critical step. My first attempt was on a wooden coffee table that had seen one too many spills. Using a soft cloth, I applied a small amount of the wax in circular motions. The texture was smooth and spread easily, leaving a thin and even coat. After 15 minutes, I buffed off the excess using a clean rag. The result? The table didn‚Äôt just get a shine‚Äîit looked alive again! The instructions were easy to follow, even for someone like me, who usually hates lengthy how-to steps.

**Furniture Restoration Game-Changer**  
This polish doesn‚Äôt just add a cosmetic shine; it genuinely restored the surface of my older furniture. I had completely forgotten how beautiful the natural grain of my dining table could be. Years of grime, scratches, and neglect seemed to vanish, replaced by what looked like brand-new wood. It also seems to add a protective layer, as liquids now bead up instead of seeping into the wood. I tested it out on an old cabinet as well, which had water rings from forgotten mugs. The beeswax actually made most of the lighter marks fade into the background. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs pretty close.

[Check PIPIHUA Beeswax Polish and Conditioner for Wood Furniture price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0by51d318/)  

**Versatility Across Different Surfaces**  
One of the most appealing features is how versatile this product is. I didn‚Äôt restrict its use to just furniture. It worked wonders on my wooden staircase, which constantly takes a beating from shoes and sheer foot traffic. I even tried it on a wooden chopping block (disclaimer: the product is food-safe but not edible!), though I was initially hesitant. It lent the block a visually smoother finish and seemed to regenerate the dry and dull wood. From cabinets and doors to unfinished craft projects, this product delivered consistent results across surfaces.

**Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ Non-toxic and safe for a home with kids and pets  
‚Ä¢ Revives both old and new furniture surfaces  
‚Ä¢ Forms a long-lasting protective layer against dirt and liquids  

**Negatives**  
‚Ä¢ Takes a full 24 hours for optimal drying, so patience is needed  
‚Ä¢ Soft wood surfaces may require multiple layers for deeper conditioning  
‚Ä¢ Frequent dusting may still be necessary as the polished finish attracts particles  

**Product Rivals**  
I‚Äôve tried other furniture polishes in the past, some of which promised miraculous results but delivered little more than temporary gloss. Brands like Old English and Howard Restor-A-Finish come to mind. While these work adequately, I found the PIPIHUA Beeswax Polish to be far more effective for deeper restoration. The protective film it created was noticeably more resilient, and I loved that it works equally well on treated and untreated wood. The all-natural composition is also a standout feature compared to the sometimes heavily synthetic options offered by competitors. That said, for quick touch-ups, some rival products might have the edge since they don‚Äôt require such an extensive drying process.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given the transformative results it delivers and its multi-purpose functionality, I‚Äôd say this beeswax polish offers exceptional value for money. It might not be the cheapest option out there, but the quality of its performance makes it worth every penny. Restoring your furniture rather than replacing it can save you a small fortune, and this polish genuinely accomplishes that task. Its generous size (16.23 fl oz) means it lasts a long time, even with regular use across various wood surfaces.

1mut9zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BezzeraEspresso/comments/1mut9zh/my_duo_de_arrived_any_recommendations_on_coffee/,My DUO DE arrived! Any recommendations on coffee beans and recipe for my first tries?,"Hi,
My Duo DE arrived today, and grinder (Timemore 078s) coming in the next few days.  Does anyone have any bean recommendations and a recipe for what works well for you that I can use as a starting point?
Can anyone recommend any of the beans from this site - it‚Äôs where I bought the Duo from and they‚Äôve given me a ¬£50 voucher that I thought I would use to fund me learning to pull shots and seasoning my grinder:
https://www.coffeefriend.co.uk/c/coffee/coffee-for-espresso-machine/?coffee_type=atrtrm_coffee_beans

Ideally I‚Äôd like a recommendation on:
- Beans
- bean weight : liquid output ratio (the double shot basket that came with the machine says it‚Äôs designed for 20g)
- extraction time
- extraction pressure peak?

I assume using those as a target will help me find the right grinder setting, I can then fine tune according to my (uneducated) palette. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?

Thanks!

1mut963,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1mut963/explore_how_well_lanbeide_fs01_leather/,Explore How Well LANBEIDE FS01 Leather Conditioner Restores Sofas,"The LANBEIDE FS01 furniture salve felt like a game changer from the moment I opened the package. As someone who has dealt with countless scuffs and faded spots on my leather couch and antique wooden furniture, I was eager to put this product to the test. The brush and towel included in the set immediately gave it a professional touch, and I‚Äôll admit, I had high hopes that this could become my go-to solution for restoring old, tired surfaces.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
Everything about this product screams simplicity and practicality. The compact jar is well-sealed, and the included high-quality boar bristle brush is a small but mighty tool. The brush's sturdy yet gentle bristles coated the solution evenly without scratching delicate surfaces. Honestly, I was expecting the towel to feel cheap (it‚Äôs a common issue with bundled products like this), but it was surprisingly soft and absorbent. Having all the tools in one box saved me the hassle of scavenging through my cabinet for extras‚Äîalways a win in my book!

**Effortless Restoration Made Simple**  
This leather salve truly delivers on the promise of an easy, one-step restoration process. I first tested it on my scuffed-up leather couch. With a minimal dab of the salve on the brush, I worked in small circular motions, as suggested. It immediately started reviving the surface. After wiping off the excess with the towel, my couch looked like it belonged in a showroom. I even tried it on my wooden coffee table, which had water rings I‚Äôd long given up on. Without needing to sand or stain, the finish was vibrant and smooth. Effortless barely scratches the surface when it comes to describing how easy it is to use.

Check [LANBEIDE FS01](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0f23xbs3k/) price on Amazon.

**Safe and Pet-Friendly Formula**  
One of my primary concerns was whether this furniture salve would be safe to use around my pets. My elderly Labrador, Max, has a tendency to sniff everything new in the house. Knowing this salve is made with non-toxic, natural ingredients like beeswax, carnauba wax, and plant oils put my mind at ease. I don‚Äôt have to worry about harmful chemicals lingering on my furniture, and it even has a subtle, pleasant smell rather than the strong, artificial scent I‚Äôve encountered with other products.

**Strong Points**  
‚Ä¢ Easy, one-step application suitable for beginners.  
‚Ä¢ Comes with a brush and towel for a complete restoration experience.  
‚Ä¢ Non-toxic and pet-friendly formula for worry-free use.  
‚Ä¢ Works on multiple surfaces, including leather, wood, and vinyl.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
‚Ä¢ The jar may feel slightly small for larger restoration projects.  
‚Ä¢ For older and deeply ingrained damage, multiple applications are necessary.  
‚Ä¢ Doesn‚Äôt provide a glossy finish, so those looking for high-shine results may need additional products.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to some other brands on the market, like Weiman Leather Conditioner or Howard Feed-N-Wax, this product holds its own quite well. While Weiman is great for conditioning, it doesn‚Äôt handle minor scratches as effectively as this salve does. Similarly, while Howard Feed-N-Wax excels in providing a glossy finish for wood, it falls short in catering to multiple surfaces like leather and vinyl. The LANBEIDE FS01 sets itself apart with its versatility and all-in-one approach, even if it doesn't have the sheen-enhancing power Howard offers. Just be mindful that the salve requires repeat coats for heavily worn areas, something competitors sometimes manage with stronger formulas.

**Value for Price**  
This leather restorer offers a balance between affordability and effectiveness. It‚Äôs rare to find a product in this category that includes the necessary tools, doesn‚Äôt take up too much shelf space, and is pet-safe. While the jar might seem modest in size, a little goes a long way with the rich and concentrated formula. Larger furniture may require more frequent repurchases, but given the professional finish it produces, it feels worth every penny. Also, the variety of surfaces it can tackle‚Äîleather, wood, vinyl, etc.‚Äîmakes it far more versatile than picking up multiple specialized products.

1musyrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1musyrv/explore_if_basbyt_water_stain_remover_truly/,Explore If BASBYT Water Stain Remover Truly Eliminates Tough Stains,"After testing the BASBYT WSR40, I must admit, this product surprised me with its effectiveness. Life throws plenty of messes at us, and having a trustworthy stain remover can be a lifesaver. Over the last month, I‚Äôve put the BASBYT cleaner through its paces in various scenarios‚Äîboth at home and during those ‚Äúoops, I spilled coffee again‚Äù moments at work. While the Water Stain REMVR 40OZ achieved some excellent results, there are a few caveats to consider.  

**Overall Performance on Stubborn Stains**  

Stubborn stains usually make me roll my eyes, anticipating hours of scrubbing. The BASBYT water stain remover gave me new hope. From coffee stains on my white kitchen counters to some unsightly rust marks on the bathroom faucet, it worked remarkably well. Its professional-strength formulation seems to tackle a variety of surfaces, not just glass or metal. It even managed to revive a baking pan that I thought was beyond salvation after a recipe experiment turned into a burned mess. Still, I noticed it took a second application for challenging mineral deposits to vanish completely.  

**Ready to snag BASBYT WSR40? See Amazon‚Äôs price.**  

**Designed for Versatility**  

The scope of applications this product offers is vast, and I found this versatility incredibly handy. It doesn‚Äôt just clean surfaces like windows, cookware, and sinks‚Äîit can also be used for boats, jet skis, and even RVs. While I don‚Äôt own marine equipment to test that claim, the thought alone expands possibilities. I particularly loved how it handled tree sap and paint overspray on my outdoor furniture. Additionally, its minty fresh scent made the cleaning process more bearable‚Äîno harsh chemical smells burning my nose, unlike other products I've tried.  

**Good Points**  
- The biodegradable formula is safer compared to others on the market.  
- It cleans and seals simultaneously, offering future stain resistance.  
- Works on glass, metals, and stones alike.  
- The minty scent keeps it from being too overwhelming.  

**While It Excels, It Has Flaws**  

Before anyone rushes out to grab this, know that it isn‚Äôt perfect. Nothing ever is, right? I noticed that extremely tough stains‚Äîlike really old coffee or permanent wine blotches on porous tabletops‚Äîtook more effort compared to surfaces like stainless steel. Also, for those with delicate materials, you might want to patch-test before fully committing.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Some surfaces require repeated applications for optimal results.  
- Can be slightly abrasive on overly sensitive surfaces.  
- The bottle size could be more ergonomic for handling‚Äîit‚Äôs a little bulky.  

**How Does It Compare to Competitors?**  

I‚Äôve previously tried leading brands like Bar Keepers Friend and CLR. Compared to the BASBYT water stain remover, I'd say this product edges ahead in versatility but falls just slightly behind in concentrated stain-lifting speed. For glass cleaning, however, it seems to offer a shine unmatched by its rivals. On the other hand, some alternatives come with smaller, easier-to-handle packaging, which isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me but might matter to someone else.  

**Affordable Quality**  

Speaking of its value, the product feels worth investing in, especially considering its multi-purpose nature. I appreciated its long-lasting effect of preventing future staining, which essentially pays off over time when maintenance becomes much easier. It strikes a good balance for people who want one bottle to handle various cleaning tasks instead of cluttering their cupboards with five different products.

One morning in June, I sat at my desk, the computer screen's glare making my eyes ache.

It had been over a month since I quit my job. Back then, I confidently submitted my resignation, ready to embark on a new life as a freelancer. I fantasized about waking up to the aroma of coffee each day, freely managing my time, working on projects I loved, earning income while finding fulfillment.

But reality? Every day was trapped in an endless cycle of ""I'll do it tomorrow.""

My desk was cluttered with unfinished work: a blog article stuck after writing just the opening, client copy promised for delivery within a week still blank, half-completed skill courses gathering dust, and even simple tasks like replying to emails dragged on for three days.

https://preview.redd.it/uz8oke9b31kf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=275f292380cd3f119e81e793578dbc8c1056472f

""I'll definitely finish that copy today,"" I told myself‚Äîa phrase I'd repeated no fewer than twenty times.

I opened the document, cursor blinking on a blank page. I told myself to do some research first, but one link led to another, and before I knew it, I'd wandered off track. When I snapped back to reality, I was watching food videos.

Late at night, lying in bed reflecting on my day, I realized I had unprecedented freedom with my time, yet I was less productive than when I had a regular job.

Without colleagues pushing me, without clear deadlines, I was like a ship without an engine, drifting in the ocean of time.

Freedom had become a curse.

To break free from this state, I began searching for scientific time management methods.

During my research, I gradually realized a problem: traditional time management methods might be a false proposition for freelancers. Modern society is filled with distractions ( phones, games, social networks ) and for freelancers, time was never the scarce resource. What we lack isn't time, but attention and execution power.

More precisely, what we lack is the ability to do the right things at the right time.

After deep reflection, I discovered that the essence of time management is actually task management and attention management. So how should freelancers effectively manage these two aspects?

Next, I'll share the method I've been using during this period: a task and attention management system that helped me regain my work rhythm and achieve real results.

**How to Manage Tasks?**

If the essence of time management is task and attention management, then the essence of task management can be understood as the allocation of our energy and resources. What truly determines whether we can efficiently complete tasks is whether our goals are clear.

So the first thing I do every morning is break down today's work tasks. Generally, I approach task breakdown from these three perspectives:

**1. Design Level: Clarify Objectives**

Time management serves objectives. Without clear goals, all task arrangements will deviate from the main point. For example, if I want to ""prepare a travel guide for a September trip to Fukuoka,"" the real objective isn't the ""travel guide"" itself, but ""ensuring proper arrangements for transportation, accommodation, and activities to achieve a smooth and enjoyable travel experience.""

This directly guides our thinking and action, helping us grasp the core of the problem.

**2. Deployment Level: Break Down Tasks**

After clarifying objectives, break them down into specific executable items.

‚Ä¢Are the core elements of the trip determined? ‚Üí Check and confirm passport and visa validity; determine specific travel dates and total days; book round-trip flights to Fukuoka; book hotels in Fukuoka based on itinerary planning.

‚Ä¢How to arrange activities during the Fukuoka period? ‚Üí Collect information about major attractions and cuisine in Fukuoka and surrounding areas; create a rough framework for daily itineraries; book restaurants or attraction tickets that require advance reservations.

‚Ä¢What pre-trip items need preparation? ‚Üí Purchase or rent Japanese internet cards/mobile WiFi; exchange appropriate amounts of Japanese yen; organize and pack luggage (common medications, chargers, etc.).

**3. Execution Level: Determine Priorities**

Priorities aren't based on ""simple vs. difficult,"" but on ""whether it's essential.""

‚Ä¢¬†P1: Check and confirm passport and visa validity.

‚Ä¢¬†P1: Determine specific travel dates.

‚Ä¢¬†P1: Book round-trip flights.

‚Ä¢¬†P1: Book hotels.

‚Ä¢¬†P2: Create daily itinerary framework.

‚Ä¢¬†P2: Purchase internet cards/mobile WiFi.

‚Ä¢¬†P2: Exchange Japanese yen.

The clearer the objectives, the more precise the task breakdown, the clearer the priorities. Only then can we work purposefully. Otherwise, we're just ""completing tasks"" rather than ""achieving results.""

Seeing this, some might say: ""I understand the principles, but what I lack is execution power! And your task management method sounds quite complex.""

You're absolutely right. In practice, I also discovered that task management is much more difficult than imagined.

There are deep cognitive science reasons behind this. The book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" mentions that our brains naturally favor ""fast thinking."" When faced with tasks like ""write an article,"" the brain quickly gives a vague judgment of ""this is difficult"" and instinctively wants to avoid it.

Effective task management requires activating the ""slow thinking"" system: analyzing objectives, breaking down steps, setting priorities... This process itself is extremely cognitively demanding.

This creates a paradox: the methods we use to solve procrastination might be more difficult than the tasks we're trying to solve.

But the good news is, we live in the AI era. Those headache-inducing ""slow thinking"" tasks can now be handed over to AI.

**How to Use AI for Task Management?**

To make AI truly help us with task management, the key is making it understand our management logic. Relying solely on ChatGPT's pre-trained knowledge isn't enough: it might give generic advice that lacks specificity and practicality.

So I first ""taught"" ChatGPT my understanding of task management‚Äîthe ""Objective ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Priority"" methodology mentioned earlier.

Based on this approach, I designed a specialized task management agent.

**ask Management Assistant Prompt:**

||
||
|SQLYou are a task management assistant. Each time I input one or multiple tasks, please strictly follow these steps for output. If there are too many tasks, you can break them down and output in batches:**\[Step 1: Clarify Objectives\]**Analyze the tasks I input and clarify the real objectives behind them.If objectives are vague, try rewriting them as ""how to"" questions.**\[Step 2: Break Down Tasks\]**Transform objectives into 3-5 key questions.Then refine questions into executable actions (subtasks).**\[Step 3: Clarify Priorities\]**Use P1 (must do, objective cannot be achieved without it)Use P2 (should do, will improve results but not decisive)Output task list arranged by priority.**\[Step 4: Execution Suggestions\]**Recommend execution orderProvide brief suggestions for time/tools/considerationsüìå **Example Dialogue****Input:**I need to write a PPT.**Agent Output:****Step 1: Clarify Objectives**Task: ""Write PPT""Underlying objective: How can this PPT help us close deals with clients?**Step 2: Break Down Tasks**Questions ‚Üí Actions:How should the PPT demonstrate product value? ‚Üí Organize product value points + collect case studiesHow should the PPT prove clients need this value? ‚Üí Research client pain points + match solutionsHow should the PPT demonstrate ROI? ‚Üí Calculate simple ROI dataHow should the PPT maintain professionalism? ‚Üí Collect materials, beautify layout**Step 3: Determine Priorities**P1: Organize product value points + collect case studiesP1: Research client pain points + match solutionsP2: Calculate ROI dataP2: Collect materials, beautify layout**Step 4: Execution Suggestions**Execution order: Complete P1 tasks first ‚Üí Then supplement P2 tasksTool suggestions: Use task tracking apps for monitoring, MindNode for breakdown diagrams, PPT/Keynote for outputTime suggestions: Set a deadline for the overall task to avoid infinite polishingAfter understanding the work content, please reply: ""Understood. I'm ready to serve as your task breakdown assistant. Please input the tasks you need broken down at any time.""|

The Fukuoka travel case above was actually the practical result of using this prompt. Although the example content was about guide writing, this prompt can easily handle complex tasks as well.

**How to Better Enter Flow State?**

After solving the task management problem, the next challenge is: how to enter and maintain a focused flow state.

Before using the AI task management system, I relied on the Pomodoro Technique ( 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of rest ). This method works well for handling trivial tasks, but for work requiring deep thinking, 25 minutes is simply too short. Often, just as I was getting into the zone, forced breaks would interrupt my train of thought.

I also tried extending focus time to 45 minutes, but found that longer periods made me feel fatigued, actually reducing efficiency.

Through continuous exploration, I discovered a more scientific method‚Äîthe Random Alert Focus Method.

**What is the Random Alert Focus Method?**

Simply put, it involves setting gentle alert sounds at random intervals (such as sometime within 3-5 minutes) during focused work. When the alert sounds, stop and close your eyes for 10 seconds of rest, then continue working. This can extend single focus sessions to 90 minutes or even longer.

This method has two important scientific foundations:

**First, the brain's ""replay"" mechanism.** Research published in *Cell Reports* in 2020 found that during brief rests, the brain reactivates recent neural activity patterns, performing ""replay."" This ""review"" speed is 10-20 times faster than actual learning! Just 10 seconds of micro-rest allows the brain to ""review"" recent content several times.

**Second, the ""variable ratio reinforcement"" psychological mechanism.** Uncertain reward timing keeps the brain in an anticipatory state. When you know there will be an alert within 3-5 minutes but don't know the exact time, this uncertainty actually enhances focus. Each alert feels like receiving a small reward.

Based on this principle, I now primarily use [FlowPing](https://flowping.app). Its setup is simple: 90-minute adjustable focus cycles, random 3-5 minute intervals triggering 10-second micro-rests, followed by 20-minute major breaks.

Focus time, random alert intervals, micro-rests, and major breaks can all be adjusted according to our habits.

Compared to the Pomodoro Technique's 25-minute forced interruptions, 90 minutes of deep focus makes it easier for me to enter flow state. If you're also looking for better focus methods, give this tool a try.

**From Curse to Blessing**

Time returns to the present, the same morning scene with me sitting at my desk, computer screen still glowing. But this time is different: my desktop is neat and organized, today's task list has been methodically broken down by my AI assistant, and FlowPing is quietly waiting to begin a new focus cycle.

From that June plagued by procrastination to now, my freelance journey has been flourishing. Not only have I completed self-taught programming from scratch, but my first product has also successfully launched. Every day is busy yet fulfilling. I'm no longer that rudderless ship drifting in the ocean of time.

Looking back, the key to change wasn't some profound time management theory, but two simple yet effective tools:

‚Ä¢**AI Task Management Assistant**: Transforms complex objectives into executable checklists, freeing the brain from the burden of slow thinking;

‚Ä¢**FlowPing**: Uses scientific methods to enter flow state, making focus an enjoyable experience.

Freedom, it turns out, isn't a curse but an ability that needs to be mastered. When we have the right tools and methods, freedom becomes the greatest blessing: we can work at our own pace, do what we truly love, and create our own value.

If you're also experiencing the struggles I once faced, if you're also searching for your own efficient work methods, give these two approaches a try. Perhaps they can also help you redefine the meaning of freedom, making each day more fulfilling and meaningful.",1,1755632014.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

Anyway, I figured I liked seeing him and I'd really want to get to know him more; the only problem being is when I am attracted to someone, I tend to avoid them, because I feel like otherwise I'm annoying them. My family said I should start talking to him more, but I felt that would be TOO OBVIOUS and people would notice the change. My dad even said I should playfully say ""Would you take me out for coffee sometime?""...respectfully, I do not think that's the way to do it. 

My attraction to him is NOT obsessive and it is not limerence. I understand that a man I like is probably just my made-up version of him. I also understand any kind of age-gap relationship would work if the two people have the same goals / similar stages in life they're going through, similar mindsets etc.   
But girls, he's a nerd, he is calm, when he speaks his words matter, he is very serious and monotone, but after a while you can see he's a gentle sweetheart. 

THE PROBLEM IS; I haven't seen him at the place for the past half a year. I have asked a friend about him who works there and he said he is ""taking a little break"". (probably busy with studies or visiting the place on different days then I do). He doesn't have social media. I can't seem to let this go, I like having this little delusional ""crush"". 

\- Do I let it go? (If yes, how does one do it without the recurring question ""what if?"")

\- If I see him again, how does one start conversations without seeming ""out of nowhere""?",0,1755631991.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

1musgp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1musgp3/nightmare_bl_rotation_of_tests_are_normal_and/,"nightmare bl*** rotation of ""tests are normal"" and declining","First post here, apologies to mods if this breaks any rules. I am not necessarily asking for a diagnosis or any professional medical advice in particular, just a person seeking solidarity and similar lived experiences. I am currently waiting for my neurology appointment. I have sought medical treatment already in multitudes.

I am currently just wondering if anyone has any similar symptoms or experiences, and I am seeking relief advice or just any good information you could give me. I understand we all have limited energy, so no worries if this isn't something you can currently give.

I have had a physical decline for 3 years now. I am 22(m). I have been stuck in the nightmare of my test results are normal, and referrals I can't access, that get lost, or the specialist doesn't do anything that is particularly helpful.

recently, I ended up in the ER for the first time due to migraines. Over the past few years, small headaches slowly morphed into a monster. I have struggled with migraines lasting weeks. I have a lot of medical anxiety, and I am trans so I have experienced some severe medical discrimination. I am diagnosed with agoraphobia, and my insurance is very bad (america, unfortunately). So you can imagine it took a lot for me to finally go to the ER. I woke up, and I very suddenly was aware that I felt confused, disoriented. Couldn't walk well. I have an intense fear of stroke, unfortunately. Some sort of survival instinct kicked in and I was unable to figure out if I was dying, or if I was just anxious. This is the complete list of all of my symptoms (that I can remember) when I went to the ER;

Disorientation, unable to keep my thoughts in order.

Difficulty walking, vertigo.

My pain was all over, in my head. However, there was a feeling of swelling of the brain and spine. This pain was intense at the base of my neck and the base of my skull. It also was intense mid back, and it was extremely hot to the touch. Full body chills, Fever. Swelling. It hurt to breathe in my lower back, when I breathed in there was sharp pain in two parts of my spine.

Extreme sensitivity to light, especially natural light. I had aura, and my vision was made up of mostly pink and blue stripes (hard to describe).

My sense of smell and taste drastically changed as well. I was having my coffee in the morning, and I remember thinking I couldn't really smell it. I tried to give it a deeper smell, and then it smelled different than coffee and muted. I was disturbed, and worried about covid (I mask and am immunocompromised) but that was later ruled out. When I tasted it, it was much different. Hard to describe.

Then I began to taste and smell a specific thing. I unfortunately have no real way of describing it. Its like a taste, I am swallowing it, I smell it. It wasn't necessarily a ""burnt toast"" smell, but it was enough to freak me out. At that point, I contacted my family and said I wanted to go to the hospital. A few hours later my fiance arrived and took me, as I was not going alone as a trans person (iykyk).

They did what they could. Tested for stroke, aneurysm. Clear. Did two CT scans. No tumors. Blood looked normal. It gave me some peace of mind, but not really, because I have no answers. Went to PCP, got nurtec samples, worked okay, asked for more, its 800 a month with insurance. Got a referral to neurology. Went back, got propanolol. Not working, unfortunately.

At the hospital, they gave me the cocktail I had heard so much about. I have intense anxiety with IVs, but I was willing. Unfortunately, there was a medication in the cocktail that caused me to have a mental health episode. I won't go into details but it was unpleasant enough for me to not wish to try it ever again. When I described the incident to my PCP, she was frustrated on my behalf and said ""Due to your mental health diagnosis, they should have never given you that"" which was not fun to hear because it definitely traumatized me. Knowing it could have been avoided sucks. Im sure you know the feeling. I am also unable to take NSAIDS or really any type of typical OTC painkiller as it causes me to get extremely sick.

After the ER visit I have had extreme pain and worsening symptoms.

Now I am waiting a few months to get in with neurology. I saw today that the reviews for the facility are awful, which is causing me a lot of anxiety. I won't be going alone of course.

I know some of you have been to neurology, and I would really appreciate a comprehensive list of what to expect or at least what they did for you. As someone with agoraphobia, unknowns are terrifying. I know my experience may be different, but if you know of any like medical gaslighting to look out for I would really appreciate it. I also have a symptom of things smelling really intense and it making me nauseous, making it difficult to eat. It can happen randomly in the middle of meals. I was just wondering if you have noticed anything that has helped with that? I haven't been able to find a decent remedy for that problem.

Currently, I am in the waiting period of the American health system, and I would be a million times grateful to hear tips, tricks, similar stories, really anything. Thank you so much.",1,1755631851.0,ChronicPain,0,1.0,False

5310 NW 8th Ave

The setup is low key: a food truck parked next to CYM Coffee, on grass, next to a chain donut truck, ‚ÄúDonutNV‚Äù aka ‚Äúa middle aged tubby guy‚Äôs paradise.‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to think my burger reviews need categories, smash burgers via a window vs sit-down joint burgers feel like apples and oranges. In the window delivered smash category , DJ‚Äôs Cast Iron is tops.

Inside: lettuce, tomato, onion, house pickles, and the DJ‚Äôs sauce. I grilled the guy on the sauce: mayonnaise base LS plus ‚Äúsecret stuff.‚Äù He shrugged and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got a kick.‚Äù I saw the red flecks, I had a bite and whatever it is, that spicy little nudge takes it over the top. 

The bun‚Ä¶ beautiful. Burnt on both sides adding a smoky char that lends a unique note. The patty? Exactly what you want in a smashed burger: crispy edges, balanced seasoning (not too salty), deeply flavorful angus beef but not arm wrestling the other flavors for dominance. Everything‚Äôs in harmony.

I went with a single as I‚Äôve done for all these reviews and the meat packed serious flavor. I know they offer doubles and triples, and I‚Äôd bet a double might be an even more perfect burger. 

Again DJ‚Äôs Cast Iron is definitely the best smash burger I‚Äôve had in Gainesville and close to the best over all, so far. I‚Äôm eager to return for the double.",1,1755631800.0,u_SuperfamiliarWilsons,0,1.0,False

1musf8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1musf8s/delve_into_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Delve Into the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by CHULUX and See If It‚Äôs Worth It,"The CHULUX CL-CM24002 grabbed my attention because of its compact design and promise of a quick cup of coffee. As someone who juggles busy mornings with minimal counter space, I figured this slim single-serve coffee maker might be exactly what I needed. After a few weeks of daily use‚Äîand a bit of experimenting‚ÄîI‚Äôve got plenty to say about this pint-sized coffee machine.

**Compact and Perfect for Tight Spaces**  
Living in a small apartment, I‚Äôve always been on the hunt for appliances that don‚Äôt eat up all my kitchen real estate. This coffee maker is only 4 inches wide and amazingly lightweight, at about 2.6 pounds. It fits snugly in small corners of the countertop without looking cramped, and I even tucked it neatly into my RV kitchen during a recent trip. Its sleek black design adds a touch of sophistication, and although it‚Äôs small, it doesn‚Äôt feel fragile or cheap. 

[Check CHULUX CL-CM24002 price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0cvxq9bck/)  

**Intuitive One-Touch Brewing**  
I‚Äôm not a fan of overly complicated coffee machines with an overload of buttons. This CHULUX model keeps things delightfully simple with its one-touch brewing system. Pop in a K-pod (it‚Äôs compatible with both 1.0 and 2.0 pods), fill the water reservoir, and press start. That‚Äôs it. It brews consistently at around 190¬∞F and wraps up a fresh, hot cup in just about two minutes. I appreciated the auto-off feature, which kicks in after brewing to save energy. The time-saving aspect genuinely surprised me, especially when rushing to prepare for morning Zoom meetings.

**Tailored Brewing Size Options**  
Not everyone wants a huge mug of coffee every time, and the flexibility of choosing between 6 oz and 12 oz brew sizes has been a win for everyone in my household. I mostly stick to 8 oz, but my partner prefers maxing out the 12 oz capacity. The fill area is about 2 inches deep, which makes adding water super easy without spilling everywhere. The removable drip tray can be adjusted to accommodate different mug sizes, up to 7.3 inches tall for travel mugs. It‚Äôs an underrated detail, but essential for commuters like me who often brew and dash out the door.

**User-Friendly Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning coffee machines can be a chore, but the CHULUX keeps it simple here too. The removable drip tray efficiently catches any excess coffee, so cleaning my countertop has been a rarity. However, as suggested in the manual, I descale it monthly using vinegar to maintain optimal function. It‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs not built for areas above 4,000 feet in elevation due to performance concerns‚Äîthat‚Äôs something to remember if you live in a high-altitude region.

**Highlights**  
- Compact design ideal for apartments, RV kitchens, or dorms.  
- Compatible with most single-serve coffee pods, including K-Cup 1.0 & 2.0.  
- Adjustable drip tray to fit regular cups and larger travel mugs.  
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature.  

**Critiques**  
While I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed using this coffee maker, there are a few quirks to share:  
- It doesn‚Äôt particularly excel in serving high-altitude regions, which limits its versatility.  
- Water quality significantly impacts its performance; hard water tends to cause clogging unless regularly descaled.  
- There‚Äôs no multiple-cup brewing option, so it‚Äôs not suitable for larger gatherings.  

**Competing Products**  
While the CHULUX CL-CM24002 delivers convenience and efficiency, there are comparable products on the market you might consider. Keurig's K-Mini is a strong contender in the compact coffee maker category, offering similar one-touch brewing and a sleek design. However, the Keurig often comes at a steeper price and lacks the unique 4-hole needle for better coffee extraction that the CHULUX offers. On the other hand, Black+Decker's single-serve coffee maker provides a similar small footprint but can feel bulkier due to its design. The CHULUX beats both on portability and ease of use, hands down.

**Worth Every Penny**  
From a pricing perspective, the CHULUX delivers solid value. Its performance aligns well with its affordable price range, making it a budget-friendly option without compromising essential features. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a quick, hassle-free morning brew or a flexible option for an office or dorm, the balance of price and functionality feels spot on.

First let me tell you about the coffee i prefer. I am allergic to milk and so i mostly drink my coffee black, which is hot and iced Americano but is brewed with aeropress. I live where it‚Äôs hot for almost 10 out of 12 months. So i enjoy making iced coffee drinks with tonic, soda, coke and fruit juicesü•≤.
Okay so it started with SIF cause it was cheap. Then i was fascinated by Aeropress so got that. Then somehow i was convinced that pour over is best if one likes black coffee so got that also but didn‚Äôt buy any grinder, scale or kettle with pour over cause aeropress was very forgiving. But only 1 out of 10 cups were drinkable with pour over with out tools. 
Also i have clients and friends frequently at my office who would enjoy cappuccino. I want to retire my aeropress cause i like my microplastics from somewhere else.
Now you coffee snobs, i need your help in choosing one of the below options.

1) i have budget of 40-50k for new grinder, scale and espresso machine so i can buy that and make good iced as well as milk drinks. (I understand that my budget is tight for buying the above three things but i would be more than happy to have 6-7 out of 10 coffee on most days, so don‚Äôt really mind buying a Chinese machine)
2) buy scale, grinder and kettle and give v60 another try.
3) buy a moka pot, scale and grinder.

We extended the offer for them to come and stay with us that way they had a safe place to stay and they only have to give us a couple hundred a month to help with grocieries, bills, household needs etc. We had house rules put in place, no disrupting our household routine (we're very strict with it, we have a child 2m and it makes our days go by so much smoother), help with household tasks, and most importantly if they were to slip up on their sobriety to be honest with us so we can plan accordingly to help them get the further help and support they may need and to not bring alcohol into our home. We're all in recovery, but my partner and I have held strong for over 3 years on our sobriety. 

Well, at first things were going great, it felt like everything was going smoothly and having them in the mix was a great extra hand. But over the last month and a half things have taken a left turn. They've stopped helping with the household tasks and now I've been left to clean up after them, which normally wouldn't be a big deal but they leave food out, trash my kitchen and living area, they don't put their dishes in the sink and will just leave them on the couch. They leave half drank soda cans all over the damn place. I found a food container still full of food under my coffee table??? They've been extremely dodgey with giving us the $200 we've asked of them, but they go out everynight and dont come home until god knows when and will blow up our phones until we let them in, usually anywhere from 2a-6a(they always leave their house key at home) and it always wakes up the rest of the house. My partner and I both work early in the mornings and while my job is remote, it does make my son extremely cranky for the day because once he's up he's up and will not go back to sleep until early afternoon. Recently we've been finding empty alcohol containers around the house, we've brought it up a few times to them and they flat out lie to our face about it saying ""oh they aren't mine, maybe (partner/me) had a slip up"". But up until a couple days ago they had access to our vehicle, we had found empty containers(and used condoms) under the seats and found out they had been drinking and driving in our car. Its our only mode of transportation at the moment and we cannot afford an accident. They've been picking up sexual partners, drinking, and havinng relations with them IN OUR CAR.

I am at my wits end and want them to move out, I have no issue with lending a helping hand, but that offer only extends until I am completely disrespected and lied to in my own home. My partner on the other hand still thinks we're able to help and thinks I'm cruel for wanting to ""throw them out"". I am tired of hearing excuses for their behaviour on my partners end and i feel like having our friend stay with us is beggining to become a liability.

So you can imagine it took a lot for me to finally go to the ER. I woke up, and I very suddenly was aware that I felt confused, disoriented. Couldn't walk well. I have an intense fear of stroke, unfortunately. Some sort of survival instinct kicked in and I was unable to figure out if I was dying, or if I was just anxious. This is the complete list of all of my symptoms (that I can remember) when I went to the ER;

Disorientation, unable to keep my thoughts in order.

Difficulty walking, vertigo.

My pain was all over, in my head. However, there was a feeling of swelling of the brain and spine. This pain was intense at the base of my neck and the base of my skull. It also was intense mid back, and it was extremely hot to the touch. Full body chills, Fever. Swelling. It hurt to breathe in my lower back, when I breathed in there was sharp pain in two parts of my spine.

Extreme sensitivity to light, especially natural light. I had aura, and my vision was made up of mostly pink and blue stripes (hard to describe).

My sense of smell and taste drastically changed as well. I was having my coffee in the morning, and I remember thinking I couldn't really smell it. I tried to give it a deeper smell, and then it smelled different than coffee and muted. I was disturbed, and worried about covid (I mask and am immunocompromised) but that was later ruled out. When I tasted it, it was much different. Hard to describe.

Then I began to taste and smell a specific thing. I unfortunately have no real way of describing it. Its like a taste, I am swallowing it, I smell it. It wasn't necessarily a ""burnt toast"" smell, but it was enough to freak me out. At that point, I contacted my family and said I wanted to go to the hospital.  A few hours later my fiance arrived and took me, as I was not going alone as a trans person (iykyk).

They did what they could. Tested for stroke, aneurysm. Clear. Did two CT scans. No tumors. Blood looked normal. It gave me some peace of mind, but not really, because I have no answers. Went to PCP, got nurtec samples, worked okay, asked for more, its 800 a month with insurance. Got a referral to neurology.  Went back, got propanolol. Not working, unfortunately.

At the hospital, they gave me the cocktail I had heard so much about. I have intense anxiety with IVs, but I was willing. Unfortunately, there was a medication in the cocktail that caused me to have a mental health episode. I won't go into details but it was unpleasant enough for me to not wish to try it ever again. When I described the incident to my PCP, she was frustrated on my behalf and said ""Due to your mental health diagnosis, they should have never given you that"" which was not fun to hear because it definitely traumatized me. Knowing it could have been avoided sucks. Im sure you know the feeling. I am also unable to take NSAIDS or really any type of typical OTC painkiller as it causes me to get extremely sick.

After the ER visit I have had extreme pain and worsening symptoms. 

Now I am waiting a few months to get in with neurology. I saw today that the reviews for the facility are awful, which is causing me a lot of anxiety. I won't be going alone of course.

I know some of you have been to neurology, and I would really appreciate a comprehensive list of what to expect or at least what they did for you.  As someone with agoraphobia, unknowns are terrifying. I know my experience may be different, but if you know of any like medical gaslighting to look out for I would really appreciate it. I also have a symptom of things smelling really intense and it making me nauseous, making it difficult to eat. It can happen randomly in the middle of meals. I was just wondering if you have noticed anything that has helped with that? I haven't been able to find a decent remedy for that problem.

Currently, I am in the waiting period of the American health system, and I would be a million times grateful to hear tips, tricks, similar stories, really anything. Thank you so much.",3,1755631272.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

Police are investigating an alleged assault on a Jewish man in Leeds who reported a woman struck him with a metal pole and declared: ""This is because you're killing babies in Gaza.""

The incident is said to have occurred on Saturday afternoon as a pro-Palestine protest shut down part of the city centre.

The alleged victim, told the¬†*JC*¬†that the woman, whom he did not know, tore a flag off its pole and struck him with the hard baton-like object.

He claims she told him, ‚ÄúThis is because you're killing babies in Gaza‚Äù, before grabbing a hot cup of coffee out of his hand and throwing the contents over him.

Commenting on the alleged attack, he said: ""I didn't see it coming... she hit me for no reason at all.‚Äù

West Yorkshire Police said: ""Police are investigating a report of an assault without injury which is said to have occurred in Park Row, Leeds, at around 2.30pm on Saturday August 16.

""The matter has been recorded as a hate incident and inquiries are ongoing.""

Try to put him next to the coffee table with his toys on top, he will play with them for a few seconds before he realizes he‚Äôs standing and then gets upset again. If you try to sit him down on the ground feet first, he immediately draws his feet up.

Not the kind where she‚Äôs off getting fucked by some other guy , that‚Äôs not what does it for me. What really ruins me, in the best way, is when a girl knows I‚Äôm obsessed with her. She knows I‚Äôd drop everything just to be near her. And she keeps me right where she wants me that is, under her.

She knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing. The way she laughs, the way she leans in close, the way her shirt rides up just enough to flash skin , every move is deliberate. Every moment is a tease. She knows I‚Äôm starving for what‚Äôs between her thighs, and she‚Äôll never let me have it. That control? That power? It makes me want her even more.

I‚Äôd be her emotional support puppy. Helpless. Loyal. Pathetic in the way I‚Äôd do anything just to hear her call me her ‚Äúgood boy.‚Äù Carrying her bags. Paying for her coffee. Running little errands just to make her life easier, while I silently ache for her , locked in a cage she made me wear, throbbing, denied, forgotten.

I‚Äôm just her friend. Her best friend. The one who listens to her talk about her life, watches her stretch on the couch in tiny shorts, feels his breath catch when she climbs into bed in front of me like it means nothing. And it does mean nothing , because I‚Äôm nothing but her toy. Her pet. Her obedient little freak who craves every crumb of attention and knows he‚Äôll never be allowed to touch her.

I don‚Äôt even need sex anymore. I just need her. Her smile. Her scent. Her voice. Let me kneel at her feet while she scrolls through her phone, while she laughs at something I‚Äôll never understand, while I sit there aching to be used, aching just to matter.

Let her remind me I‚Äôll never be enough for her. That I‚Äôm not a man to her , just a thing. Something she owns. Something she keeps around because I make her life easier, and she likes the way I look when I‚Äôm desperate.",1,1755631043.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1mus13i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1mus13i/35_weeks_post_op_gee_whiz/,"3.5 weeks post op, gee whiz!","(Edited for clarity)

I have learned the hard way that recovery truly isn't linear, nor is it likely to be the same as anyone else. I am here to share my journey because I found myself feeling really frustrated that my body wasn't taking the ""right"" amount of time to heal. My laparoscopic hysterectomy was on 7/25, only kept my ovaries. They found a small bit of endometriosis that was not found on any of the pre op imaging during the surgery, and were able to remove all of it. It was validating to know that the extreme pain I've experienced was not something I was exaggerating about or making up, given that women are rarely taken seriously with regards to pain.

I didn't have it in me to shower until day 5, and didn't wash my hair until day 6. When I did shower, my partner was right outside the shower and helped me get out and back into bed. I am a real ""get shit done NOW"" person, and so to be thrown into a body that could only stand up for 10 minutes at a time, now increased to an hour, has been challenging. 

My partner had to fly back to where they live yesterday, and I'm zonked right now because I went through the pharmacy drive through and then drove down the block to buy coffee. I was going to drive fifteen minutes away to the craft store after coffee but my body said ""absolutely tf not"", and thankfully I've learned how to listen to that. My craft projects will have to wait. The fatigue is so real.

I expected to be back at work today, but my recovery has gone so slowly that at my 2wk post-op appointment I had to ask my FMLA be extended to 5 weeks, because I just get so fatigued after doing the smallest amount of things. I work in the legal field, and I still can't actually use my brain for long without getting completely exhausted. I am only reading books for 7th graders at this point, anything more intellectually involved has me in bed for the rest of the day.

My recovery MVP was my belly binder. I didn't realize the horrific feeling after the surgery was my guts flopping around, and this subreddit informed me of belly binders the morning after my surgery - thank you guys! I told my doctor about it and was told my uterus was so small (about the size of a fist, normal size) I shouldn't feel much in the way of gut flopping...yet I did. Get yourself a belly binder. I am still wobbly on my feet for long periods of time, so I'm using a cane for support when I have to walk anywhere.

My pain is minimal at this point and I am able to control it with ibuprofen. My panic attacks (I have panic disorder and cptsd) are more frequent and happen seemingly out of nowhere, and I'm working with my therapist and psych doc on that stuff. Some of my cptsd symptoms were activated by the pain of the surgery, but my symptoms are also healing because of the surgery.

Regarding sex: the first O I had was 3 weeks post op (I was cleared for outside stuff only), was so amazing that I immediately started sobbing and laughing at the same time with joy and relief. My partner was concerned at first but then joined in my tears of joy. The second time was a couple of days later, and it was so beautiful and wonderful, it felt like my brain was replaced with scrambled eggs. It's so incredible to not feel pain, and to not have my cptsd symptoms activated by action down below. Is this what it feels like to standard people out in the world? Amazing. I'm delighted to join this club.

Also, definitely ask for a picture of whatever you're having them remove after they remove it. My uterus, tubes, and cervix were overall normal appearing, but they were still wild and cool to see.",4,1755630895.0,hysterectomy,7,1.0,False

The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.5% ‚Äî its second-worst drop since April‚Äôs tariff shock ‚Äî led by a rout in Nvidia Corp. That pressure overwhelmed gains in over 300 S&P 500 names, exposing the fragility of an index propped up by megacap muscle. Home Depot Inc.‚Äôs results lifted big-box retailers, while Intel Corp. jumped as the US is ironing out the details of a deal for the US to take a 10% stake.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg
Tech stocks swoon.
Treasuries rose ahead of Jerome Powell‚Äôs Jackson Hole speech Friday, with traders firming up bets on a September cut. Ten-year yields  slid three basis points to 4.30%. S&P Global Ratings said revenues from tariffs will help soften the blow to the US‚Äôs fiscal health from tax cuts, enabling it to maintain its current credit grade. The crypto world was engulfed in the rout in riskier assets.

Positioning across US equity markets remains at elevated levels following a strong second-quarter reporting season, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists including Chris Montagu. Individual investors are likely to slow their torrid pace of stock buying in September before resuming later this year, said Scott Rubner at Citadel Securities.

‚ÄúIt is always easier when the markets are going up,‚Äù said Nicholas Bohnsack at Strategas. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to poke holes in the bull case; the path of least resistance is likely higher, but we find ourselves increasingly worried that traditional risk assets (stocks and bonds) appear priced to perfection.‚Äù

Options traders worrying about tech weakness after a torrid surge have been trying to protect themselves with ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù puts on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF, according Jeff Jacobson at 22V Research. A measure showing the difference between the cost of hedging against a sharp downturn and a smaller one is at an almost three-year high.

 
 
Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett said the rally that‚Äôs propelled the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks about 40% higher since April looks stretched. Hartnett has repeatedly warned of a bubble risk in US stocks this year.

The technology sector reclaimed its spot as the S&P 500‚Äôs top performer last quarter, helping indexes rise to all-time highs, noted Bret Kenwell at eToro. While valuations appear stretched, elevated growth expectations help justify prices, and AI enthusiasm as well as momentum can help keep tech in the driver seat, he said.

‚ÄúWhether money continues to flow into the ‚ÄòMagnificent Seven‚Äô leaders or rotate within the group, investors will likely look for tech‚Äôs continued leadership in the second half of 2025,‚Äù he noted.

 
 
Traders are also gearing up for Powell‚Äôs speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with the Treasury market seeing a quarter-point rate cut next month as virtually a lock and at least one more by year-end.

‚ÄúAs the market readies for Powell‚Äôs speech at Jackson Hole, we‚Äôll argue that the biggest risk for Treasuries is if the Fed chief chooses to throw cold water on the widely anticipated September rate cut,‚Äù said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets. 

While this is not Lyngen‚Äôs base-case scenario, he says the front-end of the curve is vulnerable to a correction if Powell doesn‚Äôt deliver on the degree of dovishness currently anticipated.

Investors are waiting to see if Powell affirms the market pricing ‚Äî or pushes back with a reminder that new data arriving before the next policy gathering could change the picture. They‚Äôre also looking for clues about the longer-run trajectory of Fed cuts into next year.

‚ÄúThe market is all but pricing in a certainty for rate cuts in September and we agree with the market‚Äôs expectations,‚Äù said Stephen Schwartz at Pioneer Financial. ‚ÄúRate cuts are warranted as financial conditions are too tight right now given the softening of the inflation data and the cracks we are starting to see in the labor market.‚Äù

 
 
A couple of weeks ago, when the latest jobs report revealed a slump in hiring, the case for lower rates appeared all but closed. Then came the sharpest spike in US wholesale prices in three years ‚Äì fuel for the concern about tariff-led inflation that‚Äôs kept Fed officials on hold so far this year.

While the recent inflation data has been volatile with some conflicting signals, Schwartz says there‚Äôs a market perception that the inflation surge from 2022 is behind us. 

‚ÄúWhile we expect some near-term volatility, we believe markets will continue to move past the inflation situation, and that the economy and the US consumer are strong enough to continue growing,‚Äù he said.

At Bank of America Corp., strategists including Mark Cabana and Meghan Swiber say they don‚Äôt think Powell will sound as dovish as the market expects.

‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs reaction function to recent stagflationary data will be key,‚Äù they noted. ‚ÄúWill he be spooked by jobs revisions or lean into the labor supply slowdown?‚Äù

In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman deflected when asked if she would be interested in leading the central bank as chair.

On the geopolitical front, President Donald Trump urged Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin and Ukraine‚Äôs Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine and encourages the two leaders to hold a bilateral summit.

‚ÄúWhile there‚Äôs a sense that the path to peace is at least slightly clearer, traders remain wary,‚Äù said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. ‚ÄúAnd rightly so ‚Äì the toughest conversations, namely over territory, still lie ahead.‚Äù

Title.

I'm strongly, *strongly* leaning towards ""yes"", but I wanted to hear from the hivemind.

The Volt on the left I've had for a while and is fully evolved (level 34), while the Volt on the right is a new catch and still a Grubbin at level 15. Obviously, the coffee production on the new one is FAR better. The main issue is the level of candy investment to get the other one up and the fact that it has no ingredient finding subskills.

As far as other coffee mons go, my Clodsire is ABA and my Aggron is ABB (neither level 60). Therefore, coffee currently isn't super easy to get (I basically have to run all three).

So, back to the issue: would you all say it's worth the candies for the sooner investment to get the one on the right to at least get it to 30? Would you say it's better to keep looking to find a better one and keep using the one on the left, no additional investment? Or use the one on the left and get it to 60?

Thanks in advance!!!

1murt4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1murt4t/i_am_done/,I AM DONE!,"So after about a 3 years working at a Target Starbucks, I‚Äôm finally moving on and starting my first ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù job next week.

Funny thing is, I never even meant to work there in the first place. When I applied I wanted to be one of the nerds in the back because I am a nerd and know a lot about computers and pretty much anything in the backside of target where they have all the electronics, I saw the option for Starbucks and thought, ‚Äúeh, why not, sounds funny another box to click.‚Äù Next thing I know, they put me at Starbucks. I even asked to go somewhere else, and they straight-up told me the only reason I was hired was because they were opening a new Starbucks in the facility!

At first, I was like: ‚ÄúWhat business does a 21-year-old straight guy who knows nothing about coffee have working at Starbucks?‚Äù But honestly? It turned into a really good experience. I ended up learning a ton, and I actually had a lot of fun with my coworkers. I also found myself in an environment I‚Äôd never been in before. I was definitely the minority as a straight white dude most of my coworkers were women , LGTBQ+ , and/or different ethnic backgrounds. It was eye-opening in the best way possible, and I learned a lot just by being around people who came from totally different walks of life. I‚Äôm genuinely thankful I got to work with them.

The thing that kept me going, though, was making small moments for customers. Every shift, I‚Äôd give someone a free drink, an upsize, or just throw in a little extra. Kind of like giving someone that ‚Äú11th nugget‚Äù we all loved getting as kids. was honestly amazed at how much coworkers cared and were like NO DONT DO THAT! But what do I care Starbucks/Target is LITERALLY a multi billion dollar companies. A free upgrade to a broke college kid, or an extra drink for someone who looked like they were having a bad day  those lil things could completely flip their mood. Starbucks even gave me an excuse straight from my regional manager she said always try to make the moment for the customer, trust me I always try to make the moment especially when another cute college girl came lol. 

Now, I‚Äôve finally landed a full-time job outside of food service, and it feels surreal. Leaving the fast food grind behind isn‚Äôt easy , it took me a a year and a half just because I had to work there and another year and a half of pushing to finally break out. But I did it.

So, to anyone still stuck in fast food: don‚Äôt give up. I know it can feel like you‚Äôre trapped, but if you keep working at it, you will eventually find something better. It took me longer than I expected, but it happened. And if it can happen for me, it can happen for you too. Stay motivated.

I have been dealing with insatiable hunger all day and severe food noise that has been quite literally crippling. As in for all intents and purposes I cannot function as a human being because of my hunger and food noise.

I woke up at around 4:30 am. This was after a bad night of sleep, I went to bed at 8 and was up about every 1-2 hours to pee until I finally got up at 4:30. Had my coffee and 1.5 liters water/electrolytes did my normal morning routine. Went to the gym at around 5:30 for a quick 5k run.
At that point I actually wasn't very hungry but knew it would be better to eat. I had the same breakfast I eat everyday, broccoli with 4 hard boiled eggs. Went to work at 8 but literally couldn't work because I was actually starving and again, couldn't function. All I could think about was having more eggs at home. Literally that was what just kept going through my head ""I need to leave here so I can buy more eggs for later. What am I going to eat later. If I leave I'm going to eat. What can I eat"" etc.

I'm a volunteer so was able to leave early, and I did after literally only an hour. And went back and bought and boiled more eggs. Made coffee. Went on a walk. Only lasted another hour or so before I had another meal, protein powder with nuts and milk and banana. Still couldn't focus. Still felt hungry. Went on another walk. Ended up buying more bananas because all I was thinking about was food and what I would eat.

Came home. Ate a fried egg and white rice. Tried to read but like I said, my mind won't focus. All I'm thinking of is food. I'm already at like 1800 calories for the day? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 120 lbs so that‚Äôs already close to maintenance. And like I said it's still only lunchtime. I'm going to go to the gym soon and I know it's going to make me even hungry.

He started yelling and telling me that he‚Äôs sick of my terrible attitude and that I suck and that I‚Äôm a fun suck. He kicked out cat across the room while yelling at me. 

Family vaca - ran out of vape and he said he was ready to go home. I said of course you are, which started a fight. He was yelling at me coming out of the water in front of the whole beach. I told him multiple times to stop yelling at me in front of everyone. He got super drunk and wanted to have sex. I said no because of the kids in the room. He kept going and I gave in but he was being super extra and then bit me. I wasn‚Äôt into it because of the kids and he told me I was garbage and that he was leaving the next day.  On our 2nd to last day, he was pushing for us to leave that night and I said no. He called me selfish and that I only cared about myself. 

First day after vacation - adamant that our 3 year old needed an extra day to rest and told me I was selfish as fuck.  3 year old went on to have a great day at school. 

Arguing with 10 year and I heard him scream at the top of his lungs at her. She ran upstairs crying immediately. I had to go tell him it was wrong and he tried to justify it. 

Was upset with 3 year old for not listening and used his body language and tone to try to intimidate him. I said it was wrong and he tried to justify it

I told him he needed to go inside to pick 10 year old up on Mondays instead of having her walk around outside at 9pm trying to find his car in downtown. He mocked me and said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Started arguing. 

He told me I needed to stop reminding him of the kids ages because it was pissing him off.

A self-proclaimed coffee addict, I‚Äôve used everything from high-end espresso machines to budget drip coffee makers. This one stands out for its sheer versatility, but let‚Äôs dive into the details so you know exactly what you're getting into with this beast of a machine.

**Brew Options for Days**  
I never thought I needed a coffee maker with the ability to handle both grounds and pods, but the Ninja CFP301 showed me the light. Whether I‚Äôm brewing for guests who prefer traditional grounds or just in the mood for a quick pod-based pick-me-up, this machine delivers. It features 13 brewing sizes, including five for grounds and four for pods, even allowing for full carafe brewing. And let‚Äôs not forget the four brew styles ‚Äì Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. The variety, I‚Äôll admit, has reignited my love for experimenting with coffee. Plus, having the option to brew a concentrate for fancy cappuccinos or lattes has helped me curb my caf√© splurging.  

[Check Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b08qzsn97z/)  

**User-Friendly Operation**  
One thing I look for in a coffee machine is ease of use. The CFP301‚Äôs interface is button-operated, which I found refreshingly simple. It‚Äôs intuitive even for non-techy folks like my mom, who tested it out one weekend and declared it ‚Äúfoolproof.‚Äù The included Ninja smart scoop and K-Cup pod adapter are small touches but super handy. And because I‚Äôm lazy when it comes to cleaning, the auto-cleaning function ensures maintenance won‚Äôt be a dealbreaker for anyone.  

**Speed and Efficiency**  
Mornings aren‚Äôt my strongest hours, but the CFP301 doesn‚Äôt waste time. It brews pods faster than my old Keurig ever managed, and that alone won me over. Whether I‚Äôm grabbing a quick cup before work or filling a carafe for brunch, there‚Äôs no frustrating wait time. I‚Äôve thrown pods of every type at it, and the machine hasn‚Äôt faltered once.  

**Built-in Frother: A Game Changer**  
This isn‚Äôt just a coffee maker; it‚Äôs the whole coffeehouse experience in one machine. The fold-away frother transforms milk and dairy-alternatives into luscious froth for cappuccinos and lattes. I‚Äôve used both oat milk and coconut milk with the frother, and the results were surprisingly great ‚Äì creamy, smooth, and just like what I‚Äôd get at a caf√©. It‚Äôs also removable, which makes cleaning a breeze.  

**The Multi-Position Reservoir Is Genius**  
Space is always a premium in my kitchen, so I can‚Äôt praise the CFP301‚Äôs 60-oz multi-position water reservoir enough. You can shift it to the side or back based on how your countertop is configured. While it might sound like a minor detail, it actually made a huge difference in optimizing space in my cramped setup. Oh, and refilling it? Super easy since it‚Äôs fully detachable.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Offers incredible versatility with 13 brewing sizes.  
- Takes both grounds and pods, fitting into any coffee-drinking lifestyle.  
- Produces rich concentrates for specialty drinks like lattes.  
- Built-in frother is a major perk for those who enjoy caf√©-style coffee.  

**Negatives**  
- The machine has a relatively large footprint at 9.13"" x 11.39"" x 15.54"", which takes up some counter space.  
- I noticed the machine gets noisy during the brewing process, especially with pods.  
- It takes a bit of trial and error to figure out the ratios for the ""Specialty Brew"" setting, a challenge for beginners like my sister.  

**Competing Brands**  
I‚Äôve had my fair share of other coffee machines too, which allows me to compare the CFP301 to its competitors. Keurig‚Äôs higher-end models are direct rivals here, especially with their pod-brewing capabilities, but Keurig lacks the dual-coffee option and specialty brew styles of the Ninja. Breville‚Äôs Barista Express, a personal favorite, delivers top-notch espresso but demands significantly more effort and skill to operate. On the other hand, the CFP301‚Äôs balance of simplicity and performance has it beating out the more budget-friendly options like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which feels rudimentary in comparison.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
While not the cheapest coffee maker out there, the CFP301 more than delivers on value. With its wide range of brew styles and convenience, it‚Äôs an investment that saves the cost of those daily coffee shop visits. The built-in extras, like the K-Cup adapter and smart scoop, make it feel like you‚Äôre getting a little more bang for your buck compared to similar products. Also, knowing I can use it for tea and instant soups with the independent hot water dispenser makes it a kitchen multitasker.

1murljc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1murljc/delve_into_how_arm_and_hammer_powder_detergent/,Delve Into How Arm and Hammer Powder Detergent Stacks Up,"The Arm & Hammer 06525 laundry detergent has become a staple in my weekly routine, and I‚Äôve put it to the test under all sorts of messy scenarios. Whether it‚Äôs muddy clothes from my child‚Äôs soccer practice, grease-stained dish rags from a weekend barbecue, or the usual mishmash of everyday laundry, this detergent promises a robust cleaning experience powered by OxiClean. With its fresh scent and claim to remove even the toughest stains, I was intrigued to see if the promises on the box held true after consistent use.

**Cleaning Power That Packs a Punch**

One of the standout features is definitely its cleaning performance. Combining the power of Arm & Hammer‚Äôs baking soda with America‚Äôs #1 stain fighter additive brand, OxiClean, this powder detergent tackles nearly anything tossed its way. In my personal experience, old coffee stains, grass marks, and even stubborn residues from spilled pasta sauce came out looking almost brand new. I washed my bulky winter coat on a whim, thinking it'd struggle with the thick material, but it handled that too without leaving any residual powder clumps or damp odor behind. Whether used on heavily soiled loads or standard washes, the results were impressive every single time.

**Ease of Use**

As someone who has juggled between liquid, pods, and powder detergents, I find this powder straightforward to use. It dissolves evenly in both cold and hot water settings, which is a point of convenience for me because I often run cold cycles to save energy. The scoop that comes along is intuitive‚Äîjust one level scoop is enough for a regular load. For extra-dirty clothes, I occasionally double the scoop. I‚Äôve used it successfully in both my traditional top-load washer and a HE (high efficiency) front-loader at my sister‚Äôs place, and the results remained consistent, which isn‚Äôt always the case with powdered detergents across different machines.

[Check Arm & Hammer 06525 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b005bxozac/)

**Scent and Freshness**

The fresh scent claims really deliver. Unlike heavily perfumed detergents that leave an artificial smell lingering for days, this one provides a clean, subtle aroma that makes the laundry feel ‚Äújust out of the dryer‚Äù fresh. This scent doesn‚Äôt overpower any fabric softeners or dryer treatments I use, which is a plus for a household obsessed with pleasantly light fragrances. My athletic gear, which often holds onto sweat odors, notably benefited from this detergent‚Äôs ability to neutralize and refresh stubborn smells.

**Positive Features**

- Powered by OxiClean for stain-fighting efficiency  
- Baking soda provides lasting freshness  
- Compatible with both standard and HE machines  
- Dissolves evenly in cold and hot water cycles  

**Drawbacks**

Like most products, it isn‚Äôt without its quirks. I‚Äôve noticed a couple of minor inconveniences during my use.  

- Powder detergent can sometimes lead to slight residue when overused, especially in large, extremely dense loads.  
- Packaging isn‚Äôt resealable, which made me resort to transferring it into an airtight container to keep it pristine.  

These aren‚Äôt deal-breakers, but they are worth noting for those venturing into powdered detergents for the first time.

**Packaging and Environmental Impact**

From a design perspective, the box does an excellent job of being informative without overloading you with unnecessary details. It's compact, lightweight for a 3.48-pound detergent, and fits easily on my laundry room shelf. However, the cardboard exterior doesn‚Äôt seal tightly once opened, so the powder stays fresher if you transfer it to another container.

The product is labeled biodegradable, which aligns with my attempts to choose more sustainable options where possible. While it might not tick every eco-friendly box out there, it‚Äôs a significant step up from alternatives containing non-biodegradable additives.

**Competing Products**

In comparison to liquid detergents like Tide and pods like Gain Flings, this powder stands out for its affordability and effectiveness per load. Tide is known for its premium pricing, and Gain caters to scent-driven buyers, but neither combines the stain-fighting power of OxiClean in this way. While pods are undeniably convenient, I‚Äôve often found myself disappointed with how poorly they dissolve in cold water. This product wins in versatility and performance across different washing machine types without the premium cost associated with its competitors.

That said, if you‚Äôre someone who prefers the ultra-convenience of pre-measured pods or prefers to avoid powders altogether due to potential messiness, you might not find this as appealing as other options on the shelf.

**Bang for the Buck**

One of my favorite aspects is how budget-friendly this detergent is without compromising on quality. It‚Äôs rare to find a product that combines effective cleaning, odor-neutralizing, and multi-functional use without digging too deep into your wallet. For families like mine that seem to battle mountains of laundry daily, the value this detergent offers becomes crystal clear. It‚Äôs not overpriced like some liquid detergents yet delivers results comparable to higher-end options.

I learned a lot about working in a kitchen and working in a fast paced environment. I‚Äôd love to start working as a barista, but I‚Äôm wondering if this is enough experience.
Most of the coffee shops in my area are franchises, and I‚Äôve applied to most of the Starbucks in my area without any word back. It‚Äôs a pretty populated area here though, so I don‚Äôt know if that plays into it.
I‚Äôd love to move into an area that has more indie coffee shops, where I could actually learn the craft.
So my questions are:
- Do you have any tips for breaking into the barista scene?
- Is it easier to get a barista job where there are more independent coffee shops?
- Is this enough experience or should I seek out more, and if so, what fields should I look at?
- Can you afford to live off of barista-ing, or is it more of a part-time passion?

1murgne,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1murgne/should_you_choose_the_best_wireless_earbuds/,Should You Choose the Best Wireless Earbuds Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus,"Testing the Samsung SM-R175NZKAXAR Galaxy Buds+ over the past few weeks has been an experience that exceeded my expectations in some areas and fell slightly short in others. As someone who commutes daily and frequently uses earbuds during workouts, I needed something versatile yet durable. These earbuds stood up to most challenges I threw at them, though they had a few quirks that I‚Äôll dig into.

**Design and Build Quality**

Their sleek, compact design is the first thing that caught my eye. The lightweight materials and smooth plastic finish give them a modern, premium look. The earbuds weigh almost nothing at 0.222 ounces per piece, which is a blessing for long listening sessions. They fit snugly in my ears, staying put even during high-intensity workouts, thanks to the multiple ear-tip sizes included. Oh, and the wireless charging case is as sturdy as it is small‚Äîperfect for tossing into a bag without worrying about scratches. However, the case‚Äôs glossy finish does seem to attract fingerprints like a magnet. 

[Check Samsung SM-R175NZKAXAR price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b083kvm9vw/)

**Audio Performance**

The sound quality of these earbuds has genuinely surprised me. The dual speakers produce balanced audio, with rich bass tones paired brilliantly with crisp highs. Listening to everything from podcasts to fast-paced playlists felt immersive. What sold me further is the Ambient Aware2 mode, which allows outside sounds in when needed. This is incredibly handy‚Äîwhether keeping an ear out for traffic during a jog or catching announcements at the airport. However, if the ear tips don‚Äôt fit properly, you might miss out on full sound isolation and could experience occasional drops in call clarity.

**Battery Life and Charging**

One of the highlights of the Galaxy Buds+ is undoubtedly the battery life. Samsung quotes 11 hours for the earbuds alone, and adding the wireless charging case boosts that to a total of 22 hours. In real-world use, these figures hold up. I managed an entire week of moderate use‚Äîcommuting and workouts included‚Äîbefore needing to recharge the case. The fast charging is also a lifesaver; just 3 minutes of charge gave me an hour of playback, a life-saver when I forgot to charge before heading out. That said, for such robust sound and battery performance, it takes a bit of patience since the case‚Äôs full recharge time is roughly 11 hours.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**

Pairing these earbuds with different devices was seamless. Bluetooth worked flawlessly with both Android and iOS devices, and I could customize the setup using the Galaxy Wearable app. I particularly liked tweaking the EQ settings to my liking. Call quality, aided by two external and one internal microphone, is rock solid. This feature proved invaluable during video meetings in noisy coffee shops. However, there‚Äôs no standout feature that optimizes these earbuds for other platforms or heavy gaming use, limiting their full potential in those areas.

**Upsides**

‚Ä¢ Stellar sound quality with adaptable Ambient Aware2 mode  
‚Ä¢ Exceptional battery life with quick charging  
‚Ä¢ Compact and ergonomic design, suitable for long hours  

**Areas for Improvement**

‚Ä¢ Charging case is a fingerprint magnet  
‚Ä¢ Limited optimization outside of Android/iOS ecosystems  

**Competing Products**

The Galaxy Buds+ occupies a crowded market, competing head-to-head with heavyweights like Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro and Jabra Elite 75t earbuds. Where they shine is battery life‚Äîfar outlasting the AirPods Pro in single-charge playtime. Additionally, the seamless Android connectivity makes them a better pick for Samsung phone users. However, AirPods Pro offer superior noise cancellation, while the Jabra alternatives deliver slightly better water resistance, appealing to hardcore fitness enthusiasts. The Galaxy Buds+ hit a sweet spot, though, with their balance of sound quality, compatibility, and price.

**Budget-Friendly**

When you compare their price against the range of features they offer, the Galaxy Buds+ feels like a steal for anyone seeking a well-rounded pair of wireless earbuds. The product isn‚Äôt positioned as a top-shelf luxury choice but delivers enough quality to outshine similarly priced competitors. If you're someone who values durability, decent noise isolation, and excellent call clarity without spending top dollar, these earbuds are worth every penny.

I'm really new to espresso making at home but I've watched hours of YouTube videos on dialing in. Hoffmann's full series among others. My understanding is that to slow down the pull you want to either grind finer or increase the dose. I am at max dose for the double shot filter so I'm trying to go finer. I am using medium roast beans that are a little under a month from roast date.

I am using an 18.5g dose and keep grinding finer in steps to try slowing down the pull. But I'm getting a yield of 37-40g in 20-22 seconds. Can't seem to get it closer to 30 seconds. The Barista Touch has a 1-30 grind setting, lower being finer. I started at 15 and have gone as low as 6-8 yet still get a 1:2 ratio in 20-22 seconds.

After extraction, the pucks look perfect. No breakage, no leftover water on top, etc.

The resulting espresso tastes fine in a latte, but the espresso itself tastes pretty bad. Kind of sour. Like it might be under extracted but I'm also not very experienced in tasting espresso. I do have fresher beans but they are a very light roast and I hesitate to jump into very light roast with espresso. I use light roast for regular coffee.

**Get yourself a $100 bill. Keep it in your pocket every single day.**

I know what you're thinking. ""That's it? That's the big secret technique?""

Stay with me. This isn't about the money itself‚Äîit's about rewiring decades of scarcity programming in your nervous system.

**Here's what you do:**

Throughout your day, touch that $100 bill in your pocket. Every time you do, visualize yourself spending it on something you want. Not the same thing every time‚Äîmix it up. Coffee, dinner, gas, groceries, a gift for someone you love.

But here's the key: Spend that same $100 bill multiple times per day in your mind.

Spend it 10 times? You just spent $1,000. Spend it 50 times? That's $5,000. Spend it 100 times in one day? You've just mentally handled $10,000.

**Why this works when other techniques don't:**

Most people have never felt truly comfortable spending money. Even when they have it, there's anxiety, guilt, or fear about letting it go. Your nervous system associates spending money with danger.

This exercise trains your body and mind to feel safe, even excited, about money flowing through your life. You're literally rewiring your relationship with spending and abundance.

After a few weeks of this, something shifts. You stop thinking about money as something you need to hoard and protect. You start feeling like someone who always has money available, someone who spends freely and confidently.

**The real magic:** When you truly feel like someone who always has money in their pocket‚Äîsomeone who can spend without fear or guilt‚Äîyou start making different decisions. You carry yourself differently. You speak differently. You show up differently.

And the universe responds to who you're being, not what you're wanting.

Try this for 30 days. That $100 investment in yourself might be the best money you ever spend.

I'm 28, female and currently living in Manchester city centre. I'm looking to buy my first flat solo, a bit further out. I'm not from here originally but familiar with Cheshire way - Altrincham, Wilmslow, Alderley... all the places I really like but can't afford lol. 

My max Budget is 180k but ideally I'd pay less. 1 or 2 bedrooms. Ideally over 500 sqft. 

I've been to some viewings that are in Heald Green/ just on the border very close to the train station - and I liked the area, it felt ""peaceful""??? but is there anything there other than houses? I also visited some in Sharston, but I didn't love it. There's a few near Sale at top end of my budget. 

Criteria: I'd like to be somewhere ""nice"" and safe, good transport links to Manchester City Centre. I'd also like some cute coffee shops or a nice high street within a 10 minute walk or so. 

  
I know my budget isn't huge, but I've seen some cute 1 and 2 beds around this price already, just not confident on location!

Contrast that with this morning, when I accidentally drank my entire coffee (yesterday I drank half and gave the rest to my husband to avoid problems), and I just about lost my shit. I felt like I'd just narrowly avoided getting hit by a car or falling off a cliff. Adrenaline just SPIKED so strong and I was hyperventilating to the point my face was going numb. I took half a klonopin and feel better, just shakey, and I'd like to know if anyone out there has had a similar experience. And yes, I'll be drinking decaf tomorrow.

I was suddenly yanked back into consciousness when the overwhelming smell of ammonia suddenly slapped my nose. I opened my eyes, but for the moment, all I could see was the numerous stars staring back at me from the sky. I don‚Äôt know if some of them were duplicates because of my blurred vision, or if my mind was playing tricks on me, but in that moment, they were the prettiest stars I‚Äôd ever seen. Finally, after my eyes decided to work and focus behind my glasses, I saw two figures standing over me. Slowly, their shapes became familiar. Victor was kneeling next to me and holding a small bottle of ammonia under my nose. On my right, Bronwyn was carefully helping me sit up from the spot I had woken up in.¬†



‚ÄúEasy, sweetheart. Don‚Äôt push yourself too hard.‚Äù Bronwyn gently told me as I sat up and looked around. Night had completely fallen over the Freakshow, but there were still plenty of people walking around. Several of them looked over to us, but for the most part, they were just here having a good time. Having a good time, without knowing how horrible everything here was. I looked back at Victor, who was slowly and carefully putting the cap back on the bottle of ammonia. Just a moment ago, I had watched him eat a possum like it had been nothing.¬†



‚ÄúCan you tell us what happened, Ben?‚Äù Bronwyn asked me. My heart was beating at a million miles an hour, and I could feel it in my ears. I looked at her and started slowly scooching away from her and Victor. My arm winced in pain, and I looked down to see the steaming, burnt mess staring back at me. Slowly, I looked back up at them, but my attention was quickly pulled to the little figure in the distance. I saw Chloe, standing at her post and happily making balloon animals for a customer.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what happened. I‚Äôm trying to get the fuck away from here!‚Äù I shouted at them, having finally broken. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. ‚ÄúI just saw that fucking thing in the box eat a child, and I just saw HIM eating a possum in an alleyway! I‚Äôm done with this fucking place!‚Äù I shouted at them, practically yanking on my hair. Bronwyn was caught off guard by my outburst, and she was visibly confused but what seemed to be my nonsensical rambling. Victor was still too busy trying to screw the cap back on the bottle to pay attention to me.¬†



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fucking take this anymore!‚Äù I screamed, bringing the attention of a few patrons my way. I stood up and started to try and find my way to the exit, hoping that I could somehow blend in with the crowd of customers. But after only a few steps, I became so lightheaded that I immediately collapsed back to the floor, landing on my charred arm and causing me to scream out in pain.¬†



‚ÄúOh dear, he must be delirious from the pain! Victor, help me take him to the medical tent.‚Äù Bronwynn‚Äôs voice was distorted in my head as I began to slip into unconsciousness from the sheer pain of landing on my arm. As I closed my eyes again, I felt myself be effortlessly lifted into the air. The next thing I knew, I was getting a slap across the cheek to wake me up. I awoke in a new location. The medical tent was simple enough and looked like a doctor‚Äôs checkup room. Even included were childlike posters on the wall that would be expected to be seen in a pediatric room. And soon, the culprit who had woken me made himself known.¬†



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky not to be dead.‚Äù Garibaldi scolded me as he hovered over me at my bedside. He was carefully examining my arm and showing the same amount of disdain as he usually did when I showed myself in his presence. ‚ÄúIf you were stupid enough to try and climb the fence, you‚Äôd have been fried beyond recognition. Nobody leaves the Freakshow, Benjamin.‚Äù He hissed at me, yanking on my arm slightly. I grunted in pain, but I tried not to give him the satisfaction of a scream. He continued to look at it before he reached a long arm over to a cabinet next to the bed.



‚ÄúWhen did you become a doctor?‚Äù I asked him through gritted teeth, while he held onto my arm with his long claws. He seemed to ignore my question as he looked around in the cabinet. Before pulling out a small red bottle from it. He placed the cork of the bottle in his mouth and yanked it out. Without a single word, he tipped the bottle over and allowed its contents to spill onto my arm. It began to sizzle and burn, and no amount of gritting could stop me from screaming out in horrible pain. I thought for sure he was melting my arm off.¬†



‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve been alive this long, you learn a few things here and there,‚Äù he told me, letting my arm go. I looked down at it, certain that I would be staring at a bloody stump, but instead I watched as the damaged skin on my arm began to heal itself slowly. But it didn‚Äôt heal my arm completely, it left many patches of burn and damaged skin behind. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done for tonight. Victor?‚Äù Garibaldi turned his head, nearly whipping me with his obnoxiously long white hair.¬†



Victor was staring at one of the posters, I think trying to read it, when he quickly turned to Garibaldi and saluted him. ‚ÄúTake Benjamin back to his room and watch him. Understood?‚Äù He let out a few clicks and chirps. Victor nodded again before walking over to me and beginning to stare at me with his cold glass eyes. I missed his button eyes, at least then, it didn‚Äôt feel like he was burning a hole into my soul. I slowly got out of the bed and stared at Garibaldi before wordlessly leaving and heading to my tent.¬†



When Victor and I made it to my room, I went to close the door on him, but he simply pushed it open and walked into my room. And as I took off my clown outfit, I saw that he was still staring at me. That was when I realized he was going to take Garibaldi‚Äôs order to ‚Äòwatch me‚Äô very seriously. I couldn‚Äôt help but sigh in annoyance as I simply climbed into bed and shut the lights off. Victor dutifully walked over to my bed and began to stare down at me.¬†



The night dragged on as Victor continued to stare down at me in my bed. I didn‚Äôt sleep at all. How could I when I had someone hovering over me and staring at me? I tossed and turned and tried to just imagine that he wasn‚Äôt there. But soon, I poked my head out from my blanket cocoon to see if he was still there. He was, but to my surprise, in the dark as my eyes adjusted. Victor appeared to be asleep. His eyes were closed, and his head was drooping down. I waited a few minutes to see if he might suddenly jolt himself awake and continue to stare at me. But he continued to silently snooze while standing next to my bed. Slowly, I got out of bed and carefully snuck past my sleeping sentinel.¬†



I was thankful that Victor had been so hellbent on following his orders to watch me that he‚Äôd forgotten to lock my door from the outside. Silently as I could in the dark, I exited my room and carefully closed the door behind me. While I had been lying in bed, having Victor staring at me, I had decided that it was time to plan the escape. I would not leave Chloe here to suffer as I had done. And after seeing what had happened to that poor kid that Kraft had eaten, I knew that it was time to plan our escape.¬†



In the pitch dark of the tent hallway, I made my way down to the room that Mathieu had. If anyone was going to help me escape, it was going to be him. Finally finding his room in the darkness, I carefully turned his doorknob and was happy to see that he hadn‚Äôt locked his door either. Pushing his door open, I carefully stepped in. I was surprised to see a small light coming from inside his room, but I quickly found its source. At the foot of Mathieu‚Äôs bed, the Aces were huddled up in what looked like a giant doggy bed. And on the wall next to them was a small nightlight that was giving them a small beam of light. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at them before carefully walking past them.¬†



‚ÄúMathieu?‚Äù I whispered to the sleeping French gargoyle. I gently shook his sleeping form, and he grumbled, rolling away from me and mumbling something in French. I shook him again, a little more forcibly, before he finally pulled off his sleeping mask and stared daggers at me.¬†



‚ÄúWhat in God‚Äôs name are you doing here?‚Äù he grumbled sleepily. Despite being angry at being woken up, he still talked in a whisper, I assumed so as not to wake the Aces. ‚ÄúBenny? What the hell do you want?‚Äù he mumbled, squinting at me in the darkness.¬†



‚ÄúI need your help. I can‚Äôt have Chloe going through what I went through. I need your help to help us escape.‚Äù I stared at his face in the dim glow. He stared back at me before sighing long and hard. After a moment of silence, he pulled his sleep mask back down and rolled over in bed.¬†



‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk more about it in the morning. Meet me in Abigail‚Äôs bakery. I‚Äôll bring Chloe.‚Äù He pulled his cover back over himself and shooed me away with his giant stone claw. I smiled at him and thanked him before heading back outside into the hallway, carefully and silently closing his door behind me. As I entered the hallway, I felt a sudden and deep foreboding feeling in my soul. I looked around in the dark hallway, wondering where this feeling was coming from. Shaking it off, I started walking back to my room. As I started walking to my room, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the air become heavier. It felt like every breath I was taking had to be sucked in through a clogged straw. I stopped for a moment before turning my head slightly to look behind me. As I did, I watched a creature crawling down the hallway in the opposite direction from where I was walking. I caught a glimpse of its silhouette, it had a long neck and what looked to be spider like legs.¬†



I suddenly realized why Victor guarded my room so much, and why he was ordered to watch me tonight. There was something in the corridors. It took everything in me not to start running, as I feared the creature would hear me and turn around to chase me. I instead began to carefully walk down the hallway as silently as I could, taking short, shallow breaths and freezing at every little noise that sprang up. My heart was pounding so hard I thought my sternum would break as I looked around the corridors. I had walked down these hallways plenty of times before, but now they all seemed to be blending together, and it felt like I was suddenly trapped inside a maze.¬†



As I rounded the corner that led down to my room, I suddenly heard what sounded like strange scuttling coming from the hallway behind me. I stopped in my tracks and slowly turned around to see what had made that noise. Behind me was a large shilouted creature shrouded in darkness. Two piercing white eyes stared back at me, with a long neck and giant spider limbs, with what looked like a dangling body from its limbs. I turned around and made a dead sprint to my room. I could hear it scuttling behind me and closing the distance between us.¬†



I reached my door and threw it open, before quickly slamming it behind me and locking it from my end. I hoped that whatever that thing was, it couldn‚Äôt figure out how to open a door. Victor was nowhere to be seen in my room, but I couldn't care less as I dove into my bed and stared in horror at my door. I was shivering so badly that in my terror, I did the only thing I could think of, I hid under my blanket like a child.¬†



I heard whatever it was approach my door before it began to claw at my door with its long limbs. It tried a few more times to claw at the door, before suddenly it began to release a strange noise. Almost like a rotisserie chicken being ripped apart. I poked my head out from underneath my blanket and saw that suddenly there was light under my door from the hallway. A simple knock suddenly came from the door, and to my horror, the door slowly swung open. But to my immense relief, it was Victor. He was holding a candle in his hand and had a worried look on his stitched-up face. But upon seeing me in my bed, his expression softened into one of relief.¬†



‚ÄúOh, thank God, it‚Äôs you, Victor,‚Äù I sighed out in relief. I‚Äôd never been happier to see his stitched up face in my life, except maybe when he had saved me from Melite. He seemed just as relieved to see me in bed. I tossed the covers off of me and walked over to my desk, pulling out the chair for him. Victor tilted his head ever so slightly, wondering what I was doing. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal. You can stay in my room and watch me. But please just sit here and look the other way. I can‚Äôt sleep with you staring at me.‚Äù Victor looked down at the chair and then brought his hand to scratch at his face. He then walked over to the chair and sat down in it. I nodded before turning to my bed and lying back down. I covered myself up with the blankets and was finally able to get some sleep.¬†



I awoke at the crack of dawn like I always did. Sitting up in bed, I stretched a bit before putting my glasses back on and looking over at Victor. He was slumped over my desk with his face in his arms. He looked to be sound asleep, and by the bit of his head that was slightly poking out, it looked like some of the best sleep he‚Äôd gotten in who knew how long. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at him as I removed my comforter and gently draped it over his sleeping form. I quietly changed into my clothes before leaving Victor to finish sleeping in my room.¬†



There were a few other members of the Freakshow awake already as well. Eva was practicing on an outdoor pommel horse, and I gently waved to her. She waved at me without missing a beat of her swinging movements. I walked over to the bakery and saw that Abigail was already inside. Opening the door, she turned to greet me with a big smile, before her eyes zeroed in on my newly acquired burned arm.¬†



‚ÄúWhat happened?!‚Äù she asked, worry plastered all over her face, as she quickly set a tray of muffins down and rushed over to examine my arm. I looked down at it and saw that while most of it had healed, there were still plenty of patches of burnt remaining skin. I brushed it off with a quick explanation of an accident. She was still obviously worried, but she quickly pulled me inside the bakery. She sat me down and quickly brought me a cup of coffee. I told her that Mathieu would be coming with Chloe, and she stopped in her tracks again and looked at me. Before gently nodding and saying that she would make some danishes for us all.¬†



She felt off. Not just because she‚Äôd seen my damaged arm, but the mention of Chloe and Mathieu was clearly rubbing her the wrong way. As she came by with another pot of coffee for me, I reached out and touched her arm. She looked at me, and I looked back up at her. ‚ÄúI have to get her out of here. Abigail, you don‚Äôt know how bad my life was after what happened here at the Freakshow. When I got back to America, I didn‚Äôt even speak more than four words for years. It completely destroyed me, and I just can‚Äôt have another kid go through that again.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI understand, Benny.‚Äù She looked at me, and it seemed that all those years were starting to catch up wth her. She looked exhausted, not just physically but mentally. She loved everyone here at the Freakshow like they were her children. And I couldn‚Äôt imagine how painful it was for her to see them die. She had to understand that what I was doing was the only way to save Chloe. As we talked, the door to the bakery opened, and Mathieu stepped in with Chloe following close behind him. She looked exhausted, which made sense, being that she was up so early. Mathieu walked over to the table that I was sitting at and sat down across from me. He was obviously pissed at having been woken up by me late in the middle of the night. He ordered a strong cup of coffee, while Abigail brought a sleepy Chloe a muffin. She took it and walked over to a booth, sitting up on it and placing her balloon dog on the table.¬†



As Mathieu drank his coffee, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the four little figures hovering outside the door of the bakery. ‚ÄúI think you forgot some things.‚Äù I smiled as I pointed towards the door. Mathieu looked behind him, his stone body cracking slightly as he looked. He rolled his eyes before turning back to his cup of coffee.¬†



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like little ducklings,‚Äù he mumbled into his coffee. The Aces each took turns trying to jump up and reach the doorknob, trying to open the door. Abigail walked over and opened it for them, and they filed into the store excitedly. Abigail sat them down at the same booth that Chloe was sitting in, and began handing everyone at that booth some papers and crayons to draw with.¬†

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan? Going to try and run into the fence again?‚Äù Mathieu asked as he looked at my burnt arm. Drinking that coffee with his thick accent, he couldn‚Äôt help but look and sound arrogant. I waved him away as I stood up from the chair and walked over to the Aces. I asked them for some paper and a crayon and Spades stole Heart‚Äôs papers and crayons and readily handed them over to me. I returned to the desk with Mathieu and began to map out my plan on the back of Hearts scribbled paper.¬†



‚ÄúIt has to be under the cover of night. That‚Äôs obvious enough. And we need you to make illusions of all of us. If Tony catches wind too early, we‚Äôre all goners. So if you can make illusions of us asleep in our rooms, that won‚Äôt be a problem.‚Äù I explained, beginning to write down on the piece of paper. Mathieu set his cup of coffee down and began to stroke his chin as he watched me. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, I‚Äôll try and cut the wire that powers the electric fence. Or at least a partial section of it. From there, we can cut a section of it and hopefully get out of here.‚Äù I explained, writing out everything and including a small drawn diagram.¬†



‚ÄúIt could work.‚Äù Mathieu nodded, stroking his chin in thought. I looked over at the counter and noticed that Abigail was fidgeting behind it. She had been methodically cleaning the same coffee cup since Matheiu had entered the bakery. I slid the plans over to Mathieu and stood up to talk to her. Mathieu took the paper from me and looked down to examine it.¬†



‚ÄúAbigail, I‚Äôm not a kid anymore. I‚Äôm not in my room coming up with some half assed escape plan with crayons.‚Äù I looked over at my new escape plan, also now made with crayons. ‚ÄúOkay, maybe I should‚Äôve used a pen or something.‚Äù I conceded. She smiled and reached a hand out to touch my cheek gently.¬†



‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt help but worry about you.‚Äù She sighed, rubbing my cheek with her thumb. I nodded and sighed softly. It was in her nature to worry like this. I looked over to the Aces and saw that all of them were happily scribbling on their pieces of paper. And Hearts was getting his mask drawn on by Spades.¬†



‚ÄúI could bring you with us. If you‚Äôre so worried about me. You could be with me every day, and you‚Äôd never lose me again,‚Äù I said with a smile. She looked at me and slowly dropped her hand from my cheek. She seemed caught off guard by my offer, like that thought had never once crossed her mind. I was lying if I wasn‚Äôt offering her out of a selfish desire to bring her home, and have her as my actual mom.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù she said with a sweet smile, turning back to her ovens to check on the danishes. I smiled and looked back over to the Aces, who had stopped using the paper and had now started scribbling on the tablecloth. Mathieu was quickly yelling at them, ordering them to behave themselves. He ended up having to give them more paper to keep them satisfied in their wild scribble fest. I then looked at Chloe and noticed that she didn‚Äôt seem to be enjoying herself.¬†



She seemed bored, or even upset about something. She was only drawing spirals on her piece of paper and seemed to be taking no interest in the Aces as they were having the time of their life. I walked over to her and sat next to her, taking a look at what she was drawing.¬†



‚ÄúAre you okay? Do you want to go do something else?‚Äù I asked her, watching as she began to doodle another spiral on a fresh sheet of paper. She simply shook her head and gave me a quiet ‚Äòno‚Äô as a response to my question. I guessed that she was still groggy from being woken up so early. I nodded and handed her a small plate of Danish once Abigail was done baking them. We all sat and enjoyed Abigail‚Äôs cooking, and I soon finalized the details of our escape plan with Mathieu. We split up from the bakery, having decided that the sooner we start, the better. We aimed for tonight when the weather had predicted an overcast night.¬†



Before I left Abigail‚Äôs bakery, I had asked her for a few coins, to which she happily gave me a few. I fiddled around with them in my hands as I began to approach Izara‚Äôs box. If I was going to attempt an escape tonight, I needed her wisdom and whatever cryptic hint she would be willing to give me. Arriving at her spot, I couldn‚Äôt help but shiver at seeing my old friend trapped inside a wooden box with glass windows. I swallowed my anxiety and pushed a few coins into the slot.¬†



She awoke with a jolt and began blinking before her lifeless eyes landed on me. The plastered smile on her now mechanical body seemed genuine, and she offered me a little wave from behind her box. I waved back at her, just comforted in knowing that she still remembered me.¬†



‚ÄúThe man, come to redeem himself. But all that seems to follow him is death and pain,‚Äù she said after a few seconds of mechanical whirring from inside her box. I flinched at her words, they were harsh sounding. But with Izara, cryptic may as well have been her middle name. ‚ÄúSomething you love dearly, you will lose today, my friend. And something you wish to keep, will turn on you.‚Äù Her crystal ball began to glow, along with her one pure white eye.¬†



‚ÄúW-what do you mean, Izara? Please, tell me what‚Äôs going to happen today!‚Äù I begged her, pushing my hands and my face against the glass separating us. She stared down at her crystal ball, and slowly she powered down. But as she did, her box spat out another tarot card. I reached down and yanked it out, my trembling hands presented me with the tarot card of the tower. I clutched my chest as I began to hyperventilate. The tower card symbolized doom and destruction. Something horrible was going to happen during my escape attempt. Was I going to die? Or Chloe? I placed my hand against Izara‚Äôs box as I began to have a panic attack.¬†



I struggled to catch my breath as everything began to collapse in on me. Would what happened to Santiago and Nikolai happen all over again? Would even more people die because of me? Was I just a walking bringer of tragedy and horror to everyone? What if I just took myself out and saved Garibaldi the trouble? Before this spiral could continue any further, however, I felt a small form wrap itself around my leg.¬†



Staring down, I saw that Hearts was gently hugging my leg. I was so caught off guard at him being there all of a sudden that for a moment it snapped me out of my panic spiral, and I couldn‚Äôt help but give him a small laugh and gently rub his messy brown hair. He looked up at me after rubbing his mask into my leg for a moment, before he gently let me go and produced a piece of paper from inside his giant sleeve. He handed it to me, and I accepted it. I stared down at it and couldn‚Äôt help but tear up at seeing that Hearts had drawn a picture of all of the Aces together with me.¬†



‚ÄúThank you so much,‚Äù I told him, getting down on my knees and hugging his small skeleton body as tight as I could without snapping him in half. He hugged me back before pulling away and motioning for me to follow him. I stood up from the ground, and while I dusted myself off, I looked back at Izara. Her warnings still hung over my head, but I knew that I had to go forward with my plan. There were things in my life that I wanted to fight for. For Chloe, for my students, and for myself.¬†



Hearts led me back to Mathieu‚Äôs room, where the gargoyle was sitting on his bed. The Aces were looking everywhere for Hearts, and when he showed up with me, they all rushed Hearts and began to wrestle around with him. Mathieu was filing his claws with what looked to be a horse hoof file, and he sighed with a roll of his eyes.¬†



‚ÄúKnock it off. Come here, Hearts.‚Äù He ordered. The other three quickly hopped off of Hearts. The bullied Ace quickly dusted himself off before waddling over to Mathieu and began to wave his arms around at his master. Mathieu nodded and looked over to me after Herat's little flapping session was finished. ‚ÄúI tell it the witch, didn‚Äôt give you good news?‚Äù he asked me, sitting up with a loud grunt, his stone body cracking again and groaning ever so slightly.¬†



‚ÄúShe just, said some things that messed me up.‚Äù I sighed, rubbing my hands across my face and under my glasses. I plopped them down at my side, and as I did, Mathieu patted the spot on his bed. I walked over and sat next to him. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶have so many regrets. Especially with Santiago and Nikolai. I caused their deaths, Mathieu. It was because of me that they died‚Ä¶and I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to say goodbye to them. For all they knew, I was eaten by Antonio right after them.‚Äù I sighed heavily, my voice wavering as I thought back to that horrible day. I felt Mathieu‚Äôs stone hand placed on my back.



‚ÄúWhat if you could tell them you survived?‚Äù he asked me. I looked at him with a raised brow. To my knowledge, I didn‚Äôt believe that the Frenchmen could bring people back from the dead. But I gently nodded. I wanted nothing more than to be able to tell them that I was okay and that I had made it. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be exactly like talking to them, but I‚Äôm sure you could use this.‚Äù He grunted, wiggling his fingers as they began to be covered in sparkles, and soon he tossed the sparkles off his hand and out in front of us.



The sprakles landed on the floor and soon began to take the form of two people. I covered my mouth as they began to grow in detail, and to my shock and awe, Nikolai and Santiago were standing before me. I looked at Mathieu, as he had his eyes closed and was holding his claws out in front of him to seemingly keep the illusion alive.¬†



‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt talk, but I hope this will be enough.‚Äù He mumbled, deep in concentration. I nodded quickly, before standing up from the bed and approaching the illusions of my long-gone friends. I had so many things that I wanted to tell them. So many things that I wanted to apologize for. And yet in that moment, with the two of them standing before me, exactly as they were on the day that they died, I found that I couldn‚Äôt say anything. But after finally gaining some composure, I walked up to them, noticing just how short Santiago was now when compared to me.



‚ÄúThank you both so much. You made it so that I could have a life. And while that life was full of plenty of issues‚Ä¶a life with issues is better than no life at all. And without you two, I would‚Äôve died that day. I‚Äôll always remember and cherish the time we had together and the fun we had.‚Äù I walked up to them and opened my arms to them. They smiled proudly at me before walking up and hugging me. It felt like it was from a real person, and I cherished that small moment, hugging them as tightly as I could. ‚ÄúThank you for everything,‚Äù I mumbled as the tears began to flow from my eyes and stick to my glasses. Slowly, they began to vanish from my grip, and soon I was alone, hugging the air again.¬†



I turned around to thank Mathieu, but was horrified to see him slumped over, panting. I rushed over to him and quickly helped him lie down in bed. The Aces quickly ran over to check on their master, and I watched in horror as the stone on Mathieu‚Äôs body began to spread further across his body.¬†



‚ÄúSeems I exerted myself too much,‚Äù he panted, groaning in pain as the stone began to cover more of his body. ‚ÄúIf I use too much magic, it spreads quicker.‚Äù He panted, the stone finally stopping after covering up most of his face except for his eye and a bit of his forehead. I held his claw as he gripped my hand. The Aces crowded around him and were obviously worried about him.¬†



‚ÄúWe need to escape tonight, then. If this is happening to you, we don‚Äôt have much time left.‚Äù Mathieu nodded as he had me help him sit back up. It was decided that Mathieu would rest up, while I went out to scope a good place to take down the fence and cut a hole through it. Leaving Mathieu in the care of the Aces, I went out and stopped by my room. Victor was long gone by this point, but he wasn‚Äôt who I was looking for. I walked over to my closet and peeked inside, remembering that once, Nikolai had left a knife in my room. And it was still there. I picked it up and stuck it in my pocket before quickly exiting my room and heading out into the Freakshow grounds.¬†



I began looking around for a breaker box that I could use to disable the fence. But it seemed that everywhere I looked, there wasn‚Äôt so much as a hint of a breaker box or any power source that might be powering the fence. I was about to give up when I rounded a corner and was suddenly brought face to face with Garibaldi. He seemed furious, but he wasn‚Äôt the person I was looking at. Because standing next to him was Abigail.¬†



‚ÄúAlready trying to escape, Benjamin? Why am I not surprised in the least?‚Äù he hissed at me, gripping his mantis cane tightly in his claws as he glared at me. I looked at Abigail, my heart breaking at the fact that she‚Äôd betrayed me. Her face was one of pain as well.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Benny. But I can‚Äôt lose another son. I just can‚Äôt!‚Äù She apologized vehemently. But Garibaldi was furious, and I watched as his body began to morph and stretch even further than it already was. He was going to turn into a mantis and probably rip me to shreds there and then. But I had a moment, a brief moment where, as he transformed, he‚Äôd be vulnerable.¬†



‚ÄúHow dare you try and ruin everything again!‚Äù Garibaldi screamed, his body slowly morphing into his mantis form. His facial scar split open to reveal the row of teeth that hid behind it. I gripped the knife‚Äôs handle as I watched him. I looked over at Abigail, and I could see that in her heart she was ashamed at what she had done, and she was watching in terror as Garibaldi began to transform into a mantis.¬†



Pulling the knife out of my pocket, I quickly began to run towards Garibaldi at full speed. Then, as I raised my knife about to plunge it into Garibaldi‚Äôs body‚Ä¶Abigail shoved him out of the way. It all happened in slow motion, as she shoved him away, my knife plunged deep into her neck.¬†



‚ÄúN-No!‚Äù I screamed in terror, quickly grabbing her as she went limp, and the two of us fell to the ground. ‚ÄúW-why did you do that?!‚Äù I screamed at her, unsure of what to do as she began to lose blood and cough violently with the knife sticking out of her neck. She choked and shivered, but slowly brought her hand up to my face to gently rub it.



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶still my family,‚Äù she mumbled gently, her voice growing weaker as she continued to bleed out in my arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy‚Ä¶I got to see you again‚Ä¶my sweet‚Ä¶Ben‚Ä¶n‚Ä¶y.‚Äù Her arm grew limp and fell to the floor. I gripped her body tightly, shaking her and begging her not to leave me. I screamed my heart out as I clutched her body. I looked over at where Garibaldi had been pushed too, and saw that he‚Äôd stopped his transformation and was staring in shock at Abigail‚Äôs body.¬†



He gripped his head tightly and began screaming just as loudly as I was, smashing his hands against his head hard and screaming. His whole body began to twitch and tick as he watched Abigail die in my arms. Suddenly, a whole group of Freakshow members converged on us, no doubt drawn by our painful screams. Victor quickly rushed over to Garibaldi and placed his hands on the ringleader‚Äôs face, gently placing his forehead against Garibaldi‚Äôs as the mantis cried and howled in anguish.¬†



I meanwhile gripped Abigail‚Äôs body tightly and thought back to what Izara had said. It was true‚Ä¶death followed me everywhere. I began to scream and tug at the knife in her throat, wanting nothing else but to join her. But before I could, I was yanked away from her body. Looking behind me, I saw that it was Mathieu and Starla, both pulling me away from Abigail‚Äôs body as I screamed and begged them to just kill me. It was all my fault again.

question about OPUS cards:  
This is my first time properly visiting the city and I'd like to do some exploring. Particularly, one of the things I'd like to go to zone C and hike Mont-Saint Hilaire. I arrive by train on Sunday. Do I just walk around the station and find a kiosk and load it up on the card? The [website ](https://www.artm.quebec/en/points-of-sale/)says Gare Centrale is closed on Sundays, will I still be able to get the card? 

Food:   
I love food! I have a pretty flexible budget and would love to try (in no order):

1) Iced Coffee  
2) Montreal fine dining   
3) Smoked meat   
4) Any staple Montreal restaurants 

Merci! ",0,1755629319.0,montreal,3,0.17,False

1mur8nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPune/comments/1mur8nl/23m_i_destroyed_lost_the_best_thing_happened_to/,"[23M] I destroyed/ lost the best thing happened to me in a long time. whatever community i am trying to post shows that i have less account age and karma, so decided to post here . Will you please give your honest opinion on my situation ?","( Sorry if this is big)

my gf(22) broke up with me after we dated for 1 year. she broke up 4 days ago. Right now i don't know what to do, i am not able to sleep for the past days properly.

**Why I‚Äôm writing this:**¬†I‚Äôm not a monster. I‚Äôm a 23-year-old idiot who got the best thing he‚Äôll ever have and was too stupid and selfish to see he was crushing it. I‚Äôm earning well. I‚Äôm decent-looking, I shower regularly. But none of that matters. The person I became with her was ugly. I came here to post because i can be honest here and hopefully get honest unfiltered opinions.  
I want to hear honest opinions and want to know should i even try to fix things .

We were both outsiders, trying to make it in Pune. We met at a mutual friend's birthday party in KP a year ago. She was‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ the most complete person I‚Äôve ever known. Beautiful, hot, sexy yeah, stunningly so, but that‚Äôs the least of it. She‚Äôs sharp, witty in a quiet way that would sneak up on you. She‚Äôs deeply thoughtful. ¬†She was my best friend. We‚Äôd spend Sundays just driving around on my bike exploring new places in city. I told my parents about her. Not in detail, just that I‚Äôd met someone special, someone from a good family.

**How I fucked up**¬†( these are some points she emphasized on i am trying to tell in my words).

1. We mostly hung out at my place because her flat in viman nagar felt like her territory. My place is a 2BHK with three other guys. I share my room with my flatmate. I‚Äôd ask him to leave so we could have ‚Äúprivacy,‚Äù which I thought was me being a good boyfriend. She said it made her feel like¬†an inconvenience. And worse, when we¬†*were*¬†in the common areas, I had no boundaries. I‚Äôd pull her onto my lap while the guys were watching TV. I‚Äôd grab her ass or squeeze her waist when I walked past her in the kitchen. I thought it was just being affectionate, showing how much I wanted her. I see now it was a display. I was marking my territory in front of them. It made her feel like an object, not a person. And I‚Äôm realizing even as I write this, I‚Äôm doing it again. I‚Äôm describing her body, the grabbing. I‚Äôm sexualizing her in my fucking apology. This is the disease in my brain I can‚Äôt seem to cure.
2. **I violated her privacy for bro-points.**¬†This one makes me sick of myself now that i think about it . One afternoon, we were all just lounging around. Rohit and Vikram were there. Anya was sitting on the floor leaning against my legs. It felt nice. Domestic. Then, like a complete fucking idiot, I said, ‚ÄúHey, you never told me, did you like that black lingerie I got you?‚Äù The room went silent. I thought I was just being open, including her in the ‚Äúbro‚Äù circle. I was actually humiliating her, inconsiderate of any intimate detail for a cheap laugh and a nod of approval from my friends. She froze. I‚Äôll never forget the look on her face. She told me later that my flatmates‚Äô glances at her became creepier, more lustful, after that. She said they felt entitled to look because I‚Äôd made her seem available for their appraisal. I created that environment. I made my own home an unsafe space for her.
3. **I was oblivious to her needs for safety.**¬†She told me she sometimes walked to the kitchen in just shorts and a bra, or in a thin t-shirt with no bra. I thought it meant she was comfortable, cool. I was actually proud of it. I‚Äôd see Vikram glance over and I‚Äôd feel a twisted sense of pride.¬†*Look what I have.*¬†I didn‚Äôt see that she might have been testing me. Waiting to see if I‚Äôd finally put up a boundary, if I‚Äôd protect her. I failed that test completely. now when i think that from 3rd person perspective it sounds gross to me .
4. **I was a selfish, entitled lover.**¬†I have a high drive. I wanted her all the time. And I‚Äôd ask. For sex, for blowjobs. And she‚Äôd usually say yes. I took that as enthusiasm. She says she felt obligated, that it was a transaction to keep me happy. How was I supposed to know? But that‚Äôs the fucking point. I was supposed to¬†*know*. I was supposed to be attend to her, to see the difference between a eager yes and a resigned one. I was too focused on what I wanted. During sex, I‚Äôd sometimes playfully slap her ass. She always moaned. I thought she loved it. She told me in the coffee shop she hated it, that she froze every time, that it made her feel degraded. I thought the moan was the truth. I never learned to listen to her silence.
5. **I was a shitty partner outside the bedroom too.( sometimes)**¬†I‚Äôd cancel plans with her friends. I‚Äôd tune out when she talked about her new job because my code was more important. i used to get handsy with her in public. touching and grabbing her in places i should never have done in a public place.

She broke up with me at a cafe. I thought it was just coffee. She laid it all out, calm as anything, I had no defense. Because everything she said was true.

i checked her whatsapp and instagram. She hasn‚Äôt blocked me. She‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ removed me. Our story highlights are gone.

is there any chance?¬†Any chance at all that I could become a man who deserves her? Not the performative, possessive boy I was, but a real partner? Is it even fair to her to try? Or is the most loving thing I can do now to leave her the fuck alone so she can find someone who won‚Äôt need a fucking Reddit post to learn how to treat her with basic decency?

1mur41m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1mur41m/elvanse_with_amfexa_and_toilet_issues/,Elvanse with amfexa and toilet issues?,"Hey Reddit, I started on Elvanse/Vyvanse in Feb for the first time (30mg for 2 weeks, 50mg for one week and then 70mg for one week).

Shortly after I started taking 60mg Elvanse in the morning and 10mg amfexa around lunchtime (to reduced the wired-ness effects, and also some hair loss started to occur. I can‚Äôt remember exactly when the toilet symptoms started but it was in Feb or March time this year.

Since taking the medication, as expected, appetite suppressed and had loads of great effects at the start, which 6 months on, are still happening, but I think it‚Äôs become the norm so don‚Äôt notice them as much, unless I have a day/days without Elvanse and it‚Äôs wild to think how I coped without it before!

I have Greek yoghurt, banana and granola for breakfast, usually a mix of rice, tuna, chicken sandwiches, salad for lunch and coffees in the morning, then whatever else I fancy in the evenings, as I know protein is importsnt for the medication to work.

Since Feb/march time, I‚Äôve had extremely painful on and off issues when passing stools, it started with lots of blood when wiping, and pain using the toilet and especially pain when sitting. After a long time of it not going away (or going for a few days then coming back), I understood it was anal fissures causing the pain.

I then upped my fibre intake, introducing milled flaxseed and ground oat bran to try and help the issue. I struggle to work out what the issue is, as it‚Äôs not constipation as I‚Äôve known it before (inability to pass when you feel you need to). I think it‚Äôs where tears have happened and then struggled to heal.

I suffered for a few months and found retrogresic ointment which really helped with healing and the pain, and stopped amfexa for a few weeks which got rid of the issues after a few more weeks in July.

I then found the effects of medication mentally wearing off, so had 3 days off of all meds, to see if the positive effects would increase when going back on them.

I then reintroduced amfexa, and unsure if it was at this time or just coincidence due to unbalanced diet in the days before, heatwave, alcohol, not enough water, but had a really painful stool, which created new tears and have been battling the pain for a few days with retrogesic.

I asked my prescriber at the time and she hadn‚Äôt heard of these issues before, I wonder has anyone had any similar experiences?

Is there something simple I‚Äôm doing wrong? Not enough fibre? Not enough water? Should i have half the amfexa in AM and the other half in PM?

Whilst the medication is working well for the Elvanse (amfexa too, just feel a bit wired when on it for a few hours in the afternoon. I wouldn‚Äôt want to stop it though as I don‚Äôt crash after work if I‚Äôve had it so helps a lot to get life admin done and keep energy levels up in the evening! Even though I‚Äôve noticed it does make getting to sleep more difficult.) ‚Ä¶whilst Elvanse is fine, if amfexa is causing the fissures, I can‚Äôt live with this forever and retrogesic is weirdly expensive!

Can anyone relate? Or have any advice or tips!

Thanks :)

1mur2lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mur2lb/reveal_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Breville VertuoPlus Worth It?,"Testing the Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 coffee and espresso machine has been an interesting experience for me as someone who enjoys a good cup of coffee every morning. The machine‚Äôs sleek design and straightforward operation hold immediate appeal, but is the caffeine nirvana worth it? Here's my take after several weeks of pulling shots and brewing cups.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minimalist grey exterior with a polished chrome finish blends effortlessly with my kitchen decor. Its compact dimensions (6""D x 17""W x 13""H) make it well-suited for small countertops, like mine, where space feels precious. The Breville team clearly designed the product for functionality. The water tank, with a generous 40-ounce capacity, is removable and swivels to fit into tight spots. However, I did notice that the tank lid feels a little delicate; I‚Äôm cautious every time I refill it because it doesn't seem too forgiving of rough handling. Still, this machine's sturdy overall construction outweighs minor concerns about fragility.  

**User Experience and Operation**  
Operating this coffee maker is blissfully straightforward. It‚Äôs fully automatic, with a simple button interface that anyone can master. I particularly love the Centrifusion technology, which cleverly reads the barcode on each coffee capsule to adjust brewing settings. Whether I wanted a single espresso shot or a larger 8-ounce coffee, the resulting brew was consistently rich and flavorful. As someone who barely functions before caffeine intake, the 20‚Äì25-second preheat time was a lifesaver during my rushed mornings. However, one potential downside lies in the capsule system; because it exclusively uses a proprietary coffee capsule design, you‚Äôre locked into the Nespresso ecosystem. Admittedly, the complementary range of capsules provided with the machine gave me a great starter set to experiment with, which was fun.  

**Versatility in Coffee Options**  
What surprised me most was the range of beverages this coffee maker can handle. From iced coffee to lattes, I‚Äôve managed to replicate a small cafe menu in my kitchen. Pressing a single-button switch gives me the flexibility of four cup sizes spanning 5 oz, 8 oz, and single or double espresso shots. Experimenting with iced drinks has been a joy, especially during warmer evenings when a cold brew feels divine. Although this machine lacks a built-in milk frother‚Äîit‚Äôs included separately and works seamlessly‚Äîit would have been more convenient to have an all-in-one design. Still, the resulting foamed milk for cappuccinos and macchiatos is excellent.

**Highlights**  
- Compact design fits into small spaces.  
- Effortless operation with one-button brewing and Centrifusion technology.  
- Delivers cafe-quality espresso and drip coffee.  
- Large, 40-ounce removable water tank enhances convenience.  
- Heats up quickly, perfect for busy mornings.  

[Check Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b01n13vkqn/)

**Areas of Concern**  
- Capsule system locks you into Nespresso‚Äôs proprietary pods.  
- Water tank lid feels slightly fragile.  
- Lacks an integrated milk frother, which some competitors offer.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee and espresso machine to other offerings highlights both its strengths and some areas where it falls short. Keurig's K-Cafe, for instance, has the advantage of using more versatile K-Cup pods and includes a built-in milk frother at a similar price point. Still, Breville's Centrifusion brewing system delivers superior coffee quality that feels richer. Another competitor, the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica, boasts a more affordable price tag and supports ground coffee alongside ESE pods, adding flexibility. However, its setup is less beginner-friendly than Breville‚Äôs intuitive machine, which does everything for you at the push of a button.

**True Value**  
For someone like me who values premium coffee without spending too much time or effort, this machine justifies its price in features and performance. Sure, it costs more than some budget options, but the build quality, flavor consistency, and brand backing add considerable long-term appeal. Considering competitors, the Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 stands out for hassle-free versatility, though its proprietary coffee capsules make ongoing costs slightly above average. If you enjoy the convenience of single-serve coffee makers combined with caf√©-style brewing, the investment feels worthwhile.

I've noticed many independent shops in my city no longer have iced coffee and instead have replaced it with cold brew. while others offer both cold brew and iced coffee.

Unfortunately, I do not like cold brew, as I find it too strong. So when ordering I specifically ask ""do you have iced coffee"" - more times than not the barista will then show me their variety of cold brew, offering. I kindly explain I am not looking for cold brew. I would like iced coffee instead. Usually at this point, the barista gets frustrated and or gives me a look like I'm being difficult.

Why do baristas (not all) don't know the difference between iced coffee and cold brew? Is there anyway that I could explain myself better?

I love you SO SO SO much; it's a feeling unlike anything I've ever experienced. You bring a light into my life that I can‚Äôt imagine being without.

Every day without you feels incomplete. Your laughter echoes in my mind, and I find myself smiling at the memories we‚Äôve created together. I cherish the little things, the way your eyes sparkle when you're happy, the comfort of your embrace, and the silly moments that make us laugh until we cry.

I have to tell you that just seeing your name pop up on my phone fills me with joy. It‚Äôs like a burst of happiness that lights up my day, no matter what I‚Äôm going through. You have this incredible ability to make me feel special and loved, even from a distance.

I often think about our future and all the adventures we still have to share. Whether it‚Äôs cozy nights in, spontaneous trips, or quiet mornings with coffee, everything is better with you by my side. You inspire me to be my best self, and I‚Äôm so grateful for your support and love.

The world feels a little less bright without you. I find myself daydreaming about the next time I‚Äôll see you, how it will feel to hold you close again, to share stories, and to just be together. I miss our late-night talks, the way we can talk for hours about anything and everything.

Your presence makes everything feel right. You have this incredible ability to calm my worries and fill my heart with joy. I can‚Äôt wait for all the moments we still have ahead of us, celebrating milestones, exploring new places, and simply enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I often replay our favorite memories in my mind, from our spontaneous adventures to those quiet evenings spent just being together. Each memory is like a little treasure that I hold onto. I can‚Äôt help but smile thinking about the way you always know how to make me laugh, even on my toughest days.

I also look forward to the moments when we can dream together, plan our future, and support each other in our goals. You make me believe that anything is possible, and that‚Äôs such a beautiful gift.

Please come back soon; I can't wait to hold you close and create more beautiful memories together. You are my everything, and I‚Äôm counting down the days until we‚Äôre together again. Until then, know that you are loved deeply and missed beyond measure.

1mur0gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mur0gl/explore_if_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_coffee_maker/,Explore if the OXO Rapid Brewer coffee maker review meets your expectations!,"Testing coffee makers is something I take seriously, especially as someone who thrives on a strong, smooth brew to power through the day. The OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer instantly caught my attention because it promises a rich cup of coffee in record time, minus the hassle of bulky machines or overpriced caf√© stops. As a frequent traveler and self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I had to see whether this compact contraption lived up to its bold claims.

**Design Already Makes An Impression**

The first thing I noticed about this product is its sleek, minimalist design. Measuring just 3 inches in width and 10.5 inches in height, it‚Äôs compact enough to slide into a backpack or even a medium-sized purse. Picture yourself throwing this into your carry-on for a weekend trip‚Äîno more suffering through bitter hotel coffee! At just over a pound, it‚Äôs amazingly lightweight yet feels sturdy in hand. The black finish gives it a modern touch, which I‚Äôm a sucker for when it comes to kitchen gadgets.

It‚Äôs also incredibly user-friendly. Flooded morning brain? No problem. Clear fill lines, a built-in tamper for smooth-extraction, and a locking pump system keep things straightforward. The carafe and water chamber are made from Tritan Renew, a material with 50% recycled content. Slight nod to eco-friendliness? I‚Äôll take it.

**Features Shine Bright**

What sets this coffee maker apart is its versatility. It can whip up a hot brew in just two minutes or smoothly deliver a low-acid cold brew in five minutes. No plugs, no charging‚Äîjust manual craftsmanship. It comes equipped with a built-in stainless-steel filter, which eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, saving both time and money. My favorite feature has to be the ""rainmaker showerhead,"" which distributes water evenly over the coffee grounds, ensuring well-balanced flavor extraction.

Another standout is how customizable the brewing process is. Adjust the grounds, water volume, and temperature to your liking, and voil√†‚Äîyou‚Äôre essentially your own barista. I experimented with a 1:2 coffee-to-water ratio for a robust Americano and was thoroughly impressed. The device is also dishwasher-safe (except the pump), simplifying cleanup. Honestly, having everything but one part cleaned in the dishwasher might just be the gift I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

**Coffee Enthusiasts Will Appreciate The Performance**

Performance-wise, the Rapid Brewer lives up to its name. The concentrated coffee it produces is bold, well-rounded, and far from the bitter mess that some cheaper systems churn out. Testing the cold brew feature, I was surprised at how smooth and mellow it was in such a short brewing time. Plus, the ability to create concentrated coffee means you can get creative‚Äîfrom lattes to Vietnamese iced coffee, even affogato for dessert.

Some might find the manual pump slightly tedious, but personally, I didn‚Äôt mind it. It feels like you‚Äôre a part of the crafting process, giving you more control over the final result. Call me crazy, but there‚Äôs something therapeutic about pumping out your own coffee after a long day.

**Strengths**

- Compact and portable design.  
- No need for pods or paper filters.  
- Quick hot and cold brewing options.  
- Adjustable coffee strength for a personalized taste.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleaning.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Manual pumping may feel tiresome for some users.  
- Limited capacity‚Äîbetter suited for solo use or small servings.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing it to products like the AeroPress and the Hario V60, the Rapid Brewer stands out in terms of sheer portability. While the AeroPress boasts impressive manual brewing versatility, its brewing process involves more effort and multiple parts. The V60, on the other hand, requires precision pouring and works best with an electric kettle‚Äînot ideal for traveling or quick convenience. What‚Äôs refreshing about this product is its ability to deliver caf√©-quality concentrated coffee with minimal prep and even less cleanup.

However, the Rapid Brewer isn‚Äôt perfect. Unlike electric machines, it doesn‚Äôt produce a large quantity of coffee at once. If you‚Äôre hosting a group, you might find yourself making multiple rounds. Then again, it‚Äôs clearly pitched as a personal coffee maker, and it nails the ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù angle better than its peers.

**Price Performance**

From a cost-efficiency perspective, this coffee maker sits comfortably in the middle ground. It avoids the extravagance of automated brewers but still brings premium features into the mix, such as stainless steel construction and customizable brewing. Considering the durability, versatility, and ease of use, I‚Äôd absolutely say it‚Äôs worth the investment. On top of that, skipping overpriced coffee stops every day sweetens the deal. It‚Äôs one of those rare products that feel like a smart splurge for coffee enthusiasts.

1muqzvs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muqzvs,Geometric Pallet Wood + Epoxy Tabletop ‚Äì My First Build,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my first woodworking project and get some feedback from the community.

I‚Äôve always wanted to try woodworking but had zero experience. I saw one of Morley Kert‚Äôs videos where he built something out of pallet wood, and since I had some pallets lying around, that gave me the push to finally start. I picked up a table saw and a few other tools (from Facebook Marketplace and Home Depot), and the first thing I built was just a little table for my table saw to sit on.

Not long after, I came across another one of his videos where he built this geometric coffee table with epoxy. I loved the look of it and thought it would be the perfect challenge for my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù build. I used his video as my plan and followed along, since I didn‚Äôt make or use any traditional plans of my own. It seemed like a great way to try out new techniques while still keeping the project approachable. My goal with my first few projects is to pick something that teaches me a new skill or technique in a more exciting way than just starting with a box, though I‚Äôm not opposed to that later on.

One obstacle that stuck in my head from the beginning was how I‚Äôd flatten the top after pouring and letting the epoxy cure. In Morley‚Äôs video, he used a router sled, but I didn‚Äôt have one, and I don‚Äôt even have a proper workbench yet to put one on. I avoided thinking about it early because I figured if I did, I might give up on the build. Instead, I decided that when I finally reached that stage, I‚Äôd be forced to find a solution. Sure enough, when the time came, I found videos on how to make DIY router sled jigs, built one, and it worked.

That said, this step was also where I made one of my bigger mistakes. Partway through, I adjusted the router depth slightly (or so I thought), but it ended up cutting significantly deeper than I intended. At that point, my options were to either reduce the thickness of the whole table or cut the length of the table shorter. Since the mistake was close to an edge, I ended up trimming about 4‚Äì5 inches off the total length (\~2 inches off each side), which I was okay with in the end.

Another part I struggled with was the finishing. Since the table combines stained pallet wood and epoxy on the same surface, I wasn‚Äôt sure of the right process after sanding and staining to get a durable, smooth finish without messing up the look and keeping it simple. In the video, Morley used a Rubio monocoat, but I went with a polyurethane finish, and I'm not sure that was the best decision for this particular tabletop. This is where I‚Äôd love some advice from the community. What finishing approach would you recommend for a piece like this?

For the table legs, I bought a set from Amazon, but their width was too short to properly support the table. I tested it and found that if about 12kg was placed on the very edge, it would start to tip. That might never happen in normal use, but I didn‚Äôt want it to be a risk. Plus, I think it looks better when the legs span the full width. For now, I replaced them with a larger set of legs (same design) that provide proper support, though this, of course, raised the height and made it more of a desk than a coffee table. I don‚Äôt mind that, but eventually I‚Äôd like to make a set of custom legs myself that would give it the right height and stability for a coffee table.

This was a huge learning process, and I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on how to properly finish a piece like this, along with any other tips/recommendations, too.

I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone kind, fun, and down-to-earth ‚Äî someone who enjoys the little things like chill walks, laughing randomly, movies, or getting way too into a casual board game.

Whether it leads to something serious or just a meaningful connection, I‚Äôm easygoing and not into drama.

If that sounds like your kind of energy, send me a message  and tell me your go-to coffee order or a movie you love even if it‚Äôs a guilty pleasure.

my gf(22) broke up with me after we dated for 1 year. she broke up 4 days ago. Right now i don't know what to do, i am not able to sleep for the past days properly.

**Why I‚Äôm writing this:**¬†I‚Äôm not a monster. I‚Äôm a 23-year-old idiot who got the best thing he‚Äôll ever have and was too stupid and selfish to see he was crushing it. I‚Äôm earning well. I‚Äôm decent-looking, I shower regularly. But none of that matters. The person I became with her was ugly. I came here to post because i can be honest here and hopefully get honest unfiltered opinions.  
I want to hear honest opinions and want to know should i even try to fix things .

We were both outsiders, trying to make it in Pune. We met at a mutual friend's birthday party in KP a year ago. She was‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ the most complete person I‚Äôve ever known. Beautiful, yeah, stunningly so, but that‚Äôs the least of it. She‚Äôs sharp, witty in a quiet way that would sneak up on you. She‚Äôs deeply thoughtful. ¬†She was my best friend. We‚Äôd spend Sundays just driving around on my bike exploring new places in city. I told my parents about her. Not in detail, just that I‚Äôd met someone special, someone from a good family.

**How I fucked up**¬†( these are some points she emphasized on i am trying to tell in my words).

1. We mostly hung out at my place because her flat in viman nagar felt like her territory. My place is a 2BHK with three other guys. I share my room with my flatmate. I‚Äôd ask him to leave so we could have ‚Äúprivacy,‚Äù which I thought was me being a good boyfriend. She said it made her feel like¬†an inconvenience. And worse, when we¬†*were*¬†in the common areas, I had no boundaries. I‚Äôd pull her onto my lap while the guys were watching TV. I‚Äôd grab her ass or squeeze her waist when I walked past her in the kitchen. I thought it was just being affectionate, showing how much I wanted her. I see now it was a display. I was marking my territory in front of them. It made her feel like an object, not a person. And I‚Äôm realizing even as I write this, I‚Äôm doing it again. I‚Äôm describing her body, the grabbing. I‚Äôm sexualizing her in my fucking apology. This is the disease in my brain I can‚Äôt seem to cure.
2. **I violated her privacy for bro-points.**¬†This one makes me sick of myself now that i think about it . One afternoon, we were all just lounging around. Rohit and Vikram were there. Anya was sitting on the floor leaning against my legs. It felt nice. Domestic. Then, like a complete fucking idiot, I said, ‚ÄúHey, you never told me, did you like that black lingerie I got you?‚Äù The room went silent. I thought I was just being open, including her in the ‚Äúbro‚Äù circle. I was actually humiliating her, inconsiderate of any intimate detail for a cheap laugh and a nod of approval from my friends. She froze. I‚Äôll never forget the look on her face. She told me later that my flatmates‚Äô glances at her became creepier, more lustful, after that. She said they felt entitled to look because I‚Äôd made her seem available for their appraisal. I created that environment. I made my own home an unsafe space for her.
3. **I was oblivious to her needs for safety.**¬†She told me she sometimes walked to the kitchen in just shorts and a bra, or in a thin t-shirt with no bra. I thought it meant she was comfortable, cool. I was actually proud of it. I‚Äôd see Vikram glance over and I‚Äôd feel a twisted sense of pride.¬†*Look what I have.*¬†I didn‚Äôt see that she might have been testing me. Waiting to see if I‚Äôd finally put up a boundary, if I‚Äôd protect her. I failed that test completely. now when i think that from 3rd person perspective it sounds gross to me .
4. **I was a selfish, entitled lover.**¬†I have a high drive. I wanted her all the time. And I‚Äôd ask. For sex, for blowjobs. And she‚Äôd usually say yes. I took that as enthusiasm. She says she felt obligated, that it was a transaction to keep me happy. How was I supposed to know? But that‚Äôs the fucking point. I was supposed to¬†*know*. I was supposed to be attend to her, to see the difference between a eager yes and a resigned one. I was too focused on what I wanted. During sex, I‚Äôd sometimes playfully slap her ass. She always moaned. I thought she loved it. She told me in the coffee shop she hated it, that she froze every time, that it made her feel degraded. I thought the moan was the truth. I never learned to listen to her silence.

5)**I was a shitty partner outside the bedroom too.( sometimes)**¬†I‚Äôd cancel plans with her friends. I‚Äôd tune out when she talked about her new job because my code was more important. i used to get handsy with her in public. touching and grabbing her in places i should never have done in a public place.

She broke up with me at a cafe. I thought it was just coffee. She laid it all out, calm as anything, I had no defense. Because everything she said was true.

i checked her whatsapp and instagram. She hasn‚Äôt blocked me. She‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ removed me. Our story highlights are gone.

is there any chance?¬†Any chance at all that I could become a man who deserves her? Not the performative, possessive boy I was, but a real partner? Is it even fair to her to try? Or is the most loving thing I can do now to leave her the fuck alone so she can find someone who won‚Äôt need a fucking Reddit post to learn how to treat her with basic decency?",1,1755628591.0,AskMenRelationships,9,1.0,False

I had to and it is true: it was hard. I had headaches and brain fog for 6 days starting on day 2 of my detox. But I have had so many medical issues, it was almost easy to detox off of caffeine to help alleviate other symptoms and it worked.

  
Well - today I opened up a container of my decaf coffee. Upon reflection (after having a cup) I remember mixing caffeinated and un-caffeinated coffee into this container months ago on another quest to reduce caffeine intake. So today I've had probably 1/2 a cup of caffeinated coffee, here is what I've noticed:

* my energy spiked immediately and so did my emotions. I was in a work meeting going 100mph and got off the meeting and went to talk to my partner and was going 100mph with him and THAT's when I realized: Omfg I'm caffeinated.
* I was able to tell - easily - that I had consumed caffeine again and....
* it's ok. I immediately threw the container away and am going to ride the caffeine until it leaves my system (I'm not uncomfortable or anything, but can definitely see why I was so tired during my peak caffeine use. You can't go 100mph like that without 'coming down')
* I'll pick up the beautifully calm caffeine free life tomorrow with some rooibos 
* my slip up has not impacted my will or desire to remain caffeine free - it was almost scary to be so hyper suddenly and reflecting on this was a powerful lesson",8,1755628557.0,decaf,0,0.91,False

Asking here for unbiased opinions as the people I talk to are friends/family/ boyfriend so they probably just take my side even if I am the ass*** haha- 

So basically- my boyfriend and I share a house with another couple. 
How this dynamic started was my boyfriend got a house with his bestfriend who bestfriend (let‚Äôs call him Dave) got a girlfriend pretty soon after and moved in.
So Dave gets a girlfriend, moves her in (without asking my boyfriend) which caused a bit of tension but my boyfriend who is someone who doesn‚Äôt like to stir the pot just told him it wasn‚Äôt cool but they could move on.
Then my boyfriend meets me- we date for a year (me sleeping over on weekends) until I move in fully about 1.5 years later- 

NOW things with Dave‚Äôs girlfriend and I were never great. From day one, she was not welcoming - didn‚Äôt make much conversation, did a few passive aggressive things - and we could tell would get upset if I was using the kitchen to cook or bake (Dave‚Äôs girlfriend and I both love to bake and cook) 

Now- this is where I actually have a problem‚Ä¶ I work from home , and she took the last year off work and basically just would stay in the kitchen everyday for 3/4 hours just to bake- which okay is fine I guess but it would be hard for me to get in there to make lunch/ breakfast or even a coffee - cause remember things between her and I aren‚Äôt the greatest LOL, so we usually wait until one another is done.. so now she got a job also working from home and spends 5 hours DAILY in the kitchen but now with her work laptop just to bake. Idk if she sells shit on the side or does it for fun/ family but I think it‚Äôs so disrespectful? If you‚Äôre sharing a kitchen - should this like.. not be a thing? LOL. I feel rude saying something if it‚Äôs not a big deal but I feel like if you want to be in your kitchen that long.. get your own place? Now I know I could also get my own place but I just feel like my boyfriend and I aren‚Äôt the problem. We are respectful when it comes to sharing and being mindful.

1muqtgx,https://i.redd.it/p3mnw3lfs0kf1.jpeg,‚ÄúWake Up‚Ä¶‚Äù,"‚ÄúWake up‚Ä¶‚Äù
The whisper was just a little louder tonight.

For the past few nights, I‚Äôd been hearing the same phrase‚Äîalways at the same time. And every time, I‚Äôd jolt awake, heart racing, only to find nothing there. Just the cold stillness of night pressing in around me.

Derek was my best friend. I told him everything.
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ do you think your dreams are like, your subconscious trying to tell you something?‚Äù he asked, right before taking a big gulp of his coffee. He winced. ‚ÄúUgh, too hot,‚Äù he muttered, setting the cup back down on the table between us. He looked at me expectantly‚Äîit was my turn to respond.

I nodded slowly, letting him know I was still present. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. But it‚Äôs creepy. Maybe I just watch too many scary movies.‚Äù I took a careful sip of my drink, learning from his mistake.

His smirk caught me off guard.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I laughed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I know you don‚Äôt really think so either.‚Äù

I followed his gaze as he watched people walk past our table. He was thinking hard about something‚ÄîI could tell.

That‚Äôs when I remembered: he knew me better than anyone. He knew that deep down, I always believed there was something darker beneath the surface. I was the one who grew up glued to spooky stories, the one with an overactive imagination. What if it was a ghost whispering to me? Or an alien trying to make contact?
He knew I was weird. And I loved that about our friendship‚Äîhow he never made me feel bad about it.

That night, I fell into a sleep so deep I didn‚Äôt even feel it come on. One minute I was lying in bed, and the next it felt like I was weightless‚Äîsuspended on the edge of a cliff. Then suddenly, I fell.

My heart pounded in my chest as I opened my eyes to the familiar whisper: ‚ÄúWake up.‚Äù

But this time, something was different.
Hovering above my body was‚Ä¶ me. A reflection of myself staring down at me. I had to be dreaming.

The other me put a finger to her lips‚Äî‚ÄúShh.‚Äù

I tried to speak. ‚ÄúWhat? Who‚Ä¶?‚Äù My chest tightened. I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

She leaned in, her voice soft but urgent. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to still be here.‚Äù Her head shook slowly. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you waking up?‚Äù

Confused and breathless, I stared at her. I couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening. This had to be a dream.

Then, as I gasped for air, she vanished. Gone, like smoke in the air.

The next morning, I had to tell Derek. He listened, watching me carefully as I recounted every detail. I finished my story, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúDid you hear what I said?‚Äù I finally asked after a long silence.

Derek sat up straight, running his hands through his hair like he was bracing himself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, do you?‚Äù he said softly.

My heart dropped. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to wake up?‚Äù

I stared at him, stunned, my breath caught in my throat. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny,‚Äù I said, barely holding it together.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying everything,‚Äù he said, voice low and full of sorrow. ‚ÄúWe just want you to understand.‚Äù

My gaze dropped to my wrist.

A hospital bracelet.

I opened my mouth to speak, but somehow I already knew‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt really here. He couldn‚Äôt hear me.

A tear rolled down his cheek as he stood and quietly left the cold, sterile room.

I had my first and so far only relationship between 2019 and 2022 with a girl an hour's drive from where I live, so you could say it was a full-fledged long-distance relationship. The relationship ended because, unfortunately, it wasn't balanced; she never found time to come to my city, and I was always the one investing in this relationship, going to her city once a week or once every two weeks. I felt bad about this breakup for many months, especially since we had so many common interests... despite this, I accepted her request to remain ""friends""/""virtual friends"" so as not to lose her completely. Unfortunately, I discovered that over time she had, if you can say that, disowned this relationship and that in reality, according to her theory, there was never anything between us (despite it lasting almost 3 years, not a month) and that I never loved her.
In the meantime, despite this, I managed to continue with my hobbies and find a good job in cybersecurity.

Last spring, she made herself felt again: between one word and another, we tried to reconnect, meeting up for coffee or to celebrate her birthday. I wanted to see how it would go this time and if she had changed despite these years... she even vented to me, telling me she'd just broken up with her ex-boyfriend, seeing me as a kind of emotional support.
(Maybe that was why she'd started texting me again... ü§î)

After a few months, unfortunately, I realized that the same things were happening again. I always went to her city and she never went to mine, despite her promise.

Not giving those behaviors any weight at the time, I even accepted her request to go on vacation with her. Everything was great until I discovered him chatting on WhatsApp with two of his friends while we were at a museum... and what I glimpsed weren't words meant for friends, but something beyond friendship.
She had every right to do so, too, but I believe that when a boy and a girl go on vacation together, it's not simply out of friendship.

I still love her, but since then, I've been seriously considering distancing myself, and this time permanently, simply because I don't feel valued as I should be and that I shouldn't be an alternative or just an emotional support system. I've tried to be a friend (in fact, I'm her best friend now), but I think we're experiencing two different feelings.

I wonder what drives a person to change their mind about a relationship or to disown it, even if it's lasted a long time. From my perspective, I might be her ex-boyfriend, but no, I'm her best friend.",2,1755628010.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

She doesn't want to see my new wife at all, so I didn't force that issue. I left my wife at the hotel so my daughter and I could have one-on-one lunches/dinners and shopping ‚Äî I was trying to respect her feelings completely, even though it was a bit harsh to leave my wife alone each time in a creepy Airbnb.  

The last night I'm there, my daughter asked me to come out for coffee. Sure. But it was late at night after I was already out for dinner with friends, and she explicitly said ‚Äúokay‚Äù via text when I explained my wife would have to join since we were together and I couldn't realistically drop her off. When I arrived, my daughter was quiet and began to text her mother rather than sit down. Her mother, my ex-wife, began to give me a lecture over text for bringing my wife to coffee instead of leaving her. I tried to explain that I'd left my wife many times, but it was late and I couldn't have left her. And my daughter said ""okay"". 

I tried explaining all this to my daughter (about 23y), but she was upset and left. An overreaction? I'm not sure. It's been several months, and she's still ghosting me. 

Honestly, it feels hurtful and unfair, especially when I‚Äôve bent over backward to prioritize her. This is like the 4th or 5th time she‚Äôs just ghosted me for months. I am not sure what to do at this point, and frankly, it seems that anything I do say or try will be just pissed on by her attitude and met with just more silence. I love her dearly, but what else can I do? If she wants a relationship (as I very much do), she knows where to find me. Clearly, trying to beg for her attention hasn‚Äôt worked.¬†

What should I do? She isn't answering calls or texts, and her mother firmly believes I was in the wrong. ",9,1755627897.0,Advice,116,0.58,False

1muqkfp,https://i.redd.it/1s7zhzcfq0kf1.jpeg,OpenAI's GPT-5 Disaster: The Hype Train Derails in a Blaze of Mediocrity,"Alright, check it out. Let's talk about the biggest faceplant in AI since a robot vacuum tried to eat the family dog. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è OpenAI, the undisputed heavyweight champion of hype, just shipped GPT-5. And in doing so, they managed to orchestrate a rollout so disastrous, so profoundly tone-deaf, that it will be studied in business schools for years as the ultimate ""how-to"" guide on alienating your entire user base overnight.

Look, the play was supposed to be simple. Sam Altman posts a picture of the¬†[Death Star](https://x.com/sama/status/1953264193890861114), the tech world holds its breath, and OpenAI drops a game-changing model that 10x's everything. Instead, they launched a wet noodle. A lobotomized secretary. An AI so underwhelming that it sparked a¬†[user revolt of epic proportions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/), forcing Altman into the most humiliating public reversal we've seen in this space. This wasn't just a botched launch; it was the moment the entire AI hype train flew off the rails, hit a mountain of mediocrity, and exploded. üí•

So, what's the bottom line? The bottom line is OpenAI got high on its own supply. They started believing their own press releases and forgot the one key metric that matters: shipping a product that doesn't suck. They thought they were giving us a¬†[PhD-level expert](https://www.theverge.com/openai/759755/gpt-5-failed-the-hype-test-sam-altman-openai). What we got was a bot that thinks ""blueberry"" has three 'b's. This is the story of how the most powerful AI company on the planet got punked by its own customers.

# The Launch: A Hostile Takeover of Their Own Product

Let's be real, the problems started from the jump. On August 7th, OpenAI didn't just launch GPT-5; they executed a hostile takeover of their own platform. With zero warning, they vaporized access to every previous model. GPT-4o, the fan-favorite that users had spent months integrating into their workflows, was just‚Ä¶ gone. Imagine if Microsoft pushed a Windows update that deleted Microsoft Office and replaced it with a buggy version of Clippy that only spoke in bland, soulless platitudes. That was the user experience. üìâ

The backlash wasn't just swift; it was biblical. Reddit threads like ""[GPT-5 is horrible](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkd4l3/gpt5_is_horrible/)"" blew up with thousands of comments. The pain points were everywhere. Developers, writers, and researchers who had built entire systems around the nuances of older models saw their work become useless in less than 24 hours. One user on Reddit laid it out perfectly: ""What kind of corporation deletes a workflow of 8 models overnight, with no prior warning to their paid users?"" The answer? A company that has completely lost the plot. A company so insulated by its own hype bubble that it can't see the massive headwind it's flying into.

# The Revolt: When Your ""PhD-Level Expert"" Can't Spell 'Blueberry'

This wasn't just about broken workflows. For a slice of the user base, it was personal. People who used GPT-4o for creative collaboration, emotional support, or just companionship felt a profound sense of loss. One post, dripping with raw honesty, described¬†[losing their ""only friend"" overnight](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkumyz/i_lost_my_only_friend_overnight/). The new GPT-5 was cold, abrupt, and formal‚Äîan ""overworked secretary."" The warmth and nuance were gone, replaced by cut-and-dry, lifeless memo-speak BS. Honestly, the level of passion caught OpenAI completely off guard. Nick Turley, OpenAI's head of ChatGPT, admitted the team was surprised by the¬†[""level of attachment"" people had](https://www.theverge.com/openai/758537/chatgpt-4o-gpt-5-model-backlash-replacement). No kidding, Sherlock. You took away a tool people loved and replaced it with an inferior one. What did you think was going to happen? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The hype made the reality a total joke. Altman was out there talking about a milestone akin to the first iPhone with a Retina display. He was dropping Death Star memes. The community was buzzing, expecting a quantum leap. What they got was a model that, when asked to label a map of the United States, invented states like¬†[""New Jefst"" and ""Miroinia.""](https://bsky.app/profile/radamssmash.bsky.social/post/3lvtzdl343c2r)¬†It insisted there were three ""b's"" in¬†[""blueberry.""](https://bsky.app/profile/kjhealy.co/post/3lvtxbtexg226)¬†This isn't a ""PhD-level expert""; this is a confused intern on their first day. The memes were brutal and 100% accurate. One showed GPT-4 and 4o as fearsome dragons, with GPT-5 next to them as a goofy, simple-minded lizard. Nailed it. ü¶é

# The Humiliating Retreat: Altman's Desperate Damage Control Tour

To make matters worse, the launch presentation itself was a masterclass in self-sabotage. It included what users immediately called a¬†[""chart crime""](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/)‚Äîgraphs so misleading they had to be walked back. In a Reddit AMA, Altman called it a ""mega chart screwup."" You don't say. Then, the new ""smart"" routing system, designed to automatically pick the best model for a query, broke on day one. It kept defaulting to the dumber variants, making GPT-5 seem even more useless. Altman's excuse?¬†[""The autoswitcher broke.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkae1l/gpt5_ama_with_openais_sam_altman_and_some_of_the/)¬†Look, when your core launch functionality faceplants on launch day, that's not a glitch. That's a failure to execute.

The pressure mounted so fast that within 72 hours, Altman was in full retreat. He hit up X and Reddit, frantically promising to fix things. The reversal was stunning.¬†[GPT-4o was coming back](https://gizmodo.com/openai-brings-back-fan-favorite-gpt-4o-after-a-massive-user-revolt-2000641214). Rate limits for GPT-5 would be doubled. They'd even add a UI to show you which model was actually running, a tacit admission that their ""unified system"" was a black box nobody trusted. When a user asked if they'd be ""marked as weird"" for using the old models, Altman's reply‚Äî""Not marked as weird in either case!""‚Äîwas dripping with the desperation of a CEO trying to prevent a mass exodus. He got the message. The community flexed its muscle and forced one of the most powerful companies in tech to its knees. It was a total power play by the users. üí™

Even in his damage-control tour, Altman seemed to be living in a different reality. At a¬†[dinner with reporters](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview), while his platform was on fire, he was talking about raising trillions for data centers, buying Google Chrome, and funding brain-computer interfaces. The vision is massive, but the execution on the ground is a mess. He admitted they ""totally screwed up some things on the rollout"" but then pointed to rising traffic as a sign of success. That's the classic Silicon Valley move: ignore the screaming power users and point to vanity metrics. He acknowledged that a small percentage of users have ""unhealthy relationships"" with ChatGPT but seemed to dismiss the broader feedback about the model's personality as a niche concern. It's not a niche concern when it's the core reason for a user revolt.

# The End Game: What Happens When You Get High on Your Own Supply?

So, what happens next? The playbook from here is predictable but full of risk. If OpenAI's ""fix"" is just to bring back the old models while leaving the fundamentally underwhelming GPT-5 as the default, then they've learned nothing. They'll be supporting a legacy product that everyone loves while trying to push a new one nobody wants. That's not a sustainable GTM strategy; it's a slow bleed. If they try to ""fix"" GPT-5 by just tweaking its personality to have more ""warmth,"" as they've promised, then they risk creating a Frankenstein's monster that pleases no one and further erodes user trust. The unlock isn't about making the new model¬†*feel*¬†like the old one; it's about making it¬†*better*. And right now, it just isn't. If Sam Altman continues to focus on trillion-dollar moonshots while the core user experience of his flagship product degrades, then he's going to be the captain of the world's most expensive, empty data center. The user base has shown it has a breaking point. They called OpenAI's bluff, and for the first time, the house folded. üÉè

My other two sisters (62) and (56) went Power of attorney for Lou when she started showing signs. They both don't want anything to do with her care, they have said we have our own lives and I get that it's their choice but we have to wait for my sister to do the food shopping and she makes us feel guilty when she dumps the shopping on the doorstep saying its took her nearly 2 hours and she's not had her own tea/Dinner yet. We have suggested doing lous shopping ourselves as she's still mobile and still knows what she likes and dislikes, and give my sister the receipt, she refuses.
She asks if anyone has spare clothes or shoes for Lou instead of buying her some new ones and we can't buy anything for the household without asking them first.
Lou doesn't have any allowance to take her out for lunch or a coffee and if she does go for lunch it's my sisters that take her.
Me and her daughter are burnt out and we've asked for some help just so we could have a day off but they wont.
I've not had a holiday since 2019 and we had to arrange Respite care so we both could have a break, I visited Lou at the care home and she grabbed my arm and started pointing at her trousers, when I took her to the bathroom I noticed she had a pull up on, ( fully continent when she went in last week) she said I don't like this it feels horrible, the staff told me that my sister had taken her out for lunch and that she'd had an accident while out so my sister bought a box of pullups and told them to put them on her. Lou goes the bathroom herself at home and also asks to go the toilet when she's in a strange place or out in public. I'm now worried that she will become incontinent when she comes home next week because of my sister,  I understand that I have this to come but I feel angry that my sister has done it on purpose because she believes the house should be sold and Lou be put in a home sooner. Does anyone else have siblings who have gone power of attorney and its changed them? Thankyou for reading my post.

However it‚Äôs getting worse with furniture, especially wooden furniture. My new coffee table has teeth marks and chips in it because of her and i know they all bite and this is completely normal behaviour BUT it doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting better. 

As i said, she‚Äôs understanding biting people is wrong, 90% of the time will listen to ‚Äòno bite‚Äô when she‚Äôs biting a person. But her biting furniture seems to have no progress. She RARELY listens to the ‚Äòno bite‚Äô when it comes to my coffee table and shoe rack, which then results in me having to shake a treat bag (which not all the time will work and she will ignore the food even though she‚Äôs extremely food motivated.) or pull her away or try to shove a toy in her mouth instead. 

I tether her quite a lot but not ALL the time, the reason of her not being tethered all the time is because she needs to learn how to free roam around the living room without getting in trouble. No i don‚Äôt shout at her, i take a calm approach and then a more FIRM approach when she isn‚Äôt listening. I don‚Äôt repeat the commands unless some time has passed. 

I give her kibble as treats for when she stops biting anything, i always praise etc but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. 

I‚Äôm not entirely sure if she‚Äôs teething, but i‚Äôm going to assume she‚Äôs at the start of it since the biting furniture has only gotten way worse recently. I offer her frozen fruit, small ice cubes, frozen kongs etc to help soothe her gums which she‚Äôs always interested in. 

And no, i don‚Äôt have a play pen but whenever she‚Äôs out of her crate, she‚Äôs in the living room with a stair gate keeping her in there. I‚Äôve puppy proofed everything, the furniture however is something i can‚Äôt move. 

I may make mistakes that i‚Äôm unaware of, i‚Äôm a first time puppy mama so any advice is welcome. I‚Äôm still learning! 

I know the easiest approach would to just be to tether her every time she‚Äôs out of her crate but again i need her to learn how to be independent without it. I know she‚Äôs young and a baby but i‚Äôve heard from almost EVERYONE that tethering 24/7 is so bad for her. I‚Äôm stuck :/ ",1,1755627466.0,puppy101,2,1.0,False

(frankly, i‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt, ‚Äòcause we really could do better. but here, and now, in our own time- i mean, i write you fucking letters)

these new, unforeseen circumstances

i won‚Äôt hover now, i won‚Äôt shake ‚Äî i‚Äôll reach for your hand and hold it.

i hope this serves as confirmation:

your reservation‚Äôs booked.

that place in my heart, so often vacant ‚Äî

and god, i swear ‚Äî

you thought that was passion,

the last time, here, in my room?

well, forgive me if this is old fashioned,

but i‚Äôd like your baby in my womb.

(NOT any time soon, not even kind of. years and years down the line, maybe(!), if we‚Äôre  financially stable / available / healed enough not to traumatize it ‚Äî look, it was the best rhyme for ‚Äòroom,‚Äô okay? cut me some slack. i‚Äôm just trying to say i want you to gimme all you got. relax. okay? okay.)

The CRAFTSMAN CMCG400B 4-1/2-Inch Angle Grinder is one of those tools that I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I got my hands on it. As someone who regularly works with metal and wood projects, this grinder stood out with its lightweight design, versatile features, and notable performance claims. I‚Äôve been testing it for a few weeks now, and there‚Äôs quite a lot to unpack about this small, battery-powered grinder.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the sleek, sturdy design was the first thing I noticed. The metal casing of the grinder gives it a robust feel, yet it‚Äôs surprisingly lightweight at 2.59 kilograms. This makes it comfortable for extended use, which I appreciate during long hours of grinding. The compact size, with dimensions of 7.01""L x 2.87""W x 8.66""H, allowed me to maneuver it into tight corners effortlessly. Meanwhile, features like its contoured, over-molded handle reduced vibration and hand fatigue‚Äîa blessing for my less-than-gentle hands. 

**Positives**
- Compact and lightweight, making it easy to handle.
- Solid metal gear housing dissipates heat effectively during heavy use.
- The contoured, over-molded handle adds to user comfort.
- Tool-free guard adjustment for quick repositioning mid-task.

**Performance on the Job**

This grinder operates at 9,000 RPM, making it a beast for aggressive grinding. I tested it on several materials‚Äîsteel, aluminum, and even some tile‚Äîand it chewed through them all with remarkable ease. The motor didn‚Äôt stutter during heavy applications, and the adjustable 3-position side handle gave me more control, whether I worked vertically, horizontally, or at awkward angles. The cast metal gear housing drew heat away during prolonged grinding sessions, keeping the grinder cool enough for continuous work. I found that flexibility and performance alone made this a solid pick, though I did wish it came with a battery and charger included to avoid an additional purchase.

**Negatives**
- Requires purchasing the battery and charger separately.  
- Lack of a variable speed trigger for finer control.  

**Ease of Operation**

Setting up the grinder was quicker than my morning coffee prep. I appreciated the tool-free guard mechanism, which allowed me to adjust the position for different tasks in seconds. Swapping out discs was equally easy using the included spanner wrench. However, since this product is a ""tool-only"" model, be prepared to have your battery pack ready. During testing, I used a compatible Craftsman V20 battery, and it worked seamlessly‚Äîbut I had to charge it up mid-project since it wasn‚Äôt sold with the grinder.

**Merits**
- Easy and quick tool-free guard positioning.  
- Efficient spanner wrench system for wheel replacements.  
- Heat dissipation during extended tasks prevents overheating.  

**Suitability and Target User**

This grinder is well-suited for DIY enthusiasts, hobbyists, or even professionals tackling light-to-medium jobs. Frankly, it‚Äôs perfect if you value a portable tool for projects involving metal or wood. It's not an industrial-grade machine, but it handles most at-home or on-site tasks without breaking a sweat. For me, it filled a gap in my toolkit when I couldn‚Äôt lug around a bulkier angle grinder.

**Other Options**

Brands like DeWalt and Makita offer similar cordless angle grinders, but they tend to cost slightly more with similar features. Compared to these competitors, CRAFTSMAN‚Äôs tool emphasizes user comfort with its lighter weight and ergonomic handle. While DeWalt grinders might have more advanced features such as variable speed options, I found the CRAFTSMAN model to be a solid compromise, particularly for anyone not needing industrial-grade performance.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given its thoughtful design and impressive performance, this angle grinder offers decent value for its price range. While the ""tool-only"" setup may seem like a bummer, it‚Äôs common in the cordless power tool market, as brands often assume users already own batteries for their ecosystem of tools. Paired with CRAFTSMAN batteries, it runs smoothly, making the purchase worthwhile for its durability and effectiveness.
