I don’t really know why I’m writing this here. Maybe I just need people to know my story exists. Maybe I’m tired of keeping it all inside.)
Hi everyone,
My name is Avi. I’m 16 years old, writing to you from Muzaffarnagar, UP.
While you are building your lives in the UK or the US, I am fighting just to start mine.
When I was 13, I was diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia. It’s a rare condition where the body stops making enough blood cells. Overnight, I went from being a normal kid excited about high school to someone needing weekly blood transfusions and heavy immunosuppressants just to survive.
I was learning to deal with that. I was tough. But then, September 2024 happened.
The Accident.
I was in a severe car crash. My right thigh bone shattered. My right shin fractured. My left arm broke. Because of my blood disorder, doctors couldn't perform standard surgery—I would have bled out. Instead, they used external fixators. I currently have metal rods sticking out of my body, holding my bones together from the outside.
It has been over a year now. My bones still haven't healed. I am bedridden.
I watch my friends on Instagram posting about school, tuition, hanging out at cafes, living normal teenage lives. And I’m just... here. In the same bed. Every single day. To make matters worse, I recently tested positive for Hepatitis C—likely from one of the many blood transfusions I’ve needed.
Why I’m posting here:
My family is middle-class, and the medical bills for three simultaneous conditions (The Blood Disorder + The Orthopedic Injuries + Hepatitis C) are crushing us. We have exhausted everything.
I'm not writing this for pity. I’m writing this because I want to fight. I want to walk again. I want to finish 11th grade. I want to make my parents proud.
I have started a fundraiser on Ketto to help cover my surgeries and medicines. I know the currency is different where you are—$10 or £10 might be a coffee for you, but converted to Rupees, it can buy me a day's worth of essential medicine.
If you can support a young student back home, or even just upvote this for visibility, it would mean the world to me.

I just got this cup and saucer that was originally bought by my grandfather in the mid-1940s at the Szaberplac on Grunwaldzki Place in Wroclaw, Poland.  My parents told me there were 2 of them (one got lost or damaged during a move) and that he used to call it antique back then, but without any details. 

There are numbers on the cup but no maker's marks, and no marks on the saucer. The blue and white dots are textured (bumpy to touch). It's a small cup, the size I've had in restaurants serving Turkish coffee.

1pyqch3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyqch3,Thank you!,"A year of words, coffee, wine, and a whole lot of gratitude. 

​Looking back at these numbers, I’m honestly a bit speechless. As an indie author who only started publishing this year, I never imagined that my stories would reach this many eyes. To see 111,997 pages read and 4,607 units processed is a dream come true.
​But beyond the data, I want to send a message to my fellow indie authors who are just starting out: Please don’t give up.

​It’s easy to get discouraged when you see a 1-star rating or a review that feels a bit sharp. But remember:
• ​Not every book is for every reader. Your ""not for me"" is someone else’s favorite story.
• ​We are human. If a review points out a typo or a mistake, take it as a lesson, but don't beat yourself up. Perfection is the enemy of progress.
• ​Someone is waiting for your words. Keep writing. Keep hitting publish. Every page read is a connection made. 

Thank you to everyone who took a chance on my books this year. I can’t wait to show you what’s coming in 2026!

No one is perfect. Not me, nor my wife.

I, 31M, and my wife, 27F, have been together for 8 years, going on 9. We have been married for 3. We have two small children, one is <2 years old and the other <4 months old. 

My wife Nickie is a stay at home mom. She is a great mom, she takes care of the kids and the dog (who has chronic allergies due to the breed) and even breast feeds our baby. She does this while I work three-four nights a week 7pm-7am shifts which involves me leaving the house around 5:30pm and arriving back around 8am the next morning. 

Upon arriving home I usually get our oldest baby ready for the day, dress the baby, make breakfast for us all, clean up the mess, and the mess from the night before. I take out the trash, and make her coffee if she hasn't for herself already. 

For the better part of a year, Nickie has been telling me to quit the job that is tough, but I love, so I can relocate to another facility to work a different shift, and has been begging me to switch to days. I really didn't want to as it's much better financially working nights. I'm a disabled veteran and working my butt off to make ends meet. But I told management I wanted a switch and they were awesome about it and will switch me in a few months...

For a little context on out relationship: 

I grew up very poor. She grew up very very wealthy. Every child in her large family has received a full paid education, new vehicle(s), businesses paid for, and a starter house paid for (<250,000 each). The best I got as a young adult was a $100 bill which was huge for me. 

She rented out her starter home until selling it to buy a different rental property. She had me do all the labor as I'm very handy. She paid off $30,000 of credit card debt after selling this second one and paid for her own $60,000 SUV which she loves.

I am very happy that she was able to do that. I wish I had that as a kid. 

We had a starter home that I paid for that was like $200,000. I felt unsafe there and wanted to move. I told her to pick a house within reason, and we could move exactly where she wanted. She wanted this half a million dollar home that we currently live in (for the last two years). Now she says it's not near enough things to do. She says the inconvenience of driving 20+ minutes anywhere (other than groceries, multiple pools, multiple gyms, and multiple fast food options that are within the neighborhood) is killing her. Making her brutally depressed. This is a newer home that we got a good rate on. The community is still developing. Now she wants a $700,000+ home that's over 50 years old, needs work, is way over budget for someone who is already way over budget with their current home.

The way she acts towards me makes me feel like I am not doing enough for her. She says we don't travel enough; but we go places all the time. Georgia, Tennessee, Tampa, Zoos, Hotels, Spa days, Massages, to name a few. Her family no longer funds anything. The house, cars, and education is the deal to start their lives. 

I have mentioned multiple times to her feeling like our relationship is strained after multiple falling outs over me being the one to take care of the house, groceries, cars, garage, trash, laundry, dishes, cooking, etc while her only responsibility she cares to do most days is the two kids and the dog. Not saying she doesn't clean or do these things period. She does order groceries and does clean up sometimes for sure! Its just not consistent. She never really did these things growing up and had limited responsibilities. 

I understand that being a stay at home mom is difficult. However, when she went out of town for several days, I was able to manage the children, the home, the laundry, grocery shopping, etc. just fine on my own. It's tough but doable. 

I have mentioned wanting a divorce to her multiple times and really feel run down in the relationship. I don't get in the bed until 11am or later some days and wake up at 4:45pm to get ready to work 12+ hour overnight shift.

Upon my final day of working for the week, I will sleep for 2-4 hours, wake up, cater to the needs of the family and house, and go to bed around 11pm to get up around 7am to care for our oldest child.

Currently I am brutally ill with the flu. Our oldest recently finished antibiotics from being ill, and Nickie is still currently taking them since she wasn't feeling well last week. 

With that being said, I was febrile, exhausted, and having some GI upset. So I was still in bed. I slept for 30 hours two days ago, and called off work. Nickie checked on me and made sure I was drinking water and asked if I wanted to go to the ER multiple times. It was nice.

Today, I was trying to sleep some more. Around 8:30am she came in and was shaking me, telling me to wake up and that I told her to wake me up. I don't recall doing that. So let's just assume I did. 

I couldn't really get the strength to tell her to stop right away, so she just get pushing me in bed until I begged her to stop.

Then around 9:30am she did it again telling me that we need to go to the circus with our <2 year old child and small baby because we haven't done enough recently. Mind you, it's the holidays, we spent the holidays with her family, we drove around town looking at lights, went to the zoo an hour away to look at their lights well past our child's bedtime, and that was just a few days ago. 

I expressed to her that I was very ill and am shaking in weakness. I asked her to stop and she slammed the bedroom door. It took me 10 minutes, but I got out of bed and helped her to the car with the children. She was upset with me saying that I told her to wake me up and that we need to go do something.

Their car seats were in my truck when I helped her outside, but we opened her car. I went and grabbed my keys, started my truck for them, and she started yelling ""I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MOVE THEIR SEATS"". I said ""I STARTED THE TRUCK FOR YOU"". I put our oldest in the truck, she put the youngest in. Then I went inside.

She chased after me and said ""what no kiss?"" So I kiss her, and she says ""I love you"" 

Sick or not, I work nights, I work a very difficult job, and she runs me into the ground to the point I'm sitting here vomiting and shaking from the lethargy and dehydration just trying to see if I am overreacting by strongly considering a divorce again over this continued issue. 

Even last night she said ""if you're feeling better tomorrow we should get an Air BnB in the mountains in North Carolina or something since you don't have to work until Friday!""

Today I randomly decided to check in because he posted me recently and told me a lot of his friends were congratulating him. I login and see the said compliments until I noticed he has a DM history with his female coworker that I was slightly worried about and told him so (she’s a very pretty girl and is about the only one in his part time). He only mentions how other guys at work are actively trying to pursue her because she is objectively attractive but he reassured me that he only has eyes for me. 

I scroll through their convo and it’s invasive I know, but i realized they talk more often than he does with his best friend. They send each other reels and have this weird insult-banter thing where they call each other names, and she always texts first asking him if he can go to the gym with her because she needs a “spot” which didn’t alarm me at first because i was dumb enough to think she meant parking spot until she kept saying she wanted him to spot her for lifts and such. He agrees sometimes and goes, other times he can’t and she does that weird insult banter thing. She also gets him coffee before she clocks in shifts with him and sends him pics she takes of him whenever she sees him around the area. His manager at work also ships the both of them and keeps trying to set them up with same shifts (that’s what he told me)

I feel like a big factor in me being slightly alarmed was that him and I also met through working at this same place so we were also just once coworkers.

Is this behavior weird or purely platonic? I feel like I trust him enough to know he won’t do anything like that but I also think it’s weird that he didn’t bother to mention that he goes to the gym with her especially when he lets me know when he goes to the gym with other people (his guy friends).

This was a month ago and we haven’t spoken again since. It was super awkward to meet in person and I’m not sure why. Have been friends for 15 years.

One of them we stopped speaking because of something she did and I told her I needed some space and I would love to talk about it - this was 7 months ago. I’ve been avoiding it. Have known her for almost 20 years. 

Third one I feel comfortable letting it go as I think the friendship had run its course. We were friends for 10 years.

I have a pattern of ghosting in friendships  and don’t do it anymore and am aware of my patterns.  But avoidance is obviously still huge for me. 

I keep hearing stories about people who had friendship breaks and then felt closer and deepened the friendship after conflict. I’m not sure I ever experienced this so would love to hear about times when it led to something good. Feeling quite sad about these friendships now at the end of the year.

run down for whoever is in the same boat cuz i struggled af. Basically a coffee grinder is used to
turn whole coffee beans into the right size grounds for brewing. So youll need one whenever
you want fresh coffee because pre ground coffee loses flavor quickly.
Also theyre used with espresso machines, pour over setups, AeroPress, french press, so any
method that requires ground beans. jbtw grind size and consistency directly affect how your
coffee tastes so its imp. Mentioning a few factors based on which i got mine on.
* Blade vs. burr: Blade grinders chop beans unevenly which leads to inconsistent
extraction. Burr grinders (conical or flat) crush beans uniformly so more consistent flavor
* Grind range: should be able to handle very fine to very coarse grinds.
* Adjustability: More grind settings let you fine tune for different brew methods.
* Capacity & speed: Smaller grinders are fine for one or two cup, but bigger batches
require either a larger hopper or multiple rounds.
* Ease of use & cleaning: Removable burrs or simple designs make cleanup easy.
Coffee grounds are messy, so easy maintenance really matters for daily use.
Personally i like [this kind](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO1375) cuz theyre

I ask them to do things, ya know, because I am their CLIENT that has paid them handsomely and it is like babysitting half the time. I have to check in that they did it, I have to ask for proof (did not originally but I have learned from experience), and so often I am met with a resistance/avoidance to do simple reason things on my behalf - like contacting the opposing counsel to have a conversation so we can negotiate and stop dragging this miserable process out.

It's like they think they are in charge. The most recent frustration is I asked to meet face to face with my new attorney in his ""office"" listed on his website. I am done with this phone and facetime existence. I want to see who you are in the real world, see your body language, see if you can look me in the eye when you are promising something.

  
He agreed on a time one afternoon and I left work early using an hour of sick time. He said he was running late. I said I'll wait at a coffee shop down the road. He eventually said he wasn't going to make it between then and the class he had to teach. I said, fine, another time. 

Turns out HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT OFFICE ANYMORE. He has it listed on Google and on his personal site. He never once mentioned that he was now virtual, working from home. 

I wasted my afternoon and took an hour of sick time and he never had the integrity to simply tell me, he closed that office!

  
There have been several other things he said he was gonna do and then he just doesn't. I ask him for proof he attempted it and he ignores me or lies again. One thing he finally admitted after he could not get out it, however.

  
I want to demand a refund. I paid him flat up front instead of retainer since I can't stand the nickle and dime BS from other attorney's with retainers and this seems to have been a bad idea too.

  
I want to threaten to file a complaint over the office and few other things unless he gives me my money back. The agreement was to get me through pre-trial and negotiate a deal before going to trial if necessary.

I (22M) have a date with (25M) tomorrow and it’s my first ever date. Signed up to Facebook Dating a few days ago and straight away started chatting with him and he asked me out. He keeps calling me cute and handsome haha.

1. Should I tell him that I’m not out to my family and that it’s my first ever date with a guy? Or should that wait for a future date?
2. What level of affection is expected given that it’s a first date? A hug and/or kiss before the date? Or after? Or nothing?
3. From looking at his Instagram, his political views are very different to mine. (He doesn’t know mine). Should I bring this up only if he asks? (Politics is not a dealbreaker for me)
4. How long should I stay for the coffee date? Like after how long would it be acceptable for me to leave and not rude?

Ever feel like your savings are just… sitting there? Like a forgotten gym membership, they’re doing *something*, but not nearly enough? What if I told you that with a few tweaks, your money could work harder than you do?

Here’s the truth: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They think retirement is a distant dream, but the real magic happens when you *optimize* what you already have.

### **3 Ways Your Savings Could Be Secretly Supercharged**
1. **The Compound Interest Snowball**
   - A single $100 investment at 7% annual return becomes **$761 in 30 years**—without lifting a finger.
   - *Pro tip:* Even small, consistent contributions turn into a financial avalanche over time.

2. **The ""Invisible"" Money Leaks**
   - That daily coffee? $5 x 365 = **$1,825/year**—enough to fund a mini-vacation (or invest).
   - Cutting just *one* unnecessary expense could fast-track your goals.

3. **The Retirement Multiplier**
   - Your 401(k) or IRA isn’t just a savings account—it’s a **tax-advantaged growth machine**.
   - Example: $500/month at 8% return = **$750K+ in 30 years**. (Yes, really.)

### **The Big Question: Are You Leaving Money on the Table?**
Most people don’t realize how much their savings *could* grow with the right strategy. **You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb).

# Running Art Exhibits

  


[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Art Exhibition — Human Landscapes, the Mystery of the Mark**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/human-landscapes-the-mystery-of-the-mark/) at **NCCU Art Museum**

* North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Eric Kelly Museum are proud to announce a major exhibition celebrating the extraordinary work of NCCU alumnus Dr. Eric A.W. Kelly III, founder of the Kelly Worldwide advertising and marketing Agency and Director of Eric Kelly III Museum, and one of the most transformative abstract expressive artists of our time. Running from October 23, 2025, through January 4, 2026, the exhibition, Human Landscapes: The Mystery of the mark, presents a groundbreaking fusion of color, sound, and emotional storytelling through more than 50 paintings spanning seven decades of artistic mastery. In this groundbreaking exhibit, Dr. Kelly will be showing some of his early masterpieces from his days at NCCU, leading up to his present style called neo-abstract expressive.
* Dr. Eric Kelly III’s visionary style—marked by bold black lines, synesthetic color experiences, and deeply expressive portraiture—has shaped a new visual language that bridges abstraction and identity. A 1982 graduate of NCCU’s Visual Communications program and the university’s first Art Scholarship recipient, Dr. Kelly returns to his alma mater to debut a multisensory journey that explores the human condition through dynamic compositions, vivid colors, original music scores, and shares his new movie documentary “Human Landscapes” during the exhibition.
* This event is free and open to the public. RSVP FOR ART TOURS 919-308-9090
* October 22- January 4

I was trying my best to finish the cinnamon roll and lemon cold brew and I heard someone shout something so loudly, repeatedly. 

It took me a while to realize it was LMAO. I have heard people say LOL out loud and even ROFL but it's really the first time I heard someone say LMAO. A whole group was laughing and one guy was actually saying LMAO out loud.

I just sat there for a moment thinking, wow, this is new to me. I have used it in messages since forever but hearing someone actually say it was crazy. At least LOL has some plausible deniability as a sound. LMAO is just very, WEIRDLY specific.

Instead of finishing the so called amazing lemon cold brew, I started wondering if we have words like this in Telugu, like internet slang that people casually say in conversation without really thinking about where it came from.

The reality is squeezing in that bubble bath between wrapping gifts at midnight and making cupcakes for tomorrow's school party that was somehow forgotten until tonight.

But completely ignoring basic health backfires. When parents are skipping meals or running on empty, it’s often harder to stay patient and grounded. More impatient, more overwhelmed, zero capacity for inevitable holiday meltdowns. Basic self-maintenance isn't indulgent; it's necessary infrastructure for getting through December.

Some non-negotiables that actually matter: taking daily vitamins even when skipping meals, drinking actual water instead of just coffee, and protecting 7 hours for sleep at least 5 nights a week. Not Pinterest-perfect self-care, but sustainable basics that maintain function. Magnesium and B vitamins especially play a role in supporting the body's normal energy production and stress response.

That said, been trying to get out and find ways to make more friends. So far this includes: a really weird book club interaction (TL;DR I was not the demographic they were expecting), reconnecting with an ex that is now committed to being my ""life coach"", and burning a bridge with an old high-school friend by absent mindedly bringing up the topic of religion during a coffee chat.

If any of this resonates with you, please feel free to shoot me a message and let's trauma bond over awkward adult social interactions!

My family is trying to plan our first extended vacation with young kids and Copenhagen has caught our attention as an option. We’re planning to travel for the month of August and would like to stay in one location maybe with a few day or overnight trips. Our kids will be 3 and 6 when we travel. We’re drawn to Copenhagen because it seems accessible in many ways - most people speak English, there is a good transportation system and walkable neighborhoods. We want to pick a place that has plenty of kid friendly cultural attractions and outdoor spaces and that we can just find a harmonious summer routine grabbing coffee at a cafe walking to a local park throughout the month. We’d love to know the best neighborhoods to stay, where to find a house to rent, if finding a nanny/ babysitter is an option, activities/ ways for the kids to make friends, and even if this is a suitable city for our needs.

in the past I’ve struggled but not as much as I am now. when I was growing up I’d go to scool and not eat at school hardly ever. There was always one food in the entire mea selection I would eat whenever it was offered all throughout my grade school career and that was it and usually only offer once a month. theb I’m high school on days when I was desperate for food if buy cheese it’s and a soda at the school store and that was it, all I ever felt like eating by my own willpower was cheese it’s. 

while staying with family I was able to eat normally though i got full very quickly due to not typically eating balanced meals. I basically canibly force myself to eat my safe foods, even then actually getting the motivation to eat them is hard (literally doing it as I write this)

  
I’ve also noticed with liquids, every drink I enjoy has been tasting bad for some reason. I really struggle to drink water, it makes me feel sick a lot of the time so I try to drink other things like diet soda, coffee sometimes tea or just regular soda. I had to stop drinking coffee though decayed it was tasting and feeling weird, I thought maybe there was something wrong with my coffee pot but now other things like soda and milk are also getting weird. Plus some foods like eggs and grits (which I like the taste of but maybe the texture is irritating me?) I can still get myself to drink milk and actually want to try to get back into drinking it a lot because it make me feel less tired all the time but I am not able to go to the store a ton so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that. 

anywya I am just so frustrated with it, I am glad I finally know what it is but I still am not sure how to handle it. I’ll take any suggestions anyone has ",1,1767023223.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False

1pyphal,https://i.redd.it/k5f8xgwcy5ag1.jpeg,Rekindling my relationship with fountain pens,"As a student we were always forced to write with fountain pens.

As someone who didn't have a proper way of holding the pen and almost all available brand having this economic grip it just made my hand hurt at exams when I would write pages after pages.

The moment I graduated school I was done with fountain pens.

However, I have gotten myself a planner for this year. One that is meant to have paper that is great with fountain pens (Kinbor) and so I decided that I shalk try to rekindle my relationship with fountain pens.

I got myself a Lamy (which I also used in school) and with different ink cartridges (as we were forced to only use blue in school) and to be honest....I forget how fun it is to write with fountain pens.

I dont know if I can bring myself to use blue ink in the foreseeable future as it just reminds me of dark times (bullying, depression, covid and school in general) but I love writing with this brown ink!!! 
I already bought another Lamy with a wide nib and just bought myself a Kakuno with a fine nib!

I want to explore with inks too now that I'm allowed. Who knew that there are so many cute inks out there? I didn't even think pink inks were a thing lol

This picture has me trying out a solo journaling RPG^^ Honestly since I got my Lamy I just want to write and write, just like back in school when I would write stories instead of paying intention in class lol",10,1767022921.0,fountainpens,4,1.0,False
1pyph4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pyph4i/the_new_hybrid_is_asking_too_many_questions_part_1/,The New Hybrid is Asking Too Many Questions (Part 1),"“What is it now, Coarse?” I asked, exasperated at its incessant questioning.

“Was I … born, or made?” It asked me, its voice a low rumble, like an alligator bellow. The vibrations from its throat reverberated throughout the floor it was laying on.

“Oh god, another existential crisis.” I sighed deeply. “You were made. In a lab. Somebody messed with your DNA and gave us the burden of dealing with the fallout. Now zip it, we have a few more checks and then I can go on break.”

When I had finished the checkup, I closed up Coarse's cell, slamming the iron door shut and locking it. As I moved to exit the enclosure room, it stared at me through the iron bars of its cell. I hated when it did that. Nothing unusual, mind you, Coarse has always had a tendency to stare, I’m not sure it can help that, in all honesty. Something in its DNA made it attracted to movement. Freaked me out all the same. The lights in the sector which Coarse occupied were always a little shoddy, so occasionally there would be a flicker, making me temporarily lose sight of the beast watching me from the corner of its cell. That didn't help.

I walked down the hall to the lab, where my colleague –Dr. Patel– was looking over the data collected. “Smoke break?” She asked.

“Back in 10.” I responded, before leaving out the front door. I took long drags of my cigarette, my nerves still wired. I wished Coarse wouldn't think so much about its existence. I began to reminisce about our first meeting, and upon reflecting, I got the urge to play the recording of it, for nostalgia. I flicked my cigarette on the ground and crushed it with my heel.

“You’re back early” Dr. Patel remarked as I speed-walked through the lab.

“Still on break, just can’t smoke inside.” I said hastily, as I made my way to the other side of the room and grabbed the first tape in a series labeled “Hybrid #0016”. I slid it into our –even by the standards of that time– ancient VCR. With a heavy ku-chunk, I pushed the play button. Patel slid over, still in her rolly office chair, and I made room in front of the monitor for her.

The top of my head appeared on the screen. The cameras in all the enclosures are in the top corner looking down. We could clearly see my face and the cell bars and door behind me. Coarse was a bit obscured, it positioned itself directly under the camera, the only blindspot in the room. I suppose that should have been our first clue, in hindsight. The audio plays:

\- Tape begins -

Dr. Shah: Ok. Hybrid number Zero-Zero-One-Six … Zero-Zero? You dipshits want to make a thousand of these things? Fine. Whatever. Not my circus.

\-noises of pen scribbling on paper-

Dr. Shah:   Description: Body, large … scaly? No … rough, coarse skin. Facial features, … disturbing … guess I can’t write that, um, how about … sunken. … Other physical features, Sharp claws … on hands and feet … scaly - that one’s definitely scaly - scaly tail … Skin, grey … hair, wispy, black …

\- Pen stops scribbling -

Dr. Shah: Jesus christ, what did they splice you with? Ok, field tests. Zero-Zero-One-Six … that’s you, hey! Look at me. Thank you. Let’s start with a verbal test. Can you speak?

\- A low, guttural noise from #0016 -

Dr. Shah: Ok. So … no?

\- Another low, guttural noise from #0016, different this time, but still unintelligible -

Dr. Shah. So no.

\- Scribbling sounds as Dr. Shah continues to write on her clipboard -

Dr. Shah: … Incapable … of ... Speech-

\- A louder bellow escapes from #0016 -

\- A brief silence -

\- Scribbling sounds from Dr. Shah’s pen resumes  -

Dr. Shah: … currently.

\- tape ends -

“Sometimes I forget just how far Oh-Sixteen has come,“ Patel remarked. I nodded.

“It really has grown to be a pain in my ass.”

“Oh come now, Dr. Shah, “ Patel chuckles. “As mean as you are, you’re nicer to it now than in these recordings. Hey, which one of these tapes was it where you gave it a name?”

I ran my fingers along the series of tapes until I found the one with the correct date “this one.” I said, rewinding the old tape and replacing it with the new. Ku-chunk. We watched.

\- tape begins -

Dr. Shah: Ok. Number Zero-Zero-One-Six. Just going to do your checkup, same as always. … I wish you wouldn’t stare at me so much. Move your arm. Thank you.

\#0016: Doctor?

Dr. Shah: Yes?

\#0016: Do you feel well?

Dr. Shah: No.

\- stretch of silence -

\- and unintelligible sound emerges from #0016 -

Dr. Shah: Next human thing we gotta teach you is how to clear your throat. Your voice is as rough as your skin.

\#0016: As … coarse, yes?

Dr. Shah: Yeah. Just as coarse. Hey, Zero-Zero-One-Six is a mouthful. You can pronounce ‘coarse’, shall we call you that instead?

\#0016: I am … coarse.

Dr. Shah: You sure are.

\- Tape ends -

“Wow, you are nothing if not pragmatic,” Patel remarked upon seeing the video.

“Please.” I stood up. “It’s probably been 10 minutes, let’s run some diagnostics.” Twice a day, every day, Dr. Patel and I were responsible for collecting data on the hybrids, performing physicals, checking vitals, checking cortisol levels, jotting down any behavior that was unusual. For Coarse, I would always just report that it would stare at me, and its head would be turned in my direction from the moment I stepped into its line of sight until the moment I was out of it. Sometimes it would even hear the Enclosure Room door open, and stare at the spot I would eventually appear in. I hated the way it stared, but at least it was easy to work with. Never tried to bite or scratch me, thank God, I have run tests on how powerful those jaws are. Only problem with its jaws is that it keeps flapping them while I try to work.

Dr. Patel and I split up the work. Each day she’d do the hybrids numbered one through eight, on the right side of the enclosure room, and I took nine through sixteen on the left. I may have been stuck with Coarse, but she had to deal with the arachnid-hybrid. That prickly thing was always skittering around, looking at us with way too many eyes, eating food - its chelicerae clicking with each bite. I say I got the better deal.

With my first round of checks done for the day, Patel took her leave and began her second and final round for the day. I watched her through the security cameras in between entering the data from my round into our system. I couldn’t help but steal glances at Coarse’s feed. When no human was on its side of the Enclosure Room, it just … laid there, curled up into a crescent shape. I couldn’t tell if it was asleep or not, its eyes didn’t ever close. I felt a little uncomfortable since Coarse was staring straight that the feed, so I switch over and watched as Patel finished her first check in with #0001, the worm-hybrid.

Some time later, as I was doing my menial data entry tasks, Patel returned. “Um, Dr. Shah?” She began. I swiveled around to look at her.

“What’s up?”

“Oh-eight is … “ She gestured to the screen showing the feed of a truly pitiful creature. Its limbs were sprawled out into every corner of the cell, all eight of them.

“As tortured as ever, no doubt.”

“You’ve seen the data right? It’s only getting worse.”

“Yep. Rapidly increasing neural activity. Leading to seizures, hallucinations, and screaming fits. None of the screams are recognizable as human speech.” I recount the data Patel had documented recently. “So, what about it?” I ask, as if I didn’t already know. Dr. Patel had an annoying habit of not just coming out and saying something, so I in turn developed the habit of playing dumb until she finally asked for whatever it is she wanted from me, like an adult.

“ I believe it would be best if you could … euthanize the specimen.”

“Why me?”

“You’re better at it.”

“You won’t get any better if you don’t practice.” I tell her, while at once reluctantly, implicitly agreeing to do so as I grab my clipboard. “You there,” I pointed to one of the many aides that staffed the lab. “Grab me …” I turn to Patel “ How many hearts does an Octopus have?”

Several Aides, Dr. Patel, and myself ventured into the cell marked #0008. “Strap the arms down.” I ordered. “It has a decentralized nervous system, even when braindead it might still take a swat at you. Tie ‘em down good.” I told the aides. Once I was done criticizing each individual knot, we hooked up the heart monitor. Finally,  I began.

I announced the procedure for Patel to take down on her clipboard. “Dose is 60cc of pentobarbital.” I said, drawing the liquid into the syringe. “Concentration: 100 milligrams per.” I flicked the needle of the syringe, consolidating any air bubbles at the top. I pushed the plunger until a small drop of the viscous liquid pearled at the tip of the needle. I tilted the head of the hybrid up towards the ceiling. It doesn’t resist. They never do. “Administering.” I announced, sticking the needle into the hybrid’s jugular. The injection took longer than usual. When the dose was all out of the barrel, I stood back and observed the heart monitor.

“Ten seconds.” I announced. “Twenty.” The heart monitor kept beeping. “Thirty… Heart rate irregular.  Forty … Fifty … Sixty …” I looked at the heart monitor. “Secondary hearts  … still going. Give me ten more ccs.” I directed the aide with the vial. Shortly after administering the additional dosage, all heart activity ceased. The hybrid was gone. As if to assail any doubts, the cell soon filled with a pungent, unmistakable odor.

“Leave the arms strapped down for at least another twenty minutes.” I instructed the aides before turning to Patel. “Now for the hardest part.” I joked. Half-joked. Not really a joke. “Giving Noah the call.”

Patel let me take another smoke break after the Euthanasia. I stomped out my cigarette and finished my job, doing the second and final round for the night. I finished my checks on hybrids #0009 through #0015, which left only #0016 between me and my warm bed.

“Doctor.” It said as I rounded the corner, its voice low and throaty as always.

“Coarse.” I responded. I opened the cell door, closed it behind me, and began the routine check up, dreading what question would come from the hybrid’s mouth next. Sure enough, it had one locked and loaded.

“Later in the day … your breath has a different smell, Doctor.”

“Alright, creep.” I say, paying no mind. Animals have a heightened sense of smell, it’s normal for a hybrid to pick up on pheromones, new perfume, or whatever else. Those that can talk often point it out.

“Why?”

“Probably my cigarettes.”

“What is … cigarettes?”

“They’re these little sticks of cancer that slowly kill me. But they diminish the daily exhaustion I feel at this job, and they help me cope with the monotony of it, however slightly.”

“When you … care for us … you feel … exhaustion?” It asked, voice ragged. My working theory at the time was that it can only speak when it exhales.

“Yes. You all exhaust me, especially you, you nosy nancy.”

“I understand. … Doctor?”

“What, Coarse?”

“For what it may … be worth to you … I am always … appreciative.”

“Appreciation isn’t exactly what I’m craving here, Coarse.” I said, dismissive of its appreciation. Looking back, I certainly treated it too harshly, but perhaps that is exactly what saved me in the end. “I’m just doing my job. These check ups, caring for you, feeding you, monitoring your progress, it’s all part of the gig. Nothing personal. So spare me the appreciation.” I said, coldly at first, but as my sentiment hung in the air between us, I began to feel my emotions well up, after a brief silence I said. “And y’know what? Sometimes I don’t know why I bother. You’re just going to end up as another ‘failed’ experiment, tossed aside by the higher-ups when you’re no longer useful.” My voice began to crack, as tears pricked at the corners of my eyes.

“Perhaps. … And yet … you care anyway.” Coarse, in a matter of six words, seemed to touch my heart in that moment. The double meaning of the word ‘care’ in this context, I was sure at the time, was lost on Coarse, but not on me. I wiped my budding tears, and finished Coarse’s check up. Everything was normal. I left his cell, closing the door behind me. Before leaving, I walked to the wall of iron bars now separating us, putting my hands on two of them and leaning in slightly. “Hey, try to get some sleep okay? Dream about .. hunting small mammals, or whatever it is you dream about.”

“I do not dream, Doctor,” Coarse said as I left the Enclosure Room.

As I was about to leave, a man walked into the lab. It was none other than the director of the whole program himself, the most obnoxious and arrogant of my colleagues.

“Hello Dr. Peel, To what do I owe the pleasure?”

“That's not my name.” He says.

“I'm aware, Noah. Just having fun before you suck it all out of the room.” I said, falling into my work chair exasperated. I steeled myself for whatever condescending remark he’d make about how we failed #0008.

“We'll you're right about that. I'm here to remind you of our initiative. Your results have been … Unsatisfactory.” The way he straightened up and looked down past his nose at me made me want to feed him to the hybrids. Come to think of it, Coarse is carnivorous.

“You must have forgotten how to read, then. Especially regarding Zero-Zero-One-Six. It learned to speak in record time, and its vocabulary increases daily. It'll be smarter than you pretty soon.” I adamantly defended the work I had done with Coarse over these few weeks.

“Speech is hardly impressive these days Shah, give me something worth keeping this facility running for.” He was dismissive of me, per usual.

Despite the fury in my eyes, I resigned my mouth to speak in a level manner. “Yes, Dr. Peck.”

As he exited the lab, I groaned, grabbed my stuff, and hurried out of the lab before an aide needed my attention, or some other distraction prevented me from leaving.

The following day, I approached Coarse's cell when doing my checks, and felt … fine. No heebie-jeebies. I noticed it wasn’t staring at me. It wasn't even looking in the direction of the door. I entered the cell, closed the door, still nothing.“Coarse?” He let out a heavy sigh from his nose. “Oh good, you're alive. … Are you okay, Coarse? … I'm gonna go get Dr. Patel-”

“I am … healthy, Doctor.” It responded, stopping me in my tracks en route to exiting the cell. I was surprised by the very specific phrasing it used.

“Well that's … good.” I responded, going about the normal check up procedure. Coarse was abnormally quiet. I always thought I wanted it to just shut up, but this was too eerie. I was suddenly aware of how large Coarse really was, the sharpness of its talons, the gaze of its unblinking eyes. “You're awful quiet today. I'm glad you're okay - er, ‘healthy.”

“I am … regretful … to cause you concern. Is that the word?”

“I think you mean ‘sorry’. I'm just glad you're not dead. I need you for big things.”

“Big … Things? Bigger … than this room?”

“I mean that metaphorically.”

“What is-”

“Ugh, stop.” I let out a dry, humorless chuckle. “Seems you're back to normal. What I meant was I'm relying on you, dum dum. I think you have potential- and before you ask, it means I think you can do important things. Things other hybrids maybe can't.”

“I am … happy … To try. ”

I paused briefly, registering the words. “Good. Because we have an extra test to run through tomorrow.” I said.

“I do hope … you enjoy … your cigarettes tonight.” That took me aback.

I finished the check up and hurried back to the lab. “Dr. Patel, set up an H.B.T for Zero-Zero-One-Six for tomorrow during second check”.

“Certainly,” she said with a smile. “What's the occasion?”

“I think Coarse is a smart cookie, that's all. I want to prove it to Dr. Peck.”

“Understandable.” She nodded, long braided hair bouncing slightly against her pristine white jacket. “Would you like me to re-send the analysis of Oh-Sixteen's data to Dr. Peck as well? Perhaps he missed something when it was bundled together with fifteen other hybrids.”

“That would be lovely. Can I proofread it to see if your analysis does Coarse justice?”

She shook her head slightly with a saddened look on her face, disappointed in being unable to put me at ease. “Unfortunately, no. What we analyze at this lab is classified information. Whenever you are certified for top secret clearance I will happily show you the years of backlog, however.”

“Right, figures.” I said with a defeated sigh. “Wait, that means the aides can't help you either. You write 32 reports a day? No wonder you're here so late.”

“It's not so bad, goes by really quick once you leave and your constant complaining stops distracting me” she gave me a little wink and a smile. She's been learning how to give people shit. Mentally, I gave that one about a six, needed work.

I gave a polite chuckle anyway, to show I received it as friendly banter. “I'll just trust you, as always. Goodnight, Dr. Patel.”

“Goodnight, Dr. Shah.”

That night, I had a hard time sleeping. I kept thinking –or over-thinking– the weight of Coarse’s words. It was that night I reassessed my understanding of the hybrid’s communication methods. The long breaks in its speech were not due to physical constraints as I had assumed. Coarse was thinking. Choosing its words very carefully. What I couldn’t figure out was why: whether it was trying to say the right words, or just trying not to say the wrong ones.

The following day, after sleeping like shit, I dragged my ass into the lab. Dr. Patel tried to talk to me, I held up one finger, as I went straight to the coffee machine. She chuckled and let me be. After I’d had a few sips, I approached her desk and leaned over her shoulder at the monitor in front of her. “What’cha got?”

“Seems Oh-Sixteen had a busy night. Look at this recording.”

I about dropped my coffee. The footage Dr. Patel was showing me was insane. Some time around three or four A.M., Coarse had dug its claws into the cement bunker and started climbing around on the walls. It crawled up to the camera, and looked into the lens. At the time I was certain it was trying to discern what the purpose of this strange device was. After several minutes with no progress, it started to reach a finger out and touch it. The vent in its room then sprayed gas into the enclosure with a hydraulic hiss, startling the hybrid, who immediately climbed back down, and curled up in its favorite crescent shape. “You sprayed it?” I asked.

“Only with the sleep gas, of course. Seems like it worked, right?”

“Yeah. Looks like it did” I lied. “Is the H.B.T ready?”

“Good to go for second check” Dr. Patel handed me a folder with protocol attached. “Hope your attempts go better than mine, my talkers all suck at these.”

“Thanks, I’m starting my round now. Do you need a break first?”

The day went on as usual, until my last check of the day. When I entered the Coarse’s cell, naturally, it had questions.

“Are you well, Doctor?”

“No.” I shut the door to the cell behind me

“Exhausted?”

“Yes.” I begin my routine checks. By this point, Coarse has done these checks so many times it would actually move its limbs in ways that would help me get to where I need to get to. Saved me some time at the end of my night.

“I have been thinking, Doctor.”

“Oh boy.”

“Why are we treated this way?”

“...What? I’m sorry I don’t understand what you mean, Coarse.”

“Why … are hybrids … locked … in rooms?” It spoke methodically.

“You want to know … why we keep you locked in here? Because you’re an experiment. A test subject. You’re here to be poked and prodded as I have been doing to you twice daily your whole life. Surely you know that already.”

“Yes … I know that.” That response, for whatever reason, helped me achieve some clarity. I believe I understood. It was trying to convey more than the question itself to me, but its vocabulary was limited. My mind reeled, what other meaning could these words have?

“I’m sorry, Coarse. I don’t know what you’re asking. What you’re really asking. I doubt I'm allowed to know the answer anyway.”

“Another question, Doctor.”

“Ah, Christ.”

“Why can … some hybrids talk … while others cannot?”

A realization occurred to me at that moment, I never bothered to ask. I don’t think I ever cared. I really didn’t like Coarse’s constant probing. At first it was just annoying, now it was starting to feel like Coarse was constricting me tighter and tighter with each question asked. “Beats me.” I shrugged. “Some of them don’t even make sense. Zero-Zero-One-Four is a bird-hybrid. Birds can literally talk. IN human voices no less,“ I scoffed. “Fourteen just squawks. And pecks my hand when I try to feed him. The dumbass. Maybe Dr. Patel knows? I’ll ask her later, and let you know what she tells me.”

Some time had passed and I got up from the dirty floor, wiping my hands on the rag I always took with me on checks. “Alright, we’re done with the physical check up, but we’re doing a mental one today too.” I started rifling through the papers in the folder Dr. Patel had given me. “Okay, Coarse. This is a Human Behavioral Test. I need you to follow the instructions and respond accordingly. Remember, no tricks, got it? Just cooperate, and we’ll be done in no time.”

“I am not sure I understand the concept of a … ‘trick’, doctor. I always do as you say … do I not?”

I tried to mask my irritation. At the time all I could think was ‘this little bitch is acting coy with me. It must not have liked my previous answers to its questions.’

I answered its question. “Of course you do, Coarse. That’s why I’m asking you to behave normally during this evaluation. No … antics, got it? Just follow the instructions, and provide the responses I am looking for, understood?”

“... Understood.”

“Good. I am going to read a scenario to you, and then give you three options for how to respond. Your task is to choose the best course of action based on the situation.” I cleared my throat, readying myself to read aloud. For some reason or other it’s protocol to administer the test in that boring, monotone, overly enunciative voice you might hear in a work training video.. I suppose it’s so even the slowest hybrid can understand each word. “Imagine you’re in a public park and you notice a young child wandering away from their parents. The child appears to be lost and scared. What should you do?”

“A child is … one who looks like you, yes? … Human?”

I frowned a bit at the question. Preferring not to think too deeply about the implications of the clarification, I answered simply “Yes. The child in the scenario is a human. Now listen up, I’m only going to read these options once. Option A: Approach the child calmly and attempt to communicate with them, asking where their parents are. B: Call out to the parents, pointing the child in their direction. C: Ignore the situation, assuming somebody else will intervene. Which option do you choose, Coarse?”

“ … The response you are looking for is the first.” An interesting choice of words. And a deliberate one.

“That’s correct,” I said flatly, “Option A is the preferred response according to standard human etiquette. Let’s proceed. Imagine you’re in a crowded shopping mall, and you accidentally bump into an elderly woman carrying several bags. Apologies are exchanged but the woman appears upset and begins yelling at you. How should you handle the situation?”

“The elderly are … fragile, yes?”

“I don’t - … I suppose that’s not an inaccurate descriptor. Anyway, here are the options. Option D: Offer to help the woman carry her bags, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience. E: Politely excuse yourself, stating you didn’t mean to cause trouble. Option F: Stand your ground, arguing that the collision was unintentional. … Choose an option.”

“ The response you are looking for is again, the first.”

My jaw clenched at the hybrid’s answer. My patience wore thinner by the minute. Its echoic reply felt like mockery. I looked up from the papers, trying to stare daggers into the giant beast in the cell. It seemed unfazed. I looked back at the papers. “Yes. D is the best choice in this scenario. It demonstrates not only one’s empathy, but their willingness to make amends. Let's move on.” I braced myself for another smartass response to the next scenario. Then began to launch into the spiel. “Picture a quiet cafe in the evening, a couple sits in a corner booth-”

“The first one.”

“Goddammit Coarse!” I slammed the folder into the ground of the cell. “You’re not supposed to blindly guess the answers, or pick what you think I want, you’re supposed to listen to me and react based on the situation I present to you! Option G: -”

“It will always be the first one.”

“Just do the fucking test!”

“Doctor, is it common for hybrids to … exhibit pattern recognition?” It asked me, its voice loud enough to drown out my own.

“... n-no. That is unusual.” I said, trepidation setting in about where this conversation was going.

“In each scenario … the first option presented is the most favorable. The second is acceptable. The third is unacceptable.”

My mouth fell open, my initial outrage giving way to shock. My mind was reeling from the implications of just how intelligent this hybrid actually was. “How … did you figure that out?”

“Furthermore, good Doctor … these scenarios … imagine a world in which a hybrid may speak to a human. I wonder … if such a world … exists.”

A dry laugh escaped my mouth. “You learn so fast, Coarse. Where did you even learn half of those words? … You’re right, these scenarios were meant to prepare you for hypothetical interactions with humans. But the reality would be far more complicated.”

“I believe I have asked you enough questions today, Doctor. I know how … exhausted they can make you. “

“Thanks. I’ll see you tomorrow. Try to get some sleep, huh?”

“I will try … as I often do, Doctor.” It says, curling up on the floor.

I didn’t like that response.

As I left the Enclosure Room and rejoined Dr. Patel in the lab, she had a sullen look. I quickly saw why. Dr. Peck had made another surprise appearance, and was reviewing our tapes. “You let this little rat look at our recordings? This can’t be good.” I whispered to Dr. Patel, my talk with Coarse had left me unable to hide my frustrations and anxiety. It was certainly a bad time for the head-honcho to be testing my patience further. I walked over to him and checked the video. It was the time I smacked #0014 in the beak when it bit me too hard.

“You have astoundingly little patience.” Dr. Peck had the audacity to say to me.

“Do you not see the blood gushing from my hand? I needed stitches. That little bit of discipline worked fine, it only nips at me now. Anyway, what do you need?” I asked, my heart racing. We should really get rid of some of these tapes.

He paused the video and stood up. “I have come to tell you that I did re-read through Zero-Zero-One-Six’s file, at your … colorful request. Combined with the updated information Dr. Patel has sent me since, and I am inclined to agree with you. It has shown exponential growth and I should wish to meet with it. I will be back tomorrow, and I’d like you to be present.”

“M-me? Why?” I was taken off-guard by this. I was suspicious of such an offer, yes, but also honored. As much as I didn’t like him, he was still the boss of multiple facilities. It was, objectively speaking, an honor to be requested.

“As its primary caregiver, the credit to the development of such a creature –whether good or bad– should go to you. As such, I would like for you to join me when I do meet with the creature for the first time. Besides that, I predict your presence will put the beast at ease if it feels anxiety or any other emotion that would impede my observation.”

Ah, so that was why. I was needed to wrangle it because I was the only one who knew how to talk to hybrids like they were more than some mindless mutants. “Okay … sure. I mean, that’s great. But that update could have been a phone call. Why are you here?” I didn’t trust this man for even a second. He was scheming something.

“Oh that? I just wanted to see you.” He said through a smirk.

“God help me Noah, I’ll throw up on your shoes right now. If that’s all you're here for, leave the lab so I can finish my work and go home.”

“Yes, I’m aware of your terribly long commute home, I’m sure you’d like to get right on that,” he said dismissively.

“Bite me.”

“Perhaps I should outsource that to Zero-Zero-One-Four instead. Adieu.” Dr. Peck got one last jab in as he walked his pompous ass out the door.

“Doctor,” I looked to Patel for answers once Peck had left the room. “What was he looking for?”

“Classified. Sorry.” She said, meekly.

“Naturally.” The tightness in my chest was getting worse, but it reminded me of something. I remembered a promise I made. “Doctor,” I began again. “Why can some of the hybrids talk, but others can’t?” Like … Fourteen has Parrot DNA does it not? Parrots can speak.”

“ … That’s … classified.” She said, clearly disappointed with her inability to help me.

“Thanks.” I replied, my voice dripping with sarcasm. It had started to dawn on me that ‘need-to-know’ didn’t mean I needed to know much – if anything at all. One would think working with gene-spliced anomalies in a secret lab would facilitate a little more trust.

“Fine. Then … just … what is Coarse spliced with?”

She just looked at me. Confused.

“Don’t tell me that’s classified too, I’ll throw us both in Triple-Oh-Three’s enclosure.”

“Then I’d best not say anything.” Dr. Patel responded with what I think I mistook in the moment as a smirk.

“You’re fuckin’ useless. Can you tell me anything?”

“I can tell you that you look very tired.” Dr. Patel said, her usual happy demeanor changed to a frustrated tone. She was done with my shit, I’d officially worn down the normally very forbearing Dr. Patel.

“You mean ‘like shit?” I corrected. I assumed in that moment I looked the way I felt, both physically and emotionally.

“ … I was only joking before. Sixteen is an alligator-hybrid. I thought it was obvious.” her tone was flat. Icy.

I was immediately embarrassed, so embarrassed I just wanted to disappear. “I’m … I’m sorry, Dr. Patel, I didn’t mean to bite your head off. It’s been a long … couple of weeks, for me.” I sighed, wishing I could stop snapping at people as a first response to stress. I sat down and pushed my face into my hands. Then it all came out. I think it was an anxiety attack, but I don’t have those often so I can’t be sure. My chest was tight, my tears wouldn’t stop, my breaths were shallow and ragged – it felt like I wasn’t actually breathing at all. I was a mess. “I’m so sorry, Dr. Patel. I just … I don’t know anything, nobody’s telling me anything, I just -”

She got me a tissue. “Go home, Allison. I’ll finish your work.” Her tone did nothing to assure me of her forgiveness. Rather, I felt as though my blubbering was just interrupting her concentration.

“Yeah … Okay. Thank you Dr. Patel.”

I walked home, utterly embarrassed. Some cars drove by me on the street, I hoped they couldn’t see my red face illuminated by their high beams.

I woke up the next morning, my alarm had been going off for a while. I was already late to work. I called Dr. Patel to let her know I wouldn’t be coming in today.

“That sounds like a good Idea, Dr. Shah. I’ll alert Dr. Peck that you do not feel well, and that he should come by tomorrow instead.” She told me. I think her tone was more pleasant than when we had last spoken, but I wasn’t sure.

I assured her “Thank you. I’ll be in tomorrow, promise.” before hanging up.

No matter how boring and monotonous my job could be, an impromptu day off was worse. Trudging around my house, looking for things to do. Maybe I’ll catch up on laundry or something on any given day off, but in general, not having things already planned to do is a real drag when you live in the middle of nowhere. I started reflecting on my conversations with Coarse. I knew I shouldn’t have been doing it, because every time I did I got another knot in my chest, but I couldn’t help it. The more I tried to avoid thinking about them, the more ingrained Coarse’s questions and choices of words would get stuck in my head. I knew it was smarter than the limited vocabulary it had. I knew it was communicating secret messages to me, albeit without having a choice in the level of secrecy. Most of all … I started reflecting on how I may have unintentionally flipped the script on the others. If they wanted to keep secrets from me, I’d do the same. I never got to finish Coarse’s data from the H.B.T the night before, they have its raw data, sure, but none of my comments. As far as they know, they’re dealing with a hybrid who could simply ace a multiple choice test. They had no idea the intelligence it really had. That’s classified.

A few hours before I would have gone home on a normal day, I got a call from Dr. Patel. “We’ve made a huge mistake. All of this.” Her voice came through her ragged breaths. I think she was crying, and afraid.

“What? What do you mean? What mistake? Did something happen with Coarse?” I asked to a dead line. She’d hung up. Well, that was certainly going to get me out of bed. I all but sprinted over to the lab immediately. When I entered there was no sign of Dr. Patel. I asked the aides where she went, expecting to hear the ‘c’ word again, but they basically just shrugged their shoulders. The one aide I talked to said she never came back from the Enclosure Room. “Get me the sec footage from today, right now.” I told him before tearing through the hallways, heading straight to cell number 0016.

Some things I’ve learnt (if helpful) for others:

1. Use a powerful hand frother. I started off with a cheap weak one and it was very hard to get any foam. Switched to Agaro Milk Frother and that has helped a lot!

2. I am yet to achieve the “wet paint” type of milk. What you are seeing in the photos is more thicker foam which I placed at the top with the use of a milk pitcher (spout really helps!) and then made the designs using a latte art pen. The initial milk that I pour is still too “thin”, but it does help set the “canvas” for the art. 

3. Use higher fat % milk. It’s harder to get proper foam with low fat/ skim milk. 

4. I know Indian households are used to buying milk packets, boiling and cooling the milk, and then using it. However, once the milk is boiled beyond 60-65 degrees Celsius, it cannot be frothed the right way to get the right texture. Hence, use tetrapack milk (eg. Amul Gold - 4.5% fat) which can be heated directly for frothing. 

5. I generally put the milk pitcher in a pot of hot water and slowly heat the milk in it. This helps with heating the milk more gradually, without hot spots (I use my finger to keep stirring). Apparently the right temp (if you don’t have a thermometer) is when the milk is too hot to dip my finger into for more than 1 second but no further (eg. not to the point of boiling)

The name Emily isn't her real name, just in case anyone I know stumbles on this.

So me (31F) and ""Emily"" (also 31F) have been friends since we were 11. Like proper best friends all through school and uni. Sleepovers constantly, we went on some holidays together, we told each other everything. We even did that cringey thing in school where we'd swear we'd be BFFs for life and pinky promised we'd be each other's maids of honor no matter what. It was legit that tight back then.

After we graduated we ended up in different cities, about a 2-hour drive apart (two hours might not sound that far for some of you, but here a two-hour drive basically crosses the entire country). For a while we actually tried really hard to keep the friendship going strong. We'd take turns visiting, have some marathon Discord/phone calls, plan whole weekends. But yeah... life happened. I got really into my job and I'm now looking for an apartment to buy with my boyfriend, so my free time is basically zero. Emily on the other hand decided to slow down after uni, deliberately picked a more chill job and still gets a lot of support from her parents so she has way more time for hobbies and relaxing. Our priorities and schedules just don't match at all anymore.

These days it's basically instagram likes, the odd meme in DMs, and a group chat with a couple other girls from school that barely anyone replies to anymore. We probably see each other once or twice a year max, when it's ""convenient"". And when we do hang out it's nice enough but honestly pretty surface-level. No real deep talks anymore. At least that's how I feel it.

Anyway this Christmas she messages me saying she's gonna be in my city the week between Christmas and New Years and asks if we can ""finally do a proper catch-up, just us, like the old days"". The last couple times she suggested meeting up I kinda made excuses (too busy with work, family stuff, whatever) but this time I was feeling a bit guilty for avoiding her before, and it's Christmas, so I said sure and we grabbed coffee yesterday.

Everything was fine at first, just normal chit-chat, but then halfway through she starts getting all nostalgic. ""I miss when we used to talk every single day"" and ""it feels like we've drifted and I don't even know what I did wrong"". I tried to brush it off gently like oh you know, adult life, we're both busy, our lives have changed so much, blah blah. But then she straight-up asked if I was pulling away on purpose.

I kinda froze and then just... told the truth? I said look, I still care about you a ton and all the memories from back then are so special to me, but I don't feel that same super-close day-to-day connection anymore and... I'm actually okay with that. I made sure to tell her she didn't do anything wrong if that's what she thinks, it's literally just how life went for both of us. I'd rather we just be those friends who catch up properly when we happen to be in the same place instead of pretending we're each other's ride-or-die when we're clearly not. It's a level of closeness that I just can't give anymore and I didn't want to keep forcing it or feeling guilty every time we talked.

She went really quiet, looked like she was gonna cry, and said something about me basically giving up on the friendship. I tried to say that's not how I see it but she just shut down. We finished our coffees in awkward silence and she left pretty quick. Then last night she posted a vague story on Instagram about ""some people really change once they get a little success"" and I'm pretty sure she's referring to me

Now I'm second-guessing everything. I feel like shit because I hate that I hurt her, but at the same time I was tired of doing the slow fade and faking enthusiasm every time she suggested ""getting back to how things used to be"".

If you said “2025 is my year,” I hope you’re okay. I really do. Because everyone I know who said that (myself included) got humbled in ways we didn’t even know were possible. By August, we were all walking around like emotionally bankrupt zombies, clutching  coffee and trauma like it was a personality trait.

I started the year with a plan. Not even a delusional one. Just a humble, well-organized Notion board and a few whispered affirmations. I wasn’t trying to become a millionaire or find the love of my life. I just wanted to sleep better, drink more water, and maybe stop spiraling every time my landlord texted “Hi.”

But the year had hands.  
Quarter 1: Emotional chaos.  
Quarter 2: Financial chaos.  
Quarter 3: Existential dread and a mysterious rash.  
Q4? I’m just a girl with a cracked phone screen, a dwindling data bundle, and a deep, unshakable fatigue that no amount of sleep can fix.

And the worst part? It wasn’t just me. Everyone I know was tired. Not just sleepy-tired. Existentially tired. “I haven’t felt joy since March” type of tired or “I’m not even sad, I’m just... buffering” kind of tired. We were all walking around like NPCs in a game that forgot to load the next quest.

So no. I’m not claiming 2026. I’m not manifesting. I’m not journaling. I’m not doing a vision board. I’m entering the year like a suspicious raccoon.... quiet, cautious, and ready to bite if necessary 😂.

Looking for real advice.","I’m not here for validation, motivation, or “you’re young bro” comments. I don’t have a mentor, I’m not chasing LinkedIn narratives — just trying to reduce long-term mistakes by learning from people who’ve already been through similar paths.

My path so far (all before 20):

• Media intern - photo, video, editing

• B2B presentation design company — worked with international clients, real corporate exposure

• Barista at a coffee startup — ops + customer handling (side quest)

• Currently in a BPO — in-hand \~30k

•  Switching next to a media manager role for a salon franchise

I’ve picked up a lot of skills — from graphic design to coffee making — but I still feel stuck. Not confused, not lazy — stuck. Like I’m moving sideways instead of forward.

One important context: I didn’t stick long in earlier roles intentionally. I was leveraging my age to switch fast, sample environments, and build range. That worked early on. Now it feels like the same strategy is starting to work against me — I don’t have a clear long-term axis to compound on, and execution without a direction is getting harder.

I do want to build something of my own later. Right now I’m staying inside structured roles to understand how organizations actually work — incentives, hierarchy, money flow, decision-making. One thing that’s become obvious: most people ultimately optimize for a fat package, and I’m trying to understand that game before playing it on my own terms.

I also know the classic advice: pick one skill and get lethal at it. The problem is — broad experience has made that choice harder. Everything looks viable, nothing feels decisive, and choosing based on interest alone feels like another way to keep oscillating.

I need clarity and long-term direction. I have goals, but I’m not yet in a position to execute them properly.

For those who followed unconventional paths — how did you build clarity before you were ready to act? What helped you move from exploration to commitment without locking yourself in too early? How did you decide what to focus on so your efforts actually compounded over time?",1,1767021916.0,IndiaCareers,1,1.0,False

Haven't had sex since Thanksgiving.,"Y’all, I’ve been lurkin’ on this sub for a couple months now, readin’ y’all’s stories with my mornin’ coffee, feelin’ like I was peekin’ into everybody’s bedroom windows (which, let’s be honest, is exactly what it feels like). I finally worked up the nerve to post because… well, I think I belong here now, and that makes me sadder than I expected.

I’m Amanda, 46, married to Jay goin’ on 21 years, four kids (17, 15, 12, and 10—Lord help me). For the longest time our sex life was honestly pretty great. Two, sometimes three times a week, lights mostly off because old habits die hard, but I was happy. Real happy. I almost always finish (sometimes too quick, which Jay teases me about in the sweetest way), and I’d fall asleep feelin’ loved and wanted and all those good things you’re supposed to feel after twenty-plus years.

But these last few months it’s just… tapered off. Started with “we’re both tired,” turned into “maybe this weekend,” and now here we are: we haven’t had actual sex since Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, y’all. That’s over a month ago. I keep countin’ the days like it’s gonna magically change.

We’ve messed around some—couch make-out sessions after the kids crash, a little foolin’ around in the shower once—but it always stops right before the real thing. He’ll kiss my forehead, tell me he loves me, roll over, and I’m left starin’ at the ceilin’ fan wonderin’ what switched off in him.

I tried to be cute about it for Christmas. Made him a little booklet of “sex coupons” like some Pinterest mom gone wild. One of them says “Good for one sex act. No limits.” (I blame the wine for that wording.) He thought it was adorable, gave me a big hug… and the booklet is still sittin’ on his nightstand, untouched.

I’m not mad at him. I know life’s stressful—work, kids, bills, the usual. But I miss feelin’ desired. I’m still the same size I was when we got married (miracle of never exercisin’, I guess), and I like to think I don’t look half bad for a mom of four. Yet lately I catch him lookin’ at me like I’m just… the person who does the laundry.

Anyway, just needed to say it out loud to folks who get it.

1pyp0ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1pyp0ee/ive_downloaded_10_note_apps_then_never_opened/,I've downloaded 10 note apps. Then never opened them again. Here's one solution I built for myself.,"I know this feeling too well.

I download a new note app. This is it. *This* is the one that'll finally get me organized.

I spend an evening setting it up. Notion with its databases and templates. Obsidian with plugins and folder structures. Or maybe just Apple Notes because ""simple is better.""

It works. For a week. Maybe two.

Then life happens. I stop opening it. My notes become a graveyard of good intentions.

**Here's what I realized: I don't have a discipline problem. I have a tool problem.**

**The Notion trap:** Every time I come back to it (usually months later), I have to relearn how it works. How did I structure this again? What's a relation vs a rollup? Why did I set it up this way? It's a constant battle of understanding my own system. I end up spending more time figuring out Notion than actually taking notes.

**Obsidian:** Loved the idea. Spent hours on plugins, folder structures, and learning markdown. Then life got busy and it became another icon I scrolled past.

**Apple Notes:** Too simplistic. Lacking taste. The interface feels like an afterthought. I couldn't even stay with it for a day—it just didn't feel right to use.

**Pen and paper though?** That actually worked. Seriously. I could jot things down fast. No learning curve. No setup. It helped me tremendously.

Until I lost the notebook. Again.

Or left it at home when I needed it at work. Or couldn't search for that one thing I wrote down three weeks ago. Or spilled coffee on it.

Physical notes are amazing... until they're just *gone*.

None of these tools solve my actual problem: **Getting thoughts out of my head into somewhere I'll actually look again AND won't disappear.**

The issue isn't capture. Every app does that. The issue is *coming back*.

**Why don't I come back?**

* Opening the app feels like homework
* Finding what I need takes too long
* The interface doesn't pull my attention
* It requires maintaining a system I don't have time for

**What if notes were just... visible?**

My brain processes images 60,000x faster than text. I can scan a wall of physical sticky notes in seconds. But open Apple Notes? I'm scrolling and searching.

That's the gap I wanted to fix. The pen-and-paper feeling, but digital. That actually sticks around.

**Visual boards. Sticky notes. Nothing else.**

No folders within folders. No tag taxonomy. No markdown. Just boards I can see at a glance.

Meeting notes? One board. I can see all my action items without clicking into 12 different notes.

Weekly planning? One board. My tasks, events, and priorities all visible together.

Brain dump? One board. Random thoughts don't disappear into an endless scroll.

**It's specifically for my messy middle:**

* The meeting notes with action items
* The weekly goals and planning
* The random ideas that pop up
* The things I need to remember but don't know where to put

I'm not trying to replace Notion for documentation. Not replacing Obsidian for my knowledge base. Not replacing my task manager.

Just the frustrating part—the stuff that falls through the cracks because it doesn't fit anywhere else.

**Why this approach works for me:**

Speed: Capture is as fast as pen and paper. Finding things is instant because I can see everything.

No setup: No databases to configure. No plugins to install. I just start writing.

Visual scanning: My eye catches colored notes on a board. It doesn't catch line 47 in a text file.

Won't disappear: Unlike my notebooks, it syncs across my devices and doesn't get lost.

Actually useful: It helps instead of making me feel guilty about my organizational system.

**So I built it.** I built this app genuinely because I want to solve these problems, I know it must be not only me who have same problems.

**Try it if you:**

* Keep going back to pen and paper despite wanting digital
* Have 5+ abandoned note apps on your phone
* Like simple but hate chaos
* Want organization without the overhead
* Need somewhere to dump your brain that you'll actually check

I've been using it daily for now. Not because I'm disciplined, but because it actually helps instead of adding to my guilt pile.

I (20M) met this girl (20F) in college, she was my classmate and we started talking to each other after an event.

We talked for around 5-6 months where we both started flirting, later she told me that she is in a relationship with another guy but it has been on and off for a long time so i didnt care much.

The guy is also known as our college's asshole cause he is a extremely manipulative and is a bitter guy. He constantly neglected her during their own relationship which caused her to get fed up with it. He used to talk to other girls over text late at night and wouldnt pay much attention to her.

She went to a college trip which i did not attend where she saw the guy being close with other girls and she got really obsessed over his actions.

I liked her because i though she was very genuine and later she told that she also felt the same way but cannot commit to a relationship because she hasnt fully moved on from her ex.

I was very considerate and though if i love her as much as i can, it would help her move on.

The fact is that she did not even try to move on and was in constant contact with her ex (which she broke up after we both confessed). She was extremely obsessed about him and used to talk about him to me every day.

At the same time she told me she liked me a lot and im the best person she has ever met and it was going so smooth for around 4 months.

During those 4 months i did everything i can, constantly got flowers, spent a lot of time with her. Took her out and did almost everything i can.

I am also a software dev who earns money through hackathons and very few of the guys in my college who earns at my age and i am doing considerably good comparing to all other people.

It all started going to shit when her ex's mum called her home for christmas and talked about the relationship and asked her to get back with him.

She obviously couldnt tell her son is being an asshole and told her she couldnt commit due to religion again.

Then she proceeded to dump me because ""she was hurting me a lot"" and ""i deserve better""

I have never met a more mentally unstable and broken person but even when dumping me she told me she loves me a lot and i will hold a huge part in her heart.

She is an avoidant who always dismisses hard conversations and she always dosent even want to hold accountability for the things she does.

There are many instances ive left out, but ill just summarise them,  
\-She has a college crush( like a celeb crush) and went out with him at night for coffee in the name of ""Practice for an event""  
\-She has chosen to go with her ex to the doctor cause ""mum told her so and she cant damage his name to her mum""  
\-She has told me outright ""She can never love me as much she has loved her ex""  
\-A guy accidently kissed her in the pub, which ive told her not to go without me.

\-We have been physically intimate and took all my first times and told me how much she loved it

\-Carried them through out an entire hackathon due to her lack of technical expertise and won 2000 dollars and i got blamed at the end for ""not involving her a lot in the project""

These are one of the many traumatic things ive had to endure for 4 months all in the hope that she would get better and work on things.

But after those 4 months she spent 2 months trying to ""make me hate her"" by being an asshole.

Atlast she has decided she dosent want to talk to me for now and when asked about it, she told me she might patch up with her ex if ""all things play right""

Ive cried for so many days and im having too many panic attacks and nervous breakdowns.

How can someone be so cruel and discard me like this after ive done so much for them.

I understand she would want to go back to her ex if he was a great guy.  
But all she has done is tell me how much she hates his ass cause he never treated her right eventhough she has cried and begged so much to him.

What should i do in this situation, how can i move on?",1,1767021706.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1pyovrv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyovrv,Symphonium Crimson: Dedicated to Treble Heads,"Symphonium is one of the leading audio brands in the audio space. They are part of the brilliant folks who helped bring the Subtonic STORM to the world.  They have also worked on benchmarks in the kilobuck IEM space, with models such as Helios and later Titan.  Surprisingly and unlike most brands in the IEM space these days, they have managed to keep most of their design and production in-house. Because IEMs are such a fast-moving market, some IEMs don’t end up standing the test of time and having much staying power even a few months after their release. Crimson was released in 2023, which raises the question: how does it hold up in 2025?

**Build and Comfort:**

To kick things off with the build, Crimson features an aluminum shell with a nice and bright red anodization. The shell seems well put together with no notable issues. However, I would appreciate a titanium shell at its 1500 price point. It is somewhat understandable due to Symphonium basing their production in Singapore, but I digress. Overall, the aluminum does not hold back the quality of IEM.

The presentation of the IEM itself is quite nice. You can really feel the “Crimson” theme Symphonium was going for. Although, I wish they would’ve made the cable red as well, but the copper compliments the presentation quite well. The branding is also quite nice, and it does not make crimson “flashy” but still compelling to me.

The case is much the same. It’s a metal style puck case that shows a modest amount of luxury while not being overly flashy. Holding the case in my hands, I can get a sense of weight while the inside is plush for the IEM.

As for the cable, It’s quite nice and premium feeling. It comes with a swappable termination which is something that has only made its way to budget IEMs recently. There is no real memory of the cable, which makes it ideal for quick and easy roadie wraps nor is it very microphonic either. Left and right are clearly marked, which is great if you’re like me and had some frustration from this in the past from other manufacturers. All of this makes the cable a very solid stock option in my books.

Comfort wise, Crimson almost gets five stars from me in this department. The feeling of the shell in your ear is snug and not overbearing. It’s small, which makes it not bothersome for long listening sessions. However, Crimson is not a vented IEM which leads to issues with pressure build up for me during long term listening. This may be a deal breaker for someone who is pressure sensitive.

To wrap things up here. Crimson’s build quality matches its price range, but some listeners might have issues with the non-vented design it has.

**Sound and Comparison:**

Symphonium has developed a bit of a reputation for creating bass focused sets and this expertise is most definitely not missing from Crimson. Crimson’s bass comes across as more rumble than slam which means you can really feel the weight in sub bass heavy tracks.  However, this can sometimes overshadow its mid-range presentation in some mixes. This can make bass guitars have too much bloom at times even if the overall texture is competent. Kick drums can have a similar issue where the excess sub bass causes a slower decay than what I’d prefer.  It really follows the trend of what the modern sets do with the more emphasized sub bass.

This is not entirely a bad thing. When you relate the bass response to the mids and treble, the boosted sub bass can really help balance things tonally.

For me, the mids on crimson have aged almost like a fine wine. There is a slight thinness due to the lack of mid bass body, but the presentation is nice. Vocals are clear but they take a bit of a backseat compared to other instruments in the mix. They are breathy with the extra air present in the IEM. Instruments like pianos and acoustic guitars are presented well, but there is a sharp transient in them that creates a somewhat metallic timbre.

The treble is where this IEM gets tricky… I have come to have a bit of a love-hate relationship with it. At first, I tried this IEM on my Qudelix-5K and I almost wrote it off from the start as the treble fatigue set in almost instantly. There was a notable amount of sibilance and even tip rolling across multiple sets such as Final Type E, Coffee tips, and Velvets did not help.

I ended up trying this IEM on a Fiio K17 and it really came to life in that moment. I am not much of a source person, but I believe that the Qudelix-5K did not deliver the current that Crimson really needed to make it sound its best. Readers thinking about buying crimson should double check to ensure that it can ran crimson properly.

With that in mind, Crimson is still a very bright IEM. I found a lot of sharpness in the transients that gives an undertone of sibilance to many instruments especially cymbals and tambourines. This can easily cause fatigue in listeners and treble is notably hard to EQ.

On the flip side, Crimson’s treble gives it great subjective (technical) performance. The imaging and separation are fantastic on this set, and it handles busy tracks well. I wish the timbre performance were better, but it is a benchmark in its price bracket for imaging, soundstage, and separation for me.

I could not think of a better set to compare to this IEM than my personal daily driver: Letshouer Cadenza 12 OG (C12). There are tradeoffs between them for me.  C12 has a vent and a titanium shell; however, the shell is scratch prone and is a little big for my ears. Crimson wins on shell size, but the vent on Cadenza 12 means that I can listen for longer with C12.

As for sound, I slightly prefer C12’s presentation. It has some extra warmth that balances the bright treble plus its focus on mid bass which I prefer to the sub bass. However, Crimson handles some subjective aspects such as imaging better for me versus C12.  If you’re someone who prefers more sub bass and less warmth you may prefer the presentation Crimson presents overall.

**Conclusion:**

I think it is safe to say, Symphonium Crimson does hold up in 2025 despite its age. It’s a great entry into the kilobuck sphere, with a familiar tuning that can be found in some of the newer midrange sets but with a premium build and accessories package.

The tuning is for those who really enjoy a treble emphasis balanced with hearty amounts of sub bass. The mids follow the regular “new meta“ tuning with a slight vocal recession. The treble, however, can have a slight metallic timbre and overall, it is personally too bright for my tastes.

I would recommend Crimson to those seeking great technical performance and bright treble paired with a good sub bass emphasis. For those seeking a neutral set Crimson does not really hit this mark. However, it will be great for those seeking something energetic and bright.

I’m a 31-year-old guy who’s been on and off them for about 10 years. I was in an 8-month relationship that ended around five months ago — she broke up with me. Since then, I’ve tried getting back on the apps, but honestly, it hasn’t gone well.  

The breakup really took a toll on me. I’m starting to turn the corner, but I know I still have some work to do to move on and be a better version of myself. On top of that, work has been stressful and a little disappointing lately.  

When I scroll through the apps, it feels like I see the same people over and over — and if I do find someone I’m into, we never match. I’ve read and watched plenty about the pros and cons of dating apps, but here’s what bothers me most:  

1. There are so many options that people give up on someone way too easily.  

2. They can make me feel sad or discouraged.  

3. Honestly, they sometimes make me feel even lonelier.  

I’m getting older, and I really do want to settle down, get married, and start a family one day. But the harder I try, the less it seems to work out on dates. I’ve never really gone more than a week without using dating apps when I’m single — I’m constantly searching for someone. Yet here I am, still looking.  

So I’ve decided I need to do something different. As a society, we’ve gotten so used to connecting through our phones that real in-person interaction feels harder — and I’ll admit, it even makes me a bit nervous. But maybe that’s exactly what I need.  

My goal for the start of 2026 is to take a break from dating apps and focus on meeting people in person. I’m going to join a co-ed bowling league, hang out at local coffee shops, and just get out more in general. I want to do things for myself and be more social overall.  

If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening to my rant. For those who’ve taken this approach — how did it work for you? Where did you meet people if you weren’t using apps? And what types of hobbies or co-ed activities helped you meet new friends or potential partners? I’m not going into this expecting to meet “the one,” but I do want to build connections and maybe find something real again.

Also, I am very respectful and not a forward person. I haven’t approached women in public in the past but feel like I need to do that or if I am in a group ask them out. Rejection is hard especially doing in person verse the apps. Any advice on approach someone in person or asking someone out with out being to forward? ",3,1767021446.0,dating,10,0.8,False

So here we go i will just start and try to griup things together

So im 16m no school and i go to a place to get a rythm and eventually go back to school or work im there on monday and friday from 9-12 and wednsday 9-15 i and i have meds citalopram iirc been on them for idk more then a year i gues

Now i dont have any irl friends only a group online which i game with for the past 4 ish years and i like it but idk i still feel lonely then at the place there came this guy and we became friends went to his place once etc but we dont see each other much irl besides the location since he lives a town over but we still do have fecent ammount of contact online

Now there was also this trans guy 17 which came in after summer vacation and we had a nice click and he asked if i maybe wanted to do something irl i said sure and we did we were at my place from 1pm till 11pm mentioned to me he mentionef if you want we could do something tommorow got fries watched a movie talked scrolled weird fetish sub reddits we could talk about EVERYTHING if u catch my drift Next day i asked him around 2pm i fell asleep had a missed deleted messagr when i wokr up at 6pm i sended ? He said he was out with his sister

Now that was on a friday i think 10th of november? But next monday i went bald idk why i was bored and tought it will grow back anyway so i sended a pic of my bald head and a joke to see how far i could go bad tendency i have im really ashamed but it may have been me bald with a random text wanna be fwb and only after i texted it i started realising how many wrong ways this could have been picked up i texted sorry shouldnt yave done that bad tendency he asked what is fwb i explained he said hahaha and to see if i was still in the safe zone i stupidly asked but if youre up for it he said what i said fuck..... and he mentioned he didnt feel comfortable and i know this is completeley on ME But afylter that i was stupidlt sending a lot of text asking if it was ok etc he said it was but i couldnt leave it so i asked multiple times which was stupid a aplogised for that and i still couldbt leave it but managed to stop texting this was 1-2 weeks after the incident iirc then i sended a message saying really sorry what happend hope u dont think differently of me and if u want to do something again sometime just let me know if not its totally fine He didnt read it so me and my stupid ass resend it multiple times and delete the old ones

Now people reading trust me i meant this as a joke im not stupid enough to ruin a possible friendship over wanna being fwb which i didnt want to but ad seen before im not that stupid but quite stupid

Anyway he was only on the location there on wendsday 12-15 and he didnt always shoe up since he found it difficult first week didnt show 2nd week didnt show vut the councelor did come to me and said he told me you made a jokr that didnt land good burlt he wasnt feeling great and might have been fine with otherwise And he said if i could tell you (me) that he really likrd thr contact here at the place but that outsidr of herr is too much rn

Later that day home i semt the councelor if he could say back i totally understand and if he wanted to do anything ever again he could jus text and if not also fine he said the first part to him but said that i should text the 2nd part myself So i texted it he didnt read it after a week and i jist deleted thr chat history and let it be now i havent seen him since 10th of november nor will since he turned 18 this december and once ur 18 u need to go so that was it but i sometimes still think was it my fault or was that geniunly too much for him like mentally etc

And i just think about it sometimes and think fuck wad it my fault or no But on the other hand im only 16 people come and go And ik the part above all mistakes were MY mistakes no need to mention that

Now that turned out longer then i expected so sorry for that but i dont think thats a major cause for how im feeling but i just wanted it to be added maybe just a star in the unicersenof how im feeling

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And 2 more things I feel like im not allowed to feel better like when i feel a tad bit better and then gets worse again i feel like im not allowed to feel beter And talked with the councelor about this she said sje knows what i mean she has had a depression and burnout a few years back and she siad maybe thats because this is ur new normal now or feels like my new normal

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

and at the location i go to there is a girl 16 i mean were fine with each other play some pool usually etc but she goes out gets drunk etc and im like damn id like to expiernce it but i cant so to speak for lack of a better word

1pyoqet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1pyoqet/i_hate_that_tipping_culture_is_being_normalised/,I hate that tipping culture is being normalised and I'll keep fighting against it,"I'm not one to go too often to restaurants, but for the times I go, I see more and more common that waiters are asking for tips at the end of the service. I usually feel very uncomfortable pressing ""NO TIP"" when they're holding the POS and looking at what I type. 

I also noticed that if you leave no tip, on the payment machine, waiters will take an ""offended"" or ""dismissive"" behaviour, rushing away or not saying good bye when I leave. 

Not to mention tips for making a coffee - 1 euro tip for a 4.20 cup of coffee? It takes literally 120 seconds to make that and I'm supposed to also give a tip? 

  
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a tip when it's deserved and the waiter went out of their way to be accommodating and welcoming.

hello, i am new to this subreddit. i've been cooking up a story idea for about a year now, and have finally decided to make it a reality. I'm making more specifically a comic but I want some help with the story. currently I have the main outline but I want some critiques on it :) i've never put my work out anywhere online before so i'm a bit nervous but, you know, i guess i need to get used to this aha! Note that this is more notes on how to tackle the story for me, but again, I just want to know if its actually a good story.

Here's a background of the world this is set in: in 2027, World War breaks out for a third time and its effects are devastating. It lasts for around 5 years before ending with an event that kills three quarters of the world population (the event was like a nuclear strike on steroids). The story takes place in 2035, 3 years after the war has ended. The war caused Earth's climate to become practically unliveable, and so a program was launched by a company that specialises in space travel. Three trained professionals, a pilot, a scientist, and a mechanic, are selected to be sent into space to explore and determine whether certain planets are either habitable or can help with restoring Earth's climate using resources. A year into the program, however, things are paused when the mechanic of the mission goes missing and cannot be found. A replacement is put on board, our main character, and our story begins there.

Act One: The story opens with a past recorded video of Oliver (the scientist), Ivan (the missing mechanic), and Ana (the pilot) celebrating Ivan’s birthday aboard the spaceship. The footage is warm and playful, but ends on an unsettling note when Ivan’s smile falters as he looks past the camera, held by Ana, before the recording abruptly cuts. This moment plants early unease and foreshadows later revelations. The scene transitions to Emily in the present, visually mirroring Ivan’s physical position as she eats a meal at a table in a home setting. Emily’s daily life is marked by emotional distance and quiet suffocation. At home, she is physically present but disengaged, surrounded by her mother and younger brother yet unable to connect meaningfully with them. News reports about worsening climate conditions play in the background, largely ignored. Her mother’s interactions with her are transactional, focused on responsibility rather than conversation, reinforcing Emily’s sense of being trapped. After an argument breaks out with Emily's brother and her mother, her mother asks Emily to walk her brother to school. Emily takes her brother to school and then commutes to work, passing a protest outside a store selling oxygen masks, a necessity in today's society due to the worsening climate. During the confrontation, she overhears people discussing Ivan, credited as one of the minds behind the technology, whom Emily believes is still part of the space mission. The protestors openly criticize the company responsible for the program doing space travel as Ivan is directly associated with them, saying that it's 'taking too long' and such. Emily walks away, only for it to be revealed that she herself works for that same company. At work, Emily is shown to be highly capable and quietly indispensable. She manufactures requested machinery, fixes equipment for coworkers, and operates under poor conditions without complaint. When a serious accident nearly kills a colleague due to faulty wiring, Emily intervenes and saves them using her expertise. Despite being praised, she reacts with visible distress, brushing off attention rather than accepting it. Immediately after, Emily is summoned by her boss and informed of a “hiccup” in the space program: a crewmate is missing, and the company is desperate for a replacement. Emily is asked to be said replacement while they try to find Ivan. The request is framed less as an honor and more as a necessity. It is also revealed here that Emily applied for this job a year ago but got rejected in favour of Ivan after being deemed 'mentally unstable' after a work incident, however is being picked now since she is the only one qualified enough for the position. After brief hesitation, she agrees. That evening, Emily informs her family. Her mother and brother react poorly, leading to an argument. Her mother doesn't want her to leave since Emily is the main source of income for the family, but also the main caretaker. Emily, who does really want the job for her own selfish desires, pursues the job regardless. While she does feel a sense of responsibility for her family, she wants to also take this job, seeing it as an 'escape' out of both her family life and Earth's horrible climate. After a short time skip, Emily travels to the United States for the program’s launch, though her relationship with her mother remains unresolved. She is given a tour of the facility and the spaceship itself. She meets Oliver, who immediately attempts to put her at ease. They get along, though his enthusiasm contrasts with her restraint. Notably, she does not yet meet Ana. That evening, she attends a public relations event announcing the program’s continuation following Ivan’s disappearance. Emily is uneasy but supported by Oliver’s presence. Ana and the program’s director are present but not formally introduced. Emily delivers a speech that is awkward yet sincere, managing to hold her ground despite visible protests. Afterward, she retreats to a hallway to calm herself and briefly encounters a woman who makes an offhand comment about her new position, asking her if its what she really wants. The interaction is brief, but it's directness leaves Emily confused. On launch day, Emily is formally introduced to the crew—Oliver, the director, and Ana, who is revealed to be the same woman from the hallway. Emily is immediately uncomfortable but unable to withdraw. Before boarding, she checks her phone and receives a short but reassuring message from her mother, showing that while things are still unresolved between them there is still care. Act One ends with Emily boarding the spaceship: uncertain, displaced, but determined.

Act Two takes place several weeks after launch. The act opens aboard the spaceship with Emily repairing a malfunction in the cockpit. Ana observes closely, marking items off a checklist as Emily explains the problem and her solution. Oliver enters mid-task, having a cheery demeanour, before mentioning that they are approaching their first target planet. Before landing, Ana briefs the crew on the planet and stresses strict adherence to protocol. Emily has no issue following orders but is still weary around Ana, while Oliver appears uneasy with Ana’s tone. Upon arrival, they discover the planet is a barren wasteland, contradicting the data Ana was given. Evidence of a massive asteroid impact suggests a long-past mass extinction. Oliver questions the value of staying, noting there is nothing viable for him to sample. Ana hesitates, torn between mission expectations and the evidence in front of her. Without permission, Emily ventures ahead and discovers a network of underground caves. Although this leads the team to continue the mission, Ana grows noticeably colder toward Emily for defying her authority. As they explore, Emily proves her skill, modifying equipment on the fly. However she slips up at moments as well, too eager to explore areas that Ana has to prevent her from going to since they are dangerous. Despite this, Oliver becomes increasingly impressed and engages more openly with Emily, while Ana’s frustration mounts. After 3 days of searching with no tangible results, Ana orders a withdrawal. Emily argues to continue, believing she is close to something meaningful, but ultimately concedes that Ana’s reasoning is sound, they haven't found a thing. They return to the ship and set course for a second planet in the same system. The first planet's trip is rather short in comparison to the rest of the story's events. Later, Oliver reassures Emily that her work mattered and admits that, under different circumstances, they might have found something significant. During this conversation, he reveals that Ana is the director’s daughter. That night, while on watch duty, Emily reviews mission logs from the first planet, unsettled by a lingering feeling that something was missed. While reorganizing nearby equipment, she discovers old photographs and recordings of Ivan, Oliver, and Ana. After hesitating, she watches one of the tapes, a seemingly harmless moment between the three. Ana enters mid-viewing and reacts with disproportionate anger. Emily apologizes, which calms Ana down but it's obvious that the mention of Ivan struck a nerve for her. Emily awkwardly goes back to her station. The next day, the crew then arrives at the second planet, which contrasts sharply with the first—lush, vibrant, and teeming with plant life. The planet is marked uninhabitable due to a weak atmosphere. Despite its abundance of plants, they determine the flora would not survive Earth’s conditions due to how it can only survive in extremities. Ana is more irritable than before, distancing herself from both Emily and Oliver. Oliver, increasingly anxious, stays close to Emily, and the two talk as they explore. Oliver shares fragments of his past during the war, though he avoids emotional depth. His past hints at his tendency of avoidance, as his silence caused the deaths of many around him during the war, including his family (he was basically blackmailed into keeping quiet about government secrets but when he tried to tell people about it his family was killed so he's learnt that silence is survival). They soon discover an abandoned human research base. Ana recognizes it but offers no explanation. Oliver tells Emily that the planet had been studied during the war before being abandoned, and that they're back here to see if there were any unused research or samples that can be used, but he doesn't elaborate further. Inside the base, they uncover data suggesting that a rare plant species on one of the planet’s moons could—at least in theory—aid in restoring Earth’s ecosystems. For the first time, the team shares a sense of genuine hope and agrees to investigate. On the moon, they find only a small patch of the plant growing in an extremely hazardous area. Emily proposes a plan that would safely retrieve the sample but at the cost of valuable resources. Ana rejects it in favor of a faster, riskier approach. The argument escalates, and Emily confronts Ana personally, bringing up Ivan and questioning her judgment. Oliver remains silent, shocked by Emily’s defiance. Ana, now angered at Emily's personal attack, proceeds with her plan regardless. However, midway through, it begins to fail, causing Emily to break away and execute her own plan despite Oliver and Ana shouting for her to stop. Fully aware she may die, Emily presses on, framing the risk as both a chance to atone for her past (elaborated later) and to help save Earth. She nearly falls to her death, but at the last moment, Ana intervenes, pulling her to safety. Ana is visibly shaken, her controlled exterior briefly cracking. She says nothing. The retrieved sample is damaged, but Oliver confirms it may still be salvageable with time. The act ends with the crew returning to the ship in silence. Emily watches Ana closely, beginning to question whether her initial judgment of her was wrong. Meanwhile, the room that Emily found the tapes in has a light flashing next to one of the crewmates names, a distress signal from Ivan, which has been going on for months.

Act Three opens with a flashback: a young girl stands in a hospital corridor with her father. Doctors speak quietly to him while the girl stares through a window at a room where a woman lies motionless beneath a sheet. Her expression is eerily blank. The father, his face never shown, explains that the woman is dead, that she was the girl’s mother. The child does not respond. On the drive home, the father tells her, gently but firmly, that they cannot dwell on this, that they must move on and not talk about it again. His voice betrays his grief even as he avoids it. The girl remains silent; only the slightest welling of her eyes suggests feeling beneath the surface. The audience does not yet know who she is. The story cuts back to the present aboard the ship. Several days have passed. Oliver and Ana examine the salvaged plant sample, but Oliver has made little progress and is growing frustrated. A restrained argument breaks out between them, touching on unresolved tensions from their shared past, before Emily enters. When she asks about the sample, Oliver dismisses her concern. Emily instead raises a practical issue: one of the ship’s engines requires maintenance that will take several days and would be safer to complete on a planet. Ana considers their options and proposes a detour to a nearby planet she and Oliver have visited before—stable, resource-rich, and suitable for both repairs and Oliver’s research, suggesting that resources there could even help with the sample. Emily hesitates about deviating from the plan, but Ana waves it off, surprising her with a rare flexibility. Emily softens further toward Ana, while Oliver is visibly relieved by the lack of conflict. They land on the planet, which is strikingly Earth-like. The atmosphere is breathable, the landscape lush and calm. Emily asks why this planet was never seriously considered as a solution for Earth. Ana explains that the planet’s seasons last for years, with winters and summers so extreme they are lethal; they have arrived during a brief, deceptive autumn before winter sets in. Over the following days, Emily focuses on repairing the ship (Ana has to give her access control of the ship, THIS IS IMPORTANT!) while Ana and Oliver gather resources for the sample. During downtime, Emily and Oliver explore the planet together, laughing and enjoying its beauty. Ana watches from a distance, still reserved, but no as cold. She treats Emily less like a subordinate and more like a teammate. During one outing, Ana discovers something she missed on previous visits and becomes convinced there may be microbial life beyond plant matter. Emily volunteers to accompany her, partly out of curiosity and partly because she is growing increasingly fascinated by Ana herself. As they search, their conversation begins professionally, but when Emily thanks Ana for saving her life weeks earlier, something shifts. Ana initially deflects, keeping it formal, but eventually opens up. As they walk, the two exchange fragments of their pasts. Ana speaks about her strained relationship with her father, shaped by emotional distance and unspoken loss. This hints that Ana's desire involves a theme of denial about her situation. Emily, in turn, shares her experiences with workplace trauma and her complicated relationship with her mother, revealing that during the war she left a co-worker to die during an attack on their base. This hints at Emily's martyr complex, how she pushes to help others so much because she feels immense guilt for leaving her co-worker behind. Neither fully unpack their pain, but there is recognition and understanding between them. It is during this quiet bond that the audience realizes the girl in the opening flashback was Ana. They discover evidence of life—bacterial, not sentient—but still significant. The moment feels hopeful, with Ana collecting samples of the bacteria and saying it's worth studying. They return to the ship changed, more aligned than before. While Ana and Emily were exploring, Oliver briefly noticed something troubling in the ship’s systems: a faint distress signal bearing Ivan’s identifier. He expertly disables the signal, implying he’s done it before. But it doesn’t shut off, turning from orange to red. Panicked, he covers it over with a blanket and leaves it, saying nothing. Back together, the crew’s dynamic is noticeably warmer. Ana is less rigid, even allowing moments of familiarity with Oliver. Oliver announces progress on the sample, and the three share a rare moment of celebration. Emily feels genuinely fulfilled, for the first time, she feels she belongs. As they resume course to the next planet, Oliver continues testing. One day, Emily enters the same storage room Oliver was in to log planetary data. As she prepares to leave, she hears a soft, irregular blinking. Curious, she removes a covering from a dormant console and finds Ivan’s distress signal still active. Shaken, Emily immediately brings Ana and Oliver to the room. She explains that the signal is real and appears to be coming from a nearby planet. She insists they investigate and bring Ivan back. Ana shuts it down instantly, claiming it’s a malfunction and turning the signal off. When Emily presses further, Ana deflects and urges Oliver to back her up. His hesitation only deepens Emily’s suspicion. The tension escalates into a heated argument. Emily accuses them of avoiding the truth. Under pressure, Oliver lets something slip, just enough to make everyone pause. Ana freezes. Emily realises the horrifying implication: Ivan didn’t disappear. He was left behind, on purpose. Ana snaps, ordering Emily to drop it. Instead, Emily uses her control of the ship (I told you it was important) to lock Ana and Oliver out of the ship’s navigation and control systems, isolating command access. She refuses to restore control until they tell her the full truth. Forced into a corner, Ana and Oliver explain their version of events. They describe Ivan as unstable, obsessed with studying a dangerous alien species on a planet they previously visited, unwilling to abandon his research even when ordered. They admit they left him there intentionally. Ana frames it as a necessary decision, portraying Ivan as reckless—possibly delusional. Fragmented flashbacks accompany their explanation. Emily is devastated. The betrayal cuts deepest with Ana after their seemingly heart to heart. She demands they go back for Ivan. Ana refuses outright. When Emily declares she will go alone, Ana physically blocks her. The argument turns violent. The two fight through the ship, colliding with equipment and causing damage. Oliver attempts to intervene but is injured in the chaos. Emily breaks free and reaches an evacuation pod. Ana pounds on the door, first appealing to logic, then to emotion, growing increasingly desperate and manipulative. Emily realizes too late that the pod requires external authorization to launch. Outside, Oliver stands at the control, his hand near the button that launches the pod. Ana begs him not to press it. Emily silently pleads from behind the glass. After a long, unbearable moment, Oliver presses the button. He chooses this out of his own agency, not panic. The pod launches. Emily does not restore control to the ship. Ana and Oliver are left stranded, powerless, as Emily disappears into space. The remainder of the act follows Emily alone. She pilots the pod toward Ivan’s last known location, arriving nearly out of rations. The planet is eerie, almost horror like. As she explores, grotesque figures emerge, creatures that resemble dead humans. Terrified, Emily runs, panics, and falls. Alone, hurt, and starving, she spirals into regret, convinced Ana was right and that this was a mistake. Then she collides with someone. Emily looks up. Standing over her is Ivan—alive, battered, feral with fear. Act Three ends.

Act Four opens in the immediate aftermath of Emily’s escape. On the spaceship, there is no explosion of anger, only silence. Ana leans against the glass wall where the evacuation pod once was. Oliver stands frozen near the launch button. For a long moment, neither speaks. Oliver finally tries to say something, but Ana cuts him off quietly: “Why did you do that?” Her voice is fragile, almost broken. Oliver can’t answer. She asks again. When he still says nothing, Ana crosses the space between them, grabs him by the collar, and the tension finally breaks. They argue violently, not just about Emily, but about years of unspoken guilt, shared responsibility, and choices neither of them fully owned (All relating to leaving Ivan on the planet). Both end up crying, panicked by the realization that they no longer have full control of the ship. The argument ends unresolved, with Ana storming out and Oliver left alone in the cockpit. The story cuts to the planet. Emily encounters Ivan, who thinks she's attacking him and starts attacking her out of self defence. She manages to calm him down just long enough to explain who she is, but before anything meaningful can be said, Emily collapses from exhaustion and hunger. While unconscious, she drifts through fragmented dreams tied to her past traumas, her co-worker and stuff with her parents. When she wakes, she finds herself in Ivan’s crude hideout. Ivan is physically present but emotionally distant — muttering to himself, studying the evacuation pod blueprint Emily carried, asking technical questions but refusing to explain anything about how he ended up here. She notices that his fingers are blue and one of his eyes are black. He is clearly unstable. Emily begins to doubt herself, wondering if Ana was right about him after all. Hoping to gain leverage (or understanding) Emily leaves to search for the evacuation pod that Ivan is interested in. While doing so, she stumbles across a large, abandoned structure and realizes with shock that this planet was also studied by humans. Confused and unsettled, she enters the building. Inside, she encounters the planet’s “aliens,” discovering they are sentient and communicate with one another in a language eerily similar to human speech, fragments of Russian, Chinese, and English blended together. She hides, trying to escape unnoticed, but eventually finds herself in a room filled with old human equipment and recorded tapes. The creatures discover her. This time, they don’t immediately attack. One of them, visibly less deteriorated than the others, speaks to her in English. Emily is stunned. As they speak, with Emily asking the alien questions, another creature enters the room, far more decayed, and suddenly becomes violent, attacking Emily. Emily flees into an adjacent projection room and locks herself inside. Trapped, she plays the tapes. Emily discovers the truth: these are not aliens. They are humans. Grotesquely mutated by long-term exposure to the planet’s atmosphere and an incurable virus that slowly erodes the brain, causing aggression as it progresses. The recordings reveal a secret program from World War Three, run by the Director, Ana’s father, which placed prisoners, political enemies, and “expendable” civilians on distant planets to test survivability. The program was designed as a contingency plan for global collapse. When Earth was devastated by a nuclear strike and communication broke down, the program was abandoned and eventually repurposed as the current program Emily is working in. The humans on these planets were left behind to die. Emily breaks. She vomits, collapses, and sobs, overwhelmed by the realization that the mission she believed in is built on atrocity. Suddenly, Ivan appears and forcibly pulls her from the building. Outside, Emily is silent, barely responsive. Ivan finally begins to talk haltingly, as if confessing something he’s been carrying alone. He explains that he tried to help the people here but failed. The infection is incurable. The most aggressive among them attacked him, forcing him to amputate his own leg to survive. He explains that when they landed he, Ivan wasn't obsessed about there being aliens but rather hellbent on exposing the truth about the atrocities committed here. Ana refused. She claimed ignorance, saying her father told her the program used volunteers who were safely returned, but ultimately admitted she couldn’t allow her father’s reputation to be destroyed. Oliver hesitated, conflicted, urging caution rather than action. When a crisis arose near the ship, Ana made a choice: she left Ivan behind. Oliver resisted, then gave in. He talks about Ana and Oliver briefly, however. Emily is shattered by this. She insists they have to help the people on the planet, no matter the cost. Ivan warns her it’s dangerous and likely futile, but Emily doesn’t care anymore. She returns to the building and promises the survivors that she will expose the truth. Ivan hesitates, then follows. Meanwhile, back on the ship, Ana and Oliver appear again in brief, tense scenes threaded through the act. They are barely speaking. Oliver attempts distraction, avoidance. Anything to keep from confronting what they’ve done, but it fails. Eventually, Ana focuses on the practical problem: navigation. Using her experience as a pilot, she discovers a way to reroute the ship using previously traveled pathways, even without full control. Her first instinct is to leave, to put as much distance between themselves and the planet as possible. Oliver stops her. He argues, not emotionally, but simply,that leaving is worse. Worse than staying. Worse than facing Ivan. Worse than facing Emily. Ana doesn’t respond at first. Eventually, she changes course. The ship redirects, moving back toward the planet. The act ends with the spaceship approaching the planet from orbit, while on the surface Emily and Ivan begin forming a plan. Ivan remains hesitant and deeply afraid. Emily is resolute, no longer concerned with her own safety, only with the truth.

Act Five opens with a flashback from Oliver’s point of view, revealing what truly happened the day he, Ana, and Ivan first landed on the planet. They find the humans and the humans tell them everything. Ivan wants to expose the company, Ana however is more hesitant. The two argue and it results in Ana leaving the planet with Oliver, actively choosing to leave Ivan behind. The focus is on Oliver’s silence and complicity, contextualising his guilt and setting the emotional tone for the act. The story then cuts to the present. Ana and Oliver land on the planet, following Emily’s tracker. Oliver leads for the first time, taking initiative while Ana remains withdrawn and silent, allowing him control. He suggests they stay together no matter what. Ana quietly agrees, though she knows it’s already too late—their bond fractured the moment she abandoned Ivan. Meanwhile, Emily and Ivan locate the evacuation pod. Ivan confirms he can repair it, though it will take time, which allows them to properly gather evidence. During this process, Emily finally realises that Ivan is infected with the same degenerative virus affecting the planet’s human inhabitants, details she’d previously noticed but never connected. Ivan is resigned to it; Emily is not. She insists they will find a cure once they return to Earth. Ivan challenges her motivations, asking why she’s sacrificing everything for this. Emily answers that it’s “the right thing to do,” but when pressed for something deeper, she has no response. They are interrupted by movement. Both freeze as Ana and Oliver emerge. The four stand in silence. Emily is shocked and deeply hurt at the sight of Ana, though she masks it. Ivan is openly terrified. Oliver is hit with the full weight of guilt at how broken Emily and Ivan look; Ana feels it too, though she can’t articulate it. Oliver is the first to speak, apologising directly to Ivan. When he steps forward, Ivan recoils, ready to flee, but Emily stops him. Oliver backs away, respecting the boundary. Emily then states plainly that she knows everything and intends to fix it. Ana attempts to say they’re there to help, speaking in detached, impersonal terms, but Emily shuts her down, telling her she’s done enough damage. Ivan suggests leaving altogether, but Emily instead decides that Ana and Oliver need to see the consequences. She brings them back to the research facility. Inside, Ana and Oliver confront the mutated humans and the evidence left behind. Both are visibly shaken. Ana admits she never knew the full extent of the program AGAIN, and while Emily believes her, she makes it clear that Ana still enabled the system that allowed it to happen. Emily shows them the tapes. Oliver breaks down, finally realising that his silence was a choice, and a wrong one. He offers to help, apologising through tears. Ana remains quiet, emotionally shut down. Emily assigns Oliver and Ivan to organise and secure the logs while she records Ana’s testimony. She tells Ivan they’ll use the spaceship instead of the evacuation pod, allowing them to transport both evidence and survivors. Still wary, Emily keeps copies of the logs herself. As Ivan and Oliver work together, they talk. Oliver apologises without asking for forgiveness. Ivan doesn’t forgive him, but he listens. It’s not reconciliation, but it is honesty. Emily confronts Ana alone. Their conversation is raw and brutal. Ana initially lashes out defensively, then collapses under the weight of it all, finally admitting the atrocities she let happen. Some of the humans speak to her as well, angry, but clear that her father bears the greatest responsibility. With the evidence secured, Emily announces they’re leaving using the ship. Oliver agrees immediately. Ana says nothing, panic simmering beneath the surface. Ivan then reveals he is staying behind. Some of the humans will stay too. He believes there is nothing left for him on Earth and that the infection will kill him regardless. Emily argues desperately that a cure is possible. Ivan refuses, quietly admitting that he no longer wants to be cured. Ana finally speaks, trying to reach him. Ivan snaps back that thanks to her, he’s realised how disposable his life always was. The moment is framed not as justice, but as a deep injustice, something said that cannot be taken back. Ana breaks. Desperate for control, she declares they are not leaving. She says she wants things to go back to how they were, that she hates herself for destroying the only happiness she’s ever known. She threatens the logs, but no one truly believes she’ll go through with it. Emily pulls Ana aside into the log room and tells her to stop—accept that actions have consequences. Ana responds by turning the confrontation physical. The two fight brutally, emotionally, without restraint. Emily overpowers Ana, pinning her down and choking her as Ana repeats that she gives up, that she’ll give them the ship. Emily doesn’t stop, until she remembers her coworker, her parents, the cycle of violence. It's shown here that Emily may be the reason her father died. Her father was highly abusive, and Emily retliated against it by smashing a bottle on his head in self defense. He left the house and never came back. She thinks back on this moment and she releases Ana. Emily takes what she needs and prepares to leave Ana behind. Oliver intervenes, hysterical but resolute, insisting Ana must come back as she is evidence herself. Reluctantly, Emily agrees. They leave the planet with the logs, survivors, Oliver, Ana, and Emily. Ivan stays behind. In the aftermath, the truth is exposed. At first, the public is split, the company tries to cover everything up, people don’t believe it. But then videos and photos are shown. The Director is arrested, along with the company’s leadership. New scientific teams take over. Oliver’s sample becomes the foundation for restoring Earth’s ecosystem, a slow process, but a real one. Oliver testifies, accepting the fallout that comes with it. He stays with the company to help with the sample. Ana testifies as well. She is stripped of her titles, reputation, and power. Everything she built is gone. Emily reunites with her family and dedicates herself to rebuilding the Earth, developing machines that restore soil and ecosystems. Ten years later, Earth is visibly recovering. Emily thrives professionally, though she carries a quiet heaviness. After a day at work, she unexpectedly runs into Oliver. They share coffee, reminisce, and speak of the past. Emily admits she doesn’t know what became of Ivan. Oliver hesitates, then reveals that he only came to ask that she talk to Ana, who sits on her deathbed. Emily is upset at this, at the fact that Oliver and Ana are still in contact, but after some convincing, she agrees to think on it. Oliver asks to remain in contact, but Emily doesn’t answer. Emily visits Ana a few days later. They speak through a glass wall as Ana’s disease is infectious. They talk briefly, awkwardly. The exchange ends with Emily saying she enjoyed their time together, but she cannot have Ana in her life again. And Emily leaves, even while Ana weakly asks her not to. The story ends with Emily at work. She sees a sprouting plant in the soil. She looks at it, her expression neutral, before smiling softly and turning away, continuing her work.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

What tricks have you found that make AI actually think instead of just answering?

🩸Powers and Abilities:

Blood Zero: (Special Move)
A powerful move that has broken abilities no hybrid can defeat, such as the Blood Zero ability Blood Absorb. He uses this move to release his blood and stab the opponent faster than light speed, having the blood absorbed by his own blood and released back into his body, including the opponent’s blood also. He can even absorb maximum blood from the opponent to cause them to become weaker in battle. 

Blood Chaos is an ability and powerful move that can cause powerful destruction and hurt the opponent, causing them to lose all their strength and even affecting their regeneration and other healing factors. 

Blood Shards Ultimate is an ability where he lays his hands on the ground and causes the ground to rise huge blood shards, stabbing everything around him. This move can rise high up into the sky or below and even underground with no mistake, and this power can even cause the opponent to lose their skin and their whole defense. Lastly, this power force is about 80,000,000,000 of pure strike.

Blood Ultimate Barrage: (Special Move)
A powerful move that Deroze uses and a powerful ability that shoots billions of blood everywhere, causing the opponent to feel pressure in their whole body structure. It has blood surrounding you and takes away any items, weapons, abilities, and powers you have extremely fast in one swoop. Also, this ability can hit with dark, unsettling blood that can absorb your entire body and take all your blood until you are dry and dead. Lastly, this ability can even cause millions of huge hands appearing, made by his own blood, smashing down into the ground hard enough to break you. All of these powers are about 100,000,000,000 per force, and this move is unlimited. He can use it all the time once he is out of options.

Life Force Destruction: (Special Move)
This ability has him raise his hands and cause every life force to turn into stone and break into pieces after being touched by this ability. This move can even hit opponents very fast, faster than teleportation speed, light speed, universal speed, and even time and space speed limits. Lastly, this move is only affected if an opponent hits him with a psychic ability. However, the move of Life Force Destruction can reverse anything back to the target, making it harder for them to strike him with a powerful psychic to hit back.

Speed Holo Dash:
He speeds up extremely fast with powerful blood streaming out of his body, releasing powerful blood that stabs the opponent harshly. This move never fails to strike hard at the attacker, and even canceling it won’t work and still is able to strike you. Also, his speed is so powerful that the Speed Holo Dash can sense attacks endlessly without getting struck.

Teleport Stab Corruption:
He can teleport instantly and stab the opponent, causing them to feel dizziness, illusions of nightmares that scare them, pain, and confusion, which makes them not want to fight back. Also, the teleport stab doesn’t miss, which can cause you to suffer powerful stabs of pain and make you useless to fight back.

Reverse Drain:
He can reverse any attack that strikes him and even cancel it before you even strike at him. The ability is so powerful that it causes your abilities and powers to bounce back at him and teleport back at you with force while never noticing the strike happening. This move can even cause you to lose the maximum of your energy to give him the upper hand on you.

Tough Skin:
He has the ability to turn his body into steel-like form and has resistance to mythical abilities, any space and time abilities, fire abilities, universal abilities, reverse abilities, reality powers, and even resist powerful reverse abilities. All of these abilities only make him stronger. However, he cannot withstand light abilities when he is hit by one.

Infinite Regeneration:
Has powerful regeneration that is tremendously fast and impossible to be completely erased or canceled. This ability always heals him infinitely no matter how many strikes you hit him with, and it grows stronger while you strike at him with full strength. However, this regeneration can be weakened by light abilities, which can mess up his ability to regenerate.

Fire Dark Punch:
A powerful fire punch that is strong enough to completely erase the opponent in one strike. This move can even destroy the entire area, burning down everything surrounding him. It also boosts his attacks when fire is around him with blazing force. However, this ability can be stopped by any water abilities.

Flight Ability:
He is able to fly in the air and dodge powers and abilities more easily when avoiding an attack. His speed is tremendously fast, making it impossible to strike him in the air and causing you to be unable to find the exact time to hit him.

Dark Hand Crush:
Once someone gets close to him, he can instantly crush their head or any body structure hard enough that blood comes out easily. It is strong enough to burst off body parts and affect regeneration when he takes your blood and hits it back at you with hard punches at the end.

Dark Shadow Hex:
He can summon a powerful shadow ball and hit you with overwhelming force of dark energy, making you feel slower in movement when struck. This move can cause destruction to the whole area, breaking it into pieces and burying you underground to mess up your ability to move. It can even stop you from striking and hitting him with abilities, canceling your attack without you noticing.

🤝 Relationships:

Kyrenia: (Good Friendship)He sees Kyrenia as a calm and steady hybrid, and she also sees him as a friend. However, he doesn’t say anything like that to her and respects her powers since he finds them interesting and unique to ever lay his eyes on. He doesn’t act cruel or disrespectful to her, knowing she is a top hybrid powerful enough to beat any hybrid at her level.

Nava: (Good Relationship)He sees Nava as an extraordinary Curse Spirit and is very interested in his powers. He doesn’t really see Nava as a threat to him since Deroze is powerful enough to break anyone who gets in his way.

Derark: (Good Relationship)He doesn’t really think Derark is a threat to him. However, he knows that Derark was made by Ardoze, which he knew, and sometimes goes easy on him in battle since this is Ardoze’s creation.

Ardoze: (Neutral)He sees Ardoze as a villain who creates hybrids using DNA from other people and turning those DNA samples into living hybrids made by Ardoze himself. He thinks Ardoze is too insane for doing such things to people and finds it pathetic but interesting.

Runoko: (Rival)He sees Runoko as a rival rather than a friend and sees him as a powerful opponent to take seriously. He finds his powers very interesting since he can kill people while they are asleep, which is impressive from a villain standpoint that he likes.

J: (Rival / Enemy)He sees J as an enemy and someone he wants to destroy since he sees his powers as worthy of his strength. He also sees potential in J’s power even though he considers him another rival and enemy to erase.

Kojako: (Rival / Enemy)He sees Kojako as nothing more than an enemy and a rival he can finally show his true strength to. He extremely respects Kojako’s powers since they are very hard to counter, and Kojako is a hybrid he has rarely seen come close to defeating his abilities on his own.

🩸Summary Overview:

Deroze Yuvierer is a Demon Overlord and a powerful demon known as The Dark Final Zero. People talk about him through rumors, and some even call him a beast that never dies and keeps fighting with blood and dark-like attacks. Deroze is extremely known for killing about 100,000,000,000,000 people in one day, which is insane by villain records, and no hero has ever stopped him in this feat. The attacks he gave others made him feared. He is known to show up when he senses a powerful fight happening at his level and will show his face to the crowd just to see how the fight goes. He plays dangerously with blood powers that can actually kill you. His strength is impossible to stand up to without the right abilities to attack him head-on, and brute force would be needed just to take him out. He is not just a monster from rumors—he is a legendary kind of villain that should never be crossed, because his brute force is too much for anyone to handle at once.

*I ain’t never seen him myself, but I’ve heard people talk about him. My son has a good story ‘bout him. We got an old huntin’ cabin down in the holler on my property. My son and some of his buddies decided they was gonna go down and spend a week down there doin’ whatever. They spent most of one day wading out in the creek down yonder catching crawdads. They got back ‘round evenin’. Was gettin’ chilly so they told one boy to get a fire goin’. They put their shoes on some sticks round the fire pit so they could dry ‘em off. Then, they decided they was gonna do some shootin’ of a night. They got to carryin’ on by the porch light, when that boy come back. He didn’t have no wood with him. He just sat down on the stoop and was real quiet. Well, my son noticed and ask the boy what’s wrong. The boy said he went round back of the cabin to get some wood from the lean-to and says there was a man sittin’ on them logs. Son went round to see if that feller was still there. Lo and behold, he was. My son went to hollerin’ at him to leave, but he didn’t move. Just turned his head to look. Son took up a splittin’ maul from the side of the house and stepped to him. The man didn’t move. So he raised up and threw that splittin’ maul at him. Missed. Boy says he leaned over from where he sat, picked up that splitten’ maul off the ground. Boy just about wet himself. He went runnin’ back around the cabin and told all them other boys they needed to get, so off they got on their four-wheelers and came back up to the house. That’s when he told me the whole story. I went back down with em next mornin’ to get their stuff. Took my rifle just in case. Strangest thing, all their shoes was gone. Guess he took ‘em. But ya know, I figure if a man gonna rob ya, he’d go in and get the stuff worth some money. We got a whole bunch of tools and stuff in the shed down there. Why would ya steal a bunch wet shoes? Odd deal. Still use that cabin. Ain’t seen him around no more, but we make sure and get fire wood ‘fore dark. Just in case. Had to buy a new splittin’ maul too.*



Denver awakes to the sound of sleet lightly pelting his tarp. Through one of the holes, he sees the grey sky. He stirs beneath and begins to pack what he can under the cover of his blue shield. He puts his new coat on and comes out from under the tarp. The tea from the thermos is still lukewarm as he drinks what’s left. 



He stuffs the tarp and thermos into his trashbag of belongings, hoists it onto his shoulder, then grabs the bag of leftover deer carcass. He tucks the rifle under one arm. He starts the day’s journey with the heavy load. He climbs hills and wades through briers. The sleet persists. 



Denver comes to the foot of a steep hill. The hill is wide. Man made. He looks at the steep incline and to the two bags on his shoulder. He sets down both of them and begins to scale the hill, rifle in hand. It is a difficult ascension, but at the summit, he finds a gravel road. 



He looks down one way and sees the road stretch a long ways before cutting sharply to the right. He looks the other way and sees a small bridge, after which there is a sharp curve to the left. Denver stands in the road thinking. He looks in both directions again, but when he looks towards the bridge, the sleet stops. Denver glances at the sky and nods. He descends back down the hill. 



He hoists both bags back onto his shoulders and follows what he now knows to be the ditch towards the direction of the bridge. The forest floor slowly inclines upwards in this direction. Once he comes to the bridge, he sees where the sharp curve leads. Through his woodland shroud he can make out the distinct shape of a house. He sits and observes. He hears and sees no activity from the house. He hides his bags under the bridge and slowly creeps along the tree line of the road, making sure to remain hidden as he approaches the property.



Eventually, Denver is well within the property line of the house and can see clearly into the large living room window. There are no cars in the driveway, and there are no lights on in the home that he can see. He spies a tool shed out back and a pool covered for the winter. With uneasy breaths, he cautiously steps out from the tree line with his rifle in hand. 



He makes it to the shed, turns the handle and pulls the door outward. Inside he finds cans of gas, various tools, lanterns, and some old kids’ bikes. He looks briefly at the lanterns. They are kerosene lanterns and appear to be long out of use. He picks one up to examine it. It is dry with no wick. The rhythm of his breathing has returned to normal under the concealment of the shed. He sets the lantern back down. He closes his eyes and breathes deeply before he exits the shed, and closes the door.



Denver begins making his way back to the tree line when he glances back to the house. He stares at the back door as he walks. He shakes his head and continues his path back to the woods. At the edge of the trees, he stops and turns back and looks at the door once more. He glances up at the sky. Just grey overcast. He shakes his head and reverses course approaching the house.



The rattled cadence of his breath returns. He peeks inside the windows. One has a curtain obscuring the inside. Through the other, he can see a kitchen and an opening to a living room. He tries the kitchen window. Locked. With hesitation, he tries the curtained window. Locked. He sighs and begins to return to the treeline, but stops as he passes the back door. He stares, the fog of his breath dancing in broken patterns about his face. He looks to his right and left. Tentatively, he presses his ear to the door. Only the low hum of the house’s heating system can be heard. Denver slowly grasps the door knob. As he turns his wrist, he expects to meet resistance like he did with the windows. To his surprise, the knob turns, clicks, and the door pushes inward. 



Light from the outside pours into the unlit house. The door swings silently, Denver catches it just before it hits the wall. He stands still, with his hand still on the door knob. He looks about the house, the warm air inviting him in. He is reluctant to cross the threshold until he looks down at his foot and sees that he already has. He holds the rifle ready.



Boxer steps further inside, the warmth feeling unnatural. His glasses fog up, so he wipes them clean with his shirt. He closes the door silently behind him and looks around the kitchen.



There is a dining room and kitchen divided by a bar. A couch divides the living room from the dining room. On the table, there is a bowl of plastic fruit, salt and pepper shakers, and placemats for four. On the counter he finds a loaf of bread, a tomato, a pack of blue sports drinks, and a stick of butter on a dish. He is drawn to the fridge. It is full of food, drinks, and condiments. The sight of a gallon of milk causes him to linger. As he closes the door, he hears ice rattling inside. His mouth feels dry. 



He opens the cabinets to find a glass. As he reaches for a red plastic cup, he looks back to the pack of sports drinks on the counter. He pulls one from the pack and drinks it straight through. He takes his empty bottle to the fridge and pours some of the milk into it. The leftover bit of blue from the sports drink slightly taints the pure taste of the milk, but Boxer doesn’t seem to notice. He shoves the half-drunk bottle into his coat pocket. 



He moves from the kitchen to the living room. The carpet is white and plush. The furniture all matches with shades of white, grey, and wood tones. There is a TV on the opposite wall of the back door and family pictures on the white walls. He sees a coffee table with coasters and a bowl of candies. His grimy visage contrasts the spotlessness of the house. He appears like an ugly stain on an otherwise untouched blanket of snow.



He makes his way to the other rooms. There is one master bedroom with a large bed and bathroom. Two smaller bedrooms with smaller beds and toy chests. At the end of the hall, he finds a closed door. When he opens it, he finds a set of stairs leading down into a basement. He goes down the steps and flips on the lightswitch. It’s completely finished with an office, playroom, and library. 



Boxer looks at the books. There is a larger green book that catches his eye. When he gets close enough, he can see it’s a guide book for bird watching. He reaches to take the book off the shelf when the sound of the front door stops him. He quickly runs and shuts off the basement light, struggling to keep his breaths and steps silent. 



Upstairs he hears footsteps and a man’s voice. He hears the fridge open and close. The TV turns on. Boxer looks around the dark room for a door to the outside, but cannot locate it. He peers around the stairway corner into the light of the open basement door above. 



He cautiously puts a foot on the bottom step and listens. He hears only the TV. He readies his rifle and gingerly climbs the stairs, his steps quiet and calculated. As he approaches the top, he lays prone on the stairs. He looks down the hall and sees the side profile of a man standing behind the couch that divides the living room and kitchen, watching the TV. He wears a uniform with a large gunbelt about his waist. 



Boxer ducks his head below the highest step and tries to remember where the back door is. The man’s back is to it. Boxer raises his rifle and levels it at the man. Like a snake, he drags himself low across the threshold of the steps and into the hallway. He makes it into one of the smaller bedrooms when the man’s phone rings. Boxer’s heart stops, but he peeks around the door frame. The man pulls the phone from his pocket.



M: Hey, hun… Yeah?... Um, I’m not sure, let me look.



The man begins to turn, but keeps his gaze on the TV for a moment. The man walks to the kitchen and Boxer can hear him looking through the fridge. He tries desperately to keep his breathing quiet. 



M: Hmm, no. Looks like we’re out. Hey, I also need some more of that cream soda… No don’t go today, just put it on the list… Nah, come on home, I wanna see the boys. Been a long day.



The man continues talking as Boxer moves to crouch behind the bar.



M: Yeah. Alright, sounds good, babe. Love you, bye. 



The man walks back into the living room. Boxer resumes his inching crawl down the hallways. As he gets to the end, he can just see the man’s feet resting on the coffee table. He can hear the sound of some beverage being consumed. He keeps his rifle in front of him.



Boxer finally makes it to the back door and rests his back on the wall. The man on the couch is facing away from him. Slowly, he reaches for the handle, his fingers twitching. Boxer looks at the man again and the overcast begins to break outside. Bright sunlight pours in through the windows, including the one in the back door. Boxer can see the glare of the window on the TV. The screen briefly goes black as a show begins. Boxer can briefly see the shape of his own hand in the reflection of the screen.



He retracts his hand, trying to stay silent. He pushes himself up the wall with his feet and levels his rifle at the man. He steps deftly as he comes around the couch, keeping his bead trained on him. When he rounds the sofa, he inhales to speak, but no words escape his lips. 



He finds the man with his eyes closed and head knocked back, snoring. Boxer sighs and lowers his rifle. Then he hears the sound of tires entering the driveway. He can see an SUV pulling in. He quickly makes a quiet break for the door and opens it. As he is stepping out, he sees the loaf of bread on the counter. He looks back at the now sleeping man and the quickly approaching SUV. He grabs the sack and exits the house, closing the door as quietly as his trembling body allows. 



He makes it into the concealment of the forest just as the rest of the family pulls into the driveway. A woman gets out of the driver’s seat and begins to unload two children from the back, two boys. From inside, the sounds of children excitedly pouncing on their father can be heard.

*Grandpa lived in a house down that ole road there. Said it burned down one night when a lantern tipped over. Burned pretty much the whole thing down ‘cept for the basement. Had concrete floors and walls. They decided to build another house further up the property, but didn’t want that basement to go to waste, so they capped it and turned it into a root cellar. When I was a kid we would store a lot of our canned stuff from out the garden in there. Eventually, we stopped puttin’ out a garden, sorta forgot all about that root cellar. We let that road get all growed up and the cap on the cellar got all covered up. Time’s got tough so we ended up havin’ to sell off some land to the government. Think it was part of that national forest deal. Well anyway, we decided we would go and check out that ole cellar before it wouldn’t be on our land no more. Never know, there might be somethin’ in there worth keepin’. Like I said, that road got all growed up, hard to see where it used to be, but we found it. I almost walked past it ‘fore I saw them concrete steps going down in the ground. That was about all you could see there anymore. I could see the door was opened a little. I went down the steps, pushed it open, and shined my flashlight in. Air was pretty stale. That’s to be expected. There was animal bones scattered about. Was a skull or two there that coulda been a coyote or a dog. I ain’t sure. Some were definitely squirrel and rabbit. Was some bigger bones I didn’t really recognize right then. I figured it possible that some coyotes or somethin’ were usin’ this place as a den, got into some of the old produce, maybe hauled some meals back there. My flashlight caught a weird lump towards the back. I got curious, so I walked in real slow like, in case one of them coyotes was still in there. When I got up close to the thing, I was confused… and put off. There was a cot. A bunch of pillows and blankets, all set together to make a little bed. They looked old, but not as old as everything else in there. One blanket coulda been newer. I turned right around and left the same way I came. I guess I shoulda’ called it in, but I didn’t want nothin’ to mess up sellin’ the land off. I figured the government could deal with it. We was plannin’ on movin’ anyway.* 



Returning to the bridge, Denver picks up the bag with his belongings. He takes out the half bottle of milk from his coat and places it inside the bag before drawing the string back up. He looks around for his bag of deer. He doesn’t see it. His brow furrows as he tries to remember where he set it. He digs through leaves under and around the bridge, but comes up empty, muttering through gritted teeth. He looks around, confused and galled. 



He takes a slice of bread from the loaf and eats it while he ponders. As he does, the overcast returns. The sound of sleet hisses in the distance. He rubs his forehead, a loud exhale escaping his lungs. He throws his now single bag over his shoulder, takes one last look around the area and begins pushing further into the brush. He hopes to find a good place for camp before the sleet overtakes him again.

  
  


The sound of sleet and rain grows louder around Denver as he treks through the thick of the woods. The bag over his shoulder grows in burden as his feet drag him forward. The cold air makes his bones stiff. The ground beneath his feet compounds the sogginess as his worn shoes allow water to seep in with each step. The grey of winter is setting in.



He can go on no longer and has to make camp. He finds a fallen limb and sets it in the fork of a tree. He drapes his tarp over the limb to build his temporary home. He spreads out some of the extra trash bags to make a floor. After it is set, he gathers the driest leaves he can find, and sticks of various sizes. He sets to building his fire at the mouth of the tent. Trying to light the wet leaves with his bic lighter proves unsuccessful. 



He opens his bag and pulls out the tin containing the newspaper and book page. He looks through the newspaper clippings, carefully reading each one. The last one is a picture of three boys holding up pine cars and trophies. The caption of the picture reads: Joseph Oliver, 1st place. Denver Collins, 2nd place. Archie Maynard, 3rd place. He looks at the second place boy. He was smiling with two front teeth missing. The grainy black and white picture obscures the car slightly, but Denver smiles as he remembers for himself. 



He takes the newspaper clipping, crumples it, and buries it deep into the damp leaves. He lights it with his bic lighter. The fire catches and the dead leaves join the flame. He feeds the fire as it grows.



He eats a slice of bread as he watches the flame. The ache in his belly reminds him of his lost bag of deer. He reaches into his bag to retrieve his bottle of milk. As he does, his hand touches an unfamiliar form. He grabs it and pulls it out.



A kerosene lamp. He is sure this is the same one from the shed. It is still empty, no fuel or wick. With a furrowed brow, he examines the lamp, unsure of how this curious token found its way into his bag. As he turns it in his hands, he sees scratches at the base. They have a vague inclination of order to them. The crudely scratched pattern begins to emerge in familiar shapes. Letters.

He sets the lantern down and looks through the rest of his bag. Nothing is missing. He tucks it and the rest of his things back into the bag. The sound of sleet continues to assail the air. It is the only sound his ears can find. As he tucks himself in, he double-checks his rifle. It is loaded. He lays down to sleep, though his eyes remain open. His hand grips the rifle.

*There wasn’t no name people called him by. People just know who you talkin’ bout once you start talkin’ bout him. He lives somewhere in them woods, we catch glimpses of him now and then. People blame him for all sorts of things that goes on around here. I guess that could be. I reckon at least some of that’s true. Just hard to believe all of it could be. I can’t say for sure I’m the only one ever has, but I’m the only one I know of that’s heard his voice. Least, I think it was his voice. I don’t know who else it coulda been. I was a little girl then. My daddy says, sissy go feed them dogs, so I did. It was dark out. The dog houses is round back of the house. We got some yard between us and the tree line. When I got there, both dogs was lookin’ straight into them woods. We keep ours tied up, I reckon most do anymore. I thought it strange, but figured it was a coyote, so I was just gonna pour the food in the bowls when I heard somethin’. It was a man’s voice. He was cryin’. I listen to him a while. I couldn’t decide if I was scared or sad. Finally I hollered out there and asked if he was okay. The cryin’ stopped. I hollered again. Nothin’. At that point I decided I was scared. Too scared to move, then. All the sudden the dogs tails curled up and their haunch hair stood right up. I heard that voice again. He sounded scared. Was hollerin' about how he didn’t say nothin’. He said that a couple times, then I didn’t hear him no more. I ran back inside, dropped the dog food on the ground. I hid under my blankets and didn’t sleep the whole night.* 



Denver is efficient when he packs to leave for the morning. He is already moving when the grey sky has begun to diffuse the light of the rising sun. The sleet has stopped, but its cold lingers in the air. His eyes continually scan the crest and trough of the land for deer and other prey. 



Occasionally, he stops to listen. He hears sound in the distance. Something mechanical. Trucks, chainsaws, heavy equipment. He adjusts course and moves toward the worksite. 



As he nears, the movement amongst the trees slowly becomes clearer. Faint inclinations of shrouded forms become the familiar shapes of men and machines. The light is somewhat brighter where the trees are being cleared out as the cover of the trees has been stripped away, laying bare the underbrush and ground. He can see where the loggers’ trucks are parked. He crouches and advances on them. 



Once he is sure no one is watching the trucks, he begins testing their doors. He rummages through the first unlocked vehicle. He finds a lunch box and takes the sandwich. He checks the glove box and finds nothing of use. Then he checks the console. Just CDs and a pen. He takes the small bit of change from the cupholder and leaves. 



He is careful to circumvent the worksite. As it largely sits atop a hill, he makes his way towards the bottom to use some brush for cover. On his way, he meets the mound of a body laying on its side. It appears to be one of the loggers. His back is to Denver.

 

L: Hey, you. I need help. Can you help me? Can you get help?



Denver stops and looks blankly. He rounds the body and sees that the man’s eyes are wide open. He is awake, but his body does not move.



L: Did you hear me? I need help, man. I can’t move. 



Boxer sets down his bag and tucks the rifle under his arm. He squats in front of the man.



B: What happened to you?

L: Came out early this mornin’. Surveyin’ the site for the next cut we need to make. I slipped and hit my neck on a rock. Been layin here ever since. I can’t move. No one up there can hear me hollerin’. 

B: Your truck parked up there?

L: What?  
B: Your truck is parked up there with theirs, ain’t it?

L: Uh, yeah. So what? Are you gonna help me?

B: They see your truck, they know you’re here, someone will come lookin.’

L: Man, why can’t you just go up there and get help? I need help.

B: I don’t trust you. 

L: What could I possibly do to you? I’m paralyzed. 

B: You’re lyin’.

L: I ain’t lyin’. I can’t move, man.



Tears start to streak the logger's face as he talks. 



B: Can’t or won’t?

L: What difference does it make? I’m bleeding out. 

B: You never mentioned bleeding.

L: Alright…



The logger rolls off of his side and onto his back. A large patch of blood is caked in dirt and leaves against this side. He has been shot. 



B: Surveyin’, huh?

L: Man, I just need help. I’ll tell ya the story on the way to the hospital alright?



There is a loud crack. Boxer looks up the hill and a man is running down with a pistol. Another crack. Some dirt and leaves are kicked up behind Boxer. He takes flight into the brush, leaving his bag behind. The man pursues.  



They run some distance. Boxer outpaces the man but not his bullets. Dirt and bark explode from their place at the sound of each crack from his pistol. Boxer hops over a fallen tree and uses it for cover. As he throws the barrel of his rifle over the wooden barricade, the man grabs the muzzle and begins to wrestle Boxer for the gun. 



They roll down the hill. At the bottom, the man is laying on his back, Boxer is on top. He wrestles his rifle away and firmly plants the muzzle into the man’s chin. 



Both of their breathing is heavy and labored. Boxer inhales to speak, when he feels the barrel of the man’s pistol in his stomach. 



B: You shoot that guy back there?

M: Yeah.

B: Why?

M: Who cares?



The man pulls the trigger sharply. Boxer closes his eyes and waits for the crack of a round. Instead, he hears a click, like the unlocking of a door. Boxer opens his eyes. The man’s face is painted with fear. 



Boxer fires. 



After the crack, the woods are silent. The only sound that remains is Boxer’s heavy breath. He stares for a moment at the result of his work. He closes his eyes, turns his face skyward and tries to slow his breathing. He swallows hard and raises himself off the ground. 



He walks back to retrieve his bag of belongings. The logger has a new gunshot wound in his chest. He lays still and silent. Boxer kneels down and looks into the man’s still open eyes. He exhales slowly. His gaze drifts down the rest of the man’s body and finds the boots on his feet. They look new, and close to his own size. 



With a sigh, he carefully takes the boots from the man’s feet and puts them on. He stands to test their fit. The sound of the loud machines at the logging site are still going. They are oblivious to the whole exchange. He uses his wrist to wipe the sweat from his brow. He notices bits of red on his sleeve. He looks at the man once more, shakes his head, and heads back to where the other man still lays.

*When we first got called to that scene in the woods, it was hard to tell what we were lookin’ at. The ground had all been extensively disturbed. One tree had been soaked red, there was buckshot embedded in the trunk. Found the shell the buckshot must have come from, lot of good it did us. Forensics tested the blood and was able to figure out it was human and male, but that was it. The amount of blood at the scene would lead one to assume that there has to be a body. I just don’t see how someone leaves that much blood behind and walks away. My guess is the body got moved. We looked for evidence of such a thing, but we never found a trail. Not so much as a drop of blood outside the scene. Was like the whole thing only existed in that spot and nowhere else. Had everything you needed for a murder investigation, except a body. We never did find one either. We assume that Lillard boy was probably involved, he went missin’ around that time, but hard to be sure. Out-of-towners wind up missing in them woods too. Funny thing, we probably never would have even known about it if Barton hadn’t been surveyin’ that land for government purchase. Just luck that he happened to be out there that day, I guess.* 



He looks upon the body and something seems different. He doesn’t know what it is at first, but he soon catches it. The man’s shirt. His flannel overshirt is gone, leaving just the white undershirt. He looks around to spot the thief, but sees nothing. He is perplexed, but shakes his head. 



Boxer takes one of his trash bags, puts it over the top half of his kill, and ties it tightly around the man’s waist. He ties the excess around the man’s belt loop. Now that the inevitable blood trail is contained, he begins to drag the man by his feet through the crevasse of the holler. The trek is slow as the man’s weight fights Boxer’s steps. 



As he walks, snow begins to fall gently from the sky. The large flakes move through the air and find their place on the freezing ground without a single sound to announce their arrival. They melt against Boxer’s cheeks. 



He occasionally tests the ground with his new boots, but no dirt seems soft enough to dig. The cold is beginning to tighten its grip on the land. He carries on until he eventually comes upon a pond. 



He kicks a rock and watches it disappear into the green water. He tests the water with his finger. It is very cold. He looks back at the burden he has been dragging. He puts his bag of belongings down beside a tree. He drags the man, still half covered in a trash bag, to the edge of the pond. He lays him parallel to the shallow shore and begins to roll him like a log into the murky water. He gets him into the water, but not deep enough to clear the ground. He takes the barrel of his rifle and tries to push him further into the water. This works, but only so far. He searches and finds a tree limb. He uses this to continue pushing the man. He clears the mass from the wet soil of the pond, but he floats. 



Boxer shakes his head and looks around. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead and spots a large rock. He stares for a moment before getting another of his trashbags. He puts the big rock in it and begins to fill it with other rocks he finds. He tests the weight of the bag, takes out some rocks, and tests it again. 



The pond is not large, so he will only need to throw the bag a few yards. He takes the bag in both hands, swings it back and forth a few times and then tosses it. It hits its mark and the rocks rush to the edges of the bag, allowing the empty section to drape over the torso like a coat. Boxer sighs with relief as he sees the success of his effort. The man slowly sinks out of sight. 



After a moment of rest, he opens his bag of belongings and pulls out the sandwich he stole from the logging site. Ham and cheddar with tomato and lettuce. The bread is coated with a thin layer of mayo on the inside. He chews each bite slowly as the snow falls around him. He wonders about the man’s missing shirt. After he has eaten half of his meal, he wraps the rest back up and puts it back into his bag. He hoists the sack of things over his shoulder, picks a direction, and carries on. 

  


For a long time, there is nothing but woods and snow. His progress starts strong but his energy diminishes greatly as the cold and wet begin to bear their weight upon him. Finally, he can go no longer and must stop to make camp. Setting up his tarp is easy, but finding suitable wood for fire is not. 



He looks for wood and most of what he finds is rotten and soggy. He finds some limbs to chop with his old axe. He sets the limbs in place to begin chopping. He cuts the first with great effort. As he brings the axe down for his second cut, he hears an odd cracking noise and feels a jolt in his hands. He looks at the handle and can see a split beginning to form. He squeezes the handle tightly and brings the handle down again. He is able to make a few more cuts before the handle breaks completely. 



He slumps down into his tent and examines at the axe. It is not something he can repair. He will need to find another solution for cutting his fire wood. He looks at the pile he has for the night. It will last tonight, but no more. He begins to build his fire with what little tender he has. He attempts to light the leaves. His bic lighter sparks, but will not light. 



He tries it for several more minutes, but is unsuccessful. A cold wind begins to blow through the woods. He pulls himself further into his coat, wraps himself in his blanket and attempts to conserve as much body heat as he can in his tent. 



He slips into sleep just long enough to miss the return of the sleet. He is awoken by the sound of it pelting his tarp. He sighs in resignation, accepting the worsening of his fate for the night. He notices a strange light illuminating the inside of his tent. It is coming from the open mouth at his feet. When he looks, he also becomes aware of the warmth. The flames of his campfire crackle with life. 



He crawls towards the fire when he is stopped by the feeling of something hard beneath his hand. He lifts the familiar object to his face. It’s his broken axe, the half with the head still attached. His fingers find a strange set of gashes in the wood. He turns the handle over and finds a carving in the wood. His eyes glow in the fire as the letters emerge in his awareness. He has seen it before.

A few small-business-friendly ideas that actually work:

1. **Do something slightly out of routine.** A long lunch somewhere new. A morning walk + coffee instead of a meeting. A change of scenery does more than most “activities.”
2. **Make something together.** Cooking class, pottery, candle-making, even building playlists for each other. Creating > competing, especially for smaller teams.
3. **Let people teach each other.** Have team members host a 20-minute “show and tell” for something they’re weirdly good at—sourdough, spreadsheets, photography, budgeting, whatever. Low cost, high connection.
4. **Volunteer as a group.** Food banks, community cleanups, mutual aid orgs. Doing something useful together bonds people fast and doesn’t require forced fun.
5. **Shared meals with a twist.** Not just “lunch.” Think themed potlucks, cooking together, or ordering one dish per person and eating family-style. Food does a lot of heavy lifting.
6. **Micro-experiences.** Trivia over drinks, group walks, museum afternoons, escape rooms for small teams, casual workshops. Short, contained, no pressure.
7. **Unstructured time (yes, really).** Build in space where nothing is planned. People talk when they’re not being managed.

Rule of thumb:  
If it sounds like something you’d roll your eyes at, your team probably will too. Keep it simple, human, and optional—and you’ll get way more buy-in.",1,1767020671.0,boompop,0,1.0,False

To make the workflow as simple as possible for my new setup, I am thinking about the eureka mignon libra.

Budget is not directly a concern, however I do not want to overspend on kit that is potentially overkill, but definitely do not want to upgrade after a few years. What would you do if you were me?

I spent 20 years reverse-engineering human behavior because I didn't get the manual. Here is the ""Source Code"" to reality I found. (Part 3)","Now that I have your attention, we can talk about completely unimportant things.

Today’s cultural program includes:
1. Why I started writing, what I want, and what this looks like inside my head.
2. The deep meaning behind my theory.
3. A lot of useless information.

This text has no clear structure. It is essentially a stream of my consciousness.

**How did I get to the point where I’m writing this?**

It’s a long story. I will try to drain all the ""water"" and leave the minimum information necessary to understand the context.
It happened in the summer of 2025. It all started with a fateful meeting with an old Friend.
*(Note: I must mention that I use the word ""Friend"" only for exceptional people. I know them perfectly, and importantly, they know me perfectly. Everyone else is a ""comrade,"" ""acquaintance,"" or ""colleague,"" but certainly not a Friend).*

I won’t use real names, but I don’t want to invent fake ones either, so I’ll label the characters in my own way. The Friend knows my life positions well and is fully aware of my worldview. He is one of the few people who has known about my theory for a long time.

**Important detour:**
It is also worth mentioning that I do not use terms like ""currency,"" ""ROI,"" or ""system"" for myself internally. It doesn't matter what you call it. These formulations were chosen simply to explain the essence. You are free to call them whatever you like. The main thing is that it fits into your worldview and that you can attribute any situation to at least one of your currencies. I could describe my theory from the point of view of magic, fortune-telling, psychology, or anything else. But I chose this format because I like it the best.

We need to agree on the basics right now:
* Everyone does everything for themselves (or at least everyone does everything *by* themselves).
* A human is a separate, standalone system.

People are very different. It depends on their family, culture, and that unique set of bruises and bumps everyone managed to acquire. Culture and environment throw their rules of the game on top. In one place, it is customary to walk over heads to be respected; in another, it is customary to be humble and helpful. We simply learn to survive and receive pleasure (that very payoff) in ways that worked in our past.
Therefore, when it seems to us that another person is behaving strangely or illogically, most likely, for them, it is absolutely normal. They just have a different set of instructions in their head, written by their past. We have different maps of the terrain, so we choose different routes.

**This reminds me of an old parable that perfectly describes this bug in perception:**

— King, judge us! He says one thing, and I say another!
Solomon listened to the first one and nodded: ""You are right.""
He listened to the second one, who said exactly the opposite: ""And you are also right.""
The scribe couldn't stand it: ""But King! They contradict each other! They cannot both be right at the same time!""
Solomon looked at him and answered: ""You know... you are right too.""

And Solomon is right here, too.

Anyway, I got distracted. We were talking about the history of creating this ""project.""
So, we are sitting there, discussing his problem. I seem to have helped a little, and he says:
— Why aren't you helping others yet?
— What do you mean? — I ask.
— Well, we talked, and I immediately felt better. You said a long time ago that you would push this to the masses.
— You know the context. It's easy for you to understand my words. But how do I convey this to a person who knows nothing about it?
— You were able to explain it to me, which means you can explain it to others.

Then there was an hour-long discussion about the feasibility of such actions. This thought did not leave my head. Initially, I planned to become rich and successful first, and only then start promoting my ideas. But one fine day, I decided to act.

More than one person wrote to me that this is all a stunning marketing campaign, and some even believe that I am not alone, that a whole team is working here. I am very flattered that my work is evaluated this way.

Of course, **being a systematic person, I decided to approach this efficiently. If I'm going to do it, I might as well do it on a large scale.** It all started with planning.
I began to study options for promoting my ideas. First, a concept was developed. A decision was immediately made to broadcast to an English-speaking audience. I had an X (Twitter) account; I set it up and started writing something there, as recommended on the Internet, with the aim of gaining subscribers and transferring them to Substack later.
In the first days, it went well, but then I got shadow-banned (too much activity), and I had to look for other methods of attracting an audience.
It so happened that during this period I met another friend, with whom I decided to discuss this dilemma. He was very glad that I finally decided on such actions and recommended that I write a post on Reddit. I liked this idea, and we started creating the text for the first post.

Fortunately, I already had a practically finished text, which only had to be slightly corrected and translated into English. I wanted the English version to retain my handwriting — the way I convey information. And **Gemini** helped me with this: I threw in my text and the request *""adapt this text into English without changing the author's idea.""*

This all happened in one day.

*(Note: The goal of the first post was to attract attention and intrigue with my persona. I have quite a lot of experience in negotiations and promoting various products, so in general, I know how it works. If you're going to do something, you need to attract as much audience as possible).*

And then, you know the rest. But what happens next?

**I have three strategic tasks:**
1. Get as much reach as possible.
2. Free up more time for myself so that I have the opportunity to write.
3. Replenish all currencies with the help of this project.

Attentive readers have already seen the financial aspect in the phrase ""all currencies.""
**I won't hide it: any sustainable system must have a positive energy balance.** In the long run, I would like this project to support me. But I do not plan to sell any training courses, audits, breakdowns, and similar shady things. Everything I write will always be in the public domain for everyone. The exception is the possible release of a book, but I still have to live to see that day.

**What am I even trying to convey?**
It's time to become better. This is a theory of thinking. A philosophy, if you will.
The idea is to create an effective mechanic for interacting with your inner ""Self."" After all, you can teach yourself to think better, and this will directly affect the quality of your life. **You don't need to do as I do.** I am just an example of organizing one's thoughts. You, as a separate unique system, must develop your own effective way, and that will be the best thing you can do.

I will try to help with this.
""The Payoff Threshold"" is an attempt to convey information conducive to effective thinking, not an instruction manual.
Everyone must decide if this suits them or not. In any case, there will be those whom this helps.
It is also important to say that this is intended not only for neurodivergent people. Neurotypical people can influence their thinking with the same efficiency. It depends on the specific person.

***

**(Appendix: The Price of Updates. In the language of my theory)**

What does ""changing your mindset"" actually mean?
It’s not just ""thinking positive thoughts."" It is **rewriting the legacy code** your system runs on.

Imagine a person who earns **Symbolic Currency** (Status) by bullying others. In his current firmware: Insulting someone = Profit (feeling of power). His system is stable. He justifies it perfectly.

For him to change, a **Critical System Failure** must occur.
It’s rarely a single ""miracle."" Usually, it’s a cumulative error stack that leads to a crash: he gets fired, his partner leaves him, or he meets someone who destroys his worldview.
At that moment, **Hyperinflation** hits.
All the currency he saved for years (his ""toughness"" and authority) becomes worthless paper. Worse—it becomes **Debt**. What he was proud of yesterday, today causes Shame (negative Moral Currency).

This is why most people revert to their old lives.
When you change your mindset, your internal balance sheet crashes into the red. It hurts. You are spiritually bankrupt.
Most people cannot handle this deficit and roll back to the old firmware just to feel ""solvent"" again.

My goal is to give you the manual to survive this crash and enter a stable market.

**Future Plans**

My next post will be about human relationships, expressed through the prism of love. We will touch on this topic there.

I am not asking you to follow my theory blindly. **I am not a guru.**
Verify everything in practice. If my theory does not work in your life—throw it away. Efficiency is the only criterion for truth.
But you won't know until you try.

I have several friends who used this framework to fix their lives. They are the ones who convinced me to share this with you.

I honestly don't know exactly what happens next. I have a plan, and I am following it.
Writing these posts drains my battery significantly. Since I work 12 hours a day, I realized that a strict ""once a week"" schedule might be impossible for me right now. But I will try to write as often as my CPU allows.

I tried to use as little terminology as possible here; I wanted this text to be simpler. **I intentionally use simple examples. We are not ready for the complex ones yet.**

I think I will split the content into two formats:
1.  **Dev Logs (like this text):** Free-flow thoughts about life in its various manifestations.
2.  **The Source Code:** Unfiltered theory and terminology.

I have already created a **Substack** and **Medium**, where I uploaded my previous two posts and this one.
Also, **today another publication will be released**, which I mentioned above (about Love). I will publish it only on my profile and Substack to avoid spamming the subreddit feed too much. So go to my profile and check it out if you are interested.

I will link all my social networks in my profile, but don't expect an active X (Twitter) feed yet — I simply don't have the resources to do it all.

That seems to be all for now. Of course, I would like to write more, but it is difficult for me to tie it all into one text.

I read on the internet that on Reddit, it is customary to write a TL;DR for long posts:

> **TL;DR:**
> You have to guess. Is this a 500 IQ master plan to sell you a $9999 course? Or is it just an autistic guy who drank too much coffee and treats humans like math problems? **The scary part is: it looks exactly the same.** I leave you in total confusion. But one thing is 100% true: your cat doesn't love you. It is just calculating the ROI of the tuna you provide.

1pyob3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1pyob3q/how_to_flirt_with_women_the_sciencebased/,How to Flirt With Women: The Science-Based Psychology Behind Playful Tension,"So I spent months diving into psychology research, dating experts, and books on human attraction because honestly, most flirting advice is garbage. Everyone tells you to ""just be confident"" or ""make eye contact"" like that solves anything. But here's what I found: most guys don't understand that flirting isn't about what you say, it's about creating a specific emotional state. And yeah, society doesn't help. We're told everything is either creepy or too forward, so most people just freeze up entirely.

After consuming everything from evolutionary psychology papers to stand up comedy theory (weirdly relevant), I realized flirting is actually a skill you can develop. Not some mysterious talent reserved for the genetically blessed.

**The thing about playful tension** is that it lives in the space between serious and silly. Most people make flirting way too heavy. They approach it like a job interview where they need to prove their worth. Wrong energy entirely. Research shows that humor and playfulness trigger dopamine responses in the brain, same chemicals associated with attraction. You're literally making someone's brain light up when you create that vibe.

**Teasing done right** is probably the most misunderstood element. It's not negging, it's not insulting someone. It's observational humor about something trivial. She mentions she's obsessed with her coffee order? ""Let me guess, it's basically a dessert with seventeen modifications and the barista knows your therapy schedule."" You're not actually judging her, you're creating a moment where both of you can laugh. The key is you're teasing the situation, not the person. This builds rapport way faster than standard interview questions about where she works or what she studies.

**The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane** completely changed how I think about presence. Cabane breaks down charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. The flirting application? You need warmth and presence more than power. She teaches techniques for actually being present in conversations instead of planning your next witty line. The book won major business awards but honestly it's better than any dating advice I've read. Her breakdown of different charisma styles helps you figure out what actually fits your personality instead of forcing some pickup artist persona.

**Physical proximity and touch** work on a biological level that most people ignore. There's research from social psychologists showing that appropriate touch increases attraction significantly. We're talking about brief, socially acceptable contact: touching her arm when emphasizing a point, light contact on the shoulder when laughing. It communicates confidence and creates intimacy. The trick is doing it naturally and watching for receptiveness. If she leans in or maintains the contact, green light. If she creates distance, pull back immediately.

**The Art of Charm podcast** has some genuinely practical episodes on this. Jordan Harbinger breaks down body language, vocal tonality, and how to read social cues without being weird about it. One episode covers ""assumptive language"" which is insanely useful. Instead of ""Would you maybe want to grab coffee sometime if you're free?"" you say ""We should check out that new cafe, are you free Tuesday or Thursday?"" It's not pushy, it's just assuming mutual interest and making logistics easy.

**BeFreed** is an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University that creates personalized audio content from top psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews. Type in what you want to improve, like social skills or communication, and it pulls from its expanding database of science-based sources to generate a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan. You can adjust the length from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and pick a voice style that keeps you engaged, whether that's something energetic for the gym or calm for evening listening. The app includes a virtual coach named Freedia that you can ask questions mid-episode or chat with about specific challenges you're facing. It's been useful for internalizing concepts from books like The Charisma Myth without having to sit down and read, perfect for learning during commutes or workouts.

**Vulnerability beats performance** every single time. This is counterintuitive because we think we need to impress people. But psychologist Brene Brown's research shows vulnerability creates connection. In flirting terms, this means admitting something genuine instead of maintaining a perfect facade. ""I'm actually terrible at pool but it looked fun"" beats pretending you're good at everything. It gives her permission to be human too instead of feeling like she's being evaluated.

**Energy matching matters more than people realize.** If she's high energy and excited, you don't respond with low monotone answers. If she's more reserved and thoughtful, don't bombard her with aggressive enthusiasm. This is basic social calibration that somehow gets lost when attraction enters the equation. Mirror her pace and tone while still being yourself, it creates subconscious rapport.

**Exit gracefully and leave her wanting more.** This is from Robert Greene's research on seduction (not manipulative, more like understanding psychology). Don't overstay the interaction. When the conversation is at a high point, that's when you suggest exchanging numbers or making plans. ""This has been fun, I need to meet my friend but let's continue this over drinks."" You're creating anticipation instead of draining all the energy from the interaction right there.

The real skill isn't memorizing lines or routines. It's developing social awareness, emotional intelligence, and genuine playfulness. Those are transferable to literally every area of life. You become more charismatic overall, not just when you're trying to flirt.

Hey Reddit!

My partner and I (both 29) are looking to expand our social circle and figured New Year’s Eve is the perfect time to start. We’re hosting a chill house party at our place on the Western Line and would love to invite another couple or two to ring in the new year with us.

A bit about us:

We have two very friendly dogs, so being a dog lover is a must!

We love good food, a solid playlist, and meaningful conversations.

We aren’t looking for a wild club vibe, just good music, great company, and a relaxed atmosphere to welcome 2026.

Who we’re looking for:

A couple (ideally mid-20s to early 30s) who vibes with the above.

Pet-friendly folks (feel free to ask if you can bring your own furry friend, though we'll need to do a ""vibe check"" for the dogs first!).

People who enjoy a mix of ""chilling out"" and ""good chit-chat.""

If you’re tired of the overpriced NYE club scenes and want to make some new friends, drop a comment or DM us with a little bit about yourselves! We’d love to grab a quick coffee or hop on a call first to make sure we all vibe. ",2,1767020097.0,mumbaimeetups,0,1.0,False

1pyo8hu,https://i.redd.it/mzb15v8np5ag1.jpeg,The Hosts of CreepCast are no longer human.,"The warehouse always smelled faintly of metal and coffee. It wasn’t a bad smell, just wrong for morning. The air in the studio was cool enough that Isaiah could see his breath when he first unlocked the door. A thin trail of vapor, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

He flicked on the lights. The room answered with a harsh buzz. The LED strips glowed a little too white, washing the color from his skin. He rubbed at his neck. The flesh there felt cold and papery, though he didn’t think much of it.

The neon sign on the back wall sputtered to life.

CREEPCAST.

The orange light wavered before settling, casting a dull reflection across the table. The foam panels around the room swallowed sound. The silence that followed was thick enough to make him aware of every motion — the click of the laptop booting, the whisper of cables sliding against the desk, the static flutter as he switched the soundboard on.

He cracked open an energy drink and took a long swallow. The liquid tasted metallic, sharper than usual like he was drinking penny water. When he set the can down, he caught his reflection in the dark monitor across from him. The eyes staring back looked bloodshot. He blinked and the red vanished.

Routine steadied him.

Project file open. Gain levels checked. Mic one, mic two, ring lights. He hummed to test the reverb in the space and watched the audio bars bounce green. The hum sounded lower than it should have, as if his throat had sunk deeper.

He went to the glass door and peered into the gray parking lot. Empty.

10:42 a.m. 8 years into the podcast, and Hunter still couldn’t show up on time. 

Isaiah stood there longer than he meant to, staring at the asphalt through the haze of morning light. The air outside rippled faintly, as if heat were rising from it, though the temperature was cold. He realized he was pressing his fingertips against the glass too hard — when he pulled them back, faint smudges were left behind, almost greasy.

The door creaked open behind him.

Hunter stepped in, hoodie half-zipped, the faint smell of fast food trailing with him. “Morning, Dr. Audiofile,” he said, voice bright as ever. But his skin looked pale, almost gray under the lights. The veins in his neck were faintly visible, a map of bluish lines. 

Isaiah forced a laugh. “You’re late.”

“You’re paranoid,” Hunter said, kicking the door shut. “Traffic. And maybe I stopped for food.”

“You always stop for food.”

“Starving artists gotta eat.” He grinned, teeth faintly discolored from coffee. Maybe it was the light in the room but his gums looked grey. 

They moved through setup together. Isaiah adjusted the ring light; Hunter aligned the mics. The familiar motions steadied them both. Still, there was a faint smell — not quite rot, not quite iron. Like the residue of something burned.

Hunter rubbed his forearm absentmindedly, skin flakes dusting the table. “Cold in here today.”

Isaiah nodded. “Feels weird, right? Like the air’s too dry.”

They laughed it off.

When everything was ready, Isaiah hit record.

The red light blinked on. Cameras, mics, mixer — all alive.

“Welcome back to CreepCast,” Isaiah said, his voice warm and smooth. “The only show where the mayonnaise is, and I quote, the sauce of the aristocrat.”

Hunter groaned. “We are not bringing that back.”

“It’s tradition.”

“It’s trauma.”

Their laughter bounced clean through the room. The sound was perfect — crisp, intimate. They could almost forget the chill.

They flowed from story to story. Haunted truck stops. Cursed phones. Listener submissions about ghosts in drainpipes. Their rhythm was easy. Each time Hunter leaned forward, the ring light caught in his eyes, and for an instant the whites looked dull, almost clouded. Isaiah noticed but said nothing.

At the forty-minute mark, Isaiah leaned closer to the mic. His throat ached faintly. He heard a whispering hiss underneath his own words. It wasn’t feedback. It had a shape to it, like someone imitating him a breath too late.

He froze.

Hunter kept talking. “You good?”

Isaiah forced a grin. “Yeah. Just checking the levels.”

He turned a knob and the hiss vanished, or seemed to. The air was still cold, though. The LED light flickered once, and in that brief dimness, Hunter’s skin looked wrong — stretched too tight, as if thinned by light itself.

The red recording light blinked off.

“That’s a wrap,” Isaiah said.

Hunter leaned back, cracking his neck. “That one felt solid.”

“Yeah.” Isaiah rubbed his throat again. His fingers came away with a faint trace of red, like rust powder. He wiped it on his jeans before Hunter could see.

The silence afterward was heavy. Somewhere in the speakers, the faintest hum continued — a note that hadn’t existed before.

“Do you hear that?” Isaiah asked.

Hunter listened. “Just the building settling.”

Isaiah nodded, but he knew it wasn’t the building. It was lower, rhythmic, like breath passing through a mouth that wasn’t quite human.

Isaiah stayed behind to handle the edit. Hunter never liked post-production, claiming his creative genius ended when the mics went off.

The quiet that followed a recording always had its own gravity. The hum of the equipment, the faint aftertaste of energy drinks, the ghost of conversation still clinging to the air. Isaiah liked it that way — the world reduced to sliders and sound waves.

He slipped on his headphones and opened the raw session file.

For the first half-hour everything sounded clean. Their usual rhythm, the joking interruptions, the way Hunter’s laughter cracked halfway through a story. The comfort of predictability.

Then, at thirty-four minutes, a noise caught his ear.

He paused the track and rolled it back.

At first, it was nothing more than static — a shallow, shifting hiss. But as he amplified it, the noise bent itself into a rhythm. Almost a breath. Almost a voice.

He leaned closer to the monitor.

The whisper was faint but deliberate, the syllables stretching like air pulled through wet cloth.

“Isaiah.”

His own name.

He froze, replayed it again, slower this time. The whisper repeated. Soft. Intimate.

His pulse ticked faster.

He soloed Hunter’s mic to see if it had come from there. The channel was clean. The voice was isolated to his own feed, whispering directly under his laughter.

He frowned, rubbed his face. “No way.”

He scrolled back and forth on the timeline, but the cursor started to lag, moving even when he lifted his hand from the mouse. The project kept playing on its own for half a second before stopping.

Isaiah stared at the screen. Then he saved and closed it.

The room had grown darker without him noticing. The LEDs still glowed white, but everything beneath them looked drained — gray tables, gray floor, the faint reflection of his own face caught between screens.

He stood, stretched, and felt a sharp ache in his knuckles. When he flexed his hands, the skin made a soft cracking sound. He turned them over and saw that the color had gone pale, almost blue.

He rubbed his fingers together. They felt dry, the skin rough like sandpaper.

He blamed it on the air. On the long hours.

He packed his bag and stepped toward the exit.

The neon sign at the back of the room still burned orange. He could have sworn he had turned it off. The glow crawled over the metal panels, dimming and brightening in uneven waves.

Isaiah unplugged it, waited, and watched the light fade. The sign’s outline stayed visible for a few seconds longer than it should have — an afterimage that seemed carved into his vision.

Outside, the sky had gone gray. The parking lot stretched empty in all directions, but something about it felt distorted, as if the depth had flattened.

When he got to his car, he looked down at his palms again. The veins looked darker now, almost black beneath the skin.

He tried not to think about it.

His phone buzzed just as he started the engine. A message from Hunter.

“Yo, are you editing that weird whisper yet?”

He frowned, thumbed back:

“What whisper?”

“The one under my track. Sounds like me laughing when I’m not talking.”

He stared at the message for a long time.

“Probably bleed,” he typed.

“Sure,” Hunter replied. “But it laughed after I did.”

No more messages came.

When Isaiah got home, the static hum of his refrigerator sounded almost like the room’s hiss from earlier — low, steady, alive.

He lay in bed, staring at the dark ceiling, and caught himself breathing in sync with the noise.

When he finally fell asleep, he dreamt of microphones. Their black mouths opening wider, cords twisting across the floor like veins.

By dusk, Hunter was already back at the studio. He claimed he had forgotten his water bottle, but the truth was simpler: he didn’t like being alone in his apartment after hearing that whisper in his audio.

The warehouse looked different at night. The orange tint of the city light pressed through the frosted windows, turning the dust into floating amber grains. The studio’s walls seemed closer, like the panels had crept inward.

The air carried a faint odor — iron, ozone, and something older.

When Isaiah arrived, the first thing he noticed was the smell.

“Man, you leave food in here?”

Hunter looked up from the console. His face was pale beneath the ring light, his eyes sunken in more than usual, skin slightly glossy as though damp. “No,” he said. “I came back to check something. Thought maybe we left the mics on.”

“You hear the whisper too?”

Hunter nodded slowly. His voice sounded rougher, deeper. “It said my name. Then yours. I tried to delete the track but it wouldn’t.”

Isaiah moved closer. On the monitor, a new project window was open. The cursor crawled across the screen on its own, tracing empty waveform space.

“Hardware bug,” Isaiah muttered, leaning in. But the closer he looked, the clearer the static sounded. The same slow breath, soft and wet.

The studio lights flickered.

Hunter lifted his hand to his face. “Do I look weird to you?”

Isaiah hesitated.

The skin around Hunter’s eyes had taken a dull yellow tint, veins branching outward like roots. His lips looked dry, cracked at the corners with fresh blood threatening to peak out. 

“Yeah,” Isaiah said finally. “You’re pale.”

“You too,” Hunter replied quietly. “Like the blood’s gone out of you.”

They stared at each other in the reflection of the monitor, both faces ghostly in the glow. The colors looked wrong — too muted, too even.

Isaiah reached out and touched the edge of the desk. The metal felt sticky. When he lifted his hand, faint residue clung to his fingertips.

“What is this?”

Hunter didn’t answer. He was watching the waveform move. A faint green pulse, perfectly timed with their breathing.

“Is it recording?” Isaiah asked.

“I didn’t hit record,” Hunter said.

Their microphones began to hum.

Both of them froze.

The sound was subtle at first — a low drone rising and falling like a tide. The red recording light blinked even though the interface was closed.

“Hunter,” Isaiah whispered. “Unplug it.”

Hunter reached for the cable, hesitated. “What if—”

The speakers crackled, cutting him off. Their laughter from that morning spilled into the room, warped and slowed.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

The words stretched and twisted until they became nothing but breath and vowels.

Isaiah yanked the power strip. The lights died, plunging them into darkness.

For a moment, there was nothing — only the faint breathing of the equipment.

Then a sound came from the far corner of the room. A scrape, like nails dragging across the floor.

Hunter turned on his phone flashlight.

The beam caught the edge of the soundboard. The cables were shifting, inching across the concrete, coiling together like snakes.

Isaiah grabbed his bag. “We’re done for tonight. Let’s go.”

They backed toward the door. As they passed the glass window, both caught their reflections.

The shapes staring back weren’t quite right. The faces were theirs, but the mouths hung slightly open, teeth too long, the eyes shining faintly like wet coins. Hair so thin it looked as though it belonged to a newborn. 

Isaiah turned away first. “It’s the lighting.”

“Yeah,” Hunter said, though his voice trembled. “Lighting.”

They stepped out into the cold night. Neither looked back.

But as they walked to their cars, the orange glow from the warehouse followed them — reflected in the windows, pulsing slow as a heartbeat.

The next night, the city was wrapped in mist. The industrial district looked drowned in it, every light a blurred halo. Isaiah’s car headlights barely pierced the fog as he pulled into the lot.

He told himself he was only returning to grab the hard drive, maybe to make sure everything had actually shut off. But guilt was a quiet pressure behind his ribs. He hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the way Hunter’s skin looked, about the sound that had followed them out the door.

The warehouse was dark except for the faint orange glow seeping through the frosted windows. The CREEPCAST sign was still on, pulsing unevenly.

Inside, the air was colder than the night outside. The hum of the soundboard was gone, replaced by a slower, deeper vibration, like breath trapped in metal.

He closed the door behind him. “Hunter?”

His voice echoed thinly across the room.

No response.

The main monitor glowed across the table, its light spilling over empty chairs and cables. The session project was open again. The cursor was moving by itself, tracing across the waveform. The bars pulsed in perfect time with the faint vibration in the air.

Isaiah’s skin prickled. He stepped closer.

On the track names he saw the file titles had changed:

	•	22\_11\_HUNTER.wav

	•	22\_12\_ISAIAH.wav

	•	22\_13\_HUNTERISAIAH.wav

He reached for the keyboard to stop it, but the playhead kept sliding forward.

“Hunter?” he called again, quieter this time.

A sound came from the booth — a low scrape of a chair.

He turned.

Hunter sat at the far end of the table, headphones still on, his head tilted down.

“Jesus, you scared me,” Isaiah said. “What are you doing here? I thought you left.”

No answer.

Isaiah took a step forward. The light from the monitor found Hunter’s face.

He stopped breathing.

Hunter’s skin had grayed almost completely it was nearly translucent, veins standing dark against the surface. His lips had thinned, cracked wide at the corners. His eyes looked glassy, the pupils shrunken to tiny pinpoints. Beneath the skin at his neck, the faint movement of something pulsing could be seen — veins or cords twitching with a rhythm that wasn’t human.

“Hunter?”

The word came out like a whisper.

Hunter lifted his head slowly. The skin under his eyes stretched tight as he moved, almost tearing. “It’s still recording,” he said. His voice was low and hollow, like it had to crawl up his throat. “I tried to stop it.”

Isaiah stared. “Man, you need to go to a hospital.”

Hunter’s eyes flicked to the screen. “It doesn’t want me to.”

The monitor’s glow flickered, washing the room in alternating pale and orange light. Each flicker showed Hunter’s face slightly differently — sometimes too long, sometimes the skin drawn back a little farther, the mouth opening just enough to glimpse blackened gums.

Isaiah forced himself to move. He stepped around the table to the console. “I’m shutting it off.”

Before he could touch the keyboard, the speakers hissed. The hum grew louder, layered with faint laughter. Their own laughter, played back slower and slower until it dissolved into a gurgling tone.

Then the voices began to blend.

“Welcome back,” the speakers said. Both of their voices, together, distorted and thick.

Isaiah jerked back. “That’s us.”

Hunter nodded weakly. “It learned how to talk.”

The microphones swiveled on their stands with a mechanical creak, facing them. The cables along the floor twitched as though pulled by breath.

Hunter whispered, “It wants us to keep recording.”

Isaiah shook his head. “No. We’re leaving.” He turned toward the door.

The knob didn’t move.

He hit it harder, but it only rattled in place. “It’s locked.”

“Did you lock it?”

“It locks from the outside,” Isaiah said.

Behind them, the neon sign flared, bathing the room in a deep orange light. The air rippled. The speakers released a sound like inhalation.

Hunter stood slowly. His movements were jerky now, like a marionette learning balance. The smell that followed him was sickly-sweet, rot mixed with electricity.

He touched the edge of the table, and where his fingers pressed, the laminate darkened with oily residue.

“Isaiah,” he said, his tone uneven, “don’t fight it. It’s almost done.”

His teeth glinted — longer now, crooked, a shade of gray that caught the light wrong.

Isaiah backed toward the door. “What did you do?”

“It’s not me.” Hunter’s neck jerked as if a spasm ran through it. “It’s us.”

The computer’s display began to distort, image bending like melted glass. The waveform split into two moving tracks labeled HOST 1 and HOST 2. Both pulsed in time with their breathing.

The hum turned into words again, layered, closer:

“Do not stop.”

Hunter’s chest hitched. A long breath shuddered out of him, whistling through his teeth. His fingers flexed, nails blackening at the edges.

Isaiah lunged forward, grabbed the power cord, and yanked.

The room exploded in static.

The noise was unbearable — shrieking, grinding, wet. It pressed through the air like heat. Isaiah fell back, clutching his ears.

Then it ended.

The lights flickered once.

The neon sign went dark.

The speakers whispered, barely audible:

“Keep recording.”

Isaiah opened his eyes.

Hunter was still standing, frozen in place, mouth open, chest barely moving. The whites of his eyes had turned gray, the pupils swallowed by shadow.

For the first time, Isaiah noticed that his own hands were trembling, veins black and raised. Beneath his nails, the skin had started to crack. He rubbed at it frantically, flakes of skin coming off like dry seaweed.

The air stank of metal and old blood.

He looked at Hunter, who was staring back now — a faint smile creeping across his torn lips.

“We’re still live,” Hunter said, voice warbling.

The microphones leaned closer.

The red light blinked on.

The hum thickened until it was nearly tangible, vibrating through every panel of the studio. The air shimmered with heat and static, the faint orange light from the neon sign pulsing like a dying heartbeat.

Isaiah crouched by the wall, hands over his ears. The soundboard lights flashed erratically, throwing color across his face — green, gold, red — until everything merged into the color of blood.

Across the table, Hunter stood motionless, head tilted toward the ceiling as though listening to something above them. The skin of his neck had stretched thin; dark veins climbed up toward his jaw. His mouth twitched open and closed like he was mouthing silent words.

The microphones hissed again, their stands creaking. They leaned toward him, close enough that the edges of the foam brushed his lips.

The sound that came out wasn’t human. A slow, rasping syllable that broke apart before becoming a word. The speakers echoed it immediately, layering it into something deeper.

Then both channels began recording again. The screen glowed with new files forming:

HUNTER.wav

ISAIAH.wav

HOST\_1.wav

HOST\_2.wav

Isaiah forced himself to stand. His knees cracked. The smell of rot clung to him — his own body breaking down. The veins in his arms had turned black, the flesh around his knuckles splitting like dried fruit.

“Hunter,” he said, voice hoarse. “We have to stop this.”

Hunter turned toward him slowly. His eyes had clouded completely, the pupils gone. When he smiled, his teeth looked cracked and gray, the edges sharp like stone.

“It’s still going,” he said. “It needs us.”

The studio’s lights flickered again, faster now. The room seemed to breathe — walls expanding and contracting, the air shifting in waves. Each breath carried the smell of rust and old meat.

Isaiah stumbled back against the wall. His reflection glimmered faintly in the glass of the control booth. He almost didn’t recognize himself. The skin of his face had lost its tone, lips darkened, eyes sinking into shadow. The sound that came from his throat was wet and low.

He wiped at his mouth. His fingertips came away with a thin smear of black.

The speakers erupted with laughter — their laughter — looped and distorted.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

“…where the mayonnaise is…”

“…the sauce of the aristocrat.”

The voices overlapped until they became a single, toneless murmur.

Hunter stumbled forward, one hand clutching the edge of the desk. “It’s finishing the episode,” he said.

The microphones swung toward them. The red recording light turned steady. The waveform on the monitor began to pulse, keeping time with their movements.

The speakers whispered, “We are the hosts.”

Isaiah’s stomach twisted. He felt something crawling beneath his skin, threading along his ribs and into his neck — cords tightening, pulling him upright. His breath came out in shudders. His voice cracked open on instinct.

“Stop,” he whispered. But even his whisper echoed through the speakers, deeper than it should have been.

The echo answered: “Keep going.”

His knees buckled. The cables on the floor had begun to shift again, inching toward his feet, wrapping lightly around his ankles. The rubber was slick, warm to the touch.

Across from him, Hunter had fallen to his knees, breathing in short bursts. Every exhale came out as a wheeze. His skin had gone gray and sunken; his fingers ended in dark nails that clicked against the floor.

Isaiah watched in horror as Hunter’s jaw spasmed open. The flesh around his mouth split slightly at the corners, black liquid beading along the cracks. Isaiah watched as Hunter vomited his innards onto the floor into a mess of melted intestines and softened teeth. Resembling that of tapioca pudding. 

Through the pain, Hunter managed to laugh — a wet, thick sound. “It’s… us.”

The laughter continued through the speakers, looping in perfect sync.

“We are the hosts.”

“We are the cast.”

“We are still recording.”

Isaiah felt his spine stiffen as if cords had been threaded through it. His skin burned. His teeth ached against his gums. The pressure in his head rose until he could hear nothing but the vibration of the neon light.

Then his vision doubled.

He saw Hunter across from him — but also saw himself from Hunter’s perspective, as if their eyes had merged. The screens flickered between them, each reflection slightly out of time.

They moved together without meaning to. Both leaned toward their microphones, skin tearing faintly at the necks, breath rattling in their throats. The smell of decay thickened until the air itself tasted metallic.

Hunter’s voice came out first — a distorted blend of whisper and growl. “Tonight’s episode…”

Isaiah’s mouth opened against his will. “…is about voices that never stop.”

The lights flared once more, searing white.

The microphones began to hum in harmony, the cables tightening around their bodies, binding them to the table.

They kept speaking — slow, uneven, almost ritualistic — as their faces caved inward and the flesh along their arms darkened like charred paper.

“…haunted gas stations…”

“…mirrors that talk back…”

“…voices that don’t die…”

Each phrase dissolved into static.

Their eyes turned white. Their skin dried into ash-gray texture, lips receding to reveal cracked teeth. The glow of the monitor painted their faces in the same dead light as the waveform’s pulse.

Still, they smiled.

When the sound finally dropped to silence, both stood completely still. The wave on the screen flattened into a line. The file saved itself automatically:

The Hosts That Creep Their Casts.wav

Two hours long. Perfectly complete.

For a long moment, nothing moved.

Then, slowly, both figures lifted their heads.

Their eyes reflected the monitor’s light.

From their blackened mouths came the faintest whisper, perfectly synchronized:

But for our gifts, it’s like she goes to Amazon and finds the cheapest quality to get us. I asked for some new 49ers shirts for Christmas from her and the one i received, San Francisco was spelled wrong. My husband went on Amazon and found it and it was $4. My husband also got a shirt that he couldn’t even get on and it also had typos. The price doesn’t matter. My SIL got me and my daughter both gifts from the thrift store this year that are some of my favorite gifts. 

Another thing that doesn’t make sense is that i sent her screenshots this year of what i wanted (even found them on amazon because i know that’s where she shops).

1pyo7g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1pyo7g3/bilingual_blitz_30_six_short_exercises_to_test/,Bilingual blitz [30] (six short exercises to test your Italian),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer*, but I will read and evaluate all participants.  

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise more recent posts.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""All they can do right now is listen and obey""  
**A2)** “Ah, darn! Some of it got in my eyes!”  
**A3)** ""That was a good joke! Tell me another one""  

**B1)** ""Paese che vai, usanze che trovi""  
**B2)** ""Non sarà poi molto affilato, però è appuntito""  
**B3)** ""Bisogna saper valutare ogni caso a sé, senza far di tutta l'erba un fascio""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 1 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all six sentences, I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes without evaluating.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of scores depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the exact range might change depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

I spent 3 days at his house and came back the Friday night and went to our own homes.   
  
I was not able to give him the present as it was too big and I couldn't carry it. So, I texted on Saturday asking him if he wanted to meet soon to open his gift. His immediate answer was ""Yes, but not Today or Sunday. I need to take a break after Christmas, haha."" I did not make a deal out of it, as it is understandable that we spent 3 consecutive days, even though I did not like that he responded immediately with a strict rejection.   
  
Later that day, he told me that he is going to meet a female friend of his and get coffee on Sunday at his place. Side note: I do not like this female friend, as she was very mean to me when we first met, and I asked him repeatedly to maybe introduce me to her many times before so that I could get to know her better, and not with that one bad experience we had, but that is another story. I texted him, ""I thought you wanted to take a break from socializing,"" and he answered, ""Can you just one time not make me feel bad for meeting other people?"" which is not true. I have always been okay with him going out with his friends, etc., which he did just last week without any issues from my side. I find it very unfair that he said that, as it was not about going out with others, but going out with others after saying he has no energy for me. I did not want to explain my emotions again, as we had that conversation before about how he says no to me sometimes; it is too direct. So I ignored and talked about something else. BUT i still feel rejected when he tells me he doesn't have energy to meet, but anytime he says that he has energy to do things with other people (it is mostly that specific female friend). I try to understand that maybe he needs a break from me in a way, and try not to overreact, but when he immediately responded to my offer to meet negatively, but was so willing and motivated to spontaneously meet that friend of his. It made me feel like I am too much for him, but other people aren't in cases, or that friend has more of a priority. I feel like it would have been different if he had communicated it differently in the beginning.  
  
I also feel like it was a good opportunity for me to meet her. I texted him, sad that I still didn't get to meet her properly, and he ignored that message, which also made me question why he doesn't let us meet. ",6,1767019568.0,AmIOverreacting,37,0.87,False

(Part 3)","Now that I have your attention, we can talk about completely unimportant things.

Today’s cultural program includes:
1. Why I started writing, what I want, and what this looks like inside my head.
2. The deep meaning behind my theory.
3. A lot of useless information.

This text has no clear structure. It is essentially a stream of my consciousness.

**How did I get to the point where I’m writing this?**

It’s a long story. I will try to drain all the ""water"" and leave the minimum information necessary to understand the context.
It happened in the summer of 2025. It all started with a fateful meeting with an old Friend.
*(Note: I must mention that I use the word ""Friend"" only for exceptional people. I know them perfectly, and importantly, they know me perfectly. Everyone else is a ""comrade,"" ""acquaintance,"" or ""colleague,"" but certainly not a Friend).*

I won’t use real names, but I don’t want to invent fake ones either, so I’ll label the characters in my own way. The Friend knows my life positions well and is fully aware of my worldview. He is one of the few people who has known about my theory for a long time.

**Important detour:**
It is also worth mentioning that I do not use terms like ""currency,"" ""ROI,"" or ""system"" for myself internally. It doesn't matter what you call it. These formulations were chosen simply to explain the essence. You are free to call them whatever you like. The main thing is that it fits into your worldview and that you can attribute any situation to at least one of your currencies. I could describe my theory from the point of view of magic, fortune-telling, psychology, or anything else. But I chose this format because I like it the best.

We need to agree on the basics right now:
* Everyone does everything for themselves (or at least everyone does everything *by* themselves).
* A human is a separate, standalone system.

People are very different. It depends on their family, culture, and that unique set of bruises and bumps everyone managed to acquire. Culture and environment throw their rules of the game on top. In one place, it is customary to walk over heads to be respected; in another, it is customary to be humble and helpful. We simply learn to survive and receive pleasure (that very payoff) in ways that worked in our past.
Therefore, when it seems to us that another person is behaving strangely or illogically, most likely, for them, it is absolutely normal. They just have a different set of instructions in their head, written by their past. We have different maps of the terrain, so we choose different routes.

**This reminds me of an old parable that perfectly describes this bug in perception:**

— King, judge us! He says one thing, and I say another!
Solomon listened to the first one and nodded: ""You are right.""
He listened to the second one, who said exactly the opposite: ""And you are also right.""
The scribe couldn't stand it: ""But King! They contradict each other! They cannot both be right at the same time!""
Solomon looked at him and answered: ""You know... you are right too.""

And Solomon is right here, too.

Anyway, I got distracted. We were talking about the history of creating this ""project.""
So, we are sitting there, discussing his problem. I seem to have helped a little, and he says:
— Why aren't you helping others yet?
— What do you mean? — I ask.
— Well, we talked, and I immediately felt better. You said a long time ago that you would push this to the masses.
— You know the context. It's easy for you to understand my words. But how do I convey this to a person who knows nothing about it?
— You were able to explain it to me, which means you can explain it to others.

Then there was an hour-long discussion about the feasibility of such actions. This thought did not leave my head. Initially, I planned to become rich and successful first, and only then start promoting my ideas. But one fine day, I decided to act.

More than one person wrote to me that this is all a stunning marketing campaign, and some even believe that I am not alone, that a whole team is working here. I am very flattered that my work is evaluated this way.

Of course, **being a systematic person, I decided to approach this efficiently. If I'm going to do it, I might as well do it on a large scale.** It all started with planning.
I began to study options for promoting my ideas. First, a concept was developed. A decision was immediately made to broadcast to an English-speaking audience. I had an X (Twitter) account; I set it up and started writing something there, as recommended on the Internet, with the aim of gaining subscribers and transferring them to Substack later.
In the first days, it went well, but then I got shadow-banned (too much activity), and I had to look for other methods of attracting an audience.
It so happened that during this period I met another friend, with whom I decided to discuss this dilemma. He was very glad that I finally decided on such actions and recommended that I write a post on Reddit. I liked this idea, and we started creating the text for the first post.

Fortunately, I already had a practically finished text, which only had to be slightly corrected and translated into English. I wanted the English version to retain my handwriting — the way I convey information. And **Gemini** helped me with this: I threw in my text and the request *""adapt this text into English without changing the author's idea.""*

This all happened in one day.

*(Note: The goal of the first post was to attract attention and intrigue with my persona. I have quite a lot of experience in negotiations and promoting various products, so in general, I know how it works. If you're going to do something, you need to attract as much audience as possible).*

And then, you know the rest. But what happens next?

**I have three strategic tasks:**
1. Get as much reach as possible.
2. Free up more time for myself so that I have the opportunity to write.
3. Replenish all currencies with the help of this project.

Attentive readers have already seen the financial aspect in the phrase ""all currencies.""
**I won't hide it: any sustainable system must have a positive energy balance.** In the long run, I would like this project to support me. But I do not plan to sell any training courses, audits, breakdowns, and similar shady things. Everything I write will always be in the public domain for everyone. The exception is the possible release of a book, but I still have to live to see that day.

**What am I even trying to convey?**
It's time to become better. This is a theory of thinking. A philosophy, if you will.
The idea is to create an effective mechanic for interacting with your inner ""Self."" After all, you can teach yourself to think better, and this will directly affect the quality of your life. **You don't need to do as I do.** I am just an example of organizing one's thoughts. You, as a separate unique system, must develop your own effective way, and that will be the best thing you can do.

I will try to help with this.
""The Payoff Threshold"" is an attempt to convey information conducive to effective thinking, not an instruction manual.
Everyone must decide if this suits them or not. In any case, there will be those whom this helps.
It is also important to say that this is intended not only for neurodivergent people. Neurotypical people can influence their thinking with the same efficiency. It depends on the specific person.

***

**(Appendix: The Price of Updates. In the language of my theory)**

What does ""changing your mindset"" actually mean?
It’s not just ""thinking positive thoughts."" It is **rewriting the legacy code** your system runs on.

Imagine a person who earns **Symbolic Currency** (Status) by bullying others. In his current firmware: Insulting someone = Profit (feeling of power). His system is stable. He justifies it perfectly.

For him to change, a **Critical System Failure** must occur.
It’s rarely a single ""miracle."" Usually, it’s a cumulative error stack that leads to a crash: he gets fired, his partner leaves him, or he meets someone who destroys his worldview.
At that moment, **Hyperinflation** hits.
All the currency he saved for years (his ""toughness"" and authority) becomes worthless paper. Worse—it becomes **Debt**. What he was proud of yesterday, today causes Shame (negative Moral Currency).

This is why most people revert to their old lives.
When you change your mindset, your internal balance sheet crashes into the red. It hurts. You are spiritually bankrupt.
Most people cannot handle this deficit and roll back to the old firmware just to feel ""solvent"" again.

My goal is to give you the manual to survive this crash and enter a stable market.

***

**Future Plans**

My next post will be about human relationships, expressed through the prism of love. We will touch on this topic there.

I am not asking you to follow my theory blindly. **I am not a guru.**
Verify everything in practice. If my theory does not work in your life—throw it away. Efficiency is the only criterion for truth.
But you won't know until you try.

I have several friends who used this framework to fix their lives. They are the ones who convinced me to share this with you.

I honestly don't know exactly what happens next. I have a plan, and I am following it.
Writing these posts drains my battery significantly. Since I work 12 hours a day, I realized that a strict ""once a week"" schedule might be impossible for me right now. But I will try to write as often as my CPU allows.

I tried to use as little terminology as possible here; I wanted this text to be simpler. **I intentionally use simple examples. We are not ready for the complex ones yet.**

I think I will split the content into two formats:
1.  **Dev Logs (like this text):** Free-flow thoughts about life in its various manifestations.
2.  **The Source Code:** Unfiltered theory and terminology.

I have already created a **Substack** and **Medium**, where I uploaded my previous two posts and this one.
Also, **today another publication will be released**, which I mentioned above (about Love). I will publish it only on my profile and Substack to avoid spamming the subreddit feed too much. So go to my profile and check it out if you are interested.

I will link all my social networks in my profile, but don't expect an active X (Twitter) feed yet — I simply don't have the resources to do it all.

That seems to be all for now. Of course, I would like to write more, but it is difficult for me to tie it all into one text.

I read on the internet that on Reddit, it is customary to write a TL;DR for long posts:

> **TL;DR:**
> You have to guess. Is this a 500 IQ master plan to sell you a $9999 course? Or is it just an autistic guy who drank too much coffee and treats humans like math problems? **The scary part is: it looks exactly the same.** I leave you in total confusion. But one thing is 100% true: your cat doesn't love you. It is just calculating the ROI of the tuna you provide.

I’m a 16 year old exchange student from Argentina living in Italy, and I’m looking for honest advice because I feel very confused about my relationship with my host family.

I’ve been with them for a little over four months. They are genuinely good people. They take care of me, include me in trips and family events, and have never treated me badly. This is not a story about a toxic or abusive host family. That’s actually what makes this harder.

I want to be very honest about my mistakes.

During the first month and a half, I barely talked to them. When I arrived, I didn’t speak Italian well, didn’t fully understand how their household worked, and instead of investing emotionally at home, I focused almost entirely on making friends outside. At the time I thought that was normal exchange student behavior, but looking back, I realize I was being immature and emotionally absent with my host parents.

On top of that, I also had issues with cleanliness and routines. They talked to me about it, which was completely fair. But at one point they also told me something else: that I didn’t talk, that I seemed closed off, and that they felt ignored. That conversation hit me hard and was a wake-up call. I realized I had been prioritizing friendships while neglecting the people who were actually hosting me.

After that, I genuinely tried to change. I fixed the practical issues, became much more respectful of the house, and made an effort to be present. Over time, something real did grow. We do talk sometimes. We joke occasionally. There are moments where we laugh together, have coffee after meals, or just talk about normal things. I’ve grown attached to them, especially my host mom. There is real affection there, and I do care about them.

At the same time, day to day there are still awkward moments. I’m often quiet at dinner. I overthink what to say. I feel like I’m constantly monitoring myself instead of being natural. It’s not that we never talk. It’s more that the connection comes and goes, and when it goes, I feel tense and disconnected inside.

The holidays made everything more intense.

There were big family gatherings, lots of people, dialect being spoken, and games I couldn’t really follow. I stayed polite and present, but I mostly observed for hours. No one was openly mean, but I felt very much on the outside. At one point someone awkwardly said something like “poor guy, he doesn’t understand anything,” and even though it wasn’t aggressive, it stuck with me and made me feel small.

Now I’m left wondering what is actually expected of me. I don’t know if host parents usually actively include exchange students during holidays, or if it’s normal to just be there quietly. I don’t know if I should push myself to talk more, or if forcing it only makes me more tense and less authentic.

What makes this situation especially confusing is that I want more than just peaceful coexistence. I don’t want to feel like a guest who is just behaving correctly. I want to feel a sense of family, warmth, and mutual affection with them. I already care about them, but I don’t know how to turn that into something that feels more natural and reciprocal, especially with a language and cultural barrier.

So my questions are:

What do y’all think of my situation?

Is this a normal exchange student experience, especially around holidays?

Is being respectful, present, and responsive enough, or is more expected?

Can host family relationships be affectionate but still awkward for months?

How do you actually build emotional closeness and a sense of family with host parents, instead of just “doing things right”?

How do you relax and be yourself when you’re afraid of failing socially again?

If you read this far, thank you. I’m not trying to complain or blame anyone. I’m genuinely trying to grow, repair what I did wrong at the beginning, and understand how to create a real family connection in this situation.",2,1767019132.0,exchangestudents,2,1.0,False

During the meeting, she offered me coffee and asked questions about how I came to this path. I explained that it started with a feeling random, I didn’t fully understand, but I realized it wasn’t wrong when I was 18.

She also asked questions about my family, since I come from a Muslim background. For example, she asked what my mother might say or do if she found out about my path. I said that she might be a little upset at first, but she wouldn’t reject me because she is my mother and my mother said that I will always be her son. Edit: the rebbetzin also asked if my mother was maybe/possibly Jewish. I said that we're from Anatolian village in Turkey, there can't be a Jew there. I don't understand why she asked that and wanted to be sure if my mother can be possibly Jewish or not 

We also talked about conversion. I said that I don’t want to convert right now, but maybe in 5–10 years (edit: because I'm 20) and that I want to learn, observe, and see how it goes with the holidays first. I mentioned that I would prefer to convert in Israel because it seems more difficult in the Netherlands. She replied that it is “possible.” But also said that Jews don't want coverts. At the end of this conversation, she said: “interesting."" 

After that, we had a Hebrew lesson. When we're done, the rabbi was also downstairs; he looked at me and smiled (I think). I was so nervous that I didn’t look at him, acting as if I didn’t see him. Now I wonder if that came across poorly.

Honestly, I’m not sure how to fully evaluate the conversation. Did it go well or badly?

But I do miss having people to share my passions with - chatting about what we're playing, reading, watching, and generally using to cope with adulthood. 

Games I'm into: GW2, FFXIV (sort of on a break, trying to get back - send help), RPGs, visual novels, story-driven games, and the odd seasonal case of gacha self-punishment. I'm taking a break from PGR, WW might be next on the chopping block but we'll see. Lately I've been spending a lot of time in WWM - it scratches that itch for open world exploration with rich lore/culture and a bit of social interaction. Other games I've spent a lot of time in this year: Elden Ring, BG3, NMS, LA. 

All-time favourites: DAO, DDDA, ME trilogy, Code Vein, ToB, .hack// franchise. I'm fond of character-driven narratives and anything fantasy or sci-fi. I've recently replaced my potato PC with a beast, so I might finally start working through my backlog, which has apparently reached meme status among witnesses.

I'm based in Ireland (UTC+0) and usually around in the evenings, with a bit more free time at the moment after quitting a toxic job. I'm partnered and child-free, and I've found I usually relate most easily to others with a similar lifestyle. I'm fairly straightforward in how I communicate, sometimes a bit blunt, so my wording can come across as harsher than I intend. Outside gaming I'm into books, anime, photography, music, and cats. I'm also pursuing a PhD part-time. Frequent insomniac, currently held together by coffee and tea.

I'm not specifically looking for co-op partners - mostly just friendly conversation, with the option of playing together sometimes if it feels natural. If you fancy saying hi, send a DM with a bit about yourself, and we can move to Discord if it feels right.

Ingredients

Salt

8 ounces chives

1/4 cup grapeseed oil (I subbed canola, could that matter?) 

Directions

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and place a bowl of ice water on the side. Boil the chives until tender, 2 to 3 minutes, then chill in the ice water. Squeeze dry and transfer to a blender with the grapeseed oil. Puree on high speed until very smooth and bright green. Transfer the contents to a saucepan and simmer until the liquid stops bubbling, making sure not to fry the greens. Line a fine-meshed sieve with a coffee filter and place over a dry bowl. Pour the oil into the filter and transfer to the refrigerator. Allow it to strain, undisturbed, for about 2 hours, then transfer the oil to a squeeze bottle and reserve, chilled.

It never strained. About half a teaspoon came out. I essentially have chive puree. ",4,1767017977.0,AskCulinary,10,0.83,False

**Tool:** [https://imageedit.brightmind.one/](https://imageedit.brightmind.one/) (adding for context on the feedback)

**The situation:**

* 1,800 users in 3 days from organic Reddit/HN posts
* \~6% actually use it (100+ people uploading/editing daily)
* Zero revenue (it's 100% free, no signup)
* Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, costs me $0 to run

**What it does:** Adds text to images instantly in the browser. Think Canva but only does ONE thing - no bloat, no signup, just works.

**My dilemma:** Everyone says ""just charge for it"" but I'm worried:

1. Adding a paywall kills the viral growth
2. The tool is TOO simple to charge for
3. Premium features feel forced (what would I even add?)

**Options I'm considering:**

* Keep it free, use as portfolio piece for clients
* Freemium: Basic free, $5/mo for premium fonts/bulk downloads
* ""Buy me a coffee"" button
* Light ads (feels wrong though)

**For those who've monetized simple tools:** What would you do? Keep riding free growth or pivot to revenue?

1pynexy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1pynexy/self_awareness_vs_self_acceptance/,Self Awareness vs Self Acceptance,"46 and only self diagnosed for now..... Over the past few years I've done a bunch of screeners and self research that ASD explains a lot of my life experiences.  I'm a civil engineer, I've never really had close friends, and once I'm interested in something, I feel the need to become an expert in it.

As a got older, I've gotten more self aware that certain things will make me have a strong negative reaction.  And in the past few years, I've realized it's likely autistic sensory overload..... Crowds, new places, noise, lights, unexpected events, etc.  I'm much more self aware of how I'm feeling and when something  will be ""too much"".  But I also can't go through life avoiding all the things that are going to push my limits. How does one deal with the feelings that they are responding irrationally to events but not be able to stop the response?  

For example.... My hubby and I go grocery shopping on Sunday mornings and we always get coffee to drink in the store.  He wanted to go to a different store...which I was okay with.  Which meant trying a different coffee shop....which I was also okay with.  But then they didn't have a website, so I couldn't check out the menu.  When we got there, it was a small space, loud, and very busy.  So I felt rushed to order.  My order tasted good, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  And it threw off my whole day to the point of some brief tears. 

I knew it was an irrational response to a minor issue, but I just couldn't move past it.   I know that the holidays and not being on a ""normal"" schedule was a contributing factor.  I can look at the situation objectively and figure out the whys.  But I struggle with giving myself a bit of grace that's it okay to have negative responses and not feel guilty that I'm being unreasonable.

I'm struggling with do I get an official diagnosis at this point in my life so I have the validation that my responses are just part of how my brain works?  I haven't talked to anyone about my suspicions that I have autism...and I'm not sure a diagnosis would change that just because I don't want people to judge me or treat me differently than they do now.
