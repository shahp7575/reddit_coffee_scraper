1pp3syr,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1pp3syr/beer_and_coffee_tastes_disgusting/,Beer and Coffee tastes disgusting,"So I consider myself pretty grown now. I turned 25 this year and have a little bit of experience when it comes to drinking all types of beverages. I like a tasty cocktail, love me some hot chocolate, or anything that just generally tastes good. When I was a kid, I always used to wonder the taste of beer and coffee since all the adults were addicted to it. I tried drinking coffee on a daily basis for a few weeks when I turned 18 and got a job early in the morning. I thought this would be necessary since all the grown ups did it right? My teachers back in high school used to chug down coffee like it was part of their curriculum. I thought I would need it in order to stay up and productive. Well, I tried. And I absolutely hate the taste of coffee. Especially black coffee. What the fuck. Why the fuck. It taste like rancid black powder acid. Why the fuck would anyone torture themselves with that? It only starts to mildly taste decent if I put enough cream and sugar in coffee. Even then, why bother when I can just get a hot chocolate that always tastes good? Same thing with beer. I thought it would be an acquired taste. Obviously tried it for the first time when I was a teenager. Always pretended to like it so that I wouldn’t come off as lame lol. But now after years of trying a few cans whenever there’s gatherings, you know what? Fuck beer and it’s disgusting bitter, dirty water, murky potion like taste. What the fuck. Why the fuck. If you wanna get hammered, fuck it take some shots and pour down a chaser. Better yet, learn how to make a cocktail. The only “beer” I would ever drink happily is those flavourful ones that people market for “women” since men like me apparently deserve the worser things in life.

1pp3snu,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1pp3snu/discover_people_and_activities_nearby_social_and/,Discover People and Activities Nearby; Social and Professional Networking App,"Hi Everyone,

I spent about half the year developing this app which I wanted to solve the issue of knowing who the people around me at networking events and conferences are. Aside from difficulties of going up to strangers to say hi, I always worried I may not have met the people who could have helped me meet my networking goals the best. And at worst, I would get trapped in boring conversations where neither of us wanted to be impolite and break it off sooner than it should have.

So I created Wyrl, an app that puts a geofence around you and shows you who else on the app is in your immediate ares (basically someone you could easily walk up to within a couple minutes). The idea is that the app will help you sift through large groups of people to find the ones who can help you the most, and allow you to prioritize meeting them before meeting random folks who may or may not be able to help you. Safety is a big priority so you get a list view of people, not a map. And you choose at any given moment to be visible to others or not. I used Cursor for the heavy lifting of the app and Supabase and Firebase for the data and push notification assistance. I started with SwiftUI for the first version, but as I was having Cursor translate it to Kotlin, I decided to go with Flutter instead which is what the current app is built on. I added features like IM, business card sharing, event creation (like MeetUp), and also popup activities that end users can create. With popups, anyone can post an activity where they are looking for others to join. For example, lets say you have your chess board and are working at a coffee shop for the day. You could post a popup inviting people to come play chess with you if they're around. The popup will only be seen by people within a couple blocks of your location.

Okay, with that out of the way, I realize that I may have packed a little too much into the app, making it difficult to isolate early adopters who see the value and would start using the app right away (aside from lack of critical mass). I'd love to get feedback especially from those who have needed to scale their apps for the benefits to come out. This is the first app I've vibecoded, and want to solve the issue of helping people discover each other in various situations, especially at conferences. It was a great learning experience, and showed me what is possible given enough time and energy investing in the process.

Please check it out (and have someone nearby do so as well so you can get a better sense for it). Thanks! [wyrl.io/app](http://wyrl.io/app)",1,1765995479.0,buildinpublic,0,1.0,False

Within 6 weeks we've had two drinks spill because 'someone' forgot to extract the cup holders from their recessed position. Coffee went every where and my Kia smells like a coffee shop! Not to mention now the holders are sticky and very hard to turn! There isn't a way to pull it out to wash it so I'm sad.

Anyway - wondering if anyone has found a suitable solution that's a little more idiot proof for me and my family? I was looking at, and hoping there was, an after market accessory that might fit in that space that would make the cup holders a little more static.

1pp3p35,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_strangeshadowstories/comments/1pp3p35/the_one_who_pulled_me_out/,The One Who Pulled Me Out,"I’ve never been the type to believe in the paranormal. Ghosts, spirits, monsters ...none of that ever made sense to me. I was always the “I’ll believe it when I see it” kind of guy. Same with religion. I didn’t hate it; I just never saw a reason to think any of it was real.

That changed last night.

I live in the West End district of Shadow Falls, and I usually go jogging around midnight. It’s quiet, the streets are empty, and it’s the one time of day I feel like I can think. Last night it was raining, but only lightly at first. I almost stayed home, but I convinced myself a little rain wasn’t a big deal.

So, I put on my raincoat, tied my shoes, and headed out.

About fifteen minutes into my jog, the rain got worse. Much worse. It went from annoying to overwhelming in a matter of seconds. The thunder started up, too ... it was loud enough to make me jump once or twice. I kept going anyway, but by the time I hit Ninth Street, the rain was so heavy I could barely see what was in front of me.

There’s a small diner a few blocks from my place, and I figured I’d duck in there until the storm calmed down. I was already soaked, and the idea of standing under a roof sounded good enough. The only problem was crossing the street to get there.

I tried to look both ways, but with how hard it was pouring, I couldn’t see any headlights. It was after midnight, and the roads are usually dead around that time, so I figured the chance of a car coming was pretty low.

I stepped into the street.

That’s when a van came out of nowhere, speeding straight toward me. I didn’t even have time to react. I remember the sound of the engine, the shape of the headlights, and the sudden realization that this was probably it for me.

But then something impossible happened.

I felt this sharp jolt, like a burst of electricity going through my whole body and suddenly the world around me shifted. I blinked once, maybe twice, and the next thing I knew I was standing safely on the sidewalk in front of the diner.

No pain, no impact, no explanation.

I turned back toward the street, confused and shaking, and that’s when I saw it. A figure standing where I had been only seconds earlier. It looked like a person, but its whole body was made of some kind of glowing energy. Bright, flickering, almost like it was made of electricity instead of skin and bone.

It didn’t move. It just watched me.

And then, just as fast as it appeared, it disappeared.

I went inside the diner and sat down. I ordered a coffee but didn’t drink it. I just sat there trying to understand what had happened. I must’ve stared at the wall for an hour.

I don’t know what that thing was.  
I don’t know how it saved me.

But after last night, I can say this much with confidence that there are things in this world I clearly don’t understand.",1,1765995252.0,u_strangeshadowstories,0,1.0,False

1pp3njt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_strangeshadowstories/comments/1pp3njt/i_shouldnt_have_gone_to_redwood_forest/,I Shouldn’t Have Gone to Redwood Forest,"I took a trip to Shadow Falls, Massachusetts to visit a friend of mine from college. He’d just moved there a few months earlier and kept telling me how much he liked it, so I figured I’d come out for a few days and see the place for myself.

The plan was simple. Coffee in Midtown, then a hike in the mountains just outside the city. While we were sitting in the booth at the coffee shop, talking through the details of the hike, I asked him what the trail was called.

“Redwood Forest,” he said. The moment he said it, I noticed someone staring at us.

An older man sat alone in the booth beside ours. He had been drinking his coffee, but now his cup was sitting untouched on the table, his eyes locked on us. Not curious but Focused.

My friend noticed it too.

After a few uncomfortable seconds, we politely asked if everything was okay, if there was something he needed. The man leaned forward slightly and, in a low, raspy voice, said, “You can’t go there.”

We exchanged a look. “Go where?” I asked.

His eyes didn’t blink. “If you go to Redwood Forest,” he said, “you may never return the same again.” My friend laughed nervously and asked him why.

The old man reached into his jacket with a shaking hand and pulled out a pen. He grabbed the napkin beneath his coffee cup and began to draw. He was slow and deliberate. When he finished, he slid the napkin across the table toward us.

It was a trail map.

Not detailed like a real one, but very specific with turns, bends, markings, all laid out in a way that felt intentional.

“If you go,” he said, “you follow this exactly. If you don’t, you won’t make it back.” My friend thanked him politely and said we had plenty of hiking experience. The old man’s posture stiffened.

“You take it,” he said sharply.

His voice became firm, loud enough that a coffee shop employee stepped over to make sure everything was alright. I assured her we were fine. As we stood to leave, I felt a strong instinct telling me not to walk away without that napkin. So, I grabbed it and slipped it into my back pocket before my friend noticed.

As we left, the employee apologized for the man’s behavior. She told us he was a war veteran, a former park ranger, and that he’d been struggling with dementia for years.

I felt bad. I chalked it up to that and tried to forget about it. Then we drove to Redwood Forest anyway. 

When we arrived, it was beautiful, the oak trees were massive. The scenery was very naturistic. The kind of place people go to escape from the outside world. We loaded our backpacks with water, trail mix, and basic supplies, then followed the trail.

At first, everything felt normal.

But the farther we went, the denser the forest became. The trees started blocking out the sunlight, and it got darker fast. Patches of sunlight appeared in the distance, just enough to see where we were going.

That’s when we saw the backpack.

It was torn open, with belongings scattered across the ground like someone had flung it into the air. There was a phone, wallet and Clothes.

None of it made sense.

I picked up the wallet and put it in my pocket, thinking maybe we’d run into whoever it belonged to further down the trail. 

A few steps later, the sunlight hit something else. At first, I didn’t understand what I was looking at as something pale laid across the dirt ahead of us, half-covered in leaves. My brain tried to make sense of it until we got closer, and the shape became impossible to ignore.

It was a leg. A human leg.

Severed cleanly at the thigh, the edges torn and uneven, like it had been ripped away with force instead of cut. The skin had already started to turn gray, covered in mud and darkened blood. I screamed louder than I thought I could. My friend pulled out his phone, trying to get a signal whilst turning in a slow circle.

That’s when the forest behind him went silent.

No wind.  
No insects.  
Nothing.

Then the trees started to separate like they were being forced apart. Tree trunks groaned and snapped as something massive pushed through them. I opened my mouth to warn him, but before sound came out.

A shape emerged from the darkness.

It was enormous, towering above the oak trees themselves. Its fur was thick and matted, soaked in a deep crimson red that looked too dark to be natural. Then I saw its bright orange eyes locked onto us. 

Before either of us could react, it grabbed my friend, lifted him like he weighed nothing, and threw him deep into the forest. I didn’t hear his scream until I was already running.

I ran faster than I ever have in my life. I couldn’t feel the ground beneath my feet. All I could hear were heavy footsteps crashing behind me, shaking the earth with every step. I couldn’t see but I knew I needed to lose this creature, so I jumped off the trail into thick bushes to my right.

The footsteps stopped.

I stayed frozen there, shaking, crying, too afraid to breathe. That’s when I remembered the napkin. I pulled it from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands.

We had been walking in the wrong direction. we went in the complete opposite trail than what the drawn map instructed, so I slowly, carefully, crept back out and followed the path it showed.

And somehow… it worked.

I broke free of the trees and stumbled into sunlight right in front of our van. I jumped inside and sped straight to the Shadow Falls police department.

When I arrived, I told them everything and showed them the wallet.

They confirmed the owner of the wallet had gone missing three days earlier while hiking in Redwood Forest. They told me they’d send a team out to investigate but they never did.

They tried to convince me my friend was lost. That I imagined the creature. That trauma can make the mind do strange things.

But I hadn’t been drinking. I hadn’t taken drugs. I knew what I saw.

A week later, I went back to the coffee shop.

The old man was there sitting in the same booth.

I sat beside him, desperate for answers. Before I could speak, he said quietly:

“The beast that stalks the forest of red  
Eats and feasts on the living and dead.  
Stay alert. Stay quiet.  
Or you will fall to the Red Giant.”",1,1765995154.0,u_strangeshadowstories,0,1.0,False

Mostly asking how to move forward about leaving the job or not.]

Okay here we go.. 

So I'm 18, not sure it matters but yeah just got another job part time working at a sort of mom and pop grocery store (i think that's what it's called, just a family owned grocery store specializing in a.. certain kind of cuisine) and there is also a small ""restaurant"" operating in the back half of the store. 

I get paid $13 an hour to be the single cashier for the grocery store, take orders and payments at the registers for the restaurant, food truck outside, answer calls and also run the small Cafe consisting of making coffee drinks, teas, and street snacks. I'm usually the sole employee there, I have two managers who are sisters and one operates the food truck outside while the other is in the kitchen of the restaurant with a small restaurant staff of abt 3 people. 

Ive worked there about 3-4 months now and am seeing how things go. That brings me to roughly 3 major issues I've found that I've been realizing I can't ignore any longer.

1. Hiring discrimination, ive taken info down of people looking for jobs only been told to subtly throw it away if the person was a man.. (As a trans man who just looks androgynous rn bc im working on affording T this had me side eyeing the managers lol) my manager actually sat me down and said ""just set those applications to the side, its easier to work with women but don't tell anyone since its against the law""...

2. Food dilemma, so I work 9+ hour shifts here and the managers give me a meal sometime during the day with a 30 min lunch break. This meal is usually something from the restaurant, or whatever the kitchen staff are having, usually fried chicken or sometimes even take out from chick fil a, once it was from a local Chinese restaurant. Usually there's no issue, but there's the point of I usually don't get to *choose* what I'm given. I'm Buddhist, but the managers are both Christian. I've told them quite a few times I don't eat beef (bc of religion lol realized I should specify) and once they gave me tofu instead of beef on a meal and I appreciated it. Now last week for lunch I was just handed a bowl of unnamed soup, and it took me 5 minutes of prodding the staff to tell me what was inside this soup (yes it was beef) I politely declined, only for my manager to get upset with me and say if I declined any meal ever I wouldn't be allowed to eat there ever again.. yikes. They said they didn't have time or resources to accommodate my eating habits and would no longer be serving me. I was baffled and replied that I could bring the soup home for a family member and asked if that allowed me to keep eating there and was given no reply...

3. ""Restaurant"" health hazards, the restaurant.. as far as I know has no sanitation rating, only a food handling certificate displayed, but it's legit enough that we take uber/doordash/grubhub orders, have a large amount of regulars and are constantly busy with usually a decent wait for tables. I ate there once before working there and there was a hair in my soup 🥲 (the female staff wear hair nets but not the one male kitchen staff and not the managers), and we've had 2 incidents when I've been working with the same customer finding metal wire in their food. Im not exactly sure what to make of it.. (ive worked in restaurants for 3 yrs and know how nasty shit can be behind the scenes so idk if I'm overreacting)

Here's where i ask for adivce, should I quietly quit working there, or stick it out a while longer and see if things improve (i do actually enjoy working there surprisingly, the customers are friendly and the actual owner is kind). If I do quit should I somehow report the restaurant or the discrimination ive seen? Something inside me urges to do something crazy like protesting outside, but I would feel so guilty since I really like this place from an outsiders perspective.(its the only grocery store for this cuisine in the city and has been around for 15+years and is locally known to be some of the best food of this cuisine around) What would you guys do?

Manager had shut-down the till, and taken cash up to count.

Some of the employees from a section separate to the cafe but part of the same organisation, came a couple minutes past closing time, and asked for coffee.

You see, technically we aren’t supposed to serve anyone after closing time, since we have to rush to clean everything up. But the coffee machine wasn’t totally shut down and cleaned, since I had just made myself a coffee to go with my brownie. So I thought, hell, why not. 

“You can’t pay for it now, do it tomorrow, but I’ll make it for you anyway” (I trust their integrity)

So I made them their coffees. And then a CUSTOMER was waiting behind them. They asked for 2 coffees too. I told them we were closed - the till was closed so I couldn’t serve them. Then she asked if I could take cash, I said, no. But then thought hell, we waste enough coffee beans anyway. So I told her, I still couldn’t take her cash because there would be no way to put it through, but I’d make her 2 coffees on the house. 

This resulted in me being like 10 minutes behind schedule but they were really grateful so I suppose the joy of another human is worth that at least. I’m sure the company would disagree.

A lot of time is spent feeding. I change all diapers immediately. I do some cooing and poking and prodding and sweet faces throughout the day. 

I set him down on a mat that has some dangling toys (he mostly ignores, sometimes touches/bumps or briefly grabs by accident?) or a kickable “piano” he doesn’t realize he’s kicking.

I try to build in 5 min bursts of tummy time (beyond which he starts crying) but aside from setting some objects in front of him that he ignores, or cheering him on for a couple of those minutes, it’s just letting him struggle until he gives up and starts fussing/crying/screaming.

Sometimes he falls asleep when feeding and he’ll lay there on my lap while I browse/type the computer one-handed, or I can shift him to the bassinet for a little bit, but he only sleeps a couple little bursts a day.

I feel like I should be doing more, but also my energy levels aren’t the best (I’m an older parent, and low on sleep and haven’t been exercising since he was born). 

I was walk/“jogging” him in the stroller a lot of days when it was warm but now it’s freezing here. 

I try a baby carrier but after 10 mins he squirms and cries so I’m not sure it’s comfortable enough? I’d love to wear it around the house and do chores / bottle washing wearing him, or go on longer walks where he’s bundled close to me for heat, but he panics after 5-10mins usually.

Should I be doing more? Reading to him?

Give him toys? He has a couple toy things he might briefly hold (accidentally or if we force it into his grip) but they don’t seem to do much for his attention. It feels weird when he just lays there for long periods looking up at the ceiling but also I need those breaks to scarf a protein bar or make a coffee so I let him.

What other ideas/activities/stimulation at 4months? Good toys for 4 months?",1,1765994771.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

With keto, it feels like so much effort finding new meals and then making every aspect of the meal from scratch. Even snacks is tough because i hate seeds and cannot eat cauliflower. It’s especially hard when everyone else in my family is eating normal foods that i love, leaving leftovers in the fridge that i could so easily eat. Of course i wouldn’t eat these things, I’ve found that i am quite disciplined and refuse to cheat on the diet, but it’s getting so hard that i just dont eat anything if i dont want to cook. I am constantly under-eating and if i feel hungry at dinner time i just drink coffee because im so unmotivated and lazy. I guess this was just me wanting to rant i guess. Any suggestions with what i can do to get motivated to start actually cooking and eating my 1200 calories of the day would be appreciated.",2,1765994588.0,keto,3,0.75,False

I've been working on **Grippi**, a mobile game built around one simple mechanic: remembering patterns on a 5×5 grid. No ads, no clutter - just clean, focused gameplay.

**The concept is simple:**

* Three different challenge modes that test your memory in different ways
* **Flow** \- Follow sequences in order (calm and rhythmic)
* **Hunt** \- Spot unpredictable patterns across varying layouts
* **Flash** \- Quick recognition challenges (patterns shown briefly)

**What makes it different:**

* Progressive difficulty that adapts to how you play
* Quick sessions perfect for commutes or coffee breaks
* Daily streaks and stats to track improvement
* Minimal design, no fluff, just the game

The game is currently **in testing phase** and I'm actively looking for feedback on gameplay, difficulty curve, and overall experience. If you enjoy memory/puzzle games with a minimalist approach, I'd really appreciate you checking it out!

1pp3b4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Topamax/comments/1pp3b4y/a_topamax_migraine_success_story/,A Topamax migraine success story,"Like everything else, nobody goes searching their meds online because everything is sunshine and rainbows. I'm no different, I found this subreddit because I had a bad time with my initial side effects, and I wanted to get a better idea of what was normal and what wasn't.

**TLDR:**  
150mg nightly for about three months now. It took my migraines from 10+ monthly down to one or two. My only lingering side effects are brain fog, reduced appetite, flat sodas, and occasional paresthesia.

**The Long**  
I was supposed to be on 75mg/day, but the pharmacy fucked up and gave me 50mg pills instead of 25mg pills. When my neurologist and I discovered this at my one-month checkup, we decided to keep the higher dose, because I was already adjusting to the side effects.

The Bad  
I started out with pretty severe side effects, because of the dosing mistake. I had terrible brain fog - I was forgetting words, had to speak slowly, had to take a couple days off work (software engineer) because of it. I had constant paresthesia all over my face and hands. The flat sodas and appetite loss were also immediate, but, I was about 20lbs overweight, and I figured it was probably a good thing. I also developed a real short fuse, I felt like I had a mild cold (""nasopharyngitis"") all the time, I was always thirsty... it was a long, long list. The volume of side effects was, in fact, how my neurologist and I figured out the dosing mistake. ""You shouldn't have that many side effects on such a low dose."" ""What do you mean low?"" etc.

The Good  
It very nearly stopped my migraines. I had episodic tension-induced migraines. That means they would start out with muscle tension at the base of my head/neck, and turn into crippling pain, and last for 3-5 days at a time. I was getting to more than two or three episodes in a month, and taking enough sumatriptan to be in rebound headache territory, and hating life. Now, when I get a headache, it can usually be stopped by OTC painkillers, and it doesn't come back the next day. I only have to take sumatriptan for the most severe headaches, and that's only once, maybe twice a month. Life is SO MUCH BETTER.

After about six or eight weeks, most of the side effects are gone. Like I said in the TLDR, a few still linger. Roughly in order of severity:

- Brain fog: I used to be incredibly smart. The ""top of every class, valedictorian, summa cum laude, mega nerd"" kind of smart. I now can only keep a single train of thought going at a time. It's still a very sharp train of thought, but I need to write things down or I lose them. For example, I can't really do mental math anymore - my ""party trick"" of splitting a tab or doing tips or whatever has stopped working. Multiplying two numbers and remembering the product? That's three trains of thought. What's left is still smart, but I have to use more tools than I used to.
- Reduced appetite: I've lost 20lbs in three months. I do not enjoy eating anymore, or feel any desire to do so. There's no pleasure in it, it's just what I do to when my stomach starts to hurt from being empty. Some days I forget to eat entirely. I'm keeping a very close eye on my weight, because I feel like this might get out of hand. For now, I'm fitting back into my favorite clothes that I had given up on in the back of my closet, and that part's pretty great.
- Paresthesia: If I do anything that involves constant nerve stimulation (folding clothes, washing my hair, wearing long pants on a run, etc), my skin tingles for an extra half hour. It's annoying, but I'm mostly used to it and can ignore it.
- Flat sodas: Whatever. I miss root beer, but there are so many other things to drink that aren't carbonated. Coffee, tea, juice, Mio, Gatorade, literal water... I'm dealing with it.

Anyway, final thoughts? Yes, it's a hell of a drug. It has significant effects. For me, the intended effects are absolutely worth the side effects, and I'm going to keep taking it as long as my neurologist keeps approving refills.",1,1765994370.0,Topamax,0,1.0,False

Let me preface by saying, I hope you are having a marvelous hump fwy so far!

Okay; as wild as this may sound, I really would love a virtual date…. Don’t know about the logistics or how this would even happen! Haha. Maybe an engaging conversation at first, chat a while and some texting. That being said, after \*\*the small talk\*\* is all out of the way haha!

I don’t mind your age as long as you’re \*\*at least 21+, but to be honest, I love older women, the mature type, mentally and emotionally that is.\*\*

I mostly enjoy all the following;

The beach, any day of the year!

Italian coffee…. Espresso too and French Pastry! (Yeah, I love food haha).

The gym after work.

HBO shows, and all marvel movies (I’m not a Marvel nerd, unfortunately lol).

Not a gamer and don’t know anything about pc/video games lol.

Love pets but do find cats very fascinating… the closest thing to tigers lol.

Love good healthy banter, humor, charm, wit and always attracted to intelligence.

Moderately romantic type, but I do believe a man should always open the door for a lady!

I love to travel.

That’s all I can think of now haha.

Before I forget, I love creativity so if you happened to come up with a fantastic icebreaker then please slide right in my dm and make my day! :)

\*\*Hope you enjoyed reading my post and have a marvelous day\*\*

i also heard someone say it's a call to action and a warning against erasure of culture, with turkish coffee actually being originated in Yemen but is associated with Turks because of the Ottoman Empire conquering Yemen and introducing the coffee to Europe",3,1765994344.0,gorillaz,1,1.0,False

In september I met this guy. Call him SP. I was driving to the train station and tried to park while it was really dark. I did it. Sat in the car and got my lipgloss out of my pocket. A car pulled into the parking lot one left in front of me. I started applying my lipgloss, then noticed the guy in the car was watching me. It was like a movie scene. I stepped out of my car and was shocked at how far my car reached out in the back. I got back in and started driving forward. Stopped. He stepped out of his car. Tall handsome guy. I dont recall all of his facial features, but he was wearing this clean suit and his dark beard stood out to me. He immidiately started showing me, that I could drive further. I rolled up my window and we interacted. After parking, him and I matched energy and went to the train entrance. We talked for about 2 minutes. About me being a newbie at driving and me thanking him. Then he went straight, when I had to go left. He was taking the train in the opposite direction… I thought about him all day. He treated me and talked to me like a princess in those few minutes we had. I wished for us to meet after work at our cars, but his was still there when I went home. I waited for like 15mins but he was not in the next train, so I went home.

Long story short, today I saw his car! I went past it a few times. Regretted not leaving a message like „thanks for helping me, what about a coffee to do my part“. I dont know. Today I went back. Got a coffee. Waited for an hour. He still didnt show up and I had plans.

Now I want to manifest him! I want to meet him again. Get to know anything about him.

I dont know his name, his profession, where he lives, his age, if he is married or single. I just know what his car looks alike. I know his license plate and that made me recognize his car today. I dont even truly remember his face. Only his beard and that I perceived him as quite handsome.


So how could I manifest him? Think of the car possibly? Affirming about seeing him in his car all the time? Or what? I am confused how to proceed. Would be grateful for any advice🙏🙏🙏

I only manifested money once, years ago. So please be kind about me not truly knowing what to do.

I’m here because I feel… well, I don’t even know how I feel. I’m starting to think that maybe I’m actually going crazy. I’ve been with my partner—let’s call them Alex—for almost three years now. Overall, they are a fantastic person, but lately, things have been happening that make me doubt my own sanity.
The latest incident was last night. We were watching that nature documentary on Netflix—the one about wolves in Canada, yeah—and talking about the weekend. I was on the couch snacking on chips, and at one point I asked: ""Remember we said we’d go visit my parents on Sunday afternoon?"" Alex looks at me like I have three heads and says: ""What? No, we never said anything like that. You’re confused; we have to finish organizing the garage, we decided on that.""
To me, I seemed to remember it perfectly. We had planned to spend the afternoon there; we even argued about who would drive. It was a clear conversation—we were in the kitchen while I was making coffee Saturday morning and they were reading the paper. There were even some bills on the table; I remember moving them to make space for them. But now, Alex denies everything with such conviction that I’m wondering if it actually happened. I even searched through our texts, but we didn’t talk about it there. I feel like the rug is being pulled out from under me.
This isn’t the first time. Weeks ago, we fought over a promise they made me regarding a concert: they said we had only ""floated the idea,"" but I was certain it was a concrete promise. In the end, I let it go just to stop the bickering.
Am I Overreacting? Maybe it’s just me being too stressed lately and my memory is taking a hit? Work has been heavy, it’s true.

The formula works alongside caffeine instead of replacing it, using natural ingredients to support fat metabolism and sustained energy. Unlike many weight management products, Java Burn is tasteless and dissolves easily, making it simple to use every morning. It supports metabolic processes related to calorie use and energy production throughout the day. With a balanced stimulant approach, it avoids sudden energy spikes. When paired with mindful eating and regular activity, consistent use may support long-term metabolic wellness.

He has not fixed the mirror or even so much apologized for what he did.  Today he sent me a series of nasty texts sayin we are broken up and not getting back together.

It's somewhat fascinating, the way they juggle complex tasks with little recognition. When everything's working fine, we barely notice them, but when the system's down, they become our superheroes.

Right then, watching Joe slip out of the office at the end of the day, a question popped into my head, which I thought to bring over here.

1pp2wq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1pp2wq5/the_last_supper/,The last supper,"On Christmas Eve, few people talk about it. It’s like a superstition no one wants to admit they know, yet everyone somehow fears.
Some call it an urban legend, others say it’s just a story meant to scare lonely people. But those who have lived it… well, those who have lived it usually don’t want to talk about it. And those who haven’t probably will one day. Just being alone on the 24th is enough.
That’s why Isabel tried to pretend she wasn’t really alone that Christmas.
Her parents had passed away a few years ago, her sister lived in another country, and the few friends she had had their own families. She swore she didn’t care…
She swore to herself, to her coworkers, and to her friends that all she wanted for the holiday was peace, quiet, and a good wine. She swore so many times that she began to believe it… until the morning of the 24th.
At breakfast, while stirring sugar into her cup, she saw on the restaurant’s TV a report about strange Christmas traditions around the world. Among them, one sentence stood out:
— “And in a small town north of Portugal, there is the legend of the Lonely Supper, a ghostly table that appears in the home of anyone spending Christmas alone…”
Isabel immediately looked away. It was a coincidence. People loved that kind of story.
But the image that appeared on TV—a perfectly set table with black and red candles, porcelain plates, and silver cutlery—made her stomach turn.
She had heard it before…
Once, when she was sixteen, her grandmother had told the story as a warning.
“If you are alone on Christmas Eve and a supper appears in your home, sit down, even if the food is cold, even if you feel afraid, sit… What enters through the door if you don’t sit is not of this world…”
She had laughed at her back then… Called it nonsense…
But years later, when her grandmother passed away, the warning screamed in her memory, louder than ever…
And now, that morning, that feeling returned…
— What nonsense — Isabel murmured as she finished her coffee and paid the bill.
After that, she decided to spend the whole day busy: cleaning the house, reorganizing the shelves, watching somewhat bad movies, and opening the wine early.
All of this was to avoid the silence… the kind of silence that leaves room for imagination…
When the clock struck 11:40 PM, Isabel sat on the couch, trying to ignore that unease.
It was as if the house itself were holding its breath, in suspense, waiting for something…
“It’s just a story,” she thought.
She repeated it. And repeated. And repeated… she couldn’t stop telling herself it was just a story…
Then, at 11:59 PM, the lights flickered.
Once…
Twice…
Three times…
The house plunged for a brief moment into complete darkness…
Isabel stood up instantly, her heart racing…
She knew every inch of that apartment and knew she hadn’t left anything on the living room table. Not even a tablecloth…
But when the power came back, the scene had changed…
And believe me, it had completely changed…
The table was there…
Isabel swallowed hard. It had to be a prank, an intrusion, something logical… but the more she looked, the less rational it seemed…
The table, once empty, was now covered with a cloth embroidered with golden threads that reflected the candlelight… Four places were set, each with fine porcelain plates and shiny silver cutlery…
In the center, a platter of steaming roast turkey, alongside candied fruits, king cake, cheeses, a pitcher of wine, and even a small silver bell… undoubtedly a table set just like many Christmas Eve tables…
But what truly chilled her spine were the cards placed before each plate…
The first read: 
“Helena Duarte 1954–2012.”
Her mother.
The second: 
“Rogério Duarte 1951–2018.”
Her father.
The third: 
“Marcos Vieira 1986–2024.”
She recognized the name of a coworker who had been hospitalized for weeks, with no expected recovery…
And the fourth card…
The fourth card was facedown, and Isabel didn’t need to pick it up… She knew… she felt a shiver run through her bones…
The entire table seemed to vibrate slightly, as if waiting for something… or someone…
Her grandmother had always said:
“Sit before something comes to sit in your place.”
But what if sitting was worse? What if accepting to sit was some kind of invitation to… to… oh my God…
She stood frozen, trying to decide what to do…
Then she heard the first sound.
Tap… tap… tap…
Footsteps in the building corridor…
Slow footsteps…
Heavy footsteps…
And they were getting closer…
Panic twisted Isabel’s stomach… she ran to the door and checked if it was locked…
It was… twice… But the footsteps continued…
Tap… tap… tap…
And then someone or something tried to turn the doorknob…
No knock, no calling…
Just trying to enter…
The table behind her seemed to sigh, as if tired of waiting…
The candles flickered even though there was no wind…
And the bell… the small bell in the center of the table jingled by itself…
That was enough to break Isabel’s mental block…
She ran to the chair where the facedown card lay and sat down immediately… trembling, breathless…
The exact moment her body touched the chair, whoever was trying to open the door stopped…
The silence that followed was so deep it felt strange and supernatural…
The candles burned brighter, as if approving her decision.
Isabel tried to control her breathing as her eyes, almost involuntarily, stared at the card before her… With her hand shaking, she flipped it over…
“Isabel Duarte 1987–??”
She almost fell off the chair…
— No… no, no, no…
The birth date was correct, but the question marks in place of the death year seemed to float menacingly over the paper…
She felt the house change…
The wood creaked… the windows vibrated…
The table seemed to breathe slowly but deeply…
— What do you want? — she whispered, not knowing exactly who she was talking to…
Then she heard a chair move by itself…
Another chair…
And another…
The remaining three chairs slid a few centimeters, as if someone had sat in each of them — invisible presences were taking their places at the table…
The air grew cold… the candle on the right went out… then the left…
In front of Isabel, it became dark, illuminated only by the central candle… She felt she was no longer alone…

Insurance? HA.” I got all red and embarrassed and said “no I don’t work I live off my Va disability and my late spouses and take care of our son.” And he started to lecture me on not being honest and how does one just not work etc etc and how lucky it must be to just exist and travel without financial stress…I think the worst part of the date was when he asked how my husband died and I made a joke about how I guess not doing the dishes right away can make a guy snap I guess.

This was the first stop on the second annual Chesapeake Coffee Run!

I happened to see they were having a grand opening so the timing was perfect!

There's pretty cozy, family vibes they've got going on! I'd say the prices are average and the space is medium sized. There's free street parking and it's right down the street from ForKids.

I got a hot café con leche and added caramel and white chocolate (my favorite flavor combination) and it was great! I finished the whole thing while I was still in the store.

The owners were super welcoming and you can tell this is a family business (I appreciate seeing the youths at work helping their parents!).

They offer coffee and pastries and also sell different coffee blends as well as some local goodies. The plushie coffee cups were super cute!

In addition to the main register where you order and the main lobby, they have a restroom, a little children's room, and an additional space to chill that's separate from the main lobby.

Right before entering we got to meet Mrs. Johnson (with the gorgeous red jacket), Mr. Whittaker (with the cool hat), and Mayor West (with the nice scarf)!

It was a blessed day and I pray Rich Port Coffee becomes a shining light here at The PEAKe of Excellence!!

Stay tuned for my next stop on the 2025 Chesapeake Coffee Run!

I am a 34F INFJ from Cape Town, South Africa. I am 170 cm tall, with naturally curly black hair that I wear straight in the colder seasons. I am curvy fit and love working out - especially weightlifting, running and pilates. I grew up in a Christian home, but consider myself more spiritual than religious. I appreciate and respect all religions and am open to getting to know the person you are, without judgment. South Africa is a multicultural country with diverse cultures, faiths, and 12 official languages. I studied the Sciences and Engineering, and spent most of my time focusing on my studies and work.

Things I love to do: 

* I enjoy reading (mostly self-help books), but have been challenged to read more fiction, so I have many books on my current TBR list. I am currently rereading my favourite annual book (The Four Agreements), ""When the Body Says No"" by Gabor Maté, and ""I who have never known men"" by Jacqueline Harpman. 
* I love classical music and am a huge fan of Erik Satie, Vivaldi and Debussy. 
* I also enjoy listening to a wide range of piano pieces, especially when solving mathematical equations or building educational robots as part of my job. 
* A huge fan of Hans Zimmer, Max Richter, and Ludovico Einaudi. 
* EDM is a favourite of mine when I am working out. It adds to the happiness of released endorphins :). Fun fact: I love to dance, but I only do it for my dogs right now (introvert things). 
* I like to meditate and have been using the Insight Timer app for a few years now. I started meditating after attending an Introductory Meditation course at the Practical School of Philosophy in Cape Town. I really want to participate in a 10-day silent meditation course (Vipassana) in the new year. 
* I paint in my free time and enjoy going on solo dates. I like visiting museums and new coffee shops. My upcoming solo date plans are to go to the Planetarium for a day tour, and the South African Astronomical Observatory for a night tour and stargazing :)
* I used to enjoy sending snail mail and want to pick it up again in the new year. 
* I love writing poetry and would like to publish my own book one day :)
* Sharing the Action For Happiness Calendars :)

I haven't watched Star Wars, and I am planning on watching some of the movies over my two-week vacation. If you are a Star Wars nerd, then that is a plus. I would like to hear your take on the films. 

There is so much more I want to say, but I will leave that for our conversations. I appreciate kindness, integrity and mutual respect. If you've made it this far and would like to chat, feel free to send me a message.

1pp2p31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pp2p31/gaming_and_solar_system/,Gaming and solar system,"Hello,

I've been living in a forest with a solar system for a few years now, and I've been using an OLED Switch for a few years.



I bought it because I thought it was more or less the only viable option; I didn't know about the Steam Deck.



Fifteen years ago, I played Counter-Strike and the like on PC, then I switched to consoles, preferring Xbox (I love the Xbox One controllers, they fit me perfectly). Now, I mostly play small and medium-sized indie games on the Switch, but I'm starting to look at more demanding RPGs.

I should mention that I don't care about exclusives—especially Nintendo ones—and I'd rather skip a game and have a console that suits my needs. So, I was starting to look at newer handheld consoles, but going back to something that gives me access to Steam could be really cool given how I use it. It appeals to me both in terms of the game library and the price. But three options emerged:



\- The Switch 2: Meh, not thrilled by Nintendo.

\- The ROG Aly X: Ouch, the price!? No OLED at that price?



\- The Steam Deck: A bit outdated?



I'm not opposed to tweaking graphics settings, but it's always better to be able to do without it, I imagine.



Actually, I'm not looking for much portability, as I mainly play on my sofa. At best, there's a coffee table in front of me to put a potential monitor or laptop.



So there are several other options:

\- A gaming laptop: How much would a laptop cost that can run demanding games without maxing out the settings, but still be enjoyable? And I imagine I'd need to add a monitor... I'd like to play with an Xbox controller.



\- A desktop gaming PC: I imagine that would cost less than a laptop? But the problem is that it seems to use quite a bit of electricity!



\- An Xbox Series X, a PS5, or the upcoming Steam console? They also seem to use a fair amount (maybe less than a desktop gaming PC?), but you'd have to move the monitor around the table for every game.



I only have 800W of solar panels. In the dry season, it wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in the rainy season, it's nice to be able to play on the console without worrying about the power going out.



One last thing: I live in an open-sided wooden house, which gets a bit damp depending on the season. My Switch is holding up surprisingly well (except for the rubber on the analog sticks, but I'm still on my first controller in three years). So, I imagine that putting 1000 bucks into this project would really be the absolute maximum, and if I do it, it'll be carefully considered to get something that meets my expectations. I'm not in a rush for this project, but I'm starting to see a lot of games that appeal to me. Like when I took a 5-year break from gaming, it's okay, you can catch up with all the games you'd previously set aside for yourself!



Thanks so much in advance for your advice and feedback :)",1,1765992963.0,pcmasterrace,4,0.67,False

1pp2olh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1pp2olh/ive_been_trapped_in_the_sunshine_eternal/,I've been trapped in the Sunshine Eternal waterslide for weeks,"I’m never going to be able to forget that sunny day. Typical summer heat, bright sunshine burning your skin. I always liked the summer, but this year was different.

My girlfriend Katie and I had broken up three weeks before this all happened. We had been together for four years. Four happy years—at least I thought so. Katie was a hard worker, had a good job as a marketing manager for a car company, while I was a dead-broke burger flipper. We met in spring on a Niagara Falls ferry ride. Me with my friends, her with her family. Getting off the ride, she had dropped her wallet. In the one instance I decided not to be a scumbag and return the wallet, I found the love of my life.

I was stupid then. No goals or achievements. No wonder Katie had dumped me. I didn’t leave the house much after that.

My friend Trevor wasn’t a bright man, but he always knew how to make me smile. He was tall, handsome, and always wore the same untied, beat-up Converse. I didn’t expect him to understand how much it hurt losing Katie—Trevor never had a problem getting girls. It killed me seeing how many of them he brought back to our dorm while I sat on my side of the room sulking.

“Come on, man, it’ll be fun!” he said, smiling as always.

“Trevor, man, I told you that I don’t want to go. It’ll probably be super busy anyways.”

“Dude, you aren’t going to get anywhere sulking, and class doesn’t pick back up for a few more weeks. We are going.”

“Isnt your girlfriend coming over today?”

“Dude that chick and I split days ago,” He scoffed. “Besides, I want to go drink some beers by the pool with my best bud. There will be lots of nice looking ladies there, and i’ll be nice enough to save you a couple.”

I laughed, for the first time in weeks.

Trevor usually won arguments, so begrudgingly, I went with him.

We arrived at noon, just Trevor and me. Like I had predicted, the park was packed. Snotty-nosed kids with ice cream smeared on their shiny lips, old men with love handles pouring over their swimsuits, and pools filled with pee. Great.

I was excited, however, to try the new slide: The Sunshine Eternal. The slide was massive, spanning nearly the entire park, wrapping around it like a snake. Different turns and twirling corners—if this slide couldn’t get me in a better mood, nothing would, not even Trevor’s stupid jokes.

We ran right for the lineup, Trevor making sure to puff out his chest as we walked by girls. The line was surprisingly small, with only a few people ahead of us.

As we made our way to the mouth of the slide, something seemed off. While most covered slides had some sort of lighting, this had none. Just a large black maw that stared back at me menacingly.

“Uh, Trevor, man, why don’t you go first?”

“Ha, Dude; tell me you’re not gonna pussy out of this one too.”

He could see the unease on my face.

“N-no, man, I’ll be right behind you.”

The lifeguard waved a half-hearted gesture to go forward. I could tell hours of listening to chubby kids screaming was getting to him. His face was that of an angry grown man making minimum wage. I couldn't blame him, he is a braver man than I. I'd stay jobless forever if that was my only option.

“See you on the other side,” Trevor said as he propelled himself down the long, winding tube, making sure to scream like an idiot the whole way down.

After a few seconds, it was my turn. The lifeguard glared at me with impatience. Though I felt nervous, I brushed it off and prepared to launch myself down. 

The water was cold to the touch. I was totally considering pussying out, but Trevor's yelps of childlike thrill made me inch myself toward the beginning. That, and the lifeguards glaring stare.

As I made my way down the beginning, I heard something strange.

Nothing.

There was no sound. No dipshit kids squealing, no middle-aged father laughing obnoxiously, no splashing water from pee-filled pools. Nothing. Just quiet rushing water from the slide. It was peaceful.

It took a few seconds, but suddenly there were lights. Bright neon—the way it twisted and spiraled with the direction of the tube was pleasant to look at. Colors whipped by me in a flash. My entire body is thrashed with every corner. A faint smile cracked on my face. The slide lived up to my expectations. Wild turns and sharp declines thrilled my senses.

I was glad to have come, even though I’m sure Trevor had already made it out and was chatting up some looker on the other side of the park. For a moment I had forgot about my shitty life; it was just me and the slide.

Minutes went by as I wore a big, toothy smile. Then several more minutes passed, and the smile faded. Around five minutes had passed, and so had the novelty. Eight minutes—surely it had to end soon. Bright colored plastic and strobing lights could only entertain an adult for so long.

But it didn’t end.

Minutes turned into what seemed like hours, and joy turned into panic. What was happening? Am I stuck in a part of the slide? I had seen news reports of children not having enough momentum and getting stuck in water slides for hours. I banged on the plastic walls until my hands throbbed and my arms ached. I kicked and thrashed to stop myself, but the water was too overwhelming.

I repeated this for what I believe to be several hours.

Nothing.

No end to the dancing lights. No one trying to help me. Just endless propulsion through a festive casket.

It has now been what I estimate to be three weeks in the tube. Obviously I have no sense of time, but after a while there was nothing to do but count. Count seconds, then minutes, then hours, then days. There has been no sign of human life, or anything besides the rushing water and the lights. At some point I noticed familiar parts of the tunnel. From what I can tell, it seems to be looping, resetting every day. Not just the slide, but my body too.

When I wake up, my skin is normal, but closer to noon it begins to get incredibly wrinkled from the water. By the end of the day, I have wrinkles as deep as twisting caverns, so much so that my skin becomes numb. White and frail, seeming so loose that it was malleable. The same goes for hunger, thirst, and any other basic human need. It gets really bad toward the end of the day,then in the blink of an eye it’s gone.

Due to this, sleep isn’t needed, but during a particularly long straight section of the tube, I try. At first it was impossible due to the rushing water, but nothing but miles and miles of tube has made my brain devoid of much thought.

I wonder if the tube will come to an end. What will be there waiting for me? Do I want to find out? I wonder if time is moving and I’ve just vanished. Is Trevor looking for me? Does Katie miss me?

Katie.

I regret how I treated her. I regret neglecting my duties. If only I had tried harder, she would still be mine, and I wouldn’t be here in this tube. I know that things could be different if I had the chance. I'd get a job, I'd use this schooling to find something well paying. We would buy a house somewhere in the forest. Tall oak would brim all sides of our property. Little footsteps would patter around the house. We’d get married, and sit outside to feel the cool breeze every night. She would be drinking her famous coffee. Two sugars, milk, honey, and cinnamon. I always thought it was gross sounding and refused to try, but every now and then I'd get a whiff and secretly wish I didn't have as much pride as I did, otherwise I'd tell her she was right all along and drink the whole thing. I should have told her a lot of things. I know I'm rambling, but what else am I supposed to do here? I'm now adjusted to the awful peeling sensation I get from my wrinkled skin, so there isn't much left to think about here. Last week, I sang every song I could think of to see how much of the lyrics I could remember. This week, I ran out of songs. Day dreaming and fantasy is all I have left.

I’ve tried to kill myself here. I’ve tried putting my head under water and keeping it there, but every time I do, the tube whips around in a new direction—almost like whatever has me here won’t let me go. 

Week 4

Something new happened today.

When I got to the part of the tube with the bright LED lights and the sharpest incline, the water stopped. I looked in both directions and realized I was stuck—sharp decline behind me, sharp incline ahead of me. This was odd, as nothing has happened in four whole weeks. Nothing but endless thick plastic.

I wondered if the incline could be high enough to kill me if I were to climb to the top and fall headfirst. I didn’t want to die, but this isn’t much of a life. Death is better than this.

Or maybe this is death.

Am I trapped in some sort of purgatory? Not heaven, not hell, not Earth—just trapped.

This can’t be real.

I began to climb.

It was an awkward position. The tube shoots upward almost impossibly straight. My legs, now dry enough to get a good grip on the plastic, hurt with every movement. My loud stomps and bangs echoed through the tube, and I realized how quiet it was. All I’ve heard for weeks is rushing water.

Maybe this is some sick game being played on me, or a challenge for me to prove myself and move on to heaven.

I can almost see the top now. I recognize where I am—roughly ten hours into the tube loop.

As I make my way upward, suddenly there’s a loud thud coming from the bottom of the slide. The sound is so loud I nearly lose my footing. I look down, but all I see are more stupid LEDs.

Maybe it’s my head. Maybe I’ve been here so long I’m making up sounds. Maybe my brain can’t handle the silence.

Another loud thud crashes into the side of the plastic tube, this time louder, closer.

“Hello?”

No answer.

“Is someone here to get me the fuck out of here?”

Nothing.

THUD

This time the sound is so close that whatever it is is only inches away from being visible. The impact vibrates the plastic walls, and I lose my grip.

Suddenly, I don’t want to die. Suddenly, I want to live—far away from whatever is making that noise. I want to see Trevor’s goofy smile again. I want to see Katie and tell her how much I hate her for leaving me on my own.

I throw my body in any direction I can. My hands regain their grip, but a searing pain erupts in my knee. As I fall, I slam it hard against the wall, peeling layers of skin off my kneecap like I’m a human potato.

White-hot pain shoots through my body. My skin is so weak from hours in the water that it wipes away like it wasn’t even attached, showcase bright pink flesh that had been hiding beneath it.

Though I regain my grip, I continue sliding downward. My exposed knee rubs against dry plastic, burning more with every second.

I’m within reach of the bottom of the tube.

One final labored thud echoes as a dark shadow appears near the opening. I can’t make out details—just a large figure dimly lit by strobing lights.

I scramble upward, fighting through the pain.

“Thud.” It’s right below me.

At the peak of the incline, I don’t dare look down. I know it has begun climbing.

Then the water starts again, pushing me onward. I hear whatever it is slide back down into the U-shaped bend.

It’s stuck.

My breath returns, and as the adrenaline fades, my knee throbs in agony.

If that thing is stuck, will I see it again when I loop around? It never occurred to me that in miles and miles of tube — something else could be sliding in here with me.

How long until it catches up?

Week 4, Day 3

When the loop reset, my knee was good as new, like nothing had ever happened. There was no sign of the monster when I reached the bend again.

As scary as it was, I’m glad I had something to think about. Four weeks in, I was beginning to go insane. I replayed every moment I could remember with Katie. I’d do anything not to think about her anymore.

I’ve been worried that maybe that thing could have been help, and my mind is so lost I couldn’t comprehend it.

This next part of the slide is my favorite. Fourteen hours in, the slide drops nearly straight down in complete darkness. It feels like a nightmarish sensory deprivation tank.

It’s awesome.

But I’m beginning to think I’m hopeless. There is no escape from this tube. I’m destined to be here forever. It’s only a matter of time until I reach whoever that was in the tunnel.

I’d like to think it was a lifeguard—my knight in shining armor—but I know the truth. Whatever it was, its intentions were filled with malice. Loud, thundering hate coated every bang and crash it made.

It’s too late for me.

I’ll never see the light of day again. I’ll never see Katie’s awkward smile or beautiful hair. I’ll never see my dirty dorm room, my teachers, my parents, my family dog—nothing.

Though masked by rushing water, I feel tears form in my eyes.

I am simply doomed.

Week 5

The water stopped again today, during my usual sleeping spot. This time there was no monster behind me—just a flat tunnel stretching for what looked like miles.

I crawled forward, my white, wrinkled fingers slowly regaining their color. I never realized how far this section went. Usually I’m asleep, carried through by rushing water.

Then I saw something glimmer.

Metal.

A door, sealed by a valve like something from an underwater hatch or an old-timey safe. The water surged back before I could reach it, slamming me face-first into the floor.

As I shot past, I saw it clearly.

An EXIT sign.

How stupid was I? The whole time there was a way out, and I was sleeping like an idiot. I was angry at myself, but thrilled. I couldn’t believe it.

I would need perfect timing. The pressure gets especially strong here due to how flat the tunnel is. I had the hours roughly down, but grabbing that valve would take precision.

A big, stupid smile stayed plastered on my face for hours.

Then I heard it.

Something echoed down the tube—far away, but clear. Laughter. Children. Women. Men. The worst part was that it wasn't sinister. It sounded of genuine joy.

Something else was in the tube with me. It hadn't just been in my head, but an actual entity was floating alongside me. Had we been lagging behind each other for weeks? 

It was far enough away that I believed I could beat it. As long as the water didn’t stop again, I could make it out. I could grab the door and free myself. 

Week 5, Day Two

It has been two days since I saw the exit. I think I’ve timed it perfectly now and was almost able to grab it today. Unfortunately, the water stopped again and threw my timing off.

The thing is still behind me. Because of the stoppage, it’s closer now. I can hear it faintly, swishing around every turn, almost like my own echo.

The laughing hasn’t stopped.

I hear it now.

Tomorrow, I will have to grab the exit.

I think of all the things I'll do when I’m out. All the wrongs I’ll right. All the things I'd say to Katie. Tell my parents I’m sorry for not speaking to them. Tell Trevor he’s an idiot. Just one more chance is all I need. 

Week 5, Day Three

The exit is minutes away.

No delay. My timing is perfect. We’ve just passed the part with the most spiraling twists. I say we because it hasn’t been delayed either. In fact, it sounds closer.

Hours and hours of laughing trail behind me, the creature lagging by only a minute or two. I wonder if this is the same creature I encountered days ago.

It was then I noticed something was wrong. The water pressure was different—not off, but slow. It crept down to nothing. This was bad. I’m so close to the exit, but the thing is so close to me. I start to crawl like a baby, eager to take its first steps.

The laughter got closer, and I realized that instead of this thing replicating voices, it emanated out around its body, as if ten people stacked themselves and went down the slide.

Im fumbling down over and over again. Desperately crawling, and taking pieces of skin off every time I hit the wall of the tube. It feels like falling through a cheese grater.

I saw the glimmer, and the water turned back on. Though its stoppage was brief, it was enough for the creature to catch up. I didn’t dare take the chance of losing my advance to look back. I didn’t want to know what was awaiting me.

Instead, I laid down and held my hands high in the air so as not to miss the exit this time. Even with the water returning, the creature kept advancing. The same arduous thumps were only feet away from me, drowned out by the sharpness of the giggles.

Here it is—my chance is now. The metal valve is closer. Closer. I wrap my hand around it, and suddenly, just as it had come, it went. My hands were too shaky to get a grip. The thing was breathing on my neck.

I get it now. This was my fate all along. Never to see Katie again. This was it. I missed my chance. I missed my chance with her. It’s too late for me to change what I had done. It was my fault that we didn’t work, and it was my fault that I’m trapped in this stupid fucking water slide. I was always the problem, weighing her down. I was a sickness keeping her from moving forward. Katie doesn't miss me, in fact, I bet since we split she’s never been better. And it wasn’t just Katie, but everyone. Trevor got stuck with a lazy, messy roommate. My parents got stuck with a son who never visits, and will never amount to anything. Maybe whatever lays behind me can put an end to me. Put an end to the existence I wasted when I was outside of this place.

I turned around to face the creature when suddenly I felt a hard thrash against my body. When I opened my eyes, I realized I was submerged under water. I couldn’t breathe, but I was alive. I saw a light radiating from above and swam toward it.

When I surfaced, there was nothing but white, shining light. When my eyes adjusted, I realized it was the sun. Ripples in the water hit my stomach, and as I lunged backward, I could make out a man in front of me.

“Dude, that was awesome,” Trevor laughs.

1pp2l41,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp2l41,Grandma Paranzino’s Baked Italian Rum Balls,"**Italian Chocolate Rum Balls**

This recipe comes from my Grandma Paranzino and has been part of our Christmas season for as long as I can remember. My sister and I grew up rolling these little chocolate rum balls at the kitchen table, long before our feet could even touch the floor. The original recipe was one of those old-school Italian cookies that leaned a little dry, so over the years, we gently tweaked it to give the cookie a softer bite while keeping every bit of the flavor we grew up with. Its been a holiday staple in our family for generations, and now I’m happy to share it with yours. 

**Ingredients**

**Dry ingredients**  
4 cups (450 g) sifted flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves  
1/2 teaspoon allspice  
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1 cup (200 g) sugar  
3/4 cup (75 g) baking cocoa

**Wet ingredients**  
1 cup (240 ml) Captain Morgan rum  
1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil  
1/2 ounce (15 ml) rum extract

**Optional mix-ins**  
1/2 cup (60 g) walnuts  
1/2 cup (80 g) raisins

**Chocolate rum glaze**  
4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter  
1/2 cup (50 g) baking cocoa, sifted

2 1/2 cups (275 g) sifted confectioners’ sugar  
2 ounces (60 ml) spiced rum  
1 teaspoon rum extract preferred, or you can use vanilla  


**Method**

If using raisins, they can be soaked in rum for 24 to 48 hours to soften and deepen their flavor. Drain well before adding them to the dough. The soaking rum can be reserved for future baking or used as a flavorful addition to coffee or ice cream.

If using walnuts, they should be toasted to enhance their flavor. For stovetop toasting, place them in a dry skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant. For oven toasting, spread them on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 5 to 7 minutes until lightly browned. Transfer to a clean plate or bowl to cool completely, then finely chop and set aside.

  
In a large bowl, sift the flour before measuring. This step is very important. Then measure the sifted flour into a separate mixing bowl, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for accuracy.  
Add the baking powder, baking soda, cocoa, sugar, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and black pepper to the flour and sift the mixture together. Whisk to fully combine.

  
If using walnuts and/or raisins, gently mix them into the dry ingredients. Adding them at this stage ensures they distribute evenly, because the dough becomes quite stiff once the wet ingredients are added. 

In a separate bowl, combine the rum, vegetable oil, and rum extract.  
Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Using your hands works well to fully incorporate everything. 

For a deeper flavor, the dough can be refrigerated overnight or for up to two days. Shape it into a disk and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. This step is optional, as the dough holds its shape well even without resting. When ready to roll, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to soften for at least 30 minutes.

  
Roll the dough into tight balls, about 1 to 1½ inches in size, roughly the size of a walnut. The dough will feel a little stiff as you roll it, and that’s normal.  
Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

  
Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 8 to 9 minutes. The cookies will go from a dark brown to a lighter brown and may crack slightly.

Do not overbake, as these cookies can dry out quickly.  
Let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack. 

**Make the Glaze** 

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.  
Once melted, gradually stir in the cocoa, adding a couple of tablespoons at a time while stirring constantly until smooth.  
When the cocoa is fully incorporated, remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the rum and rum extract (or vanilla).  
Add the confectioners’ sugar a little at a time until the glaze is smooth and glossy. The glaze should be thick but pourable, similar to warm chocolate icing.  
Keep a cup of room temperature water nearby and add 1/2 teaspoon at a time if a thinner consistency is needed.

Dip each cookie about halfway into the glaze and place them glaze side up on wax paper to set. The glaze will typically set within 30 minutes. 

**Storage**

Place the glazed, fully set cookies in an airtight container, using wax paper between layers. They can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.  
These cookies also freeze well and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.",1,1765992712.0,u_CookingwithDebs,0,1.0,False

Here's the brutal truth:

1. Marketing busywork is killing us (68% of rants): Endless content grinding, SEO tweaks that go nowhere, cold DMs that flop. One guy said he spent 25 hours/week 'replying to Reddit threads for leads' and got crickets. Relatable? I tried that last month – burned a full Saturday on r/SaaS comments, zero traction. Wtf.

2. Lead gen black hole (52% mentions): Everyone's chasing organic traffic but missing the 'hot' signals buried in noise. 'Scanned Twitter/Reddit daily but too slow' came up 20+ times. I'm right there – wake up to 50 notifications, half spam, and by the time I spot a real buyer? They're gone.

3. AI hype crash (41%): Tons excited about 'AI everything,' but half the stories end in 'tried it, wasted $200/month, back to manual.' Efficiency dreams turning into more overwhelm.

**The kicker**? 80% of these high-engagement posts are from folks admitting failure first. Success porn gets downvoted; raw 'I suck at this, help' blows up.

Anyone else trapped in this loop? What's your biggest time sink right now – and what's one hack that's actually saved you hours? Spill, solopreneur fam... before we all burn out.",1,1765992705.0,Solopreneur,0,1.0,False
1pp2kuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TirzepatideRX/comments/1pp2kuo/life_changing_so_far/,Life changing so far!,"I hope it's ok to jot down my thoughts on my early experience with the medicine so far. I'm about to start week 3 of 40 units of tirzepatide. My food noise has gone way down. I used to always think about food, always craving, always hungry, always always always never-ending eating. I'd eat a whole meal and be hungry in less than an hour, and then, of course, I saved room for dessert. And then maybe something salty afterwards. We spent $2k in ONE month on door dash! That was a huge wake up call!

The Changes: On my honeymoon, we ate clean and fresh food which helped reset my pallette from all the overly processed foods we were eating before. Realized I wanted to make changes in what I eat. Started the medicine at 20 units first week of December and saw a difference in my hunger the first few days but not a ton.

Since going up to 40 units, I'm not always hungry and I do still crave salty snacks around once a day but I don't feel like I'm about to waste away if I don't have them. I've lost 3 pounds so far. Very surprisingly, I found that the medicine is also good for PCOS, MCTD AND! And! it's had the added bonus of helping my mood somehow. I'm in better spirits and I'm better able to regulate my moods. I'm not always cringing in pain, but don't worry - I'm still gonna see a Rheumatologist and PCP. 

I've switched from Lays and nachos to pretzels and pumpkin seeds! Whenever I see most foods, my stomach automatically rejects it. I am craving salads and lean meats. I'm a lot more picky and can eat way less now. Also drinking less alcohol.

PSA: I did also switch to Nexplanon implant right before the honeymoon and I'm sure that's helped at least more than a little. 

Symptoms: I have certainly noticed nausea in the morning but it's helped with a small breakfast or coffee. Usually a couple sips and I feel right as rain! I'm definitely using the bathroom a lot more and it feels I'm getting rid of everything Ive eaten the day before. I'd use the restroom once in the morning and now it's about twice in the morning, once in the afternoon and once in the evening. I'm also noticing I'm way more thirsty. 

Next Steps: The next big change is to actually drink water. I've been perpetually dehydrated for at least two decades and I'm scared of what'll happen when I reach my full hydration potential. I've been one of those people who drank sodas, energy drinks, and lemonade for three years straight in college without a single sip of water. So needless to say, now that I'm closing in on 30, I'm working to treat myself and my body with love and care. I'm trying to find a way to sneak my brain to drink a lot of water. perhaps a can of Bubly mixed with water and a packet of Celsius? idk. Or trying to find an infuser bottle so I can have lemon and cucumber water. 

I think I do want to jump another 20 units depending on how this next week goes since I'm still noticing it takes a good bit more me to feel full, but that could just be because I'm due for an injection! It's still hard for me to make that change of not thinking of food and immediately going and getting it. I'm working hard on discipline, and it's been difficult. 

if anyone has any thoughts or ideas on water intake or food discipline, I'd really appreciate it. I found out my new insurance covers Noom starting Jan 1 but I still want to start now instead of waiting. ",1,1765992694.0,TirzepatideRX,4,1.0,False

1pp2fdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1pp2fdk/mr_silvergleid_is_not_available_for_appointments/,Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.,"In the heart of the city stands an abandoned bakery.

It is a high, sprawling complex of brick and granite, and its great smokestack still stands watch over the loading bays where fleets of gleaming trucks once began their journeys to supermarkets across New England.

Now the weeds grow long and tall across the parking lot, and the great ovens sit silent upon the darkened factory floor.  Only the former administrative wing shows signs of occasional life, having been refurbished as office space and rented out to small businesses whose clientele will not be intimidated by the great emptiness next door.

Tonight, as the clock strikes eleven, only one of these offices remains lit.   The rear window – heavily frosted, and recently installed – reveals only the vaguest of shadows to the outside world.  Behind it, a stout, graying, and exquisitely dressed gentleman hunches over a massive writing-desk that is entirely devoid of electronic devices.  The only adornment is a single faded photograph of a dark-haired lady, standing before a trellis that bursts with flowers.

The man’s muttonchop whiskers give him the appearance of a latter-day Ebenezer Scrooge, and the fabric of his suit appears both expensive and somehow oddly-cut.  His brow furrows in concentration as his pen flies over sheet after sheet of thick, cream-hued paper, filling each with flowing script that seems to crackle with urgency.

The desk drawer at his left elbow stands open, and with his left hand he places each finished page into it even as his right drops the pen and reaches for a fresh sheet.

This is my boss, Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

I state this latter fact because doing so is a duty of my employment.  I have other duties: ensuring a fresh pot of coffee on the burner, keeping the stocks of paper and pens filled to Mr. Silvergleid’s specifications, occasionally patrolling the immediate perimeter of the office to ensure that ""all is in order"" (whatever that may mean) – but the core of my mandate is quite clear.

Do not make any appointments for Mr. Silvergleid.

""That’s right, kid,"" he’d told me at the interview, as I blinked and tried to decide whether to chuckle.  ""Ten to two, every weeknight.  And you don’t let anyone past you, and you *don’t* make any appointments.  Not any.  Can you do that?""

I’d thought about it as the sun sank low over the crumbling houses across the street.  ""What if someone needs to talk to you?"" I asked at last.

Mr. Silvergleid smiled, and it did not reach his eyes.  ""They don’t.  You know anyone who’s just gotta jaw with a guy like me in the middle of the night?  Nah, kid, they might say they do.  But they don’t.  All you gotta do is send ‘em away so I can focus on my work.  And how are you gonna do that?  Say it for me, kid.""

I cleared my throat.  ""Um, Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Mr. Silvergleid clapped me on the shoulder, and his smile seemed more genuine now.  ""You’ll do fine, kid.  Welcome aboard.""

Now, tonight, I sit at my desk in the outer office and consider whether I truly need another cup of coffee.  On my desk sits a half-finished project for one of my architectural classes – if nothing else, the job affords me ample leisure to focus on my schoolwork.  Behind me, the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office is shut as always.  Warm golden light spills through the frosted window, and beyond I see only the vague shadow of my employer bent over his desk.

The door to the outside swings open.

This is both unexpected and largely unprecedented.  I have by now been in Mr. Silvergleid’s employment for almost three weeks, and our association has settled into a predictable routine.  I arrive shortly before ten, put on a pot of coffee, and greet Mr. Silvergleid as he bustles in and closes his office door gently behind him.  Four hours later, he emerges and hands me a crisp stack of bills as he bids me good night.

In the interim, I am free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiry suggest themselves, so long as the coffee remains hot and the stationary stacked high.

Our cozy arrangement has been interrupted only twice – once by a gentleman in a sleeveless shirt who wishes to ascertain whether this is Nasty Boy’s joint, and a second time by a dark-haired beauty whom I recognize immediately from the photograph on Mr. Silvergleid’s desk.  She offers a cheery wave and deposits on my desk a large plate covered in foil.

""Nathan, isn’t it?  So nice to meet you.  I just swung by to drop this off.  To welcome you to the firm, so to speak.""  She dimples when she smiles.

I smile back; it is good to see a friendly face, and to meet the elusive Mrs. Silvergleid in person.  She has changed little from her photo, and while younger than her husband, exudes something of the same Victorian spirit.  I carefully peel back the foil to reveal a bountiful pile of home-baked muffins dotted with chocolate chips and strawberries.

""From our house to yours,"" says Mrs. Silvergleid.  ""No, no, don’t get up.  I know how he gets about interruptions.  I just wanted to say welcome aboard.  And…"" she trails off.

""Ma’am?"" I say at last.

""And just be careful,"" she says.  ""Be *strict*.  If you ever need to talk…"" she shrugs.  ""I’ll stop by once in a while.  I know you’ll do great.""  And she is gone into the night.

I am still thinking about her words when I realize I have finished the muffins and am hungry for more.  The perils of the night shift, I suppose.

Other than these brief interludes, we have entertained no visitors.  As Mr. Silvergleid himself said, why would we?

Tonight, though, the door opens.  And a man comes in from the dark.

\_\_\_

He is tall, thin, gangly – so tall, in fact, that he has to bend his head slightly as he passes through the doorframe.  He is clad in an olive-drab greatcoat and a battered brown hat, which he removes politely as he enters.  His face somehow brings to mind both a scheming Roman senator and a plow-horse well past its prime.

He smiles at me with his mouth.  ""Mr. Silvergleid?"" he says, pointing toward the inner office, and makes as if to step past me.

I am still trying to adjust to this sudden break in my routine, but I do have the presence of mind to hold up a finger.  ""Um, your name, sir?""

He stops, shakes his head as if in self-admonition.  ""Of course.  I am deacon Keyhole.  I serve at Mr. Silvergleid’s church in a pastoral, or perhaps an administrative, capacity.  There is, I regret to say, a problem with the lights.  If I may?""  He gestures to the inner office.

To say that these remarks throw me off-balance would be putting it mildly.  Deacon Keyhole’s watery blue eyes are fixed on mine, and they belie his friendly smile.  I look away, busy myself with the papers on my desk.

""I am very sorry, sir,"" I say to one of them.  ""Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Deacon Keyhole does not answer.  And when the silence stretches too long and I look up, the office is empty.

I am seized with alarm.  The outer door remains closed; deacon Keyhole must have taken advantage of my preoccupation to sneak past me into Mr. Silvergleid’s office.  My employer will doubtless be displeased, and I will lose a job which has provided me with both quiet study time and a growing bank balance.

I lurch from my chair and rip open the inner door to Mr. Silvergleid’s sanctum, a hasty apology already forming on my lips.

Mr. Silvergleid is at his desk, writing, undisturbed.  He looks up with mild concern.  ""Everything all right, kid?""

I blink, staring at each corner of the room in turn.  ""I – uh – deacon Keyhole – ""

Mr. Silvergleid relaxes and nods, as if in perfect understanding.  ""You did great, kid.  It’s like I said.  No one needs to be in here.""

I look back into the outer office, expecting to surprise deacon Keyhole hiding behind a flowerpot or a filing-cabinet.  ""But he’s still – where’d he go?""  And I tell Mr. Silvergleid, albeit with much stammering and head-scratching, about the visitor.

Mr. Silvergleid looks me straight in the eye, man to man.  ""He’s gone, kid.  You don’t need to worry about him; he won’t be back.""  He sighs and picks up his pen.  ""Just be ready for the next one.""

I pause with my hand on the door-handle.  ""Did – does he really go to your church?""

""That guy and church don’t mix,"" says Mr. Silvergleid.  ""Keep up the good work, kid.""  And he bends over his writing-paper.

\_\_\_

I am left with several questions.

I do not, for the time being, trouble Mr. Silvergleid with them when he emerges from his office and hands me my nightly packet.  For instance, I do not ask why he employs me to turn away visitors instead of simply locking the door to keep them out.  Perhaps I do not truly want to know the answer.

And I am, of course, back at my station the following night.

I do not pretend to understand all the dynamics at play, but I do not need to.  My part is simple: make coffee, refuse appointments.  At the rates Mr. Silvergleid is paying, I can do this with pleasure.

Nothing happens that night, or the next.  I do take Mr. Silvergleid’s admonition to patrol the perimeter somewhat more seriously, and at least once an hour I step forth into the dark and pace the cracked sidewalk in front of the office.

But the tranquillity of the night is unbroken.  There is no sound but my footsteps and the wind through the tall grasses.

On Friday, Mr. Silvergleid calls me into his office.  He takes a sheaf of finished papers from his desk drawer and begins to place them into a large manila envelope.  ""Something a bit different tonight, kid,"" he says, then curses as one of the sheets goes astray and flutters to the desk in front of me.

I pick it up and hold it out to him, making an active effort to avoid reading what is written upon it; to do so would seem a violation of Mr. Silvergleid’s privacy, at a minimum.  However, my eye cannot help but catch a fragment or two as he thanks me and returns it to the stack:

*…Legionnaire’s Daughter and the Duchess are especially dangerous –*

*…guardian can ultimately can be neutralized only by –*

*…used to open directly to the Orangery, but on my most recent visit –*

Mr. Silvergleid seals the envelope and slides it across the desk to me.  ""You’re gonna take this to a guy named Saul.  Good guy, friend of mine.  Don’t give it to anyone else.  Here’s the address.""  He scribbles a few lines on an index card.  ""You shouldn’t be bothered. But if you are, meet me here.""  He scribbles on another card and passes it to me along with my night’s salary.  The stack of bills seems slightly thicker than usual.

""You can head home when it’s done.  See you Monday – and keep those cards.  We do this every week from here on out.""

I stand and put the cards in my wallet.  ""Yes, sir.  How will I know Saul?""

""He’s gonna ask you if you like steak.  You’re gonna say, only if it’s cooked right.""  He grabs his coat and hat from the coat-rack.  ""Don’t write that one down.  It’s gonna change every time.""

I think of asking why it will be necessary to use a passphrase once I know what Saul looks like.  Instead I nod and ask: ""Leaving early tonight, sir?""

He shrugs.  ""You’ll be gone.  Someone might come in.""

I follow him out into the night.  And though the breeze is warm, I feel a chill.

\_\_\_

The delivery goes without incident.  Saul, a quiet man with a firm handshake, meets me in an empty function room beneath a busy downtown hotel.  He asks after my health and slips the envelope into a secure briefcase, and within fifteen minutes I am safely home.

On Monday, the fire alarm goes off.

It is just before midnight – I have settled in with my schoolwork and a large coffee, iced in deference to the late spring heat.  Suddenly there are footsteps pounding down the stairs from the upper level, a sharp and jarring smell of smoke – and the wail of a klaxon piercing the air as a fully-clad firefighter emerges into the office.

He is a middle-aged man, red-faced and winded, with a long dark moustache and an air of brisk competence frayed by great pressure.  His eyes bulge when he sees me.  ""Buddy, you can’t – is there anyone else still in here?""  He clicks his shoulder radio, speaks into it: ""Control, suite 7 is *not* clear, I repeat, *not* clear.  I need additional hoses over here, *now*!""

His alarm is infectious.  I glance over at the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office, but it is as ever:  a vague shadow, bent over a desk.  I rise from my chair, and the firefighter is there: standing at my shoulder, urging me toward the door.  ""This place is going up, buddy,"" he shouts over the alarm.  ""Get out there and get across the street.  You ain’t got much time.  Sprinklers ain’t even working right.  Go, *go*!""

I gulp, look around the office.  ""My boss – ""

The firefighter glares at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, shakes his head.  ""You gotta be – he deaf or somethin’?""

Something tickles at the back of my mind.  ""I’ll get him,"" I shout.  ""You go on.  We’re right behind you.""

He shakes his head.  ""No time, buddy.  You got to go, *now*.  He in there?""  He points at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, steps away from me and toward the inner door.

But he does not open it.

I stand there in the smell of smoke, with the alarm-klaxon drilling into my brain, and I try to think.  I take a deep breath and look the firefighter straight in the eyes.  ""Mr. Silvergleid,"" I say,  ""is not available for appointments.""

The alarm stops.

The air is clear of smoke.

And a smile begins to spread across the firefighter’s face.  He places both of his rubber-gloved hands on my desk and leans in close.

""Do you want to see,"" he asks, ""what my eyes *really* look like?""

I do not.  And before I know it, I have stumbled away from him and out the front door.

In the parking lot, all is quiet.  There are no alarms, no smoke.  And no fire trucks, of course.  Why would there be?

My battered Dodge Charger awaits nearby.  I fumble in my pocket for the keys, still staggering backwards, expecting the firefighter to emerge any moment – to emerge and to show me his eyes.  But he does not – no one does.

And as my hand finds the keys – I realize: *Mr. Silvergleid is still in his office*.

With the firefighter.

I stop, breathing hard, and I force my body to walk back to the office.  The door hangs open.  I grip the frame hard with both hands and peer inside.

The outer office is empty.  And Mr. Silvergleid’s door is still shut.  Through the frosted window, his shadow writes on.

I collapse into my desk-chair and begin to shake.

I do not know how long I would have remained that way if left to myself, and in any case I am eventually roused by a soft voice at the door: ""Nathan?  *Nathan*!""

Mrs. Silvergleid enters, another foil-covered plate in her hands, and hastens over to my desk.  She sets the plate aside in a single practiced motion and takes my hands in hers.  ""Oh, no.  Poor Nathan.  Was it bad?""

I am still breathing hard, but her presence is calming.  I tell her, as best I can, about the firefighter.  ""I don’t – who *are* these people, ma’am?  And what do they want with your husband?""

Her eyes and voice are hard.  ""I don’t know.  Not exactly.  But I know that for two pins I’d march in there and tell him exactly what I think of him putting a young man like you in a position like this.  Better save it for breakfast, I suppose.""  She stands.  ""If you want to quit, Nathan, no one could ever blame you.  I’ll see to it that you get some money to send you on your way.  Just say the word.""

But I stand, and I meet her eyes.  ""No, ma’am.  Mr. Silvergleid’s been good to me, and it’s the right job.  I won’t let them chase me off.""

She presses her lips together.  ""Very well.  I think I’d better start coming by every night.  Just to check.""  She stops at the door and turns.  ""Be well, Nathan.  And remember – you don’t have to do this.""

""Yes, ma’am,"" I say.  But she is already gone.

\_\_\_

The next evening, there is a detour – a water main has burst, it seems, beneath one of the city’s busiest streets.  Traffic is routed several blocks to the west, and I decide to walk.  I park the Charger in front of a neon-lit Mexican restaurant, and a man steps out from beneath the awning.

""Nathan?"" he says.  ""Nathan T— ?""

I spin around.  The man is tall, thin, well-dressed.  He holds both hands up in a gesture of peace.  In one of them is a leather billfold with an ID inside.  He offers this to me with a smile.  ""I’m glad I caught you.  I was gonna come to your apartment, but this is better.  Name’s Phil.  I’m a private eye.""  I glance at the ID.  It is indeed a private investigator’s license, with Phil’s full name and photograph.  I nod, and it disappears into his pocket.  ""Let’s take a walk,"" he says.

I carry on toward the bakery, and Phil makes no objection.  ""I’ll be brief,"" he says.  ""I know you gotta work.  Let’s start with what we both know.""  He holds up a hand and starts ticking off fingers as he speaks.

""You’re a private secretary to a guy named Silvergleid.  Been in the job about a month.  Every night he writes, and last week he had you take what he’s written and deliver it to someone.""  He clears his throat.  ""Now this part we ain’t too sure about, but we think the contact is a Saul P–.  And we think you don’t know exactly what it is you been turning over to him.""

""Um, no comment,"" I say.  ""Do I need to call my lawyer or something?""

Phil chuckles.  ""I ain’t the police, son.  I got a boss, just like you.  Difference is, my boss didn’t tell me to do a bunch of stuff that’s gonna get me in trouble.""

I shake my head.  ""Trouble?  You mean Mr. Silvergleid’s in the Mafia or something?  I don’t buy it.""  I glare at Phil.  ""And he’s not available for appointments, either.""

Phil holds up both hands.  ""I ain’t asking for an appointment, son.  I know how he is about that.  And I know telling you to get me in there ain’t gonna buy me much.""  He sighs.  ""No, he ain’t Mafia.  We actually think this guy Saul is working for the Chinese Communist Party.  And that Silvergleid’s selling stuff to him.  Stuff that belongs to my employer.""

I shrugged.  ""So call the police.  Or the FBI.  Or – ""

Phil cuts me off.  ""You seen anything weird, son?  At Silvergleid’s, I mean.""

I press my lips together and walk faster.  The bakery is three blocks away.

""Sure you have.  I see it in your face.""  He matches my speed, his face hard and focused.  ""You ever wonder where Silvergleid works during the day?  Well, I’m not gonna name names, but you’d know the place.  A lot of the things they work on, a Communist spy would pay plenty for.  And one of them is a gas to give enemy soldiers violent hallucinations.  You feel me, son?""

And I do.  I do not want to, but I do.  Phil sees this in my face, too.  ""That’s right.  Just the thing to confuse the bad guys before we attack.  Or convince an innocent kid to trust a thief.""

He glances around.  ""We’re almost there now.  And I can’t be seen.  But I want you to take this.""  He shoves something into my pocket – a business card, I see briefly before it disappears.

""When you make your delivery on Friday, you call me.  I’ll have a team ready.  We’ll steam that envelope open, real careful, and we’ll copy what’s inside.  If I’m wrong, no harm no foul.  If I’m right, we’re gonna find out just exactly what the boys in Beijing have been paying Mr. Silvergleid for.""

He stops and holds up a finger.  We are close to the bakery now; it is clear he will come no further.  ""Why do you do it?  Two reasons, son.

""First, we’ll pay you for your trouble, but I don’t think that’s what matters to you.  What matters to you is doing the right thing.  Your boss tried to make you a patsy so he could sell military secrets to Communists.  You okay with that?  No, you aren’t.  So you’re gonna do the right thing.  Your boss goes away, my employers are happy, our soldiers are safe.""

He taps me on the chest.  ""Friday.  You hang onto that card.  You call me.""  He turns and is gone into the gathering dusk.

\_\_\_

Friday arrives, and I am not ready.

A powerful thunderstorm grips the city, and I awake with a pounding headache that dogs me throughout the afternoon.  Even migraine pills and strong black coffee only dull the discomfort.  I arrive at the bakery bleary-eyed and unsure of myself.

Mr. Silvergleid, for his part, seems troubled as well.  As he walks through the door, lightning cracks overhead, and he whirls with his silver-tipped cane gripped tightly in both hands.  The thunder rolls away, and he sighs and relaxes.  The smile he gives me as he makes his way to the inner office seems more forced than usual.

I pray, as I fumble with the coffee-pot, that Mrs. Silvergleid will appear, that I will find a way to confide in her and seek her advice without directly accusing her husband of being a traitor to the Republic.  But she does not, and soon enough Mr. Silvergleid’s door opens and he calls me in.

""Delivery day, kid,"" he says, stuffing papers into a new manila envelope and sealing it tight.  ""Just as well, really.  Looks like you’re not feeling it today, and I don’t blame you.  Go home after this and get some sleep.""  He hands me the envelope and my salary, but does not go to the rack for his hat and coat.  ""Saul’s gonna ask if you played baseball last week.  You’re gonna tell him yeah, but the game got rained out.  Good luck, kid.""

I nod, still unsure.  ""Yes, sir.  Are you coming?""  Despite my misgivings, the thought of him alone in the office fills me with disquiet.

He shakes his head.  ""Not just yet.  Something I gotta take care of first.""  He gives me the best grin he can, and I appreciate the effort.  ""Don’t worry about me, kid.  I been doing this a long time.  Someone shows up, I’ll send ‘em home myself.""

I smile back, and wonder if this can all truly be a cynical ploy by a thief who has subjected me to military-grade hallucinogens.  I wonder, and in response, I ask myself for the hundredth time: what is the alternative?

And I still do not know.

I drive halfway to the hotel, then pull the Charger over to the side of the road and park.  I put my head on the steering wheel, and I breathe.

Eventually, I take Phil’s business card out of my pocket and I call the number.

\_\_\_

Less than ten minutes later, a dark gray work van screeches to a stop in front of me.  On its side are emblazoned the name of a dry-cleaning company, and a picture of a cheerful rooster holding up a pair of bloomers.  The rear doors burst open, and Phil gestures furiously from within.  I emerge from the Charger, envelope in hand, and climb into the back of the van.  The doors slam shut behind me.

Three other operators are here as well, all sharply dressed, all bending over screens or other specialized equipment.  One pushes a metal cart carrying a small copier into position, and Phil takes the envelope from my hand and places it flat on the top.  He nods at me.  ""Thanks for calling, son.  I know it wasn’t easy.  But you’re doing the right thing.""

As he talks, he runs a small pen-like device over the seal of the envelope.  Steam issues forth, and in short order Phil is opening the flap and drawing out Mr. Silvergleid’s carefully-written sheets.  Phil rifles through them, whistles in satisfaction.   ""Oh, yeah.  This is the stuff all right, son.  You did real good.""

It is dim in the van, and Phil is moving the papers around as he speaks, but I try as best I can to catch a glimpse of what is written upon them.  If the pages are truly full of military secrets, I wish to see this with my own eyes, and thus convince myself that I have done right.  As before, though, I can see only fragments:

*…crystal-capped skyscraper just north of the former city center –*

*…there are always BEAUTIES in the LIGHTHOUSE –*

*…there are always SHADOWS in the CORNERS –*

*…underwater facility –*

*…former Imperial Skyway –*

*…sunken Mectunimoth –*

I can make no sense of it.  And, despite my best efforts, I am not comforted.

Phil perceives this, perhaps, for he claps me on the shoulder as his compatriot runs the sheets through the copier and returns them to the envelope.  ""It’s all right, son,"" he says.  ""It’s all right.  The hard part is over.  Here.""  He takes from his pocket a fat roll of bills, presses them into my hand.

""For your trouble.  That’s as much as Silvergleid would have paid you in six months.  And you can keep what he gave you.""  The other operator has finished re-sealing the envelope, and Phil takes it from him and returns it to me.  ""Hold up one second,"" he says, and makes a call on his smartphone.  ""Special Agent?  It’s Phil… we got it all.  I mean the *full* deck.  The boys are transmitting now… yeah.  Yeah.  I’ll ask him.  Okay.""

He looks at me.  ""Is Silvergleid still at his office?""

I gulp.  ""I think so.  He said he was staying… I don’t know how long though.""

Phil nods crisply.  ""Think you can keep him there for another thirty minutes?  The Special Agent is talking to the judge now.  As soon as he’s got the warrant in hand they’re moving in.""  He sighs and looks off into the distance.  ""I’m afraid your boss is going away for a long time, son.  This stuff…""  He shakes his head, looks at his watch.  ""It goes down at midnight.  If you can hold him there.  Tell him there was a problem with the pickup.  Tell him, uh – ""

I grip the envelope tighter and try to stand straight.  ""I’ll tell him Saul didn’t say the passphrase.""

Phil clasps my shoulder again.  ""Good.  That’s good, son.  Thank you – for everything.""  He opens the van doors.  ""Get going.  I’ll see you after.""

I run back to the Charger, start the engine, peel out into the street.  It’s ten minutes back to the bakery.  I flip a quick U-turn across the center line, ignore the outraged honking, watch from the corner of my eye as the gray van tears away from the curb.  The Charger’s engine roars as I accelerate through the sporadic late-night traffic.

I glance at the clock on the dashboard.  It’s 11:35.  If I can get to Mr. Silvergleid in time – if I can keep him there for midnight – for the appointment at midnight –

My stomach drops.  I slam on the brakes, coming to a complete stop in the middle of the still-busy thoroughfare.  A car whips around the Charger, roars past with the blast of a horn, and as I sit the full horror settles over me.

I realize, at long last and surely very belatedly, what I have done.

*I have made an appointment for Mr. Silvergleid.*

One that now takes place in less than twenty-three minutes.

My hands shake, and I will them to stop.  There is still time.  I can still fix this.

""I *must* fix this,"" I say out loud.  And I know it is true.

I put the hammer down, and the Charger leaps forward into the driving rain.

\_\_\_

I scrape and bounce into the bakery’s parking lot a bare five minutes later, screech to a halt just outside the office, and launch myself from the car.  As I scramble into the outer office I am already shouting: ""Mr. Silvergleid?  *Mr. Silvergleid!*  I’m so sorry – I made a mistake – you have to – ""

And I stop short, as Mrs. Silvergleid stares at me nonplussed from the visitor’s chair.  On my desk in front of her sits a plate of muffins.  She stands, her beautiful face creased with concern.  ""Nathan?  Whatever’s the matter?  You look like – ""

I wave my arms at her like a crazy person.  ""*I made an appointment!*""  I shout.  ""I didn’t mean – it doesn’t matter!  *We have to warn him!*""  I glance back at the outer door, expecting to see a SWAT team crashing through at any moment, but for now there is only the rain.

She breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth.  ""Okay.  It’s going to be okay, Nathan.  We’ll do it together.""  She glances at the inner door.  ""I’ll go first, all right?  He might take it better coming from me.""

This is my screw-up, and I should take the heat – but I am grateful for the support.  ""Okay,"" I say.  ""Thank you.""

""It’s my pleasure, Nathan,"" she says.  She turns, grasps the knob of the inner door, flings it open.  She strides through, and I am close behind.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" she shouts as she crosses the threshold.  ""*KEEPER OF* – oh!""

She stops, and I stop behind her.  For Mr. Silvergleid is not at his desk.

In his place sits the upper half of a department-store mannequin, clad in a fraying top-hat which superficially resembles Mr. Silvergleid’s.  The photo of Mrs. Silvergleid is gone from the desk, and in its place sits a single sheet of cream-colored paper covered in large block letters.

*YOU’RE BOTHERED*, it says.  The paper is turned so as to be easily readable by someone walking in the door as we just have.

Mrs. Silvergleid regards the scene, and she *hisses*.  She marches over and crumples the paper viciously in one hand –

And the room is filled with a sudden *BANG BANG BANG* as the rear door to the street, locked and bolted as it always is, judders in its frame against a series of brutal impacts.  With a final massive blow, the lock bursts from its moorings, and as the door swings open Phil charges through the gap.  His suit is immaculate as ever, and his eyes are blazing.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" he roars.  ""*KEEPER OF THE TUNNELS!  I OFFER THIS* – ""

He stops, stares, takes in the tableau.  His eyes fix on Mrs. Silvergleid, and in them I see only hate.  ""*You*!"" he spits.

Mrs. Silvergleid steps to the side, as if to keep both Phil and me in her field of vision, and her lip curls.  ""*You*,"" she says, and her voice drips with contempt.  Her resemblance to the kind woman who brought me muffins is growing slighter by the minute.  ""I should have *known*.  Did you really think – never mind.""  She shakes her head, smiles a poisonous smile.

""Here we stand,"" she tells Phil.  ""And here it begins.  We are *heard*.""  She raises her hand, points at the east wall.

A doorway has appeared where none was before: a battered wooden frame, yawning open to reveal a dark, cramped space filled with dusty crates.  It should not be there: behind that wall, I know, are the offices of the Vareigated Travel Agency, painted in bright appealing colors and festooned with pictures of sailboats.  What I look upon now is something else entirely.

""So we are,"" says Phil.  He drops into a fighting stance.  ""Let’s get you two acquainted.""

""Age before beauty,"" the former Mrs. Silvergleid replies.  Her hand darts into her coat pocket.

There is undoubtedly more, but I do not hear it.  I have, I think – at long last, and surely *very* belatedly – understood enough of the situation to plan and execute my next move.

It is, in brief, to step quietly back out of Mr. Silvergleid’s office and make my way to the front entrance.  As I pass through the door to the parking lot where the Charger awaits, the lights in the front office begin to flicker and dim.

I close the door behind me, and moments later I am roaring out of the parking lot.  In my hand is the second index card that Mr. Silvergleid gave me.

The one that tells me where to go when I’m bothered.

\_\_\_

Thirty minutes later, I am sitting at a secluded booth in one of the finest steakhouses in the city.  Across from me, Mr. Silvergleid sips from his wine-glass and then raises it in greeting as the maitre’d once again approaches us.

""Reginald,"" Mr. Silvergleid says.  ""Thanks again.  I’m sorry to put you to the trouble.""

Maitre’d Reginald bows and smiles slightly.  ""It is no trouble at all, Mr. Silvergleid.  Of course you must both stay with us tonight.  Charles is making up the West and South Rooms as we speak.  In the meantime, I do hope you enjoy your meal.""  He bows again and takes his leave.

Mr. Silvergleid squints at me.  ""You haven’t eaten much, kid.  You feeling all right?""  He sighs.  ""I mean, I know it’s been a day.  But you’re safe here.  And tomorrow you can go back home.  Really.""

I take a bite of steak to be polite.  It truly is excellent, and I am sorry I cannot enjoy it more.  ""I – um.""  I try to decide how best to formulate the question that has been weighing on me.  ""Am I fired, sir?""

For a moment, Mr. Silvergleid just goggles at me.  Then he throws his head back and laughs.  ""*Fired*?  Is that what’s eating you?""  He puts his glass aside and leans forward.

""You know the worst part of this gig, kid?  It’s trying to balance what I can tell people to keep them safe, and what’s gonna make them write me off as a nut.  Because if they write me off, they don’t take it serious, and someone gets hurt.""

He makes a brushing gesture.  ""You and me, we’re past all that.  You’ve seen behind the curtain, and you get it, and you *care*.  The job’s yours, kid.  To start with.  If you still want it.""

""I do, sir.""  I think for a moment.  ""Your wife was never really there, was she?""

He shakes his head.  ""My wife died fifteen years ago, kid.  I still miss her every day.""  He looks down for a moment, then brightens.  ""Listen, enough of that.  Tomorrow, we find a new office, and I tell you the score.  *All* of it.  And you decide how much you want to help.""

He beams and cuts into his steak.  ""Personally?  I’m guessing it’s gonna suit you right down to the ground.""

And do you know what, dear reader?  He is entirely right.

\_\_\_

This is, perhaps, a good time to wrap this tale up.  I am about to head out on a very special assignment for Mr. Silvergleid, and I do not yet know exactly when I will return.

In the meantime, I want to thank you for allowing me to get all of this off my chest.  It has been immensely helpful, and I want to close by recommending that you too find a trusted friend to whom you can unburden yourself.  Give that person a call, and set a time to meet and talk through whatever is ailing you.

Your call should not, however, be to Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

1pp2e7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesecarsuae/comments/1pp2e7v/geeley_vs_byd_vs_chery_vs_haval/,Geeley vs BYD vs Chery vs Haval,"Owner of a Chery tiggo 9 and 7, and I don't mind telling you it's been a regret. 

The AWRostamani tag they carry is just for the sake of it, the decency and quality assurance hasn't been passed down to the Chinese lineage.

They only have one showroom in Dubai where they all think they know about cars, but know very little of what they are selling. The sales staff themselves are discovering the brand and the car with each sale. The problem you always face with sales of car showrooms is that they are not automobile engineers you're talking to, but mostly people with great interpersonal skills. Geeley had a lady assigned to us who sold cosmetics in Russia or Ukraine before moving to Dubai, and thankfully it was our fourth test drive with the Monjaro so we weren't relying on her for knowledge, but that is reflection less on the sales staff more on the management or talent acquisition team. 

The Chinese are not the issue, the dealership in UAE is. The Chinese have the money, they are workaholics and are very aggressive in aiming to beat the USA and EU in terms of technology, build and engineering. Regardless of what the world says, eventually even Apple won't be anywhere without China since all phones are made there. It's the dealership in UAE which is the make or break factor for what your experience with the car is all the way from purchase until trade in or resale. 



Geeley and BYD transmission is smoother than Chery.

The one who designed BYD's interiors and design isn't probably their best recruit, therefore the Song plus.  Funny colors, strange seat covers, silly rotating central infotainment screen, and the man decided to stick the spare tire in the trunk which closes the conversation. What is nice is the pickup speed, driving experience and possibly the strongest AC. The Salesforce of BYD is busy misleading customers that if you don't have a wall charger at home don't worry, you can charge the car once a week and the rest the car will charge itself using petrol, you can drive it as a normal petrol car. So therefore BYD is a wrap.

BYD is good for housewives who live in villas or buildings with charging facilities and use the car for school drop offs and can keep the groceries scattered between the trunk and backseat. BYD isn't a man's car. 

If it's the electric chinese vehicle you're aiming at, Geeley's EX5 is your underdog, its a strong beauty in its own right. 

Geeley - Monjaro visually is nothing short of a Gucci Bag, the interiors look and feel expensive, and the center console is weirdly designed to ensure you spill all your coffee over the mode changing knob. Also removal of automatic parking from 2026 models was a complete turnoff. The infotainment screen is a small widescreen (I would prefer a 12-13 inch) but if you can live without it the car is smooth as velvet as far as driving experience goes. Spacious and really very well built. Geeleys sales staff we found were untrustworthy but the after sales is very promising it carries Volvo's technology and AGMCs elegance. You have to be unlucky in an accident to have to wait for spares because mostly they've got everything. They are building a monster of a service center in sheikh Zayed. It's very impressive. Geeleys seat cooling and AC is far better than Chery. 

We did not buy Geeley because we got put off by sales, not the product as much. I regret the decision deeply.

Haval - H9 was love at first sight, the power of the car was undeniable, the build was strong and we knew it was going to be fuel thirsty. The sales staff themselves weren't  sounding very confident about after sales, spare parts and consumer experience during accidents and mishaps. The sales themselves sounded like they wouldn't be driving their own cars unless they were driving them for free. 

Everything else in the Haval portfolio was utter garbage either design or vehicle build or engine power.

Chery - Love at first sight and a regret of a lifetime. The build looks premium, not very solid though. You'd be able to figure that out the more time you spend in and with the car.

The seat cooling is just the lower back which in the long run if you're constantly using the function and driving a lot will invite a wholesome of lower back pain and arthritis issues and you'd still be going to work or meetings with a sweaty back/shirt. Seat massage is ok, not strong enough and in time will annoy you more than provide that comfort. We were trying to put a 1TB SD card for the dashcam inbuilt in Tiggo9 coz our salesperson said it was going to be absolutely fine, only to realize the socket was unable to handle, needing 128GB found out from the service center later.

I feel they could have done a better design and given one additional AC vent in the dashboard, for now you have 4 of which the airflow is about alright not Waaoooo. The AC is not their selling point for sure. The air purifier both in Chery and Geeley is just drama, there are no details neither in advertising nor with sales nor with service center as to what grade are the air filters and if this air purification function is actually supported by a HEPA or a carbon filter. So it's just a marketing gimmick. They also made a mistake with the design of smart A/C function, when left on, if you're parked at a signal, any movement in the car or a touch to the steering feel and you experience a jerk/shock as if you got banged by someone from the back. That's smart AC switching on and off while the vehicle isn't in motion. 

The Engine of the Tiggo 8,9 is sluggish. You typically lose the power during acceleration between 30-40 and feel the disconnect at speed acceleration  of 30-40, when you accelerate somewhere after 30 and before 40 you feel the car failed you. The sales guys will give you some gob about ""that's just the way AWDs are designed etc"" which is all rubbish. They often tell you FWD will always feel to have a better pick up than AWD which is where you know they are salesmen not automotive engineers. 

Lane assist keep does not use an AI system that allows it to permit you to change lanes without warning or vibration if  the lane change indicator is switched on and the lane is clear. That's when you know the technology is Chinese not Japanese or Swiss or German.

Cockpit room is Great, boot space is good if the seventh seat/third row is flat, the infotainment screen is nice and big, apple and android both activated (which is better than Geeley) wireless charging is better than Geeley again it's not a make or break factor. 

You can't shampoo the interiors of a Chinese car in a way you did for your Nissan or Toyota etc so of you're a hygiene freak like me that is a huge gap in the market still for a new business idea for how does a company clean these cars without disturbing the tech, and when I say clean means clean not basic vacuum etc. 



Fuel efficiency is alright a full tank displays 752km but you'd get the average of 550-575.

If you've got old parents ask them to be careful when they get in the car at the back since the legs of the drivers seats at the back are not soft and the sharp metal knobs might accidentally hurt them, again the design. 

The storage space is unimpressive, the floating cabin can hold but not store things (if you're a woman you know that's a fail since we need a ton of space everywhere) there is no compartment for sunglasses or mulkiya. 

Both with Chery and Geeley the voice commands are specific English words and it's not like Google search where the AI will guess what you're trying to search and give you close results. Here it you're English maafi which practically every second person is you're basically talking to yourself, the car won't understand a word. 

The navigation of Chery isn't updated, you won't find Cherys own Dubai showroom on their navigation if you looked for it but since there's apple and android pre activated you're saved. 

Tiggo 9 - Service contract 40k (joke of the current galactic year), no discounts no registration no window tinting no insurance was being offered.  We had to use external influence for them to give us insurance and registration for the tiggo 9 the service contract remained a joke and they did not do the window tinting. 

Tiggo 7- we had to use the same external influence to get it's registration, insurance and tinting but I suppose that was also because they had a pile of those cars waiting to be offload into the market since tiggo 9 phev was due to launch in the second half of 2025. 

Our delivery of Tiggo 9 came with minor with scratches on the bonnet, no one including sales or showroom manager had any answers or an apology for it, it took 4 months to sort out a replacement bonnet and demand a lot of indecency and chaos to expedite the process, there was ton of BS they tried to give us meanwhile. They managed to do ceramic coating thrice on the same bonnet to avoid offering a replacement, but the scratches were equally adamant, a replacement car meanwhile had to be fought for, we still don't have the documentation we demanded on the repairs, let alone compensation or even an apology from the management for all the showdown we had with the showroom manager on the last day. The director of Chery whom a code of conduct complaint was submitted to against the showroom manager has been in the hiding since.

The tiggo 7 we bought at the same time is sitting in the service center since the battery of our brand new car is drained, the technicians at service center dont have any answers, in their frustration they managed to burp telling us it ain't uncommon they receive a lot of complaints for new cars having their battery drained all of a sudden which we know because theres been a post on Cherys FB group about it. Since the incident it has taken us 3 days to get someone to tow our car to the service center for them to look into it since Chery doesn't work on weekends not matter what's with you. We knew before going to the service center getting a spare car until they repair ours would be a war! 

Every time ones got to deal with Chery or it's people, when problems come thru, the solution won't find itself until you let go of your decency or the memory that you're an educated civilian. I mean we knew it wasn't Tesla, but we were not prepared for this either.

To sell the car they are AWRostamani, one group one big family, that is only until the ribbon is cut. The next day onwards you'd be a football being kicked between the service center, body shop, autotrust and the insurer.

It looked as if it was flapping around a bit, and if I put slight pressure on it, I could move the gum around. Naturally this worried me, so I had an appointment with my dentist yesterday.

My whole mouth looks nearly perfect with the exception of that one spot. My dentist said that I have some slight recession due to age (I'm 32) and possibly flossing or brushing a little too hard, which might have triggered the gum to start to flap around. He said I would need a slight gum graft and referred me to a periodontist, and I have an appointment on 1/28. He also said that it wasn't bad enough that I should get it fixed immediately, but I could probably save it for 6 months to a year from now and be fine. Naturally, I care about my teeth, so I am going to get this fixed ASAP. 

I do have some questions though. Until I am able to have the procedure done hopefully in the next month, should I avoid eating or drinking anything? My deit is fairly normal, and I have coffee nearly every day and the occasional energy drink. I just do not want to make the recession any worse.

Also, I know that the average price for this procedure is around $2k. But since I am only getting that one specific area on my bottom left canine tooth done, would it be cheaper? I do not have dental insurance so I would be paying out of pocket. 

Lastly, would I need to schedule multiple days away from work? I am a teacher so it is hard for me to just take off. And in terms of pain, what can I expect? I am really hoping that it is not too painful and I could simply take one day off and be back at work teaching.",1,1765992088.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Warning, I am seriously overthinking this: 

Every year our household has given gifts to our kids teachers. This year the budget has tightened significantly, but we want to make sure our teachers are acknowledged and appreciated this holiday. Normally, I would give gift cards and a stainless steel tumbler, but the budget is allowing for only a gc (and a reduced one at that) We purchase for the teachers, assstants, and IEP support staff. I’ve been hearing about gift card scams, and am worried about the possibility of the funds being spent. Other people have been saying not to purchase from (red circle store, blue box with yellow asterisk store, coffee chain store, and rainforest name store) due to the political climate. It’s frustrating because we just want to spread some small kindness, but don’t want to cause any annoyance. My questions are: 

1. Is $15/$25 appropriate?
2. Would a printout of a gift card code work (to avoid a potential scam) in case the physical cards are compromised? I wouldn’t know how to make this look nice, it seems ridiculous typing this out. I’m not sure if sending an e-gift card code would work due to firewalls of the school district. 
3. According to others, either Costco, grocery stores, restaurants, or clothing stores are the safe bet. I’m trying to buy 14 gift cards for teachers and staff who I don’t know! Is 🎯 the least offensive store?

I work in Cloud Ops by day, managing massive, sprawling environments in AWS and Azure. I spend my life obsessing over high availability, immutable infrastructure, and automated deployments... whenever I'm not yapping about cloud here or at r/OrbonCloud.

Yet, for the longest time, my home lab was an absolute dumpster fire of manual configurations.

I’m talking ""ssh in and apt-get install"" for everything, docker-compose files edited directly on the host, and zero documentation. If my main Proxmox node died, I knew I was looking at a miserable weekend of remembering how I set up the reverse proxy for Jellyfin five months ago. It was inefficient, fragile, and honestly, kind of embarrassing given my day job.

A few months ago, I decided to stop treating my home lab like a sandbox and started treating it like a mini production environment. The goal wasn't to spend more money, but to spend less *time* fixing things when they inevitably break.

I started small:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** I stopped manually clicking things in the Proxmox UI and started using Terraform for VM provisioning.
2. **Config Management:** I forced myself to learn Ansible for the base OS setup of my VMs. No more manual hardening or user creation.
3. **Actual Monitoring:** Instead of waiting for my wife to tell me Plex is down, I set up a basic Prometheus/Grafana stack (as seen in the pic).

It sounds like overkill, but the payoff happened last week. An SSD died in my virtualization host. In the old days, that would have been catastrophic. This time? I replaced the drive, ran a few Terraform apply and Ansible playbooks, and restored my Docker volume backups. I was back up in about 90 minutes while sipping coffee.

The efficiency gain isn't in the setup time (that took longer, admittedly), it's in the *recovery* and maintenance time.

Jon’s room is dim, curtains half-shut, and he’s curled beside you like someone dropped him there after his batteries ran out. His arm is across your stomach and he has a dread in his mouth. 

You try to sit up. The room sways. Jon groans.

“Don’t move,” he mutters into the pillow.

“I need water.”

“You don’t,” he argues, still half-asleep. “Stay thirsty forever. Live that way.”

You shove his shoulder. He finally rolls over, scrubs his face with both hands, and squints at you with one eye. He passes you the bottle of water on the nightstand.

“Here,” he says. “You look like a corpse.”

You sip it. It tastes like pennies, but it helps. You lay back down. 

“Breakfast?” he asks. “There might be a Pop-Tart or two kicking around.” 

Jon shuffles off to the kitchen, returning with a packet of toaster pastry. He sits next to you in bed, handing them to you.

“Come on. Nibble. Half a nibble. They’re strawberry.”

“You’re always such a sweetie.” You take a bite and hand them back. “Ugh. Too dry.”

He rolls his eyes and shoves the rest of the Pop-Tart into his mouth to prove it’s edible.

Somewhere in the house, someone is coughing violently.

Jon sighs. “Sounds like everyone survived.”

You follow him into the living room.

Beth is bundled in a blanket like a depressed burrito at one end of the couch. David is asleep on the other end, dead to the world. Chimp is eating dry cereal out of the box.

Beth lifts one hand lazily. “Morning, sluts.”

“Takes one to know one,” you shove her with your foot. “You alive?”

“Barely. You?”

You just shrug. She groans and pulls the blanket over her face.

Buzz stomps in with sunglasses on, flopping into an armchair. “I’m quitting alcohol. Forever.”

“That’s at least the twelfth time you’ve said that,” David mutters from his end of the couch.

“I always mean it,” Buzz protests weakly.

Chimp shakes the cereal box, frowns into it. “So really, someone stole my shoe.”

“No one stole your shoe,” David says without opening his eyes. “You took it off and tried to trade it for a cigarette.”

“Sounds fake,” Chimp replies.

“It’s not,” Beth mutters from inside her blanket. “You also told the couch you loved it.”

Buzz groans and presses his palms to his temples. “There was a fight.”

“There’s always a fight,” David says.

Jon snorts. “Someone definitely picked up Raul’s sledgehammer.”

Beth resurfaces just long enough to smirk at you. “You were AWOL for a while.”

You shrug. “I got lost.”

“In a bedroom,” she says flatly.

Jon tightens his arm around you, grinning. “It was a very confusing house.”

Beth closes her eyes again. “Perverts. I’m going back to sleep.”

Jon pulls you back against him, his breath warm on your ear.

“Is your head okay? Wanna go back to bed?”

Back in Jon’s room, you wait for the next question. It never comes.

The hangover fades. Life resumes. The next few days stack up quietly. Sleep. Work. Jon.

Everything is fine in that way that only works if you don’t poke at it.

You’re rearranging the mug shelf for the third time when you spot your mom through the front window.

She doesn’t come in right away, she just stands there, shifting on her feet like the ground is uneven. When she finally does, the bell over the door rings too loud.

“Just checking to see you’re alive,” she says, eyes moving over you like she’s taking inventory.

“Well,” you answer. “I am.”

Carl doesn’t look up from the counter, but he drifts closer.

Your mom nods, small and stiff. “Good.”

You don’t say anything else, and after a moment she turns and leaves the store. The bell seems quieter on her way out.

Carl finally looks up. “You want me to pretend I didn’t see that?”

“Would you?”

He nods once. “Consider it forgotten.”

Later, when Jon picks you up, you tell him about it in the car.

He glances at you in the rearview. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” you say. “Mostly. It was weird to see her there.”

“So,” he says. “Moving day soon.”

“Yeah. Soon. Like, next week.”

“Cool,” he says. “I can help.”

You laugh. “It’s not like either of us have a lot of stuff, but thanks.”

Moving day arrives and the first thing you and Beth do is go to pick up your new keys. The landlord’s office smells like old carpet and lemon cleaner. He hands you some lease forms and talks you through them, shows you where to sign.

He slides the keys across the desk like he’s doing you a favour. Beth doesn’t blink, she just slides the envelope across the desk. 

Watching her hand it over makes your stomach unclench. Rent. Deposit. All of it. Gone from your hands and officially somewhere else.

Your landlord thumbs through the bills and nods, satisfied.

“Welcome home,” he says.

Beth snorts. “Let’s not get sentimental. Also, I’d like a receipt.”

The place seems smaller than you remembered, but it’s yours. Yours and Beth’s. The walls are scuffed and the carpet has seen better years, but the windows open and the lock works and nobody’s going to barge in drunk and angry and unpredictable. That feels like luxury.

Outside, the sun feels brighter than it did ten minutes ago. Beth jingles the keys once, like she’s testing reality.

“You realize,” she says, “that if he’d tried anything shady, I was prepared to hurt him.”

“I could tell,” you say. “You had murder eyes.”

She grins, wide and a little stunned. “We did it.”

Carl’s truck is already idling at the curb when you get back, the bed lined with blankets that look older than you are. David leans against the door with a coffee in one hand, looking mildly annoyed, as usual. Jon and Buzz are still sitting inside, poking through the glovebox. 

You’d spent the evenings with Beth this week packing stuff up, so everything’s ready to go when you all head up into her suite. 

Beth claps her hands once. “Okay. Nobody drop anything, nobody die, and if you break it you buy it.”

“None of this is buyable,” Buzz says, hefting a lamp with a crooked shade.

Jon grabs the end of Beth’s couch. It groans when he and David lift it.

“This thing reeks,” he says.

“That’s character,” Beth shoots back. “That’s history.”

“History of spilled bong water,” Jon says, laughing as they maneuver it toward the door.

You hover uselessly for a second, hands half-raised, not sure where to start. Beth notices it immediately.

“Hey,” she says, softer. “You’re fine. Go get the boxes with the important stuff and put them in my trunk.”

You nod, relieved to be given a job.

Back outside, Jon hops down from the truck bed and wipes his hands on his jeans. He catches your eye and smiles, like this is just what people do on Saturdays. Like even if everything falls apart, someone’s gonna show up with a truck.

Beth directs traffic like a deranged foreman, half bossy, half giddy: “No, not that box. It says ‘DO NOT DROP.’ Why would you even grab the one that says ‘DO NOT DROP’?”

“It felt like a challenge,” Buzz says, already backing away.

By late afternoon, everything is technically moved, even if it’s all over the place. The couch is crooked. The table wobbles. Someone’s already lost Beth’s screwdriver. 

Everyone’s collapsed wherever there’s room. The floor. The couch. The counter. Buzz is sitting cross-legged, staring into nothing.

“I think,” he announces, “I just lost three years of my life.”

“It’s better to die young, anyway,” Beth says.

The ancient intercom buzzes. Beth buzzes back: “Who’s there?”

Carl’s voice crackles through the speaker. “I’ve got food,” he says. “Figured you’d all be tired.”

“Uncle Carl comin’ in clutch,” David says gleefully. 

Carl comes in with two paper bags and a cardboard tray of drinks.

Beth looks at it, then at him. “You didn’t have to.”

“I know,” Carl says, setting everything down. He doesn’t linger, just pokes his head into the rooms. “Don’t burn it down,” he says as he leaves.

You’re on the floor, back against the wall. Jon drops down beside you, passing you a drink. The room hums. Smoke curls. Laughter drifts in and out.

Beth stands in the doorway, lights a cigarette, and takes it all in.

She exhales smoke toward the ceiling. Grins.

“Well,” she says. “Now we just gotta fill it with bad decisions.”

You look around. You have a place of your own, you have friends. It feels warm. Solid. Like something that won’t vanish if you blink. 

“Maybe a few good ones, too,” you say.

Beth smiles wider at that.",1,1765991387.0,u_ScenicAbattoir,0,1.0,False
1pp201t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pp201t/whats_the_move/,What’s the move,"So basically there’s this girl (22f) at uni who takes the same class as me (21m). When I laid my eyes on her I thought to myself “okay she’s cute I kinda wanna talk to her” so I did. Fast forward two weeks later she comes in class pretty sad and it looked like she was crying I sat beside and asked her what’s wrong and told her that we’d go and have a cup of coffee and discuss why she’s this sad and we did. This was the first time us meeting outside of class. She told me the reason she was sad is because a guy (turns out to be her ex or currently dating still) caught her walking around in uni wearing a “revealing” outfit I guess? So obviously I comforted her and I admitted to her that I was into her and wanted to talk to her on a deeper level she replied saying “yea I feel better and good and happy whenever I’m around you” I got her number and we started chatting normally then about 2 weeks later she suddenly starts replying less and less. I was confused so I confronted her about it she gave me the “ I’m dealing with a lot of problems at my home and a lot of work issues” I was like okay it’s fine take your time to reply but let me know beforehand if you’re dealing with stuff like that. News flash she still was taking too long to reply,because I like this girl a lot I confronted her once again about the same topic and she told me that she’s not ready to take anything serious and she “just got out of a relationship” and I insisted to know if she was letting me off easily or she genuinely can’t and obviously she said she actually can’t. Fast forward around a month I peek through the class window and I see that girl walking down the campus with a dude and seemed like they were just talking but then that guy reaches in for a hug but that girl then lowers his hands basically not letting him do that. At that point I was mad as fuck because I’m pretty sure this guy was the same one that argued with her about her style. Anyways the next day I decided to confront her about what I saw so I told her let’s meet after class I wanna talk to you about something important she said “okay I’ll text you when I’m able to”. Guess what she’s still yet to send me a message (that was about 2 days ago) so idk man",1,1765991356.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1pp1xks,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pp1xks/a_dead_boy_has_been_hunting_me_down_my_whole_life/,"A dead boy has been hunting me down my whole life. On my 18th birthday, I finally understand why.","On my eighth birthday, a shadow strode into my house and shot me and my family dead. 

I remember it vividly, every detail, every angle, etched and stained and carved into my memory.

I sat very still with my knees to my chest, my gaze glued to my siblings. 

Lily and PJ looked like they were sleeping, and I could almost believe it. 

I didn't look at the shadow. 

From the comfort of my knees, I waited for my brother to lift his head.

But his body was so limp, so still, every part of him faltering. 

My sister’s head was nestled in his shoulder, thick beads of red running down her face. 

*They're just sleeping.*

I could tell myself they were— as long as I didn't look at the splatter of scarlet staining the back of the couch and pooling at their feet. 

*BANG*. 

Mom’s body dropped onto the ground. 

I lunged forwards, slamming my hands over my ears. 

*BANG*. 

PJ’s head slumped forwards, a teasing smile still frozen on his lips.

*BANG*. 

Lily gently tipped into PJ, like she was 
going to sleep. 

Before she closed her eyes, Mom told me to *run*. 

I can't remember how long I stayed under the shattered remnants of Mom’s favorite table. The shadow was waiting for me to move, to make a noise. 

I watched booted feet crunch through glass, getting closer and closer, and slowly, fight or flight began to take over. 

Making it halfway across the living room, my palms slick with my mother’s blood, I thought I was going to live. 

Cruel fingers wound their way through my hair and shoved me to my knees. 

I remember the phantom legs of a spider creeping down the back of my neck when the shadow with no face dragged the barrel of his gun down my spine. 

“Turn around.”

The shadow had a voice. 

When I didn't move, the protruding metal stabbed into my neck. 

“Turn *around*, kid!”

I did, very slowly. 

Behind him, my siblings still weren't moving. 

They were asleep. 

Lily was still smiling, strawberry blonde ringlets stained red. 

I couldn't see PJ’S face anymore.  

*BANG.*

I didn't feel the gunshot. 

I didn't *feel* anything. 

Looking down, I glimpsed slowly spreading red blossoming like a flower. 

It felt like being cut from strings.

I hit the ground, just like my mother, my body felt heavy and wrong. 

Paralysed. 

I remember being unable to scream, unable to cry, the salty taste of metal filling my mouth. It was like being winded. 

Rolling onto my side, all I could see was flickering candlelight. 

The air was thick, so hard to breathe.

I rolled onto my back trying to suck in air.

The shadow took a step back, opened the front door, and bled into the night. 

I don't remember the pain, and I don't remember dying. I couldn't breathe, couldn't conjure words in my mouth. 

I felt warm and sticky, lying in my own blood.

I think I tried to move. 

But I was so tired. 

I’m not sure what death feels like, because it's like going to sleep.

I remember my last shuddering breaths, a lulling darkness beginning to swallow me up. I don't know why I wasn't afraid. 

Oblivion almost felt like I was sinking into lukewarm depths on a Summer’s day. 

Oblivion wasn't pain, and there was a peaceful inevitability to it. 

It was endless nothing, a *nothing* I found myself gravitating towards. 

But before I could envelope myself in that darkness, it was spitting me back out. 

The next thing I knew, I was in a white room, a slow beeping sound tearing me from slumber. I had a vague memory of slow spreading roses blossoming across my shirt, like summer flowers blooming. 

Everything was white. 

The walls, the ceiling, and my clothes.

Sensation hit me in slow waves. 

Exhaustion. 

I felt it tightening its grip around my brain, dragging me back onto a mountain of pillows when I tried to jump up. My Aunt May was sitting next to me on a plastic chair, her warm fingers entangled in mine. 

Aunt May and Mom were practically twins, with the same thick red hair and pale skin. 

Mom wore her hair in a casual ponytail, while May preferred a strict bun. 

I had to bite back the urge to yank my hand away. 

Aunt May was asleep, used tissues filling her lap.

There was a nurse pottering around, checking my vitals and prodding my arms. 

My eyes felt heavy. I had to blink several times to keep myself awake. 

“Charlie?”

The nurse’s voice was like wind-chimes.

I pretended not to notice her forced lipstick smile, the way she stood with her arms folded, staring at me like I was one of my cousin’s experiments. 

“You were in an accident, sweetie,” the nurse spoke up. I could see her trembling hands. “Just, um, try and rest, okay?”

I wanted to ask where my family was, but I already knew the answer. 

I think she knew that too. 

“You died, Charlie.” The nurse’s voice was eerily cold. “You were dead for thirteen minutes.” 

She took slow steps towards me, her eyes growing frenzied, like she couldn't understand me, like I was a puzzle she could not solve– and it was driving her crazy. I could see it in her twitching hands, her wobbling lips that were trying and failing to appear stoic. 

“In fact, I just pulled you out of the morgue, honey. I opened up your body bag that I had just zipped up, and told your aunt that you were a miracle I just… can’t understand.” 

The nurse sounded like she was trying to choke down a laugh, or maybe a sob. 

“Charlotte, you were pronounced dead at 3:02am from a gunshot wound to the chest.”  Taking a slow, sobering breath, the nurse tried to smile. 

“The bullet went through the right ventricle of your heart and severely damaged your left lung, rendering you unable to breathe. Your heart stopped, and after four attempts to resuscitate, we called it.”

Something slimy wound its way up my throat when she began to pace the room. 

“I… did all the paperwork. It took me two minutes. Your death certificate was signed, and your body was taken to the morgue to be prepped for transportation. Then I had my lunch. Tuna salad with a protein milkshake. I’m not a fan of the chocolate flavor.” 

She shook her head. “Anyway, when I came back to you, you were awake inside your body bag.” 

Her voice was starting to break. “You were…um, alive, and asked me for apple soda.”

The nurse moved closer, and yet kept her distance.

I could feel myself moving back, panic writhing through me. 

“So.” The nurse spoke calmly. “*How* the fuck are you still alive, Charlie?”

I think I passed out after that. 

When I woke up again, my head a lot less heavier, the nurse was gone.

Slowly, my foggy brain began to find itself and connect dots.

My mouth was dry, full of cotton. 

There was a sudden tightness, a sharp and cruel sting in my wrists. 

Something sharp was protruding into my flesh, and no matter how many times I violently wrenched my arm, it was stuck. It didn't feel right to be able to breathe so easily.

I knew the second I woke that my Mom was dead. 

Lily and PJ were dead, and it was like losing them all over again. 

As clarity came over me, I found my voice, a strangled cry escaping my lips. 

“Get it out.” I whispered in a shrill cry. 

Tugging at the IV in my wrist, I tried to yank the needle from my skin. 

“Get it out!” I shrieked, my gaze glued to the tiny spots of blood staining the insertion point.

I could see it again. 

So much blood. 

Mom was curled up on the floor, lying in slow spreading red that wouldn't stop, seeping across her beaded rug. 

She was all over me, slick on my skin and caked in my fingernails. 

*I couldn't wash her off of me.*

“You're okay, Charlotte.”

Aunt May’s voice came from my right, stabling me to reality. 

The world started to move again, started to make sense again, when she cupped my cheeks and told me to breathe. 

When I opened my mouth to ask where my family were, she lightly shook her head and I swallowed my words. 

Aunt May handed me a glass of water, and I drained it in one gulp.

*She told me I was a miracle.* 

Aunt May didn't say much, and when she did, she broke into sobs. 

Her eyes were raw from crying, clinging onto me, her shuddery voice reassuring me that I was going to be okay. 

She told me I would be living with her from now on, before wrapping me into a hug and leaving to get coffee. 

Once my aunt was gone, another nurse came to prod my IV. 

I tried to sleep, but the uncomfortable tightness of the needle sticking into my skin and the sterile white lights in my eyes made it impossible. 

I waited for grief to catch up with me, drowning me in a hollow oblivion I wouldn't be able to claw myself out of. 

But I didn't feel *sad*. I didn't feel angry. 

I wanted to know why my family were dead. 

I wanted to know *why* I was breathing, and their skin was ice cold. 

Rotting. 

The sudden image of maggots crawling up my brother’s nose sent me lurching into a sitting position, my stomach heaving. 

Reaching for my glass of water, it was empty. The sensation of throwing up felt familiar, almost comforting. 

Mom was always with me when I was sick, holding my hair back and lulling my hysteria with reassuring murmurs. 

I was frowning at the trash can by the door, my cotton candy brain trying to figure out if I would be able to make it in time, when a small voice drifted from the doorway, startling me. 

“I don't want you to come live with us.” 

My cousin was peeking through the door, hiding behind a shock of dark brown curls. Jude was the only brunette in our family. The rest of us were redheads. 

I wasn't sure why he was dressed up like a ghost, draped in a white cloak that was way too big for him. Jude was a weird kid. 

His mother, and my auntie, had inherited the family house, so in his mind, that made him superior. 

Jude made it clear he didn't like his cousins, refusing to let us play with him and banning us from family gatherings. 

When the adults were drinking cocktails and losing their awareness, Jude ordered us around. 

The times we *did* play with him, our cousin  showed us his spider collection, or the raccoon brain he kept in a jar. 

PJ was convinced our younger cousin was a serial killer. Several months earlier, he'd happily showed us the roadkill he'd been growing bacteria on under his bed. 

Jude’s ‘experiments’ were worrying. 

He stuffed mushrooms down my brother’s ears while he was sleeping, to, and I quote, “Recreate The Last Of Us.”

When Lily had a nosebleed during Thanksgiving dinner, Jude collected all her bloody tissues and refused to tell us where he'd put them, and *what* he had done with them. Fast-forward two months, and I found them under a nest of spiders. 

Jude was trying to adapt the spiders to be able to feed on human blood. 

I was surprised my cousin hadn't immediately demanded to see my siblings’ dead bodies for autopsy. 

Jude stepped into the room, shuffling his feet. 

“I'm sorry about Lily, PJ, and Aunt Ivy.” He mumbled, glaring at the floor tiles. 

My cousin made no move to offer real sympathy, instead speaking to the floor. 

“But I don't want you to come live with us.” Jude lifted his head, looking me dead in the eye. “I don't like you, Charlie. I want you to stay away.”

Before I could reply, he stepped back like I was diseased.

“You should be *dead*.” Jude grumbled. 

He scowled at me, getting my age purposely wrong as usual before running off. 

*“Happy 68th birthday.”*

I was six months older than him. 

In Jude’s eyes, I was ready for retirement. 

Still, though, my cousin was right. 

I was stone cold dead, and then I was somehow alive.

Which *was* wrong. 

Growing up, I realized Death was not so subtly attempting to fix his mistake. 

It started small. I'd choke on things I wasn't supposed to choke on. 

Chips. 

Candy. 

*Ice cream.*

Aunt May had to perform the heimlich manoeuvre when I choked on a piece of chicken. I thought I was just really unlucky, but then I locked myself in a freezer that didn't have a lock, and almost drowned in the local swimming pool, catching my foot in stray netting.

At the summer fair, Jude convinced me to try apple bobbing, only for my head to *conveniently* get stuck underwater. 

It started to make sense. 

I was supposed to die with my family that night, and death was out to get me.

Death started to get clever, changing his tactic. Instead of using everyday things to try to kill me, he sent reinforcements.

I turned twelve years old, and my aunt threw me a huge party, inviting all my classmates. Aunt May was *rich*, rich. 

Mom never explained it, but our grandparents left everything to May. 

The house was like a palace, a labyrinth of floors I was yet to explore, and two swimming pools. 

I was in the kitchen cutting myself a slice of cake, when, out of nowhere, a dead boy came rushing at me with one of my aunt’s favorite kitchen knives. 

A dead boy who I immediately recognised. 

Wren Oliver. 

Several years prior, he'd gone missing  from his parents' yard. The town launched a full investigation, only to find his body in a ditch a week later. 

*So, Death had sent a footsoldier*. 

Hiding under a hooded sweatshirt, Wren appeared older, like he had grown up with me. But there was a startling vacancy in his expression that drew the breath from my lungs, freezing me in place. 

Wren’s death was announced as an accident, though his wounds suggested the opposite, dried blood smearing his right temple and a cavernous hole in his chest, his clothes painted, stained, in bright red, glued in sticky mounds clinging to him. 

The boy’s eyes were wild, feral, like an animal. 

His hair was longer, a mess of reddish curls matted to his forehead. 

Lip split into a demented giggle. 

I remember taking a slow step back, my gaze glued to the knife. 

Wren’s fingers were wrapped around the handle like he knew exactly how to use it, how to plunge it into my heart and kill me for good. 

He moved like a predator, zero self awareness or recognition, only driven to kill me. 

The dead  boy prided himself in slow, intimidating steps, shoving me against the wall and dragging the blade of the knife down the curve of my throat. 

His eyes confused me, writhing with hatred that was artificial, programmed into him as Death’s official soldier.

He didn't speak, only smiled, revelling in my fear. I could tell it thrilled him, my trembling hands, my sharp, heavy breaths I couldn't control. Squeezing my eyes shut, I waited to finally die. 

I waited for the pain, and to lose my breath once again. 

But death was playing with me. 

When I opened my eyes, the dead boy was gone, and I was on my knees, screaming. 

“Wren Oliver is trying to kill me!"" I managed to hiss. 

My aunt knelt in front of me, her expression crumpling.

*Sweetie,” She spoke softly, squeezing my hands. Aunt May was trying to appear calm for my sake, but I could tell she was scared, her frantic eyes searching mine. “Wren Oliver is dead.”

The kids surrounding me started to giggle, whispering among themselves.

In the corner of my eye, my cousin was leaning against the door, mid eye roll. 

When my aunt was ushering kids back to the pool, Jude came to crouch in front of me. Ever since I started living with him, he'd made sure to keep his distance. 

This time, though, Jude leaned uncomfortably close, a sparkle in his eyes I had never seen before. Inclining his head, he rocked back and forth on his heels, prodding me in the forehead.

“If you see the dead boy again, can you tell me?” His lips curved into a smile. 

“I *did* see him.” I gritted out. “I’m not lying.”

Jude shrugged. “I never said you didn't,” he lowered his voice into a whisper, “I wanna know when you see him again.”

“Why?”

His lips curved into a smirk. 

“So, I can catch him.”

My cousin got closer, his breath tickling my cheek. 

“I seeeeeeee dead people.” 

After that incident, death left me alone for a while.

I was fifteen, walking through the forest with a friend, catching fireflies in bell jars. 

Aunt May was lucky to live so close to the forest, the entrance just outside her back door. 

When we were littles, PJ would drag Lily and I down the trail to escape Jude’s weird experiments. 

I decided to invite Jem Littlewood on a summer walk. 

Jem was cute, but in a dorky way. He was chronically clumsy, and dressed like he'd been spat out of a John Hughes movie. 

We hiked all the way to the end of the river and had a picnic, watching the sun set over the horizon. I was having conflicting feelings for this guy. 

Jem was *obsessed* with fireflies.

Though he seemed more interested in photographing them than me. 

The guy couldn't seem to sit still, jumping to his feet to marvel at tiny specks of light dancing in the air. 

“I'm just going to take photos!” Jem beamed, holding up his camera. 

I had to bite back the urge to say, “Don't you have *enough* photos?”

I nodded, and he turned and sprinted back down the trail. 

Before his footsteps ground to a sudden halt. 

At first, I thought he was snapping polaroids. 

When I got closer, though, blinking in the eerie dark, I caught something.

Bending down, I picked up a bell jar still spilling fireflies. 

Further down the trail, Jem was lying crumpled in the dirt, his camera smashed to pieces next to him, blood running in thick rivulets down his temple. 

There he was. Leaning against a tree, his arms folded, was the ghost boy. Wren Oliver was growing up with me. 

Now, a teenager, and yet his face was carved into something else entirely, more of a monster, slight points to his ears and too-sharp teeth, eyes ignited. 

Wren didn't look like a ghost boy anymore. 

Death had dressed him in shackles of ivy, a crown of glass and bone forced onto his head, entangled in his curls. Death was torturing him. 

Wren’s body was its canvas, and every time I got away, he was punished, painting his failures across scarred skin. 

I should have been running for my life, but I was mesmerised by each symbol cruelly carved into his neck. 

The boy did a slow head incline, like he couldn't believe I was standing in front of him.

His slow spreading smile caught me off guard. 

I remembered how to run, stumbling over my feet.

But I couldn't move. 

The burning hatred that death had filled him with, was stronger, hollowing him out completely. I managed two shaky steps, before I felt him, an unearthly force winding its way around my spine. This time, he didn't hesitate. 

I watched his mouth move, a single curve of his upper lip that wrenched my body from my control, slamming me against a tree. There was something around my throat, choking the breath from my lungs,  a thick fog spreading over my eyes. 

Following his mouth curving into silent letters, I could feel my feet slowly leaving the ground, my legs dangling.

I was floating. 

Hovering off of the ground, suspended by his words. 

Through half lidded eyes, I caught the glint of a blade between his fist, but I couldn't move, couldn't scream.

He was drowning me, bleeding into my blood, spider webbing and expanding in my brain without moving a muscle. 

Instead, the ghost boy stood silently, running his thumb down the teeth of his knife while he ripped my lungs apart. 

It was like suffocating, sinking into that peaceful oblivion I met at eight years old. 

This time, though, the darkness was starving. 

“Charlie?”

My eyes found daylight, a scream clawing out of my mouth. 

“Charlie, it's past curfew!”

Wren flinched, his stoic expression crumpling.

The dead boy’s lips moved again, this time in a curse. 

*Fuck*.

“Charlotte!”

Staggering back, Wren’s eyes widened and the suffocating hold on me severed.

His head snapped in the direction my aunt was coming from. 

“Charlie, answer me right now.”

He hesitated, his bare feet pivoting in the dirt, like he was considering finishing me off. Wren studied me with lazy eyes, sucking on his bottom lip. 

When my aunt's footsteps got louder, branches snapping under her shoes, something contorted in the boy’s face. 

Fear. 

I guessed the boy wasn't expecting other humans to intrude. 

Wren fell over himself, shuffling on his hands and knees, before diving to his feet. 

When he turned and ran, I was released, slipping to the ground, trying and failing to draw in breath. I barely felt the impact, only a dull thudding pain. I could hear the ghost boy’s footsteps, his uneven, shuddery breaths as he catapulted into a run. 

Under a late setting sun, I watched his dancing shadow disappear into the trees. 

*Mission unsuccessful, I guessed*. 

When I was fully conscious, Aunt May was checking over Jem, helping him sit up. 

“Where did he go?” I managed to get out, scanning the darkness for Wren. 

“He's okay, just concussed.” May whispered, dialling 911. 

My aunt applied a dressing to Jem’s wound, ignoring the boy’s hisses. 

“Keep still.” she murmured, smoothing his bandaid. “What happened, Charlotte?”

“She pushed me over.” Jem groaned, shuffling away from me. When my aunt told him to stay calm, he straightened up, leaning against the tree. “The psycho bitch tried to fucking kill me!”

When my aunt's gaze flicked to me, I shook my head. 

“It was Wren Oliver.” I gritted, teetering on hysteria. I could tell she didn't believe me, but I couldn't stop myself. 

I prodded at my throat, clawing for the indentations where his phantom fingers snaked around my neck, squeezing the breath from my lungs.

But there was nothing.

I could feel my mind starting to unravel. I nodded to my disgruntled classmate trying to dodge my aunt’s prodding. 

*“Ow, ow, ow! That stings!*

“He knocked Jem out.” I managed. “Then he tried to kill me.”

Jem surprised me with a scoff. “You're seriously blaming your psychotic break on a dead kid?”

Aunt May pursed her lips, motioning for Jem to be quiet. Judging from her face, however, she agreed with the boy. 

May forced a smile, though it didn't quite reach her eyes. “Okay. Can you, uh, describe the boy to me, Charlotte?”

“He was wearing a crown,” I said, “And he looked my age.”

Aunt May cocked her head, and I saw real worry, like she was trying not to freak out. Jem made a snorting noise. 

“I'm sorry, he was wearing a *crown*?”

“Yes!” I insisted, getting progressively more frustrated. 

I tried to jump up, only for my aunt to gently lower me back down. “I know it sounds crazy, but death has sent Wren Oliver to kill me, just like my family. He tried to kill me when I was twelve, too!”

Jem let out a bitter laugh. “Your niece is a fucking wackadoodle.”

Aunt May’s eyes darkened. She grabbed my shoulders, her nails stabbing into my skin. “Charlie, I want you to *listen* to me, okay?” When my eyes found the rapidly darkening sky, my aunt forced me to look at her. 

“Charlotte!” 

She was as scared as me, her voice shuddering. 

“Wren Oliver is dead.” My aunt said firmly, shaking me. Even then, though, I wasn't even looking at her. I was trying to find his ignited eyes lighting up the dark. 

“Wren died at eight years old in a terrible accident, and you can't keep using him as an excuse for your mental trauma.” 

There was something twitching in her expression I was trying to make sense of. When I risked a look at Jem, the boy was staring at me dazedly– like I really was crazy. 

Aunt May pressed her face into my shoulder, and I could feel her tears soaking into my shirt. She was trying to hold it together, trying to understand. 

“Charlie, I know you lost your family,” she whispered. “But you and Wren Oliver are not the same. You survived, and he didn't.” Her voice splintered.

“You need to come to terms with that, okay?”

When I didn't respond, she pinched my chin, forcing me to look at her. 

“Charlotte.”  

Aunt May’s voice turned cold. “I ignored this when you were a kid, but if you continue to use this poor boy as a coping mechanism, I will have no choice but to send you to a specialist.”

When Jem was taken away by paramedics, Aunt May held my hand, squeezing my fingers for dear life.

I caught her gaze scanning the tree's around us, delving into twisting oblivion. Every little noise sent her twisting around. She was looking for something. 

“I'm going to get you help.” Aunt May said in a low murmur when we were back at the house. Jude was sitting on the kitchen counter, legs swinging. I could feel his penetrating gaze burning into the back of my head. 

Aunt May set a cup of cocoa on the table.

“No more fairytales.” 

By the time I was eighteen, I had bitten three therapists. 

They refused to believe that death was coming to reclaim my soul, and was using a dead boy to do his dirty work. 

For my 16th birthday, I braced myself to come face to face with Wren Oliver’s ghost.

I wasn't even in town, staying at a friend's house. 

But dead boys, and especially dead boys moulded into Death’s personal soldiers, could materialise anywhere.

I locked every door in the house, and taped up my friend’s window.

Nothing happened. 

On my seventeenth birthday, I was sick in bed with gastritis. 

Still no ghost boy. 

Death seemed to have finally left me alone. 

On my eighteenth birthday, I was stuffing books in my locker when my cousin popped up out of nowhere, scowling as usual. 

After an unexpected growth spurt and losing a tonne of baby fat, my cousin had scaled the high school hierarchy, swapping his weird experiments for a varsity jacket and *experimenting* with his sexuality. 

The two of us had come to an unspoken truce. 

I kept quiet about his spider collection to his popular friends, and he *tolerated* my existence until I left for college.

“Your surprise party is cancelled.”

Jude  leaned against my locker, running a hand through thick dark hair tucked under a baseball cap. Jude never admitted it, but he was definitely embarrassed of being the odd one out. 

My siblings may be dead, but they were *still* redheads.

I pulled off his cap with a smile, throwing it in his face. “Sure it is.”

My cousin’s eyes widened. He lost his slick bravado, grabbing for his cap. 

“Hey!”

According to my cousin, my party was unexpectedly cancelled *every* year. 

I wasn't sure if it was his weird superiority complex, or just plain jealousy, but it was getting exhausting.

Jude followed me down the hallway, matching my stride. 

“Can you just *not* come home tonight?”

I quickened my pace. “It's only a party. I'm having some friends over, and no, we won't go anywhere near your room.”

“No, I *mean*.” Jude stepped in front of me, and for the first time in a while, he wasn't trying to hide disdain for me. 

His dark eyes pinned me in place for a moment, the world around us coming to a halt. Sound bled away, and all I heard were his slow breaths. There was something there, an unexplainable twitch in his eyes and lips, that twisted my gut. 

Jude stepped closer, his lip curling. He shoved me back, losing his facade. 

“Stay the fuck away from the house tonight.” He said, and his voice, his tone, was enough to send shivers creeping down my spine. Jude had always hid behind a ten foot wall in his mind. 

It was jarring to see something in him finally start to splinter. *Fuck.* I thought. 

*This kid had serious Mommy issues.* 

I blinked, and the world resumed, kids pushing past us. 

Jude seemed to catch himself, slipping back under his mask. 

“I'm having friends over,” he rolled his eyes, “Your presence will ruin the vibe.”

“It's *my* birthday?”

He groaned, tipping his head back. “Yes, I know. But–”

“I *think* you can deal with the attention off of you for one night, Jude.”

“Will Wren Oliver be there too?” Jem Littlewood hollered.

Jude didn't respond for a moment, his lip curling. 

“Shut the fuck up.” He spat at Jem, who immediately backed down. 

With an audience this time, Jude forced an award winning smile. 

“Fine.” His lips split into a grin I knew he hated. My cousin clamped his hand on my shoulder, hard enough to hurt. I could feel his fingers pinching the material of my jacket. “Have it your way, dude.”

Jude backed away with a two fingered salute.

“Happy 78th birthday!” 

In a sense, I wish I listened to my cousin. 

My party was a success, sort of. 

Four of us, a crate of beers, and no sign of my cousin. 

I was mildly tipsy, sitting on the edge of the pool, dangling my legs in the water when my friend demanded more beers. 

I was also hungry for cake, so I stumbled inside in search of the goods. 

The house was dark, lit up in dazzling blue from the pool's lights reflecting through the windows. 

Aunt May was in her office on the ground floor, and Jude was getting high in his room. In my drunken state, I found myself marvelling my aunt's house, and how much of it was left unexplored. 

For example, in the foyer, past the spiral staircase she’d had custom made, was an elevator I had never questioned. 

There was a girl my age standing on the staircase.

She was frozen, mid run, dressed in ragged jeans and t-shirt. 

Everything about her stuck out to me, bringing me to a sobering halt. 

The girl reminded me of my sister– or at least, if my sister had ever grown up. 

I wasn't sure if I was drunk or hallucinating. 

Her flower crown was pretty…

*Lily had grown wings.*

I was slowly moving towards her, a sudden bang sounding from the kitchen.

The *bang* of something shattering on the floor.

Twisting around, I found myself gravitating towards warm golden light. 

The first thing I saw was the refrigerator door hanging open, and someone, no, *something*, rooting around inside it. 

Glued to the spot, I dazedly watched them grab milk, guzzling it down, and then soda, cracking open each can and sucking them dry, before carving their fingers into my birthday cake. 

But I wasn't looking at the spillage of food seeping across the floor. 

Instead, my gaze found a crown of antlers, both human and animal bone entangled with dead flowers and human remains glued to a head of familiar matted brown curls. 

There was something sticking from battered and bruised flesh, twin gaping slits sliced through a torn shirt resembling glass wings that were not yet formed, reminding me of a butterfly.

*Wings.*

But not the wings I dreamed of as a kid. These things were unnatural mounds that both did and didn't make sense on a human boy. I could see the trauma of them slicing through his flesh, monstrous, looming things protruding from what was left of a human spine. 

Human, and yet I couldn't call his beautifully grotesque face *human*. 

Wren Oliver had grown up with me, now an adult. 

Eighteen years old. 

His clothes confused me, a single white shirt and shorts. 

Wren’s feet were bare, battered and bruised, blood smearing my aunt's tiles. 

*Angel.*

Death had turned his footsoldier, and my future killer, into an angel. 

But there was nothing angelic about the dead boy, his body and mind sculpted and moulded into Death’s own. 

The boy no longer resembled a human, feral eyes and a manic smile, choking down pieces of cake. 

His face had been contorted into a monster, gnashing teeth and sharp points in his ears, a sickly tinge to malnourished skin. 

And that's when it hit me, watching him stuff himself with food.

Something slimy inched its way up my throat.

The boy didn't move. I don't even think he'd noticed me, gorging himself on anything he could get his hands on. 

Chicken, raw bacon, leftover salad. 

When he moved onto cupcakes, licking frosting from his fingers, I glimpsed markings on his arms, a language I didn't understand, carved into him.

His wrists were shackled, bound, in entangled iron and vine, iron that was ingrained into his skin, vines and flowers and ivy entangling his bones, that were part of him, polluting his blood. Slowly, my eyes found stab wounds splitting open his torso.

Raw flesh, where his skin had been torched, melting, and then merging, ripped apart and put back together over and over again. 

I found his heart, the gaping cavern in his chest where it should be.

And it was. 

Marked, carved, and branded with a symbol resembling an X. 

Wren Oliver was not *dead*. 

But, just like me, he should have been. 

I remember saying his name, my voice slurred slightly. 

I didn't drink *that* much, but I could barely coerce words, my head spinning. 

Wren’s neck snapped towards me, his eyes narrowing with resentment I couldn't understand, hatred that seemed to puppeteer him. Slowly tilting his head, the boy’s lips split into a grin, eyes filled, polluted, with mania.

I could see where his lips had been stitched shut, and then ripped open.

“Hi.”  

He held up his hand in an awkward wave. 

When one of my friends stumbled into the kitchen, Wren reacted on impulse. 

He picked up a knife from the counter, throwing it like a dart, straight through the guy’s throat. 

Something shattered inside my mind. 

Ignoring my friend bleeding out, Wren stumbled over himself, abandoning his feast. He took a single step towards me, backing me against the wall, coming so close, close enough for me to feel his very real breath grazing my cheeks. Just like when he was a kid, he traced the teeth of his blade down my throat. I wasn't expecting him to burst out laughing, trembling with hysteria. 

His eyes were wild, feral and wrong, almost euphoric. 

With what all I could only recognise as *relief.*

**BANG**. 

I was barely aware of the gunshot. 

The bullet went straight through his head, the winged boy hitting the ground. 

Dead. 

I saw the blood stemming around him in a halo before the bleeding pool faltered, seeping back inside his head. 

Like rewinding a VCR. 

Wren was dead, and then he was alive. 

Wren’s body contorted, his chest inflating. 

His gasp for air was painful, strangled, eyes opening wide. 

*Terrified.*

“You fucking idiot.”

Jude’s voice sent me twisting around. 

My cousin stood in the exact same robes he wore as a child. 

The world tipped off kilter, and I was on my knees, then my stomach. 

I sunk to the floor, my thoughts swimming. 

Jude’s murmur followed me, creeping into the dark.

“I told you not to come home.”

I can't remember how long I was unconscious for. 

When I woke, I was dressed in an evening gown, a dress that used to be my mother’s.  

My vision cleared, and I found myself sitting in an unfamiliar room resembling an abandoned swimming hall. 

The pool itself was empty, the bottom stained revealing scarlet. 

There were symbols carved into each tile.

Like a game. 

“Sit up straight, Charlotte.”

I was sitting at a banquet. 

Jude was in front of me, sipping on wine. 

He caught my eye for half a second before averting his gaze. 

At the far end of the table sat my aunt May. 

Kissing the rim of her glass, her smile was twisted. 

“I've been waiting so long to give you your birthday presents, Charlotte. Your memories should be returning soon.”

“Mom.” Jude muttered, hiding behind his glass. “Calm down. You're embarrassing yourself.”

Ignoring my cousin, May tapped her glass with a fork, and in walked my *birthday presents.*

No, dragged. 

By their hair. 

Wren Oliver, the dead boy, was in fact my aunt's prisoner. 

Behind him, was the girl who looked so much like Lily. 

I think that's why my aunt chose her. 

Aunt May cleared her throat. 

“For a long time, our family has lived among creatures who live in the forest you played inside. In exchange for keeping this town safe, they only ask for small favors. Wayward children who disappear into the woods are good enough payment. Charlie, you and your siblings do not share our inheritance. Your mother never wanted fae children. She wanted you to be human.” 

Aunt May’s smile faded. 

“After losing my sister, and my niece and nephew, I made a deal to give my last surviving niece 100 years of life.”

Her words were white noise, my gaze glued to my birthday presents. I couldn't call them human anymore. 

I couldn't call Wren human, when his face was so beautifully grotesque, painfully hypnotising. 

The monstrous things sticking from twin slits in his back were supposed to be wings, except they looked wrong, cruelly protruding from his exposed spine. Under the influence of alcohol earlier, the girl made me smile. 

Her wings, to me, looked like one of a real fairy. 

In reality, they were torn and shredded apart, bigger than the girl herself. 

When she dropped onto her stomach, she was dragged back to her feet, her knees buckling under the weight. Her tiara of flowers and bone looked pretty to me when I saw her on the stairs. 

Now, though, I could see the pearly white of a human child's skull forced onto her head, dead flowers threaded through cavernous, gaping eye sockets. 

The two of them were violently shoved into the empty pool. 

“Jude. Please demonstrate, sweetheart.”

Jude stood, pulling out a gun, and aiming it at the winged girl.

*BANG*. 

The girl’s body hit the tiles, her blood seeping across stained white. 

“Now, of course, our king did not give you life for free.” May continued. 

“The King demanded a debt, as well as two heirs to join him in his court once your hundred years were complete.” 

Her lips quirked into a smile. 

“The king is smart. If a child cannot be stolen from the human world, they can, however, be made, moulded and shaped from their human forms, skinned of their humanity through their suffering, leaving a hollowed out shell in the child's place.” She was speaking so casually, ignoring Wren’s whimpers.

“The conversion takes a while. 100 years to birth a fully blooded fae heir, who will lose their human memories, in preparation to join their new family.”

Jude shot Wren in the chest, his eyes empty.

This time, he dropped his weapon, using finger-guns instead. 

“Bang.” He deadpanned. 

Then the neck.

I watched Wren come back to life, and then die. 

Over and over again. 

I think at one point, he screamed and cried. 

But not now. 

He was their puppet on display, dancing for their entertainment. 

Half lidded eyes drowned in oblivion found mine, and I understood his hatred.

Before he was shot again.

Stabbed. 

Branded and burned, and ripped apart.

At some point, I screamed at them to stop. I couldn't breathe, slamming my hands over my ears and begging them.

Aunt May didn't listen, ordering for my hands to be tied down. 

“The King required two human sacrifices to suffer in your place.” She concluded. “For one hundred years.”

Aunt May’s smile was suddenly sad, and she lifted her glass in a toast. 

I was watching their blood trickle down each tile in the pool, like every death, every time they suffered, my body became progressively less human. 

I felt disgusting. I wasn't supposed to be alive. Every single year of my life, every breath I had taken, was stolen. 

Aunt May nodded at me, her lips forming a proud smile. She stood up, and was handed a sacrificial knife. 

Climbing into the swimming pool herself, she strode over to Wren. 

The boy slumped to the floor, trembling, his knees against his chest. 

Aunt May grabbed him by the hair, forcing his head up, and sliced the blade across his throat. 

His eyes flicked to me, and I swore he smiled. 

Spots of red dotted yellowing tiles, a river trickling under my aunt's heels.

1pp1wnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1pp1wnq/resentments_and_communication/,Resentments and communication,"Hello! I want advice or another perspective. Thanks in advance.

I have this friend that I’ve known for many years. We got close a few years ago. When I moved away, she continued to reach out almost everyday. Sometimes multiple times a day. My phone and notifications freak me out. It was way too much for me. I asked for her to please dial it back. This girl seems to have a lot of friends and she was just blast sending outfit try ons or coffee reviews like a blog. I really didn’t care to see them.

She agreed to not reach out as much, but continues. I ended up getting a flip phone to reduce the stress the notifications have on me also so Snapchat wasn’t an option. She knows I don’t want to talk very much. Continues to try to pry things out of me that I don’t want to talk about or sends me things I don’t care to talk about. I feel terribly because I love her a lot as a person but I do not have the capacity to talk as much as she wants and it’s causing me to really resent her and dread when she’ll text next. 

I know I’ll need to talk to her again about not reaching out so much but selfishly I’m hoping she understands my cold shoulder and stops trying. I need her to find a friend that has the same communication style and that’s not me. I don’t know how to say all of this in a kind way.

We have a special bond where we can talk about anything to each other. 

One day, we were going to go out for the night. You know, drinks, clubs, boys. He told me he had invited this guy who he was flirting with, who was his old roommate's ex-boyfriend. I was like ""okay, whatever"". I didn't know the guy, so I didn't get much into it. My friend was in an open relationship atm, but it was kind of a mess up situation between them. Full of jealousy, fight, which even got physical one time. The boy, who I will call Josh, lived really far from the city so he asked if he could sleep over. At the time, me and my friend were living together. Derek asked if Josh could sleep with me in my bed, because he didn't want his boyfriend to know that he brought Josh home. I said it was okay, even tho I didn't know Josh, I didn't think it was a big deal. Derek clearly told me I could hook up with Josh, if I wanted to, he wouldn't mind since nothing had ever happened between them. I must confess that when he said that, I thought it was really out putting and didn't think much of it. 

  
We go out, I meet Josh, and i thought he was nice and good looking, but I didn't think I was attracted to him. After a lot of drinks and two clubs, we go home. We hangout at home for a bit. I was hammered and went to bed and they stayed at the living room. I woke up after a while, not sure how long because i passed out, and went to the kitchen to get a cup of water. I see Josh laying on the floor, Derek had fixed a mattress on the floor for Josh. I felt bad because we had a deal that Josh was going to sleep with me in my bed. As he was awakened, I asked if he'd prefer sleeping in my bed, I wouldn't mind. So he went. He said he couldn't sleep, so I said it was ok for him to turn on the TV. He was watching a series, and it kinda got interesting so I was watching with him. Then I feel his feet touching mine under the blanket. Mind you, I was still drunk and kind horny tbh. Next thing I know, we were kissing and the rest you can imagine. After a couple of hours, he said he needed to go  go to work early, so walked him out and went back to sleep. 

  
Nest morning, my friend is already awakened, making coffee and we start to talk about last night, how fun it was and everything. And then I said I had hooked up with Josh. Like I said, I didn't think it was a big deal because he gave green light for it so while I was telling him what happened, I was smiling and relaxed. Until I noticed his face changing and he stormed out of the apartment. I stood there not knowing what had happened and tried to call him, but he didn't pick up. So i thought it was best to give him some space. 

After a couple of hours, he gets home and asks if we could talk. I said sure and had the feeling it was going to be a very disturbed conversation. And I was right. He started yelling at me saying I had no right to hook up with Josh because he was the one who invited him and he was planning to do it. I replied saying he said I could do it if I wanted to because he asked if he could sleep in my bed and probably that would happen anyway. He said he knew that he said that but he was expecting I was going to be a good friend and disregard that after the night we had, because I saw they were vibing. He couldn't understand why he slept in my bed when he had fixed a mattress for Josh at the living, he would've thought that was implied he didn't want Josh to sleep with me anymore.  I truly wasn't paying attention if he was vibing with the guy or not, I was drunk and having fun dancing. When I go out, I like to dance until my feet hurts. He he thought I was way out of line, and he was really mad at me and needed some space because he felt like he couldn't trust me anymore. 

I'm not sure if I was wrong. I followed the deal and asked if he  (Josh) wanted to sleep more comfortable. I didn't think I was going to have sex with him, it really just happened. I said I was sorry because he was feeling this way but I didn't think I was wrong and broke his trust.

1pp1uj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pp1uj0/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_a_guy_a_saw_casually/,I can't stop thinking about a guy a saw casually years ago.,"This absolutely sucks to write as I (27F) have a husband (41M) I adore and 3 small kids with him. We have a small acreage where I can have all the animals I want, a nice little house, we're financially comfortable, etc. but I can't stop thinking about a guy (29M) I saw casually in university.


It's been 8 years ish since I stopped seeing this guy and started dating my husband. If I'm honest, I have no regrets. I absolutely love my husband and our family but for some reason I can't get this other guy out of my head. This other guy texted me in maybe 2023 or 2024, I can't remember. Just to say hi and I think maybe he had intentions of asking me out but I was quite upfront about having a husband and kids and living quite far away from where we were from (and where he still lived). So was very much not interested but he offered to go get coffee and catch up if I ever went back to visit our home town. I don't think I would ever actually do it but it consumes my mind daily.

We had a strange relationship that never developed into anything serious or exclusive. I did spend a lot of nights at his place and him at mine. We only tried to be intimate once and it was truly the worst sexual experience of my life lol. He isn't super attractive and is slightly shorter than me (not a deal breaker for me or anything just saying it's weird I'm so attracted to him). For context I'm 5'11"" naturally thin and blonde with unique green eyes, face card, good body, etc. I don't have super high self esteem but I'm not stupid and know I'm objectively very attractive. So I have never had a problem getting dates with very attractive, successful guys (hence the husband and kids). 

What we did have was a lot of deep conversations and disagreements with a sort of sexy, passionate energy I can't quite describe or put my finger on. He was intellectually stimulating and a bit of an asshole. I got to talk about literature, philosophy, politics in a way I never could before. I had a rival, and a good one. I lost every time we played chess. It was amazing. We also ate a lot of takeout, drank homemade wine and watched stupid shows and anime. I tried to push the relationship to develop and that's when we parted ways the first time. He didn't want a serious relationship. We reconnected maybe 9 ish months later but only for a few weeks before I broke it off because I met my husband and really wanted to pursue things with him. This other guy seemed kind of crushed but didn't do much about it so I didn't think anything of it. 


Anyway, here we are years later. I have a full life and I can't stop thinking about him. What the hell is wrong with me? On paper he's not even someone I'd really want to be with but I feel like I'd sacrifice a lot just to spend some time with him. I know he likes me, he said it. Obviously he's thinking about me too or he wouldn't have texted me a few years ago. He's told me he's dreamt of me. I wish I could forget him. I wish he would get the hell out of my head and let me focus on my family. I would never cheat on my husband, I love him very deeply and would literally die before being disloyal. I want to be with my husband. Which is why I feel so guilty for even having these thoughts. 

What the hell do I do here? How do I make this stop? I want to move on with my life and stop replaying things that happened with a guy I dated when I was 17-18. Am I condemned to thinking about him for the rest of my life? 




TL;DR
I can't get a guy out of my head that I dated when I was young. I'm happily married with kids and a good life but I'm constantly tormented by thoughts of this other guy. Help me. ",0,1765990994.0,relationships,23,0.18,False
1pp1twj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp1twj,Diai-Up Dreams,"This moodboard captures a decade suspended between analogue habit and digital promise — a time when everything felt slightly rough around the edges, but deeply lived-in.

It opens in a 90s coffee shop: dim lighting, chipped mugs, conversations half-heard over indie rock leaking from tired speakers. Outside, a UK intercity train rattles forward, vinyl seats and muted announcements carrying people between cities, ideas, and versions of themselves. The same sense of motion hums through early computer networking — bulky monitors, exposed cables, slow connections — the internet not yet polished, still experimental, still human.

Music anchors the atmosphere. Pavement’s slacker irony sits alongside Pearl Jam’s raw sincerity, with Nirvana looming in newsprint myth, and Oasis radiating swagger and contradiction. These aren’t just bands, but emotional reference points: sarcasm and sincerity coexisting without apology. A flannel shirt thrown over a graphic tee becomes uniform, not fashion — practical, unpretentious, expressive by accident.

Technology is tactile here. A Walkman clicks shut before a cassette spins. A Polaroid freezes moments imperfectly, colours bleeding, corners soft. A 90s internet café hums with keyboards and CRT monitors, strangers side by side, connected but still anonymous. A Super Mario game flashes primary colours and pixel logic — escapism that feels earned, not endless.

Television and humour sharpen the tone. My So-Called Life captures adolescent introspection without irony, while Chandler Bing’s goatee-era sarcasm reflects a generation using wit as armour. A slogan-heavy T-shirt distils the decade’s default language: dry, self-aware, emotionally evasive.

Threaded through it all is London in the 90s — Underground platforms, newspapers folded under arms, passengers half-present, half-lost in thought. Movement without urgency. Observation without performance.

Altogether, this moodboard is about liminal space: between youth and adulthood, offline and online, detachment and feeling. It’s a decade that didn’t try to brand itself — it just existed. And somehow, that’s what makes it linger.",2,1765990956.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

My partner and I are considering moving to the Minneapolis area from Austin, TX for a number of reasons. We have a trip planned for late February/early March to check out the city. I would love to hear your thoughts on places/specific areas around Minneapolis that we should check out. Specifically places that impact your day to day life that a tourist may not have much interest in. Our trip is aimed at getting an idea of what general life could look like in different areas so grocery stores (RIP HEB), bars, coffee shops, etc. We are mostly homebody but currently live 15 mins from downtown but still within the city of Austin and within walking distance to a few restaurants/bars which we love on the occasional weekend we go out. 

If you have any suggestions or recommendations, I’d love to hear them from you rather than the “Top 10 Places to go in Minneapolis” articles. Thanks!! :)

PS. We do anticipate potentially less than desirable weather during our trip. That is part of the reason we booked it then. We know summer is wonderful but want to test if we could handle the winter weather!",0,1765990926.0,Minneapolis,10,0.35,False

So I’ve been noticing something lately, especially online and in gyms:

Everything is suddenly **“high protein.”**  
Protein coffee. Protein cereal. Protein cookies. Protein ice cream.

And the message is always the same:

>

But honestly… I’m seeing more people struggle than succeed.

I recently met a woman who was eating around **170g protein daily** — mostly shakes, bars, and packaged snacks. Calories were sky-high, energy was low, digestion was bad, and her weight hadn’t moved in months.

That story doesn’t feel rare anymore.

Here’s what I think people aren’t being told:

• Most adults don’t actually need 150g of protein  
• “High-protein” snacks are usually ultra-processed and calorie-dense  
• Protein doesn’t burn fat by itself — calorie balance still matters  
• Eating protein alone won’t build muscle without proper training  
• Cutting carbs too aggressively often leads to fatigue and cravings

It feels like the diet industry just rebranded junk food by adding protein powder and calling it “healthy.”

What I’ve seen work better (for normal people, not bodybuilders):

– Whole protein foods (eggs, chicken, yogurt, beans)  
– Balanced meals with carbs and fats  
– Strength training a few times per week  
– A calorie intake that’s actually sustainable

I’m not anti-protein. I just think **protein has turned into a religion instead of a tool.**

Curious what others think.

Has high-protein dieting actually helped you?  
Or did it just make things more confusing and expensive?

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Huge lover of music here, primarily hip hop, but also pop, R&B, and Lo-Fi hip hop/jazz.

I would really love to build a community of people in the Orange County area who would have some interest in doing the same. We could choose an album to listen to and then meet up at a coffee shop to just have a hangout and talk about the music.



My music taste can get pretty eclectic (especially my hop hop taste), so I will name a couple artists: Conway, Rome Streetz, Freddie Gibbs, Joey Badass, (old) Logic, Coast Contra, just to name a few! But also, I am a fan of some more mainstream stuff such as certain Taylor Swift albums, Olivia Rodrigo, Adele.

1pp1pg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FFCFamilyChiro/comments/1pp1pg2/supporting_your_wellness_and_alignment_during_the/,Supporting Your Wellness and Alignment During the Holiday Season,"The holiday season is often described as the most wonderful time of year, filled with gatherings, traditions, and a busy schedule of events. While these moments bring joy, they also introduce unique changes to our daily rhythms. From long hours spent traveling and shopping to the physical demands of decorating and hosting, our bodies are often pushed into new patterns of movement and posture. Staying mindful of how we support our physical selves during this time allows us to engage more fully with our loved ones and the activities we enjoy.

Prioritizing wellness and body awareness during the festivities is a proactive way to navigate the season with ease. By focusing on gentle habits and mindful movement, you can support your overall function and maintain a sense of balance amidst the holiday hustle.

# Why This Topic Matters

The shift in our daily routine during December can have a significant impact on how we feel. Many holiday activities involve repetitive motions or prolonged positions that differ from our usual work or home life. Think about the afternoon spent hunched over wrapping gifts, the long drives to visit family, or the extra time spent standing while preparing holiday meals. These activities require our bodies to adapt to different physical stresses.

When we talk about wellness, we are often talking about how well our bodies can process and adapt to these daily environmental demands. Supporting the nervous system is a key part of this adaptation. The nervous system acts as the primary communication highway for the body, and keeping this system functioning smoothly helps us stay connected to our physical needs. By maintaining good alignment and choosing habits that support physical ease, we allow our bodies to better manage the busy nature of the season.

# Educational Insight: Lifestyle and Function

During the holidays, it is easy to let self care habits slide. However, the way we move, sit, and even breathe influences our overall sense of well being. Alignment is not just about standing up straight for a photo; it is about how we carry ourselves through every task. When we focus on posture and mobility, we are essentially giving our bodies the space they need to function optimally.

A wellness focused lifestyle during the winter months involves more than just a single choice. It is a collection of small, intentional actions that prioritize the body’s natural ability to maintain balance. Whether you are navigating a busy shopping center in Surrey or heading to a festive dinner in Langley, being aware of your physical alignment can help you feel more grounded and present.

Understanding that the nervous system coordinates every function in the body allows us to see why physical alignment is so vital. When we support the spine and the surrounding structures, we are essentially supporting the pathway through which our body understands and interacts with the world. During a high energy season like the holidays, keeping those pathways clear through mindful movement and professional support is a cornerstone of a holistic lifestyle.

# Actionable Tips for Holiday Alignment

Supporting your body during the holidays does not have to be complicated. Incorporating simple, actionable strategies into your day can make a significant difference in your overall comfort and mobility.

**1. Mindful Gift Wrapping Stations** Wrapping presents often leads to hours of sitting on the floor or leaning over a low coffee table. This can create unnecessary strain on the body. Instead, try setting up a wrapping station at a waist high counter or table. This allows you to stand or sit in a more neutral position. Remember to take a break every twenty minutes to stretch your arms and roll your shoulders to maintain mobility.

**2. Strategic Travel Habits** If your holiday plans involve long periods of sitting in a car or on a plane, movement is your best friend. For road trips, plan to stop every ninety minutes to walk and stretch for five minutes. While seated, you can perform small movements like ankle circles or gentle neck tilts to keep your body engaged. Proper lower back support, such as a rolled up towel placed at the small of your back, can also help maintain natural curves during long hauls.

**3. Ergonomic Decorating and Lifting** Lifting heavy boxes of decorations or reaching for the top of the tree requires conscious movement. Always remember to bend at the knees and hips rather than the waist when picking up heavy items. When reaching upward, use a sturdy step stool instead of overextending your arms and neck. Keeping items close to your body while carrying them helps maintain your center of gravity and supports better alignment.

**4. Prioritize Hydration and Mindful Breaks** With the abundance of holiday treats and seasonal beverages, it is easy to forget about water. Staying hydrated supports the soft tissues of the body and overall systemic function. Additionally, the holidays can be sensory overload. Set aside ten minutes a day for quiet reflection or deep breathing. This simple habit supports the nervous system by encouraging a transition from a busy, high energy state to one of calm and recovery.

**5. Footwear Awareness for Festive Events** Holiday parties often involve standing for long periods, sometimes in footwear that doesn't offer much support. If you know you will be on your feet, choose shoes that provide a stable base. If you prefer to wear dress shoes for an event, consider bringing a pair of supportive walking shoes for the commute or the cleanup afterward to give your foundation a rest.

# How Chiropractic Fits Into Your Holiday Routine

Many people find that the holidays are an ideal time to check in with their wellness providers. At FFC, we use gentle, neurologically focused chiropractic techniques to help support overall function and awareness of the body. By focusing on the relationship between the spine and the nervous system, we help individuals maintain a foundation of wellness.

Chiropractic care is a non invasive, gentle approach that fits naturally into a healthy lifestyle. Rather than focusing on a specific issue, it looks at the body as a whole, integrated system. Many people choose ongoing chiropractic care as part of their wellness lifestyle to help them stay mobile and connected to their bodies throughout the changing seasons. As you navigate the demands of December, gentle adjustments can be a supportive tool in your self care toolkit, helping you stay aligned with your health goals.

# Supporting Your Journey in Surrey and Langley

Wellness is a year round commitment, but the holidays offer a unique opportunity to practice mindfulness and body awareness. By staying proactive with your movement and posture, you can enjoy the festivities while feeling your best. Whether you are a busy parent, a frequent traveler, or someone who simply loves the holiday season, taking time to support your physical function is a gift to yourself.

\- Living in LA I have realized I hate not being able to find parking. I'd love to be able to go out to eat or run errands without having to look up the parking situation.

My phone lit up the room—3:00 a.m.

Too early for morning.

Too late for night.

I lay there, listening to the house breathe. No footsteps. No voices. Everyone else should’ve been asleep. I set the phone down and rolled onto my side, forcing my eyes closed.

Just as I started to drift—

An alarm went off.

Not mine.

Uncle Ben’s.

It echoed down the hallway—sharp, mechanical, impossible to ignore. My heart was already pounding as I sat up. Something about the sound felt wrong, like it wasn’t meant to wake someone… but summon them.

I pulled on my clothes and headed for the kitchen.

The coffee maker was already running.

Uncle Ben stood at the counter, yawning. Dad was at the table, fully dressed, staring into his cup like he hadn’t slept at all.

“You ready?” Uncle Ben asked. “We head out in fifteen.”

I nodded and grabbed my bags, carrying them out to his truck. The morning air was cold and damp, the kind that clung to your skin. When I reached for the rifle case, my hand hesitated.

Dad’s words came back to me.

“Guns end heartbeats—but some things don’t live in the body”

My brother Nick used to go hunting.

Used to.

He’d died in a car crash three years ago. After that, the woods became something we didn’t talk about. I slid the case into the truck anyway.

We climbed in.

“We’re gonna be on the road for a few hours,” Dad said. “Get some sleep. Might be the last you get for the next thirty-six hours”

I didn’t ask what he meant. I was too tired to care.

I woke to the sound of gravel crunching beneath the tires.

We were nearing the woods—I knew it before I saw the sign.

HALLOW RIDGE

The same town where Nick crashed his car three years ago. The police said he lost control and went off the ridge. They found the car.

They never found him.

I wondered if that was why we hunted here.

To look for him.

Or to visit what passed for his grave.

Before we passed through town, Dad spoke again.

“You don’t sleep in the woods,” he said. His voice was firm. “Not even for a minute.”

“What if we’re exhausted and someone else is awake?” I asked.

He didn’t answer.

“We’ll sleep when we get back to town,” Uncle Ben said. “Got it?”

“Yeah,” I muttered, not understanding why it mattered so much.

“One more thing,” Dad said. His tone sharpened. “You never go anywhere without your shovel.”

I frowned but didn’t argue.

As we turned onto the dirt track, a weathered sign passed by the headlights:

NO TRESPASSING

ABSOLUTELY NO CAMPING

No one commented.

The road ended deep in the trees. We unloaded our gear in silence. Both Dad and Uncle Ben looked worn down—like men carrying something heavy for far too long. I’d never seen them like this.

That’s when I saw it.

A figure stood at the edge of the treeline.

It didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

Just stared.

At first, I thought it was one of them—some kind of joke—but then I realized it wasn’t anyone I knew.

It was tall. Too tall. And where its face should’ve been, there was only darkness.

I stumbled back. “Dad… what is that?”

His hand clamped onto my shoulder.

“Stay calm,” he said quietly. “Don’t look away. Don’t blink.”

My lungs burned. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but I couldn’t. Something about it felt… familiar. Like it belonged here. Like it had been waiting.

Uncle Ben whispered, almost to himself

1pp1odb,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1pp1odb/feeling_empowered/,Feeling Empowered!,"When I started fasting, I weighed 226lbs and 5'10"". My goal weight is 165lbs, what I weighed before having my baby ask those years ago. I had a huge gut in front of me, which restricted my breathing, and caused a lot of heartburn. I take an acid reducer and was eating tums almost every day, often more than once a day. I was having trouble getting my socks and shoes on, I couldn't manage simple exercises, and working full time as a nurse in a care home was getting difficult. I was binge eating choc bars and chips every night in bed. I asked my doctor for help and was honest. He switched me from my previous adhd med to one called vyvanse, which is used to control binge eating. It helps but doesn't prevent binging altogether for me. He also suggested IF and showed me a book that helped one of his other patients with calorie restrictions every other day. I got the book, got rid of the treats, and started. 

Restricting calories every other day was a great start. I could do one day of being hungry, followed by one day off eating normally,  and it worked to help me lose weight. 

The weight loss was dramatic to start with, simply because I was no longer consuming 200-500 in chocolates every night, and no longer consuming salty chips at night(water retention).

Then I started reading about the various IF time frames, autophagy, and tried out 18:6, skipping breakfast, sometimes having breakfast for lunch. I found it feels really good to follow this time frame. On my days off, I'll even do 20:4, but I find I get very light headed and dizzy. 

Then added in caloric restrictions to limit my binge eating during that 6h time frame. 

Added in chewing sugarless gum at night to help with food cravings while in bed because eating choc bars and chips at night in bed was my weight gain, and it's hard to resist some nights, but if I'm chewing gum(even long after it's lost its flavor) then I'm chewing something other than bad snacks. 

Lots of water during the day, black coffee, zero Gatorade that I water down half and half because I like it better that way. I recently added in jasmine green tea, which was yummy.

I've lost 30lbs before Christmas season started!

I've been having difficulty with ALL. THE. TREATS. during Christmas season, so I'm cutting myself some slack and will be happy to simply keep the 30lbs off until Christmas is over. 

Well, today I weighed in at 189!! Down 37lbs today!! I'm thrilled! I've cracked 190 today. Even if I go up a pound or two, I'm still on the right track.

I just wanted to share my story and progress with others who get it! My friends and family are always happy for me, but this group GETS IT!

\- A place that has a lot of other people in their 30's would be ideal!

\- I have a senior dog and cats so I'm home often. My dog can't walk too long but I do like taking her on scenic walks! (As in we walk for a bit and then I carry her for the rest of the walk haha)

\- One of the main factors for picking the PNW is the nature. Even as a kid all I've wanted was to live somewhere surrounded by trees!

\- Living in LA I have realized I hate not being able to find parking. I'd love to be able to go out to eat or run errands without having to look up the parking situation.",0,1765990400.0,PacificNorthwest,28,0.43,False

The first Veloce Club trip abroad was always going to be special — but *Wheels & Waffles: A Ghent Tour* exceeded every expectation.

Designed specifically for riders who had never ridden overseas (or had very little experience of doing so), the weekend brought together **10 riders** for three days of sunshine, superb roads, gentle challenges, and brilliant company.

# Day One – From Terminals to Trappist Territory

We met early on Friday morning at **Le Shuttle**, where introductions were made, nerves were settled, and a full ride brief was delivered. Alongside route planning and group riding expectations, there was also a very real discussion about the *nightmare potential* of passport control — including the possibility of being split across different trains.

Naturally… that’s exactly what happened.

A few of us — including me as the ride leader — were pulled aside for a search and pushed onto a slightly later train. Credit to the rest of the group, who calmly waited on the French side until we regrouped, spirits still high.

Once together, we headed straight for the **French country roads**, easing into the ride through **Guînes, Watten, and Cassel**, before crossing into Belgium and stopping in **Poperinge** for a well-earned coffee.

From there, the route flowed through **Roeselare** and **Tielt**, before a fuel stop just four miles from the hotel introduced our first real challenge of the weekend.

And then... Jed’s bike refused to start.

After an hour of troubleshooting, the decision was made to get the group to the hotel — with **James and Matt pushing Jed’s bike the last stretch**, aka London thief-style. A new skill learned, and plenty of laughs earned.

We rolled into the underground parking at the **Ibis Hotel**, checked in, showered, and regrouped in the bar for our **first Belgian beer** — followed by food and the kind of conversation that only comes after a full day on the road.

# Day Two – Detours, Delays, and a Surprise Reunion

Saturday morning began with a 9am briefing, but Jed was forced to sit this one out initially while sourcing a new battery.

The planned **99-mile route** quickly threw us a curveball: within minutes of hitting the countryside, roads were closed with *no diversions*. A quick re-route on the fly and we were back underway, exactly the kind of real-world riding experience the trip was designed to provide.

After 90 minutes, we stopped for coffee, then continued on to **lunch in Wargem**. As we pulled up, a single bike appeared in the distance.

It was Jed!! :)

Battery replaced, determination intact, he’d tracked us down and joined the group — a moment that summed up the spirit of the weekend perfectly (and a great opportunity for a group photo).

Following lunch, the group collectively decided to head back toward **Ghent**, giving everyone the chance to explore the city. An ad-hoc route was created, fuel was topped up, and we returned to the hotel mid-afternoon.

The evening was spent exploring Ghent in smaller groups before reconvening at a fantastic local Belgian bar for beers and food. Some of the group carried on to a late jazz bar, others opted for an early night — everyone exactly where they wanted to be.

# Day Three – History, Coffee, and the Journey Home

Sunday’s ride brief wrapped up the weekend, and we rolled out at 9:30am onto quiet country roads. A coffee stop in **Ypres** included a ride through the iconic **Menin Gate**, a powerful and memorable moment to share as a group.

From Ypres, the final leg required a motorway stretch — the last 50 minutes back to **Le Shuttle**. On arrival, there were handshakes, hugs, and goodbyes as riders caught different trains home.

# A Trip to Remember

As **Veloce Club’s first ever away trip**, *Wheels & Waffles: A Ghent Tour* set the bar incredibly high. Amazing weather, well-chosen roads, small challenges overcome together — and most importantly, a group of genuinely brilliant people.

The confidence gained by riders new to overseas travel was clear, and the sense of camaraderie even clearer.

The bar has been raised — but we’re already looking ahead.

# Eden Renewed

**The following is an excerpt from a Press Packet that was discovered in \[LOCATION REDACTED\] on \[Date Redacted\]:** 

*Eden Renewed Mississippi is a therapeutic group home for youth in Child Protective Custody.*

*Founded in 1865 by Irma Ruth Lawson as Christ's Love Home for Orphans, the original home was opened on her 167 Acre plantation. The children lived in comfort inside the 'Big House' and, according to our records, were either adopted or lingered to help old Miss Lawson work her land. A  true reconstruction success story!*

*Of course, nowadays, while we don't have a mansion, we have several homes on campus where our youth live, work, and play with a trauma-informed staff that includes Resident Assistants, an Independence Coach, and an entire Clinic of Mental Health professionals with myriad credentials. Some of our success is made possible by state funding. However, we here at Eden Renewed would not be able to sustain our operations were it not for the generous community, volunteers, and our various stakeholders.* 

*Do you feel the Lord leading you to help? Do you want to bring love and joy into the lives of children battered and beaten by the world? Keep reading to find out how you can make a difference, or go to ww-*

# Chicxulub 

The Sun fell over the blurry horizon. The early evening sky, thick brush strokes of purples, oranges, light and dark blues. Even with the sun low, the air was thick and hot in my lungs with every slow breath I took, lying on my back. The symphony of nature permeated the atmosphere; warbling cicadas, the size of dinner plates, a chorus in time with the trumpeting in the emerald valley below. A cool breeze cut through the tall grass, carrying relief and the scent of unfamiliar flora. Peaceful evenings on my perch from the high cliff were a treat I rarely got to enjoy because I could never remember how to get there.  

Gradually, the scene became brighter, the watercolor above slowly eroding into white-hot light. The breeze became more intense, the world silent, as something oblong and jagged broke through the clouds. The silence was short-lived as the symphony fell out of sync; the cries grew more intense, the trumpeting spiraling into turmoil. A bassline roar, like an engine or a massive fire, heralded a blistering wind as the ground began to shake.  

I stood awkwardly, catching my balance with a wet crunch. In the all-exposing light, I could see eggs, huge eggs. I lifted my hand, bloodied with thick shards of shell, my arm, torso, and neck splattered with viscous orange yolk. My heart plummeted into my stomach, and my breathing became shallower. In the jungles, I heard otherworldly cries of panic, and the sound of drums pounding chaotically as huge bodies stampeded, trampled, and clamored to find safety.   

My body felt electric, my head swimming with dread as I turned to run. To where, I had no clue, but my feet never left the ground as I saw a huge, pebbled head emerge into the flooding light. A Tyrannosaur, pointed teeth, yellow and black, the mother of the nest, bounded into the clearing. Her steps were cautious as even she was prone to the quaking ground beneath her. She didn’t seem to notice me; her neck was craned, staring into our shared doom. In this moment, I felt a strange sense of comfort. My heart rate slowed with my breathing, and she let her gaze fall to me. Even from far away, I could see her red avian eyes drip with thick, wet tears.  

I opened my mouth to say something. I lost my words as, all at once, my world shook violently and was swallowed up in silent darkness. I was falling. The air left my lungs. In only a moment, my body finally collided with my bed, and I found myself gasping for air. It was five minutes before my alarm.  

# Fellow Travellers

""Tyler.""

My therapist, Annie, was standing in the hallway by her office door. She was a tall woman in her mid-30s with olive skin and a keen eye for flannel button-downs. We shared warm smiles as I moved into the purple room with its plush gray couch and overstuffed bookshelf. She closed the door and sat on her leather easy chair while I sank into the fat cushions. ""How's your week?""

“It's good,” I replied earnestly. 

“Things going well at the Clinic? This is your. . . fourth week?”  

 “I think I’m adjusting well to everything,” I said, running my fingers along one of the corduroy pillows absentmindedly. I paused, thinking of my trajectory. “I will say. . . I’m going home exhausted but in a different way than before.” 

She maintained her warmth. “Well, you’re face-to-face with kids who carry a lot of complex traumas,” she said, taking a sip from her coffee mug. “It’s a complex exhaustion.” 

“For sure.” I responded quickly, “I thought I was a therapist when I was bartending full-time. But this is a whole new ball game.” 

“But you had to know it would be.” 

“I did. And I love it. I’m just glad I have you as a sounding board.”  

Annie took another sip, “Can you tell me a time this week that brought some feelings out of you?” 

I bit my lip, finding my words, ""Well...I have something to tell you that goes beyond HIPPA.""

She cocked an eyebrow, ""Okay.""

I took a deep breath, ""So you know The Caesarians?""

""Yes, I think I saw something about them on the news the other night.""

""Yeah, they're all over it. Well, CPS put all their kids in our care at the group home.""

Annie made a sympathetic face.

""I mean, I can't blame them for having trouble, you know, adjusting to the outside world. *Especially* after their family just up and disappeared, but. . ."" I trailed off, shaking my head. Everything I had experienced with those kids up to that point felt like a caged lion, gnashing against the bars of my brain, just trying to get out.

Annie could see my struggle, ""Tell me about one of them.""

""There's this one kid, Jeremiah- he's only 12, I think. Anyway, he came into my office yesterday sobbing. I saw blood stains on his pants around the crotch. Of course, I immediately called a nurse to check on him, patch him up, you know, and afterwards I was able to calm him down and talk to him."" I was already feeling drained remembering it.

""So he hurt himself?""

I nodded my head silently, ""They have this thing, where if one of the boys lusts after one of their 'sisters,' the girls in the group, they have to bleed the sin out. But that's not why he was crying.""

Annie leaned in now, nodding her head.

“His mom told him she feels his emotions and pain. Like some kind of psychic link.” 

“The *mom* feels the *boy’s* pain?” 

“Yes, and this kid is absolutely convinced of it. He slips into crisis every time he even feels slightly dysregulated because he thinks his mom is being forced to feel it too.” My foot tapped the floor of its own volition making soft rhythmic thumps.  

Annie softened again, “I know you, Tyler. In this situation, and correct me if I’m wrong, you feel torn because you want to build that trust, but you're also not a deprogrammer?” 

I swallowed, trying to shrink the lump in my throat, ""There's just so much to deprogram. The psychic link, the commandments, The Verdant One-""

""Verdant One?""

""It's their deity. I don't know much about it. The only thing they haven't done yet is proselytize. But it hasn't been a week yet."" I took a sharp breath and began to feel better again.

Annie and I shared a moment of silent understanding before she finally spoke, ""So it hasn't been a good week."" She cracked a smile and I couldn't resist a laugh.

""No, no it hasn't. And to top it all off, I had the dream again last night.""

She kept her smile, ""You're getting existential again.""

""Can you blame me? Look at the world, shit, look in our back yard! I'm well aware that we live on borrowed time but. . . I don't know. I wish I could feel comfortable with the fact that in the blink of an eye, this could all be gone.""

""And who's in control of that?""

""I wish I knew.""

# New Trees

Esther slowly opened her eyes, her hair matted against the cold window of the charter bus. The low rumble of the engine had lulled her to sleep and she sat up quickly to ensure it didn't lull her again. She glanced over to see her little sister Mary curled up in her seat sleeping with her mouth open. When Esther had fallen asleep, the sun was still out and they were still in the desert close to home. 

Now it was night time and all she could see out the window were big trees like a tunnel in the indirect glow from the headlights. She tried to fix her eyes on each one passing by. She didn't recognize them. They were much bigger than the few she saw back home. From what she could tell, they had lots of green leaves and weird gray fuzzies hanging off of every branch, like little ghosts. She leaned away, feeling uneasy now. 

When she felt uneasy, she would usually talk to her Mama. Her Mama always knew how to make her feel better. Sometimes she would give a big hug, and sometimes she would read a story from Papa's book. She felt like he was always too busy with her other brothers and sisters to pay attention, but she wanted him to. And now they were all gone. To where, she didn't know. None of their grown-up trips ever lasted this long. 

Or maybe they found The Verdant One. But if they did then surely they'd be back for their children. Papa always told her that the children are the ones The Verdant One seeks the most. Either way, among the many things that were making her sad, she was just five days away from her 13th birthday. She thought about the celebration she would miss. The gifts, the pretty dress, and most of all the chance to go into Papa's mansion. She would finally get to see what it was like in there. She would be alone with him, and she would finally receive her assignment from The Verdant One. Some girls, like her Mama, were assigned to be his wife. Others got to stay in his house and never had to leave. 

This was what Esther wanted more than anything. To live in Papa's house forever and learn his secret teachings. But these hopes sank away with her heart as the bus began to slow down. She craned her neck over the seat in front of her to see a huge wrought iron gate. A man dressed in black and blue was making motions with his hands while the gate opened slowly. From the back of the bus she heard a brother say ""we're here."" Another child somewhere on the bus began to cry. Mary began to stir. 

Esther petted her sister's hair gently as the young girl finally opened her eyes. Gently she said, ""Wake up, Mary, we're here.""

Mary groaned, ""Where are we?""

""I don't know.""

""Why is there crying?""

""They miss their mama, and Papa."" Esther squeezed Mary's shoulder as the little girl began looking around.

""I miss them too.""Mary said, starting to tear up.

""I know, but we're going to be strong for them."" Esther said pulling her into an embrace. Holding her there while she felt hot silent tears stain her shirt. 

The bus finally stopped and with a hiss the doors opened. After a moment, a small woman with a face stretched back like a cat stepped up beside the driver. ""Welcome to Eden Renewed, Children.""",1,1765990367.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pp1jnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fieldnotesofbecoming/comments/1pp1jnb/life_playing_hard_to_get/,Life Playing Hard to Get:,"[“Still breathing. Still chasing the almost.” Oriah Versewell](https://preview.redd.it/k2rivfvams7g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=23da0462032e28417296fbd3c2e3e3eee457f0c4)

I need an outlet—  
not a sermon, not a medal—  
just somewhere the pressure can go  
without taking my hands hostage.

Because aggression stored up  
isn’t a dragon, it’s a jar—  
lid cranked down by ghosts,  
glass sweating in my palm  
till everything I touch  
tastes like pennies and weather.

I’m still here.  
No fireworks.  
No “vibing.”  
Just lungs doing their shift-work  
in the back room of my ribs—

and some part of me  
still tilting toward the world  
like it might tilt back.

This last year was the death of me  
in installments—  
little receipts, daily,  
ink that wouldn’t dry.

No choir.  
No clean ending.  
Just morning after morning  
my name feeling borrowed,  
the mirror a stranger  
holding my face up by the corners.

And life—  
life kept dropping hints  
like it wanted me desperate:  
a warm square of sun on the floor,  
a song snagging on my sleeve,  
a stranger laughing  
like a door left open.

I hate how much I want it.  
I hate how much it works.

Still—  
I’ve been clawing.

Through the unknown.  
Through mud with opinions.  
Through that heavy ordinary force  
that drags your plans low  
and calls it “practical.”

One more time, I said—  
a match in a wet alley,  
an engine that hates the cold  
but coughs awake anyway,  
shoes that keep walking  
because stopping  
is a prayer I don’t trust yet.

I’m trying to grip things  
I’ve never held before:  
steady,  
quiet,  
a future that doesn’t flinch  
when I reach for it—

and maybe that’s the tell:  
I keep reaching  
like life is playing hard to get,  
like it’s been glancing back  
from across the room of days,  
and I’m acting casual  
while my whole nervous system  
takes attendance.

Right now  
I don’t feel like I deserve  
what I’m aiming at.

But worthiness shows up late—  
coffee in hand—  
after the storm already did  
what storms do.

When I get there  
I’ll recognize myself again.

And I’ll look back  
and see the suffering wasn’t prophecy—  
it was the bill—  
paid in bruises and breath,  
paid by that stubborn little yes  
flickering in the dark  
like a roadside sign  
I kept checking  
even when it hurt.

The closest thing I’ve got  
to a magic wand  
is a magic mind,  
and I finally feel alive—

a straight-faced joke  
the universe tells  
without blinking—

because after everything  
I still get dizzy  
over the world offering itself  
in small, unbearable doses:  
steam from a cup,  
rain on asphalt,  
the clean click of a door  
closing on a bad hour.

This year tested me  
in languages I didn’t know I spoke:  
silence,  
absence,  
waiting so long  
the minutes grew teeth.

I still get triggered—  
the flare, the heat,  
the little riot in the ribs  
looking for a law to break—

but I’m learning the release  
in three hard steps:

anger into sorrow,  
sorrow into breath,  
breath into nothing—

not numb,  
not erased—

emptied,  
like a storm spending itself  
over open water  
where nobody has to drown  
for the sky to be done.

So yes—  
I still burn.

But I don’t build a house  
inside the fire anymore.

I’m still here.  
Not shining. Not finished.  
Just breathing—

and with a ridiculous, stubborn tenderness  
I keep falling—quietly, repeatedly—  
for life itself,  
for the way it almost loves you back  
when you don’t blink,  
for the way it leaves the light on  
just long enough  
to make you believe  
you can walk toward it again.

**SCRIPT:** 



*(SFX: Gentle winds, and faint wind chimes.)*

(Humming softly to herself. Some lonely, bittersweet melody.)

Serendipity. That’s how you pronounce the word. Se-ren-di-pity.

You were very close, my sweet. You’ve made such good progress. I’m proud of you. (Pecking his forehead)

Yes, I am. You’re bright. Full of curiosity and warmth. I named you well, when I named you my Sunshine. (A tiny laugh)

I think I’d have really liked it if we went to the same school. Yeah, it- it would’ve been nice. But I don’t think I’d have been able to focus on my studies much with you around.

(Smiling) Don’t make me say it. Don’t you already know?

(A longer pause)

Hm? You want to know what that word means? “Serendipity”?

Let’s see. It means a series of happy accidents. Good things happening to you, because the universe has secretly conspired to help you.

Has it ever happened to me? Oh, sure it has. (Sighing) Only recently.

*(SFX: Affectionately playing with his hair)*

Do you want to continue reading the story?

No? Well then, would you like me to read it to you?

Okay.

(Reading from the page)

It was by a stroke of serendipity, that the boy found himself working in the household of the girl he liked. She was a vampire, as you know, and society wouldn’t let them be together. But it didn’t matter. He was happy, to simply be around her. To serve her breakfast, arrange her dresses, brush her long blonde hair in the morning and before bed, and let her feed from him in secret, when no one was watching. As for the vampire-

*(Continuing to brush his hair)*

She’d already decided he was going to be hers. It was she who’d convinced her parents to take him in. She, who’d schemed and plotted so the boy would end up as *her* personal butler. And she made sure he’d spend most of his waking hours with her each day. It was a pity humans needed to sleep, else she’d not let him do that either. After all, (sighing softly) she loved the boy. She didn’t care if it was wrong or right. She just....did.

(Cuddling up to her Sunshine) Yeah. Some guys do get all the luck in the world. (Whispering softly) But so do some girls.

(A longer pause)

What happened after that? Well....

As the months passed, the two of them only grew closer. Falling in love. But her repeated feedings had left the boy somewhat weak, and anaemic. He protested it was fine, but seeing her darling that way tugged at her heartstrings. So, for his sake, she decided she’d try to survive on blood from animals as often as she could. Drinking another human’s blood felt like cheating. It was silly, but love often is.

And so she went hunting in the forest one evening. Much to her indignation and worrying, the boy tagged along and wouldn’t take no for an answer.

They spent all night hunting wild animals- foxes, deer, elks, and the like. It was pointless, of course. Vampires can only drink blood from humans, as she found out. What a colossal waste of a perfectly good night, she sighed, as they prepared to return home. But little did the two of them know, they weren’t the only ones hunting in the forest.

A group of vampire hunters, waiting in the shadows the entire time, suddenly set upon them. And they wouldn’t listen. The vampire watched with horror as they drew their weapons. She didn’t understand. She’d never hunted humans her entire life. She’d only ever had fangs for her darling. Why, then? Why would the hunters not listen to their pleas?

Was being born with red eyes, enough reason for her to not be allowed to live?

(Frowning, as if she’s having a dull ache that won’t go away)

She pleaded with the boy to get away. She had to save him. She couldn’t let him get hurt. But her butler wouldn’t leave. He stood between her and the hunters, yelling at her to run. The hunters didn’t want to strike down one of their own race, but the boy wouldn’t move. In the heat of the scuffle, one hunter’s blade struck truer than he’d intended. And that....

That was it.

(A long pause)

The vampire watched, helplessly, as her darling bled out on the ground. His eyes, which only a few moments ago had sparked with some inane joke she couldn’t remember, were now cold and dead. And, in that moment, something snapped.

She saw red. She’d never needed to fight before. Her dormant powers awakened, and she felt an insatiable thirst for blood. But not to drink. She slaughtered every last one of the hunters. When her vision returned to normal, she found all of them dead, and herself covered in scarlet. But it was too late.

She desperately tried to revive him, tried to turn him, but nothing worked. No force in this world can bring back a human after they’re dead. All you can do for them, is bury them.

But you know something, Sunshine?

The vampire found blood rolling down her cheeks, as she cradled his head. She was crying tears of blood. And it’s said, where her tears touched the ground, the first hibiscus flowers bloomed. Blood-red, beautiful. And these flowers would remind her of him. Even if she was cursed to exist forever, she’d never forget. That brief stretch of time in her life, (sighing softly), when she’d truly lived.

*(Pausing, still playing with the listener’s hair)*

This used to be one of my favourite stories growing up, you know? It’s the first one I read which made me realise, not all stories have happy endings.

Yeah. To this day, hibiscus flowers make me depressed whenever I spy one. We vampires seem to have a strange relationship with flowers. They are common in our traditions and folklore. But they probably shouldn’t be. They’re everything we’re not- fleeting, fragile, soft. Alive.

(Smiling, faintly amused) Yes. We vampires also seem fond of servants. So often, we like to take the humans we fancy and make them our butlers and maids. But can you really blame me? You make quite the coffee.

Well, your coffee is growing on me. I don’t need to eat or drink the way humans do, but I still like to. It helps me feel like I’m still connected to my old way of life.

Yes.

Hey. Sunshine. You don’t mind being my butler, right?

Really?

(Kissing him, smiling) I’m happy to hear that.

(Sighing softly, teasing) I mean, I wanted to give you *something* to do after....you know. When you so bravely took a bullet for me, and- (smile dimming)- lost a kidney.

I’m afraid it’s the end of your vampire hunting career. You’re not as agile as before, and your instincts have dulled from spending so much time trapped in the arms of the very creature you’re supposed to kill. (Gently giggling)

Sorry about that, teddy bear. (Whispering up close) I most certainly am not. (Kissing him again)

You are so warm. So soft. So cute. So blushy. I adore you, sweetheart. And....I....(sighing with finality) I promise I’ll never let you get hurt again.

I know. You chose to do what you did, because you wanted to protect me. But that is the one freedom which I won’t give you. (Gentle, but firm) You’re not allowed to put yourself in danger anymore. Not for my sake, not for anyone’s. If something were to happen to you, I’d be shattered. Completely. So....the next time you’re about to do something stupid, think on that.

(Nuzzling her head under his chin) If you risk your life again, and end up surviving, then I’ll kill you myself. Understand?

(Staring into his eyes) Tell me you understand.

(A longer pause)

Good boy.

(Exhaling softly, slow and audible breathing)

You don’t need to worry about taking down any more evil bloodsuckers, alright?

Uh huh. Trust me. They’re all gone now. Morwena has been cleansed of rogue vampires. People aren’t deprived of their lives outside the rule of law anymore. And it’s all because of you. You made this a safe haven for humans once more. And you saved my life.

Yeah. I can’t die from bullets. But...you know....they still sting. So thanks for that.

(Nuzzling into him again, whispering) My hero.

(Blissful, lingering silence)

I always wanted to build a world where  humans and vampires can live with each other peacefully. It sounds laughable, I know. Impossible. But even if we can never be equals in society, I still want humans to have all the liberties vampires enjoy. I....I want you and your friends to be able to live, and live well.

(Laughing gently) No, I really *am* a vampire. You’d know. You’re my favourite blood bag.

Yes. You are my *only* blood bag, but I’m pretty sure I’d never want anybody else.

Because I’m in love with you. (Fondly) Stupid.

(They share a slow, romantic kiss)

You may be right, my darling. Perhaps I think and feel this way because I’ve not been a vampire for long. Part of me still feels human.

(Murmuring) I don’t want to lose that part. I....I’m scared of losing that part.

I never told you why I named you Sunshine, did I?

(A longer pause)

Something about you reminds me of a memory.

Yeah. If I close my eyes, I can....I can see them. The sunbeams. Swirling dust, in an attic full of old books. The sun is warm, and its light is gentle, and the afternoon- the afternoon is quiet and hazy. But I can still hear my brother playing the piano down below. The notes are faint. Sweet. And they drift up into the attic, swirling in the dappled sunlight, like motes of musical dust.

I did have a brother, yes. Older than me, kinder than me. And our parents were nice and loving. I knew of vampires, of course, but they always felt like creatures of legend. Our unseen overlords. Monsters that dwelled far, far away. Not in our tiny village behind the walls. My brother and I could have peacefully lived our lives without ever seeing them.

The universe had other plans. Or maybe it was just her. The woman who led them into our village, torched the place to the ground. Killed anything that resisted. Snuffed out life, and replaced it with the fires of burning houses. The woman who destroyed it all in one night. My mentor.

She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She seemed to glide over the earth instead of walk. Her armour shined like it was made of the moon, and everything about her disarmed you. I would never have known someone so alluring could be so cruel. And there she stood, surrounded by corpses and blood and cinder ash, gently holding my brother at her side. Looking at him with....(searching for words)

Well, it’d take me many years to fully understand that look in her eyes. (Softly) It’s the same way I look at you.

Smitten. Attached. *Possessive*, beyond all limits. The way only a vampire can be.

She took us into her world. One of endless luxury and power and revelry. Everything we could have ever wanted, was ours. Everything except the blue sky, because the sky was always cloudy and grey in her world. She separated the two of us. I was sent to live with one of her sisters, growing up alongside vampires. Had my own tutors and guards and attendants. As for my brother, she kept him all to herself. I could only see him once a week.

You know, Sunshine, my brother wasn’t like you. He wasn’t a vampire slayer. Someone used to fighting the world at every step. (Breathing heavily) But he was the bravest man I knew. He kept so much bottled up inside, carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, the whims of his Mistress, and never failed to smile when he saw me. Always had some curious little gift, some funny little story to share with me. He was warm like the sun, like you. Perhaps that’s why she loved him so much.

I don’t need to tell you her name, nor do I need to hear it again. So I’ll just call her- The Lady. That’s who she was. I wanted to be like her- beautiful, powerful, unstoppable. A noble of the Night Court. (Closing her eyes, slowly scrunching up the blanket in her fist) If you can’t win against them, you might as well join them. Isn’t that right?

Maybe I could have held on to my hate if she’d killed my parents. But it was a faceless soldier of hers who killed them, before she found my brother. The Lady taught me how to fight, how to dance, how to look pretty and how to conquer. She moulded me into the vampire I am, and it was she who turned me.

Sunshine. I became like this, because I wanted to finally be able to protect my brother. I needed him to know he could rely on me. There was nothing he had to be afraid of anymore. I wanted to be strong so we could fight the world together.

But he couldn’t accept what I’d become. I was now the very thing that had killed our parents. (Struggling to speak) It....it was *me* he was afraid of. Sunshine, he- he ran away from me.

My brother didn’t want to be turned. The only other way for a vampire to keep a human with her until eternity’s end, is for her to....to enthral him. Permanently.

But for a human to be put under thrall indefinitely, he first needs to be....to be broken. And my brother by then was completely broken. At last, he had nothing to live for, except her. He was truly hers.

(A longer pause)

*(SFX: Playing with the listener’s hair. It comforts her.)*

I did see him again, after he’d....he’d become her thrall. Some of his old warmth had returned. He was still himself, but....(staring blankly at the bedsheets) he was someone else. He’d always get jittery, anxious, when his Mistress wasn’t with him. He was completely dependent on her. His world revolved around her. But do you know the strangest part?

Despite everything she’d done, Sunshine- despite how utterly she had broken him- there was still that look in her eyes. The Lady....she’d only ever looked at my brother with love, and with this bright, guileless smile on her face. As if just seeing him made her heart skip a beat every time. As if she genuinely couldn’t see what she was doing, was wrong.

What happened....?

(Taking a deep breath) It was love that made her slip up. Just one moment of weakness was all it took. (Eyes far away) A stroke, of serendipity. And he was free. He ran away from her, into the darkness of the night. There- there was a thunderstorm that night. (Holding her Sunshine close) I don’t like storms, sweetheart. I hate them.

It wasn’t very long ago at all. I....Sunshine, why am I speaking about my brother like he’s dead? He’s not. (Insistent) He’s not! I can....I can *feel* he is out there. He is still alive. But the Lady and I still haven’t found him. (Whispering) It will just take some time.....it’s only a matter of time....

What?

(Smiling ever so faintly) No, my sweet, naive pet. (Caressing his cheek) Letting him go wouldn’t be for the best. You wouldn’t expect something you’ve loved and nurtured his entire life, to be able to survive out in the wild all on his own, now would you? (Whispering quietly) How can you expect the Lady to do the same, hm?

No. I....I’m angry with her, but I don’t....I don’t hate her. (Eyes flickering with intensity) The worst part is, I can understand how she feels. What it’s like, to fall in love with something you treasure more than anything in the world, and do everything in your power to hold on to them. (Whispering) *Everything.*

When you love something, you keep it with you forever.

I’m not going to make you my thrall. I....I saw what it did to my brother. I don’t want that for you. I don’t, my sweet. (Kissing him deeply) So....(breathing audibly, up close) I have to ask....

Would you hate me if I turned you?

After daily checks on Raniere's status, today's the day that the Inmate Locator updated and showed a new location for Keith Raniere: Atlanta FCI. And as far as I know, this is the first report; that is not to shout ""exclusive!"" but I think it's clear that Raniere no longer has supporters barking out his status as they once were. 

Before saying anything else, I think the likeliest scenario is Raniere doesn't get much more than a cup of coffee at the facility. It has a reputation for being transit point. Its main facility is classified as low security (which is a relatively recent shift); that doesn't fit well with someone the BOP knows is a ballbreaker, nor does it bode well for Raniere as a potential target. 

This is a good time to recall that when Raniere last made major moves (when he was taken out of Brooklyn MDC) he moved westward in three stops: first to Lewisburg USP, then Oklahoma FTC, and finally Tucson USP. Which is to say, Raniere moved first to a larger prison within the BOP's Northeast region, then the national hub, and then to his final destination in Tucson.

This is just my spitballing but a similar pattern in out of from Tucson USP to Oklahoma FTC and then Atlanta FTC suggests that Raniere could be headed to a prison within the BOP's Southeast Region. Notably, within the Southeast is Coleman II USP, a facility (like Tucson USP) with a ""dropout yard"" that caters to prisoners low on the foodchain (e.g., those who quit gangs, snitches, cops, and sex offenders).  

Regardless, I'll continue to be following where the Vanguard is every day. ",24,1765990249.0,theNXIVMcase,4,1.0,False

Let's dive deeper, with a boring office job that pays well, you can get a more comfortable place to live, better food, insurance, a good car, better equipments for your hobbies and you'll get to buy expensive yummy coffees during your break, plus your parents get more money. But when you chase your dreams, you might be unemployed at the moment, working part time, eating junk food, live with your parents (not a bad thing), you don't have the privilege to spend like an average person. But what if someone already has a job they like but the job doesn't pay well, it's the same as what I said just now, but they get to enjoy their job. In the end it's almost the same no? If you have a job you don't like but you get paid well, you suffer for 8 hours, but the rest of the hours you get to enjoy. If you get a job you like but doesn't pay well, you get to enjoy for 8 hours and then suffer for 8 hours. But people can argue that you can still live comfortably with a low paying job.



But lets talk about the outliers, how about the people who have a job they like AND also pays well? Or people who have a boring job but doesn't pay well? Did they sacrifice anything? Did they gain anything? How about the people who studied for a normal job, but they couldn't even get it? And for the people who got a job doing what they like, did it make you hate your passion?



I guess in the end, I just want to know your experiences. Let's start with me, I'm 18 and I'm a few years from true adulthood. For me, I'm taking a degree to get a realistic job, I'm chasing my dreams while I study for something realistic, I'm trying to make games in hopes that one of them takes off. Even if I don't succeed, I get to look back without complaining or having what if thoughts. **Dreams are meant to be chased, not achieved**, but if you do achieve them congrats. So how about you guys? What decision did you guys make, and what U chose to do after that? Any regrets? Any sacrifices? And do u think you would've had a different life if you made a different choice?


And lastly what are your dreams? I'm not talking about being able to wake up tomorrow, being able to drink a beer today, or being able to buy a good meal. I'm talking about dreams you're chasing, not things you can already do/ doing. And any advices?",1,1765989673.0,Life,6,1.0,False

Complaining about SJWs and also doing the enlightened centrist bit in December 2025? That doesn’t read like an honest attempt at grifting or propagandizing himself in current day, it reads more like a young guy that was already preaching the new age “fiscal conservative” memes that basically now just boil down to “spend $3.75 less on coffee a week and you too can be wealthy” and he hit it big so it hardcore solidified his worldviews and he literally hasn’t mentally or ideologically evolved since being a young 2016 era anti-sjw edgelord.

I’m looking for a place where I can continue working on my laptop after my regular work hours. Since I work from home during the day, I’d like to get out in the evenings and work somewhere else. Ideally, a cafe or a workspace where I can have some tea or coffee and where no one would be bothered by me spending time with my laptop.

Light music or a bit of background noise is totally fine. As you know, many cafes in Berlin close early in the evening, and I’m having a hard time finding a suitable spot.

I live in Schöneweide, so somewhere nearby would be great, but I’m also fine with places up to about 30 minutes away.

Do you have any recommendations?

This week I had some really good days, truly, very significant moments of peace and valuable days, tranquil family moments, days at work without any kind of psychological symptoms, but yesterday something really bad happened. My mind, without stimuli, unoccupied and with nothing to do, started attacking my autopilot again while I was working (driving my bus, something I do daily). Thoughts like:


How do I do this?
What's the next thing I should do?
Do I really know how to do this?


My mind trying to control automatic things like driving, shifting gears, pressing the clutch pedal, navigating between cars, things we normally do without needing to use heavy reasoning to execute them, like riding a bicycle, brushing our teeth. The problem this causes is hypervigilance; when the mind has nothing more interesting to do, it can start wanting to ""occupy itself"" with anything, and when this happens with our automatic processes like breathing, driving, etc., it generates anxiety and a very unpleasant discomfort, really.


I woke up feeling a bit unwell today because of this; I couldn't have coffee because my stomach was still upset due to the unnecessary mental strain of controlling automatic things. But I'm going about my day; it's possible this will happen a few more times, but the best thing to do is not give it any importance. When we don't pay attention to this type of thought, it tends to lose strength; it's just a classic symptom of deep detox, or things that greatly change our lives.


Similar things happened to me around day 30 to day 50, where I had two weeks or more of very strong daily panic attacks. I just had to endure it, try not to lose control, and keep in mind that it was just a symptom and not a sentence. Afterwards, I can say that I cured myself of chronic panic attacks. Sometimes certain phenomena similar to attacks occur, but they are far from strong, just some triggers of the sympathetic nervous system being activated, a lot of attention or a feeling of danger, but weak things.


As I always say, you have to have a lot of willpower to want to get better, because when it's just you and your mind, man, without wanting to exaggerate, before calming down, your mind tries to drive you crazy, because you took away its ""treats,"" like a spoiled child. This is called deconditioning. But it's worth it when you get out of the tyranny of dopamine spikes. Life changes and you want to live again.

1pp1385,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1pp1385/feeling_hopeless/,Feeling Hopeless,"Hi all, just wanting to open up about my struggle with sugar. It’s been years, and I have been pre-diabetic since 2021. Even now, knowing the risk, I can’t stop. I’ve tried many times, it always fails no matter what I do. Especially when there’s a social gathering and there’s lots of sweets. A big weakness for me is coffee, sounds funny maybe but I love super sweet coffee and that’s the one thing I feel I consume a lot. 

The amount of times I’ve started to do well with no sugar, then immediately just fail and give in has been crazy. I don’t understand why sugar has such a chokehold on me. I feel like a failure. 

Honestly it’s not just sweets but I’d say junk food in general, stuff like chips, fast food and pastries. Going into 2026, I want this to change. I want to be able to just never crave or eat sugar again, or at least be strong enough to control it and have it every once in a while. But as of now, my goal is to stop completely until I can get my blood sugar under control. I’m at a loss, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Could anyone give tips as to what helped them?

Even just from a biological perspective.

My husband is back working since our baby turned 2 months, while I am still off until baby is 7 months. Before he went back to work, we were doing so great - I felt so supported, the house was clean, we took turns getting extra sleep - everything was going so smoothly. 

Since he's back working, he sleeps in the guest room on weeknights to get a good sleep (he works construction so his job is physically demanding). But that means 5 nights a week I'm on my own. He leaves for work at 7 in the morning and that's around the time when baby finally sleeps for longer than an hour, so I don't see him then.

 Then he's back home at 5 but twice a week he does sports so he's gone again for a few hours. Then other evenings, someone in his family needs help, or he is meeting his friend who he hasn't seen in weeks for a coffee, or he has to work overtime etc. All good reasons but it means I'm alone yet longer with the baby. and I get so jealous that whenever I leave, I'm on a strict time schedule. I can't just take an extra half hour in the shop because I bumped into someone and ""couldn't get away"".

When he is home, he is very good with the baby, handles nappy changes etc. But he is still living life at the old tempo - I'm taking lightning quick showers, dinners are prepped in 20 minutes, hoovering etc is rushed because I know baby might get hungry or fussy at any time and need to nurse. Whereas when my husband needs to shower, etc, he can still putter about the place and scroll on his phone a bit before getting in. When he cooks, he likes to make complicated dishes which take longer, and can be over an hour or two in the kitchen. It's not that he's deliberately trying to be slow, it's that he just doesn't get it.

I'm just feeling so resentful. He's a better husband than many many women have, but even still it feels like I'm tethered to baby while he has 80-90% of the freedom he used to have. I'm even starting to feel annoyed with him when he needs to go somewhere when I don't need help, just because of the principle of the thing. I know I'll feel better again once baby is sleeping again, but is there any better way l can cope?",65,1765989149.0,breastfeeding,37,0.95,False

I am a 34F INFJ from Cape Town, South Africa. I am 170 cm tall, with naturally curly black hair that I wear straight in the colder seasons. I am curvy fit and love working out - especially weightlifting, running and pilates. I grew up in a Christian home, but consider myself more spiritual than religious. I appreciate and respect all religions and am open to getting to know the person you are, without judgment. South Africa is a multicultural country with diverse cultures, faiths, and 12 official languages. I studied the Sciences and Engineering, and spent most of my time focusing on my studies and work. For that reason and because I am very introverted and love my solitude (too much), I have never dated and am now finding that I would like to fill that space in my life. I am new to this, so it may be a little awkward at first. 

Things I love to do: 

* I enjoy reading (mostly self-help books), but have been challenged to read more fiction, so I have many books on my current TBR list. I am currently rereading my favourite annual book (The Four Agreements), ""When the Body Says No"" by Gabor Maté, and ""I who have never known men"" by Jacqueline Harpman. 
* I love classical music and am a huge fan of Erik Satie, Vivaldi and Debussy. 
* I also enjoy listening to a wide range of piano pieces, especially when solving mathematical equations or building educational robots as part of my job. 
* A huge fan of Hans Zimmer, Max Richter, and Ludovico Einaudi. 
* EDM is a favourite of mine when I am working out. It adds to the happiness of released endorphins :). Fun fact: I love to dance, but I only do it for my dogs right now (introvert things). 
* I like to meditate and have been using the Insight Timer app for a few years now. I started meditating after attending an Introductory Meditation course at the Practical School of Philosophy in Cape Town. I really want to participate in a 10-day silent meditation course (Vipassana) in the new year. 
* I paint in my free time and enjoy going on solo dates. I like visiting museums and new coffee shops. My upcoming solo date plans are to go to the Planetarium for a day tour, and the South African Astronomical Observatory for a night tour and stargazing :)
* I used to enjoy sending snail mail and want to pick it up again in the new year. 
* I love writing poetry and would like to publish my own book one day :)
* Sharing the Action For Happiness Calendars :)

I haven't watched Star Wars, and I am planning on watching some of the movies over my two-week vacation. If you are a Star Wars nerd, then that is a plus. I would like to hear your take on the films. 

There is so much more I want to say, but I will leave that for our conversations. I appreciate kindness, integrity and mutual respect. If you've made it this far and would like to chat, feel free to send me a message.  
I'm looking forward to talking with you. Have a lovely day!",4,1765989056.0,MBTIDating,1,0.83,False

Let the Mariah Carey and ~~Plum Cake~~ Gaajar ka halwa take-over begin.

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Texas Is the Statistical Favorite

The Longhorns’ recent performance was so dominant, even Le Moyne’s coach probably filed for a refund on his coffee. Texas shot 50% from the field, with **six players in double figures**, including Tramon Mark’s 18-point lead and Matas Vokietaitis’ 16/10 double-double. Their offense is a fully loaded espresso machine—unstoppable, aromatic, and likely to cost $7 in a hipster café.

The spread here is **60.5 to 62.5 points**, implying bookmakers think Texas will win by enough to fund a small town’s worth of Gatorade chugs. The total points line (140.5–142.5) also suggests a high-scoring affair, though Texas’ 95-point outburst last game makes “over” look like a safe bet unless Northwestern’s defense is… *gasp* …a functioning sieve.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Updates, and Why Northwestern Is a Mystery

Texas? They’re fine. No major injuries reported, and their bench depth is so absurd, they could play **Simeon Wilcher** (11 points off the pine) during a midgame trivia break. The only drama is whether their starters will take the second half seriously—Camden Heide (10 points) already seems to be pl

Imagine a person who is about to commit a crime. This thing could stop the person and divert them from such horrid thing to do something else, like get some coffee instead. Oh youre about to do something absolutely crazy like eat something you dont notice youre allergic too and will kill you, it saves you by stopping you. About to take drugs... oh no thats bad coz people dont want to stop that... maybe not that eh lolol. Shit you wont even need cops at some point probably. 

Of course it can also just do what you already see in those ads of people who cant decide which hat to buy for their dog and the AI makes the decision for them.

Just like the title says, I've been dealing with diarrhea during my fast. I fasted for the first time last Monday. Other than diarrhea shortly after my meal, I was fine. That was until Thursday. While fasting I had diarrhea in the afternoon (I've been eating my omad at about 6pm). I went to the bathroom probably 6 or 7 times from noon till 5pm. I drank a LOT of coffee that day and after some research, I concluded that I had too much caffeine while fasting, resulting in diarrhea. I didn't fast after that for the rest of the week. 

And then this past Monday I fasted without any issues, had my omad that night with some fried foods. Had diarrhea afterwards (seems to be the norm) and then diarrhea the next day during my fast. However, Im sure that the fried food was the cause of my diarrhea the next day on Tuesday. That was my fault. But then Tuesday night (last night) I had 1 lb of ground beef, with 1 cup of shredded cheese, divided into 2 burritos with onion on them only. And now here I am, on the toilet, making this post lol.

1pp0veu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp0veu,Clean Luxury Daily Rotation,"After wearing these pieces for a while, this rotation naturally became my go-to for everyday luxury without feeling overdressed. The Thom Browne and Ralph Lauren items are the ones I reach for when I want to look clean and put together but still feel comfortable all day. The fabrics feel smooth and structured, and they hold their shape even after long wear. I’ve worn them for casual meetings, city days, and slow weekends where I still want the fit to feel intentional.

Acne Studios and AMI quickly became staples once I started rotating them more. Acne feels very modern and minimal, with fabric that drapes nicely and never looks sloppy. AMI is softer and slightly more relaxed, which makes it easy to wear for hours. I’ve worn both for coffee runs, short walks, and full days out, and they always sit well whether layered or worn on their own.

Maison Margiela and Loewe were pieces I didn’t expect to wear as often, but they grew on me fast. Margiela feels thoughtful and elevated when you actually wear it, not just look at it, and Loewe has that soft luxury feel that’s really noticeable once it’s on. These pieces don’t scream, but they definitely stand out when you pay attention.

For footwear and finishing touches, I usually rotate Birkenstock when comfort is the priority or Louis Vuitton when I want the same outfit to feel sharper. I’ve tried both enough times now to know they completely change the vibe without needing to switch the whole fit.",1,1765988730.0,AllChinabuy,1,1.0,False

1pp0tr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1pp0tr0/does_my_ex_have_add/,Does my ex have ADD?,"I think my ex partner might have ADD or something similar. Before reading, please understand that I know I’m not perfect myself and can be messy every now and again and have a few bad habits myself, but living with her has been absolutely overwhelming. I’m not here to bash her but to try and understand whether she may have something that explains her living habits, rather than her just being extremely messy like I had originally thought. She has a short attention span when it comes to watching tv shows, movies, following recipes etc. She’s really messy and didn’t/doesn’t take any pride in our home. She can be quite financially impulsive and is easily swayed by social media (had to get the dog, the BM on finance, book an expensive trip abroad when we really couldn’t afford it etc). All the bills come out of my account and if I’m lucky, I might get her half of the  mortgage 2 weeks after it came out. All this makes me think she might have ADD.

We had been together 5 years and are still cohabitating together until our house sells. She doesn’t clean and can’t cook. She will attempt cooking every now and again but usually burns whatever she’s making… even if she’s just reheating something I have made she’ll manage to burn the pan. I don’t mind this so much because I normally cook and clean immediately as I go along and I’ll still cook for her if we are both in the house at the same time (we work contrasting shifts) 

She never cleans or does basic housework. Simple things like putting laundry away or matching socks together after they’ve been washed is like an alien concept to her (she then steals all my socks, and repeats the process, meaning I have to buy new socks to replace all the lost ones which she then goes ahead and steals - I reckon I have about 7 pairs of socks to my name with the rest all awol). She herself has an absolute tonne of clothes she doesn’t need and is constantly buying more. 

Our downstairs and en-suite toilets are disgusting. I only use our main upstairs toilet and always clean up after I have been in. She’s the only one that uses the other two and has denied the mess was hers (I explained it cant have been me so she had to admit to it)

We currently sleep in separate rooms, hers is like a bomb hit it. In all our time living together, she has never tried to keep on top of the mess. Clothes are strewn everywhere, the wardrobe, under the bed, on the floor, her makeup table is also a mess. Sweet and chocolate wrappers lying around, empty coke tins. She continues to buy more clothes for every time she has an outing coming up. There’s about 4 or 5 tea/coffee cups in her room at any one time. If she’s been on a night out, she’ll go into the kitchen and dump everything there - high heels left on the kitchen floor, cheap rings from Penney’s on the counter, handbag, coat etc dumped on one of the chairs. This will all sit there for at least a week, but often longer. 

On the rare occasions she does try to tidy (like if she thought someone like one of our parents would be calling) she would just shove things in the nearest cupboard (for example, her passport was in the cupboard under the kitchen sink for a good 6 months, along with a some of her jewelry). Her car is a similar story, just rubbish everywhere, spilt coffee and soft drinks and McDonald’s wrappers. 

She can’t watch tv or a movie without going straight onto her phone. So she would have asked me in the past to watch something on Netflix; and within 5 minutes all her attention would be on her phone.

I have confronted her before about it, it usually ended in argument so I either tried to tidy after her or bought extra laundry baskets, extra waste paper bins for around the house. On one occasion she dismissed me asking how I would ever cope with children if I couldn’t cope with her. 

Sorry for the long winded post; TLDR my ex is messy af, financially impulsive, can’t cook or clean and has a short attention span - does it sound like she has ADD? ",0,1765988622.0,AskIreland,15,0.25,False

Byron’s mother is dead, and his best friend has kicked him out of their house. It is summer 2017 on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. And what’s worse, Byron has no desire to remedy his situation, to heal, or to move on. His inability to grieve pushes him into self-indulgent punishments and pleasures, which, to his dismay, form yet another cliché, another kind of romanticization of the death of his mother. But enough of that. He has pools to open, to clean, and to maintain.

Living out of his boss’s pickup truck, 27-year-old Byron the pool boy refuses to leave his island. In the course of his work, he falls in love with a girl who goes missing, a fuck-buddy whose life is a genuine struggle (and not a self-induced simulacrum of one), a widow whose pool he cleans. Three times? Really? He knows he is the problem, that his way of feeling is stunted; long stretches of void interspersed with gushes of radical desire. But he presses on. Byron stays up until sunrise smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee with old man Cornelius. He bathes in the ocean. He gets involved with a strange group called “The Radical Hegelians.” But there is that pesky feeling again, that he must face something unfinished. A grief deferred.

When Cornelius offers Byron a gig down in New Orleans, Byron must choose who he wants to be. To stay and suffer is to imbue his mother’s death with the meaning it deserves, right? To leave is to become like everyone else: a person who something happened to, and who then moved on. As far as Byron is concerned, this is a choice between life or death. The problem is, he can’t tell which is which.
