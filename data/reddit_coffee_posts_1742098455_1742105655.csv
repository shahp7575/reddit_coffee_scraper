1jcf3rw,https://i.redd.it/rwki4e29tzoe1.jpeg,CA Marollano‚Äôs ‚ÄúRebrand‚Äù is Peak Comedy‚ÄîShe Really Thinks We‚Äôre This Gullible?,"So I just saw CA Marollano‚Äôs latest ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a changed person, I swear!‚Äù rebranding post and I nearly choked on my coffee. 

Suddenly she‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBusiness Astrologer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpiritual Entrepreneur‚Äù? Oh, please. We‚Äôve seen this play out before: once the old hustle starts getting too much heat, slap on a new label and hope everyone forgets the past.

Remember when she was peddling her ‚Äúmagic‚Äù lip tints and skincare? Because, you know, ‚Äúesoteric cosmetics‚Äù are apparently a thing now. Never mind the complete lack of any legitimate scientific backing. If you questioned her, you were basically told you ‚Äújust don‚Äôt understand the deeper truths.‚Äù Sure, Jan.

The biggest red flag? Everything about her brand screams money grab. From sky-high readings to pseudo-spiritual products, she‚Äôs always known how to milk the gullible. And guess what? Now she‚Äôs targeting businesses, meaning, bigger wallets, bigger paydays.

Some highlights from her meltdown:

	1.	Claiming she‚Äôs been ‚Äúpunished by karma‚Äù for going against the universe. Because apparently, karma only shows up when the audience starts to catch on.

	2.	Insisting she‚Äôs ‚Äúlearned her lesson‚Äù and that this new direction is pure. Right. We‚Äôve heard this same song and dance from countless scammers before.

	3.	Hyping up her ‚Äúnew era‚Äù of spiritual entrepreneurship, which is basically code for ‚ÄúI can charge even more if I slap the word ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô on it.‚Äù


It‚Äôs comical how she thinks a single social media post can erase her track record of fear-mongering and overcharging. If people want to believe her, that‚Äôs on them. But personally, I can‚Äôt help but laugh at the audacity.

Bottom line: A new coat of paint on a busted car doesn‚Äôt fix the engine. She can rename herself, restructure her ‚Äúofferings,‚Äù and even rewrite her entire ‚Äúspiritual journey,‚Äù but it‚Äôs still the same hustle at its core.

What do you all think? Is anyone actually buying this rebrand? Or is this just another chapter in the never-ending saga of scamming 101?",1,1742105224.0,insanepinoyfacebook,0,1.0,False
1jcf1vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1jcf1vq/disappearing_spoons/,Disappearing Spoons,"This just happened and I'm so confused.

I woke up really early to feed my cat and as I was making my second coffee and waiting for the kettle to boil, I decided to wash up the dishes in the sink from earlier. All that was in the sink was two soup bowls, a pan, two spoons (which are distinctive as they both have bright yellow handles), a butter knife and two forks.

After I had washed the bowls, knife, and forks, I reached into the sink for the spoons but they were nowhere to be seen. I felt around for them and couldn't feel them. I shrugged, thinking that I missed them and once I emptied the sink, I would see them. I washed the pan and emptied the sink, expecting to see the spoons at the bottom. No spoons to be seen. If they had been the fully stainless steel ones, I would've just thought I couldn't see them but these spoons have bright yellow handles so I'm confused on how two spoons have just vanished into thin air.

The only people here are myself and my mum but if she washed up, she would've washed everything up, not just two spoons. It's not like spoons get up and walk away by themselves. ",1,1742105004.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,1.0,False

1jcevmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jcevmq/severance_theories_observations_gemmas_fears/,"""Severance"" Theories & Observations: Gemma's Fears, Lumon‚Äôs Testing, and More Mysteries","Title: 

After diving deeper into Severance, I've started noticing some fascinating and somewhat unsettling patterns. Here‚Äôs a collection of thoughts and questions that have been buzzing around my mind:


---

1. Gemma‚Äôs Fears Are Luxurious & Avoidable

Gemma‚Äôs fears ‚Äî flying, the dentist every six weeks, and thank-you notes for gifts ‚Äî seem almost trivial. They feel like the kind of ""fears"" that come from a position of privilege, luxury, and comfort. I can‚Äôt help but think these are almost ungrateful in comparison to the true horrors that the characters experience, like being severed or living in an oppressive corporate system. There‚Äôs something unsettling about how avoidable these things are in the grand scheme of Severance‚Äôs world.


---

2. The ""Convenience Chip"" Theory

I believe Severance is setting up a world where they‚Äôre perfecting some form of ""convenience chip"" ‚Äî a device designed to keep people in line and manage their desires and needs. The catch, however, is that the chip requires refinement from people who already know each other, like Mark and Gemma. This places them in a precarious position, potentially exposing them to exploitation by the wrong hands.


---

3. Gemma‚Äôs Fashion and CEO Simulation

Gemma's fashion choices seem deliberately aligned with the old CEOs in the Procurement Department. It's as though she‚Äôs being groomed to emulate the leaders of Lumon. The testing and refining process within the company seems to combine the consciousness of the CEO (and possibly Gemma) by simulating the behaviors and temperaments of Lumon‚Äôs past CEOs. This way, employees ‚Äî especially those in ""testing"" roles ‚Äî will reflect the qualities of these powerful figures. It's like a mind-melding experiment that both preserves and manipulates Lumon‚Äôs identity.
In other words 
The testing and refining is combining ( CEO + Gemma ) consciousness by simulating the ceos of old (9 principals / tempers )  your personal innie at the ""dentist"" will exibit qualities of lumon leaders and ones refined self so you will be well represented and looked after while an innie

---

4. The Infomercial: Convenience, Care, and Connection

Ultimately, Lumon is working toward delivering an infomercial-style product that promises convenience, palliative care, and even a way to ""visit"" dead relatives (looking at you, mark and his gemma). It seems like an elaborate system designed to provide comfort to those who are suffering or have disabilities, but at what cost? Is it true care, or is this just another form of control wrapped in a comforting package?


---

5. Irving and Cold Harbour: The Black Goop

Irving‚Äôs experiences with the black goop and his obsession with the testing elevator make me think he‚Äôs seen something deeper in the walls of Lumon. The texture of the black goop is almost like something that could drown and suffocate someone at once ‚Äî perhaps a metaphor for the oppressive nature of Lumon itself or why the Nurse was testing Gemma. Is this why Irving is so invested in painting and understanding the testing rooms? His dedication to the handbook and indoctrination into the company‚Äôs philosophy is a way for him to process his own experience within the system irnhas he already been brain washed and refined. 


---

6. Food Scarcity: Tokens & Luxury

Food scarcity is a big theme in Severance. The fact that food is rationed and tokenized, with things like dried meals and high-water-content melons being luxuries, speaks to the control Lumon has over basic human needs. Mark even receives a food voucher for his injuries, and yet, he doesn‚Äôt know how to eat with chopsticks ‚Äî a subtle hint at how disconnected and infantilized the employees are in their severed and un-severed states.


---

7. Mark‚Äôs Risks: The Search for Coffee

What if Mark had chosen to search for coffee instead of going his heavily pregnant sister? Would that have triggered into his innie? Yes it seems, Would he have been completely overtaken by his ""work self""? This presents a huge risk for Lumon, and they seem to go to great lengths to ensure these kinds of scenarios don‚Äôt happen.


---

8. Helly‚Äôs Knowledge of Dylan‚Äôs Privileges

Helly knows a shocking amount about Dylan‚Äôs privileges (visists from his wife)‚Äî how? Why is she so informed about these things, was Helena slipping or did Dylan go against protocol's and dibby bod on himself? Is this an indication of manipulation, or is Helly. Rmerely an exception to the rules?


---

9. Devon and Mark‚Äôs Relationship: im trying very hard to understand why Devon would go against marks  Regarbies wishes, saying i have custody of his brain. That is an incredibly odd and untrue thing to say in any circumstances unless you legally had custody of someones brain. We see behind the scenes and see Cobel potential for a character redemption arch, but Devon has no knowledge, could devon be Mark legal outie handler or is she infact working for lumOn?


---

10. Are Babies Being Severed?

This is a wild theory, but the concept of babies being severed keeps coming up in the back of my mind. Are there hints of this being a potential plotline? Or is it symbolic of how the severed process could extend to the next generation?


---

11. Cobel‚Äôs Reverse UNO Card

Lastly, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if Cobel (or someone else) will now pull an ""UNO reverse card"" also known as branch transfer where marks innie and outie switch allowing mark to finally talk to Gemma. Could it be that she flipped the system on them in cabin 5 or a portable device, much like how Petey smuggled out a voice recorder of Mark in the break room.


---

Severance is a deeply layered show, and these thoughts are just the tip of the iceberg. What do you all think? Are there any theories or observations you think I‚Äôve missed?

Just a little conversation, no drama. He ended up asking me out, which was surprising since I was not his ""normal type"". We been dating for about three months when he had given my best friend a ride home from a party. About 15 minutes after he returned, I got a phone call at the house (before cellphones) from her. She was crying and basically just begging me to forgive her because they had ""made out"" in the car when he dropped her off. I still vividly remember the way his face dropped when I turned to look at him. He knew exactly what she was telling me and had no intention of telling me himself. So I just broke it off with him and went home. I didn't take his calls all weekend  and at school that following Monday, he had brought me flowers to ""make it up to me"". When I made it pretty clear that I wouldn't tolerate a cheater and there was no way I was going to ""take him back"", he tried to give those same flowers to my best friend and she flat our rejected him. Then his brother laid into him for ""screwing up a good thing"", which made little insecure me feel pretty good. Life went on, but it didn't end there... Ten years later, I'm married and have a couple kids.  My husband and I would occasionally have to work at the same time, so I would sometimes drop my kids off with my mom. One of those days when I was picking up my kids, my mom had a message for me. My ex had called my old phone number and left a message on my mom's answering machine. He said he had seen me dropping off my kids that day and asked if I was single and would I want to ""grab a coffee or something"" with him sometime. I could not contain my laughter after hearing that message. Three months I dated this guy in high school and 10 years later, he still remembered my phone number and had the audacity to ask me out. Now, I severely lack self confidence, but that whole situation made me feel pretty good about myself and I will randomly think about it still over 20 years later. üòè",6,1742104174.0,offmychest,2,0.88,False

1jceqke,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jceqke,[Advice] Restoring my GF‚Äôs Timex Watch,"TL;DR I want to restore this watch my girlfriend gave to me (Timex Exposition T40091 - band, case, etc.) and customize it a bit as well. Where do I start?

Hey yall! This is my first time posting here and I am asking for input from the watch community. This watch was given to me by my girlfriend after I told her i have a couple Invictas and a Suunto. 

Story time! This morning I went over to her house (she lives with her parents). We were gonna start a batch of croissants, but because of the Alabama weather and the tornado watch, I helped her father (hopefully my in law eventually) by rebuilding a generator. That‚Äôs why I am wearing a finger cot in the images and it makes typing painfully hard lol. Screwdriver slipped and sliced my thumb open. 

ADHD is taking over ok. So later at night we started talking about watches somehow. I think she brought up that the Timex she wears she loves, but the light up display does not work and she brought out another Timex (pictured above). She said she used to wear that one before it got cracked. I said i thought that was really cool and I could see myself picking up collecting watches as a hobby. I told her I have some Invicta, Suunto, and a couple Casios at home and she asked me why I like them.

Obviously, I just had to give her my spiel as to why Swiss and Japanese quartz movements are superior and yada yada(I‚Äôm sure yall have heard about this *passionate* topic before lol). 

Just before I was about to head home, she gave me the broken watch pictured above and said she really liked it but wanted me to have it because I like watches. 

This was not just a small gesture - she is not sentimental about many things at all , but her watch is one of them, even the old one. I was touched deeply. I want to return the favor by restoring it for her and give it back to her as a gift.

She is an artist. An absolutely amazing 2D animator. So I want to be able to craft something for her that she will see the quality in and be proud to wear. I want to build a custom leather watch band, restore the watch housing, replace the crystal, etc. 

I know it‚Äôs not an expensive watch and I could probably just buy her a new one to replace this, but I don‚Äôt think that would be very genuine of me. 

She doesn‚Äôt need me to buy her the biggest diamond or take her on the fanciest dates. She values my craftsmanship and devotion to her. We have talked about when we are ready to marry, I will propose to her with a wedding band I will hand forge. Mosaic Damascus steel with an inlay of 24 karat gold around the center of the ring. Certainly not the traditional diamond and platinum ring. But my effort, my work, she values more than rubies.

I do not know how to make Damascus. But I know I can learn for her and enjoy it as much, if not more, than she will enjoy the end result. And this passion to learn and create is what drives me to restore this watch for her. 

This was a very long Hazlenut Coffee caffiene-induced ADHD post for me to ask - where can I learn how to restore this watch/who would I need to talk to about finding parts? I don‚Äôt mind going to a jeweler or watch store, but I want to be doing most of the work cuz I enjoy it and I want to be able to tell her ‚ÄúI made this for you‚Äù.

And not on topic for this subreddit, but if anyone knows another page where I can ask or learn about starting a home forge, I would love to be pointed in the direction!

 If there are spelling errors, apologies. This finger cot is sucking the life out of my thumb and I have worn off 3 tagaderm  bandages lol.

1jcep6q,https://v.redd.it/yiv3j5m3ozoe1,Review: supvox 58mm distributor + tamper,"I've been looking for a reasonably priced distributor and came across Supvox distributor + reversible tamper on Amazon for 1499 and ordered it. 

Somehow reddit doesn't allow multiple videos in one post so I merged all review videos in one. In the first 2 pics you'll see the distributor disassembled into pieces. The silver parts are metal (lilely SS) while the black part in the center is made of ABS. The assembled unit is hefty, almost 590gms. Due to the threaded joints, there's some play to adjust height of both distributor and tamper. 

The distributor works as intended but there's a lot of retention. I've shown that in the last part of the video. I don't know if adjusting the height would resolve it, but I'm still trying to work my way around it. The tamper sadly is not deep enough to compress the puck. In the video, I've tamped on the mat, but I tried tamp on the edge of the counter and the unit is not deep enough. I have to tamp with a proper tamper after using this. 

Overall, it looks well built but falls short of functionality. I still don't understand how these simple coffee accessories cost so much. At 1499 just for the distributor, I'm struggling to justify price performance. And that's just the floor pricing. Something like Normcore costs probably 5x of this.

1jceovq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jceovq/healthy_eating_vs_junk_im_getting_pissed/,Healthy eating vs junk!! I‚Äôm getting pissed!,"Okay I need to vent!!! I‚Äôve ate a pretty clean diet before pregnancy, cooking myself every meal 5 days a week. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant I really want to stick to that. My only indulgence before pregnancy was drinking coffee and coke, but I completely quit. I would only drink soda on the weekends anyways and eat out with my boyfriend for 1 meal (and it normally comes from a restaurant, so 2 meals a week not from home). 

I have a friend who‚Äôs pregnant right now too and her whole pregnancy she follows no restrictions at all and I don‚Äôt judge her for that. They drink coffee and soda every single day, eat fast food whenever they want. Sugar and sweets. I never said anything to her about it, because it‚Äôs her pregnancy and her life! Now that I‚Äôm pregnant she is being sooo weird about how I eat?! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs making her feel guilty for the way she eats on a daily. Because it feels like I‚Äôm being shunned by her for the way that I eat. God forbid I cook myself healthy meals !?! She says just drink soda and coffee, it‚Äôs a myth that caffeine does anything to a baby, just drink water to balance it out. Then she sends me a tiktok of a pregnant girl saying ‚Äú when you‚Äôre pregnant you‚Äôll never want to eat a homecooked meal only fast food or takeout or anything trashy‚Äù and quotes it saying facts. Like what the hell! Get over the fact that I told you I‚Äôm not doing that and quit pushing it on me! I‚Äôm so pissed! I‚Äôm eating healthy for my baby and I and I don‚Äôt care! 

And please no one take offense I‚Äôm not judging anyone for how they eat when they themselves are pregnant. I myself am just feeling judge and like I‚Äôm being too much for wanting to eat a clean diet for my baby and I.

1jceog3,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1jceog3/my_coworker_is_a_bully_and_she_gets_away_with_it/,My coworker is a bully and she gets away with it,"I‚Äôm (26F) a lead host at a restaurant and train all the new host that are hired. Last Summer I trained a new girl Makayla (24F) from Moldova. I‚Äôve gotten to know Makaylas personality really well working with her for about a year and hanging out with her outside of work. She does come off very likable and caring at first but she is two faced. One day she‚Äôs giving coworkers including the managers back rubs without being asked and buying them coffee. Which I honestly find inappropriate and kind of being a kiss ass. But I left it alone because the managers didn‚Äôt seem to have a problem with it. I waited until the General Manager would see it with his own eyes and handle it. The General manager is also from Moldova. He does let her get him coffee. He doesn‚Äôt care for Makayla massaging our coworkers instead of doing her job.

Being around Makayla so much I do know she is married and I‚Äôve met her husband. They are working towards citizenship in the US. In 2 weeks she has her interview for citizenship. Only a few people know Makayla is married at work. She is actively flirting with multiple men we work with such as servers, kitchen manager, FOH managers. Makayla uses the kitchen manager to get free food. When he pisses her off shes constantly blocking and unblocking him or over seating the restaurant to back up the kitchen. I watched her make out with him after our Christmas party. Anytime she flirts with a server and doesn‚Äôt get what she wants out of him she gives them less customers than other servers. She also offers to pay them to marry her because she‚Äôd rather get her citizenship that way. She‚Äôs asked me to marry her once but I don‚Äôt want to try to prove something that‚Äôs not real and illegal. 

Makayla picks on other hostess because of the way they look and she makes them quit. She said to a 16 year old host her foundation is too dark, her acne is bad, and her teeth are too white. She‚Äôs called another host fat and asked how does she have a boyfriend. Makayla is very possessive of the iPads and won‚Äôt let the other hostess work on them. Then when they complain she tries to tell the story in a way that she is trying to give them advice and she cries. The managers go with Makayla‚Äôs side and say it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt understand her she‚Äôs European. I understand her loud and clear and it has nothing to do with where she is from. 

One day at work I told Makayla to take a group of people to a table and she suggested a different table. I said no please take them to this table the server needs to get caught up. She took the customers and I didn‚Äôt see her for about an hour. Even after that she was giving me the silent treatment. She told my manager I said fuck this restaurant fuck the servers fuck the kitchen. I told the manager what really happened and I don‚Äôt know how that would be possible I said those things in front of the customers I needed her to take. My manager believes me but told me to let it go and act like it didn‚Äôt happen but if Makayla continues being standoffish to let her know. That really pissed me off that I was told to let go of a lie about me because it just felt like she‚Äôs getting away with being a fake bitch again. Why should I have to work with someone that makes me feel like they‚Äôre putting my job at risk? Not only that she‚Äôs mean to everyone we work with for no reason. But I acted like nothing happened so I could get my job done.

Makayla sometimes asked me to hang out after that. I would always find a way to say no unless we were hanging out with a group of friends. Then I eventually softened back up and started hanging out with her alone again thinking we‚Äôre actually friends again. 

Recently Makayla asked to become a server for more money. Management hasn‚Äôt made her a server yet because we don‚Äôt have enough hostess for the summer. Last week a reservation complained to our general manager about how rudely Makayla spoke to them and they are leaving. So the General Manager put a hold on promoting Makayla to become a server because she ran off customers. 

Today I was working with Makayla and another host. I told the other host Makayla let me know one of the reservations didn‚Äôt like us sitting them at two tables instead of one. That host started complaining about our general manager in training acting sporadic. Makayla just comes out of nowhere and yells ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay guys I‚Äôm leaving in 2 weeks then you can talk about me!‚Äù and walks off. I followed her and asked her ‚Äúwhat are you talking about?‚Äù Makayla said we were talking about her. I said ‚Äúdo you want to know the truth or just assume shit?‚Äù She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I walked off. Found my manager and told them I was talking with the other host about a reservation complaining. Makayla was listening in not very well on our conversation and accused us of talking about her and said she‚Äôs leaving in 2 weeks. He asked did she just put her two weeks in? I said no she thinks she‚Äôs not getting citizenship and will have to leave and she can‚Äôt put that on me. He agreed you shouldn‚Äôt do that to your support system. I let the manager know I confronted Makayla and I‚Äôm worried she will run to her favorite manager and twist everything that just happened but he can also speak with the other host that was also accused. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure if I did half the stuff she does I would‚Äôve been wrote up or fired a long time ago. I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so special about her and how she has most of management wrapped around her finger.

Their service has been declining so much these past few years.

Today I tried ordering food THREE times during a movie. The same food. The same order. 

Ordered food and water when they came to swipe my card. Nothing came. 45 mins later, pressed again and asked for food and water. Nothing came. 45 mins later, asked for just water. Wanna guess what never came? 

Other weeks, I order food and it comes missing fries when the meal comes with them. Other times, I order food and it never comes, but they still charge me for the food and of course add a mandatory 20% tip. A few weeks ago, I ordered a diet coke and got a coffee. I put up a card to get it corrected. they brought me M&Ms. Like am I crazy????

Staff keeps chatting in the adjacent hallways inside the theater. They keep giving my food to the wrong people nearby, who then send it back and it never gets to me. Last month, some teenager was on his bright a** phone during an entire LOTR showing, and passing crew members never said anything. 

On top of all of this, their food quality and choices have plummeted but prices have skyrocketed.

They got free flights, accommodations, and meals. I could have chosen anybody but offered this person bc I know they don't have a job (due to legal history and lack of drive) and are broke. Well it‚Äôs clear this person doesn‚Äôt know how to be humbled and has major insecurity issues/is mentally unstable. 

We came to a park and I needed to pay for parking. They had the car trunk hood up so I couldn‚Äôt see the license plate. I called them asking for the license number, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if they heard me since I went unacknowledged. So I called again but didn‚Äôt get a response so I walk up to get it myself. They blow up on me and calls me the c word, saying that they won‚Äôt tolerate being treated like a dog just bc I  paid for their trip. Calls me a bitch and c*nt in the parking lot in public. 

This person has been nothing but ungrateful and never once thanked me for the trip or paying for their meals. They also freaked out on me in public over something just as dumb before but this was the worst. I have never met such an ungrateful trash human in my life. So we went our separate ways in the park. This park is almost two hours from the hotel we are staying at. I called a good friend and asked for advice - they told me to leave and don‚Äôt even go back. But I did, I wanted to give this person a chance and planned on bringing them to the hotel then part ways. But when I got back they said they had nothing to apologize for, and called me the c word again. So I had them take their stuff out and left them. I‚Äôve never done anything like this before and tbh don‚Äôt think I would have had the courage to if my friend hadn‚Äôt supported me, but it just felt so wrong to allow myself to get abused so I left. 

PS If you‚Äôre wondering about the other time this person freaked out on me. We had made plans yesterday to drive down to the city and grab coffee and pastry on the way. I figured we‚Äôd get it to go. When we get to the coffee shop they get it then sits and eats. Which is fine but I asked them how long it would take to finish the coffee.

Day 1: 
Phoenix - charged at RAN to 100%
Drove to Sedona, did a hike, charged at RAN to 100%. 62kWh in 49 minutes. Location next to restaurants
Drove to Flagstaff, hung out friends, stayed overnight at hotel

Day 2:
Flagstaff - charged at RAN to 100%. 47 kWh in 1hr
Drove up on highway 89 towards Utah
No level 3 chargers or Tesla compatible superchargers until Kanab, UT so this was the part of journey where we were nervous
Drove up through Page, AZ and made it to Kanab, UT where there were ChargePoint superchargers. Charged to 100%. 82 kWh in 1hr 10min
Drove to Bryce Canyon area and stayed at a place in Cannonville, UT. 

Day 3: 
Drove about 8 miles for hike, then drove to Tropic UT because this was the nearest level 2 charger location - drove to The Bryce Canyon Inn which had a couple Tesla destination chargers with J1772 adaptor. Charged 20 kWh in 1hr 55min. The Inn had a great coffee shop and a few restaurants and a market nearby. Drove back to location where we were staying (6 miles)

Day 4:
Drove back down to Kanab UT - charged 56 kWh in 1hr 5 min.
Drove down through Page, AZ. Made a quick stop at Horseshoe Bend which is right off the road.
Drove down to Flagstaff. This is where things for VERY tense. Due to temp being in the 40‚ÄôsF, rain/flurries, strong winds, and driving up in elevation, we made it to the RAN with JUST 9%! Guess-O-Meter said only 28 miles were left. Charged at RAN to 100%. 99 kWh in 1hr 13min
Made it back to Phoenix 

Overall, car was great to drive
Used Autonomy Platform+ on I-17 which worked great but unfortunately didn‚Äôt work on highway 89 which was a large portion of the trip
Trip planning and Mileage estimation on navigation was pretty accurate 

Would I make another roadtrip like this? Given that we were very close to running out of juice on the way back to Flagstaff, probably not, unless range is higher (at least 400 miles), more superchargers are built in all the cities and in between cities just like gas stations, and our destinations had chargers.

It was frustrating to have to wait so long even at superchargers and didn‚Äôt like having to consider environmental factors like weather and elevation which could drastically change range.  

Tell me your experiences, tips/tricks, likes and dislikes.

So I (34F), had a roommate (25F) for about a year before our living situation proved to be problematic (the location, not the gal). Let‚Äôs call this gal R. 

We lived in an apartment for 9 months before we realized the management was absolutely garbage at tending to the units. We had a horrible mold problem due to a roof leak that management absolutely knew/were notified about, so R and I decided that we needed to move ASAP. 

During this time, an old friend B (35F) and I had started hanging out more frequently. 

Quick backstory for B: she and I met when we were in 5th grade and had always been friendly and on the outskirts of each others lives. Her family had always put up a great facade of being super friendly from the outside, but behind closed doors both parents are big time narcissists. I didn‚Äôt know about any of her major family dysfunction until we were into adulthood. After about 20 years of friendship, we were usually on the same page about who we are and how we operate. There was a brief period of time where we talked about living together, but she told me after about a month of planning that she wasn‚Äôt ready to share her living space. I was a bit miffed since the rejection came after so much talk about living together, but I accepted it and moved on. 

So when R and I started talking about finding a new living situation, I asked B for some real estate insight since her family had a long history of property management. To my surprise, B then decided that she would like to find a larger property so she could move in with us. I asked her if that was something she would be comfortable with since she had a rough experience with a previous roommate (who was a male friend of hers). She said it was something she had thought about doing because she‚Äôd never had female roommates and told me that she trusted me and would be open to living with R since we had already been living together with little-to-no issues. 

I checked in with each respective roommate about how they felt about the situation. I knew that I was going to be the glue that kept this unit together, so I was trying my best to make them each feel comfortable, help them connect, and make sure we were all on the same page. 

Quickly after that, B informed me that her family had a property opening up in a nice part of town that we could get a good deal on. It had belonged to a deceased family member who I knew and loved when they were alive, so I was on board. 

Rent split evenly from the $4200 house equated to $1400 apiece. It was a tad over budget, but we agreed that for the property and location that it was great deal. 

When all was said and done, we signed a year lease with B‚Äôs narcissistic parents as our landlords. Though there was the occasional red flag and strange interaction, I was convinced that these people I had known for 20 years would not be meddlesome. 

This‚Ä¶ was a mistake. 

It started with B venting about how much her parents (specifically her mother) were badgering her and micromanaging the move. The cleaning crew had given a quick work over for the property, but we were shocked to find numerous stains and damage from the previous tenants. It should be noted that the previous tenants were friends of B‚Äôs mother. 

When B brought up the dirty condition of the house, her mother berated her and gave her such a hard time for bringing up any sort of changes for the property. After these uncomfortable interactions, R and I limited our direct inquiries and B was acting as the bridge with her family. In retrospect, we should not have let B take the brunt of the interactions. We didn‚Äôt know what more to do about it at the time, so we just rolled with it. 

Soon after moving in, I was swamped with work and constantly busy away from the house. B worked remotely and R was not working yet. During the first month or 2, I felt  a bit left out since B and R got to spend time together during the day and I was working hard to pay off bills from the move. I brought it up once I was able to articulate my issues, and we were able to move forward. 

Another month later, B started to vent her mild frustrations about R. B felt that R was home too much and behaving immaturely. As someone who had already lived with R for a year, I understood how she felt since R hadn‚Äôt quite started her ‚Äúadult‚Äù career. The initial reaction of R not working and figuring herself out was tricky. However, since R is 9 years younger than us and has had a whole slew of trauma throughout her life, I recognized that we are simply different people trying to figure our own lives out. R has never lacked in work ethic, she simply couldn‚Äôt get the ball rolling on her own career. She had money to pay her bills, and she was actively looking for something in her field. 

This point of contention repeatedly came up for several months. It came to a head 4 months after we all moved in. B was fed up that R was home ‚Äúall the time‚Äù and B never felt that she could have her own space. 

Please note: B only knows this because she was the one that almost never left the house. She usually slept into the afternoon and didn‚Äôt leave her room often. Anytime we did try to hang out and watch something, she often left early because she was too tired. And if R ever saw B hovering near a space in any respect, R would offer to leave or share the space. B never confronted nor fought during these interactions. 

When B was becoming more belligerent about her problems with R, I immediately shut her down and said that I will not talk smack about R. If B had any real complaints with R in terms of reasonable issues, we could discuss it. But just to act in a R bashing session, I would not be involved. 

I told R of this interaction so she would not be blindsided. I‚Äôm also defensive of R since she had no other advocates and I see her as a little sister. 

B backtracked her frustrations and I assumed we moved forward from the fumble. I believe this was the initial turn of the tide. 

Holidays were pretty quiet. B spent some time with my family in order to avoid hers. This was not a problem, and we had a nice time. 

At the beginning of the new year, B was starting to spend time with some friends that she‚Äôd known for a very long time, but some had been known to do pretty hard drugs. The 3 of us don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes, but R and I could smell it on B whenever she came back from hanging out with the ‚Äúvice friends‚Äù. 

Another strange element to B‚Äôs behavior is that she would yo-yo her attitude towards her family. One day she would be swearing them off and wishing they were dead, within a week she would reach out to them and reconnect. She would then complain about how much her parents belittle her, we‚Äôd have therapy time at home, start making plans about her future that edged her family out of her day-to-day life, and she‚Äôd visit them and the cycle would begin anew. 

After feeling like we were all stepping on eggshells with B and her family, we called a house meeting to lay it all out in the open. I started with asking B if everything was ok and if she felt overshadowed by her parents constantly pestering her about the house. B‚Äôs mom was condescending and routinely checking in about the state of the house. We had a productive conversation and decided that we would move when our lease was up in July. 

With the new plan, we started looking for properties in mid January. I was very firm in the fact that I didn‚Äôt want to move too far from our current location and I needed to stay in the county. Between my job, family, and friends in the area, I did not want to move far from a certain ‚Äúbubble‚Äù. I was upfront about that the moment we decided to find a new place. R was on the same page, and B agreed. 

When we all started looking at properties, we shared them with each other in the group chat. B started looking at properties that were outside the area of where I feel comfortable. I didn‚Äôt immediately shut it down, but I did mentally dismiss it. 

This is where everything went to shit. 

In early February, I came home from work and was chatting with R when B joined us in the living room. B came in to talk about some options that she liked and wanted to show us. She opened with, ‚ÄúI know it isn‚Äôt your first choice, but I did find a pretty good option in [rough city]‚Äù. 

As soon as she said the city, I immediately blurted out, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I followed with an awkward laugh and proceeded to explain the reasons that the city wouldn‚Äôt work for my daily commute or accessibility to friends and family. R chimed in said that the area B was suggesting wasn‚Äôt ideal for her either. 

After a beat, B bristled and started lashing out. She complained that we ‚Äúnever care about what she needs‚Äù and that we ‚Äújust loved living in suburbia‚Äù while she has to think of her budget (this is laughable because she easily made the most money of all of us. She was working remotely so had no commute to worry about). 

At this point, I got up to leave because I was frustrated and just wanted to get out of the conversation before it escalated. Seeing this, she targeted me and kept saying that I ‚Äúhated‚Äù her and that I was ‚Äúmad at her‚Äù. I got  fed up and repeatedly told her that I‚Äôm not mad at her and that she should not tell me how to feel (R had to remind me of this statement because I was so frustrated that I kinda blacked out). B continued to be angry and kept saying ‚Äúwhatever ‚Äú, which is something we had discussed that she should stop saying because it was passive and dismissive. I told her to talk about what was really bothering her instead of saying ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù, which pissed her off further. 

R (bless her) did her best to meditate and calm us all down. B told her to leave her alone and turned away. I left for the evening to have dinner with my parents (which was my regular routine that day). 

About an hour later, we get a text from B:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sleep at [friend‚Äôs place] tonight. I‚Äôll try to find another living arrangement when our lease is up. I know text can get muddied but I process better in writing. I really love and appreciate you both but clearly we have different ideas of communication and I should move closer to the city or I may move states completely. I hope if we don‚Äôt live together we can still continue the friendship. I just feel attacked when I try to communicate and I say whatever because I felt shut down. I don‚Äôt appreciate having that thrown in my face and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm the issue. I‚Äôm happy to move on my own and you both can do whatever works best for you. Love you lots.
I also went in there to try to be friendly and I felt like I got a cold response. If I try to express myself or explain my side I feel like I get attacked. I was just trying to be realistic about money and what I can afford. Part of communicating to me is to be able to resolve conflict and I feel it‚Äôs only resolved if I agree or go along with something I didn‚Äôt feel included in. That to me feels like walking on eggshells to be agreeable. I‚Äôm sorry that our communication doesn‚Äôt quite much but it doesn‚Äôt have to be tense. I know none of this is malicious and maybe it‚Äôs just not a roommate match. I still love you both dearly but I think for the sake of our friendship should you both still want that I need to move somewhere on my own.‚Äù

With that, I was fully prepared to continue our living situation as roommates and was ready to just cohabitate comfortably. 

One hour later, the next text comes:
‚ÄúJust so you guys know so you can plan. I need you to both move out when you find a place. You don‚Äôt need to stay til the lease. I can‚Äôt handle the stress as I need to focus on school. I‚Äôm sorry. Please start look for places.‚Äù

To say my flabbers were ghasted would be an understatement. Even typing all this out now is making my blood boil. 

R immediately leaped into planning and making sure our legal asses were covered. She asked for a written notice that she and I would not be held to the lease since it was B who was requesting that we leave earlier that the agreed date. B responded:
‚ÄúI do not believe you will be on the hook for rent but yes you are welcome to email them. We can talk but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs productive as it just turns into an argument. I need to focus on school and finding work so you guys can figure out where you want to go. I‚Äôm staying out of that. I just need peace to focus  so please figure out what you need to figure out and start the moving process asap.‚Äù

From here on out, R and I almost never really saw B in person. She usually shut herself up in her room and made sure to slam doors whenever we were home. Anytime she was seen at home, she practically ran to and from her destinations within the house. All of our conversations were in text form, which R and I preferred since we could have everything in writing. 

A day after the fight, she texted:
‚ÄúOkay. You guys are aware that you are both moving out as soon as you find a place right? That was clear?‚Äù
When I confirmed that, she wrote:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still really angry about how I was treated and have been treated for speaking up for myself. That is why I‚Äôm trying to cool off and not speak with you both. If you‚Äôd like to talk before you both move I need it to be respectful if possible. Maybe we can schedule a time to chat. I would appreciate you guys hearing me out completely before jumping in and I‚Äôll do the same.‚Äù

R responded with: 
‚ÄúWhile I agree that we can set aside a time to discuss everything, I do believe we need a mediator. If you would like to have your therapist, or a third party that we all choose to be present, either via zoom or in person, I can make accommodations.‚Äù

B‚Ä¶ did not like this. 

The next few messages were rapid fire:
‚ÄúA therapist? What are we in couples counseling?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt speak like adults? I am definitely feeling blamed and ganged up on.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can either move out now or pay rent for the rest of the lease and then move out but you both are moving out no matter what. This is not okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not all choosing btw. This is our property that we, regardless of how you feel about me or my family it was extremely generous to have a discount on rent and you both agreed we need a mediator when I disagree. I am trying to keep things civil and adult. I keep getting ganged up on and taken advantage of and I can look into eviction proceedings if need be.‚Äù

It was at this moment that all hope to keep B rational and stable flew right out the damn window. Any possibility of continuing a friendship had just gone up in smoke. 

I feel the need to clarify that at every stage of our living situation, I would regularly ask her if she felt comfortable with our choices and that I do not want to make her feel forced into any situation. I knew that R and I had a good dynamic and we had our own way of doing things, so every time there was a decision to be made around the house, I made a point of checking in with B. And at every opportunity, she gave the all clear. 

From there on out, we moved quickly in our plans to get out asap. We were able to find a property within our budget that was in a great location, so we started proceedings to get a new lease and had it locked in within about 2 weeks of all the chaos. 

Throughout the process, B had almost daily texts asking if we found a new place yet and asked ‚Äúwhat was taking so long‚Äù. Her constant badgering through text was almost always ignored unless we wanted to share useful updates. R asked me to stop responding to every little text that we received in the group chat. Around that time is when B began to be more demanding. 

On February 16th (just 12 days after our big fight), B texted:
‚ÄúJust not sure why it would be taking that long to get approved since I haven‚Äôt been updated on anything other than awaiting approval.‚Äù

R responded with:
‚ÄúA 30-day notice was submitted to the landlords on Feb 8th.‚Äù

But because B wanted full information, we then got a series of texts:
‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt answer my question.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou do have until march 8th to move but you will be charged the prorated rent and utilities which is why I suggested moving at the end of February. Regardless my question was the anticipated move out date since nothing has been effectively communicated.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlso what is the hold up in the confirmation? Is there a reason for that? The question was aiming to clarify since nothing has been communicated.‚Äù

R, ever the calm & collected queen that she is, responded:
‚ÄúAt this time, there is no further information to be shared. Six business days have passed since the official 30-days notice was given. Ten business days have passed since the wish for relocation was communicated. When new information is available, you and the landlords will be notified of the update.‚Äù

Since this whole rundown has already become a novel, I‚Äôll run through the final days of the chaos without the text play-by-plays. 

The final week at the shared house was tense and stressful since R and I had to get all of our things ready to move. B generally stayed out of our way during this time. We scheduled movers and were communicating exclusively through text. B was out of the house the day of the move (in fact, I saw her pull away when I got back to prepare for the movers). 

We got into the new space quickly and were eager to have our stuff out of the house as soon as we could physically move it. 

B attempted to pack some of our kitchen items for us, but R was quick to shut that down as the items were thrown into garbage bags with no care or organization. 

She also became weirdly controlling about what time we would be by to continue moving our things. I gave her 1 courtesy text when I went by after work, which she told me she greatly appreciated. When R did not do the same, B was irate because she didn‚Äôt want us just ‚Äúshowing up to someone else‚Äôs house‚Äù. Going so far as to say:
‚ÄúNext time, tell me you are coming because it is still my property not yours, so please tell me when you're going to show up that's not OK to show up at someone's house.‚Äù

R responded with:
‚ÄúIt is not your property. It belongs to your parents. Legally, [OP] and I have access until tomorrow at 5pm. If I have to call law enforcement to supervise the move out process, I will. If you or your parents put undue burden on me or [OP], I will also file a formal complaint to the city. We are entitled to an uninhibited move out process. I owe you no legal notice as you are simply a roommate.‚Äù

Obviously, B did not take too kindly to that, firing back with:
‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure my parents have this message because that is not okay. This is not your property. I‚Äôm happy to have them come supervise the process tomorrow.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are letting you have extra time and not holding you to painting which you did against the landlords wishes. All I was asking is to let me know when you are coming. You still have a move out date of 5pm that hasn‚Äôt changed.‚Äù

(Note: that dig about painting against their wishes, B had agreed and encouraged us to paint our rooms, and even went with us to pick it out. The only reason she did not do the same is because she couldn‚Äôt make up her mind and decided to forgo it)

After that, we got all of our things out and practically ran out of the house a day earlier than agreed. On the final morning, R went by for a final check of things in the garage and to drop off our keys. As a final middle finger to B, R sent her 1 last text:
‚ÄúNot only did the apple not fall far from the tree, but it is rotten from the inside out. Never contact me again.‚Äù
(This is particularly dirty because B‚Äôs fear was to become like her father, who is a whole supervillain in and of himself)

From the fight to R and I moving in to a new property was exactly 3 weeks. Our support system and some crazy luck came together to get us out of that awful house. 

We can only speculate what caused her to become so hateful seemingly out of nowhere. We went from planning our futures together to threatening eviction in such a small amount of time. My running theory is that whether it was something she thought she should be doing and wanted to push through, or if she was just pulling us along until she couldn‚Äôt fake it anymore, she was lying her way through life and our friendship. There‚Äôs also a theory that she was jealous of me and several aspects of my life. When I asked R if she ever talked smack about me, it was usually something to do with the fact that I‚Äôm close with my parents and don‚Äôt have many obstacles (mental health, career,etc) in my life. She would regularly say ‚Äúmust be nice‚Äù when I brought up healthy boundaries and relationships with my family. 

1 month after the move, B emailed R and I:
‚ÄúOP and R,
¬†It makes me sad that our friendship was thrown out of the window because living together wasn‚Äôt healthy.¬†
I feel like I was put as the villain in your minds and I can‚Äôt change that, but I‚Äôd like to say how I was feeling and I hope you can try to understand.¬†
Early on R and I got along, but it felt like a two against one thing as you said you didn‚Äôt feel included, OP.¬†
You both like to gossip about other people and friends of yours, so this¬† to me, felt like an immature ‚Äúyou are with us or against us mentality‚Äù that triggered some bullying from high school.¬†
I am not overtly emotional and it takes me longer to process emotions and heal but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt care.¬†
I felt my boundaries were not respected, I felt taken advantage of, and I felt that the more I tried to communicate the more blame was put solely on me.¬†
It then became a dynamic of two against one, again, but this time OP and R against me. That is not a fun position to be in and I felt that I tried to take responsibility over and over for the criticisms I was given often, yet I did not feel the same from OP or R when I tried to assert my boundaries and tell you both what I needed. I just felt ganged up on.
¬†I don‚Äôt feel like I had space or time to explain myself before I felt defensiveness. I felt as though I was walking on eggshells and like I traded a toxic family for another. I am hoping that wasn‚Äôt intentional but the fact that you both were happy to end the friendship completely over not being compatible as roommates did show a lack of care. I‚Äôm not sure why it had to get to that point but we all had a part in it and you both chose to put all the blame on me.¬†
I hope you can understand that when I wanted you both to move out, it was because I was at my absolute limit. I was tired of tolerating what I believe to have been a friendship that I deeply cared about, turned toxic. I was trying to be flexible, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I could say no without conflict. ¬† The only way things would be resolved is if I gave in. If you read this, I appreciate it, and I‚Äôm sad that our friendship was broken because we all couldn‚Äôt communicate as roommates.¬†
I‚Äôm moving on and doing what I need to do, but I figured I‚Äôd try to share my feelings on it. I won‚Äôt tolerate behavior that felt manipulative to avoid conflict. I know who I am and am working on healing. I hope the best for you both going forward. I truly do.‚Äù

I genuinely don‚Äôt know or understand where her perspective came from on this. While I know I‚Äôm not a perfect person or blameless in this whole situation, her double standards on communicating and actions really threw me for a loop. 

And 5 months after we moved out, she messaged me directly:
‚ÄúHi OP. I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I just wanted to apologize for my part in living together and our argument. I am sorry I hurt you. If you are willing, i‚Äôd love to meet up for coffee and just chat and apologize in person‚Äù

After a day of processing this message and the audacity it came from, I responded:
‚ÄúI received your text. 
I cannot and will not be willing to meet up with you. Your actions have hurt me to the core and I will not be able to ever move past it with you. If you truly want to say your apology, you can text or email‚Äù

Almost immediately after sending it, I get her final response:
‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôm surprised to hear that. I was equally hurt by your actions. I guess all I can do is say I apologize then and move on. I won‚Äôt reach out again.‚Äù

While I‚Äôm spoiled for choice on names to yell at B, I don‚Äôt truly hate her. I know she has suffered a lot through life thanks in large part of her horrible parents and terrible decision making. I also know that she was blessed to have so many opportunities to make a better life for herself, but routinely fell back in line with what she knew. So while I don‚Äôt exactly forgive her for this awful experience, I see how she fell so far from other (healthier) opportunities. 

R and I are still living together, and we love our little home. Though I‚Äôm in a bit of a pickle, because she has a very serious boyfriend that is talking about their future together, so I‚Äôm contemplating my future living situation üôÉ. But for now, all is good. 

Last I heard, B moved out of state and her parents moved into the house. I‚Äôm grateful that I don‚Äôt have any direct contact with any of them. ",1,1742101654.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

She found out through Facebook reels made by gurus (she frequents it a lot) that the only way to be rich is to start your own business/be an entrepreneur, problem is she has 0 knowledge of actually running a successful business so she goes to YouTube to search for ""how to make 6 figures by running an online business with 0$ startup costs!"" Or ""how to be rich by doing Amazon affiliate marketing!"" 

And I knew from the getgo that these videos are made by scammers who only care about that YouTube ad revenue or for suckers to buy their courses so they lie out of their behind to convince stupid people that they can be millionaires, but my mom genuinely thinks these people are legit and it's serious advice because narcissists are actually very easy to scam if you tell them exactly what they want to hear. 

 she tries and tries all the advice from these different videos (with help from me because she barely knows how to use a computer) and surprise surprise none of work at all, she hasn't made a single penny after two years of trying these and she's convinced that one day it will work and she's a smart ""businesswoman"".

she told everyone she knew that she works for Amazon and they should support her business but none do, she even turned her Facebook into a business profile where she spams links to her online print on demand clothing shop with overpriced t shirts with lazy canva art or ai art and is surprised that nobody is buying them, thinking that millions would come in and buy. 

But one day she came across a YouTube video saying that you can create a GoFundMe page so that people can give you money to start your own business, and she always wanted to run a coffee shop because she thinks it will be successful like Starbucks and be rich, so she goes ahead and created a GoFundMe me basically saying that she has an idea of running a coffee shop but she's broke to fund it herself so she's asking everyone to just chip in 15000$ so she can be wealthy.

I was honestly so shocked on how delusional she is, she wants to start a business that will most likely fail off of everyone else's dime, and if she somehow  succeeded and she became rich she would give NONE to charity or back to the people who funded for her, GoFundMes are usually reserved for people who are in extreme crisis like hospital bills or their house burned down and they are homeless but she thinks nah, give me money so I can be rich! Im better than everyone else! 

And again after 4 months not a single soul donated to her gofundme and she is SURPRISED like what?? Are you that full of yourself? That's when I realized that narcs are totally far gone mentally and there is 0 possibility of changing them because they spent decades of their life believing that they are the most perfect and important human being the world has ever laid eyes on and everyone should grovel at their feet like peasants.

in august last year i finally hit a wall with my alcoholism wrt my physical health. severe withdrawals, wretching, stomach cramps, shaking. i text her saying i have to go to the hospital. she says find an immediate care facility that will take me. IC staff says i need rehab. i relay it to mom and she says ""ok but you are not coming home, you are going to sober living."" i agree, home's a trigger, and mom doesn't do much in supporting my sobriety efforts at home. so i do rehab and some sober living until i landed a job and decided to get an apartment. mom was on board and agreed to co-sign the lease.

after i move in, however, she's texting me saying she's worried i'll relapse and she'll be paying for the apartment. moving's stressful, it was christmas, and my job wasn't giving me the days off i needed for doctor's appointments. and so i did end up relapsing. i quit my job and recently found a new one. my mom has paid for march's rent. i aim to pay her back for that, plus the payment she's made for treatment. i think she made a good call with sober living. i also think i could have stayed in sober living a little longer, plus not quit my job so quickly.

but, i got a letter from her attached to a bill from the treatment center. the letter says ""you played me."" last time i visited her she said ""you used me to get this apartment so you wouldn't have to pay for it."" she seems to think my problems are all about her. i wasn't plotting against her when i chose this place, i was thinking about how good i was doing finally getting my own place after living at home for decades.

it's not that i owe her, it's the language.

i've also heard from others that she is selfish, and more reliable for financial support than emotional support.

i've sort of been avoiding her while i try to clean up. she makes me feel stressed. while i was in rehab she texted me about how angry she was with my aunt and cousin, and i'm tired of hearing about them (also, it sounded like what was going on was not about her). if i wanna fix my financial situation with this new job i need it without her remarks. got a text from her recently asking how i was. i said ""fine, love the new job, how are you?"" and she replies ""thinking about you and wondering how you are."" call me paranoid, but i think she's not all that bothered.

i get it that my alcoholism doesn't make me great either. it makes me selfish, impulsive, and negative. my mom was raised by an alcoholic, and that makes for a chaotic childhood. but i'm not trying to hurt her financially. if i could be debt-free and completely independent i'd do it in a heartbeat. and if wishes were fishes there'd be no room in the ocean for water, so i struggle.

sorry for the long post, and i'm sorry if it doesn't belong here. i just found that letter in the mail and i'm angry.",3,1742101577.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I flagged as new manager, but I‚Äôve been in the position for almost 3 years. This is gonna be long so thank you in advice for reading.
I figured backstory is important to understand where it all started. If you don‚Äôt care about it, scroll a bit and I‚Äôll signal where I‚Äôm telling what‚Äôs happening today.

TLDR: cashier Kate has always been late since she was hired. She‚Äôs also mine and my GM‚Äôs, Rachel, friend. 3 years later, she no call no show basically once a week, gets there 1h late 2x a week, and the rest of the days a minimum of 30min. Idk how to fix this or how to deal with this, or even how to change my GM‚Äôs mind. It‚Äôs affecting me (meaning my mental health), but even worse, it affects my cashiers, and it puts more workload and tension on them, cause nobody can rely on her to show up. It also affects how they see their management, and the way they react and the boundaries they push cause ‚Äúnothing ever happens‚Äù. Please help 

Backstory: If you go to my profile you‚Äôll also see posts about me looking for a new job cause my current job is literally giving me anxiety hives. I‚Äôm 26f, assistant manager for a fast food place, we‚Äôre a franchise and it‚Äôs only 1 store, ours. I worked there when we opened, I was the 3rd person hired. Started as cashier and by the end of the training I got promoted to head cashier. I was being trained to be assistant manager but had to move out of state. 2 years later when I moved back, I got rehired there and everything had changed completely (1 person of the original crew still worked there).
There was this woman, Kate. She‚Äôs like almost 37, have 2 kids. Shes a cashier and she had been working there for almost 2 years when I came back. She is AMAZING at her job. Her customer skills are honestly great, she‚Äôs kind, helpful, knows the store like the palm of her hand, she does the job incredibly fast, like seriously she‚Äôs fucking great. Her only problem is: she‚Äôs late every single day. Literally everyday. When I started I didn‚Äôt like her much, she was super close to another employee and he was the worst. Me and him didn‚Äôt like each other and he‚Äôd gossip about me to her, and tell lies, mock me etc. she was always nice to me, tho. Our GM, Rachel, was already very close to her. Me and Rachel had a good relationship too, she‚Äôs also a great person. Anyways Rachel would schedule me for before opening, and then her to get there as soon as we opened, 11am and it would be just us 2 for one hour and 2 more people would get in at 12. Because she was always late, I was ALWAYS alone for the first 20-40min. She‚Äôd always show up with her makeup done and a coffee and energy drink on hand. She legit got late because she‚Äôd do all these things before work. I‚Äôd complain about it with Rachel, I‚Äôd call her PISSED asking ‚Äúwhere is Kate??? I‚Äôm alone here it‚Äôs super busy, you need to schedule someone else for 11am I can‚Äôt keep doing this‚Äù and she‚Äôd tell me she‚Äôd talk to her but nothing ever changed. I got pissed at Rachel thinking she wasn‚Äôt actually doing anything, and also built a bit of resentment towards Kate. 
A few months into the job, Rachel had to go on family leave for a few months and she left me in charge of the store, she trusted me and knew I was knowledgeable, and she told Kate to be my right hand. To stay by my side, to help me out and back me up, we were one of the few ppl who knew how to operate and fix things, keep the wheels moving. I started making the schedule, me and Kate got really close and got to know each other, and I‚Äôd schedule her for 11 knowing she‚Äôd get there at 11:30, so I‚Äôd have someone else with me to open. She actually had my back, and she was a HUGE help specially in the beginning, where people didn‚Äôt want to do what I asked, etc. My old issue went ‚Äúaway‚Äù, and if before I had the mindset of the person to trained me years ago, thinking this was unacceptable, now i had gotten used to it and had found a way to put a bandaid over it. Then, when our District Manager overruled Rachel and put a literally demon to ‚Äúwork with me, side by side, like equals‚Äù, I said fuck this and asked to be demoted to a regular cashier cause I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore lol. This brought me and Kate even closer. When Rachel came back, things got better, Demon quit, I took the position back, and us 3 started forming a very genuine friendship. Kate was still late, but it was manageable. We don‚Äôt hang out outside of work, Rachel and Kate have kids, and we all have opposite days off etc, but we legit text and call everyday, and our talks go way beyond work. They helped me plan my wedding when I got engaged, would listen to me vent etc. 


‚ÄºÔ∏è now to the present day:
Idk what the fuck is going on with Kate but she went from being 20min late to being AT LEAST 30. Twice a week she‚Äôs 1 hour late. She lives 5min from work yall I can‚Äôt. She keeps on showing up with her freshly bought iced coffee. We know she is depressed, diagnosed, and lately she‚Äôs been feeling more down. She wakes up in the morning to take the kids to school, then goes back home and takes a nap until it‚Äôs time for work but she always wakes up late. It got to a point where it became a habit to call her 1h before her shift to wake her up, and she‚Äôd still get there late. 
For the past couple months, other people have been getting late too, and it‚Äôs tough bc we can‚Äôt really discipline everyone else but ‚Äúignore‚Äù her. We don‚Äôt ignore her tho, just nobody knows what is talked and done to her. We‚Äôve suspended her. Cut her hours. Wrote her up. We couldn‚Äôt fire her cause we were severely understaffed and for a moment there she was the only cashier who could work lunchtime, our busiest time, so we NEEDED her. Even if me and Rachel worked every weekday together at lunchtime, just us 2, we would still be fucked cause 2 people is not enough (yes we tried). We need AT least a third person, if they‚Äôre strong to handle the busy, and she‚Äôs that person. And like she knows this, she‚Äôs not stupid, so she doesn‚Äôt really care about what she does bc she knows we won‚Äôt fire her. Our district manager has threaten to fire her multiple times but each time, Rachel talks her out of it and things go smooth (ish) for a few days and it goes back to shit again.
It got so bad that now she just doesn‚Äôt show up once a week. She oversleeps ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è last week she got here 1h late, our DM was here and she told her ‚Äúnext time you come 10min late and I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm firing you on the spot‚Äù, and she was serious about it. Rachel and I started scheduling her for 12 instead of 11, so she can make it and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and now she gets there at 12:30. 
Yesterday she didn‚Äôt show up again, I called her 12 times. She woke up at 2pm, texted me and Rachel super embarrassed and apologizing. Neither of us responded cause we honestly don‚Äôt know what to say.
She‚Äôs always been like this, even with the GM before Rachel (Rachel had been hired 6 months I think, before I got rehired). She will not change. Now we have enough staff that we don‚Äôt need her anymore. For now we‚Äôre giving her another suspension, and Rachel is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù about her next steps (I don‚Äôt have the power to fire anyone, it‚Äôs up to her).

Anyways, I KNOW it‚Äôs bad. Like bad BAD. It shouldnt have never gotten this far, I know me and Rachel are biased as fuck, but also besides being late she is a GREAT employee. And if it wasn‚Äôt for being late, she would have moved up sooo long ago. But now I just can‚Äôt see her ‚Äúvalue‚Äù anymore, work wise obviously. I‚Äôm not upset at her as a friend, but as a manager; and I just can‚Äôt look past her being so damn late anymore.
I don‚Äôt think Rachel is gonna fire her, tho. I have a feeling it will all end up like it always does‚Ä¶ which is nothing changing at all.
I guess what I‚Äôm asking is advice on what to do with this whole thing. I can‚Äôt fire her, but I want to so bad. Everytime my DM shows up I kinda hope today is the day she‚Äôll fire Kate lol cause I can‚Äôt do this anymore dude. I never liked calling her before work to wake her up, I find that so insulting and disrespectful, but i did it bc I wanted her to show up, and that was Rachel was doing. Everytime she gets there super late, I just get‚Ä¶ idk depressed lol I loose a few months of life I swear. It‚Äôs so annoying and I feel stupid, and I know our cashiers also think we‚Äôre stupid, cause we fucking are. 
Today I had a call with Rachel and I was honest with her. I told her I love Kate as a friend, but I can‚Äôt look past this anymore and it‚Äôs so disrespectful, she had no consideration with her coworkers, and her coworkers/friends. She said she‚Äôd suspend her and think about the next steps. Idk how to change her mind about this. That is one of the reasons why I wanna quit, but I need a job first.

Sex: Male

Height: 5' 9""

Weight: 145

Race: Caucasion

Duration of complaint: For about 2 years now, increasingly showing worse symptoms

Location: Michigan, USA

Any existing relevant medical issues: T1 diabetic for about 20 years

Current medications: insulin (walmart OTC novolin r and n), low dose adderall for adhd, was taking Welbutrin and Vraylar for a few years but stopped Vraylar about 9 months ago and welbutrin about 4-5 months ago.

Basically, whenever it's above about 65 degrees, with normal or above average humidity, I start feeling heatstroke symptoms very, **very** quickly. Higher humidity makes it even more unbearable. Sometimes it results in me having mild puking, if I had something that might have mildy upset my stomach like coffee, tea or dairy. I'm very worried because I'm moving back in with my family on a small farm, and will expected to be outside a lot this summer, and last summer nearly every time I went into non AC conditions I got so sick to my stomach. It also seems super tied to how sunny it is outside, but I have had similar conditions in hot indoor environments without direct sun. What's odd is that as long as the temperature is around or below 60 I never have these symptoms, even outside, even combined with exercise, which always exacerbates the symptoms. It is NOT tied to hypo or hyperglycemia, but these do extremely exacerbate the problem. This wasn't an issue in 2022, but was starting to become an issue in summer of '23 and summer of '24 was unbearable. I even tried a kind of ""exposure"" therapy where I didn't use AC and honestly it just made symptoms overall worse. Spent hundreds on a dehumidifier, an oversized AC unit and electrical bills. My family doesn't even have AC in most of the house on the farm, and I'm really worried about this.

I should mention I wasn't the best at taking care of my diabetes in my early 20s, but my A1C has slowly come down to reasonable adult levels over the past 3-4 years. I (really my mom) was very good at taking care of it before I was 18 and moved out, with A1C levels in the 6s. 

Thank you for any input on this!

I'd get paid, feel rich for a few days, then suddenly my bank account looked like it had been through a war. Rent, food, random subscriptions I forgot about, that one ""treat yourself"" moment that turned into five‚Ä¶ by the end of the month, I was scraping together coins like I was in a survival game.

At one point, I tried budgeting apps, thinking *‚ÄúOkay, maybe if I track everything, I‚Äôll finally be in control.‚Äù* But I either got overwhelmed by apps that wanted me to manually input every transaction like I was a human calculator, or the ""free"" ones that locked the best features behind a paywall. So, naturally, I gave up and told myself I‚Äôd ‚Äújust be more careful‚Äù next month. Spoiler: I wasn‚Äôt.

It hit me hard when I checked my **yearly spending report** from my bank and realized I had spent **way more on food delivery than actual groceries.** Like‚Ä¶ *double.* That was my wake-up call.

So I did what any **stubborn tech nerd** would do‚ÄîI built my own expense tracker. Nothing fancy, just something that let me log my income, track categories (like ""coffee addiction""), and set up reminders for bills before they ambushed me. Slowly, I started seeing where my money was actually going instead of guessing. The moment I saw a **trend** in my spending habits, things clicked.

Fast forward to now, tracking my expenses feels like second nature. I don‚Äôt have to wonder if I can afford something‚ÄîI **know**. And that feeling? 10/10, highly recommend.

For anyone struggling with money management, I learned two things:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **If you don‚Äôt track it, you‚Äôll always feel broke‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre not.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Small habits beat big resolutions.** You don‚Äôt need a perfect system. Just start logging where your money goes, even if it‚Äôs just in your notes app. Patterns will emerge.

Even though it's a bit touristy as most Americans go there for holidays it's still 100 percent worth it!  
 
This 10 day Costa Rica itinerary includes must-see spots with some hidden spots only locals know while trying to keep it low cost :)  

Note - If you can only spare a week then this [costa rica itinerary 7 days](https://jetlygo.com/blog/costa-rica-itinerary-one-week) by jetlygo has some underrated destinations covered.

Day 1: Arrival in San Jos√©
Most international flights land in San Jos√© (SJO). Skip the generic chain hotels and stay at Hotel Grano de Oro ($$$), a boutique spot with a lush courtyard. If you arrive early, visit the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum ($15, opens daily 9:15 AM‚Äì5 PM) to geek out on ancient artifacts.
Dinner Tip: Head to Caf√© Rojo, a fusion Asian-Latin restaurant tucked in Barrio Escalante. Their lemongrass pork belly is insanely delicious, although slightly more costly than other local restaurants.

Day 2: La Fortuna & Arenal Volcano
Rent a car or take a shared shuttle (3 hours) to La Fortuna,
Hike Arenal Volcano National Park (open 8 AM‚Äì4 PM) for rainforest trails and volcanos..
Skip pricey resort hot springs, I don‚Äôt think they are worth the price. Locals I talked to recommended El Choy√≠n, a free riverside spot near Tabac√≥n Resort. Pack a beer and arrive by 4 PM to avoid crowds.
Stay: Selina La Fortuna offers dorms and private rooms with volcano views.

Day 3: Waterfalls and Coffee
Start early at La Fortuna Waterfall ($18, 7 AM‚Äì5 PM). The 500-step descent is steep, but the swim in the turquoise pool is worth it.
Afternoon: Book a North Fields Coffee Tour ($35, 3 hours). You‚Äôll pick beans, learn about sustainable farming, and sip the freshest brew of your life.
Dinner: Soda Viquez serves heaping casados (rice,beans,plantains and meat) for quite cheap

Day 4: Monteverde Cloud Forest
Travel to Monteverde via jeep-boat-jeep ($25, 3 hours). The ride includes a scenic boat crossing of Lake Arenal.
Check out: Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (opens 7AM‚Äì4PM) is more touristy but Santa Elena Reserve is quieter with similar biodiversity.
Stay: Casa Batsu ($$) has cozy cabins and homemade breakfasts.

Day 5: Zip-Lining and Reserves
Book a zip-lining tour with Selvatura Park (includes 13 cables and a Tarzan swing). For a quieter experience, Curi‚àíCancha Reserve has fewer tourists and you can do some bird watching.
Pro Tip: Visit the Monteverde Hummingbird Gallery (free with reserve entry) to see 14 species zoom around feeders.

Day 6: Manuel Antonio National Park
Beaches and Monkeys
Take a 4-hour shuttle to Manuel Antonio. Book park tickets online in advance (closed on Tuesday). Arrive by 7 AM to snag a spot at Playa Espadilla before crowds hit.
Stay: Selina Manuel Antonio has a pool and sloth-spotting tours. Just a lil warning - those sloths are super cute but a bit stinky lol

Day 7: Mangroves and Sunset
Join a Damas Island mangrove tour ($65, 4 hours). Guides point out camouflaged snakes and crocs.
Relax: Post-tour, unwind at Playa Biesanz, a hidden beach with calm waves.
Dinner: El Avi√≥n ($$), a quirky restaurant built around a 1950s plane, serves killer ceviche.

Day 8: Uvita & Whale Watching

Drive 1.5 hours to Uvita. Marino Ballena National Park (opens 7AM‚Äì4PM) is named for its whale‚àítail‚àíshaped sand bar. Visit December‚ÄìApril for humpback whale sightings.
Stay: Flutterby House ($), a laid-back hostel with nightly bonfires.

Day 9: Corcovado National Park
Take a guided day trip to Corcovado (~$150, includes transport, lunch, and guide). Hike through primary rainforest to spot tapirs, scarlet macaws, and maybe a puma track.
Note: Book through Osa Wild for reputable tours as I used the same. Not sponsored.

Day 10: Return to San Jos√©
Drive back to San Jos√© (4 hours). Stop at Caf√© Cristina in Cerro de la Muerte for award-winning coffee.
Last-Minute Shopping: Mercado Central (open 7 AM‚Äì6 PM) sells hand-painted oxcarts and coffee.


Transport: Rent a 4x4.. Seriously, do it! Roads are rough but manageable. It was my top memory from the Costa Rica trip :)
Budget: $1.5k to $2k per person (mid-range stays, tours, meals).
When should you go: Go in December‚ÄìApril for dry season; July‚ÄìAugust for fewer crowds.

Just do it, seriously. Many friends I talked with asked me to skip Costa Rica because it's too commercialised and there isn't much to explore. I can agree that yes it seems a lot more touristy than something like Guatemala (here is a [10 days Guatemala Itinerary](https://jetlygo.com/blog/guatemala-travel-itinerary-10-days) but still if you can go off the tourist trail for a few days, you will realise how wrong most people (including my friends)!",1,1742100543.0,Jetlygo,0,1.0,False

1jcdvyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jcdvyf/i_told_mil_not_to_kiss_lo_ever_again/,I told MIL not to kiss LO ever again,"TLDR: 
I said: Don't kiss LO or put your cheeks against hers ever again, otherwise I won't stop myself.

In laws visited from overseas this weekend.

FIL is respectful and considerate.
MIL wants to pretend.

MIL showed up with a ""present"" for me and some old books and an old bag and necklace of hers for LO to play with.

I have had huge anxiety over her visit, which obviously resulted in arguments with DH.

DH again told FIL in advance to tell MIL no screens, no phones for LO and to tell MIl to keep her opinions about Montessori education for herself. 
Why DH won't tell MIL himself is another conversation.


First day:
MIL had LO on her lap. Straight away I said: no kisses, please.
MIL: no kisses? 
Me: no kisses.
MIL: Puts her cheeks against LO cheek and said awww.
I raised my voice and said NO KISSES!

At dinner:
MIL: Do you think she will have some rice?
Me: Probably, I don't know I will order and see what she wants to eat, I can't force her to eat.
When the food was served and after LO had been eating noodles, tofu, mushrooms and soup all on her own without me having to pressure her or ask.
MIL asks: Would she have rice?
ME: I don't know.

I then went to bed feeling, that is those kind of ""caring, she's just asking an innocent question"" comments that made me feel like someone is sophocating me, like I'm being pressured into something in a manipulating way.

Next Day:
We had been out in the morning and LO skipped her nap.
The plans changed during the day as FIl started to feel unwell so we all when back to a hotel we were all staying at (separate rooms) in the afternoon.

On the way to the room MIL asked: would LO go for a nap now?

Me: I will handle it, don't worry about it.

MIL stayed quiet and walk away.


Thank you Reddit friends, you trained me well! 

Next Morning:
We were going to meet them for breakfast and to say goodbye.
MIl says she doesn't want to go for breakfast, just a quick coffee because her throat is itchy.

I said to DH, if I tell your mum don't kiss LO, this is why. If she has something she would have been infectious three days ago. Your parents usually get sick when they travel by plane.

We went downstairs to meet them and straight away when she was getting close to say hi to LO I said:
Don't kiss LO and don't put your cheeks against her cheeks.

MIl: ""it's just the aircon, it makes me sick..."".

The master of spin strikes when put under pressure like clockwork.

ME: Don't kiss LO or put your cheeks against her cheeks ever again, just don't, otherwise I won't stop myself.

MIL: raised eyebrows and walked away.

We continued drinking the coffees. Later MIL blew a kiss to LO from a distance.
FIL hugged DH and I goodbye, no LO.
And I said to MIL I hope you feel better.
MIL: oh it's just the aircon, it gives me allergies...
ME: Safe flight.

Does my people pleaser me feel guilty about telling her this? 
Very.

Too aggressive?
Probably, however, she's a master at spinning the narrative and I know she will later say something like I just can't stop myself or similar.
I don't want to have to go home and feel like I was too nice and polite.
So in that sense, I rather say it in an extreme, rude way.
Would she go home and try and plot revenge against me? Absolutely.

It is a physical issue, I don't want her to put herself physically and intimately so close to my child.

Anyway, I feel like I did something wrong.
Probably because I was ""rude"".

But I also feel like something needed to change in the way I react to her antics, so this is the beginning of me learning to stand up for my child.
I feel like I shouldn't have to be dealing with her nonsense.

I got many complex health issues which had restricted me to a low fibre low b6 liquidy mushy diet .. unfortunately it is quite high in simple carbs.. sugars.. fats and not as high in protein and a suppose a lot will be high gi.. minus the sustagen which says it‚Äôs low gi.. üòû due to trying to have high calories low volume low fibre low b6 liquidy mushy easy to go down.. and hopefully pass through..

 recently bought a 14 day trial libre 2 which I finally got stuck on me yesterday arvo .. that conveniently died a few hours later so I couldn‚Äôt fully monitor stuff!

But from recent blood tests my fasting glucose is normal..

However I noticed that my symptoms of dizziness .. shaky.. internal vibrations.. vertigo.. nausea tight chest breathing problem reflux head ache etc seem to coincide with when my blood glucose was going very low.. I‚Äôm in Australia so nmol/l

So.. yesterday when I did finally start trying to ‚Äòeat‚Äô consume my liquidy stuff.. I noticed that firstly upon putting it in and still consuming .. my blood glucose on the libre 2 drops first to
4.7nmol/l.. then starts to rise up while eating my liquidy stuff .. the. I finish and it continues to  rise.. and peaked at  about 7.9nmol/l 15-20 mins after I finished consuming my ‚Äònutrients‚Äô..

Then.. within the next 40mins to 1 hr it rapidly drops to like 3.4nmol/l .. dangerously low! 

And of course coincided with how I was physically and mentally feeling.. shaky vertigo internal tremors .. breathing issues tightness reflux 

But also coincided with body position ..

Whether sitting standing lying walking looking down at phone.. stomach pains.. bowel movements.. or attempted 

I suffered from vitamin b6 toxicity mid last year and that‚Äôs when symptoms of dysautonomia started to appear.. and triggers off SMAS vascular abdominal compressions .. hence change in diet.. so I thought it was all from that..

I was fine before all this plus had a healthier diet of course!!

So going back to numbers.. 

I tried to see if I try and give myself a sip of a sugar hit lol being new to this.. a sip of lactose free iced coffee/iced chocolate.. and then water.. see if it effects numbers or stabilises my vertigo etc

Anyways.. lying down.. it dropped.. and when stomach pain is high up in transverse area below ribs so near stomach .. glucose drops.. when the pain moves down below then glucose rises up again and symptoms not as bad.. as if stuff is passing through me.

Lie down.. it seemed to drop..

Looking down at phone researching.. drops..

I go for a walk .. if the stomach pain moves from high up to lower in abdominal.. then glucose rises again but generally exercise/walking makes me feel better and glucose rises.. blood flow?

So it temp rises to mid to high 4‚Ä¶low 5nmol/l

Stand up and do some research on all this and protein powder supplements to try and looking down at my phone concentrating .. getting shaky 

Glucose drops again to 3.8nmol/l

This is now about 3 hrs after I finished ‚Äòeating‚Äô

I notice this and then take a bit of water .. try a bit of lactose free iced coffee/iced chocolate.. 

Also tried a tiny bit of fig and water 

I got for a walk.. get some air. Ok.. maybe low 4‚Ä¶ but then again numbers drop ..I realised I was looking at my phone again in convo re protein and researching protein lol woops.. numbers had dropped to 3.8nmol/l.. head down looking at phone typing 

Almost like head position effecting  posture effecting bloods.. or blood flow and stomachs ability to digest.. absorb.. gastric emptying ..

I get home.. it drops even lower to 3.6nmol/l after I sit on toilet.. 

20 mins later I start preparing some more ‚Äòfood‚Äô.. having tiny bits as I prepare.. so it returns kind of to around 4nmol/l as I‚Äôm moving around to fridge and back again..

Start consuming my stuff 

It drops to about 3.7 nmol/l within the first 5 mins or so‚Ä¶

Then as I‚Äôm still consuming within 20 mins it is going up.. and finished consuming it is at about 5.3nmol/l

I stand/lean.. to try to help stuff pass through it continues to rise 
6.8nmol/l

7nmol/l.. I walk to go brush my teeth lol still going up.. 7.7‚Ä¶

8.2nmol/l

I‚Äôm now reclining on my side on thr ground against a crate.. long story.. smas thing to try to help relieve pain and get things moving through my compressions

8.3nmol/l we are at 30 mins post my second meal.. still stomach pains.. and my libre 2 had died! So I didn‚Äôt get to see if it would then drop again to mid/high 3nmol/l

Within 1 hr of eating and stay around there and low 4nmol/L and coincide with my symptoms which I thought was pots.. and total dysautonomia..

I couldn‚Äôt check the next few hours .. the next meal .. nor sleeping..

Because I go to bed and the shakes.. the internal vibrations.. the heart pounding and chest tight.. 

So I couldn‚Äôt check how dangerously low I get in bed 

I can‚Äôt contact freestyle for replacement or complain as it is the weekend ‚Ä¶ üòû

Sorry for the long post.. I‚Äôm new..my gp is dumb.. my gastro doesn‚Äôt care.. my dietician and specialist gp all don‚Äôt communicate with each other.. each making suggestions the other doesn‚Äôt agree with lol

Mestinon to trial re gut issues..

Mct oil.. collagen.. salt.. creon.. gastro said no to

Now I realise I got issues with my glucose levels.. 

Does this sound like typical reactive hypoglycaemia so I can mention it to them please?

Where it drops slightly while eating then spikes up high then drops down critically low?

I do have a life in Australia that I can't leave behind for 4+ months, so ideally I would like to go for 2 months maximum. I'm sure I would be very useful on the mountain, but without having personal connections it feels impossible to break into anything unless I'm willing to commit to an entire season. I have considered ski instructing, but I'm not qualified so this would be probably AUD$20k+ (flights to NZ, exams, etc) that I would rather avoid! I already have so much experience in hospitality and other areas, I'd rather stick to what I'm good at.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and actually done it? Is there any point pursuing this? Any advice is appreciated, thanks. :)",0,1742099910.0,movingtojapan,5,0.5,False

I had driven 60 miles on the highway, no issue. OBD2 live data had the ECT at the usual 192-198.

Stopped for coffee, fired up and 5-7 minutes later I notice the battery icon in the dash flash, I looked at the live data; ECT 230! Turn the music down and I can hear a squeal.

Immediately pull over, shut off. Pop the hood, no steam or weird smells, nothing leaking, coolant full, engine oil level fine.

Live data now has the ECT at 204 after the engine was off for a couple minutes.

Allow it to cool to 190, facetime my mechanic friend, he gets me to start it for just a few seconds, squeal is back and the belt isn‚Äôt turning.

He assumes that either a bearing has seized or a tensioner pulley is too tight (I last touched one 12k miles and two years ago when I did the alternator).

So the problem will get diagnosed at the mechanic. Will see.

I‚Äôm looking for a field that will get me out of restaurants. My dream is to open my own place one day, but I‚Äôm tired of working for other people in this industry and the extreme stress that comes with it, so I need a break. I am 25 and have been doing food service management since I was 17, working in it since I was 15. 


An idea of my skills:
I have worked in both small mom and pop fine dining establishments, up to large corporate hotel chains. I have experience running all kinds of restaurants as well as bars and cafes. Obviously I can serve and bartend but I‚Äôm trying to avoid that. I have managed staff sizes of up to 30 people. I am well versed in payroll using multiple softwares, hiring, disciplinary actions, training, coaching, and scheduling. I have great Excel skills, and have done the bookkeeping for quite a few businesses I‚Äôve worked for, including using programs like Quickbooks. I have picked up lots of odds and ends skills like tons of knowledge of restaurant machinery (also sold restaurant machinery for a couple years), extensive wine knowledge, and how to fix coffee equipment. I have great people skills and customer service skills. I‚Äôve done all of the marketing, graphic design, and social media for several places I‚Äôve worked for. And finally I‚Äôve done a ton of cash handling, deposits, etc. 


What fields should I be looking at? I am currently making around 60k per year and need to stay within that range. I have a degree in business management as well. ",1,1742099586.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

So I decided to write all of my thoughts about it in a post, so that ya'll could be bothered by it too. üòÜ lol","Ok so I'm just gonna spill out EVERYTHING that I have noticed from all of the footage that we have been shown so far. And it is actually a LOT. So grab your coffee, or your bong, or whatever helps you to get in the right frame of mind... cuz we are about to go down the rabbit hole with all this! 

So starting all the way back in the 1st game... there were a few characters that mention how we might be living in a multiverse, and how the Beaches might connect them, or have something to do w/it all. This topic is mentioned rather casually, and because the game has already thrown SO much information at the player by this point, it's quite easy for somebody to just dismiss it as mere speculation, move on & forget about it. 

But I have noticed a lot of weird stuff in all of the trailer footage & sneak peeks that we have been shown concerning the sequel game, and I gotta say that at THIS point... the multiverse or Alternate Earth theory, is the only one making any sense to me right now. Like for example:

How we have seemingly been shown different versions of the main characters:

There's the ""old man Sam"" version of the character that we have seen a few times, right?! But there's ALSO other ""versions"" of Sam it seems like too, such as a younger, short haired version, (this one's probably just a flashback though), as well as the current day, brown haired Sam from the 1st game. But now in the most recent trailer... we see a Sam that has jet BLACK hair too for some reason?!

I know Sam ain't out here using store bought hair dye in the Apocalypse! ü´£ü§£üñ§ Say it ain't so! 

There's also different ""versions"" of several other characters as well. Rainy looks different in multiple scenes & in different trailers, for example:

In one of the trailers (and in a sneak peek), she has longer hair, seems more mature, and is PREGNANT. But in the latest trailer, she seems younger, has shorter hair, and doesn't appear to be pregnant or a Mother at all. 

And normally, I would just assume that the footage of her where she appears younger, is merely a flashback. However... nobody ELSE around her looks any different! And in the early character posters that got released, Rainy's poster said ""Where Am I?"", which I've always found to be very strange. 

I THINK the ""where"" mentioned in the poster, also ties into to the multiverse/alternate Earth theory as well, but... I'm getting too ahead of myself.

Because we gotta talk about ""Tomorrow"", and how sometimes, we see the version of her that we were 1st introduced to, who has those ""strands"" attached to her or whatever. But then at other times ... you don't see those strands at all! 

We ALSO see the Tomorrow who comes out of that cocoon, who has jet black hair as well! Now I didn't think anything strange about the black hair at 1st, because I figured they just hadn't washed out all of the Tar & Chirilium yet. But what if THAT Tomorrow really does have black hair?! I'm starting to 2nd guess that her hair was just ""dirty"" ... now that I've seen a Sam who has jet black hair too.

Plus, while we have long speculated that Tomorrow is actually Baby Lou, but aged up 20yrs (they even have matching birthmarks)... that might not be the ONLY version of Baby Lou that we've seen either. Because let's not forget the trailer where we hear Lou's laugh coming out of the Red Samuari! ü§Ø HOW?! 

Could there be a dimension or an alternate Earth, where after Lou ""died"" her Ka (soul) went into the body of this Red Samuari, INSTEAD OF becoming Tomorrow?! And that's not all...

There also seems to be at least 2 Fragiles:

First, there is the Fragile who we see caring for & trying to protect, Baby Lou. I believe this is the same Fragile who we see kissing Sam in the latest trailer as well. But then we've also seen a Fragile who is the captain of the Magellan ship, wears a beret hat everywhere, and smokes cigarettes & sh*t. lol 

THAT Fragile, doesn't appear to have ever been around an infant, let alone cared for one! And so I'm sorry to say this, but she don't pass the ""vibe check""... and I think that might be, because she is NOT the same Fragile that we have always known.

And aside from seeing all these different versions of the characters... we also seem to be getting shown different versions of EVENTS as well! 

We have been shown at least a few different versions of the attack on Fragile & Baby Lou:

In the very 1st teaser trailer, we saw the shelter where Fragile & Lou were staying at, be broken into by the goons from that ""mysterious faction"". We see Fragile running away with Lou on her unicycle, until the goons catch up to them, shoot at them, causing them to crash the bike. 

And all of these events happen during the daylight hours, right?! Well, I always thought that it was really weird that in the very next scene (of the SAME trailer), it cuts to Fragile & Lou lying on the ground injured & possibly dying... at NIGHT TIME. ü§îüî• And there is also fire all around them too! Something is mighty fishy with that editing job. 

And then in the latest pre-order trailer... 

We see Fragile & Baby Lou being attacked in broad daylight again, except that this time, it NEVER cuts to night time during the attack scene! And instead of them borh lying on the ground already shot, injured & dying..., we see Fragile trying to ""jump"" both of them outta there, until she realizes that she can only jump Lou out by herself, before being shot & probably(?) killed.

Folks... I think we are being shown clips from completely DIFFERENT attack events, because they all totally contradict one another! And ALL of this stuff is why I think we might be dealing with alternative dimensions/Earths. 

Because aside from alllllll of the weird stuff that I have already mentioned... there's ALSO the scenes we see of Sam walking outside in locations where there is some crazy stuff going on, that we could NOT see, on our own home planet. I mean, in one of the shots, there is a gigantic Nebula up in space ffs. And in another shot, we see that the Moon looks absolutely MASSIVE in the sky, as if it is incredibly close to the planet. There ain't no way those locations are here on OUR Earth, sooo... üåé‚ÅâÔ∏è

Could we be seeing a Sam that is from another dimension's version of Earth, which is located somewhere ELSE in the cosmos?? 

Sorry to ramble, but I got ADD, and so eventually, my mind starts racing about all of this stuff, and I just gotta talk about it with somebody else, or I feel like I'm gonna explode. Haha There is SO much to discuss! I didn't even get into all of the fishy dialogue we hear some of these characters say either! Like when Fragile tells Sam that ""Death will never separate us"" ... as if she has been dead for the whole game! Or like when Tomorrow tells Rainy that babies aren't born the same way ""where I came from"". üò≥ WTF??

Ya'll gotta have some theories of your own!

I can't be the ONLY one obsessing over this.

So spill out your theories on here too, and let's put our heads together & share ideas, to see what we can deduce about this upcoming sequel. The release date cannot get here soon enough!",1,1742099477.0,DeathStranding,8,0.67,False

4:20 2 more large clots, cramps getting worse again

5:00-7:45 nap time. mild- mod cramping

7:45- Carrie scene while walking to bathroom after nap. One more large clot. Straight into shower. 

8:00- all cleaned up, mild cramping, still heavily bleeding

9:00- eat late supper, feeling mostly normal, very mild cramping, moderate-heavy bleeding

The pencil glided across the page, sketching lines she wasn‚Äôt fully conscious of. A pair of eyes‚Äîdeep, intense, familiar‚Äîbegan to take shape. She paused, staring at them, her fingers tightening around the pencil.

Why was she drawing *him* again?

With an exasperated sigh, Meera shut her sketchbook and pushed it aside, reaching for her coffee. It had gone cold. She should‚Äôve left an hour ago, but something about this bookstore caf√© always made her stay longer than she intended. Maybe it was the nostalgia. Maybe it was the comfort of silence.

Or maybe, deep down, she was still waiting for something. Someone.

The door chime rang. The sound was ordinary, the kind she‚Äôd heard a hundred times. But something in the air shifted‚Äîsubtle, heavy, unmistakable.

She didn‚Äôt want to look up.

Her fingers curled around the cup as she kept her gaze down, pretending to focus on absolutely nothing. But her heartbeat betrayed her, hammering in her chest as though her body had recognized him before her mind could.

A few hesitant steps. The pause of someone watching. The unspoken weight of a moment stretched between years.

Meera inhaled sharply. Don‚Äôt be ridiculous. It could be anyone.

But she *knew*.

And so, she looked up.

And there *he* was.

***Aarav Malhotra.***

Standing at the entrance of the caf√©, watching her with the same unreadable eyes she had once spent years trying to decipher.

Her grip on the coffee cup tightened. She had imagined this moment before‚Äîcountless times, in countless ways. Sometimes, she would bump into him on a rainy street. Sometimes, they would meet at an art gallery, his words hanging between them like an unfinished poem. But reality had a way of stealing away rehearsed moments.

Because right now, she couldn‚Äôt think of a single thing to say.

He looked different, yet exactly the same. The sharp suit, the effortless confidence‚Äîhe carried himself like a man who knew the weight of his own name. But his eyes... those hadn‚Äôt changed.

And they were still looking at her like she was a story he had left unfinished.

Aarav took a slow step forward. ""*Meera*.""

Her name on his lips sent a shiver down her spine. It was unfair how easily he could still do that to her.

She swallowed. ""*Aarav*.""

His lips quirked up slightly‚Äîan almost-smile, hesitant, unsure. ""It‚Äôs been a while.""

""Has it?"" she said, forcing a casual tone, though her pulse betrayed her. ""Didn‚Äôt notice.""

Aarav chuckled softly. ""Liar.""

The word hung between them, heavy with things unsaid.

She should say something else. Something distant, indifferent. But instead, all she could do was stare at him, wondering how years could change everything and yet leave some things untouched.

Aarav glanced at the chair across from her. ""May I?""

Meera hesitated. She could say no. She could get up and walk away, pretend that she didn‚Äôt care, that she hadn‚Äôt spent years wondering what if?

But she didn‚Äôt.

Instead, she nodded.

And just like that, a *new chapter began.*

The city had changed.

Mumbai‚Äôs skyline stretched higher, its streets pulsed with life, and yet, as Aarav stepped out of his sleek black car, he felt like he had stepped into a memory rather than a place. The bookstore caf√© stood just as it had years ago‚Äîtucked into a quiet corner of Colaba, filled with the scent of old pages and freshly brewed coffee.

Aarav had built an empire of words‚Äîhis name was stamped on bestselling novels, his media house dictated headlines, and his words had the power to shape narratives. But today, none of that mattered. Today, he wasn‚Äôt the celebrated ***Aarav Malhotra***\*.\* He was just a man walking toward a past he had never truly left behind.

And there she was.

***Meera*** sat by the window, lost in her sketchbook. Her dark hair was tied in a messy bun, strands falling loose around her face. She still had the same quiet intensity, the same way of disappearing into her own world. But there was something else‚Äîa weight in her eyes, an absence in her presence.

Aarav stood frozen at the doorway, a thousand unsaid words pressing against his throat.

She hadn‚Äôt seen him yet.

A part of him wanted to turn back, to leave before she looked up and shattered whatever illusion he had carried all these years. But another part of him‚Äîthe part that had regretted letting her go‚Äîknew he couldn‚Äôt.

Kids are 21, 18 and 11. We‚Äôd like a blend of nature, adventure and a few days by the pool. 

My thought was to fly from US to San Jose, and immediately catch a flight to Corcovado. 

Spend 2 days exploring the park down south, then renting a car, driving up the coast, stop for a couple of nights at Playa Tortuga or Manuel Antonio. Swim, and see some more nature. 

Then, drive north again to an all inclusive relaxing spot on the Nicoya peninsula. Relax by the pool and day trip. 

Spend the last day or two visiting Arenal before returning to San Jose to fly home. 

I get the impression that Corcovado will provide a taste of nature with less tourists.  It seems that it is a gem of a destination that would be a mistake to miss. 

Is it worth considering the trip without the journey to Corcovado, and enjoying the plenty of adventure to find up north?

Along with rainforest animal watching, we‚Äôd like a day zip-lining, maybe rafting, maybe a coffee plantation. I don‚Äôt want to plan too much so we are exhausted. 

Any suggestions or advice appreciated. ",2,1742098879.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False

I brew with either a V60 if I'm feeling enterprising, or a Behmor Brazen if I'm feeling lazy.

Grinder-wise, I just switched from an Oxo Brew to my old Baratza Sette (from my espresso days) with the S2 burrs.

And so far, I'm getting decent coffee! The thing I prize is clarity of flavor; I want my coffee to be sweet and juicy. And my coffee is... some of the time? Much of the time? Insofar as I have any ""problems"", I think it's that my coffee is... kinda boring.

So I'm thinking about a grinder upgrade, but honestly... I don't know what to expect. So I guess I have some questions:

1. Can I get really great coffee out of either of my current grinders?
2. What can I expect from a ""better"" grinder?
3. What grinders should I be looking at?
4. Can I get better coffee without spending $1k?

It just doesn‚Äôt work. And I can‚Äôt have built up a tolerance because I barely drink energy drinks. The only time I felt something was a year ago when I had my first energy drink, being monster energy drink. It felt great. I felt a rush. The 2nd time I felt nothing.

Before energy drinks, I used to drink coffee, but barely. I started at 17. The coffee did nothing the first time I had a double espresso shot. Nothing works and I just don‚Äôt understand. Redbull and monster taste like juice and it has 0 effect. I don‚Äôt even feel a crash.

Is my caffeine metabolism just extremely high, or is this adhd or something? Because I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else‚Äôs caffiene system like this. 

If it‚Äôs adhd then some of the things in my life would definitely make sense. But there‚Äôs a chance my body just metabolizes caffeine at an insane rate. I just wish I could use caffeine as an energy potion like everyone else ",1,1742098594.0,energydrinks,2,1.0,False
