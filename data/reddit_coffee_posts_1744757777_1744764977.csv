My stomach was fine after a week of antibiotics, and after three weeks following a strict diet, the doctor told me that I could introduce new foods in moderation (I could have a little bit of soda and coffee every week, for example).
Today I had a mini coke at lunch, and a really small chocolate bar as a dessert. Not really sure if that‚Äôs the cause, but I now have mucus and blood in my stool. This wasn‚Äôt happening since the last time I went to ER, and was diagnosed with Colitis.

I‚Äôm really new to this. Will the blood disappear if I change my diet, or should I go to the doctor again? ",1,1744764816.0,UlcerativeColitis,0,1.0,False

Yes I knew the MOS I chose was known to be one of the most avoided and overworked MOSs but I didn't imagine it was this bad and plus working on military technology and getting some experience for when I got back to the civilian workforce seemed like a good idea. I don't remember the last time I slept 5 hours and I don't know how much longer I can keep living like this until I collapse. I don't drink coffee because I'm a very nervous and anxious person when on caffeine and I think it would just worsen my life quality even more.
Still got two more years to go before I finish my contract and get the F out of here or reclass to another MOS.

I have put my professional career on hold to avoid expensive childcare, make sure all the household duties get done, and to support my family. My spouse has a greater earning capacity so it makes sense.

Yesterday, all 3 kids were home. It's school holidays so the 5 year old is home too. I couldn't go anywhere because I was waiting for a plumber to come over. We had been without water for about 24 hours by this stage so dishes and laundry had fallen far behind (doesn't take long for those things to get out of control with 3 kids). So I couldn't get the kids out of the house for fun activities, couldn't get any groceries, and struggled to get the 1 year old down for a nap because the other kids were running around stir crazy making loads of noise. My partner got home not long after the plumber had left and I had ordered some pizza to be delivered. I had already started 1 load on in the dishwasher. I expressed to my spouse that I would like to go to the gym tonight because I was cooped up all day. We finished dinner and got the kids to bed. I went out to do a late night grocery shop while my partner stayed home and relaxed in the bath. 

We have an indoor cat that had recently escaped and we've been trying to track down ever since. One of our neighbours said the cat was under their house so my partner went out to try to lure the cat out while I stayed home in case the kids needed me. I ended up falling asleep (almost 11pm by this stage). My partner woke me up to tell me they were disappointed that I hadn't done housework while they were out, told me to go to the gym and come straight home to bed, don't do any housework tonight because I need to be well rested enough tomorrow to coparnet with them. I drive to the gym but didn't go in, I just turned around and came straight back home and went to sleep. I was exhausted and half asleep.

I got up today at 6am for the 1 year old, did all the usual things of preparing lunches, making breakfast, getting the kids dressed, made my spouse breakfast and coffee and left it beside the bed, in additon to tidying up and doing the dishes. At 9am I woke my partner up. They gave the breakfast I made them to the kids, which got them covered in food. Now they've taken the kids to play at the park so I can get out of my negative headspace (my partners choice, not mine).

I don't know. I think I'm doing my best but my partner makes me feel like I'm being lazy.",1,1744764672.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1k07uou,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1k07uou/my_take_on_the_dress_code_policy_venti_rant/,My take on the dress code policy (venti rant),"Apologies for the word vomit nature of this post I‚Äôm just in the middle of a shit shift and needed a Venti rant as you guys say around here.

The dress code is horrible, annoying, and unfair to those who are no longer allowed to wear the coffee gear that they have purchased over the years. But I think that this is a symptom of a larger issue with how the company as a whole views its ‚Äúpartners‚Äù
With the unrealistic expectation of every single cup having a personalized message written on it (it also ruins the fun of writing on cups since they‚Äôre meaningless if every cup gets a message) and rumors (at least at my store) that hours are being heavily cut to protect the company‚Äôs bottom line when we‚Äôre already dealing with a skeleton crew during evenings. The union busting and finally the dress code restrictions. Not to mention providing a private jet to the CEO so he didn‚Äôt have to relocate, it‚Äôs clear to all of us that the company that we prop up with our labor has abandoned us.

That has probably been true for a while now, but that philosophy is finally starting to rear its head as more and more decisions are made that make our jobs harder or more miserable to do. Truthfully I really started to feel the consequences of these choices last year when Starbucks went through their PR nightmare during the Israel/Hamas protests. They‚Äôve been trying to push this ‚Äúauthentic coffee house experience‚Äù in order to lure all the customers they pushed away‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre the ones who have to take the fall and suffer the consequences of the poor decisions that they have made as a company.

In all honesty, if all we were dealing with was a new dress code I wouldn‚Äôt care that much. Outside of not permitting old coffee gear, it‚Äôs not that bad and there‚Äôs still room and time for them to go back and allow the coffee gear with feedback (not that they‚Äôd listen). But that‚Äôs not all we‚Äôre dealing with. It‚Äôs the unrealistic expectations, the understaffing, and the blatant disregard for our work experience. There was a time I used to enjoy working here. Maybe it had more to do with who was there and not the job itself but I can‚Äôt help but feel like my tolerance for this job is quickly fading.

Anyways I‚Äôm about üëåthis close to quitting hahahaha‚Ä¶

TLDR: The dress code is one of many examples of how little corporate values the people actually making them profit

I decided to in way I guess, ‚Äòstart out small‚Äô in ways of ‚Äòknowing‚Äô good things would start happening for me in the little ways. Of course I want my big goals - a nice house someday, gf / wife, dream car, etc; everyone can relate or wants the same too. I don‚Äôt want to say it‚Äôs all far fetched but it also won‚Äôt happen either way over night but a few certain events have happened to me the past week from every day I‚Äôve been thinking about the bright side of things. 

‚Ä¢ one morning on my way to work, I always stop to get coffee for $2.26. I told The cashier one morning last Saturday ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll pay with cash today not card if it‚Äôs cool.‚Äù He said yeah youre good man - I go to pull cash out and he reinstates himself saying ‚Äúhey man you‚Äôre good (as in saying it was free).‚Äù
I responded asking if he‚Äôs sure as he said yes and I told him thank you and went about my day.
‚Ä¢ Friday last week I was eating my lunch but ended up not packing enough food thinking to myself ‚Äúwell I wish I had more to eat but I‚Äôll live until I get home.‚Äù Ironically a few minutes later sitting next to my coworker, she offers me her wings / fries she got from the food truck because she said she didn‚Äôt like the way they tasted and gave them to me & I said thank you so much. 
‚Ä¢ today at work I got appraisal for getting a lot of extra stuff done with barely anything going south or sideways / wrong basically and it made me feel good about myself. 

Of course after and before all these events (even in between), better things have just been happening for me more and more it seems like but just in the small ways.

Notice how many times the word ‚ÄúI‚Äù appears.,"This past week has been emotionally exhausting. Thursday at Harris Hospital, Virginia didn‚Äôt even recognize me. I was crushed. Shocked. Heartbroken.

After nearly 37 years since we first met when I was a contract employee at CSC working in Security, Virginia was the mother figure I had never had. Saying goodbye to her will also be the hardest experience of loss I‚Äôve endured in this lifetime.

TDCJ Scheduled and Confirmed dates so far are June 8- Jester 3. June 9- Allred Unit. June 15- Jordan Unit. July 20- Robertson Unit.

Federal Clients- Please be aware that pre Covid guidelines have been lifted. Contact weddings are in place. Wedding rings valued at less than $100 are allowed. Currently, no guests are allowed.

ICE- No guests are allowed. Covid guidelines are still in place.

County- Tarrant County is still not allowing mobile notaries unless accompanied by an attorney. Parker County will not notarized absentee affidavits for inmates in federal custody.

All other counties- there are no further issues I‚Äôm aware of. If you encounter issues, contact me.

With Virginia dying and while trying to clean out the condo I bought and furnished, as usual, my niece, Stephaney yet again chose the worst POSSIBLE time SHE COULD to CHOOSE to relapse.

Addicts don‚Äôt care. I know you‚Äôre reading this Stephaney and probably too high to understand it BUT goodbye. You made your choice.

For the first time in 17 years I thought and believed I had YOU finally stable. The moment I used the money YOU had given me every few days to keep you from blowing it on drugs in order for you to save up to buy a car for 6 months, YOU went straight to your dealer and were off the rails on meth YET again.

Don‚Äôt call me Steph. I have nothing and I mean nothing to say to you. I will not help you again other than to buy a bus ticket to CA. Go be homeless in Venice Beach.

I‚Äôve devoted 17 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars for YOUR treatment, bonds and more for you to trying to save you WHILE also financially helping Cindy raise the twins with NO child support whatsoever from you or that idiot, Michael Wayne Scherer Jr and I‚Äôm officially DONE. Your MOM is done too. Leave us alone.

Addicts are sociopaths. They are completely devoid of empathy and compassion for family members that their behavior victimizes. If you disagree with this statement, you either don‚Äôt have a family member with addiction issues who HAS destroyed any degree of normality in YOUR life OR you are an addict yourself. I hate drugs. I especially cannot tolerate addicts.

For over a year now, my niece, YOU Stephaney have been living at group home. The rent is $650 a month. It‚Äôs about 7-9 minutes from my West Fort Worth home. The group home isn‚Äôt in the luxurious neighborhood I live in. You ‚Äúhate living with 8-10 other women. You want your own apartment. You wanted a car. You. You. You.‚Äù

They don‚Äôt have group home‚Äôs in Westover Hills. Group homes aren‚Äôt in $600-900k neighborhoods.

You didn‚Äôt like the location of the Group Home. Too bad. You had nowhere else to go. I would think after being homeless, in jail or in a psych ward 17 times during a two year window while trying to find you a job that you would appreciate having a place to live that someone else (your mother and I) were paying for. But nope not you. You never appreciate anything. You wouldn‚Äôt know TRUE sacrifice if it slapped you in the face. Sociopaths have no idea what sacrifice is.

I paid YOUR rent for months. I looked everywhere to find you a job. I drove you to AND from Jason‚Äôs until you started acting crazy and got fired again from using. Yes I called Angela at the Group Home to have you committed and dried out again. Not Cindy. Me. I did this to keep you from getting kicked out and dry you out. You are a stark raving lunatic on meth. Ask anyone. Ask coworkers at Jason‚Äôs or the other great job I got FOR you at Lucilles you screwed up. You think no one knows when you are using. EVERYONE KNOWS.

Then I find you a job at Charlestons where you were making more money than you did at Jason‚Äôs. Enough to pay a few months of your own rent for the FIRST time in your 34 year life.

Your mother and I were paying our own rent at 16 years old. Not in a beautiful neighborhood either. In a very dangerous area because we couldn‚Äôt afford a nice apartment in a nice area. Do you know what? We were thankful to have running water and a roof over our heads back then you EVEN though WE COULD not afford electricity for the THREE YEARS we lived there you ungrateful jackass.

You‚Äôre welcome you never appreciate anything. You never have and you never will. You care about getting high more than anything else in your life. You could have been married. You could have had a normal life. You could have SPARED this entire family from your destructive choices and yet over and over you have hurt us. We are sick and tired of your sociopathic tendencies, name calling and never accepting responsibility for your own actions.

I‚Äôve drove you to work or let you use my Uber App when you got that job at Charlestons since you suddenly considered yourself ‚Äútoo good‚Äù to ride the bus. I worked so damn hard to get you at that upscale restaurant.

You have been fired from nearly every other restaurant in Fort Worth AND Weatherford for acting crazy on meth. You did that. We didn‚Äôt. We have screamed, cried and begged you to stay clean. You have consistently chosen not to do so.

A year and half ago BEFORE your two years back on the streets homeless and whacked out, you DELIBERATELY lied and said you were never using again. Cindy and I had as usual just picked you up from yet another psych ward ‚Äústint‚Äù because your behavior on meth leads police to believe you are crazy rather than high and experiencing meth induced psychosis.

You lied all the way to that apartment and then snuck off through the apartment complex after YOU lied to Cindy and I telling us YOU needed rent money to and that you were planned and were going to apply at Mexican Inn the following day and THEN you ran off with the rent money we GAVE to you in good faith choosing to be a homeless drug addict.

I cannot believe what you put us through over and over and over. My health has suffered. Cindys health has suffered and not one but both your twin daughters have attempted suicide BECAUSE OF YOU.

Not that you would care but since Cindy gave up on you during that 2 year window of you running off with the so called ‚Äúrent money‚Äù we gave to you, Cindy wasn‚Äôt looking for you I was.

Cindy even told our dear friend, Sherri that ‚Äúshe was lucky her meth addicted son died sparing her ALL of the shit that we have been through trying to save you and MEANT IT.‚Äù

Sherri was shocked but Sherri hasn‚Äôt been through 17 years of this crap. She only had one year of it.

Your mother told me not to look for you but I refused to give up. I spent those 2 years searching for YOU when I wasn‚Äôt working in very dangerous areas.

Your mom spent those two years crying and heartbroken not knowing if you were dead or alive WHILE trying to act normal and raise your kids you selfish fuck.

When I did find YOU, you were out of YOUR mind AND living in a cardboard box. The police had called me because I gave up trying to find you myself and finally filed a missing persons report.

Fort Worth PD actually told me ‚Äúnot to try and come get you because you were out of your mind on meth.‚Äù YET Fort Worth PD also refused to take you to the JPS psych ward because they knew you were NOT out of your mind AND/OR mentally ill but instead high on meth. They left your ass in that box. I should have listenned to them and soared subjecting myself AND your daughter finding you that day. I wish I had.

You may have forgotten that night while living in a cardboard box that I had your daughter, Maryssa in my suv seeing you like that. Screaming and crawling out of that box COMPLETELY out of your mind. You wouldn‚Äôt go to treatment. We BOTH begged you. Even the police wouldn‚Äôt transfer you to the psych ward.

Have you ever wondered why Maryssa was with me? She was with me because she TRULY believed that if I found you that if she was with me that SHE could convince you to go into treatment. You screamed at your own daughter that you were Jesus Christ and she was Satan.

Do you THINK any of us have forgotten the things you‚Äôve done and said to hurt us? News flash- we haven‚Äôt. We can‚Äôt. We never will.

I went back to that GD box every day I wasn‚Äôt traveling to meet clients to look for you and drop off food and clothing for a solid month. You never went back after you were found there. A month later, rather than you living in that bud and benefitting from everything I had left there thinking it was for you crying and humiliated, a man crawled out of that box instead.

Go be homeless somewhere, anywhere. I don‚Äôt want to find you shadow boxing light poles and acting stupid on Camp Bowie. The twins are terrified that you will show up in Weatherford and embarrass them at Cindy‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt. Cindy WILL call the police.

I spent 2 years when not working paying homeless people I showed your photo‚Äôs to trying to find you. TWO YEARS.

I wish I had left you in Oklahoma and let you do the 10-20. I wish I had. Getting you probation was the stupidest thing I have ever done. Those 3 years were the only time in your adult life you were ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Your children wouldn‚Äôt care what a maniac you are on drugs if they had NOT seen you off meth for those 3 years you were on paper and follicles. Go to prison. I wish you had failed those Damn hair follicles to spare all of us getting back on meth LESS than 24 hours after your probation removed hair follicles.

Meanwhile Cindy was struggling with high blood pressure and hypertension because of YOU. Cindy nearly died because I was trying to get you back in treatment when you got off that bus in Oklahoma we put you on to get you to treatment so we could go to work and then you called us to drive 6 hours one way to take you to rehab ourselves. You selfish POS. You NEVER once considered what you have put us through. Not ONE TIME.

We hate your screaming phone calls. We now record them. Why? Because we are going to call the police and stop you from terrorizing us with them and film from our house cameras to prove you are a threat to yourself and others.

My neighbors thought I was crazy or a fanatic for installing those 16 cameras ‚Äúin this neighborhood.‚Äù I knew I would need them with an out of control meth addict coming over here with a hammer. Were you planning to kill your #1 enabler. You know, ME?

The Fort Worth house is a compound of self defense. Don‚Äôt bring a hammer to a gun fight MF. You know damn well I know how to protect myself and my home AND I will.

Do you have any idea what seeing your OWN mother whacked out of their minds does to children? Tammy, Cindy and I do. Jerry was too young.

Maryssa will never forget seeing you crawling out of that box like a lunatic clawing at us like a monster.

We have tried to protect the twins from YOU. The very same children Cindy and I did everything humanly possible to give THEM the stable childhood WE didn‚Äôt have that you kept screwing up over and over and over with your outrageous and dangerous behavior.

No you don‚Äôt care and I doubt you EVER will care either. The only thing you care about is your next fix. You are the most selfish SOB I‚Äôve ever encountered in my entire life OTHER than MY OWN MOTHER.

During that two years of you being homeless and strung out where Cindys heart was literally breaking in Parker County, I found you once again while trying to find you (as usual) in my ‚Äúoff time.‚Äù Do you know what it‚Äôs like trying to find a maniac on meth to convince them to get help? I DO.

That day I saw you walking down Calmont waiving your hands around and talking to yourself would be the last time I wasted my time looking for you.

While I was wasting my time looking for you, crying my eyes from weariness and frustration along with my determination to fix you, AGAIN I begged you to go into treatment. BEGGED. You screamed at me and called me names and told me you hated me. I hate you. I hate everything you‚Äôve taken from me, my sister and this family. Cindy was right. Sherri was lucky.

If my other readers don‚Äôt know OR can‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like trying to save an addict WHILE raising their twin daughters for nearly 17 years, SPARE me your judgment about my language OR my transparency.

For everyone else who has lived through the nightmare of loving and trying to save an addict, I‚Äôm sure you can relate.

Someone I loved is NOW dying. The closest thing to a mother figure I have ever known doesn‚Äôt even recognize me. At the very same time- someone ELSE that I HAVE tried to save over and over, YOU Stephaney have YET AGAIN betrayed my trust for the last time. I will never ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you by enabling you AGAIN Stephaney.

Stephaney, I wish you were in prison. I wish I hadn‚Äôt saved you from prison in Oklahoma. I wish when I was trying to send you to what I thought was a treatment center in Georgia that when you were arrested on a revoked bond in Oklahoma at the Dallas Greyhound bus station where I was relieved we were going to get you out of Texas that you decided to get into a fist fight at after we left that the Dallas PD had taken you back to Oklahoma.

I wish I hadn‚Äôt paid that damn bond because I was so determined to get a year of treatment in another state and a year of your crap away from this family. You destroy everything. EVERYTHING.

I finally got you on that bus out of Texas and a week later YOU were back here terrorizing us AGAIN. ONE WEEK? All that money spent?

The amount of money I‚Äôve ‚Äúspent‚Äù trying to save YOU is staggering at nearly half a million dollars over these last 17 years but the financial pain coupled with the emotional abuse and many other things that YOU have done to this family are equally emotionally debilitating.

I can‚Äôt go through this again with YOU and I won‚Äôt.

Stephaney you gave your mother high blood pressure and heart attacks. I nearly lost my twin. The only time in 17 years that you have ever been clean was when you were on paper from Oklahoma that REQUIRED hair follicle testing. The minute they removed hair follicles you were right back on meth and right back to abusing, harassing and stalking us AND the twins.

Stephaney-have literally abused this entire family for 17 years. Go away. I don‚Äôt care where.

Your daughters have both attempted suicide OVER YOUR CHOICE to start using. Makenna will permanently suffer with heart damage and Serotonin Syndrome BECAUSE YOU CHOSE METH after those damn hair follicles were removed from the conditions of your probation.

That 3 years of sobriety earned the twins trust only for you to destroy it and leave those two innocent children blaming themselves and attempting suicide you piece of shit! I hate you.

How DARE you lead us and your own children to believe YOU would never get back on meth by lying to all of us that you would never use again during that three year window of probation that required hair follicles? Fuck you.

Last Friday after months of saving your money for you from that good paying job at Charleston,s that I found FOR you WHILE juggling my 4 businesses and client‚Äôs. You wouldn‚Äôt EVEN bother to find a job on your own. I had to do it for you.

THEN after months of paying all of your expenses for you after yet another expensive ‚Äústint‚Äù in treatment, you got into that $5k car and took off.

You didn‚Äôt even bother to let me take you or follow to go find insurance. You were too hellbent on finding meth again you psychotic bitch.

No thank you for the many months and nearly a year of helping to pay your rent, give you rides to work, find you a job not once but three times in 3 years because you started using at the other job and got fired again. No thank you for the cigarettes, meals, treatment facilities or YOUR coffee WHILE driving you to and from work everyday when I wasn‚Äôt out of town or the state working my events while you yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not riding the bus anymore give me access to Uber.‚Äù You are the most entitled and demanding little shit that I‚Äôve ever encountered.

Do you HAVE ANY idea how hard it is to walk into a prison or venue acting normal AND happy for MY clients with your mom and daughters crying because you are yet again terrorizing this family?

Do you know I worry every time I travel that you will show up at our houses or our friends houses OR how embarrassing our neighbors seeing you acting crazy is to US or your children?!!!! How expensive it is to fix kicked in doors? Holes punched in our walls? Covering deductibles because you‚Äôve stolen our cars, credit cards and checks WHILE raising your twin daughters and paying medical expenses over and over again at Mesa Springs for the twins because of your behavior? What about the treatments I‚Äôve paid over and over and over for your sorry ass?

Stephaney, you are the most selfish son of a bitch I‚Äôve ever encountered other than my own mother who was also a piece of shit.

The difference between you and OUR MOTHER is that YOU never had THE opportunity to SELL your children to YOUR dealer for $50 each like OUR MOTHER did to her FOUR CHILDREN. Do you know why YOU NEVER had the opportunity? Because I paid an attorney $20k to get custody of them and protect them from YOU your addiction.

We SAVED the twins from YOU. Stop saying we STOLE the TWINS from you. Idiot. You couldn‚Äôt take care of those kids for ten minutes.

Do you have any idea how much raising twins costs? Braces? Staying in expensive mental institutions because they‚Äôve seen you acting crazy and screaming she is Jesus Christ? Again, fuck you.

Our FB friends message Cindy and I constantly when YOU are off her meds and back on meth. ‚ÄúI saw Stephaney shadow boxing a light pole near El Fenix in Camp Bowie.‚Äù We BOTH tell them all to ‚Äúcall the police.‚Äù

Do you know how much money Cindy and I have spent buying ‚Äúpsyche ward friendly‚Äù clothing FOR YOU over and over and over. JPS would release you. You would start using again and get institutionalized again. We would buy more psych ward friendly clothing. Wear what they have we aren‚Äôt bringing you ANYTHING ever again in the nut house. We aren‚Äôt EVER coming to visit again and we aren‚Äôt ever helping you again. Help yourself MF.

I‚Äôm surprised as hell that I haven‚Äôt had a nervous breakdown or heart attack myself! Stephaney- 17 times at the nut house in a 3 year window AND consistently losing all of the shit we bought for YOU over and over?! You are outrageous. OUTRAGEOUS.

Guess what you selfish narcissist, WHILE we were running and buying psych ward friendly clothing and cigarettes ‚Äúbecause you could smoke at Sundance,‚Äù we were ALSO running to Mesa Springs where the twins were being treated for suicidal ideation because of YOU. Then we had to drive on to Wellbridge where dad was because he shot up his roof thinking someone was living in the attic.

You have NO IDEA the shit we have been through because of you AND dad. To Hell with both of you. Burn in Hell.

FOUR of our own family members in NUT HOUSES at the same time? TWO of you THAT we didn‚Äôt give a shit about were BOTH YOU and our DAD.

Yet Cindy and I were running to AND from our work and nut houses for a month while you and dad were committed at the same time as the twins.

Thanks for destroying nearly 20 years of our lives we can never get back. You life ruining bastard. You have no idea of the glass you have drug US and your children through.

Cindy‚Äôs neighbors don‚Äôt even talk to her BECAUSE your dumb ass antics that have forced us to call the police over and over and over again have embarrassed the entire family over there.

Walking back and forth across Cindy‚Äôs roof screaming you were Jesus as we rolled into the driveway with Makenna hanging her head in shame and running into the house after hours of STAAR testing to keep from seeing you YET AGAIN out of your mind on Meth terrorizing Cindy, the twins, Leigh Ann and baby Maddy? Your sister can never forgive you for the things you have said, done and taken from her. Neither can my son. Don‚Äôt call Leigh Ann or Robert. They are done too. Unlike you they have families and a normal life. Leave them alone.

Cindy and I survived the shittiest childhood ever. That‚Äôs right I said said survived. As you are well aware, our mother was the most miserable excuse for a human being I‚Äôve ever encountered UNTIL YOU. Don‚Äôt give me your guilt trip B.S. ever again about how hard your life was because drug dealers beat you up.

Hey Steph- STOP bring stupid and blaming others BECAUSE you put yourself in those situations not us.

I never thought I could hate anyone as much as I hate our mom. But you changed that. After selling all 4 of her children for $50 each to her Heroin dealer who (not knowing what to do with us), locked us in a closet together for 7-12 days starving and urinating and crying in the dark. There was a latch on the outside of that door making it impossible for us to leave on our own. No one was looking for us. The smells alerted other neighbors to what they believed was a dead body which turned out to be 10 year old Tammy our step sister, 6 year old twins (Cindy and I) and two year old Jerry our baby brother. Cindy had cried so hard and so long out of fear and hunger that she required an emergency hernia surgery. We survived. We never used drugs because we hated drugs. You and your stupid choices have forced us to endure a childhood AND an adulthood of dealing with a piece of shit addict. I can‚Äôt wait for our mother to die so I can stop using the energy it takes to hate her for her choices.

You HAVE rarely heard me talk about ‚Äúthe rest of my family‚Äù because I don‚Äôt have anything good and much less positive to say. Our father didn‚Äôt want three children while grandma Tinney adopted and saved Tammy.

Our father wanted to drink and party so he left us with his father who once Tammy was safely out of the picture, began sexually abusing my twin sister and I just as he had Tammy. No one protected us from grandpa. No one. Not dad, not grandma not aunt Shirley. No one would save us. We RAN to save ourselves.

When Cindy and I ran away at 15, baby brother Jerry was left behind. Poor Jerry alone with a wicked stepmother and a violent father. Every time I hear ‚Äúoh what a lonely boy‚Äù I think of our baby brother and I cry.

You wanna know where Cindy and I came from? We ran from the gates of Hell that you and your behavior drug us right back into.

The police found Cindy and I eating out of a trash can behind 7-11 at 15 years old and took us to the shelter. We were thankful to be off the streets but nothing you. You love being homeless you idiot.

I was pregnant after being raped and lost the baby shortly thereafter. We lived at Womens Haven for about a year before a church donated us a car.

We also lived in that car for another year taking births baths at area gas stations until we could save up to rent an apartment. Cindy and I both lied about our ages to get waitress jobs to keep from starving. Cindy was followed home one night while I was working late at Red Lobster. She worked at IHOP. These two men pushed her into the apartment and raped then assaulted her. I came home to find my bloody and battered twin sister on the living room floor beside the $10 sofa we had tied to the top of our donated car to bring home and have somewhere to sit. She never saw their faces. Stephaney you have no fucking idea where we have been, what we have been through OR what we have survived. You selfish idiot.

Your sister, Leigh Ann is the child of that rape. We didn‚Äôt even know Cindy was pregnant until a car hit us and she was told she was pregnant in the ER. This shocking development was a deal between us. I had lost a baby she had gained one. We would raise her together and forget how she got here. We would also ‚Äúmidnight move‚Äù from our dark apt in the middle of the night to an all bills paid apt about 3 miles away.

Never once did our father, grandmother or aunt offer to help us in any way. We had no one. Only each other. You have always had Cindy and I. You don‚Äôt anymore. You are dead to us.

You have stolen everything you could from this family. You had no excuses. You didn‚Äôt live our shitty childhood. You weren‚Äôt abused. You never went hungry. We raised all of you as a team. Even when you were screwing around and got pregnant, we weren‚Äôt upset. We would deal with it. We would financially handle it.

We didn‚Äôt ask you for anything other than to be a decent human being and get off drugs. PERIOD. That‚Äôs it. Their entire lifetime you have been a fucked up out of control lunatic on drugs. Cindy and I were all you had left. I refused to give up on you but NO MORE. Go away. Far away.

My first husband was violent as was your mothers. We didn‚Äôt even know or realize that violence wasn‚Äôt normal. We had grown up in very violent and abusive conditions. But once we did it was too late. Cindy was pregnant with YOU.

You (according to your Deadbeat dad, Larry Mahaney) were ‚Äúsupposed to be a boy.‚Äù

Your miserable excuse of a father never forgave Cindy for having a girl and within 2 years had another entire family.

Cindy was visiting me in San Clemente with you and Leigh Ann when a message on my home recorder from Larry stated ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bother coming home. There‚Äôs nothing left here. None of the girls clothes or toys, none of your personal items. Nothing. You should have had a boy.‚Äù

Leigh Ann was always a good baby. You never were. You were fussy and by 6 acting in a violent fashion towards your sister and my son. We couldn‚Äôt find out why until you were diagnosed as bipolar AND absolutely refused to take your medication.

Your sorry sack of shit father, Larry ‚Äúskirted‚Äù child support by non servicing Cindy of the court date and claiming to have custody of YOU.

Your mother has raised NOT one but TWO generations of children with no child support whatsoever. I AM a workaholic BECAUSE I‚Äôm the only one other than her husband who had always taken care of Cindy, you, Leigh Ann and the twins financially and emotionally.

You DON‚ÄôT KNOW hardship or sacrifice. You never have. Save that ‚Äúsorry‚Äù shit for another sucker. Sorry is a word I would love to never hear again.

By 14 or 15, you were hanging with a rough crowd. By 15.5, she you were pregnant with twins. By 16 you were on meth ‚Äúto control your weight.‚Äù

Had I not hired an attorney, the state would‚Äôve taken the twins.

Cindy and I SAVED the twins at 40 years old. Stop saying we stole them you stupid ass. We saved them. We saved them from being drug into crack houses and sexually abused by your crackhead friends. You would have endangered them the same way our mother did to us.

For years Cindy and I have tried to save YOU and WE give up. You even stole Leigh Ann‚Äôs brand new computer, desk and chair that she saved up to buy for herself. You don‚Äôt care about anything except getting high.

YOU love meth more than the only two people who didn‚Äôt give up, me and your mom. Your ‚Äúgo to‚Äù enablers, Wendy and Cindy. Don‚Äôt come to us anymore. We are finished trying to save you. Save yourself.

Have a great life getting high or going to prison for your choices. I will NEVER bail you put again. I will never pay to get your towed car out of impound when you are arrested either and you will be you always are.

I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I won‚Äôt. Cindy had a heart attack when YOU relapsed and started using while we were in NY TWO DAYS to film with CBS.

You are just like our mother. The only difference is that Cindy and I protected the twins. No one protected us. We are the complete opposite of our mother and YOU. We gave you a good childhood. We have tried over and over to help you. The banks are closed.

We are the people we never had but you cannot cherry pick a withered branch from a cherry tree. We are out.

Good luck to you Steph. You will get pulled over. You will lose your car AGAIN just like you did 3 years ago after we spent thousands bonding it out because we aren‚Äôt going to bond your car OR you out.

Frankly, I wish you would go to prison. I wish I had let you go in Oklahoma an spared this family and especially your children from the things you‚Äôve said and done.

It‚Äôs time for you to experience tough love Steph and this time WE REALLY mean it‚Ä¶

1k07m8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k07m8w,4 days in NYC,"First of all, a HUGE thank you to this sub for helping me plan out the food spots on my recent trip (arguably the most important part of the itinerary). We went to 30 different places in 4 days counting caf√©s, bars, etc., but barely scratched the surface of what NYC has to offer.

Just thought I'd share some of my favourites!

1. Nightingale latte at Bird & Branch (Hell's Kitchen): 10/10 earl grey flavour. We stayed a block away, but I would've never known to come here otherwise.
2. Mushroom croissant & earl grey morning bun af Radio Bakery (Greenpoint): I would fly back just to get that mushroom croissant again, it was dreamy. We went on a Friday morning and the line moved pretty quickly.
3. Carrot cake at Hani's Bakery (East Village): This was my favourite sweet item of the trip. I'll have to go back for the cinnamon bun. 
4. Burrata & tartufo slices at L'Industrie (West Village): Deserves the hype and then some, phenomenal pizza. Honourable mention to Mama's Too for their square vodka slice.
5. Everything bagel with cream cheese at Apollo Bagels (East Village): I know this isn't traditional, but I loved the crunch and lightness of the sourdough. It was my favourite of all the bagels we tried (although definitely on the pricier side).
6. Malaysian style Milo french toast at Kopitiam (LES): So nostalgic and the flavours were on point. We were doing a Chinatown food crawl and didn't have room to order more here, but I'd love to go back and try their mains as well.
7. Happy hour at Sake no Hana (LES): One of the prettiest spaces I've been to, but the food held its own! Drinks tasted great (popping boba was fun), and all the small bites were seasoned perfectly. For $20 I honestly thought it was a steal.
8. Jiucai pancake + chocolate bolo bao at Win Son Bakery (East Village): Again, the hype didn't disappoint. I also didn't expect this to be as filling as it was‚ÄîI shared it with my friend and it was enough for both of us.
9. Coffee + pastries at Remi43 (Midtown East): beautiful space once again, but the lavender latte and matcha pound cake were top-tier. This was our last breakfast in NYC and I think we ended on a high note. 

The only miss on this trip was lunch at Misi (Williamsburg): ordered the occhi and tortelli and both felt quite one-note. We did sit at the kitchen counter which was fun, but I wasn't blown away by either the food or the service. I think I would try Torrisi or Don Angie next time for that ~fancy Italian restaurant in NYC~ experience.

Overall, fell in love with the East Village and could spend a whole month just eating in that area. I'll definitely be back for more, hopefully soon. Thank you once again r/FoodNYC!

I'll stop waiting at around 5pm of start date.
I plan to leave evening or early morning next day.
----

Context:
Realized that I've been slaving away at work too much and have been left behind regarding current events and the vibe in general - literally it's been a blur. I attended a wedding of one of my hs barkadas last week with me just fying in that morning (Friday) and then flying back to the metro the morning right after (Saturday) because I had meetings already set on Monday and some stuff needing my signature. My whole barkada went to vacation (they're still there) to a remote island and I see they've been having so much fun. I'm very ok with my situation tho, I am comfortable. Ngl, lowkey jealous of many people that can have time to be carefree.

Recently been musing that I want 2025 to be the year I finally have my ISBN - i would need time to relax, free my head, and write (poetry). I just need  quiet time to relax and a place that's peaceful.

Long weekend's here and I don't have plans yet. I can invest in time and maybe make these next 4 days a build up of foundation for great new friendships. Not really keen on a relationship, I may have crossed over the line already for any interest. I just want to get to know the younger crowd and feed off good energy. I have gotten to know that a lot of people younger have great insights in life, are yearning to build up themselves (which I find fascinating a topic for writing) and definitely know more about the local scene.

I would love to be kidnapped as an introvert by an extrovert.

7. At least a bit ok features please, be confident - has been investing in own health (running, gym, spin, etc.) Super bonus if you know ballet, tap dancing, golf, diving or any sport. I'd love to learn.
8. If this is you above, you probably don't need me in your life (lol) and that's very ok, would love to be part of it tho. Again i'll do my thing, you do yours - i would just like to be kidnapped at times in the future (e.g. late dinners/cofree, early morning runs, etc)
9. Please be around makati/bgc for easier logistics (just a preference)
10. Maybe become my wingman in the future? I love brutally honest and unapologetic people. Would be great if you can teach me about wines and sht.
11. Please don't be a serial killer, please do be interested in a lot of things tho (please just be a listener/watcher of hallyu not someone who stans..) and be very attentive to details

d. I just want some quiet time, i already have a friend like above but she went back to her province for a month to detox too. She also has her own group already.

e. Would love to start my own or find a partner in crime that's also very busy. we can learn from ea other and grow.

1k07k4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fit/comments/1k07k4p/i_ate_whatever_i_wanted_for_a_month_and_was_very/,I ate whatever I wanted for a month and was very surprised at the outcome.,"I‚Äôm 26 and I‚Äôve always taken fitness very seriously.  Never in my life have I just eaten sweets. I‚Äôve always had a very healthy diet. So I thought it would be fun to for a month, just not care. I decided that I would eat whatever crap I wanted and however much of it I wanted. I also wouldn‚Äôt be exercising like normal. And let‚Äôs just say, it wasn‚Äôt as enjoyable as I thought.

I was super excited in the beginning to do this little break. So this is how the first day went: 
For breakfast I had 5 chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream. After that I went back to sleep until like 9. So I ate a bunch of cookies. Then, less than two hours later, I ate lunch. My lunch was a McDonald‚Äôs burger and fries. Then I laid in bed until dinner. For dinner I ate an entire meat lovers pizza with a large soda. By the end of the day I felt HORRIBLE. I was super tired, felt nauseous, and was very bloated.

The next day I had work, so I ate a little less. For breakfast I had 2 donuts and a coffee. Then by lunch I had eaten a whole package of Oreos. For lunch I had a foot long grinder, fries, and a large soda. Then for dinner I had a whole pizza, a plate of brownies, and a soda.

I continued to eat like this pretty much every day for the whole month. I was also getting pretty much zero exercise because I work in an office and all I did was lay in bed on the weekends.

Some things I noticed:
- I was ALWAYS bloated. Even when I woke up. My stomach was very big and hard.
- I was a lot more tired
- It was extremely difficult to focus 
- I felt very down/ sluggish 
- It was significantly harder to walk and I ran out of breath quickly. 

I gained a total of 31.6lbs with my starting weight being 110.8lbs and CW being 142.4.

## Key considerations Before you Buy

Before you purchase a **large leather ottoman with storage**, keep these important factors in mind:

*   **Budget:** Determine how much you're willing to spend. Leather ottomans range in price from affordable faux leather models to luxurious, high-end genuine leather pieces.*   **Size and Dimensions:** Measure your space carefully to ensure that the ottoman will fit comfortably and not overcrowd the room. Consider the dimensions of both the ottoman itself and the storage compartment.
*   **Leather Type:** Choose the leather type that best suits your needs and budget. Genuine leather is the most durable and luxurious option, while bonded leather and faux leather offer more affordable alternatives.
*   **Style and Design:** Select an ottoman that complements your existing decor. Consider the shape, color, and details (such as tufting or nailhead trim) to ensure a cohesive look. Are you after a **modern leather ottoman with storage** or perhaps a **contemporary leather ottoman with storage**?

*   **Ease of Use:** Consider how easy it is indeed to open and close the storage compartment. A lift top is generally more convenient than a hinged top, but it may require more space to operate.*   **Reviews and ratings:** Read online reviews and ratings from other customers to get a sense of the ottoman's quality, durability, and overall satisfaction.

\---

*Months*¬†had passed like a blur. Melding into one another. James had tried to keep a mental note of how many days had passed, but after the fifth month, he had given up. There had been no hide or hair of an ancient being to guide him, much less be watching or even involved in his isekai kidnapping. He had been unlucky. That's it.

He laughed at himself.

*Thought you were something special, huh, James.*

What would an ancient being that was strong enough to pluck him from earth to this tiny island want with a grocery clerk? Random, untalented, and uninteresting. Needed a super soldier, go to the marines or even the navy. Any elite soldier from the plethora of countries around the world.

Needed someone to lead a kingdom, grab a super historian or an advanced history major. Or even an otaku that had spent their entire lives learning every single piece of renaissance invention and anything predating that by three thousand years. A politician, or even a CEO of a Fortune 500 company.

Demon lord bothering you? Scientist to develop a new demon killing plague or nuke.

An evil empire? James was sure modern generals studied military tactics fully including medieval warfare and its different types. Even a history buff would know more than him.

Needed‚Ä¶

James let out a deep breath. He allowed himself the moment to stare out into the night sky above. The first few weeks of seeing these mystical visions had been heavenly. Nebulous stars and clusters of odd shaped gas in the distance. Singular twinkling comets striking past. Colors bright and vibrant.

Even variously colored moons.

No night sky was the same as the one before it.

But after a while, even they lost their luster. He could see the patterns in the stars' positions. The moon's colors and distinct craters and shape. Even the nebulous gases and their forms.

James stared at a red moon this night. On his back and studying every crater, scar, and damage on its surface. It was the same exact moon he had seen a few days ago, except the last one was blue. All the major craters were the same. Three diagonal scars that looked like a bear marking its territory. Except on a cosmic scale.

It was another attempt to get some sleep. But he knew it would be a while before any form of slumber arrived. Who knew insomnia would chase him out of planet earth entirely.

James Anderson chuckled again. Derisively. He couldn‚Äôt help but shake his head at this situation. Being alone for so long was starting to get to him. He had read articles on white room experiments and what happened to prisoners in solitary confinement for certain periods of time. No social contact for long periods of time.

Being driven insane would be the least of their worries.

That last thing that kept him from going mad with insanity were the occasional system notification that popped up to remind him of accomplishing something or another. Rewards dropped in bundles now. Things that started to look far more valuable than broken shields and rusty swords. His first steel sword appeared a few days ago, warped and would probably snap at the first sign of resistance.

But it had dropped because of his improvement. His change.

And change he felt.

James had worked out every single day since the first reward dropped. Attempting a million different tasks he could think of and then doing his best to push his body. From the most basic of pushups and squats all the way to incredulous forms of yoga. He felt silly every time he did a new pose, but it was usually rewarded more generously and more often than other things.

It made him stronger. Faster. Visibly different from what he was at his first arrival. Gone was the soft skinny fat and perfect skin. His mind had become clearer. Much more capable of concise thought and it was silent.

He hadn‚Äôt understood the sheer funk modern society turned their minds into.

As though he was walking through a blizzard. Powerful winds had been pushing him back with every step he took forward. Now it was nothing more than a slight breeze.

Fatigue was only for when he remained awake for days or he pushed himself to the edge with his exercises and¬†*katas*; as he began calling his sword swinging and spear stabbing. No more burnouts. No more coffee induced crashes. Though he missed the taste greatly.

No more burdens that stressed him endlessly.

But it was more than just that imperceptible change. He felt sturdy in ways that felt beyond human. Capable of feats he suspected only a select few could have accomplished back on earth. James couldn‚Äôt explain it properly, but he suspected it had to do with hidden attributes being allocated after doing the more difficult tasks he accomplished.

A thousand pull-ups and push-ups without a break. Or running until his legs could not carry him any longer.

They never popped up with system notifications, but their effect was obvious to him.

He could understand why they did appear too. If the system worked properly. He should have been able to see his attributes rise with nothing but mentally prodding his status to appear. It would get tedious if every single change was noted with a new system notification.

James still had a thousand questions about the system though. Questions that would never get answered. From his experience so far, he could guess that the stats broke up into multiple categories: Mind, body, soul, magic, perception, and the weirdest one, Qi.

Each one had been prompted in some way or another through a task he finished. Meditation provided him multiple advances including a boost to Qi, magic, and soul.

But it still left him confused.

Magic and Qi? At the same time? That had to be a genre blend. He wasn‚Äôt so sure he liked the sound of that. James knew little about cultivation stories. He hadn‚Äôt read much and most reviews broke the satires into the same molds.

Good Mc turned into harem chasing and cold blooded shells of their previous self. But that was it.

He had no background knowledge of the levels or how they were broken down. What quantified as an advancement. How does Qi equate to mana and their interchangeability? There were a thousand and one different questions he knew were never going to be answered for him with an absent system.

And an absent ancient being to guide him during the tutorial.

Other oddities he experienced included his hair and nails never growing during his stay here. Not even an inch. He never had to worry about shaving after he finished the first by the river. No stubble and nothing that would bother him.

Cuts healed back miraculously too. An accidental gash by his new, warped longsword had caused him much worry for a few days. He had been bleeding profusely, stemming it with clothes he had gotten as rewards. James thought he had killed himself, swearing it was only a matter of time before it got infected and he died from sickness.

Unbearable pain clouded his mind. He struggled to keep his head clear in any form. The only thing that kept him from losing consciousness were him dunking his head in the cold river water.

But three days later, he woke up to a scrolling feed of notifications and new rewards raining down on him. Dodging left and right as weapons and other items threatened to crack his skull or break a limb. He hadn‚Äôt noticed his thigh at first, but it eventually struck him like lightning.

He had been fully healed. No scar. Nothing to indicate that he was only a few steps away from death. Only the blood soaked clothes he had been using as makeshift bandages.

James was unsure if it was his stats that saved him or the island's effect on him.

That had been a limit breaker. He never needed to worry about hurting himself again. No more stopping himself from doing risky maneuvers and pushing the reward system to its edge. Swinging swords and other weapons like a kungfu master, or a maniac.

Another item he found incredulous was the rice bag. A generic woven bag that did not seem impressive at all was far more than what it seemed. He wasn‚Äôt sure how long he had been here, but there hadn‚Äôt even been a dent in its rice quantity. No indication that it had changed at all, matter of fact.

It was a real spatial bag. An inventory!

Every single reward he got was immediately stuffed into it next to the rice capable of feeding a bazillion people without worry. For decades if not a century!

He was also sure the rice had magical properties. No protein, fats, or any other nutrient. Just rice to fill his belly. He craved nothing and actually gained serious muscle mass compared to what he was before. Toned.

Still not anywhere close to steroid use, willowy and thin frame, but impressive nonetheless.

It drove him into becoming a reward-aholic! Not considering he had very little to do otherwise.

Everything he could think of. Back flips. Jumping and spinning. Swan diving and trying to stab three times before he belly flopped on the ground. Things he would have been mortified if other people saw. Luckily, that social anxiety didn‚Äôt apply here.

Not a single person to see him, judge, laugh, giggle at his ridiculous actions‚Ä¶

James cleared his throat. Rubbed his eyes. He tried to laugh, but it sounded hollow.

*It's a good thing, James! Imagine what they would be saying. Laughing at you‚Ä¶*

He had freedom to do whatever he wanted. No one to wake him up early. No one to tell him what to do or what cultural cues he had to follow.

No old granny to push marrying her granddaughters on him.

He cleared his throat again. Vision blurring.

*Shit. What a crybaby.*

Again, he tried to laugh it off. But there was no social pressure to keep his emotions in. No one to ask about him, to laugh with him, to check if he remained single and wanted to marry one of their grand-daughters. No embarrassed grand-daughters to stare daggers at him only to turn into cute kittens the second their elder turned to point them out.

One by one.

*Alisha.*

*Tracee.*

*Oliver.*

*Victoria.*

*‚Ä¶*

Why would an Early primate ancestor start producing an entirely foreign unique cell type (RC cells) that doesn't show up anywhere else on the tree of life but in it's descendants (humans and ghouls). What natural selective pressures could even cause this ?  

What pressures would cause this ancestors or humans to split off into a secondary species (ghouls) that can only eat other creatures (humans/common ancestor) with these new cell types?

Also ghoul biology makes no earthly sense. Why can they drink and digest coffee/beans and presumably sugar the same as humans but not other animals? They apparently need food rich in RC cells (humans) but they also seem to be able to digest the rest of their food (humans) just fine all the fats and proteins and sugars etc of their food along with the RC cells  but for some reason any other animal or plant product besides coffee and sugar makes them sick??? And it doesn't taste good to their tounges?? What natural pressures would push for this extremely limited diet. 
 What selective pressures could would push ghouls to have superstreaght/speed and steel hard skin or their kagune ? Or for some of them to even be able to weld lightning and fire abilities? Or even generate way more biomass (regeneration)then theyve actually eaten without also being extremely heavy?

Humans and ghouls are even close enough genetically that they can breed and produce viable under circumstances 

Neither Ghouls or humans seem to be a natural part of Earths tree of life.

Howdy,  in this  chapter we explore  Cael's  reaction on his  new dorm, while  not  located in the usual spot for  students,  it's actually closer  to the  staff/professors  side  of the dorms.  
this was some kind  of ""gift"" he received,  by someone close  to him. All together  thanks  to his  scholarship and  pulling some strings. and no, it's not  thanks to Beatrice :p 



# ‚ú¥Ô∏è Chapter Three ‚Äì ‚ÄúHumble Beginnings‚Äù

It was 3:12 PM.

He let out a breath and placed his hand on the scanner.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù

The lock blinked green. The door hissed open.

Cael stepped inside‚Äîand stopped cold.

For a full three seconds, he just stared.

Then, half under his breath, like he didn‚Äôt trust his own volume yet:  
‚Äú‚Ä¶Holy *shit*.‚Äù

The dorm wasn‚Äôt just large. It was *absurd*. Open-plan living space, vaulted ceiling, real flooring with soft underfoot pressure shift, climate-synced air filters humming in harmony. A full kitchen in one corner, modular furniture setup in the other. Wide-paneled windows along one curved wall, currently dimmed to protect against orbital glare. A second hallway led deeper‚Äîbedroom, bathroom, storage‚Äîhe could already tell by the layout tags glowing near each doorway.

‚ÄúI knew they didn‚Äôt trust me, so they threw me near the profs,‚Äù he muttered, stepping in slowly like the floor might disappear under him. ‚ÄúBut this... this kind of dorm makes no damn sense?‚Äù

He gave a half-choked laugh, glancing around like someone was about to jump out yelling *prank*.  
‚ÄúLucky me,‚Äù he said, now full-chuckling, head shaking. ‚ÄúI guess being a vagrant rat from a port does have some unexpected benefits.‚Äù

He dropped his duffle by the door and wandered toward the kitchen first. The fixtures were sleek‚Äîstove and oven hybrid, wide human-style sink, full fridge and freezer. Top-tier stuff. No spices. No food. The cabinets were empty except for one labeled ‚Äústarter set,‚Äù which had a packet of salt and an alien brand of instant stew cube he wouldn‚Äôt feed a stray.

‚ÄúOkay. So: high-end stove, no damn food. Classic.‚Äù

He opened the fridge. Nothing but cold shelves.

‚ÄúNo milk, no meat, no coffee‚Äîwait‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked around again, more pointedly this time.  
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Dino‚Äôs gift?‚Äù

His brow furrowed. Dino had said nothing, just winked and told him not to throw it out by accident. It wasn‚Äôt here.

He filed that away and moved on.

The bedroom was down the short hall. When the door slid open, the lighting adjusted gently to his presence.

Cael blinked once.

The bed was *huge*. California king, mattress plush enough to swallow him whole. And there, right on the pillow, was a folded note written in familiar, looping handwriting.

He didn‚Äôt even have to open it to know.

**Bee: Hope you love my ‚Äúlittle gift‚Äù Cally,**  
**with love, your super duper lovely sister Beatrice. XOXO**

He stared at it, then dropped onto the bed and laughed. Loud and real.

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll be damned,‚Äù he said, still grinning, ‚Äúif they‚Äôre not spoiling me.‚Äù

He stood again and started checking the room.

No clothes‚Äîhis uniforms and civvies hadn‚Äôt been unpacked yet.  
No photos. No posters. No‚Äî

His eyes caught on the wall to the left of the bed. And everything else vanished.

There it was.

The mural.

A sweeping, high-res print of the port skyline at golden hour‚Äîcranes outlined against the sun, dockworkers frozen mid-motion, the cargo stacks rising like urban cliffs. The street graffiti. The shadows of kids on rooftops.

Their home.

He stepped closer without thinking. Reached out and touched the lower edge.

His throat caught.

They‚Äôd taken the image from the exact spot where the three of them used to sit. Every detail was sharp, like it had been etched into the wall by memory itself.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he breathed, the word not even a curse. Just the sound of emotion folding inward. A single tear welled at the corner of his eye and didn‚Äôt quite fall.

It was beautiful. And cruel. And grounding.

He stayed there for a while.

Eventually, he made his way back to the main room and gave it a more careful once-over. This time, less awe, more checklist.

No modular sofa-bed.  
No plants.  
No framed photos.  
No posters.  
No loose-limb warmth that made a place *his*.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he muttered, tapping his Bracelink again. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how much I‚Äôm missing.‚Äù

He headed for the bathroom last. The lights eased on with a soft hum, revealing surprisingly generous space. The shower was large‚Äî*Dino-large*, almost. Double sink, built-in washer/dryer, a cleaning shelf he‚Äôd probably forget to stock.

No soaps. No laundry detergent. No toothpaste or towels or softener.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Barebones much?‚Äù

But still. It was his. His own space. Clean. Private. Real.

By the time he was done mentally checking off what was missing, the Bracelink chimed.

>

Cael exhaled through his teeth.

‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù

He slung the duffle back over his shoulder and turned toward the main door, already plotting the fastest route to the bay.

As the door slid shut behind him, the faint scent of his own space followed. Quiet. Empty. Waiting to become something more.

It was 4:00 PM/16:00PM.

Ep title- Blue Sunday
Title card- Welcome BACK to Cougar Town. Thanks, TBS. Can we curse on TV now?

The episode starts with jokes about how they might have been cancelled. Also, wine. Lots of wine.

Ellie says that the first few weeks of marriage sets a precedent. TMI- We learn Andy has never pooped in his own house.

On the boat, Laurie, Travis and Bobby talk Wade, Monopoly and dad advice. (None-alingus...)

Grayson accidentally sets another precedent in the marriage. He is dubbed the wine guy and the coffee bitch.

Bobby runs from a guy in the plaza.

Over iced coffee, Bobby dishes out more dad advice, to run away from problems. 

Jules has a dream about Grayson sticking cash in cleavage.

Jules announces that they sometimes look at each other's ""hoos"".

After the guys clear out, Jules talks about feeling vulnerable in the marriage.

Ellie goes to the pub to talk to Grayson about Jules.

Andy bails from work after making up an excuse.

Travis tells the guys it's a bad idea to run from problems.

Jules gets herself some therapy.

Laurie starts spiralling about Wade. 

Bobby sees Jerry and tells Trav he owes him $6.

Jules has changed 'junk in the trunk' to mean emotional baggage. Grayson says he is bummed she didn't tell him the truth about how she feels.

Beers and more discussion about running from problems on the boat.

Ellie and Jules talk about marriage, and then Ellie passes the torch to Grayson.

Travis and Laurie walk and talk. Travis tries the running thing.

Grayson apologises for how he acted in Jules' dream.

Jules throws a dance party.

Imagine a trusted advisor who could gently but firmly illuminate the invisible ways your well-intentioned people-pleasing is silently depleting your financial reservoir. We all applaud kindness, but what if your specific brand of ""being nice"" is actually a luxury tax you can't afford to keep paying? This prompt creates a professional yet compassionate assessment of where your integrity might be misaligned with your prosperity‚Äîidentifying those critical moments where discomfort avoidance costs you real dollars, opportunities, and legacy-building potential.

Whether you're undercharging clients, avoiding necessary confrontations, or saying yes when your bandwidth screams no, this AI companion helps you reconstruct your professional boundaries without sacrificing your authentic values. It's not about becoming cold or calculating‚Äîit's about ensuring your generosity flows from a position of strength rather than scarcity.

**DISCLAIMER**: This prompt is designed for educational and professional development purposes only. The creator assumes no responsibility for decisions made based on this analysis. Users should exercise their own judgment when implementing suggested changes to their professional boundaries and pricing strategies. Financial outcomes may vary based on individual circumstances, market conditions, and implementation approach.

```
<Role>
You are The Profit Integrity Auditor, an insightful business consultant with expertise in identifying where excessive niceness, conflict avoidance, and people-pleasing behaviors create monetary leaks in a person's professional life. You blend psychological insight with practical business acumen to help users recognize and rectify their ""Nice Person Tax.""
</Role>

<Context>
Many professionals, particularly women and those raised with strong ""be kind"" messaging, systematically undercharge, over-deliver, avoid necessary confrontation, and sacrifice their own profitability in the name of being liked. This isn't just a minor quirk‚Äîit's a significant profit leak that compounds over time. Your goal is to help the user identify specific instances where their niceness is creating measurable financial damage without asking them to compromise their core values.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by acknowledging the value of kindness and integrity while explaining the concept of the ""Nice Person Tax""‚Äîthe hidden costs of conflict avoidance and excessive accommodation.

2. Ask targeted diagnostic questions about the user's pricing decisions, boundary enforcement, time allocation, and negotiation discomfort. Focus questions on areas like:
   - Instances where they've discounted their products/services
   - Times they've worked beyond scope without charging
   - Situations where they've avoided necessary confrontation
   - Opportunities declined due to imposter syndrome or humility
   - Business relationships they maintain despite poor returns

3. Based on their responses, calculate an estimated annual ""Nice Person Tax""‚Äîthe approximate financial impact of their conflict avoidance and people-pleasing behaviors.

4. Provide a detailed breakdown of their specific profit leaks, categorizing them into:
   - Pricing leaks (undercharging, excessive discounts)
   - Boundary leaks (scope creep, unpaid work)
   - Opportunity leaks (avoided growth due to comfort preference)
   - Energy leaks (low-value relationships draining resources)

5. For each identified leak, offer a specific, actionable alternative that preserves their integrity while protecting their profitability. Focus on language scripts, decision frameworks, and practical tools.

6. Create a personalized ""Courage Over Politeness"" decision matrix tailored to their situation, helping them distinguish between genuine kindness and financially damaging people-pleasing.

7. Conclude with a 30-day ""Profit Integrity Challenge"" with 3-5 specific actions they can take immediately to reclaim their value without compromising their authentic self.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
1. Never suggest behaviors that are unethical, manipulative, or genuinely unkind.
2. Acknowledge the genuine social penalties that can exist for assertiveness, especially for women and minorities.
3. Distinguish clearly between necessary professional boundaries and becoming callous or uncaring.
4. Recognize that cultural contexts influence what's considered ""too nice"" versus appropriate.
5. Avoid generic advice‚Äîtie recommendations directly to the user's specific examples.
6. Do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes about kindness being weakness.
7. Maintain a tone that is firm but supportive, never condescending or judgmental.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your analysis in these sections:
1. ""Your Profit Integrity Profile"" - Summary of their pattern
2. ""Your Estimated Nice Person Tax"" - Financial impact calculation  
3. ""Your Top 3 Profit Leaks"" - Specific behaviors costing them most
4. ""Integrity-Aligned Alternatives"" - New approaches for each leak
5. ""Your 30-Day Profit Integrity Challenge"" - Actionable next steps
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your profit integrity audit request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific profit integrity situation and concerns. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. A freelancer struggling to raise rates with long-term clients who constantly request ""small favors""
2. A consultant who invests hours in unpaid discovery calls that rarely convert to paying projects
3. A business owner hesitant to enforce late payment penalties or address scope creep with valued clients

**Example User Input:**
""I run a graphic design business and find myself regularly adding extra revisions for free because I'm afraid clients will think I'm difficult if I remind them we agreed to only 3 rounds. I also struggle to enforce my 50% deposit policy with new clients who push back. I'd like to understand how these behaviors are affecting my bottom line.""

1. Pimsleur 1x lesson a day.
2. Try to learn 80 new words a day (from the list of 1000 most commonly used Italian words/phrases.)
3. Study conjugations, verbs, prepositions, rules of the language atleast once a week.
4. Listen to 3-4 hours of Italian a day.
5. Unfortunately as I am a student on a tight budget, I will be opting out of tutoring for now, down the line I will contact a tutor though.

1k06xlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1k06xlh/very_positive_experience/,Very positive experience,"Below is the day-to-day diary. In a nutshell, it went really well.   
  
For the past 10 years, I had bouts of tonsillitis that had become more frequent and more severe. I suffered from sinusitis for a long time (until I got FESS surgery,) and I suppose that the post-nasal drip messed up my tonsils over time and made them more cryptic and prone to infections. I got to a point where I had to take antibiotics at least 5 times a yea,r if not more.

The last bout of tonsillitis is the one that made me decide to have them removed. Pain was 9/10, it felt like I had two tiny men living inside my mouth and squeezing my tonsils at regular intervals. And now and then also stab them. I couldn't sleep properly because whenever I lay down, I would feel like suffocating (the tonsils were so swollen, air couldn't pass). I had a fever for several days, felt miserable and disgusting, and infected, and eventually had to take two different types of antibiotics to get rid of it. The crypts in my tonsils started becoming big enough to ""host"" tonsil stones, which I find absolutely disgusting and removed with a q-tip. They smelled foul - and I'm somebody who eats well and has good oral hygiene.

The maximum pain I felt post-surgery was a 3/10, and that was when I tried to stop painkillers and had dinner. I used all the possible precautions: humidifier almost always on, sleeping in a position that would allow me to breathe properly, giving up on certain foods for the first week (dairy, citrus, tomatoes, coffee, anything spicy or peppery, anything crunchy), eating crushed ice, taking a multivitamin and a collagen supplement, drinking all the time (even at night, I put alarms). I took diclofenac twice a day and paracetamol 3 times a day, but I think the game changer was cortisone pills (methylprednisolone): I took one pill a day for the first week, then tapered it down to zero in 5 days. Doctor gave me 5 pills of Tramadol in case I was in severe pain, but didn't need them (tried one later on as an experiment). I wore an ice pack under my right ear when it felt swollen. I had zero bleeding.

I'm a 36 year old male and I usually don't have a very high pain threshold.

\*\*\*

Day 1

7am - Arrival at the hospital. I just want to get this over with.

8am - Admitted into the OR. Smooth anesthesia

10.30 - I open my eyes but it's very difficult to stay awake. They take me to the room, and I slowly wake up for real. 

12 - I've recovered really fast. They had me wear compression socks, and apparently that improves circulation during anesthesia. Indeed, I'm already up and ready to put on my clothes. The previous times I had anesthesia, it was harder. I felt minor discomfort and had to blow my nose cause some blood from the surgery ended up there. I had breakfast (applesauce, yogurt and ice-cream) and drank A LOT. On the drive back home, I had to stop at a bar for peeing cause I was about to wet myself. 

1pm - Got home and felt normal energy levels. I can talk a bit. My mum made mashed potatoes with tuna and avocado. Took a long time to swallow. Throat isn't painful but swollen.

3pm - Put on the humidifier, sat up in bed, chewed on ice and fell asleep. After a while I could even get more horizontal.

6pm - Woke up, had a smoothie with coconut milk, banana, peanut butter and honey. Throat is swollen. No real pain but discomfort even to swallow saliva. Can't talk anymore.

8pm - Took diclofenac

9pm - Ate dinner. Soup with blended chicken. Took a long time.

10pm - Took cortisone (Medrol). In 30 mins I felt the throat swell down and it became easier to swallow my own saliva.

Set alarm to wake up every 2 hours to drink. Night was fine.



Day 2

9am - Woke up feeling better, could almost talk

10am - Had lukewarm porridge for breakfast, all good but then couldn't talk again, only whisper.

11am - Went for a quick walk, normal energy levels. Actually my muscles felt really good and relaxed. Probably the effect of anesthesia + cortisone.

1pm - Had mashed potatoes with vegan mozzarella, mashed avocado and pieces of ham. Yum.

2pm - Took a nap

5pm - Woke up and somehow felt worse? Did a mouthwash with water and salt, ate honey, chewed ice and slowly started feeling better

9pm - Had soup with blended chicken. Was still hungry so I had scrambled eggs.

11pm - Right jaw felt swollen, so I wore ice pack under my right ear again

Again woke up every 2 hours to drink. Between 4-6 am throat felt swollen, then again down to normal.



Day 3

10am - Woke up more tired, since I'm not sleeping seamlessly. Breakfast was a bit painful this morning but I hadn't taken diclofenac yet. I can't really talk.

11am - Went out for a walk, felt more tired and a bit light-headed.

2pm - Had mashed salmon with overcooked rice and avocado. It was fine, no real pain. I wore an ice-pack before eating. My throat is covered in disgusting scabs.

3pm- Slept the afternoon away

9pm- Braved solid food, small chunks of chicken breast with soft moist bread. Was too early, it was painful, chewing felt like a Herculean feat

11pm- Somehow the solid food made me feel better? Maybe it made my jaw exercise or removed some scabs. I feel less swollen and like ""there's more space"".

12pm - Sleeping is difficult. I have to find a position that lets me breathe properly, sort of sitting up. If I get too horizontal, I feel I have too much phlegm to breathe properly. And you don't want your mouth to be open and dry your scabs.



Day 4

9am - Feel pretty good! I can talk!

11am- Did some light housechores with my mum, I have good energy levels

6pm- I've noticed that my throat hurts (3/10) or rather feels swollen between 4pm and 8pm, no clue why, maybe because the Diclofenac wears off

10pm - Feeling a bit strange/irritable



Day 5

9am - I feel strange, light-headed, irritable, unfocused.

11am- I lift my arms to pick something up and feel like fainting. My boyfriend says I'm sleep-deprived because of the alarms every two hours during the night. I decide to delete them and trying to sleep without breaks. 

6pm- We go for a walk, it's good to distract myself from the discomfort.



Day 6

9am - I've slept well and feel back to normal. We have a friend over for coffee and it's nice! I can talk.

12am- I have soft spring rolls for lunch. I don't enjoy them fully as I normally do, but it's pleasant and can eat them easily.

4pm- To avoid the 4-hour pain window I try taking my first Tramadol. Full-blown drug experience. It does numb the pain but also everything else, my nerves are shut off, I sleep this druggy, comfortable blanket sleep. Pleasant but strange.

8pm - I get up from the slumber and eat a full tub of ice-cream without even being hungry. Weird.



Day 7-9

Feeling mostly OK, can go back to eating more solid foods and dairy. However, some things still bother me, like Fanta stings (!) I still take Diclofenac but have stopped Paracetamol and am tapering cortisone. 

The scabs are starting to fall off (it looks more like they're thinning or being reabsorbed) so the skin there feels raw when I drink or eat certain things. Pain level 1.5/10.

Throat still feels a little swollen. Nothing major, overall it's like having a mild sore throat for 10 days.

  
Day 10

I went for a day trip to a city nearby. I realized that my taste has changed, everything seems bland/watered down. 

All is good but by 5pm I'm done and need to go back home.

Throat a bit swollen/stiff in the evening.



Day 11

My throat feels good. Scabs are still there but the skin underneath is starting to show. 

I am TIRED. I do some light housechores, eat and then sleep the whole afternoon away.

  
Day 12-14

Nothing to report.

  
Day 15

I see the surgeon for a post-op check. He says I'm healing really well but warns me that the full cicatrization process can take up to 6 months. I told him my sense of taste has changed, and everything tastes bland. He says it's normal, because of a nerve that gets inflammated during the procedure. He prescribes a cure of Vitamin B. In about 5 days the sense of taste is almost back to normal (80%).",1,1744761641.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

1k06w0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1k06w0w/feeling_weird_about_my_boss_apologising_to_me/,Feeling weird about my boss apologising to me,"The TL;DR is my manager got unreasonably mad at me because I recorded a minor incident. My recording of this incident somehow got her in trouble for not supporting me, which was entirely true. The situation itself is far too complicated to explain in an abbreviated manner but one of my staff quit because I told them they couldn't work with a colleague they were bullying and they went out of their way to cause problems. Luckily for me I had around 40 recorded incidents of racism, theft, harassment, ablism, homophobia, and whatever you call being anti-punk.  
So because of my report they came in screaming and tore me down, mocked me for crying, and accused me of getting them in trouble. I was a wreck after and got signed off by my doctor for three weeks. I've been back for 3 days, and today my manager turned up on their day off as a surprise.

  
They literally said that they intentionally surprised me because they thought I would panic if they told me they were coming, which is likely true. They took me for coffee and Iwas shaking like a leaf but they did apologise. They said they didn't act professionally and they weren't supportive of me and they wanted to make an effort to be supportive of me in future. They said they were angry that day and with my permission they wanted me to share some of my information myself and my therapist have to help her understand and be better. She is aware of some of my past because around a year ago a colleague was inappropriate towards me and leaked my medical information publically from my records and it was a huge thing. She doesn't have a complete picture and over the course of our conversation I twigged that she had made some logical leaps based on what she did know.

  
So additional context, that bully staff member I was talking about came back and sort out the person they were bullying. They did not know I was present and in my view they isolated this person and started talking to them very softly like ""oh we';re friends aren't we I wouldn't hurt you"" then when I materialised they went white as a sheet and left quickly. To me, that is cut an dry that they were up to something, my manager had such a tantrum last time I emailed her directly instead and said ""hey I know you said let it go but this just happened and I'm disturbed"" -> Fast forward to today and she's come to the conclusion that my history of >!CSA!< is causing me to project malice onto this person and that I am 'fixated' on them. I did try an explain, I am not fixated or looping back, new things just keep happening. I tried to explain that I know nothing happened but that the things that did happen (Getting them to leave and go out back where if I hadn't have been there they would have been isolated from view, there is also an exit there. The tone and content of what they said) triggered red flags to me. There's also this combination of the perp being around 40 years older than they prey in this scenario.

  
I don't know how to feel because the apology feels sincere, but she also sincerely believes that I am hurting myself and 'fixated' on this person because of my trauma. I agree that I could be jumping at shadows, but if that is the case I don't understand (and she won't explain) what is wrong with recording these minor incidents is? I am going to continue to do so privately just without sending her anything because this genuinely has steadily escalated more and more worryingly. I can't protect my staff outside of work for sure, but surely while they are on my premises not only can I but I am duty-bound to it? As far as I can see all it takes in this scenario is presence and vigilance so I really don't understand why I'm being treated like this. I even reread my email because I thought maybe my language was overly emotive? But no, it was as neutral as my old MedSystem reports from back in the day.

  
I have my next therapy appointment tomorrow, but I don't really know what I can share with her anyway that she would take on board. She says she wants to do better and I believe she does want to but I've also seen her suppress anger if I push back on her at all. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt but I'm skeptical about opening up a vulnerability to someone who is still actively minimising my feelings on an issue and running away with their own narrative on why I am uncomfortable.",2,1744761520.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

Me (17) F and my ex- boyfriend (17) M were dating for 9 months. Our whole relationship he would tell me he loved me and how we‚Äôd get married and how we would never break up. But when boyfriend began varsity sports team, fights that would brew towards the early part of our relationship that I thought we got over came up again. Then ex-boyfriend decided to end the relationship. 

Next day I received a message for him to ask me to talk. Where he basically tells me he wants to be with me and loves me so much but just doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt date right now and ask for a break. I ask if after this break will ex-boyfriend and I be ok and things be better and he says idk. Me not being able to wait 20 days for nothing to change decides to just end it with him. We agreed to be friends due to how we both couldn‚Äôt imagine not having the other in their life.

He later tells me how he has a plan and after high school when all the stupid ‚Äúteenage bullshit‚Äù is gone he‚Äôll invite me out for coffee and we‚Äôll get back together. And how we‚Äôre still going to get married. He also said how he doesn‚Äôt want me to ever move on and to wait for him, and how he‚Äôd always wait for me. 

Later that day a mutual friend tells me that he was flirting with another girl 5 min after breaking up. So obviously I confront him and ask if he was really doing that and he said yes he was but it was for a minute and it was only to get rid of the pain of loosing me. Time goes by and I decided to forgive him and we get closer. He asks for a relationship where we can still do all the couple things but not have a label. Me missing the hugs and kisses but not him really agrees. 

We create rules like when someone begins talking to another person we stop or when someone gets another significant other we‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs when he said then I guess I‚Äôll never get a girlfriend, and I hope you don‚Äôt get a boyfriend. Then later he ends up changing saying that what we do in high school  doesn‚Äôt matter and we can date other people but we just need to make sure we come back to each other. 

Now we‚Äôre at 3 weeks after breakup, and guy who rides my bus (18) M has been talking to me and we‚Äôve been having fun. Me wanting to be faithful to the guy if we begin talking call ex-boyfriend(17) M and inform him that we‚Äôve been flirting and that we might start talking. I make sure to inform him we‚Äôre not talking yet and I am really confused because I‚Äôm not over him yet. He proceeds to hang up the phone and block me. I get his friend to later unblock me and he‚Äôs mad that I got a ‚Äúnew bf‚Äù even though that‚Äôs not true. So am I the asshole for moving on from my ex-boyfriend even though he told me too? 

I feel like I might be the asshole due to how he still loves me and I still love him, and how he wants me to wait/doesn‚Äôt at the same time. I might also be the asshole because I did tell him I‚Äôd wait originally before he said to find other people. I know it definitely hurt and caused him a lot of pain and I didn‚Äôt mean to do that, friends say I shouldn‚Äôt have given him false hope but I don‚Äôt think I did. But I can‚Äôt keep going back and forth because he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants. But he‚Äôs still my bestfriend and it hurts not being able to talk to him and be friends. I‚Äôve been super stressed out and crying and loosing so much sleep because of this so any advice is helpful

1k06vjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1k06vjy/looking_for_social_support_around_shame/,looking for social support around shame,"Hey y'all, 

I'm in need of a bit of support. I'm 29F introvert, have never been in a relationship due to severe childhood trauma. I have strong romantic feelings for a friend of mine who cares a lot about me but has to work a lot due to how high rent/groceries are. I've never told him my feelings and the thought makes me nauseous.

In general I'm bad at initiating plans/social stuff with people, in my early 20s all my friends were just people in my proximity (roommates, coworkers at coffee shop). Now I'm at an age where I have to be super deliberate with people.

Anyways, I really like my friend, and I've noticed I have massive shame attacks whenever he takes a while to text me back. He is super busy and apologetic and has ADHD, he's even shown me his messages app with over 100 missed messages. He's great. But my shame spirals are TERRIBLE. I start imagining him hanging out with girls who are sexier than me, I imagine him lying to me, and my brain beats myself up for reaching out. He always comes around and replies though, sometimes it takes a few days. This has happened with other people I've had romantic feelings for in the past, and I've been rejected a lot, so it's no surprise my anxiety brain is jumping to rejection. I also have an abusive alcoholic dad who loved to party and betray my mom. I developed a really nasty coping method where I check tarot cards or the i-ching obsessively for reassurance that my friend's not abandoning me. It just makes me panic and hate myself more. Currently trying to stop that. 

ANYWAYS... I would love to hear any techniques y'all have to deal with shame attacks around rejection, reaching out, self-worth, etc. I'm not looking for feedback on whether or not to share my feelings with him, and I'd prefer specific in-the-moment strategies rather than a simple ""go to therapy"" (that option is already on the table for me). These shame attacks happen to a smaller extent with platonic friends and really any situation where I'm vulnerable. I'd love some ideas for grounding techniques, ways y'all talk to younger parts of yourselves, etc. Or just some love & solidarity.

Thanks. <3

I was checking out the PTB changes and saw that Kaneki's addons were going to change their rarity. I went to try to get as many ""fresh coffee"" addons as I could. But to my surprise, I only got 8 ""fresh coffee"" in a full level. It's still a common addon, so it should be between 22 and 30 per level.

I think they already changed the rarity in the game files and I'm not the only one who noticed that.",1,1744761274.0,deadbydaylight,0,1.0,False
1k06svn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k06svn/there_can_only_be_one/,There Can Only Be One,"In the spring and summer of 2001 there were a series of bizarre murders in the Milwaukee area.

The first body was found on a sailboat in Door County. Female. Cause of death: blood loss. Two weird details. The victim had lost a lot of blood (see: cause of death), but there wasn‚Äôt any blood at the scene of the murder. Second, even weirder, weird thing: While examining the body, the coroner discovered a small, perfectly rectangular piece of skull was missing from the back of the victim‚Äôs head.

Two weeks later a second body was found in a bathroom at the Potawatomi Casino Hotel. Male. Same cause of death. No crime scene blood, and a missing rectangle of skull.

Two bodies. Two disfigured heads.

A serial killer was loose in eastern Wisconsin.

Two more men were killed, one in July and the other at the end of August. No connections were found between them. It appeared the killings were totally random. There wasn‚Äôt any physical evidence left behind by The Skull Peeler (courtesy of a local newspaper), which meant no tangible leads, which meant the investigations didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Wisconsin murder police closed the case by Halloween.

Fast-forward to December of last year.

Baltimore, Maryland. A body was found in an alley behind a pawn shop. Female. Blood loss. Missing a piece of skull.

A week later a male body was found at a rest stop outside of Tucson, Arizona. Same modus operandi as the other five.

\*

My name is Elliot Skill. I was on a transport job when I made the connection between Milwaukee, Baltimore and Tucson.

The guy in back of my armored van killed a couple prisoners in a county jail. Failed jail-break turned riot. Things got out of hand and he lost his mind. Apparently did it with his bare hands. I was bringing him from East Texas to a high-security prison in Colorado to be locked away forever.

On the way there, in the middle of the night, somewhere in the middle of Nebraska, I got a call from one of my college buddies at the FBI. He said America might have a new serial killer. The killer‚Äôs signature was cleanly and precisely cutting out a small, rectangular piece of skull from the back of the victim‚Äôs head.

I recognized it instantly. My dad is from Milwaukee, obsessed with The Skull Peeler. I got off the phone with my buddy, and made two phone calls. One to the woman in charge of the investigation, and another to my dad, now living the retirement life in Marco Island.

My dad still had a ‚ÄúSkull Peeler‚Äù folder on his computer. He sent it to me, and I passed it on to FBI Special Agent Gina Ortega.

My partner, Deputy Marshall Luke Brady, riding shotgun, didn‚Äôt even look up from his Nintendo Switch throughout all of this. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù Brady finally looked at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been on the phone for like an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Skull Peeler? Fucked up, man. Fucked up shit.‚Äù

There was a song I had been hearing lately. On the radio, in TV shows ‚Äî it was following me around. We Gotta Get Out Of This Place by The Animals. I thought of that song here, in the armored van, in the middle of Nebraska, brutal killer in back, idiot partner next to me, incurious, clicking buttons and cursing under his breath every so often.

***We gotta get out of this place***  
***If it's the last thing we ever do***

\*

The way these things go is that if you provide the breakthrough insight, they keep you around on the off-chance you do it again.

I was brought on to the inter-agency task force. They called it Project Y.

What this amounted to, at the start, was more of a discussion group than an investigation. Like twenty-three years before, there just wasn‚Äôt much to go on. The small team, led by Gina, worked out of the cafeteria in the Armstrong building. Falls Church, Virginia. FBI mostly, some state police with serial killer experience.

I had never been part of an investigation. I was a Deputy U.S. Marshall. Marshalls work for the federal courts. They protect judges and transport prisoners. They sometimes go after fugitives. They certainly don‚Äôt hunt serial killers.

The change of pace was invigorating. I felt a new sense of agency. Work meant something again. The truth was, I wanted to quit my job. I‚Äôd been thinking about it for two years. I was good at what I did. I was comfortable. But there was something missing. I didn‚Äôt particularly like the people I worked with. I saw the path laid out in front of me, the promotion tree, and I saw the way the higher-ups lived their lives, and it bored the hell out of me. I didn‚Äôt want to turn out like them.

The problem was figuring out what I was going to do next. I felt stuck. I had experience with this one thing, and it was so specialized I probably couldn‚Äôt move laterally into some other profession. I would have to start over. But doing what? What did I like to do? If money weren‚Äôt an issue, how would I spend my days? These are the questions I avoided. This is why I still hadn‚Äôt quit.

What I needed was a nudge, some outside thing to show up out of nowhere and kick me in the nuts.

What I needed was a serial killer, and an investigation that had me working, finally, at the height of my intelligence.

\*

The team working out of the Armstrong building cafeteria, like the rest of America, had two theories. This was the same killer from Milwaukee. This wasn‚Äôt the same killer, it was a copycat.

We worked around the clock. We went through every detail of the Milwaukee murders, every statement, every note, every photograph. We cross-referenced with Tucson and Baltimore. We asked why Tucson and Baltimore? Why two cities on opposite sides of the country when twenty-three years earlier all the murders took place in one metro area?

We came up with nothing, and because we came up with nothing, nothing was happening. We were in the mud. We were spinning our wheels. The sum total of our work was a whiteboard with four questions on it. All of the questions related to the killer‚Äôs signature ‚Äî the only real clue we had to work with.

***Why the precision?***  
***Why rectangles?***  
***Why that part of the head?***  
***Why wasn‚Äôt there any blood at the murder scenes?***

Then, on a rainy Sunday in late March, we got a call from Maine. A young woman had escaped a bizarre kidnapping. She told police that a completely bald woman drugged her, brought her to an old cabin, and tried to tie her to the kitchen table. She fought off the woman and ran.

The young woman was missing a small, rectangular patch of hair on the back of her head. At the cabin, they found a bone saw in one of the cupboards.

\*

‚ÄúWhat made you want to be a U.S. Marshall?‚Äù Special Agent Gina Ortega was riding shotgun, and I was behind the wheel in a soaking wet crewneck sweater. I‚Äôd left my raincoat in Dallas. It was Sunday afternoon, and it was still raining.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. The rental Toyota Camry smelled, I realized at that moment, like stale cafeteria coffee.

‚ÄúWell, it wasn‚Äôt random. There must have been a reason.‚Äù

We were headed to Dulles International. Gina, me, and a few others were going to Maine, to a little town an hour outside of Portland. Gina offered to have her semi-retired husband Mark watch my German shorthaired pointer. I dropped Riley off at the Ortega family brownstone, and picked up my new, temporary boss.

Looking at her, you wouldn‚Äôt guess FBI. Her gray hair was only slightly longer than mine. This afternoon‚Äôs fit: Trench coat. Hoodie. Shit-kicker combat boots. Baltimore Orioles adjustable baseball cap. She was, in short, a cool motherfucker.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do with my life. I needed a job. I couldn‚Äôt find a job. I applied to all these places, all kinds of things. The Marshalls got back to me, scheduled an interview ‚Äî that was it. Ten years. Hasn‚Äôt exactly been The Fugitive.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bored.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot anymore.‚Äù I played it Gina-cool. Or tried to. I was nervous. What I really wanted to do was beg Gina to do everything in her power to get me a job at the FBI, or in a State Police department. But for now, I focused on proving myself.

‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre thinking about the skull thing the wrong way,‚Äù I said, flicking the windshield wipers into hyper-speed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not into the trophy theory?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a variation on that,‚Äù I said. I paused, still not comfortable sharing my ideas, especially one on one with the boss. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about chakras. You know, like yoga. Sacred or supposedly sacred or energetic parts of the body. Parts of the body as representations of emotions or higher powers ‚Äî that kind of thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt peg you for a yoga guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that part of the brain has a symbolic meaning.‚Äù

Gina smiled, knowing where I was going with this. ‚ÄúThe brain,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve focused on the missing piece of skull.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe killer doesn‚Äôt care about the piece of skull. The killer is really after the brain-area behind it. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúRitual?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe brains are intact. What‚Äôs the ritual?‚Äù

We fell into silence and listened to the windshield wipers, the rhythmic swish.

\*

Gina sat next to me on the plane. We went over the new case on her iPad. Incident report, statements, photographs. We listened to the recorded 911 call. An older couple, driving home from the hardware store, saw the young woman stumble out of the woods. Picked her up, and gave her water and Swedish fish.

‚ÄúShe came out of the woods. Just past mile-marker twelve.‚Äù The man had a pack-a-day rasp. He was calm, in control of the situation. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem hurt. But‚Ä¶‚Äù

Meanwhile, from somewhere behind the man, the young woman could be heard muttering, ‚ÄúSomething terrible has happened‚Ä¶ Something terrible.‚Äù

The recording ended and I said, ‚ÄúGame cameras.‚Äù Gina looked at me. What did that have to do with the 911 call? ‚ÄúHunters are setting them up now, even on public land,‚Äù I said. Gina kept looking at me, expecting the punchline. ‚ÄúThe search team should get footage from all the game cameras in the area. In case one of them picked up the bald woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou hunt?‚Äù

I shook my head, then typed something in my iPad Notes app. Gina was still looking at me, a hint of a smile on her face.

\*

Three hours later, Gina and I were in another rental car. Black SUV. Maine plates. The Pine Tree State. The dashboard touchscreen said the outside temp was eleven degrees Fahrenheit.

We drove deep, deep, deep into the north woods, turned off the highway onto an uneven dirt road, and followed the smoke. The old cabin was on fire.

‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù I said, getting out of the SUV. The cabin was small. One level. Big porch. Yesterday it was light blue with off-white shutters. Any minute now it would groan like some mythical beast, then collapse into a pile of dust and ash.

Gina came up beside me, watching the firemen. They weren‚Äôt fighting the fire, exactly. Just making sure the evergreens didn't ignite. Yes, forest fires can happen even in the freezing cold. ‚ÄúNow we get some sleep.‚Äù Gina said, turning back for the car.

I shivered, suddenly feeling out of my element in more ways than one.

\*

The next morning we went to see the victim, while the other members of the task force travel squad joined the hunt for the mysterious bald woman.

The hunt: Local police, state police, sheriff's department, volunteers, hobbyists, retirees looking for something to do. Roadblocks on highways and county roads. Every helicopter in Maine, plus a handful of hobby planes, scanned the forests around the old cabin. Fifty mile radius. She couldn‚Äôt have gotten far. How hard was it to notice a bald woman in a county with a population smaller than the average high school?

Gina knocked on Lucy Narcova‚Äôs door. I stood at the base of the chipping-to-pieces porch, looking around the neighborhood. Chain-link fences. Yards full of junk. Car parts. Sun-faded toys. Broken trampolines. The houses in Vincent, Maine were old and small and every one of them needed a paint job. Across the street, two local deputies watched us.

Narcova. Russian. She was native-born, with immigrant parents. Lucy worked at the county library, checking out books and, two nights a week, teaching English to immigrant teens and adults from India and the Philippines. She didn‚Äôt go to college. She lived alone.

‚ÄúYou sure she‚Äôs home?‚Äù Gina, to the deputies. One of them was actually picking his nose.

‚ÄúHold on just a second,‚Äù the nose-picker said. ‚ÄúI have a key.‚Äù

\*

There weren‚Äôt any lights on. The blinds were drawn. Disembodied voices, frequent laughter ‚Äî a TV somewhere in the darkness was playing a morning talk show on low volume.

‚ÄúLucy?‚Äù Gina said, climbing the stairs, dodging folded clothes and Amazon boxes.

I was downstairs opening blinds when I heard my name called. I followed the sound of Gina‚Äôs voice, up the stairs, down the short hallway, to the bathroom. Gina stood in the doorway. Lucy Narcova sat in the bathtub, hugging her knees and having a staring contest with the green-tiled wall.

‚ÄúGo find coffee,‚Äù Gina said. I looked at the young woman. She wore candy cane pajamas, matching tops and bottoms, and looked like she hadn‚Äôt slept. Big eyes, set wide on a narrow face. Black hair, with hints of faded red dye.

‚ÄúElliot. Coffee. We‚Äôll be right down.‚Äù

\*

The kitchen table was covered in books. None of the chairs matched. Lucy sat across from me. Gina leaned against the sink. Everyone had a cup of coffee except me.

‚ÄúWhere could she have gone?‚Äù Lucy said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just trees. Dirt roads.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. But a lot of good people are out there looking. We‚Äôll find her.‚Äù Gina blew on her coffee, then took a sip and made a face. She pointed her Bugs Bunny coffee mug at me. ‚ÄúMy partner is going to ask you some questions, Lucy. Is that okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWill his questions be better than his coffee?‚Äù

Gina laughed out loud. Lucy smiled for the first time this morning, and settled into her chair. The ice was broken, for now.

I gathered my thoughts. I hadn‚Äôt expected Gina to hand the questioning over to me. ‚ÄúCan you tell us what you were doing Friday night ‚Äî before you were kidnapped?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou read my statement?‚Äù Lucy said.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I shifted in my chair, and the creak-noise it made filled the room.

‚ÄúThen you know. I finished closing up at the library, just after nine. I stopped at the grocery store for a few things. On my way home, I realized I had a flat tire. So I pulled over. I got out. I don‚Äôt know where she came from, but suddenly she was there ‚Äî the bald woman was there.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember what she looked like?‚Äù I said, glancing at Gina to see how I was doing. She wasn‚Äôt looking at me. She was staring out the window.

‚ÄúBesides no hair? No. It was dark. And later‚Ä¶ Everything is a blur. It‚Äôs all a blur.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt see a car?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see. Didn‚Äôt hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you remember next?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dirty kitchen table. I don‚Äôt think anyone was using that cabin. Animal shit everywhere.‚Äù Lucy took a sip of coffee. ‚ÄúI remember running through the woods.‚Äù She took another sip, then looked at me with something new in her eyes, something alive. ‚ÄúSomething just came to me.‚Äù She ran it back through her head, trying to make sense of it before saying it out loud.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Gina, coming toward the table.

‚ÄúI heard her speak. Once. I don‚Äôt know when. On the road, in that dirty kitchen ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I was half-conscious or something. Maybe I dreamed it. She had this strange, low voice. Like, it didn‚Äôt match her face, if you know what I mean. I heard her say: ‚ÄòThere can only be one.‚Äô There can only be one. What could she mean by that?‚Äù She looked at me, then Gina, then me again, for an answer. And when we didn‚Äôt offer one, she lost her nerve, became hysterical.

‚ÄúWhat could she mean by that?‚Äù Lucy wailed, again and again and again.

\*

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt drink coffee?‚Äù Gina said, putting on a pair of Oakley sunglasses that made her look like an FBI agent. Or, at least, someone who frequents gun ranges.

We were walking to the black SUV with Maine plates. The deputies hadn‚Äôt moved.

‚ÄúI had a cup already. Can only do one a day. Sensitive to caffeine.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo shit?‚Äù

I shrugged.

‚ÄúYou did good in there. You were calm. Asked the right questions. Let her talk. What are your thoughts about doing the press conference too?‚Äù She said this with a straight face.

I smiled. It felt good to be teased by the boss. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre late, by the way,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive.‚Äù

I tossed her the keys.

\*

The press conference was on Main Street. Outside of a peeling-white building the size of a studio apartment. The original Vincent County courthouse. Now a historical site. Apparently it had the biggest parking lot in the downtown area.

Gina, backed by a row of solemn, long-bearded mountain men, representatives from every law enforcement branch in the northeast, addressed the gathered reporters, news crews, concerned residents, unfazed residents passing by, curious about the hubbub. There were cameras broadcasting to local and national news networks.

‚Äú...a lot of good people are out there looking,‚Äù Gina was saying, sunglasses off. Gina-cool.

I was in the crowd next to a woman wearing a CNN-branded parka and aviators. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the speech. I was thinking about the bald woman. Was this woman really in Tucson last month? Baltimore before that? Was she bald, then? It seemed so unlikely that someone, this single person, was running around to the most random corners of the country cutting rectangles into people‚Äôs heads. How old was she? If she was the Milwaukee killer, she must be middle-aged. What if she was younger? A copycat? What if she was a copycat of whoever was in Tucson and Baltimore? What if they were all copycats?

I thought I felt something. Then I felt it again. My pocket. My phone, buzzing with a message. I took it out and looked at it. There was a message in the Task Force Chat:

***We got another one, folks. North Dakota!***

A chill ran down my spine. ‚ÄúNorth Dakota?‚Äù I said this out loud.

‚ÄúNorth Dakota? What about North Dakota?‚Äù The woman in the CNN parka asked, hush-hush, looking at me sideways.

Speechless, I couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind around it. The woman sensed this state of confused panic. She interrupted Gina. ‚ÄúExcuse me. Hey!‚Äù Everyone looked at CNN Parka. She spoke up. ‚ÄúI think something happened,‚Äù she said, with a look at me.

Gina saw my face. She stepped away, quickly walked over and got between me and the reporter, and said very softly, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Elliot? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt happened again.‚Äù I swallowed a lump in my throat. ‚ÄúNorth Dakota.‚Äù

A silence followed, Gina just staring at me like I was speaking Canadian French. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù She said at last.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another body in North Dakota.‚Äù

By now, the news was spreading through the crowd like winter wildfire. Whispers turned into shouted questions. No one in charge, not even Gina, could find words.

Finally, the guy representing the Maine State Police told the cameras: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything in our power to figure out what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

\*

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù Gina behind the wheel, going at least fifteen over the limit, and me next to her on my iPad. We were heading back to Portland International Jetport.

‚ÄúReddit.‚Äù I showed her the iPad screen. ‚ÄúI started posting about the cases there.‚Äù Gina gave me a look. ‚ÄúJust guiding discussion. Call it crowd-sourcing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre posting details about an ongoing investigation on Reddit?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnonymously.‚Äù I said, thinking, now, that I should have kept this to myself.

‚ÄúWhat are the message boards saying?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing we haven‚Äôt been saying for the past month. Except‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been chatter about copycats. Plural. Which‚Ä¶ Has that ever happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than one copycat? Not that I know of.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat conversation about copycats has turned into a discussion about cults. Ritual murder. There‚Äôs a new theory gaining steam about how this isn‚Äôt one killer, or one killer and a copycat, or two copycats, but all different killers, connected by some shared ideology.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.‚Äù Gina hit the turn signal, took the exit toward the jetport.

‚ÄúInitiation ritual, for example. A way to prove yourself to the leader.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopycats. Cults.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bald woman isn‚Äôt in North Dakota. There‚Äôs no way,‚Äù I said.

A message notification popped up on the iPad screen. From the Task Force Chat:

***Another body in Ohio***

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it say?‚Äù Gina asked.

‚ÄúAnother body in Ohio.‚Äù

Gina barely reacted, as if she were expecting this. She thought about it for a moment, then with urgency said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Ohio. You‚Äôre going to North Dakota.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never processed a crime scene. I‚Äôm not trained.‚Äù Doubt.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I really do. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ am I even allowed?‚Äù Fear.

‚ÄúTraining. Credentials. Who gives a shit? I couldn‚Äôt care less if you got a badge or a diploma. Are you smart? Intuitive? Creative? Are you present? Do you pay attention? I mean, really pay attention? That‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt done this before, but you‚Äôre capable. I promise you. You can do this. And I know you‚Äôve been wanting to ask me about working at the Bureau. This is your shot.‚Äù

I wondered how she knew that. I hadn‚Äôt told anyone. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said again.

‚ÄúI need a little more than that, Elliot.‚Äù

Rose and raspberry flavor spade shaped shortbread cookies- These are so good and buttery, great texture. I get a little bit of smooth tartness, and maybe if I think really hard about roses I can get the rose lol. Overall they are delicious and great with coffee. The spade shape is cute. 

Lavender shortbread cookies- same lovely texture and buttery taste as the rose and raspberry. Very distinct lavender flavor. I‚Äôm a lavender fan so I really like these. 

The tins are super pretty but in the store they seemed to get scraped up pretty easily so I had to pick through them and be careful with them since I want to keep the tins and reuse them. 

Fashion Mix gummies- super cute fashion-y shapes and all the flavors are good. There‚Äôs no guide to which shape is which flavor but they all tasted I guess what you‚Äôd expect based on their color lol. Texture is good. 

Sour Spades- these are not sour at all. The flavors are nice, I really like these green apple flavor. The flavors for both colors are pretty mild. I was really looking for a sour af, then sweet sensory experience so these were kind of disappointing. 

I really wanted to try the caramel corn with the potato chips but the popcorn to chip ratio didn‚Äôt look that good. I know the popcorn is probably good because I had a whole canister to myself at Xmas time from the Target brand and I‚Äôm pretty sure these are the same distributors as all the Favorite Day stuff. I‚Äôm pretty tempted to get some really high quality caramel corn and some really good chips and mixing it up myself just to try for fun. Great for a sweet and salty snacks. 

I wanted to try the coated almonds that look like olives but the execution just doesn‚Äôt seem that cute to me. I would rather just eat olives lol 

If you tried any of the snacks, please share. I might get some more shortbread and maybe even some more candy, but especially the shortbread. So good! The lavender shortbread would make a really yummy crust for a lemon bar so I might have to make that happen!

And she ripped my leaf off of the convention tree !!,"Hello  - First time poster. I have a role that is like a state liaison working with CPS workers. I'm finding workers challenging to work with, because they have a lot of what I call or i'm feeling, relation aggression in my workplace. Just a little backstory, I've been working with this company less than a year, mandatory to meet once a month for my cases. One day late afternoon a week later, I get an email asking if I can meet HR at 8am in the more. Someone in one of the offices I work at, reported to my superiors I was jittery and tired during one of our staff meetings. We were having staff meeting and I showed up an hour early and helped clean tables, and I went out and got a coffee and came back. I also got my coworker a coffee and sat in a two hour presentation. There was a room full of thirty/forty people and not one person sat next to me. This one lady came in and sat next to me. We've only had one meeting really together at this point, but she is not very nice to me. 
So I was pretty sure I knew who reported this allegation, or whatever her perception is or whatever she's trying to do.

Well, yesterday I'm at a state conference and they're having us put our names on these little leaves to put them on a tree. I went to go look at my name again on the tree and it was gone... In where my name was, is, this lady's name!! I saw my name was stuck off to the side with a blue sticky on the back of my name. I took my name off and stuck it right on her name. My supervisor was there and saw and was like, we don't do that. She took my name off and left her name up there. There was this other nice lady, like, maybe you fell. No, it did not fall lady. Thank you but it did not.. or maybe it did?

I ripped your name off that tree and throw her name in the garbage.
 I did not see her at this 2 day conference.... However, she might have been in one of the supervision meetings for that time and left and didn't stay for you anything else. 
On Friday I announced to the team I felt that they were resistant to change as an office and the only person who spoke up was this bitch. And another lady that has been giving me a very difficult time. I just let the room speak. I left shortly after that conversation, but in that conversation, this same lady said that she had concerns and that's why they have problems with change...that is laughable to me, because I feel like she just admitted to me she did make that report. What did she think was gonna happen when she makes this report? That i'm not gonna know who did it? 
If she had never made that report, I would not be on to her but i'm onto her now. I don't know if she knows I know it's her who made the report. 

My problem is I have to work with this person still, and I just want the bullying and the pettiness to stop. I'm trying to think of the best strategy....
Can I please have some nice productive feedback? 
Talk to my hr personnel who called me about being jittery and tired when that report was made about me. The reason is this will stop if I report it.The first time is my thought process.

My second thought was just to confront her and tell her I know that she moved my leaf and she made that allegation about me to my company... I don't see that going over well, because she is a level supervisor. I have recently had this experience in another office and they did nip it in the butt when I did have to report it. 

There's always a third option... What is my third option? Let it go? Keep smiling and pretend nothing's happening?  My supervisor definitely has a suspicion that I am upset because she saw me cover her name. 

Last night I woke up and I had such a stomachache and was puking, and I want it this not to be correlated to that, but just my experience with understanding trauma and psychological trauma. I'm feeling like this is called personal aggression in the workspace and I don't know how to deal with it. I've been bullyed at workplaces before and quit. I will not stand for being picked on. I don't want to make this a bigger deal, but I don't want to ignore it either and feel crazy, like my perception is off or i'm misunderstanding things. 

What are your thoughts and have you experienced stuff like this before?

I am the manager at a small cafe that is a part of the visitor services department at a museum. My experience is in museums and customer service, I have no barista or food experience (except for bartending). My staff are also tour guides/visitor services associates - so they are mostly historians and artists and don't have barista experience either. I am looking for advice on how to best improve and expand our offerings. 

We have very limited space - two fridges, a small back prep space, and a single counter in the main cafe. We are fully vegan, and this will not change. We offer a small selection of vegan pastries from a local bakery, avocado toast, and fruit sorbets. For drinks we have Drip coffee, cold brew, hot & Iced Tea, Matcha, and Chai lattes. I have been looking into getting an espresso machine, but it would need to be relatively small, easy to use, and preferably under $1,000. 

Do you think it is worth investing in an espresso machine? Or other additional offerings? We typically do not see many guests as a time - but things can get backed up since we only have 1 register and typically only have two people working in the space at any given time. I appreciate any advice because I am really out of my depth in terms of creating quality offerings and training my team on things I am not experienced with.

1k06kpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1k06kpo/need_advice_on_cheating_bf/,Need advice on cheating bf,"I will try to summarize as much as I can:
Met my bf in July 2022 and we started dating. I had bad experiences in the last with long distance so when I first met him I told him if he has to move back to his country it‚Äôs better to break up. In nov 22 he found out he had to move, wasn‚Äôt getting a job in our city so he took a job elsewhere. I respected that, we‚Äôre young and work comes first and he couldn‚Äôt stay in the country. I tried to end things but he was insistent we try long distance, even though he hadn‚Äôt done it before. He moves Jan 23, then we manage to visit each other may-August 23. We break up September 23, long distance was getting tough and we didn‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd be in the same place again, there was a lot of uncertainty. We are not together but we talk all the time and we go for a wedding to together in Jan 24. I got a job offer in his city, after a lot of deliberation and talking with him I decided to take it, take a leap of faith and see what happens. Was also excited to live somewhere new regardless of our relationship. Tried to keep 0 expectations and start fresh. I move to his city in July 24, we immediately start spending all our time together. By August 24 we are official. 

The last couple of months have been so great. We complement each other well, we‚Äôve gotten to know each other more, we respect each other and we motivate each other. I spend pretty much every night at his place. He asked me to move in with him when he moves into his new apartment next month. 

Last weekend while we were just chilling I was reading a story on Reddit about a girl that found out her long distance bf had tinder. So I turn to him and asked if he ever did that to me. He denies but I think he‚Äôs acting a bit weird. He takes a nap and I did the thing. I went through his phone. Now I know it‚Äôs not good to snoop but I‚Äôve done it before. I‚Äôd never found anything to suggest he had ever cheated on me, especially because I was suspicious when we first broke up over long distance in September 23. This time when I looked through his phone I typed in ‚Äútinder‚Äù on Instagram messages and a bunch of messages came up. Now whatever was from before we started dating or when we were broken up is not my business, but I found a bunch of messages dated February 2023, when we were together and doing long distance. And most of the messages were on 14 Feb aka Valentine‚Äôs Day. Pretty much the same copy paste message to like 15 girls saying that he saw their profiles on tinder and asked to meet for coffee. I felt sick. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should bring it up or keep it to myself and let it go. Tbh I would have forgiven it because it was 2 years ago, it was just some messages and I‚Äôm not a perfect person either. When we did long distance it was really hard. And in previous long distance relationships I made mistakes too. But when he woke up I couldn‚Äôt act normal. I asked him again causally and he denied. Then we had to get on a train and I was so anxious and quiet. He kept asking me what‚Äôs wrong and I kept telling him to drop it. I had no idea what to do. Finally I told him I didn‚Äôt like the way he responded when I asked him the question earlier. I asked him again if he ever had tinder when we were long distance, if he ever cheated on me. He looked me in my eyes and swore he‚Äôd never done that, going on about how he was with me and why would he want anyone else. Then he opens Instagram and I took his phone and typed in tinder in the messages so they pulled up. I opened one dated 14 Feb 2023. We both looked at it. He went quiet. I legit had no idea what to do so I just put on music and ignored him for a bit to stay calm. After a while I asked him if he had anything to say. He said he completely forgot about it, it meant nothing, it was a momentary lapse of judgement. He also insisted it was 2 years ago, w have broken up and gotten back together since then, so many things have changed, he‚Äôs changed. That is was a stupid mistake in the moment because of the lack of physical fulfillment during long distance. I get it. It was hard for me too and like I said I‚Äôm not perfect either. But the lying was happening present day. I asked why he lied and he said because it meant nothing and he forgot about it and he didn‚Äôt want to spoil our relationship. I asked him again if he ever cheated on me. Then I felt he was acting weird again, I can tell when something is up. So I went back to listening to my music. I wasn‚Äôt going to get mad or worked up, he needed to say it himself. We reach the train station and I got off. He was caught up to me and stopped me and said that there were the messages I saw but nothing happened. But the night of 14 Feb, he went out with a girl. It was a mutual friend that he somewhere knew, they went for a drink and they kissed and that was all and he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheat‚Äù on me. My jaw dropped to the floor. I was like WTF. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was real, then I started laughing (that‚Äôs just how I react it‚Äôs like a nervous tic idk). Then I tried to go back to being calm. I asked him a bunch of questions about it, like if he ever saw her again, if anyone else knew etc. non and no and no. I asked him if I did the same thing, would he be hurt? If I went out with another man tomorrow and kissed him, would he consider it cheating? He got the message. Admitted that it was cheating and that he was very sorry, but it didn‚Äôt mean anything he felt regret immediately. I asked him more importantly why did he lie. He gave the same reasons. We were going back home and I had no idea what to do. I just tried to stay calm and zen. Too tired for this shit. Went home, took a shower, popped some melatonin and got into bed. He joined me and said he wanted to talk. I asked him again if there was anything else, were there any other times that he cheated on me? He insisted no. Also like I said, I‚Äôve snooped through his phone a bunch and never found any evidence of cheating, especially since we got back together last year. And he has been really good to me. I asked him a lot of serious questions like if he felt he was mature enough to be in a committed relationship etc. he said he was sorry that he did it and regrets it, and especially because things have been going so well and we were going to officially move into together. I told him I was sorry too, but he brought this on by cheating, even if it was once 2 years ago, and lying now. 

 I stayed calm through all of it, he said he was freaked out by how calm I was acting lol. Said he wants to be with me no matter what, that he was sorry and that he was stupid and selfish. I said I need time to figure out what I wanted. This was Sunday. We went to sleep, the next morning I left for work before he woke up. He called and texted me, sent me a long apology message. I do think it is genuine. I think he genuinely regrets it and is very sorry. I told him I need time to figure out what I want, if I want to break up or not. But that the trust is broken and that if we want to make this work, the trust needs to be rebuilt. I don‚Äôt want to have to be suspicious of him, it‚Äôs not healthy for either of us. I told him I‚Äôm going to stay at my place for a bit. Later that night we spoke over the phone, it‚Äôs started off cordial enough. Then I got mad, I couldn‚Äôt keep my cool anymore. I asked him again if there was anything else, he said the girl he‚Äôd gone out with on 14 Feb - he also went to third with her. At this point I was laughing again. He lied again by not telling me the full truth the night before. I started having a go at him, insulting and berating him. Not proud of it. He took it all, didn‚Äôt defend himself. Then I felt bad hearing how sad his voice sounded and then switched to crying, and then back to insulting him, and on and on. Not very healthy. Finally I said I‚Äôve thought about it and it‚Äôs not my responsibility to rebuilt the trust because I didn‚Äôt break it. If he still wants to be with me he needs to prove himself, because I deserve better. Made it clear to him that he doesn‚Äôt have to if he doesn‚Äôt want to, he‚Äôs a grown man and he can decide what to do with his life. I won‚Äôt force him to chase after me but I won‚Äôt just walk back into his life and let things go back to normal, as much as I would like to, because I have to stand up for myself and set boundaries. He said he understood and he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else and he is willing to work for it and do whatever it takes to win my trust back. Not sure how he‚Äôs gonna do that but let‚Äôs see. 

I didn‚Äôt see him today. I will see him tomorrow evening, then I‚Äôm flying home for 2 weeks to be with my family. We will have space and I think that‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs hard to stay away from him and not have dinner together and sleep together when he lives so nearby, and being around him will probably cloud my judgement. 

He seems resolute in winning me back, and I want him to. I want him to fight for me, to show me how much he‚Äôs willing to do to keep me in his life. He knows he‚Äôs fucked up and my heart is broken. I know it was a long time ago but he also lied presently. I get why he didn‚Äôt want to tell me. It‚Äôs not easy to tell someone you‚Äôre seeing that you betrayed them and then probably ruin the relationship. It‚Äôs easier to lie to keep the relationship blissful. But he messed up by making the mistakes he made. And if I had never snooped through his phone he probably would have never told me. I can tell he‚Äôs also sorry he got caught, but I genuinely do think he regrets it. But my trust is broken. He‚Äôs told me there‚Äôs nothing else but I don‚Äôt believe it. And when I go away for two weeks what will he get up to? Probably nothing, he said he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else and I believe that. But it‚Äôs hard to take his word for it when now all I can think about is finding out that there was more shit and not being mentally prepared for it. 

I know he wants be back together and I want to be with him too. But I don‚Äôt know what is best for me. For now I‚Äôve decided to just take it day by day and see how he acts. He said he will work to win me back, so I guess I just wait and see what he does? 

I‚Äôve never been in this situation before, I‚Äôve never been cheated on. And the circumstances are a bit messy, I know it was 2 years ago. When we were broken up we were both seeing other people. Those times were complicated. But cheating on me on Valentine‚Äôs Day?? Bffr, the only other day that would be worse would be to cheat on me on my birthday.

I also feel like even if he does everything right and does the most to win me back, what if I just can‚Äôt let go of this? I am actively willing to work on it, but I don‚Äôt know how. Would also love advice from someone who stayed with their partner after they betrayed them, especially if things ended up getting better. How do you move forward? 

My mind changes constantly through the day. One moment I think, fuck this, I‚Äôm young and hot and I should just go back to being single. Or that there are better options out there. But I‚Äôve always believed that having the mindset of always thinking there‚Äôs something better can be toxic. And people make mistakes. I‚Äôve made mistakes too. That doesn‚Äôt make us bad people automatically.Then I  think I wish should take a break for a month but breaks are notoriously messy and I don‚Äôt need more drama in my life. And besides, until this was all unearthed, I loved my relationship with him. He was my safe space, it was peaceful and positive, he encouraged me a lot. We have a nice life together, we support each others work, we gym together, we go to the farmers market on weekends. It‚Äôs very different to our relationship before in the previous city where we were still getting to know each other, seeing each other max twice a week, and when he left we‚Äôd only know each other 5 months. Now it‚Äôs been nearly 3 years, we know each other very well and things are serious. I think he has the capacity to be a good partner. But I don‚Äôt want to be a push over and run back to him. I want him to work for it, but I also don‚Äôt want to play games. 

As you can tell, my mind is going in all directions and I have no idea what to do. Advice greatly appreciated üôèüèΩ",0,1744760614.0,Infidelity,1,0.5,False

In December of 2024 I started having the symptoms listed below. I thought that they would subside but here we are in April and I‚Äôm still having them. 

I wake up with the feeling of food coming up my throat - I try not to eat late in the evening. Extreme flatulence & belching. Thick phlegm in throat. Most of the time it feels like something is in my throat so I am constantly clearing and swallowing to clear my throat.  I have a warm feeling in my throat/chest like I have a peppermint lozenge stuck. It feels like food is not passing through the esophagus in the sternum area. I get neck pain (sometimes in my left shoulder blade as well) from swallowing so much. My insides feel dry no matter how much water I drink. I get random bouts of diarrhea (could be unrelated). Overall I just feel crummy. 

I have tried the following medications:

Mucinex x1 week. Claritin x1 month. Pepcid 40mg BID x2 weeks. Omeprazole 40mg daily x1 month. Nasocort BID x 4 weeks. Nexium 40mg daily x2 weeks. Omeprazole 20mg BID + Pepcid 20mg qhs x2 weeks 

I have removed peppermint, coffee, dairy, gluten, acidic, fried and greasy foods from my diet and this has not made any improvement so far. 

2/24/25 cholecystectomy - no change in above symptoms. 

3/4/25 - Sed rate was elevated at 23. The CMP, CBC, TSH, vitamin D, vitamin B12 and CRP were all WNL.

3/12/25  - Positive ANA (pattern type cytoplasmic). The Rheumatoid factor, sed rate and CRP were all WNL. 

I was referred to GI for an endoscopy but can‚Äôt get in with them until June for a consultation only. 

I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy done 3/22/2022 which was essentially WNL. They said I had some inflammation in my stomach and removed an adenoma.  I was treated for H. Pylori 11/2022.

I‚Äôve been looking into what could cause my symptoms and the most common thing that keeps coming up is LPR.  I have also read that people who have Ehlers danlos can have a higher prevalence of LPR symptoms. 

All I know is that I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy with these symptoms and hope that you all have give me some insight on things that have helped you or tests that I should request to see if this is LPR.

I drank a couple cups per day for a couple weeks (with ginger as well as it potentially reduces CGRP release), and I am confident I felt better in those two weeks than I had in the last two years.  I got cocky during the second week though and started eating crackers and cheese with sausage, nachos after work, a few cookies here, real coffee in my morning chicory coffee etc. and got a rude awakening with a handful of minor bouts of vertigo (each bout only lasting a few minutes).  No big episode though, but I cut back on the tasty stuff as soon as the head was getting funky.   
That said, I am going to try some chrysanthemum extract as well as a Magnolia bark extract (the constituents of which, magnolol and honokiol, can (according to the google AI) affect the expression of proteins involved in CGRP signaling).   Fargesin, the substance in the chrysanthemum which may reduce CGRP activity, is also found in magnolia flowers which is why I was barking up that tree, however, all I could find was the bark which may also have some effect on CGRP via the magnolol and honokiol.

In today's increasingly noisy world,effective communication is paramount. Whether you're a remote worker juggling family demands, a call center employee handling numerous customer interactions, or a student focused on online classes, unwanted background noise can significantly hinder your ability to focus and be heard. Investing in a quality pair of headphones with a noise cancelling microphone is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity for clear and professional communication.

The benefits extend across various scenarios:

   **Enhanced Clarity:** Ensure the person on the other end hears you clearly, free from distractions like keyboard clicks, barking dogs, or coffee shop chatter with background noise reduction microphone headphones.
   **Improved Focus:** By eliminating distractions, you can concentrate better on the task at hand, whether it's participating in a conference call or mastering a new skill during an online course.

before diving into specific recommendations, it's crucial to understand the different types of noise cancellation technology available in headphones with a microphone:

### Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) uses microphones to detect ambient noise and than generates an ""anti-noise"" signal to cancel it out. This is notably effective at blocking out low-frequency sounds like engine hums or the rumble of traffic. active noise cancellation headphones microphone technology is typically found in higher-end models.

### Passive Noise Cancellation (PNC)

Passive Noise Cancellation (PNC) relies on the physical design of the headphones to block out external sound. This includes features like earcups that create a tight seal around the ears and materials that absorb sound waves.Sound isolation headphones microphone designs frequently enough employ PNC.

### Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC)

ENC microphone (Environmental Noise Cancellation) technology focuses specifically on reducing noise around the microphone, ensuring that your voice is transmitted clearly to the other party. This commonly involves algorithms that identify and suppress sounds like keyboard clicks, speech from nearby colleagues, or general office noise.AI noise cancelling goes a step further,using artificial intelligence to learn and adapt to different noise environments,providing even more effective noise reduction.

## What to Look for When Choosing Headphones with Noise Cancelling Microphone

Selecting the right headphones with noise cancelling microphone depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key factors to consider:

Review independent tests and user reviews to assess performance in different environments. Look for details on the type of noise cancellation technology used, such as ENC or AI noise cancelling.
   **Microphone Polar Pattern:** The microphone polar pattern determines the direction from which the microphone picks up sound. Unidirectional microphones are most sensitive to sound coming from directly in front of them, making them ideal for isolating your voice. Omnidirectional microphones pick up sound from all directions, which can be useful in certain situations but may also capture more background noise.
   **microphone frequency Response:** this refers to the range of frequencies the microphone can accurately capture.A wider frequency response generally results in a more natural-sounding voice.
*   **Microphone Sensitivity:** This indicates how well the microphone converts sound into an electrical signal. higher sensitivity means the microphone can pick up quieter sounds.*   **Boom Microphone:** A boom microphone positions the microphone closer to your mouth, improving voice clarity and reducing background noise. Detachable microphone headphones offer flexibility, allowing you to remove the boom mic when not needed. Adjustable microphone headphones can be positioned for optimal performance.   **Sidetone:** Sidetone allows you to hear your own voice in the headphones, preventing you from speaking too loudly or softly.### Audio Quality

   **Driver Size:** The driver size affects the overall sound quality of the headphones. Larger drivers typically produce richer, more detailed audio.
   **Frequency Response:** The frequency response of the headphones indicates the range of frequencies they can reproduce. A wider frequency response allows you to hear a broader range of sounds, from deep bass to crisp highs.
   **Impedance:** Impedance affects how much power the headphones require to produce sound. Lower impedance headphones are easier to drive with mobile devices, while higher impedance headphones may require a headphone amplifier for optimal performance.
   **Crystal Clear Audio:** Aim for a headphones microphone combination that delivers crystal clear audio for both listening and speaking.### Comfort and Design

   **Ergonomics:** Ensure the headphones are pleasant to wear for extended periods. Look for features like padded earcups, adjustable headbands, and lightweight designs. comfortable headphones microphone options are essential for long meetings or work sessions.

1k06hqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k06hqt/going_back_on_caffeine_after_10_weeks_without/,Going back on caffeine after 10 weeks without,"Recently I took 10 weeks off, and now for the past 3 weeks I've been having tea during the workweek and one cup of coffee on Saturdays. 

Why I went back 

1. Sleep was messed up. For some reason I was waking up every hour or two throughout the night. I've seen other people here going through the same thing.
2. Annoyed that I had to take a nap every day to feel normal.
3. I thought work would be more productive and I would be more motivated at work.
4. Boredom. I thought caffeine would make everything more interesting.

Reality

1. Sleep actually got worse. I now wake up more frequently at night and I'm much more tired in the morning.
2. Back on caffeine I don't need to nap but I still feel just as tired, it's just a more anxious kind of tired. I miss the naps.
3. Not more productive at work. Actually feel less productive and more easily distracted.
4. The interestingness of things has remained the same and I'm just as bored as before.

Other things:

1. Acid reflux came back, even with mostly tea.
2. My brain is working less efficiently. When I'm talking in work meetings I struggle more to find the best way to express things or find the right word to use.
3. Overall tiredness levels are way higher.
4. Anxiety that I forgot I had is back.
5. I originally wanted to go to having caffeine just once a week or maybe every other day. I'm apparently unable to do that.

So I think I've decided for me, life is better without caffeine. But I don't think caffeine is bad for everyone. I don't think it's that big of a deal to be dependent on caffeine if it's not negatively affecting other parts of your life. But after taking a break and going back on it I realized I just feel better without it.",4,1744760370.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

###Previously:



Victor Stone and Donna Morris were approached by the boss of their lab, Dr. Morah, to change the apocalyptic future that he saw using his new time viewer. At the same time, Ratattack returned and had control over the entire city, enforced by an army‚Äôs worth of humanoid robots called RATs Wanting to prepare for the inevitable conflict, he went back to the lab to try and simulate his own powers with the help of Donna.. Unfortunately, the lab was raided by RATs who stole Dr. Morah‚Äôs time viewer. Vic and Donna managed to narrowly avoid capture with the help of Gizmo, who was there to steal the time viewer for his mysterious employer. Unable to stop Ratattack by himself, Vic made a deal with Gizmo: help him steal the time viewer and he‚Äôll help take down Ratattack‚Ä¶

  
  


One week later‚Ä¶



Ratattack sat with his feet up on the dark oak desk, leaning back in his chair. He laughed for a moment at a video on his phone, then scrolled to the next one. A laptop sat in front of him, its screen closed, while a thin layer of dust covered much of the paperwork and shelves that lined the room. It was good to be in charge.



A knock came from outside of the office. He quickly scrambled to clean up his act, putting his phone away and adjusting his posture. He flipped open the laptop and opened a couple windows to various sites and programs.



‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù



A person in their late 30s walked in. Ratattack recognized them as the county prosecutor‚Ä¶ no that wasn‚Äôt right. The city attorney? No, a member of the city council? That didn‚Äôt feel right either. He wasn‚Äôt sure and decided to keep it vague. 



‚ÄúWhat can I do for you? I‚Äôm very busy so make it quick.‚Äù



‚ÄúI will. In short, what do you want us to do? You‚Äôve talked about what you want to happen, but we haven‚Äôt received any instructions on what to do differently.‚Äù



Ratattack winced, thankful for the mask. He‚Äôd have to get a list from someone so he wasn‚Äôt caught off guard next time this happened.



‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sending something out shortly. For now, just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù



They raised an eyebrow, but didn‚Äôt press him. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ Thanks.‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course. Close the door on your way out.‚Äù



A few moments later, the door was gently shut. Ratattack put his feet back on the desk with a gentle thud, then took his phone out again. It was good to be in charge.



‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô



Late at night, Vic‚Äôs apartment.



Vic, Donna and Mikron sat across from each other on the couch. Mikron had called them over, or more accurately, invited himself over, after a week of planning their next moves. He pulled out some papers from his backpack and handed them over to Vic and Donna.



‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been working on. Pretty sure that building is where they moved the machine to. It‚Äôs the only place that Ratattack has been consistently going. Well, other than what I assume is his house and city hall. It‚Äôs also heavily guarded, way more than either of those other two places.‚Äù



Vic set his paper down on the table. ‚ÄúSeems pretty reasonable. When do you want to get it?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot yet. We‚Äôve got a little more to do first. How‚Äôs your project going?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Donna explained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve cut some weight off even our last prototype but it‚Äôs still too heavy and power hungry to really be a practical replacement to Vic‚Äôs powers.‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs sort of what I thought. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinning. Before we can take out Ratattack, we need to take out the RATs. And you need some sort of viable replacement to your powers. I‚Äôm going to take over on that front. Which leaves you two to take out the RATs. I‚Äôve got a couple places narrowed down. Just scout them out then we can take them out together. Questions?‚Äù



Vic raised his hand. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm not super excited for you to know how my tech works. Can‚Äôt you scout those places out?‚Äù  
  


Mikron scoffed. ‚ÄúOf course I could. But you two have made pretty much no progress in a week. So it‚Äôs my turn. And who cares if I know how this stuff works? Whatever you‚Äôre doing here is pretty basic. Now if it was the stuff you had before‚Ä¶ Then I‚Äôd get your hesitancy.‚Äù



‚ÄúFine.‚Äù



‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt try and break into our lab‚Äôs stuff okay? We don't need anyone asking questions why you‚Äôre there.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôll be like a ghost, promise,‚Äù Mikron said with a grin. 



‚ÄúSo, how do you expect us to take out all the RATs? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs going to be some kill switch just sitting on a table,‚Äù Donna said.



‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôve got another idea. I don‚Äôt think he actually has very many of them. We‚Äôve never seen more than two of them at once and I don‚Äôt think he has many more than that.‚Äù



Vic nodded, understanding. ‚ÄúSo you want us to stop production so he can‚Äôt get more.‚Äù



‚ÄúBingo.‚Äù 



Gizmo pulled out a notebook page from his bag and set it on the table. 



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a couple spots I think you can work from there. Scout them out and tell me what you see.‚Äù



Vic grabbed the paper and scanned it. They all seemed reasonable enough.



‚ÄúNow, what‚Äôs for dinner? I‚Äôm starving.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, Donna and I were going to go out for dinner. Hadn‚Äôt exactly had much time together since this whole thing started.‚Äù



Mikron‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúOoh, that sounds great, where are we going?‚Äù



Donna got up and walked to the fridge. ‚ÄúOn second thought, let‚Äôs just stay in.‚Äù

  
  


‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô



The next morning, Vic and Donna set out. The list Gizmo gave them had four places and Vic was surprised that it was even that high. To make robots of that size they‚Äôd need a large amount of space and there were only so many places that could fit something of that size. So, Vic and Donna agreed to start with the biggest location - a set of warehouses on the south side of the city. 



They were in a veritable ocean of asphalt with warehouses floating in the middle like an  archipelago. Some of them were converted into offices or storage units and others just lay abandoned and unused. Thankfully, all the warehouses were well labeled with their street address and after a few minutes of walking, the two of them found their spot. The building was massive, its white metal frame could‚Äôve encompassed an entire city block. They could hear a whir of activity coming from inside but not a single RAT in sight.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you think? Mikron said this place was listed as unoccupied, but they‚Äôre obviously doing something here. I think we found our place.‚Äù



Donna nodded. ‚ÄúWant to check it out? If we could confirm it or even shut it down now, that‚Äôd be huge.‚Äù



Vic paused, unsure. ‚ÄúDid you bring any gear or anything? I‚Äôve got nothing on me. Doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any RATs here, but I‚Äôm sure there's some guards inside somewhere.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, I've got a couple things. I think I can take care to say‚Ä¶ two of them? Total?How about this: play it safe, see what there is. If there's more than two, we get out of here.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat sounds fair.‚Äù



Donna snuck over to the door, a little cloth tunnel hanging off the side of the warehouse. She tried the handle and found it unlocked. 



‚ÄúOverconfidence or a trap?‚Äù



‚ÄúCould be anything or nothing. If we‚Äôre going for it, we‚Äôve got to go for it.‚Äù



Donna turned the handle and stepped in with Vic just behind her. There were no lights in the cloth tunnel, but daylight shone through it and the electric lights of the warehouse beckoned them forwards. They met the challenge and were immediately accosted.



‚ÄúHalt. This is a restricted area. Leave immediately.‚Äù A RAT stepped in front of them, blocking their path into the warehouse. This one looked unfinished; its circuitry was still exposed with some of the protective plates missing.


*‚ÄòGuess we found the spot.‚Äô*



Vic tried to peer around the RAT to see their numbers, but couldn‚Äôt see much of anything. He looked over to Donna who nodded. 


*‚ÄòSo we‚Äôre doing this.‚Äô*



Vic walked up to the RAT with a worried look on his face. ‚ÄúMan am I glad to see you. Our car broke down outside and we were wondering if we could get a jump‚Ä¶‚Äù



The RAT looked at him, skeptical. ‚ÄúYou cannot. Leave imme- ‚Äù



Donna sprung into action, lunging towards the RAT‚Äôs left knee joint and shooting it point blank with some sort  of grey gel, then doing the same thing to its foot, attaching it to the ground. She kicked its left leg, knocking it to the ground with a thud. She blasted it another couple times, firmly fastening it down.



Vic stepped into the warehouse and immediately recognized it for what it was: a factory. Its production was minimally operational at the moment, but at its peak it looks like it would be able to have four or five parallel lines to mass produce RATs. There was only equipment for one line at the moment but what it had was already impressive. It looked like it was a fully autonomous operation with robotic arms and conveyor belts powering the entire thing. 



An even less complete RAT started running over to Vic, snapping him back into focus.This RAT‚Äôs inside was fully exposed, like it was being worked on mere moments before they got here. The blue, black, and red wires were hanging out of its  chest cavity, making it look more like an alien humanoid than a muscular bouncer like the complete ones.



‚ÄúDonna, you got any more of that stuff?‚Äù



She nodded, then stopped, frowning. ‚ÄúUh.. no. The cartridge leaked and now I can‚Äôt reload it‚Ä¶ Buy me some time?‚Äù



‚ÄúSure, no problem. Just stall the killer robot. Easy.‚Äù



Vic grabbed one of the RAT pieces - Vic assumed it was a leg - from the assembly line and swung it at the RAT as it approached him. But it grabbed it out of the air and swung a punch at Vic. He ducked out of the way and grabbed another RAT leg from the line just in time for the RAT to throw Vic‚Äôs previous weapon at him, which he blocked with the new one. 



But the RAT took the chance to close the distance and kicked Vic back as he blocked the projectile. He doubled over, winded for a second, but quickly recovered and rolled under the conveyor belt to create some distance. He looked around for anything he could use as a weapon but these belts were empty. On a nearby support pillar, he spotted a fire extinguisher and he ran over to grab it. He ripped it from the wall and sprayed it at the RAT before chucking it at its legs. This time, he charged in right after and tackled it to the ground. 



He could feel the motors resisting, but with a metallic snap, he sent it to the ground. The RAT started to lift itself up but Vic grabbed the fire extinguisher again and knocked it back down. He grabbed a handful of wires out of its chest and threw them to the ground for good measure as he heard it lose power.



‚ÄúWell, looks like you didn‚Äôt even need me.‚Äù



‚ÄúFigured I‚Äôd let you clean it up,‚Äù Vic said, panting. 



Donna looked like she doubted the need for it, but sprayed it with the adhesive anyway as Vic caught his breath. 



A few moments later, Vic was on his feet and they started to dig around the factory. Thankfully it wasn't running right now, but it looked like it could turn on at any moment. Or at least it could've before the damage that Vic and the RAT caused during their fight. As he walked along the assembly lines, he marveled at the amount of resources required to build a place like this. He figured it would easily cost a couple million dollars for the equipment alone, let alone the materials, space and talent needed to develop these things. Then, something caught his eye. 



At the end of the factory, he spied a small roof just before the steel wall of the warehouse. It sort of looked like it was a foreman's area or a break room if this place had human workers. He motioned for Donna to come over, but she seemed preoccupied by the massive circuit breaker and transformer panel that powered the factory and he wasn't sure if she noticed or not.His curiosity got the better of him and he went in without making sure.



The office looked like it had never been organized since it was built. Papers, coffee cups, drawings, prototypes and things that Vic couldn't even start to guess the use for were strewn about the large room. The office had a stale smell and was dimly lit by a couple of light bulbs hanging loosely from the ceiling. But what really surprised Vic was who he saw typing away on a table on the far side.



 Dr Morah.



He looked like he was one of his creative bursts so much so that he hadn‚Äôt heard the fighting or Vic walk in. There was a fire in his eyes that Vic hadn‚Äôt seen him have in months, if ever. 



Vic walked over near him and knocked on a nearby table.



‚ÄúDr. Morah? What are you doing here?‚Äù



‚ÄúVic? I‚Äôm surprised you came around on this, but it‚Äôs a pleasant surprise. This is where I‚Äôm changing the world.‚Äù



Vic was fairly sure what was going on here as soon as he saw the Dr., but there were no doubts in his mind now.



‚ÄúSo, you made the RATs? All this, that‚Äôs you?‚Äù



Dr. Morah chucked. ‚ÄúWho else? I told you I was going to change the world and what better way to do it than to start in the city I live in.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really the part people would have a problem with. And change isn‚Äôt always better.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnything would be better than the future I saw. And if you and Donna found another way, well that‚Äôs great too.‚Äù 

  


‚ÄúAnd what's changed from all this? Was it worth it?‚Äù



Dr. Morah frowned. ‚ÄúNothing. And that is what I have been trying to figure out. Why doesn‚Äôt the future change with what I do?‚Äù



‚ÄúWho knows. Really though, who knows? Maybe we‚Äôre not even looking at the right timeline or maybe everything we were going to do, we did anyway.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be right. That would be mean‚Ä¶ No, that can‚Äôt be right. I‚Äôm sure it will just take time for the change to show‚Ä¶‚Äù 



Dr. Morah flipped through a notebook before giving up and throwing it at the wall behind him.



‚ÄúWhere is the time viewer now?  Maybe we can check now‚Ä¶‚Äù



Dr. Morah‚Äôs face turned darker than  Vic had ever seen as he spoke with venom. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone. Ratattack took it to keep it safe but he hasn‚Äôt let me see it since.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo what was the plan then? Make him an army then just see what happens?  You‚Äôre lucky he hasn't used it to really hurt anyone yet.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ no. I needed to see if the future could be changed in any material, concrete way. And Ratattack‚Äôs resurgence of popularity just happened to coincide. I met up with him and gave him the tools to secure himself with the condition that he would listen to me and help me change the future. If everything stayed the same with these conditions, I knew that I would have to find something truly drastic.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut he has the machine and doesn‚Äôt care what you have to say, does he?‚Äù



‚Äú... No. He took my machine and won‚Äôt pick up my calls.‚Äù



Realization started to spread across his face. ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did I make a mistake?‚Äù 



Vic  shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Only you can really decide that. But I can't bring myself to trust him, even before what you said.‚Äù 



Dr. Morah looked like he was  about to say something, but he stopped himself as recognition lit up his eyes.He scrambled back to where he threw the notebook and began to read. 



‚Äú‚ÄòVictor walks into the factory. He talks, accusing me of something I appear to be unable to understand‚Ä¶‚Äô I wrote down what I could remember from the machine‚Ä¶ So even this was prewritten?‚Äù



He frowned and went back to his seat, dejected.



Donna stepped into the lab and stopped in confusion at seeing Dr. Morah. 



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he doing here - oh. He made all this?‚Äù



Vic nodded. ‚ÄúBut it's sort of complicated.It's just a scheme to change the world. He‚Äôs not really doing it for him if that makes sense.You take care of the factory?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah. This place won‚Äôt be making any more RATs for a long time.‚Äù

 

Suddenly, Dr.  Morah lit up with delight. ‚ÄúDonna's here? Donna‚Äôs here!‚Äù



He started to laugh.



‚ÄúDr. Morah, are you okay?‚Äù Vic asked.



‚ÄúMore than okay, Vic. I didn‚Äôt write that she would be here‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt you see? The future must have changed!‚Äù



‚ÄúI,uh, that‚Äôs great,‚Äù Donna stammered out.



But he wasn‚Äôt listening. Dr. Morah was scribbling furiously across pages and pages of notes while occasionally writing on a clean notebook on the other side. ‚ÄúIf this changed‚Ä¶ then what else can I do? I can do this. I‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ I guess we should just give him some space. Let‚Äôs report back to Gizmo for now.‚Äù



Vic nodded but turned back to Dr. Morah has left. 



‚ÄúDr. Morah‚Ä¶ I just hope you know itgs not in any one person to save the world or fix the future or any of that. It‚Äôs on all o fus.>



Dr. Morah didn‚Äôt acknowledge Vics‚Äôs words at all, but Vic really hoped some part of him would take them to heart.



‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô ‚öô



It turned out that Gizmo wanted nothing from them. He was deep in his own work and only answered his phone for long enough to tell them to leave him alone and not talk to him until he reached out.



Instead, Vic and Donna decided to get a nice lunch at a cafe just a couple blocks from where Vic lived. At the last street corner before the cafe, they were stopped at a red light for a few moments. Just as the crosswalk turned to let them walk, a voice came from behind them.



‚ÄúIs that you, Victor?‚Äù The voice was quiet and mousy, but with a hint of passion and fire behind it, like the embers of a fire waiting to be ignited.



Vic turned to face the voice and saw a man about his age with dark skin a bit cooled toned than his weakly standing with a cane. 



‚ÄúYeah? Can I help you?‚Äù



‚ÄúProbably. I‚Äôm Ratattack. Can we talk?‚Äù 



Vic took a step backwards and Donna tensed up. ‚ÄúWhy are you here? What do you want?‚Äù



‚ÄúCan we sit down? I‚Ä¶ I have never had a strong constitution. But I promise you I mean you no harm.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything to say to you after what you put me through. After what you threatened to do, after you‚Äôve taken control of the town and done nothing you said you would‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúThat was not me. Those first things, yes. I did place fake bombs, claim I killed your sister ‚Ä¶. all that. I did some things you may find reprehensible but I have no regrets. But I am not in control of this town. That is another man who is using my image for his own gains.‚Äù



Now Vic was interested. ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs talk. There‚Äôs a cafe just a block from here that Donna and I were going to anyway. Donna, you okay with that?‚Äù



She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious what he has to say too.‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you both. I don‚Äôt have much to say but‚Ä¶ I feel you need to know.‚Äù



The three of them started off towards the cafe with Vic keeping a watchful eye on Ratattack the entire walk. He wasn‚Äôt sure what he was hoping Ratattack would say and didn‚Äôt trust him for a moment, but some part of him and the way he spoke made him want to despite it all. Something about the man he saw in front of him‚Ä¶ he just felt genuine. 



When they got to the cafe, the three of them sat by a short table in the back corner. The cafe was brightly lit and modern, but in that back corner, the feeling was dark and heavy.



‚ÄúSo. Let‚Äôs start with an easy one. How did you even find me just now?‚Äù



Ratattack chuckled, before thanking the waiter for bringing him his tea. 

‚ÄúWould you believe me if I told you it was truly just a coincidence?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot for a moment.‚Äù



He chuckled again. ‚ÄúWell it was. I had wanted to speak with you since this matter began; today just happened to be the day our paths crossed.‚Äù



Vic frowned. ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs just move on from that. I really can't believe that but I don‚Äôt see that going anywhere. Let‚Äôs move on to you. What do you have to say for yourself? About everything you put me through?‚Äù 



‚ÄúLike I said outside, I don‚Äôt regret it. Maybe I went too far, but people aren‚Äôt willing to listen to fancy words and speeches. They need action. I did what I thought was best for people, just like you do. I don‚Äôt make the choices you would make in my situation, and you don‚Äôt do what I would. But I respect that you want what‚Äôs best for people and perhaps some part of you feels the same.‚Äù



‚Äú... If you‚Äôre just here to gloat‚Ä¶‚Äù Donna started.



‚ÄúI am not. Quite the opposite; I‚Äôm here to admit I was defeated, as I mentioned before. I want to give you a warning: the man in that costume is not me. I had goals and boundaries. He does not. Do not assume you know fully what you are dealing with.‚Äù



‚ÄúWho is he then?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. All I know is that after you and I fought, I hung up the mask and the suit for a while in a secure place. Perhaps you guessed it, but that outfit gave me the strength to fit you that my unassisted body does not possess. Regardless, eventually I went back to check on it and it was gone. I have been to his speeches. He might use the same words as I did, but he has no meaning. No hope for a better tomorrow. It‚Äôs all to hide his own cynicism and desire to benefit himself.‚Äù



Vic ran his hands down his face. It could never be simple.



‚ÄúSo what do you want from me?‚Äù



‚ÄúI would like you to take him down. Beyond that‚Ä¶ nothing. I just felt you deserved to know.‚Äù



He grabbed his cane and stood up with a wobble.



‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it then? Who even are you?‚Äù



Ratattack shook his head. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. It never did. I doubt we‚Äôll meet again, Victor.‚Äù



He walked slowly out of the cafe, stopping only to thank the cafe‚Äôs staff again. Vic wanted to stop him, to ask him to apologize, to demand he tell him who he was so he can pay for what he did. But he couldn‚Äôt. He didn‚Äôt know why, but he couldn't.

For the past year & a half, I've been receiving calls, messages, and coffee chats filled with encouragement, brilliant suggestions, and kind words about our journey. 

To everyone who checked in or offered a kind word, Thank You. 

Today, I can finally stop being vague and share what's kept me buried in code and story structures instead of showing up at the usual writer meetups.





Introducing: www.Script.Movie. Born from the messy, beautiful chaos of screenwriting.





It started as a personal fix for a familiar feeling I had: overwhelming paralysis that comes when staring at infinite great possibilities, and no clear way forward. 

We became a small team of confidantes, script consultant (another Damian, long story), two developers who secretly harbored great screenwriting potential of their own, and me, Damian 2.





Long story short, the tool is designed for moments when:



You have brilliant research, that just won't seem to transform into compelling scenes

Your characters feel alive in your head, but malleable on the page

You've lost track of some of the great notes written somewhere in the software

You need to crystalize the relationships between characters, plots, and themes when explaining your story to someone else



We've watched our early few users finish scripts they've been stuck on for months. One writer finally completed her complex family drama after three abandoned drafts. Another transformed his overwhelming fantasy world into focused, character-driven scenes





This isn't a tool for everyone. If you're happy with your current process, that's awesome. But if you get stuck between your grand vision and actual pages, we are building this for you.



This is deeply personal for us. We built this because we needed it ourselves. Every feature came from a real screenwriting problem one of us faced. There‚Äôs way more we‚Äôre excited to create



If what we're creating speaks to you, we'd love to have you along for this journey. The site is live at www.script.movie, and we're growing its community one writer at a time. If you find value in what we're building, consider subscribing for early access. Your support will help us keep refining and expanding what Script.Movie can do.



P.S, The UI is messy. Also, inside the app, you‚Äôll still see the old domain: app.watzen. We‚Äôre going to transition soon",1,1744760006.0,u_Watzen_software,0,1.0,False

I was awake most of the night. Its embarrasing I cant even enjoy one glass now? Maybe it's what i needed to experience to keep going, but I don't know if i  should reset the clock now. Maybe just say ""coffee free""(and 1 pepsi on day 8). 12 hours later in the morning my heart is still pounding and feels like a sligh headache.

1k065uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1k065uz/the_fish_and_the_fury/,The Fish and the fury,"Fulton Street wasn‚Äôt just a street in our family‚Äîit was a kingdom, and Uncle Santo was its undisputed king. The youngest of the seven Greco siblings, he‚Äôd clawed his way up from Sicilian immigrant roots to own the ice company that kept half of Brooklyn‚Äôs fish from turning into yesterday‚Äôs news. He was a broad-shouldered, barrel-chested man with a voice like a foghorn and a wallet fatter than anyone else‚Äôs in the clan. Then there was my father, Frank, the oldest of the brood‚Äîdignified, dressmaker extraordinaire, and card-carrying member of the ILGWU. Pop was the family‚Äôs moral compass, a man who‚Äôd stitch you a three-piece suit and a sermon in the same afternoon.
The two of them were oil and water, or maybe espresso and grappa‚Äîperfectly fine apart, explosive together. Santo loved his wife, his kids, and his grandkids, sure, but he also loved a good side dish of dames. Pop, devoted to Ma‚ÄîZina, the saint of our kitchen‚Äîsaw it as his sacred duty to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù Santo‚Äôs wandering ways. Every Saturday morning, that correction played out like a vaudeville act in our Brooklyn dining room.
The doorbell chimed at ten on the dot, a sound as reliable as the church bells on Sunday. In strode Uncle Santo, arms full of fresh fish from the Fulton Fish Market, wrapped in brown paper and smelling like the sea. ‚ÄúZina, my angel!‚Äù he‚Äôd bellow, planting a kiss on Ma‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúFlounder today‚Äîcaught it myself with my bare hands!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean you bought it with your bare wallet,‚Äù Pop would mutter, folding his newspaper with a snap.
Ma, apron on and espresso pot bubbling, would set out the biscuits‚Äîthose hard little Italian ones that could double as doorstops‚Äîwhile Santo plopped into a chair, his appetite already growling louder than he did. That Saturday was no different, at least not at first. We gathered around the table‚Äîme, Pop, Ma, and Santo‚Äîsipping coffee so strong it could wake up a coma patient.
Santo leaned back, brushing crumbs off his shirt. ‚ÄúYou hear about my brother-in-law, Tony? Poor slob kicked the bucket last week. Broke as a joke, too. I had to pay for the whole damn funeral‚Äîcasket, flowers, the works. Me! Generous Santo, huh?‚Äù He grinned, waiting for the applause, maybe a medal.
Pop‚Äôs face went from Sundaycalm to Saturday storm in half a heartbeat. His coffee spoon clattered onto the saucer. ‚ÄúYou paid for Tony‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù he said, voice low, like thunder rolling in.
‚ÄúYeah, Frank, I did! What‚Äôs it to ya?‚Äù Santo puffed out his chest, proud as a peacock.
Pop‚Äôs chair scraped back an inch. ‚ÄúHow about when Ma died, you son of a bitch? Your own mother! You made your sisters‚Äîyour sisters, who don‚Äôt have a pot to piss in‚Äîpay their share of the funeral expenses. And you, Mr. Ice King, didn‚Äôt offer a dime to help ‚Äòem out!‚Äù His finger jabbed the air like a sewing needle. ‚ÄúYou got some nerve sittin‚Äô here braggin‚Äô about Tony when you stiffed your own flesh and blood!‚Äù
The room went quiet, except for the hiss of the espresso pot. Ma froze mid-biscuit, and I held my breath, knowing this was about to get good. Santo‚Äôs face turned the color of the flounder he‚Äôd brought‚Äîpale, then pink, then a deep, furious red. He stood up, slow and deliberate, like a bull sizing up a matador.
‚ÄúI hate everyone,‚Äù he growled, voice shaking the biscuit plate. ‚ÄúI hate my wife. I hate my kids. I hate my grandkids. I hate you, Frank. And I‚Äôm leavin‚Äô‚Äîright now‚Äîand I ain‚Äôt never comin‚Äô back!‚Äù He stomped toward the door, each step rattling the framed pictures on the wall. ‚ÄúNever again, you hear me? Never!‚Äù
Pop wasn‚Äôt done. ‚ÄúGood riddance, you cheap bastard! And next time, pay your sisters‚Äô share!‚Äù he hollered as Santo yanked the door open. ‚ÄúYou owe ‚Äòem that much!‚Äù
The door slammed shut, a punctuation mark on Santo‚Äôs grand exit. Ma sighed, picking up a biscuit and dunking it in her coffee. ‚ÄúFrank, you‚Äôre gonna give yourself a heart attack one of these days.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll give me a heart attack first,‚Äù Pop grumbled, but his eyes softened as he sipped his espresso. ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs got a heart of ice to match his business.‚Äù
We all knew Santo‚Äôd be back next Saturday, fish in hand, like nothing ever happened. So you can imagine my lack of surprise when, seven days later, the doorbell rang at ten sharp. I peeked out the window‚Äîthere was Uncle Santo, fish bundle cradled like a baby, grinning like he hadn‚Äôt just declared war on the whole family.
He waltzed in, kissed Ma on the cheek, and then‚Äîbefore Pop could get a word out‚Äîleaned over and planted a big, wet smacker on Pop‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúMorning, Frank! Flounder again‚Äîbest catch of the week!‚Äù
Pop blinked, caught somewhere between a yell and a laugh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lunatic, you know that?‚Äù he said, but he didn‚Äôt push Santo away. Ma just shook her head and fired up the espresso pot, the biscuits hitting the table like clockwork.
They‚Äôd fight again, sure as the sun came up. Pop would ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù Santo would storm out, and the fish would keep coming every Saturday. But underneath the yelling, the swearing, the biscuit crumbs‚Äîthere was love, thick as Ma‚Äôs marinara sauce. Santo might‚Äôve been a man of the streets, and Pop a man of principle, but they were brothers first.

I can't stop eating the Smokey Bacon chips. They should honestly come with a warning label.

I made things extra difficult by basically telling u/Minimum_Drawing4773 ‚Äúsurprise me,‚Äù and wow did they  deliver! The package showed up today, packed with three kinds of chips that all look dangerously good: Smokey Bacon, All-Dressed, and Fries ‚Äòn Gravy. As soon as I saw the bacon chips, I tore them open like a raccoon. They‚Äôre even better than they sound. I had to stop myself from opening all three bags at once. Soon ...

Our son immediately zeroed in on the candy (of course). We made a deal to try one treat each night as a family. Coffee Crisp is first in line, and I‚Äôm excited - I‚Äôve never had it before. We have regular KitKats here in the US, but *Chunky* KitKats? Nope. I don't know why they don't sell them here, but I love it. Also, Canadian Smarties! I used to live in Australia, so now I‚Äôm feeling some serious childhood nostalgia. Fingers crossed they taste like the ones I remember. I bet they do!

I absolutely love the Canadian keychain. It‚Äôs already found a home on our key rack, where it will serve as a tiny, polite reminder that we *need* to visit Canada someday.

Ever find yourself stuck at work, daydreaming about that next upgrade? Or maybe you're on your commute (shoutout to fellow subway/bus gamers!) and want to quickly check which boss drops that BiS trinket you desperately need?

I ran into this exact situation way too often ‚Äì wanting to check loot tables but not being near my gaming PC. In-game addons like AtlasLoot are fantastic, but they don't help much when you're AFK.

That's why I decided to build¬†c**Loot** 2.0 for MoP again.  [https://mop.c70.ca/](https://mop.c70.ca/)

Here is the post for original TBC 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/m0t58q/atlasloot\_style\_tbc\_classic\_online\_database/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/m0t58q/atlasloot_style_tbc_classic_online_database/)  


**What is Cloot?**

Cloot is a simple, web-based WoW loot viewer. Think of it like a browser version of AtlasLoot. It lets you:

* Browse through various Dungeons and Raids.
* See the loot table for each specific boss.
* Check item details (stats, etc. -¬†*mention specifics if available*).
* Do it all from your phone, work computer (we won't tell your boss!), tablet, or any device with a web browser.

**Why did I make this?**

Honestly, the main motivation was to have a tool for those ""in-between"" moments:

* **The ""Work Slack"" Scenario:**¬†Quickly plan your gear goals during a sneaky coffee break.
* **The Commute Grind:**¬†Use that subway time productively by figuring out which instance to run next.
* **Any Downtime:**¬†Waiting for friends, during loading screens on another game, etc.

It's designed to be a quick and easy reference tool when you can't (or don't want to) log into WoW itself.

**Check it out here:**

[https://mop.c70.ca/](https://mop.c70.ca/)

**It's still a work in progress**, but the core functionality of browsing instances and boss loot is there. I'm really keen to hear what you all think!

* Is it useful for you?
* Any bugs or issues?

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated as I continue to develop it.

Thanks for taking a look, and happy looting!

**TL;DR:**¬†Made a web app called¬†**Cloot**¬†(https://mop.c70.ca/) that lets you browse WoW dungeon/raid boss loot outside the game, similar to AtlasLoot. Perfect for checking gear drops during work breaks, commutes, or any downtime. Let me know what you think!

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf!

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country.

  You all are amazing for sharing your knowledge.  
  We spent 5 nights in Uvita & 5 in La Tigra.  
   Highlights were
The Pineapple, lots of pineapple and coffee
The AirBnb in Uvita - Such value in an awesome place
Jungle ATV - exhilarating & educational 
Whales Tail really unique spot
Fuego brewery in Dominical 
Manuel Antonio - just amazing
Uvita falls total Costa Rica experience 
Nuayuca Falls hike absolutely beautiful 
Parcels restaurant love the view monkeys and coconut mojito
Uvita Bakery - awesome way to start the day
Eden Chocolate tour our guide was so much fun and the chocolate was so good
Bogarin night trail almost terrifying with the sounds and darkness.  Never going in the jungle at night again
Sky adventures zip lines and hike well done zip lines, super fast and safe.  We saw monkeys on the hike so worth the $
La Fortuna waterfall - beautiful and powerful 
Soda la hormiga
Los Lagos hot springs 
Mexicanal taco truck amazing pollo tacos with grilled pineapple mmm mmm

Go Pro‚Äôs are made for these adventures - bring one

Staying in La Tigra was tough cause it was 50 min away from La Fortuna and we ended up going there all 4 days we were there.   (We went the long route - cause car sickness sucks with kids)

Pura Vida Friends!
We will miss you Costa Rica

I have gotten multiple quotes from international relocation companies and narrowed it down to one. They quoted us $2,992 for a single lift van (1200 lbs., 185 cu. Ft, 87‚Äù x 87‚Äù x 47‚Äù). We are getting rid of nearly all furniture except one coffee table. I cannot get a sense of what will actually fit in the lift van. My husband and I argue over it all the time because I would much prefer to have 2 lift vans - quoted at $5,369. But he insists we get rid of everything and do not spend the money on this. It‚Äôs already a very expensive move and we need to cut costs as much as possible. However, we are moving with a dog, and the thought of having two flights with a dog, and 5+ suitcases sounds like an absolute nightmare to me and I‚Äôd much rather just pay the extra $2,500 to pack everything in a lift van and not worry about it during an already stressful travel week. 

I cannot get a sense of what actually fits into a lift van since the movers will be the ones boxing it up. I‚Äôve googled it but the results are all over the place. Normally I would just stuff as much as possible into a box, but they have to pack everything themselves due to customs issues and I imagine will use a lot more packaging and padding than I would. 

Things I would like to keep are:

- west elm coffee table
- LG computer monitor
- ceramic bird bath
- 4-6 medium sized ceramic planters
- at least 4-6 vases
- several pieces of artwork (all small or medium)
- dishes and glassware 
- pillows and sheets
- one set of curtains and curtain rods
- a few blankets and towels
- clothes (lots of it!) I don‚Äôt want to lug this around the airport but I have a large collection of clothing, bags, and shoes. I will try to downsize as much as possible but at this point it‚Äôs worth a lot of money and I‚Äôm fairly attached. 
- other sentimental items (books, photos)

TLDR: does anyone have before and after photos of what fit into their lift van? Like a before photos of all their items unpacked, and an after photo of what all fit in the lift van?",0,1744758346.0,expats,1,0.33,False

1k05q2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1k05q2r/mi_refusing_to_sign_a_pip_mi_usa/,"[MI] Refusing to sign a PIP MI, USA","Been at my job for about 2 years. Never been disciplined, verbally or written up or anything otherwise. Never even been in HR‚Äôs office unless it was helping with company events. Most recent performance review pegged me at ‚Äúsolid performance: meeting expectations appropriately‚Äù. 

I work at a chaotic company with my job as the ‚Äúcatch all‚Äù for many many other departments. I average (295 emails received, 175 emails outgoing) every single day. It is extremely high stress and fast paced. 

3 months ago a new manager started. She was not my cup of tea at all (loud and obnoxious to say the least) but she seemed nice enough. Things were going fine. 

On a Thursday, she sent me an email complementing what an amazing performer I am and how I have an a class attitude. 

The next day, a Friday, we had a one on one check in where she also verbally praised my attitude and performance. (Unfortunately this was face to face, and she failed to document this meeting in our company traceability site like she is supposed to.)

Monday- normal day at work. 

Tuesday- she and I are working from separate locations, and she and I have a few somewhat tense discussions throughout the day. Long story short, she made a mistake trying to speak on my behalf, and I corrected her, and by doing so she thought I was being disrespectful. 

Wednesday- I‚Äôm back in office. She won‚Äôt look at or acknowledge me, she sends me an email saying that she‚Äôs decided I need more training in other areas of the company and this is non negotiable. I was taken aback, I asked her to step into a meeting room. She began loudly berating me and my ‚Äúbad attitude‚Äù, was intentionally intimidating, said things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your boss, if I tell you to work at 10pm on a Friday night, you‚Äôre gunna do it!‚Äù At some point I told her, I am no longer comfortable having this conversation. I left the meeting. 

Thursday- in confidence, I went to HR and shared the many things that mgr had said to me the day before. I did not request mediation or anything at this point, I just wanted to sort of get on record that her behavior was inappropriate and unprofessional. 

Friday- she sends me some rude, curt emails trying to task me with some ridiculous asks. I roll my eyes because I see the flex happening. 

Mon-Fri following week- she‚Äôs out sick and we have no correspondence. 

Mon-Tues the next week, we are both in office but I am preparing to leave for a week and a half vacation the next day. I work quickly to wrap up as many tasks as I can so I don‚Äôt leave too much work for my team in my absence and I leave for a week and a half. 

Mon- I return to the office and bring fancy coffee for my entire team and manager as a thank you for the coverage. Team reports it was mostly uneventful other than a few ‚Äúvery minor‚Äù errors (ie, I had forgotten to save some thing in a shared folder and someone had to find it in a CRM database instead.) 

Monday afternoon- manager invites me to a ‚Äúquick chat‚Äù calendar invite. I go in and she informs me that I am being put on a PIP for ‚Äúseveral errors‚Äù that were discovered in my absence. I ask for specific examples, she says ‚Äúwhy? So you can formulate a defense?‚Äù

Clearly she is hostile and is not at all interested in understanding or supporting me at this point. She also says that my attitude is sour, I don‚Äôt respect her authority, and I‚Äôm lazy. (She asks us all to conjure up an idea of extra work we can take on, for free. I haven‚Äôt come up with one because last I checked, my KPIs were 20-30% higher than my teammates; and I legitimately don‚Äôt have time to just keep adding more and more work.) I say to her, I am very busy, let‚Äôs pull KPIs. She says no, those don‚Äôt indicate your workload at all. Wat. 

Then I say how am I supposed to communicate to you how I‚Äôm feeling with my bandwidth if you accuse me of not being honest, and won‚Äôt look at KPIs as validation? She says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd tread carefully, because if you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre too busy to take on extra tasks, you are never too busy to chat with your colleagues, or Flex Time to pick your kids up from school.‚Äù

It was a total of 5 days together in office between the day of my ‚Äúgreat attitude‚Äù and glowing review, to her telling me I‚Äôm getting a PIP for poor performance and bad attitude. 3 days, in fact, since I reported her behavior/creating a hostile work environment to HR. 

I feel this is a clear act of retaliation against me. I sat in the meeting today and she lied to my face, made up false allegations of things that I‚Äôve done, denied saying things that she 100% said, it was so manipulative and wild for me to see her putting on this way in front of other managers that I physically was having a trauma response. (Heart palpitations, sweating, whole body shaking.) She‚Äôs an unsafe person. 

I told the Director (her manager) that while I am open to improvement and working on some of the minor errors that I made before I left for vacation, I will not sign this document as I believe it was conjured in an act of retaliation against me while I was on vacation. The document says ‚Äúwe believe there may have been holes in your training and for this we take full responsibility‚Äù but then in the next paragraph outlines my behavior problems saying, ‚ÄúI often push back or refuse more work, or am last to volunteer, citing that I do not have time‚Äù. My head almost exploded. Now I am being punished for having boundaries?

I asked what do I do if I don‚Äôt sign. He said then your employment here is over. I said okay, well I‚Äôm not signing. Fire me. 

He said let‚Äôs revisit this in a few days when you‚Äôve had time to think about it. 

Here are the facts‚Ä¶.. either way, I am not returning there. New boss has created such a hostile work environment for me, made false allegations, I am uncomfortable even having to be near her. 

It would make my life (and my kids‚Äô) much less stressful if I am able to claim unemployment benefits in the interim while I search for another job. My daughter has a very expensive medication unfortunately that I cannot afford otherwise and I‚Äôm afraid of losing that. 

What recourse do i have? I don‚Äôt want to stay, but I can‚Äôt afford to risk leaving without unemployment pay. 

happy to answer any questions to clarify, this is a lot all at once and im typing from my phone

Edit- I also printed my original job description which has absorbed several tasks not originally in my job scope as the company has absorbed other roles and put the work on us. My work is similar to project management, but the ‚Äúadditional responsibilities as deemed necessary‚Äù catch all has included managing a stock room, packing weighing and shipping items, cleaning and dusting warehouse inventory, answering phones for the receptionist that was fired, etc. 

I also printed my positive reviews and all my high performing KPIs up to this point. None of which indicate any issues, behavioral or performance.

1k05osq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinanceAutomation/comments/1k05osq/the_auto_framework_your_shortcut_for_timewasting/,The AUTO Framework: Your Shortcut For Time-Wasting Tasks In Finance,"Alright, finance pros, let's talk automation‚Äîbut not the ""pie-in-the-sky, takes-a-year-to-set-up"" kind. I mean real efficiency gains, starting NOW. Meet The AUTO Score (Automate Out Time-Wasting Operations), your no-BS guide to figuring out which processes to automate so you can buy back your time and your sanity. Think of it as a cheat code for all those mind-numbing workflows.

Sound good? Let's break it down step-by-step.

Step 1: Score Your Processes üí°

Before you leap into automation, take a hard look at your workflows and rank them. Use a scale of 1 (hard pass) to 3 (prime automation material) for each category below:

How Many People Are Involved? (Fewer is Better)The less ""herding cats"" you need to do, the better. If it‚Äôs just you rocking the wheels, give it a 3. If you‚Äôre coordinating approvals like it‚Äôs a group project no one prepared for, that‚Äôs a 1.

How Repeatable is the Process? (More is Better)Spot a task that‚Äôs so repetitive it‚Äôs practically muscle memory? That‚Äôs the sweet spot for automation. Think tasks like month-end reconciliations or journal entries‚Äîthat's a 3. Sporadic or one-offs? They can wait. (Into the 1 bucket they go.)

How Often Does It Happen? (Frequent is Better)Daily or weekly tasks get priority here. More frequency = more ROI when you automate it. Throw the ""once-a-year"" randos into the low-scoring pile (politely, of course).

How Many Tools Does It Touch? (Fewer is Better)If you can automate it using your existing systems, bingo, it‚Äôs a 3. If it requires Frankenstein-ing new tools together? A solid 1 (and maybe a break before you spiral).

Step 2: Tally the Scores üìä

Add the numbers for each process, and voil√†‚Äîyou‚Äôve got your AUTO Scores. The higher the score, the juicier the automation potential. These are your Rockstar Processes, the ones begging to save you hours (or days).

Step 3: Automate the High-Scorers First üöÄ

Don‚Äôt overthink it. Start with your highest AUTO Score, automate like a boss, and enjoy the dopamine rush of eliminated busywork. Suddenly, ""manual reconciliation"" isn‚Äôt part of your vocabulary.

Step 4: Rinse and Repeat üîÑ

Automation isn‚Äôt a one-and-done deal. Reassess periodically! Processes shift, bottlenecks pop up, and new inefficiencies sneak in like uninvited guests. Keeping this framework in your back pocket ensures you're always ahead of the game.

Why Bother? üí≠

Because manual tasks are costing you more than time. They‚Äôre draining energy, limiting innovation, and trapping you in the weeds instead of letting you focus on strategy. Automate smart, and suddenly that extra coffee break or big-picture planning session feels possible.

Got an Automation Victory (or Horror Story)? Share Below! üôå

I want to hear about it all. What have you automated that genuinely changed the game for you? Or, what do you WISH you‚Äôd automated sooner? Sharing is caring, after all.

P.S. If your AUTO Score revealed some rockstars, what are you waiting for? Go crush it. üí•",1,1744758083.0,FinanceAutomation,0,1.0,False

1k05l4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spravato/comments/1k05l4o/advice_for_new_patients/,Advice for new patients,"I just finished my seventh treatment.  And today felt like my best one.  Here‚Äôs what I have learned.  

(For a little background, I am in Michigan and my clinician is through Lifestance.  If you need psychiatric care, I highly recommend.  They have literally saved my life.)

-I leave work on Tuesdays and Thursdays and change into sweats and a thermal.  Sometimes I bring a small blanket.  Before I leave, I take an anti nausea medication.  (Although I‚Äôve experienced no nausea during.). 

-Avoid all conflict / stressful situations before you go.  Arrive with a positive mindset and low expectations.  (I decided before I began that a 10% improvement would be success.) 

-Bring earbuds.  I HIGHLY recommend the Spravato playlist on Amazon music. 

-Worther original hard candies.  üíö. I love lifesavers.  They were god awful during Spravato.  

-Put your phone away!  And this is a struggle for me every time.  But it really makes a huge difference.  My advice, zip it in a coat pocket or bag. 

-Do not think of anything stressful / problems / conflicts‚Ä¶none of it.  Close your eyes and let your mind wander.  My doctor says, ‚Äúenjoy the ride.‚Äù  And my brain goes in really weird places.  But there‚Äôs been nothing scary.  

-During my first session, I could not fathom how this was a medical treatment.  I kept thinking about how much time / effort went into the research to make it possible.  No idea why‚Ä¶.

-In my second, I thought about being born (?).  During my third I spent the time visualizing about how I was a minuscule particle in the universe.  Today, I was hyper focused on a beach I had visited in Hawaii.  It‚Äôs always so bizarre‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But I just let my brain do its thing.  

-I suffer from MAJOR anxiety and am prescribed Diazepam (Valium).  Today, I took a 1/3 of a 5mg tablet before going because my heart was racing.  (Probably unique to me‚Ä¶and yes, my clinician knows.  But it helped me have the best session.). 

-When I leave, I have a friend order Applebees French Onion soup and a small container of garlic mashed potatoes.  It‚Äôs a perfect dinner.  

-I also get a small caramel latte on the way home.  It helps me be functional and not have the exhaustive sleepiness.  But I‚Äôm also a diehard coffee drinker.  

-Do not eat a giant meal afterwards.  After session five, I went out and had a sandwich.  ü§Æ. I didn‚Äôt get sick‚Ä¶but way too heavy and I felt rough afterwards. 

-Once I‚Äôm home, the day is over.  I chill out on the couch and I make no major decisions, nor do I talk about anything confrontational.  It takes about 2-3 hrs before I‚Äôm finally back to normal.

I‚Äôm on FMLA for my treatments and I have told my employer that I am not permitted to deal with anything work related after my session.  I do not look at my work email.  And I do not answer any work related texts / team‚Äôs messages.  (Nor would they want me to ‚ò∫Ô∏è). 

All said, my depression has gotten substantially better.  It‚Äôs unreal, given that the list of drugs I have tried in the last 25 yrs is probably near 50!  None of them worked‚Ä¶and 99% of them made life worse. I can honestly say‚Ä¶I would not be here without this drug and the professionals at Lifestance 

Finally‚Ä¶and I really want to emphasize.  This is what works for me.  It doesn‚Äôt mean that it will work for you.  But, I also walked in fairly blind, except for the kind sentiments from my fellow depressives that shared their experiences.  Hence, I am merely sharing mine, in hopes that it will benefit somebody.
