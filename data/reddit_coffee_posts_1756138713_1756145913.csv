I've been pretty stressed with work recently and I just want to meet new people and go out and have fun. Not to say my current friends aren't great but I'm trying to just break from all my usual routines and also because not all of of them like going out and that's just the mental break I need right now lol. I'm open to anything really, I'm a big foodie, I've recently started hitting the gym after a hiatus, I enjoy being active - like going on hikes or walks but also like the more chill stuff too like just catching a movie or grabbing a coffee and just yapping. If the night life is more your scene that's cool too, we can hit some bars, walk downtown, go karaoke, you name it. 

Okay so about me- I'm 5'11 180lb, pretty average body type by my standards but trying to get back to where I used to be. My friends say I'm handome lol, so there's that. I'm latino, born and raised in the CV but moved out to the bay for work maybe like 5 or 6 years ago. Currently living in east bay. I work in a tech adjacent PM type role. I'm overall a pretty chill dude but I like being more on the outgoing side. I'm a Leo if that matters to anyone lol. 

I'm looking for someone who is looking for something similar. Just wants to go out and chill with no pressure or expectations and just be able to have a good freaken time. I want to laugh with you, sing with you, dance with you and just do whatever we want. The reason this is M4F is because I'm just tired of hanging out with dudes all the time. I miss my girl bf, we had the best times together and now I guess I've been trying to fill the void. Anyways let me know if you're interested. Even if it's just walking around valley fair ir Santana row window shopping seriously no pressure. Just want to hang out and yap and have fun.",1,1756145609.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1mzy4ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1mzy4ga/aita_for_cutting_off_someone_i_was_seeing_after/,AITA for cutting off someone I was seeing after he went cold post-sex?,"Hi, I‚Äôm C (30F). In my culture, there‚Äôs a very real, very loud timeline around marriage. My parents are involved. I‚Äôve been on a matrimony platform for a while. I‚Äôm not anti-love or anti-romance, but I‚Äôve always been sceptical you can find both online.

Then I matched with R (33M). From day one, it felt easy. He initiated most chats, was warm and consistent, and we fell into this rhythm of talking all day. We had overlap too: both are originally from City B, both have lived in City C at different times, now in different cities. We bonded over travel, music, & movies. He‚Äôs articulate, funny, a bit intellectual, & geopolitically aware (I care about that). He was open about past relationships; I was too. He did casually mention he gets bored easily and that his dating history had a lot of short chapters.



Because this is a matrimony platform, the implied intent is marriage. Not ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see where this goes‚Äù in a casual, app-y way. But we still started by getting to know each other. After about a month, I asked if we could meet. He didn‚Äôt hesitate, booked tickets to City C where I live (he also has friends and family here). He kept me posted about his packed schedule, which I appreciated.



He met me on his first day itself. I thought we‚Äôd wait for the weekend, but he said if we don‚Äôt meet now, he‚Äôll get pulled into plans. We talked for hours, it felt familiar & comfortable, like the online version of us just breathed. We left separately & kept texting the next two days; he updated me through his parties & dinners.



Then he asked if he could come over. He‚Äôd been out late the previous night and was hungover, which is why I appreciated the effort to still meet. We talked a lot and ended up sleeping together. It was awkward! Not awful, just not good. Afterwards, he said he had to leave because he had morning plans (which he had told me about earlier). I didn‚Äôt push, but when he left, I felt this emptiness. I wanted him to stay.



After that, the energy dipped. He started taking longer to reply. Mid-week, I asked if he wanted to hang out, but he said he was out drinking with friends. Four days later, he suggested we meet. I went straight after work & the night was genuinely great. Deeper conversation, lots of laughing, more sharing about families and friends. He came back to mine and stayed over. The sex was better. The morning felt nice & we made coffee too!



And then, again, the delayed replies. I told myself he‚Äôs busy, he‚Äôs social, he‚Äôs soaking in his time here. Two days later, he asked to meet. I‚Äôd been out all day with a friend, got pretty drunk, and said yes without thinking. I met him around 1 a.m. at my friend‚Äôs place (she was passed out). We talked a bit, smoked, and slept together. I was pretty drunk. I vaguely remember telling him I didn‚Äôt like it when he left the first time & asking him to stay that night. He said he had plans early but could stay a bit longer, which he did, another 30 minutes or so and left at 3:30 a.m. I don‚Äôt fully remember the conversation, but I worry I got pushy or overly expressive or candid.



Things never recovered from that night. His texts became extremely delayed. He was always with friends, always working, and even though he‚Äôd said we‚Äôd meet once more before he left, he never brought it up. When he finally flew back to his city, my stomach sank. We had avoided the ‚Äúwhat next?‚Äù talk during the visit, but now that the interest felt like it had fallen off a cliff, I needed clarity.



The day after he arrived, I asked if we could have ‚Äúthe talk.‚Äù He said he was meeting a friend & maybe tomorrow. I agreed. Our texting had basically died. The next day I spiralled‚Äîdid I do something wrong? Was it how I look? (He‚Äôs very attractive, I‚Äôm average, short, chubby, struggling with body issues‚Äîmy insecurities were loud.) Later, I messaged: ‚ÄúDo we even need a talk? I think we both know where this is headed.‚Äù He replied that we still needed to talk. Hours later, he texted: ‚ÄúBusy with work, haven‚Äôt forgotten.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply. A few hours after that, past midnight, he texted asking if I was awake. I had slept by then, anxiously waiting.



The next day, I didn‚Äôt text at all. He didn‚Äôt either. For context, we hadn‚Äôt gone a single day without talking in three months. The silence felt like a verdict. I removed his number and unfollowed him-yes, dramatic, but in that moment, it felt like self-protection.



Four days later, I caved and texted him that he made me feel like crap & he should have just called. He said I should‚Äôve replied instead of unfollowing, and asked twice if he could call that night. I said we were past that and not to bother. He hasn‚Äôt replied since.

Extra context: This is the first time in years I‚Äôve felt a genuine spark with someone. After a rough breakup two years ago, I honestly thought I was emotionally shut. R felt like a little opening. Also, because this is a matrimony context, the baseline assumption is you‚Äôre exploring marriage, not a casual situation. He didn‚Äôt tell his parents about me (I didn‚Äôt tell him about a big family detail either, I didn‚Äôt feel safe/settled enough to share it yet). We never actually discussed marriage specifics; I intentionally held back because I wanted to first see if we were compatible as people. But the way he faded after sex made me feel like the whole ‚Äúmatrimony seriousness‚Äù evaporated on his side. It started to look like a holiday fling wrapped in serious packaging.



So AITA for cutting him off and not taking his call? Did I overreact by unfollowing and going radio silent that night? Part of me feels I should have kept my cool and had the final conversation. Another part of me thinks his actions were the conversation: daily enthusiasm pre-meet, then a steady slide to cold & noncommittal post-sex. I genuinely feel a tiny betrayal, not because he owed me a proposal, but because after three months of closeness, I think I deserved straightforward honesty instead of fade-out.",2,1756145602.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1mzy4fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1mzy4fg/should_the_best_coffee_maker_for_home_be_the_mr/,Should the Best Coffee Maker for Home Be the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB,"The Mr. Coffee SK13-RB Coffee Maker has quickly become a staple in my kitchen, and after a few weeks of daily use, I've formed a well-rounded opinion on its performance and practicality. As someone who starts every morning with a strong cup (or three) of coffee, having a reliable coffee maker is essential. This one offers basic yet efficient functionality that I‚Äôve come to appreciate. Still, there are areas where it could have been even better.

**Design and Build Quality**

Upon unboxing, the simplicity of the design struck me. The coffee maker has a classic aesthetic, all-black with a compact and lightweight build. It doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, but it feels sturdy for what it costs. It fits nicely on my countertop, and I appreciate the manageable size, especially since my kitchen is somewhat cramped. The glass carafe is well-crafted and easy to handle, though I found the lid to be a bit finicky when I first used it. The overall build is nothing extraordinary, but it clearly prioritizes functionality over flair.

**Ease of Use**

Using this coffee maker couldn‚Äôt be more straightforward. Its on/off indicator light is a subtle yet convenient feature to confirm it‚Äôs working. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause function has honestly saved my morning more times than I can count. Being impatient, I always grab a cup before the brewing finishes, and this feature ensures minimal mess during those moments. The removable basket filter is another highlight‚Äîit‚Äôs effortless to fill, and cleanup after brewing is as simple as a rinse. I did notice, however, that re-inserting the filter basket isn‚Äôt always smooth, especially when I‚Äôm half-awake.

**Brewing Performance**

The coffee machine truly shines here if you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes evenly brewed, rich-tasting coffee. It handles small batches and full carafes equally well, though I personally noticed the flavor is slightly better with larger quantities. I love that it can manage up to 12 cups, which is ideal when I have guests over or need an extra caffeine boost during busy workdays. That said, the brewing process isn‚Äôt the fastest‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt the one to grab if you‚Äôre always in a last-minute rush. But what it lacks in speed, it makes up for in aroma and depth of flavor.

**Good Points**

‚Ä¢ Compact design ideal for smaller counters  
‚Ä¢ Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause prevents annoying spills when mid-brew  
‚Ä¢ Removable filter basket simplifies cleaning and refills  

**Areas of Concern**

‚Ä¢ Filter basket alignment could be improved  
‚Ä¢ Slightly slow for those in a morning rush  
‚Ä¢ Lid on the carafe can feel delicate  

**Other Options**

Comparing the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB to other coffee makers in the same category, I‚Äôd say its simplicity helps it stand out in some ways. For example, the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker adds programmable brewing but lacks the quick and easy usability of this model. Cuisinart‚Äôs brewers often feel a bit over-engineered for a casual coffee drinker‚ÄîI‚Äôve tested some and ended up overwhelmed by too many options I never used. While those brands may have fancier features, they tend to be priced higher and have steeper learning curves for basic operation. This machine strikes the perfect balance if you want something no-nonsense.

**Affordable Quality**

Where this coffee maker truly shines is its overall value. It‚Äôs budget-friendly without skimping on essential features. The money you save here can go toward premium coffee beans or other additions to your brewing ritual. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt boast advanced features like programmability or fancy touch control panels, but for those strict on budget and choose practicality, it‚Äôs a solid choice. It‚Äôs rare to find something at this price point that consistently delivers decent coffee day after day.

¬† K atie Marcelli knew that with the right staff, she could organize the world. But as good help was hard to find, she contented herself with smaller projects, such as organizing closets, parties, and seminars. She owned her own business, made a decent living, and had a five-year business plan that would make a Fortune 500 CEO weep with envy. She was tough, confident, in charge.  
  
¬† On the outside.  
  
¬† On the inside her nerves were currently playing baseball in her stomach, and someone had just hit a foul ball down the third base line. She pressed a hand to her midsection and knew that fourth cup of coffee she‚Äôd gulped in her car was about to turn to acid. She was tense, wired, and pacing in high heels that might make her ankles look as slender as a gazelle‚Äôs but also threatened her future ability to walk without a limp.  
  
¬† Oh, please, oh, please let me say just the right thing, she thought as she paused in front of a large window overlooking Century City and Beverly Hills. Opportunities like this didn‚Äôt come along every day. She‚Äôd wanted to take her company to the next level, and this job was going to make it happen. All she had to do was be‚Ä¶sparkling.  
  
¬† The word made her smile. Ah, yes. She was ‚Äúthe Sparkling One. ‚Äù Bright, bubbly, like fine champagne that had‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMs. Marcelli? Mr. Stryker will see you now. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Katie turned toward a well-dressed fifty-something woman who held open a thick door and motioned for her to enter.  
  
¬† Katie stepped from the nicely carpeted hallway into sink-to-your-ankles plushness in an office the size of Rhode Island. A corner office, with floor-to-ceiling windows, sleek yet traditional furniture, a massive pair of leather sofas on the walls opposite the windows, and an elegantly dressed man good-looking enough to grace one of the billboards that lined Sunset Boulevard.  
  
¬† Zach Stryker, one of only three senior partners in the largest family law firm in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and the youngest partner. He had a reputation for being tough, unflinching, and a hell of a negotiator. Oh, and he wasn‚Äôt just a winner in the courtroom. Rumor had it he broke at least two female hearts a week.  
  
¬† The nerves in her stomach instantly abandoned their baseball game and began flying in a ‚Äúman-alert‚Äù formation which warned her that caffeine overload was not all that far away. Perfect, she thought, because staying calm in a meeting was so overrated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMs. Marcelli?‚Äù the man said, his voice low and sultry enough to make him a fortune in radio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Zach Stryker. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Stryker. A pleasure. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She managed to cross the carpet without twisting her ankle. As he came around his pool-size desk, she transferred her briefcase from her right hand to her left, then shook with him.  
  
¬† Oh, great, sparks, she thought as sexual heat arced from her fingers to her chest and beyond. Wildly attractive, tall, dark, and blue-eyed. How L. A. How her luck. Wasn‚Äôt she only supposed to care about the job?  
  
¬† A good question, she thought as she took the seat he offered in front of his desk.  
  
¬† Instead of circling back to his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the man‚Äù leather chair, he settled next to her, then angled toward her and gave her the kind of engaging smile that could send an angry, gray-haired nun into cardiac arrest. Katie told herself she was made of sterner stuff.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre going to throw a party together,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† Right. A party. The reason she was here. ‚ÄúAbsolutely. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She opened her briefcase and pulled out a light blue folder. ‚ÄúYour assistant filled me in on the basics. Your law firm hosts an annual fund-raiser, with the proceeds going to several local family charities. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight. The event is generally coordinated by one of the partner‚Äôs wives. John‚Äôs wife volunteered, but then she discovered she was pregnant with twins. Her doctor didn‚Äôt want her stressing herself with all the planning, so I stepped in and said I‚Äôd take care of things. ‚Äù He rested one ankle on his opposite knee. ‚ÄúNot having a wife, I needed to call in a professional. That‚Äôs where you come in. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI see. ‚Äù Which she did. Sort of. Yes, she‚Äôd planned parties before  
, but never one of this magnitude. It was black-tie, A-list, and exclusive. She would never personally have been invited, although she‚Äôd read about the fun and good times in In Style magazine.  
  
¬† No doubt he couldn‚Äôt ask one of his women to do it. That would require him keeping her around for more than fifteen minutes. A circumstance that would no doubt cramp his style.  
  
¬† He pushed a stack of folders toward her. ‚ÄúEverything you need to know about the previous two parties, including the guest list. John‚Äôs wife got as far as picking the hotel, so you‚Äôre going to be starting from there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Which meant practically starting from scratch. Easy enough. If she had six months and hired three or four more staff members, she could‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe party‚Äôs in May. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot a problem,‚Äù she said, holding in a shriek. May? As in less than four months from now? As in ohmygod, now what?  
  
¬† He gave her the exact date, and she wrote it down on her pad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a lot to ask,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs you said, Mr. Stryker, I‚Äôm a professional. This is what I do. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you do it very well. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The intensity of his gaze unnerved her. Or maybe it was the heat he generated. She felt as if she were sitting too close to a furnace. Or maybe it was the drop in his voice, as if they were having an intimate conversation.  
  
¬† She glanced around at the impressive office, then studied his tailor-made suit, expensive shoes, and casually elegant good looks. Uh-huh. She knew the type. Zach Stryker was the kind of man used to getting what he wanted in business, and in life. Women lined up by the dozens just to throw themselves at his feet.  
  
¬† She might be experiencing a little attraction, but there was no way she would become one of a crowd. So she would keep her thoughts and her reactions to herself. Besides, this was business.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the kind of woman who enjoys a challenge, this is going to be exactly what you were looking for,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI do like a challenge,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid to take risks or work hard. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm successful. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it is. ‚Äù He shrugged, and gave her another dazzling smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a typical guy about party planning, so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to be much help to you. Still, I‚Äôll do what I can. ‚Äù He shifted so that both feet were flat on the floor, then leaned toward her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to work closely together. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She had the feeling they were talking about more than the party, but she wasn‚Äôt going to let on.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but the bottom line is, Mr. Stryker, you‚Äôre hiring me to make the party happen with a minimum of disruption to your already busy schedule. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall me Zach. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Call me anytime.  
  
¬† Fortunately she only thought the words, rather than saying them aloud. When she got home she was going to give her hormones a stern talking to. Over the years they‚Äôd quivered over any number of inappropriate men, but never one this far out of her league. Men like Zach chewed up and spit out women like her with their morning coffee.  
  
¬† She mentally winced at the awkward metaphor, then turned her attention back to business.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look over the plans from the previous fund-raisers,‚Äù she said as she gathered the files. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll review the location and come up with three or four possible themes. I should be back in touch with you by the middle of next week. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat sounds good. I‚Äôve notified my assistant to get you in to see me as quickly as possible. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Talk about an invitation. ‚ÄúGreat. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Katie snapped her briefcase closed and they both rose. Which meant they were standing close together. Too close.  
  
¬† Despite her potentially crippling high heels, she found herself several inches shorter than Zach. He smelled good‚Äîclean, sexy, powerful. His cobalt blue eyes crinkled slightly at the corners. She couldn‚Äôt decide if they were his best feature or if she liked his mouth better.  
  
¬† The job, she reminded herself. His ability to pay her was by far his most appealing characteristic.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis event is very important to my law firm, Katie,‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a win. Hardly a news flash. He wasn‚Äôt the kind of man who looked for anything else. Still, she could reassure him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in second place, either. You‚Äôll have your win. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He smiled. She felt her insides shift slightly. The sensation was nearly as disconcerting as the heat washing over her. If the man ever got tired of the law, he could make a fortune simply smiling at women.  
  
¬† She doubted any of his attentions were even personally directed at her. No doubt he knew he was God‚Äôs gift to women and couldn‚Äôt help sharing the bounty. She was smart enough not to take any of it personally.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you for your time,‚Äù he said as he led the way to the door.  
  
¬† Katie followed, then paused when he opened it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt done any work for your firm before,‚Äù she said, because in addition to being efficient, she was wildly curious. The combination occasionally got her in trouble. ‚ÄúHow did you find my company?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA recommendation. ‚Äù He held up his hand before she could speak. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember from whom. I have it somewhere. I‚Äôll get back to you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd appreciate that. Most of my business comes through referrals. I‚Äôd like to pass on a thank-you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure. ‚Äù He took a step back, then paused. ‚ÄúMake sure Dora has your number. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course. Good-bye. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She nodded once and headed down the long corridor toward the bank of elevators by the reception desk. Dora must be his assistant. As she‚Äôd already given the woman her card, she knew Zach had her number. If he needed it. Not that he would. There was nothing more to say until she‚Äôd gotten up to speed on the fund-raiser.  
  
¬† Unless he wanted to call for some other reason. Seduction? The thought made her chuckle. Right. So likely to happen.  
  
¬† As the elevator doors opened, she stepped inside and pressed the button for the parking garage.  
  
¬† What very few people knew and what she took great pains to disguise was that under her expensive business suit beat the heart of a romantic. Men like Zach Stryker would never appreciate that. They wanted the new, the trendy, the easy. She had been told more than once she was anything but easy.  
  
¬† If he wanted a conquest, she wasn‚Äôt his woman. She wanted hearts, flowers, and happily ever after. He wanted a cheap, sexual encounter.  
  
¬† As she walked out of the elevator, her hormones took great pains to remind her that it had been some time since the last emotionally significant relationship in her life and that a cheap, sexual encounter would go a long way toward smoothing some of her frazzled edges.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot my style,‚Äù Katie said aloud and unlocked her car door.  
  
¬† Oh, but if it were, Zach Stryker would certainly be her man.  
  
¬† Katie drove out of the underground parking lot and headed west. While mid-February could be cool and rainy in Los Angeles, the past week had been perfect. California blue skies, balmy temperatures‚Äîno smog, no haze, and not an earthquake in sight. It was the kind of weather that drew tourists like flies to a pest strip, especially those suffering with snow and blizzards in their regular lives.  
  
¬† After crossing under the 405 freeway, Katie turned left, toward Santa Monica and her dollhouse-size bungalow. Traffic was lighter than it would be in an hour or so, as lawyers, accountants and financial types packed it in for the weekend.  
  
¬† Okay, yes, it was only two in the afternoon, and she really should still be working. But hey. She‚Äôd just landed a huge contract, been smiled at by one of the best-looking men in LaLa Land, and somewhere north of the city there was a cannoli with her name on it.  
  
¬† Inspired by the thought of dinner, she threaded her way through the growing congestion and made it home in about twenty minutes. After changing from her suit and high heels into a sleeveless dress and sandals, she grabbed a cardigan, the already-packed overnight bag, and headed for the bathroom. There she plucked pins from her hair until the shoulder-blade‚Äìlength reddish-brown waves tumbled free. A scrunchy secured them at the nape of her neck. She paused long enough to slather sunscreen on every exposed inch. She might be half Italian, but she‚Äôd inherited her mother‚Äôs Irish skin. Just thinking about the sun was enough to start her burning.  
  
¬† On her way to the front door Katie glanced at her answering machine. No flashing light announced the delight of a waiting message. Obviously Zach Stryker had manfully resisted the nearly overwhelming urge to call her and beg her to return to his office where they would make love on his designer leather sofa.  
  
¬† Once in the driveway she stowed her luggage in the trunk, then slipped into her Sebring. The convertible top opened, then folded neatly behind the backseat. An adjustment of her radio from NPR to a rock station completed her travel ritual. It was time to go home.  
  
¬† By three o‚Äôclock she‚Äôd crested the hill that marked the line between L. A. and the valley. The exit to the 101 freeway was on her right. Katie slipped into that lane, all the while singing along with a song about broken hearts and holding on.  
  
¬† Her car phone rang.  
  
¬† Katie hit a button on the console, muting her radio and activating her hands-free microphone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said, speaking loudly to be heard over the wind and the sound of the other cars.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, good. You‚Äôre in your car,‚Äù her youngest sister, Mia, said, sounding delighted. ‚ÄúI was calling to make sure you‚Äôre still coming home this weekend. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already on my way. How‚Äôs school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm settling into my classes and getting ready for midterms. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Katie frowned as she followed the curving interchange. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just start the quarter?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mia sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúTell me about it. I love UCLA, but the quarter system is so tough. I barely figure out what the class is about and suddenly it‚Äôs time for midterms. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd despite the pressure, you dazzle us all with your straight A‚Äôs. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI try. ‚Äù Mia giggled. ‚ÄúGuess what? There‚Äôs gonna be an announcement at dinner. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnnouncement?‚Äù Katie eased into the fast lane and concentrated on the minivan in front of her. ‚ÄúGood or bad?‚Äù  
  
¬† The Marcelli family had a tradition of announcing news at large family gatherings. Once everyone was seated and the meal had been served, the pronouncements began. Confirmations of births, blights, and illness were made, along with surprises, some welcome, some not.  
  
¬† Katie quickly considered the possibility of damage to the vines, but it was only February. Everything was dormant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Mia said with another giggle. ‚ÄúVery good. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant to give me a hint?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot really. So how was your Valentine‚Äôs Day?‚Äù  
  
¬† Katie remembered the quiet evening she‚Äôd spent in front of her tiny fireplace. She‚Äôd celebrated one of her favorite days with a bottle of champagne, Godiva chocolates, and a romance novel.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was perfect,‚Äù she said honestly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWas there a man involved?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope. I‚Äôm currently blissfully single. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Mia sighed. ‚ÄúKatie, you know that means trouble. If you‚Äôre not seeing anyone, the entire family is going to jump all over you this weekend. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The Marcelli family might be incredibly close and loving, but they were also rabid about marriage and kids. At twenty-eight and still single, Katie wasn‚Äôt just considered an old maid, she was thought to be unnatural and in need of serious therapy.  
  
¬† Which she didn‚Äôt want to think about. ‚ÄúSo how was your Valentine‚Äôs Day?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFabulous. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Katie pictured her sister‚Äôs petite yet curvy figure, her streaked blond hair and doe eyes. She grinned. ‚ÄúLet me guess. Forty-seven guys wrestled for the honor of buying you dinner. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. I just saw David. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been seeing him for a while now, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù She vaguely recalled a good-looking kid breezing through at Christmas.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-huh. Since Septembe  
r. He‚Äôs really special, Katie. We‚Äôre in love. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for you,‚Äù Katie said, speaking the truth. She was two parts thrilled and one part envious. When was the last time she‚Äôd been in love? Not her previous boyfriend, or the one before that. They‚Äôd been great guys, but not the one.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI should let you concentrate on driving,‚Äù Mia said. ‚ÄúSee you in a couple of hours. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there. Give my love to everyone. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will. Bye. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The connection clicked off. Katie pushed the button to restore her radio, but instead of joining in with the song, she shook her head. Mia in love? Was her baby sister really old enough to fall for a guy?  
  
¬† She laughed. Mia was eighteen. In the Marcelli family that was the perfect age for a short engagement, followed by a long marriage. Katie‚Äôs other sisters, Francesca and Brenna, had both married at eighteen, although Francesca was now a young, beautiful widow. Katie herself had been engaged at eighteen, although the marriage had never taken place.  
  
¬† Whispers of the past threatened, but she wasn‚Äôt interested in spoiling her drive, so she ignored them. Instead she cranked up the volume on the radio and fantasized about a certain lawyer she‚Äôd recently met. He might be fifteen kinds of bad for her, but he sure knew how to make her body burst into flames.  
  
¬† A wrought-iron arch announced the entrance to the Marcelli Winery. Hundreds of acres of vineyard stretched out on both sides of the two-lane drive amusingly named Pleasure Road. Come summer, the plants would be thick with leaves and budding fruit. In September, right before harvest, they would hang low with heavy, ripe grapes, but now, in February, they were simply gray and bare.  
  
¬† As Katie drove under the arch, she noticed that the winter pansies flourished. The dozen or so flower-filled half barrels surrounding the base of the arch were filled with colorful blossoms waving in the soft breeze. She could inhale the scent of flowers and earth, and the ocean in the distance.  
  
¬† The road to the main hacienda was nearly three quarters of a mile. Up ahead the three-story, pale yellow hacienda stood at the end of a long driveway. Wrought-iron balconies decorated the front of the structure. Katie didn‚Äôt have all that much interest in growing grapes or making wine, but she considered herself a real fan of the Marcelli family home. So many happy memories lingered in the corners and crevices of the old place. So much history filled each of the rooms. Coming back always made her feel good.  
  
¬† She pulled up next to the large house, parking her car next to Mia‚Äôs five-year-old Accord. A beat-up pickup sat on the other side, which meant Francesca had also come home for the weekend. Brenna would be arriving later. Katie smiled in anticipation. The four sisters hadn‚Äôt been under the same roof since Christmas, nearly two months before.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd barely popped the trunk when a side door opened and Francesca strolled out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd be the next to arrive,‚Äù she said with a wave. ‚ÄúBrenna won‚Äôt be here for a while. She had to take Jeff to the airport. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not coming for the weekend?‚Äù Katie asked, more than a little disappointed. She, along with her sisters, adored Brenna‚Äôs husband. He was funny, affectionate, the brother they‚Äôd never had.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope. He had to go to some doctor convention. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd rather go there than hang out with us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI agree. I mean, we‚Äôre charming and we have unlimited access to pasta. What‚Äôs not to like?‚Äù  
  
¬† The two women laughed, then embraced. Katie hugged her sister hard, holding her close for a second. When they released each other, she tried not to notice how great Francesca looked in her white cropped T-shirt and pale blue skirt.  
  
¬† Francesca had always been the pretty sister‚Ä¶pretty and nearly physically perfect. She was perfectly tall (5 feet 9), perfectly slender, with that annoying combination of large breasts and nonexistent hips. Her perfect features‚Äîwide hazel eyes, a full mouth, and cheekbones that defied gravity‚Äîcombined to create a face that could not only launch a thousand ships, it could heal several debilitating personality flaws. Long, thick brown hair tumbled down her back, while perfect, olive-colored skin seemed to radiate light.

I use them when I run, the type that use varied prompts with spaced repetition. I get huge benefit out of speaking out loud with enough vailried repetitions to stick and get the rule not just a phrase. Better yet if they explain grammar as well.

I've tried or completed all of the normal recommendations from here-- Paul Noble, Pimsleur, Language Transfer, Coffee Break, Michael Thomas. Pimsleur really helped me but now I'm through it.

But I also stumbled across one called Stress Free German that I quite like, so I'm looking for recommendations of other smaller podcasts that prompt with branch and constructions and spaced repetition. I am not looking for listening-only/mostly because while I do try to do that as well, don't have good concentration for it and it doesn't stick as well.

So does anybody know of less well-known ""interactive"" podcasts or audio courses? I guess I could also use YouTube videos so long as they don't need me to look at the screen. Targeting A2/B1 would be ideal.

1mzxyak,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1mzxyak/should_you_trust_simplehuman_compost_bags_for/,Should You Trust simplehuman Compost Bags for Food Waste Use,"The simplehuman CW0525 compostable trash bags were a recent addition to my household, and they quickly became a staple for my composting routine. As someone who genuinely tries to minimize waste and live sustainably, I was excited to see how well these claim-to-fit liners would perform. Out of the box, the packaging instantly had a premium feel. The bags seemed sturdy despite their compostable nature, which was my initial concern with eco-friendly products. Compost bags, in my experience, often rip or leak, but I was optimistic about these. I tested them in different scenarios over several weeks, and here's my detailed take.

**A Thoughtful Design with Practicality in Mind**  
One of the first things I noticed was how perfectly these liners fit the matching compost caddy. The custom-fit design ensures that the bag doesn‚Äôt slip or bunch up inside the bin, which has always been a problem with generic options. I‚Äôve tried numerous trash bags over the years, and ""perfect fit"" isn‚Äôt always as advertised. However, these bags genuinely stay in place and remain invisible when the lid is closed. This clean look is especially appreciated since my kitchen compost caddy sits out in the open. In addition, the green color is subtle, almost calming, and blends effortlessly with the overall kitchen aesthetic.

**Performance and Durability**  
I‚Äôll admit, I was skeptical about how durable a compostable bag could be. In my head, I envisioned soggy food scraps seeping through or the bag falling apart mid-use. To my surprise, these trash bags held up incredibly well. The simplehuman CW0525 handles everything from coffee grounds to leftover pasta without any signs of weakness. An average liner comfortably lasts for around three to four days of composting unless overfilled, which beats the flimsy feel of other eco-friendly brands I‚Äôve tested.

[Check simplehuman CW0525 price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b09msmkpsc/)  

**Strong Points**  
‚Ä¢ Certified compostable for both backyard and commercial use.  
‚Ä¢ Tailored design eliminates slippage and ensures a neat fit.  
‚Ä¢ A convenient 30-count pack, perfect for regular users.  
‚Ä¢ Unscented material, so there‚Äôs no strange artificial smell competing with the scraps.  

**Flaws That Need Attention**  
To be fair, every product has room for improvement, and these liners aren‚Äôt an exception.  
‚Ä¢ They decompose fully over time, but they start to weaken if left sitting with moist garbage for too long.  
‚Ä¢ The thin material, though sturdy, means it‚Äôs better not to overload them with overly wet or extremely sharp items.  
‚Ä¢ Slightly pricier compared to generic store-bought bags, but the quality and eco-friendly factor balance the price point.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing these compost bags to others on the market, I noticed a drastic difference in user experience. Competitors, like the BioBag, tend to have an unpredictable fit unless you marry them with the right bin. Moreover, some brands prioritize compostability but sacrifice strength, which frequently leads to messy spills in the kitchen. In contrast, the simplehuman CW0525 excels in blending function with sustainability. That said, while something like Glad‚Äôs compost bags offers more generous durability, they don‚Äôt come with a custom-fit feature that sets the simplehuman version apart.

**Value for Money**  
Let‚Äôs talk cost efficiency ‚Äì are these worth the slightly higher tag? As far as I‚Äôm concerned, yes. Given their eco-conscious nature and thoughtful engineering, you‚Äôre paying for quality and peace of mind. Plus, the fact you can pair them with auto-delivery through the simplehuman app makes these even more compelling for someone who values convenience. While not the cheapest option, they prove cost-effective when you consider how much convenience and reliability they bring into your composting setup.

1mzxy7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/1mzxy7s/brooks_range_backpacking_12_days/,Brooks Range Backpacking (12 Days),"TLDR Version/Intro:

¬†Me and 4 buddies went to the Brooks Range in Alaska for 12 days of hiking through one of the largest wilderness areas in North America. We had a blast and it went great. We got flown in by a bush flight, walked along many river valleys, hiked up a talus pile peak and¬†then through the wilderness, across rivers and over hills to the Dalton Highway where we got picked up by a commercial shuttle service that drove us back to Fairbanks and the World.

¬†Long version:

¬†Day 0:

Drive from Bellingham to Seattle, Fly from Seattle to Fairbanks on Alaska Air (duh), van ride, Uber ride. Walk around town, hit a bar, Thai food. Beers in the hotel room.

¬†

Day 1:

Fly to Coldfoot on Wright Air, slight delay due to missed flight (don‚Äôt believe the hotel that you don‚Äôt need to be early to Wright Air, they take their business very seriously). Immediately upon landing in Coldfoot we jumped into prop plane the same age as my parents and fly with Dirk of Coyote Air into Upper Marsh Fork landing strip on the Marsh Fork of the Canning River. The flight was incredible, frequently with wheels just clearing ridgetops and flying the terrain up and down valleys. Extremely scenic, caribou and sheep. Upon landing there was much exclaiming and pointing and backslapping. Once we got settled down and the final packing completed we hiked up valley. Warm, patchy sun, overnight hard rain. Glorious, glorious, glorious!

I got a good chuckle out of everyone later admitting that they were forcing down the nausea the whole bush flight and hiding it from the others.

5.5 miles, 2.5 hours.

‚ÄúRainy Camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 2:

Hike up Marsh Fork, cross into unnamed very upper East Fork tributary of the Ivishak River drainage. Camp at headwaters. Hard day, with technical talus and side-hilling above cliffs and raging water. The river was running pretty high from the previous night's rain so walking in the canyon bottom was not an option for us, otherwise this would have been easier. Cool and misty with rain. Amazing, just like home but nothing like it at all at the same time, so great all around; we expected weather, didn‚Äôt rain enough to get wet. Much exclaiming about the scenery.

12 miles, 9 hours

‚ÄúFrosty camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 3:

Awoke to frost on the tents and plants. Hiked down canyon to junction with upper east fork of the Ivishak, down river past multiple small confluences, easy walking. Over interminable ridge with tussocks (our first!) to Ivishak River main stem. Camp in a ‚Äúhay field‚Äù. Bluebird sun and warm, 2 long great breaks for lunch. Much exclaiming about the scenery. We pushed hard on this day to set ourselves up for a potential summit tomorrow assuming the weather held out. We didn't want to get stranded up high looking for a campsite with no water.

16 miles, 11 hours

‚ÄúHayfield camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 4:

Ascended Ivishak valley toward Continental Divide, turn south to climb Seefar Peak via dogleg east gully, awesome snow in first gully, then major talus slog to the summit. Amazing time spent on the summit, warm but breezy. Lots of cool fossils in the limestone. Descent to the south and west terrible talus, so we bailed off the ridge early to Wind River valley. Made camp. Amazing dry tundra camp next to river. Shoes and socks dry at camp! First time since 5 minutes into the trip. Bathed in river and washed clothes. Bluebird, sun, warm. Much exclaiming about the scenery. A good time was had by all.

10 miles 4000', 10 hours

‚ÄúSwimming Hole Camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 5:

Hiked down Wind River, saw wolves with puppies, then later moose which led us into a lousy tussock field, camped in side creek. Very mediocre spot, but extremely close to water and some dry wood, so we had a fire and drank margaritas to enliven the spirits a little. It worked. Much exclaiming about the scenery.

14.3 miles, 7.5 hours

‚ÄúMargaritaville Camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 6:

Up wind River tributary, saw a grizzly with two cubs, a heard of sheep way up high, and a lone wolf across the valley making quick work of the talus. Up a unique talus-ey canyon, over two passes, one being the Continental Divide, down a tributary of a southern fork of the Ribbon River. Great walking most of the time. We got showered on twice, but mostly sunny. The area where we looked to camp was somewhat brushy with knee-high vegetation and it took a bit of looking to find a good campsite, eventually made a spot work quite well with great moss and blueberries.

13 miles, 8 hours

‚ÄúBarefoot camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 7:

Nice enough weather early, quickly turned to rain, then hard rain, despite the Inreach weather saying it would improve throughout the day. Misery. Trudged up to beautiful lake, too windy and cold to enjoy it. Saw wolf puppies briefly. Over pass separating the Ribbon and Accomplishment Creek and down to tundra on other side, just past dangerously slick boulder field. Dove into tents soaked through. Very cold and wet. Lunch in tent, nap. Whiskey helped spirits a lot... at least in my tent. Less exclaiming about the scenery today, though everyone admitted it would have been great if we could have enjoyed it.

8 miles, 4 hours, no breaks.

‚ÄúSunny dry happy fun camp‚Äù

¬†

Day 8:

Woke to fog but no rain, weather improved dramatically throughout the morning. This was clutch since our base layers were completely soaked. First thing in the morning everybody got ready to hike then leapt into our wet clothes and immediately started walking quickly to warm up in an attempt to dry out some clothes. Down Accomplishment Creek, up side creek over a pass with lots of caribou antlers, half way down canyon on other side to camp. Beautiful country, lots of exclaiming over the scenery, sunny and warm, dried out everything. Decent walking. Saw moose, wolverine. Drizzle just before camp.

‚ÄúSewing camp‚Äù due to a near catastrophic pack blowout.

9.5 hours. 16 miles

¬†

Day 9:

Drizzle, fog, cool. Down interesting puzzle canyon, that was tons of fun to figure out, left side, right side, in the creek, does it go? It goes! Saw a griz at a distance, then across a big river, nameless east tributary of the Sagavanirktok, (tough, fast crossing), hardest of the trip. Slogged up a tussock hill, to canyon, over pass and down to Sag valley, mediocre camp, not many options. We were told that the Sag was a tough crossing that kills people from time to time, so we were excited to get a look at it from up high. I had done a lot of satellite and map reconnaissance of the entire route and had picked out an area of the Sag that is quite braided, hopefully making for the easiest crossing. I had read a few scattered reports of people who crossed just a couple miles further north and had to use rafts.

‚ÄúLumpy camp‚Äù

12 miles, 7.5 hours

¬†

Day 10:

Foggy AM, then sunny and warm. Across the Sag! It ended up being not that big a deal, but it helped that we were on day 10 and river crossing 1 million +/- a couple hundred thousand. Up the valley wall to an amazing broad sunny saddle with rolling fog, for a tea break. We were on a plateau above the confluence of the Atigun and Sagavanirktok Rivers. The fog started to break up after break, we walked slowly; some bad weather was predicted today and the next couple so over the previous few days we had hustled to make sure we could get across the Sag before the rain set in. Unlike the previous days, the weather report ended up being pessimistic and we had great afternoon sunshine. We strolled through tussocks to camp on a sunny alpine tundra slope. Amazing day. Surprise sun! Everyone tard sailed all their gear out on the tundra to dry out everything. Dry socks even!! The low tundra around camp made for great lounging and camping, and beautiful. The sun and sense of accomplishment really made the light on the hills glow that long afternoon.

‚ÄúKick Ass Camp‚Äù

5 miles, 5 hours

¬†

Day 11:

Hiked off the plateau to the Atigun River, up the river valley to the road, road!? Long road walk to Galbraith Lake camp. My knees hurt after the 8 miles of road for the first time in the entire trip. Mostly cloudy with sun patches and a short drizzle. Surprising amount of traffic on the road, saw a civic! Fire and celebratory attitude at camp.

‚ÄúGalbraith Lake Campground‚Äù

6 hours 15 miles

¬†

Day 12:

Woke up leisurely, lounged around, day hike to West Galbraith Peak, tea and coffee on the summit. Camp time, eating everything that was left. Mostly cloudy, mild.

‚ÄúGalbraith Lake Campground‚Äù

5 mi, 4.5 hours

¬†

Day 13:

Lounged in the tent, rain and drizzle, picked up by van at 11. Wes from Dalton Highway Express picked us up in a beater 15 passenger van.

¬†Two entrees and a beer at the truck stop in Coldfoot. Food at the farthest north truck stop and bar in America was cheaper than in Bellingham.

‚ÄúHotel Camp‚Äù

10 hours in the van, zero walking.

¬†Over the whole trip we left nothing behind except a part of ourselves; and took nothing with us except memories, a sense of accomplishment, and full souls.

She said that she may have thrown it away while she was cleaning her car. She does have a Real ID and US Passport. I am not sure if she remember her Alien #. 

I told her that it will cost her to have someone file for her and told her just buy me a coffee and I‚Äôll help her. Back in the days, I did all my filing myself (I-130, I-485, naturalization, EAD) and thankfully all went well. So this time should be a walk in the park especially if all information is available. 
Questions:

1. How much ballpark does it cost for a paralegal/immigration attorney‚Äôs office will it cost her besides the application fee vs her buying me a coffee. I mean I will do it free for her no biggie.

1mzxxwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mzxxwr/i_need_honest_opinions/,I need honest opinions,"Hi, 

I am in a local female church group. I had a friend for a little while, since around the beginning of this year, I took her in after hearing about problems she had in her personal life. We are the same age, and I kinda felt for her, we related on a ton of topics, but I had to confront her about an issue. This girl with disabilities recently joined our group a few months ago. Her first time there, she told us, it was very difficult for her to make friends, and she prayed that she would find more support on that topic. I instantly wanted to be close to her; she is sweet, kind, and understanding. I come from a family where disabilities are prevalent, but not the same as hers. She is very easy to talk to and set boundaries with. She and I talk at least once a week or hang out. However, the other girl (whom I will refer to as Ella, not her real name) would occasionally make odd comments about her. Ella would say that she should not have to put another person's needs in front of hers and felt uncomfortable around her. I will say, the girl with disabilities did text us a ton in the beginning and would even call. I could see where that's frustrating, but it gets worse. Ella would make plans with her and cancel them. It only happened 2 times on official plans and 3 more with unofficial ones. After the second time, I texted her and simply asked if she could be more conscious when making plans and cancelling, and if she's not reliable, not to make them to begin with. She absolutely blew up at me and said I needed to be more considerate of her and what she may be going through (mind you, the girl with disabilities has a father who is currently facing terminal cancer treatment). I did ask Ella why she canceled, she told me ""going thru stuff"" I asked if she could expand and she said ""why do I have to"". I told her that she was not the only one going through things, and to be more thoughtful of that. She started cussing me out and even said that she did not want to ""babysit"" another person's kid. All I said in response was, this is an odd way to reply to this kind of situation, I did not accuse her of lying about the reason for her canceling plans, just that she needed to make sure she could follow through because of how it can affect our friend. Then, boom, I get blocked. I texted her later on iMessage and told her that I did not mean to put anyone first and that I am sorry if the tone was off, but I stand firm in what I said. I told her that we are cool at church and we would have zero problems, but from this point on, it is best if we don't interact. I knew instantly this girl was going to go to a church leader and play up the victim card. There's a whole separate reason why I knew she would. I see her using a victim card a lot. 

I talked to the girl with disabilities and her mom. Mostly, I talked to her mom because she voiced some concern to me (not in ill intent, whole other deal that's hard to explain, but it was very casual). I then found Ella had questioned the friend as to why I was texting her about it, then she said, ""if you are going to act like this and if I am going to be harassed, I no longer feel comfortable hanging out."" WHICH BTW SHE CAN ASK ME WHY I AM TEXTING HER NOT THE GIRL WITH DISABILITIES???? HELLO? Then to say ""this harassment"", she nor her mother asked me to text her...it was my own decision. She just jumped to that conclusion. Not once did she apologize for canceling, ask me about why I would have texted or anything. Ella has the mothers number and could have even confronted her but she purposely texted the girl with disablities. 

  
A few weeks go by, and a church leader asked if we could grab coffee. I knew instantly that she was going to ask about this, and she did. She told me that I was blunt, and it could have been done nicer (I asked for her opinion). However, she does see my intention. Something that threw me off is she said I shouldn't have gotten involved, period. I told her; Who was going to defend the girl then? In my head, it was a predetermined decision. Ella has never cancelled plans with me, and she was complaining about having to buy the girl dairy queen. I felt very disrespected because, I've bought Ella's food before. After all, that's what you do for friends; she couldnt have just done it this once? The church leader even brought up the fact that Ella had paid for her dinner before. That led me to ask the question: Then why does Ella treat her differently than the rest of us? In my eyes, it's very plain and simple to see, it's the disablity. The leader told me I should have prayed on it more and asked God for help. However, I believe God did want me to say something. I have very good intuition only because of God. I really do see it as a gift. The next day, I read this in the group study: ""¬†Be on your guard; stand firm¬†in the faith; be courageous; be strong.¬†^(14)¬†Do everything in love."" (1 Corinthians 16). 

  
In my eyes, I did it out of love for someone who is mentally weaker. The fact that she texted her after instead of me was what irritated me most. Now she is kinda playing victim, telling everyone it was too stressful for her; but guess what? You did not have to make plans in the first place, then. It was a problem she created. I feel like I am leaving out a lot. 

What does the bible say about this, specifically, standing for others? What does the bible say about things I could improve? And what does it say about confrontation? 

  
PS: I am sorry I don't mean to spread drama or talk down Ella, I am just very frusterated at this situation. I cannot believe in the big 2025 we are treating people with disablities like this AT CHRUCH! ",1,1756145193.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

My boss is having the city shut off our power ( something about tempature acclimation. I'm not sure, it's all last minute and a mess and she gave us no warnings) Friday, Monday, and next Thursday. I work Friday so she wants me to come in a day earlier than my usual schedule and has asked me if I can switch shifts. 

But we're slightly over staffed, plus we have a lot of volunteers as well. If I go in I'll end up just greeting people, or pretending to do work on the computer that I actually completed a week before the deadline, which she knows I finished already. 

There's no work to do. 

I also don't want to go in on Thursday because that's when the director is in. Normally I only see her Friday but this week she made sure to come in on days I was working, followed me around, micromanage everything. I got lectured for a book on the shelf being off by a fraction of a centimeter. She also took my computer several times to go through my search history. And criticized the way I smile and the volume of my voice. Both that I was too loud and too quite. That I said hi too fast or not fast enough. She even criticized my choice to drink hot chocolate instead of coffee. 

So how do I tell my boss I don't want to go in a day earlier. That it conflicts with my schedule? 

And what do I do if she takes the Thursday hours out if my sick pay or vacation hours? I've heard rumors that she might do this. Instead of giving us vacation hours for power outages or snow days like a previous director did. We'd be losing PTO instead, if we are unwilling or unable to come in on a different day. 

I need all my PTO for when I have surgery late this year. I only work 20 hours a week so I don't get much. I live in California if this helps with advice. And it's just a customer service job. 

My thing is, if she'd choosing to turn the power off. Then I should get holiday pay, since she only have me 3 days warning about the schedule change. And is technically asking not telling. ",2,1756145124.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

She is also turning 30 and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a really big deal‚Äù to her.

I told her we can do whatever she would like to do for her birthday. I also kept asking her what she wanted as a gift. She kept saying I want a dog. I really didn‚Äôt want another dog but she had asked many times for another one. About 2 weeks before her birthday I bought her a golden retriever puppy for $1000 dollars. I surprised her with it and let her know it‚Äôs an early birthday gift since puppy just hit 8 weeks old. She loved the dog.

Fast forward to when we are closer to her birthday. She said she wanted to have a seafood boil at our house with all of our friends the Saturday before her birthday. And on Monday she wanted to go out to a restaurant just her and I. Our garage was a bit messy from our wedding decorations sitting in boxes everywhere so Saturday morning I spent hours cleaning, and decorating with the balloons and other shit. It took me 8 hours to get the place cleaned out and the party setup. This was not cheap, between decor, sea food, alcohol, her expensive ass cake she wanted it was around $400 dollars. She loved the party. 

The night of the party when we were going to bed she said ‚ÄúI need a coffee in the morning because my coffee maker is being cleaned‚Äù. This is when I realized she wants a whole birthday weekend. So I woke up Sunday morning, walked her dog, (she has only walked him once) and got her a coffee from Dutch bros, the place with the most annoying employees ever. I give her the coffee, she‚Äôs happy, and I ask her what she wants to do today. She said she wants to go to Trader Joe‚Äôs. I personally feel like I‚Äôm in everyone‚Äôs way at all times in that store, but we can go there for her. We go to Trader Joe‚Äôs, shop, stop on the way home to look at our new house that‚Äôs being built that I fully financed because she hates our current house, then went home.

At this point I‚Äôm tired as hell and I feel like I‚Äôve been running around doing/buying everything to make her happy for a long time now. I sit on the couch while she‚Äôs in the kitchen scrolling on her phone. Finally a moment to relax. I put the brand new mission impossible movie on. She instantly says ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want to watch this‚Äù. She also says, ‚Äúfine watch whatever you want and I‚Äôll just do something else‚Äù. Once she did that she left to the other room and closed the door. Mind you, I haven‚Äôt even gotten through the intro of the movie. I pause it, go talk to her, she is furious. She said this is her birthday weekend. I start to feel like she has been ungrateful for everything I‚Äôve done for her recently and I start to get irritated. I convince her to come back to the living room and pick something she wants to watch. She said she couldn‚Äôt find anything. I start cooking dinner for her that she requested. I made homemade chicken Alfredo, homemade Caesar salad. She sits on the couch in silence doom scrolling TikTok. WOW what a great Sunday, let‚Äôs just sit in silence and not talk to each other all day. Now in my head I‚Äôm thinking she said she wanted a dog, a party, Trader Joe‚Äôs and coffee, and a birthday dinner on Monday which have all been arranged or done. Never once did you say ‚Äúthis whole weekend is my birthday weekend‚Äù.

Now it is Monday, I‚Äôve tried to apologize twice which I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt apologize but I did it anyways to get this over with. She has refused my apology, she only gives my texts a thumbs up, and still is not talking to me.

Am I the asshole? Or have I created a spoiled little brat.

We‚Äôre buying the [Saylor sofa from Interior Define and I need help deciding what color to go with. We have to go with a velvet-like fabric bc we have cats and they don‚Äôt scratch velvet. 


We‚Äôre replacing a very shitty sofa that we bought in classic Millennial green. I really enjoyed the color but I know it feels very time-stamped. Though that‚Äôs not a huge con for me.¬†


We originally went into this thinking we‚Äôd go a peacock or colbalt blueish teal. After trying a blue sheet on the sofa it feels it might be too imposing in the room.


I RENT a west-facing apartment but the living room is SO DARK. The darker color feels like it could soak the light up too much.¬†


Now we‚Äôre considering the ‚Äúchambray,‚Äù a more blue-gray, almost neutral color. Though, should I be looking towards a gold/golden brown? Should we stick to the green hues similar to our current sofa because we know it works? Embrace the deep blues bc that was the original intent and who knows where we might land after this place?¬†


Ideally I want this sofa to last 5-7 years so I don‚Äôt intend to change it until it falls apart.¬†


I don‚Äôt want to redo the whole apartment. I am passively looking for a new coffee table/side table but I‚Äôd be buying it second-hand. It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwhen I see it, I‚Äôll know it‚Äù shopping.¬†

1mzxu9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mzxu9m/something_was_wrong_about_ms_katzs_garden/,Something was wrong about Ms. Katz's garden,"When I first met my neighbor, Ms. Katz, she scared the shit out of me.

I was walking up the cracked sidewalk to her front door to introduce myself because I had just finished moving in and wanted to start getting to know my neighbors. The house was uniquely large compared to all of the other homes on the street; adorned with steep slanted roofs and vertical wooden framing, a cacophony of plants bursting over the back yard fence on either side.

It was the house that ended the street; the pavement of the road and sidewalk abruptly cut off into grass.

The door was thick wood that looked like it weighed a ton. The brass gargoyle door knocker rapped loudly, echoing into the house as I stood for a moment waiting for a reply. I jumped when a creaky voice from my left said,

‚ÄúHello there Deary.‚Äù I turned to look down at a cheery old woman‚Äôs face that was wrinkled in a closed-eyed smile. I was startled, it felt like she had scared me on purpose.

The backyard gate slammed shut and I noticed that the old woman was wiping dirt off of her hands; she must have been gardening. ‚ÄúHello to you as well! I just moved in next door.‚Äù I said, trying to be friendly.

‚ÄúWelcome to Belmont Avenue, my name is Catrina Katz, just call me Katz deary.‚Äù She opened her eyes and continued smiling, but I was taken aback again. Her eyes were yellow. Very yellow. They looked like sickly saucers of spoiled milk. My apprehension turned to empathy for Ms.Katz - yellow eyes can mean liver problems, something my own grandmother had struggled with it for years.

‚ÄúI just wanted to say hello, I am going to go get back to unpacking, you should come over for dinner sometime! Nice meeting you,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I will deary,‚Äù Ms.Katz said, then she turned back towards the backyard gate, glancing one more time at me before getting to her gardening, and I went back to my new home, which was filled with boxes that needed my attention.

That night I slept poorly, the house was dead quiet, the only noise was the air conditioning unit kicking on every once in a while.

I am a very light sleeper, so that‚Äôs why I woke up when a strange noise started permeating through the edges of my sleepy consciousness.

There was a sound so quiet that a normal person would have slept through it*.* I lay covered in my bed, sensitive ears straining to discern what the noise was. It sounded like someone was digging in mud.

I sat up, trying to quiet my breathing so I could hear where it was coming from, but my wooden floors made the sound reverberate from all directions in my room. I could not work up the courage to get out bed and investigate, something told me I should just lay down and put on some white noise to ignore it.

Every night for a week did just that, ignoring the noise and getting some decent sleep.

When I asked my other neighbor Todd - a nice middle-aged truck driver- one day if he had heard the noise he said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it,

‚ÄúI bet you it‚Äôs Ms. Katz. You can catch her out pretty late sometimes. Between you and me, I think she has a bit of dementia. Just a bit. She loves her gardening. I‚Äôve even seen her doing it at night which is weird but to each their own. She must love it. She imports special fertilizer all the time. Here comes a truck now.‚Äù He nodded towards her house.

A van pulled into the driveway. It had a purple flower logo on the metal siding that was indeed befitting of a fertilizer company. A burly man dressed in all black greeted Ms. Katz at her gate and started carrying brown sacks into her back yard. She noticed us watching and gave a cheery wave to us, while we waved back Todd said,

‚ÄúReally sweet woman. I‚Äôve known her for years. She‚Äôs been living on Belmont Avenue as long as anyone can remember. Makes great apple pie.‚Äù

I decided to see the garden for myself that afternoon.

I made it look like I was cleaning my gutters, which to be fair, were disappointingly dirty no thanks to my landlord. I stood up on my roof to peer over the bushes spilling into my back yard, only then realizing what a jungle Ms. Katz‚Äôs backyard was. Bushes, flowers, vines, short and tall trees, birdbaths, stone pathways, you name it. If Ms. Katz was really doing it all herself, it had to have taken up all of her time. The garden was in pristine condition and scattered throughout the yard were the large brown fertilizer sacks, some ripped open with black soil spilling out.

There was a smell that rose out of the backyard and drifted towards me as I studied the garden. A sickly-sweet stench that was quite pungent. I could see lavender, rose and dracaena flowers so it was possible they were responsible for the strange odor.

Something was wrong though. A part of my brain was reminded at the time of how my grandfather‚Äôs large liquid fly traps smelled when they were full to the brim with dead insects. I was also reminded of rancid meat you discovered had been molding in the back of your fridge for weeks.

An itch on the back of my neck grew while I was scouting. It took me a minute to notice the yellow eyes peering at me between large purple curtains out of the corner of my vision. I was startled and turned to look back at Ms.Katz, unsure of how long she had been staring at me. She waved and smiled, nodding towards her garden like It was quite special before going inside.

I couldn‚Äôt be sure but before I turned to face her I could‚Äôve sworn she was looking at me with a face contorted in utter hatred.

It was 9 nights ago when I watched Ms. Katz die.

When I woke, I was confused. I could make out the soft noise from nights before that still somehow demanded every ounce of my attention. I looked to my nightstand and realized my phone was not playing my white noise, I must have forgotten to turn it on.

I decided it was time to confront Ms. Katz. If she really did have dementia, maybe I could just talk to her and she would realize she should be asleep and not doing whatever weird shit she was doing in the middle of the night.

I crept through the house, slowly opening the back door. The sound of crickets and rustling leaves mixed with the digging noise that was now sharp and clear. I could not stop myself from approaching a peephole in the fence.

When I was a few spans from the fence the sound suddenly stopped. I froze, waiting. A rhythmic thumping noise started coming down over the fence. What was she up to now? I had to know what she was doing. One eye closed, I peered through the hole into the back yard.¬†

The back yard looked like it did when I last saw it, winding stone paths now illuminated by moonlight. More fertilizer bags were open and the garden beds were torn up like plants were being rearranged.

I quickly found her. Ms.Katz was on a ladder pulling at one of the fertilizer bags which was stuck in one of her second story windows. Pulling does not properly describe the motion. Ms. Katz was throwing her body weight faster than what seemed possible away from the window, the bag inching with each heave. She thrashed again and again and again. It looked like it hurt. It looked like her arms should have dislocated.

I started panicking, clearly Ms. Katz had more than ‚Äúa little bit of dementia‚Äù like Todd had said. I needed to help her, to get her to a hospital and make sure she was mentally sound. But it was too late.

Suddenly Ms. Katz lost her grip on the bag, the cloth tearing from the tensile force, and in an instant was falling off of the ladder. She was weightless, air whipping her stained nightgown about while she plummeted. A pit formed in my stomach when I saw where she would land, the inevitable becoming more terrifying with each second.

*SPLAT.*

One of the short concrete bird baths that had a pointed house had completely pierced the abdomen of the elderly woman. I stood frozen while I processed what was happening.

Not a single cry was uttered. Her death was instant, a hole the size of a basketball oozing blood where her stomach had been made me fall to knees and retch into the grass.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 as I started frantically searching for my dinky ass Walgreens first aid kit. An operator picked up.

The operator asked in a calm voice,

""911 what is your emergency?""

‚ÄúMy neighbor is dead! She fell off a ladder and impaled herself on a bird bath!"" I yelled, panting as I sprinted down the sidewalk.

The operator was clearly used to these kinds of calls, ‚ÄúOk slow down sir. What is the address?‚Äù

‚Äú414 Belmont Avenue. Please hurry! Please!‚Äù I stammered out as fast as I could,

‚ÄúWhat is her name sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúCatrina Katz. She‚Äôs bleeding please-‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, is this a joke?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I‚Äôm telling you the truth‚Äù

I stopped in my tracks. I was so high on adrenaline I couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had at least eight calls like this in the past year. Ms. Katz has always been fine when we respond.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understa-‚Äú

‚ÄúShe is an elderly lady who does not need this harassment. I will not repeat myself. If you call again, I am sending an officer to arrest you for misuse of the 911 line. Goodbye.‚Äù The operator hung up.

The only sound left was my heavy breathing. I found myself walking towards the backyard gate, my momentum was the only thing that kept me going.

I pushed open the gate, scanning the backyard. There was no ladder laying on the ground. ¬†Ms.Katz was gone. Somehow she was not skewered on the bird bath as she had been a minute ago. I kept moving forward, unable to stop myself from approaching the bird bath.

It was clean, its undisturbed state mocked my fear and panic. There was no blood, but when I touched the concrete bird bath house, it was warm.

I felt a pit in my stomach; the world was spinning around me. My head was pounding.

‚ÄúDeary, what are you doing this time of night?‚Äù a sweet voice said, I whipped around. I felt like I was sinking into hysteria.¬†

The back door stood open, the wooden arch frame filled by Ms. Katz‚Äôs figure. There was no obvious sign of a gaping stomach wound, she appeared to have just woken up. She was looking at me, concern plain on the wrinkles of her face.

I could see into the house. A few old lamps were turned on. I could just make out old some ornate furniture covered in dust. The inside of the house certainly matched the outside.

There was something that caught my eye. It was one of the large fertilizer bags with the purple flower logo. Torn open and spilling over a wooden table onto the floor, the bag was not full of black soil. The bag was full of a bright flesh, indiscriminate chunks glistening in the lamp light.

‚ÄúDEAR! I SAID ARE YOU OK?‚Äù, Ms. Katz yelled, snapping my eyes away from the bag of flesh. She was no longer a sweet old woman who wanted to make sure I was alright, her yellow eyes were strained open, demanding an answer from me, an explanation,

‚ÄúI uh‚Ä¶ I thought‚Ä¶‚Äù I stood there, mouth working, I couldn‚Äôt think. ‚ÄúI heard some commotion, I wanted to make sure everything was alright,‚Äù I stammered out, it seemed impossible that I was talking to someone that I just saw die. I felt nauseous. Doubt was flooding my mind. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Ms. Katz‚Äôs face eased into her usual sweet smile,

‚ÄúNo commotion deary. I promise you everything is alright. Go back home and get some rest. I am sure you will forget all about it in the morning‚Äù She looked at me, still smiling, but the smile did not reach her eyes, ‚Äúit‚Äôs late. People go missing at night so you better be careful.‚Äù

She turned and slammed the door.

I did not sleep that night. Instead, I turned on every light in the house and locked myself in my bedroom. I played the events of the night over and over again in my head. Every time I convinced myself it was real, I would convince myself I must have dreamed it; had some kind of lucid nightmare. But nightmares don‚Äôt leave 911 calls on your phone history or dirt strung throughout your house. Nightmares don‚Äôt live next door.

In my shaken state come morning the only thing to do was to go to work. Work was consistent, and I figured it would sort things out for me to pretend everything was normal.

After I downed a third cup of coffee I strode out the door, the sun catching on morning fog welcomed me to a new day.

Todd stepped out of his door right after me. We nodded to each other, Todd‚Äôs expression soured when he saw something behind me. ‚ÄúNone of my damn business,‚Äù Todd grumbled around a cigarette in his lips. I turned to see what he had seen.

A van with a large purple flower logo was backed up to Ms. Katz‚Äôs house, a few men unloading fertilizer bags. A part of me wanted to be drawn back into the events of last night. I pushed it down.

I decided Todd was right. It was not any of my business.

A full day of work set me back to a sense of normalcy. Pushing pencils for eight hours really clears your mind.

That night was silent, and I slept sounder than a hibernating bear without the need for a white noise machine. I waved to Ms. Katz when I saw her on my excursions out of the house. She often was garbed in gardening clothes, going in and out of her backyard. None of my business. For six days all was well.

Until I woke up three nights ago, soaked in sweat, muffled screaming filling my room.

I once had a friend of mine lose his arm. We were playing on some rocks in a forest during a camping trip, jumping back and forth between larger boulders, taking turns giving chase to one another. I was laughing while I chased my friend, both of us grinning ear to ear while we played.

My friend was climbing higher and higher up the slope of the mountain, taking each gap in one big stride at a time, taunting me to catch him. Just before my little pointer finger could reach out and tag him, he lost his footing and slipped.

I watched as my friend fell towards the ground below, and stood frozen as he began screaming in pain, bloody arm raised in the air, bone snapped in half at the forearm, sharp white bone dangling in two directions.

I had never heard so much pain expressed before. My friend screamed until his voice was raw, thrashing about on a rock below. If I had acted sooner, running down the mountain to grab our parents, my friend might have saved his arm. But as a kid I just stood frozen to the spot, unable to move.

I was frozen then, in my bed, as I listened to the pain unfolding before me.

‚ÄúHelp me please! Oh god! Oh god!‚Äù, it was muffled, the words could just barely be made out, but the pain was sharp and visceral.

A part of me wanted to roll over, turn on the white noise machine, and pretend I hadn‚Äôt heard anything. But I knew what I was going to do.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, forcing myself to take one step after another towards the house next door. There was no doubt this time. This was real. I needed to be braver, to not freeze, to help this person. The screaming grew clearer as I approached the house, slid through the gate and approached the back door.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry! I promise‚Ä¶.‚Äù the voice screeched. It was definitely coming from her house, I had to stop whatever was going on. I reached for the door,¬† knife held at the ready, swallowing when my hand grabbed the knurled knob and began to twist.

‚ÄúI cant! I..‚Äù, the yelling suddenly cut off, stillness now deafening. Somehow the hinges of the door slid across each other smoothly, silently revealing the darkness of the house. Once inside, I let out the breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding as quietly as possible.

I moved through the room, past the old furniture, subconsciously aware of the bags of flesh strewn about, of the smell of death so rank I would normally empty the contents of my stomach. Passing old pieces of furniture covered in must, I found myself walking on kitchen tile, then rounding a doorway to face a steep wooden stairway.

Time started falling forwards on a fixed track, I was floating up the stairs. I barely noticed the loud thud that sounded like a deflated basketball was dropped.

Heat radiated from above, I was entering a tropical oven. The plaster of the walls was damp and rotted, wood molding visible in bare patches. A squelching noise started coming from upstairs and washing down over me.

I continued to move slowly towards the noise. At the top of the stairs was a hallway with closed side rooms and an open door at the end of the hall, the room behind the door illuminated by a sickly yellow ceiling light creeping out into the hall. Before I knew it I swung the door open, revealing the horrible scene inside.

It has taken me these days since that night to rationalize what I saw behind the door at the end of the hallway. In the moment my brain put my body into shock, I continued to act but was not comprehending how absolutely horrifying it all was.

The floor was covered in dirt and flesh. The two substances were mixed together to form a paste that was thick and gelatinous.

Ms. Katz‚Äôs head was staring at me, upside down in the mush, eyeless sockets fixed in my direction. The decapitated head looked something like a pale Jack-O-Lantern after weeks in the sun, all of the flesh had been scooped out from the inside. I could see through the eye sockets into the pale skull. The base of the head where the neck should be revealed a perfectly calcified circle that looked like a doll head might when you wrung it off of the body, a spacious cavity where a brain should be.

I peeled my eyes from the ground and looked forward.

A table was in the middle of the room. The rest of Ms. Katz was hunched over the table sitting on an old wooden stool. Her body was convulsing as something I couldn‚Äôt see was ripping into the chest of a dead body sprawled on the table. It must have been the person I had gone to save. Slurping and crunching filled the room.

There was screaming, it took me a second to realize that I was screaming.

Slowly the rest of Ms.Katz sat up from the table in the chair, out of the stump of her neck what looked like a slender frayed rope started stretching upward towards the ceiling. Brown and glistening like an insect carapace, slowly its head started rising from the dead body on the table, pulled upward until it was almost touching the ceiling. Tendrils roughly a foot in length sprouted like fuzzy antenna in all directions along the vine-like neck; they constantly moved and twitched as they felt their surroundings.

The head was covered in the same wriggly feelers, blacker than those on the neck. Once the head had risen almost five feet in the air, towering above me as an unholy obelisk, it twisted around to stare down at me.

Insect mandibles twitched and chomped, flesh smeared and stuck to the mouth area, falling down to the ground with thick splashes. The head was smaller than the discarded shell of a head on the ground by my feet, but the eyes were the same. The yellow eyes were large, bulging out of the hard carapace, no eyelids to conceal their bulbus shape. Its eyes were fixed on me, pure malice penetrating me to my core.

The next few moments occurred in the blink of an eye. Rapidly the tendrils of the neck started pulling the creature back into Ms. Katz. Each tendril would shoot down into the old woman‚Äôs body, accelerating the head downward. Sporadic jerks animated the her corpse, arms shooting out, a seizure of movements unfolding before me until the insectoid head was the only visible part of the parasite, resting on the body‚Äôs neck stump.

All was still, a standoff had begun. In shock I was rooted to the spot, a pit of dread opened up in my stomach and I became aware of my heart pounding in my ears.

It leaped toward me, pushing off the ground so hard I heard the floor break, crashing into me with force enough to break my ribs, sending us hurtling back through the hall way towards the stairs. On the ground we struggled, I somehow managed to grab its shoulders and pushed with all of my strength as it tried to pop my head open with its layers of jaws.

A full throated roar came out of me and I heaved us down the stairs. Each step smacked on the way down, at the bottom I rolled into the kitchen onto my back. I had broken ribs and an ankle twisted the wrong direction, so all I could do was crawl backwards from the stairwell door, where I could hear snapping sounds that meant it was getting up.

It forced Ms.Katz body to its feet, one arm disolacted and jutting upward, standing naked in the dark doorway. A fleshy stomach hole was filled with twisted knots of insectoid spaghetti where the bird bath had pierced through the body. ¬†Its eyes were two yellow orbs of light swaying back and forth in the darkness of the doorway.

I noticed a shovel at my feet and frantically grabbed for it. I was too late. In the same moment I made my move, some of the knotted tendrils of Ms. Katz‚Äôs stomach wound shot out towards me.

The wet tendrils were thick and flew across the kitchen, striking my left shoulder and digging into my flesh. The muscles of the arm seized. My muscles were forced to contract harder than my brain would allow. Every single muscle cramped at the same time. My biceps relaxed as my triceps continued to flex which caused my arm to hyper extend. Bones cracked and my arm broke. I cried out in pain.

‚ÄúOh deary, I love the way you scream‚Äù it spoke to me with a voice that was broken, full of hateful mirth. It sounded like Ms. Katz was speaking while gargling crumbled bones. Suddenly my biceps flexed, snapping my arm the other way, my limp hand smacking into my shoulder. All I could do was grind my teeth and moan.

With my free arm holding the shovel I swung at the tendrils, severing them. It let out an ear blistering screech, insectoid head thrashing. Enraged, it crouched then lunged for me once more. I was ready this time.

Screaming my throat raw, I swung the shovel and hit it right between its eyes. One instant the shiny black mouth was going to tear my throat out, the next the carapace exploded, green slop flying in all directions. The body went limp and oozed all over me, tendrils seeping out over me onto the ground. The pungent smell of Ms. Katz body, old perfume, and rotting insect meat singed my nostrils. I could barely breath with all of the weight bearing down on me.

My shock wore off and panic set in. I frantically tried to push the corpse off of me, my hands slipping again and again, suffocating instigated desperation deep within me allowing me to drain the last of my strength to finally roll it off myself. Then I lay alone in the silent house.

I started sobbing. I took massive uncontrollable heaves of air into my body and let them out through tears and groans. I could not stop until every last possible emotion had been wailed out of me.

Once I was done, I stood numbly, used the shovel to limp my way out of the house, and packed a bag. I got into my car and rode out at dawn.

After a stop to the local urgent care where I told a true enough story about a bad fall down some stairs, I had a boot for my foot and bandages for my ribs. I drove as far as I could and stopped at a motel.

Three days later I am now writing from my third motel, slowly making my way back home, where I am going to try to forget all of this mess, and start over.

I am not sure what happened to Ms. Katz‚Äôs house or the bodies inside, and I don‚Äôt care. I needed to tell my story online because no one I know will believe me and because I am not sure if I will live to tell the tale anyways.

Every motel that I have stopped at has the same van that parks in the back of the lot at 3 am when I should be asleep and not notice. A van with a purple flower logo. They leave at 6 am before I should wake up.

I noticed each time because I have not slept since that night. I know I have nightmares waiting for me when I finally crash, but I am not ready to face them yet.

So, last night, at 3 AM, I wake up to loud screams of homeless people fighting each other. Last weekend, there was a m\*\*\*der (homeless people fighting each other). There's also always homeless people in alleys. They mostly keep to themselves of course but some of them behave strangely. They try to speak to you or grab you.

I watched a report recently where the owner of the Montreal forum himself deplored how the police wasn't even intervening in time when they would call to report a problem. He himself had been attacked TWICE. The owner of a coffee shop next to Dollarama next to the cinema VIP building was also attacked as a homeless man broke their glass.

What is going on? It feels like it's getting worse. The high raise building projects around the area were probably planned and built to drive the homeless away but none of that seems to have had any effect and the area starts to feel dangerous at night. Our building has security thankfully but even then it's not enough and one time a homeless guy tried to follow a woman inside so security intervened thankfully.

Does anybody know if anything is being done about this?

EDIT: What is the best area to move to that is close to the metro with recent buildings and less homeless? I  am thinking we might end up having to move to LAVAL or Brossard.",2,1756144775.0,montreal,14,0.56,False

1mzxmxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mzxmxf/cortisol_optimization_andrew_hubermans/,Cortisol Optimization: Andrew Huberman's Counter-Intuitive Strategy on the Morning Peak,"A common piece of health optimization advice is to delay caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking to avoid blunting the natural cortisol spike. A recent analysis by Andrew Huberman proposes an opposing view: for an optimal circadian rhythm, you should instead maximize this peak: [Video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNdYuuhxv85/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=dWd5aWxlemI1Z2J3) 

# The Fundamental Principle: A High Peak for a Rapid Drop

The proposed paradigm is that the health of the circadian cortisol rhythm doesn't depend on suppressing the morning peak, but on the speed of its decline throughout the day.

A healthy cortisol rhythm is characterized by a very high peak within 30-60 minutes of waking (the Cortisol Awakening Response, or CAR), followed by a rapid drop and low levels during the afternoon and evening.

# The Mechanism: The HPA Axis Negative Feedback Loop

* **HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal):** This is the system that regulates cortisol production. It operates via a negative feedback loop.
* **Low Peak Scenario:** A low or slow CAR sends a moderate feedback signal to the HPA axis. The consequence is a slow, gradual decrease in cortisol. Levels therefore remain relatively high for longer, which can be detrimental to afternoon energy and sleep preparation.
* **Robust Peak Scenario (proposed by Huberman):** A deliberately amplified morning cortisol peak sends a very powerful and rapid negative feedback signal. In response, the HPA axis ""overcompensates"" and much more drastically reduces cortisol production for the rest of the day.

The result is high morning energy, followed by a more pronounced state of calm in the afternoon and evening, which is optimal for performance and sleep.

# Clarification on the Impact of Caffeine

The main objection to drinking coffee upon waking is its effect on cortisol. Huberman points out that research indicates that in regular consumers, caffeine's effect on acute cortisol secretion is significantly blunted, if not nonexistent, due to the body's habituation.

# Practical Protocol to Amplify the Morning Cortisol Peak

To implement this strategy, the goal is to stack powerful waking signals within the first hour of the day:

1. **Light Exposure:** Get 10 to 15 minutes of daylight exposure (preferably outside) as soon as possible after waking.
2. **Hydration and Caffeine:** Consume your caffeine source (coffee, tea) during or after light exposure, without waiting the 90-minute delay.
3. **Movement:** Incorporate light physical activity (walking, stretching, a few push-ups) to increase body temperature.

# Summary

The goal is not to avoid the cortisol peak, but to structure it: a sharp, intense peak in the morning to ensure low levels for the rest of the day. This dynamic is fundamental for daytime energy and sleep quality.

After taking the M14D to the M15 I went to the second clue location and used my SBS ticket as a ""card"" to keep track. Nothing much happened there.

I went to the third location and asked for a pen. The pen had a Zohran sticker (which was probably on accident) and I didn't need to draw a star for that location lol. I went to the fourth location and nothing much happened there but I tried to meet up with a friend there who was at the fifth location. We caught up there and had a small interview at the end.

The sixth location was kept a secret to those who didn't have cards (like me). I had a little help there on what the hint was but it was meant for those who had a card so we didn't want to crash it. That was my day.

[VectorVest was built for that crowd](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/vectorvestevergreen?cid=vectorvest99centlabordayaug25_rddt). For a limited window, new users can try the full platform for 30 days for **$0.99** (regularly $9.95). It‚Äôs a low-risk way to see how a rules-based stock analysis system fits into a real portfolio.

**What** [**VectorVest actually does**](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/vectorvestevergreen?cid=vectorvest99centlabordayaug25_rddt)

VectorVest ranks and times stocks using a simple framework aimed at everyday investors who still want pro-style structure. The platform‚Äôs signal is straightforward: identify quality, avoid weak names, and act with timing‚Äînot vibes.

https://preview.redd.it/90ple7t8e7lf1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c07035982d88381f1df26a0eadadd27ad52e1e

**Useful angles for real portfolios**

* **Beginner stock market research platform** with plain-English ratings.
* **Dividend stock screener with timing signals** for income investors who hate buying right before a dip.
* **Swing trading stock picks** and **watchlists** for part-time traders who only have evenings and weekends.
* **Portfolio risk management for retirees** who need less guesswork and more consistency.
* **Backtesting for retail investors** to see how a ruleset would have behaved before real dollars get involved.
* **Mobile stock alerts app** so decisions aren‚Äôt chained to a desktop.

Nothing mystical‚Äîjust a consistent lens for evaluating entries, exits, and position quality.

**Who tends to get the most from it**

Investors who:

* Want a **beginner-friendly stock analysis software trial** without a steep learning curve.
* Prefer **clear buy/sell timing**, not message-board opinions.
* Like **rule-based screening** for growth, value, and dividend strategies.
* Need **portfolio tracking** that calls out weak positions before they become expensive lessons.

If stock selection has felt like throwing darts, a month with a ranking system can be eye-opening.

**What‚Äôs included in** [**the $0.99 / 30-day trial**](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/vectorvestevergreen?cid=vectorvest99centlabordayaug25_rddt)

* **Full access to VectorVest 7** for 30 days
* **Dr. DiLiddo‚Äôs e-book,** ***Stocks, Strategies & Common Sense*** (a $24.95 value)
* **VectorVest Mobile App** (a $19.99 value)
* **The Successful Investor Quick Start Course** (a $95 value)
* **100% money-back guarantee** on the trial
* **Friendly support** if setup help is needed
* **Access to the VectorVest investor community** for Q&A and real-world use cases

That‚Äôs a month of live screening, timing signals, and training materials for less than a dollar. Coffee costs more‚Äîand coffee won‚Äôt flag a tired stock before earnings.

**How investors typically** [**use the trial month**](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/vectorvestevergreen?cid=vectorvest99centlabordayaug25_rddt)

1. **Set a simple goal.** Examples: ‚ÄúBuild a dividend growth watchlist,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTest a swing strategy with strict exits.‚Äù
2. **Run the built-in screens.** Start with pre-built filters for quality, momentum, or income.
3. **Create watchlists.** Track candidates and let the timing indicators do their thing.
4. **Paper trade or size small.** Verify signals with real market movement before committing meaningful capital.
5. **Review weekly.** Keep winners that still rank well; prune laggards without sentimentality.

# Strengths that stand out

* **Clarity.** Simplifies buy/hold/sell decisions into a digestible signal, helpful for investors who want a steady routine.
* **Consistency.** Same rules, every day‚Äîideal for avoiding spur-of-the-moment trades.
* **Education.** The e-book and Quick Start course speed up the learning curve so the 30 days don‚Äôt go to waste.

# Things to keep in mind

* **It‚Äôs still the market.** Signals help; they don‚Äôt guarantee outcomes. Risk management matters.
* **Discipline required.** The system works best when rules are followed, not cherry-picked.
* **Short trial = focused testing.** Arrive with a plan so the month answers real questions.

# Pricing snapshot

* **Trial:** 30 days for **$0.99** (regular $9.95)
* **Value of included training and app:** $24.95 + $19.99 + $95 in listed resources
* **Guarantee:** 100% money-back on the trial period

For searchers: *‚ÄúVectorVest 30-day stock analysis software trial,‚Äù ‚Äúlow-cost stock market trial under $1,‚Äù ‚ÄúDIY investing research platform for beginners,‚Äù ‚Äúdividend stock screener with timing,‚Äù ‚Äúswing trading stock ranking system.‚Äù* 

**Bottom line**

For self-directed investors who want a month to road-test a **stock ranking and timing platform** without committing real money or time to a long contract, the [**VectorVest $0.99 trial**](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/vectorvestevergreen?cid=vectorvest99centlabordayaug25_rddt) is a clean way to evaluate a rule-based approach. Use the 30 days to build a watchlist, run screens, paper trade signals, and decide if this style of structure fits the way capital is managed.

**New users can start the 30-day VectorVest trial for $0.99** and get the platform, the e-book, the mobile app, and the Quick Start course in one go. If it doesn‚Äôt feel right, the guarantee covers it.

1mzxfri,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1mzxfri/can_the_best_toaster_and_kettle_combo_from_haden/,Can the best toaster and kettle combo from Haden upgrade your kitchen,"The Haden 406751 toaster and kettle bundle truly caught my eye with its nostalgic yet modern design. I decided to put the set to the test in my busy family kitchen, hoping it would add style while offering dependable functionality. The blend of steel and copper lends the appliances a sophisticated air, almost as if they‚Äôve leapt straight from the pages of a high-end interior design magazine. From the aesthetics alone, these appliances had already earned some countertop real estate.

**Design & Build Quality**  
What struck me first is how the Haden 406751 feels both retro and cutting-edge at once. It has this classic vibe that fits beautifully in kitchens styled with vintage touches or even more modern setups aiming for character. The wide slots for the toaster are a thoughtful feature, especially for someone like me who enjoys thicker artisan breads. The stainless steel and copper finishes offer more than looks‚Äîthey resist smudges and scratches from daily use. It also helps that this duo is fairly compact, saving precious countertop space while still making a bold statement with its design.

**Ease of Use**  
I must admit, I‚Äôm not a morning person, so breakfast appliances have a lot of pressure to perform fast and stress-free in my house. Setting up the kettle was a breeze, and with its 1.7-liter capacity, it‚Äôs perfect for boiling water for teas and French-press coffee, plus the occasional instant oatmeal when my child insists on a quick breakfast. The toaster‚Äôs self-centering racks make a noticeable difference. Whenever I used baguette slices or bagels, they toasted uniformly without needing mid-cycle adjustments‚Äîa small yet impactful detail for busy mornings.

**Key Benefits**  
- Classic yet contemporary design stands out on any countertop.  
- Wide slots and a self-centering feature ensure even toasting for all bread types.  
- The 1.7-liter capacity kettle serves optimal family or small gathering needs.  
- Adjustable toaster settings, including a defrost mode, make it versatile.

**Performance**  
In terms of performance, both the toaster and kettle exceeded expectations. The adjustable control settings on the toaster allowed me to dial in the ideal browning for my multigrain bread without burning edges. Testing the bagel setting was a surprise win‚Äîit toasted the cut side while warming the outer crust perfectly. The kettle operates quickly and quietly, boiling water faster than my previous model without that annoying screech some kettles emit. Even when packed into hectic mornings, these appliances kept up effortlessly.

**Negatives**  
Not every appliance comes out flawless, and the Haden set isn‚Äôt immune. While generally reliable, the toaster occasionally felt sluggish when toasting multiple batches back-to-back. A second issue I encountered was with the kettle lid‚Äîit tends to get stuck, requiring a bit of unnecessary force to open. Considering it‚Äôs part of a premium set, I would have loved to see smaller but impactful things like temperature control on the kettle.

- Some intermittent sluggishness when using the toaster repeatedly.  
- Kettle lid occasionally sticks, which can be frustrating.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Haden set to other appliances on the market, some competing brands, like Breville or KitchenAid toasters, offer more advanced controls‚Äîthink presets for different breads and electronic timers. Additionally, brands like Cuisinart produce kettles with multiple temperature settings, which could appeal to tea buffs. However, where the Haden pair trumps its rivals is in its harmonious design, compact build, and surprisingly even toasting performance. While rivals may pack extra features, they lack the unique charm this toaster and kettle duo carries.

**Price Performance**  
For the price, you‚Äôre paying for much more than functionality‚Äîthis set upgrades your kitchen's aesthetic appeal while also proving useful day-to-day. If you‚Äôre someone who values style alongside convenience, this is worth considering. Admittedly, more feature-packed devices exist at similar price points, but they won‚Äôt bring the same timeless charm. Practical, beautiful, and durable, this bundle strikes a solid balance.

Written for the Savannah Mirage Blog on Patreon by TLA Kavolwa.

A still breeze came from the west, everyone raised their faces from their phones and looked around. We were in a circle around the flame which had burned continuously for the last seven days. Every other night this characteristic breeze came. Visitors from the city who came to help us with our predicament had long gone, like three days ago. Everyone here knew exactly why they remained so whatever business they got engaged in, they never forgot to watch out for the signs.

No one briefs those remaining for this purpose, no one even organizes it. It is out of sheer volition. During this period most tough customs are relaxed, it‚Äôs like a holiday in honor of the deceased. In-laws can shake hands, eat together and even get drunk from the same pot.

Everyone is super vigilant, scanning their neighbors‚Äô face and throwing a random short question but with deep vocabulary like, ‚ÄúThis squall is an aberration,‚Äù then looking straight into their eye for a reply. The assumption is that everyone present comes from around or can be identified by someone from around. If one fails the test, it is still okay but is then compelled to explain how this happens. So after every breeze, there follows a sudden surge in noise across the compound which soon subsides in the third minute as everyone successfully explains themselves.

You will occasionally hear one prolonged conversation, and if you are keen you‚Äôll notice everyone deeply interested in it. Those who know anyone in the conversation will come for flimsy reasons. ‚ÄúWhat is the time my child?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow comes you aren‚Äôt feeling cold?‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúThank heavens I have found you!‚Äù

It is a silent code that none of these questions matter so no one struggles to answer them perfectly, all is required is to tie an invitation to the conversation into the answer. Something like, ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not cold, I‚Äôm lost in a conversation with my friend here.‚Äù Then the other goes, ‚ÄúHa-ha, over what now? We are mourning for God‚Äôs sake!‚Äù and then joins the conversation steering it towards identity with a ‚ÄúWait, where does your friend come from?‚Äù

Now depending on where the conversation has reached, the intruder will either answer themselves or the common friend might help. If the answer makes perfect sense the interest subsides and they are left alone. If not, more scrutiny questions keep popping up. The weirder it gets, the more people keep joining.

They will run you through a series of questions and wherever you claim to come from, someone from there or near there is likely here. It is therefore common to see visitors haunting visitors with questions like, ‚ÄúYou say you come from Bellyrood? Where exactly because I‚Äôm also from Bellyrood.‚Äù The haunting takes a professional turn until the intruder demonstrates real native knowledge of Bellyrood. If not, it takes a confrontational turn. It escalates to serious levels and to the real question, ‚ÄúWhat brings you here?‚Äù

This is the final question, there usually are no more questions going forward. Any more question is taxed. This is how they identify a corpse thief.

Here corpses are stolen. Especially if the deceased died a sudden death that did not incapacitate their physique. A perfectly normal person who died in a road accident won‚Äôt be stolen. The same goes for a person who has ailed for a long time. But those succumbing to poisoning, murder, heart attacks and other similar causes are a great target.

My friend‚Äôs cousin had died of electrocution. We came here two weeks ago and by now I‚Äôm fairly known. My identity is uncontested. I still keep close to him because that‚Äôs simply how it works here. But he doesn‚Äôt smoke so occasionally I have to excuse myself for this compulsive need. The homestead is big but smoke is best under a tree so I hang around the periphery of the home or into the bananas and sometimes further into the farm. Crops have been trodden down so I‚Äôm not damaging any, they were long damaged by the night discos that were here for three nights leading up to the burial day.

I‚Äôm also not alone here, neither am I creative or super inventive. It is just a thing we smokers do here. My packet is in my trench coat‚Äôs inside pocket right about my chest. It has pockets on both sides so I do a double tap; the left hand pats the right side and the right hand pats the left. It is in the left. I squeeze my trouser pockets simultaneously and then one hand in my back pocket to check for my lighter, I find it in my back pocket.

That weird breeze or gust comes again so I can‚Äôt light my cigarette. I know the gust, so I hastily but maturely begin making towards the fire. This gust is unique, it is actually a breeze but it can shake trees and drop leaves. It can raise dust off the ground and other mighty works which a breeze should not achieve.

I arrive to that surge of murmuring that accompanies it and I‚Äôm now on the receiving end. ‚ÄúThe squall is an aberration.‚Äù An old man with yellow teeth, clearly a smoker, tells me. I smile like we all do when a weird situation is still green. I scan the fire for my friend and oops! he is not there. ‚ÄúPardon me, I‚Äôm not from around,‚Äù I reply to the old man knowing well the green situation is about to get yellow.

‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù he asks, staring at my brown trench coat which has caught some blackjack seeds and then at my godfather which makes me stand out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Sedgy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSedgy?‚Äù he replies, wondering how that answers the simple question he asked.

‚ÄúAnd where does Sedgy come from?‚Äù

His look has gotten philosophical, a steady inquisitive focus with a borrowed patience.

I quickly realize Sedgy is not known here. I am in the wrong flame. I wish I had gone procedural and said where I come from, so now I try my luck. ‚ÄúI come from Bellyrood. South Bellyrood.‚Äù I look at them with eyes of hope because Bellyrood is not that far from here.

‚ÄúDo you know Oakman?‚Äù one of the faces replies.

‚ÄúYes I do. I come two kilometers south of that. It is actually my nearest shopping center.‚Äù I look at him but then realize he is not content with my answer.

‚ÄúWhich Oakman are you talking about?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúOakman shopping center with Greenspan Supermarket,‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúGreenspan?‚Äù

It is clear that I‚Äôm not making any progress when another guy raises his stooping head to reveal his face illuminated by the orange light from the flame. ‚ÄúThere are many Oakman, which one do you mean?‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt look me in the eye, a sure sign of rage.

‚ÄúBellyrood County Oakman,‚Äù I clarify.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù he raises his voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Bellyrood and we have three Oakmans there. Which Oakman?‚Äù

Now that is an absolutely new fact to me. I am twice puzzled and my face gives it away.

‚ÄúTalk!‚Äù goes another man. He was reclined on his chair with his head facing the sky. This conversation must have taken a third turn for him to sit upright and stare into my eyes.

Time to throw out my big card. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Pastor Delib‚Äôs son.‚Äù My dad is popular, his church towers that sleepy shopping center. It is the biggest in Oakman.

‚ÄúPastor‚Äôs son!?‚Äù around three guys exclaim simultaneously. Two are seated on each of my side, to my left a skinny man with no heavy cloth on but with a cap and to my right that old man who was questioning me. Another exclaimer was totally new to me, he had not spoken until now.

‚ÄúBut you smoke?‚Äù the new guy asks sarcastically.

I‚Äôm embarrassed and have also embarrassed the church and dad and mom and congregants. And then goes another man, ‚ÄúYou are too big to bring in your dad. Can‚Äôt you just explain yourself like a man?‚Äù

They all laugh somehow easing the tension which gives me a chance to try again. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I begin, ‚ÄúI am Bellyrood from Oakman, my clan is Denz and our house of Minty.‚Äù Their faces glow especially of the two guys seated on each of my side.

‚ÄúSee? We are brothers,‚Äù the cap guy joyfully remarks.

‚ÄúImmediately I saw your face, it felt familiar. I can spot a Denz a mile away. So, what brings you here?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúAh, I have a friend here, the deceased is his cousin.‚Äù This is exactly how you explain relationships with the dead. You don‚Äôt say cousin to the deceased. Nope. Wrong. The deceased comes first. He takes the center stage. So a dad for example will say, the deceased is my son. Not I‚Äôm father to the deceased. I pass this subtle booby trap with much accolades from them. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a nice young man, he knows how to speak.‚Äù

The situation here is controlled now but the wind comes once more and a few more times. I‚Äôm still chilled by the encounter and remain silent, sleep creeps in. I‚Äôm woken up by someone kicking my leather boots.

‚ÄúYoh bro, bro,‚Äù he calls on me, kicking at my foot. I wake to a cup of tea right on my face. It is five and everyone is preparing for the day. This is the time to clean up. The bathrooms are makeshift, some have sheets for doors, some have sacks as both doors and walls. Others are planted round like a tiny maze. They don‚Äôt have anything else. Waking up early is part of the design consideration. There is enough light to see without a torch but not enough to see clear figures through the bush or should a breeze blow the door open.

All the seats around me are empty, I‚Äôm the only one in the whole compound still seated so I stand to make even. My eyes catch a glimpse of a loosely gathered crowd at the other end of the homestead. They seem concerned and deliberating.

‚ÄúWhat is down there?‚Äù I ask my friend, pointing to the crowd with my cup of tea.

‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù he begins, holding his cup with both hands, ‚Äúsomething has happened.‚Äù

I know what he means.

‚ÄúTragic,‚Äù I reply, trying to look the most remorseful I can.

He understands my suppressed curiosity really well so he begins walking in that direction. ‚ÄúThe guy is gone.‚Äù He repeats again with his head stooped, his eyes looking at his footsteps, ‚Äúthe guy is gone.‚Äù

He is disappointed more than I have ever seen him before so I‚Äôm lost at what I can do. I reserve my comments and actually the silence feels therapeutic. We walk to the spot listening to our heavy clothes making weird brushing sounds.

The grave is sunk and a few visible cracks run but one dominates. His cousin was a social person and when a man who knows how to live with other people dies, bulls are brought to fight at the grave. The result is that the ground is more compact and flatter than what you‚Äôd typically find. It is one sure way to tell whether a grave belongs to a man or a woman.

‚ÄúThese incidences are increasing of late,‚Äù remarks a random old man, wise enough to understand this kind of thing. Everyone‚Äôs mood is low and contemplative. Women are sobbing and cursing round the grave.

If you knew what happens with the corpses, this instance becomes more painful than even death itself. The stolen corpses are walked during the night, when day comes they are hidden somewhere safe like overgrown river banks or young sugarcane plantations until night falls again. They walk about 40 kilometers and into the neighboring country where they proceed for another sixty before reaching the land of the Gasok people where they are sorted to various grades before being put to specific use.

The possessed bodies of women do weeding while the men do first digging. The work they do is diverse but most importantly the possessed bodies are whooped and threatened. It is slavery of the dead. It is said that you can hear whips lashing through still night until shortly before dawn. That you can hear sounds of metal clanking which is hoes being hit against each other to remove wet clay and grass that sticks on them every then while digging.

The Gasok people are serious farmers, they produce much of the food their side of their country eats. They plant bananas where it is said that the corpses dig ditches for planting because they do deeper ditches. The deeper the ditch the longer the banana will be able to last, tolerate winds and yield big without breaking.

They also produce cereals, like sesame and millet, it is said these are a preserve for female corpses since they are more watchful. They do the sowing, weeding, threshing and winnowing. They also produce cassava which is harvested by uprooting. This is a preserve for male corpses. They harvest and bring the bulky produce to the farmer‚Äôs house where female corpses peel and leave them to ferment before eventually drying them.

After a while the corpses wear. Their arms are dismembered, and cured stiff. They are used as a stirring stick while fermenting millet flour for making rum.

The sun is rising and our work here futile, everyone finds it hard to bear the shame so they start leaving. I think hard for an excuse and remind my friend about the story I was supposed to write for my Patreon. He nods in approval so I walk to my car. It is a low-key recession. The city people are gathering around their now idling private school bus which had not coughed for the past eight days.

A man from the gathering crowd spots me and gives me the hitchhiker‚Äôs eye. I know it before they even ask, but I ignore them and reverse out my car which I had parked nose-in along the hedge of a recently cleared bush. I‚Äôm going straight to the city, I‚Äôm afraid of going to Oakman, I may meet with someone who saw me smoking.

The gentleman helps me back up giving me hand signals and scattered verbal advice against tree stumps. ‚ÄúDo a full turn, yeah exactly, now back up slowly.‚Äù I make use of my side mirror but he discards my caution. ‚ÄúNo, everything back here is fine, just back up.‚Äù

I‚Äôm left trusting a stranger who now has a lady carrying a suitcase by his side. The lady is silent and I dare guess hopeful.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say looking at him with a weak wave and a smile.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù he replies.

I‚Äôm about to rave on but as soon as the wheels start rolling he goes. ‚ÄúWhere are you headed friend?‚Äù looking at me with a contagious pure heart. Honesty possesses me and I reply, ‚ÄúCity. I am headed to the city.‚Äù Actually by now I have considered how lonely travelling alone is going to be and was open for suggestions.

‚ÄúCan we tag along? I can chip in on fuel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù I reply.

He thanks me for the kind gesture, explains how his wife vomits in the bus, then signals the suitcase lady. We are off.

I pass Oakman at a good speed and I hear them murmur, ‚ÄúThis place has not developed.‚Äù I look through the rearview mirror and catch the woman‚Äôs eye. She looks away and points to the very road that goes home, ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs still a dirt road.‚Äù

It is apparent that they are from around so I ask boldly, ‚ÄúYou guys know this place?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes we do.‚Äù The lady jumps on before the man, ‚ÄúWe are from this place. We are Denzs from the house of Minty but we have been in the city for a really long time.‚Äù The man arrives two seconds late into the conversation.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great,‚Äù I reply, looking into the rearview mirror hoping to catch someone‚Äôs eye.

‚ÄúWe are brothers,‚Äù I exclaim. The lady is visibly happy but not the man. I know why. You see the lady is too comfortable, she hasn‚Äôt realized how incriminating that one statement is. You can‚Äôt marry from your clan or house. It is possible with bigger clans but not Denz. I quickly assess the situation and devise a plan to salvage it.

These two were married against the customs and may never return there because they are in effect outcasts. This topic is sensitive and the lady seems to have now realized what she just did. Her face goes dim in an instant, she pulls tighter on her shawl and rests back into the seat. The man remains upright and exudes some willingness to proceed with the conversation in some way.

‚ÄúThe funeral,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúwhat do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely something,‚Äù he replies.

I notice with my peripheral view, his eyes searching for eye contact in the rearview mirror but I keep my eyes on the road. This signals a certain form of disinterest in the topic so he proceeds.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs all about how we bury.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow we bury?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúHow do we bury?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you go there?‚Äù he asks me. I look for his eyes in the rearview mirror so he can assess my honesty. ‚ÄúI had gone to help a friend mourn; the deceased is his cousin.‚Äù

My answer is satisfactory because he is my brother anyway. So he delves deeper.

‚ÄúYou see friend, we used to bury with good real wood coffins. They were rigid and take longer to soak. They also could bear serious weight, that‚Äôs one.‚Äù

He is eager to see how receptive I am so I approve of that assessment.

Around that time life hit me hard and I got so busy with girls, school, being in a band, and drinking too much that I lost interest in gaming. I went from spending countless hours every week staying on top of gaming news and renting/buying most big new releases to playing street fighter with my roommates only. 

Now life has hit me hard again. In the span of 3 months I lost my fianc√©e, my car, my house, my job, my grandfather, my dog‚Äôs days are numbered, and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Schizoeffective disorder. 

I‚Äôm doing all the right things to get myself back on track and I‚Äôve got tons of support. My parents let me move back in with them and they‚Äôve agreed to let me borrow their cars until I find something I like and then they‚Äôll throw a down payment on it for me, I took an easy job at coffee shop so I can pay for my car and be forced to pretend like I‚Äôm a normal sane person for a few hours every day, I‚Äôm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, I enrolled in school to finish my degree, and I got a gym membership. 

The problem is that even with all of that going on I still have tons of free time when I‚Äôm too sore to work out/ my boss gives me a day off. So, I thought I‚Äôd get back into games. 

Back in the day I used to LOVE Halo 1-Reach, RE4, Rock Band, Tomb Raider 1-3, Lego Star Wars, Mass Effect, Quake 3, Kingdom Hearts 2, Oblivion, Arkham City, Fallout 3. 

I‚Äôve recently played Armored Core 6, Arkham Knight, and Uncharted 4. I loved those games, but I‚Äôm not sure what to play next. I‚Äôve tried just browsing Steam and the PS5 store for games but it‚Äôs kind of overwhelming since I hardly know what franchises and developers are quality anymore.

1- *Delinquents in this school are actaully quite different. Basically its more of a competition againts eachother instead of just bullying or being assholes. Theres 4 main delinquent ‚Äúfactions‚Äù or groups. So far i only made like‚Ä¶ One‚Ä¶ And that is Knightly‚Äôs group by u/supercomplex_Wolf some info about this group is that they are the biggest and the main one of the 4. Their leader is well- Knightly. Being the Main Delinquent. As for what the 4 groups do they mainly just‚Ä¶ Fight eachother. There‚Äôs not really much to say since the rules are kinda very strict so they dont really have much to do other then just‚Ä¶ Fighting. They do go all out in school events or tournaments however.* ~~this one may change.~~

2- *The Reason why Inizio is ‚ÄúLoved‚Äù by most of the other monsters is because he‚Äôs seen as their saviour. Mainly due to how many times he has let them out or escape. He isint ACTAULLY loved however.*

‚Ä¶

*Maybe. LOOK. the monsters arent controlled by me. I dont choose what the monster avatar does except the one who created it or owner. The monsters do whatever! This does mean that some of them are probaly yandere maybe idfk.*

3- *Most teacher‚Äôs have a unique class they have for themselfs. Basically! Each teacher has their own class. Its that preety simple. How it works is more complicated but i‚Äôl give info about that later.*

4- *Speaking of teachers! Here‚Äôs a list of all the teachers we have so far!*

Rossa. ~~By u/Extra-Plum-3044~~

Nemesis & Epiphany ~~By u/Excellent-Pay-1670~~

Horatia. ~~by U/Zenova2~~

Martin Portman. ~~By u/ColonoRizzo007~~

Kai. ~~By u/RealGodsspeed22~~

Moth. ~~By u/TheBeeMan255~~

Lenny. ~~By u/Both-Confusion3560~~

Erik Grimm. ~~By u/Revolutionary-Bet594~~

James Park. ~~By u/whylol_bruh~~

Cyo. ~~By u/Freshavocadoo btw i came up with the name on the spot.~~

Glitchpot. ~~By u/MyLifeIsAnAccid3nt~~

Oswald. ~~By Ok-West1~~

Prisca. ~~By u/Zeroblaze1963~~

Bert. ~~By u/Darkbert550.~~

Coffee. ~~By u/TrafficSevere9923~~

Takeru ‚ÄúRetro‚Äù Shimamoto ~~By u/SonicFan1429 cool ass name btw.~~

Caveman Joe. ~~By u/Far_Pin1440 He‚Äôs a Subsitute but still a teacher.~~

Bigman.  ~~By u/BucketTagger~~

Joey. ~~By u/jeff_i_am_pro~~

Harry Percant. ~~By u/LeMatSot~~

E.V.O.M ~~By u/Straight_Mobile3261

*And thats all so far. More will be added. ~~eventually.~~ but so far these are all the teachers canon.*

*Do note that all of them have their own unique class or some share their class if they teach the same subject. So far only 2 classes have been shared. Those being human anatomy with nemesis and epiphany. And gun safety and rules with Lenny and Moth. For the people that own these avatars however if you DONT want to share your class then message me and i‚Äôl try to think of a new subject your avatar teaches or you can suggest it. As for the ones that arent you guys can maybe talk with the other people if you wana share a class or smt.*

5- *Inizo actaully spends most of his time locked up sleeping. Mostly because there‚Äôs nothing better to do then just singing to himself or messing around in the classroom. He‚Äôs a quiet and heavy sleeper by the way. So most of the sounds he hears during the school dosent really wake him up aswell. unless its right at his door or in his room. Its of course not advised to wake him up since if you do he‚Äôll greet you with a super loud Sound that will echo through the school. Which can potentially give ear damage or make people deaf.*

6- *Each student actaullys still looks the same from the universe they came from. Like lets take Bayo from u/Organic_List397 since he came from FPE he would constantly have this paper background or ‚Äúartstyle‚Äù with them. For other avatars that like came from 2D then they would have their drawing style or smt. The only ‚Äúdifference‚Äù they have is being 3D and becoming humanoid.* ~~this one may be removed if it gets too complicated.~~

*Anyways thats some extra trivia lmao. I got nothing else so just have a list of songs Inizio sings out of boredom with his own versio*

Stereotypes by blur

Blood and Bones (by a long ass name im lazy type)

Nothing man by sodikken 

Missus Piano by Rio Romeo. ~~Fun fact almost all AU versions of Inizio and the original know how to sing this.~~

Other friends! 

*Anyways hope this post was good because i plan on making some Interactions with people‚Äôs avatars next post.*

*Most Notably being Feng & Inizio, Bayo & Aurelia and etc etc.*

my kitchen is organized and usable,   
there is a spot on the couch that sags slightly because its so used to me being there it doesn't revert to how it was built in anticipation of me coming back to it.

[Signs of Morning Depression](https://preview.redd.it/jv6hfnn5c7lf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50708f0558e073efa29ab86ab928b3cdad4ab87a)

Do your mornings feel unbearably heavy, as if the day has defeated you before it has even started? Depression in the morning can make the day feel impossible before it even starts.

Simple tasks like getting out of bed, making coffee, or answering a call that used to seem normal daily tasks all of a sudden become enormous barriers to get past. You feel drained even before the day has truly begun. It's the weight of depression pressing hardest at the start of the day that has a chance to begin. Understanding the struggle is the first step towards healing.

**Signs of Morning Depression:**

\- Can‚Äôt get out of bed

\- Heavy, slowed movements.

\- Angry, irritable, snapping at your partner

\- Tearful, sad, hopeless, or suicidal thoughts

\- Hitting snooze or switching off the alarm

\- Can‚Äôt make coffee or breakfast

\- Morning sex feels like a chore

\- Avoiding calls, skipping the gym

\- Late for work, things take much longer

\- Difficulty concentrating on tasks

\- Feeling physically heavy¬†

\- Withdrawal from morning conversations

\- Loss of personal hygiene

**Why Morning Depression Matters:**¬†

¬†Morning depression can badly throw off daily life because it becomes tough to start the day and perform day-to-day activities. Addressing it is crucial, as it may indicate an underlying mental health condition, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder.

**What to Do If You're Struggling:**

\- Acknowledge Your Feelings:¬†

Let yourself feel emotions without judgment.

\- Seek Professional Help:

A psychiatrist can help in understanding your symptoms and guide you towards care.

\- Establish a Routine:

Set a structure in place, like waking up at a consistent time and exercising.

\- Practice Self-Care:

Simple activities like drinking water, going on walks, can make the mornings feel a little less heavy¬†

\- Stay connected with family and friends:

Regular check-ins from family and friends can help alleviate loneliness¬†¬†¬†

\- Consider Therapy:

Therapeutic approaches like CBT can help you shift your thought pattern

**Is Morning Depression treatable?**

Morning depression is almost always treatable. It is important to see a psychiatrist who will look at the whole picture.¬†

\- Screen for underlying medical causes¬†

\- Screen for additional stressors such as work, relationship difficulty, academic, and financial stress

\- Consider medication if symptoms are impacting your life¬†

\- Start therapy¬†

\- Implement lifestyle changes

**Does Medication help with Morning Depression?**

¬†It can dramatically improve morning depression but you should consult an expert if you are considering medication.

**Lifestyle tips that can help with morning depression:**

\- Set your alarm to music that lifts your mood¬†

\- Listen to the radio¬†

\-Call a friend or loved one¬†

\- Forever yourself out of bed¬†

\- A cup of coffee may offer a temporary boost¬†

\- Take a shower¬†

\- Get dressed¬†

\- Leave the house, go for a walk

\- Start going to the gym¬†

\- Morning aerobics can be done online¬†

\- Yoga and meditation can help¬†

\- Get a dog or a cat if you are an animal lover¬†

\- Tell your partner¬†

\- Ask for support

*Lifestyle changes can definitely help.*

However, the definition¬†of [depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/GabaTelepsychiatry/comments/1mzx8ng/signs_of_morning_depression/) used to be '**learned helplessness**'.

If you are feeling so low that lifestyle changes do not help or only work for a bit, you may really be suffering from depression.

Depression in the morning is a real and tough condition to have. Always remember one thing: you are not alone in this. With support, patience, and compassion, your mornings can start to feel a little lighter. Every step matters, so hold on to yourself because gentler mornings are possible.

I've been a DM for roughly 4 years with plenty of experience both DM'ing and playing the game. We will be using the newest version of D&D (2024).

 I'm more of an exploration kind of DM and thus most of my story telling will be of that sort, but that does not mean that other elements and aspects won't be present such as roleplay and combat.  This campaign is played on one week on, one week off schedule due to my work, might change depending on that or holydays, or until all the players are available for weekly sessions. We typically use Discord for voice and sometimes our webcam, though not mandatory, and Roll20 for combat.
 
Players at the moment are level 9 and are in a precarious situation, being knocked out by their enemy... a lovely moment to meet other such adventurers! 

Being present in the session is mandatory, attending it, if not by inescapable situations, is also, as we only have 2 sessions per month, missing one of the sessions can be demotivating.

Mostly looking for players who are really eager to dig their jaws into a new world and create a character in such, wanting to roleplay and interact with the world around them, anyone who is experienced and not is welcome to join im more than willing to teach you the ins and outs of this system! 

If this interests you, please send me a friend request at ubylux on discord and we can discuss things through there! See you around!

YNAB paired with watching Caleb Hammer's Financial Audit changed my spending behavior *significantly*. I am debt-free, have a healthy emergency fund, and have a net worth that's almost 10x greater than it was 5 years ago.

I was talking to some friends about it this weekend. What I thought was going to be a positive conversation, sort of turned into a roast where the general consensus is that I am basically an idiot and that budgeting should not cost you anything. They seem to have very compelling arguments against using the app and I'm questioning myself now. 

Even though YNAB saves me more than $15 a month, they suggested that I should just pay attention to my credit card/bank accounts and track them in a spreadsheet. They said that it would take less than an hour a week to do this and it's really not worth $15 to just not open your bank apps. 

One person said that they used the now defunct Mint and said that it did the same thing that YNAB does but was free. Now that Mint is gone, he simply uses the Chase app to track his spending breakdown. He said that it tracks his expenses down to categories like dining out, etc. 

I argued that Chase and Mint looked at the past whereas YNAB looks at the future and makes you really assess where additional spending comes from. Every time that I stray off my entertainment or dining out budget, I need to pull from a future vacation and that makes me stop. My friends say that if I give myself a budget for dining out, having discipline and not breaking the budget achieves the same thing.

I also mentioned that the app helps me realize that even though I have plenty of money in my account, I really can't afford to get this $5 coffee because I am behind on my IRA contribution for next year. They said that me just looking at my free spreadsheet and having even a little will power would, once again, do the same thing. They said that YNAB put me on the right track, but that I should prioritize getting off the app. 

Does YNAB's appeal really just boil down to laziness of not wanting to open bank apps and a lack of will power and discipline? ",4,1756143516.0,ynab,42,0.64,False

4. Location and Set  
Police station breakroom. Standard beige tile floor, vending machine in the corner, old microwave on a small metal counter. Wall clock ticking loudly.  

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
Primary:  
- Officer Dan (in uniform, looking into the camera mid-coffee sip).  

Supporting (Background):  
- Officer Ruiz and Deputy Mike, arguing silently in the background, gesturing toward the microwave. Ruiz tapping the microwave door; Mike pointing at a lukewarm burrito on a plate.  

Officer Dan leans casually on a folding chair, the vending machine humming beside him, deadpan as chaos simmers two feet behind him.  

6. Visual Style  
Hyperrealistic 4K, natural breakroom lighting from fluorescents above. Colors are muted‚Äîbeige walls, flat blue uniforms‚Äîemphasize the mundane. Shallow depth of field keeps Dan in sharp focus while the background skirmish blurs slightly.

1mzx5f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1mzx5f4/reflection_on_separationdivorce_and_what_ive_been/,Reflection on Separation/Divorce and What I‚Äôve Been Learning,"I want to share some things I‚Äôve been working through personally, but also what I‚Äôve learned are some of the top reasons why many men struggle to adjust after divorce. Some of these are very real for me, and others are examples of the broader struggles men face

1. Overestimating Healing Speed

I‚Äôve caught myself saying, ‚ÄúI should be over this by now.‚Äù That thought makes me feel like I‚Äôm failing.

What it may look like for others:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been months, why am I not dating yet?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOther guys seem to bounce back faster, what‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIf I just get back out there, I‚Äôll feel better.‚Äù

Reframe: Healing is not a race. Taking longer doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm failing, it means I‚Äôm doing the work for real.

Habits that help:
	‚Ä¢	Set a healing pace with no deadlines.
	‚Ä¢	Write one sentence a night about how I felt that day.
	‚Ä¢	Celebrate small milestones like ‚ÄúI went a week without reaching out.‚Äù

2. Emotional Addiction to the Ex

I long to hear from her. I want that text. I still feel like she‚Äôs the only one who can make me feel loved.

What it may look like for others:
	‚Ä¢	Checking social media or old photos.
	‚Ä¢	Driving by familiar places hoping to see them.
	‚Ä¢	Replaying old messages or voicemails.
	‚Ä¢	Keeping a casual connection just to feel close.

Reframe: What I crave isn‚Äôt only her, it‚Äôs the feeling of being wanted. That doesn‚Äôt mean she is the only one who can give it. 

Habits that help:
	‚Ä¢	Keep a ‚Äúvalidation journal‚Äù where I write down one strength or accomplishment every day.
	‚Ä¢	Text or call a friend when I want to reach out.
	‚Ä¢	Replace the craving with something I enjoy like exercise, music, or hobbies.

3. Stubbornness and Fantasy

I sometimes think about how amazing she seemed, but I‚Äôve come to realize much of it was a facade.

What it may look like for others:
	‚Ä¢	Saying ‚ÄúThey were my soulmate‚Äù even when the relationship was toxic.
	‚Ä¢	Believing ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only one who will ever get me.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Holding onto anniversaries, gifts, or traditions like they still mean the same thing.
	‚Ä¢	Romanticizing ‚Äúforever love‚Äù as if letting go is betrayal.

Reframe: Holding onto fantasy is holding onto pain. I need to face the truth, not the facade. 

Habits that help:
	‚Ä¢	Make two lists: the fantasy and the reality. Read the reality when nostalgia hits.
	‚Ä¢	Ground myself by naming three flaws I ignored.
	‚Ä¢	Ask myself, ‚ÄúWould I want a friend to go back to someone who treated me this way?‚Äù

4. Fear of Being Alone

This one is big for me. I feel the emptiness and fill it with distractions. I tell myself I‚Äôm not worthy, and that is my hardest battle.

What it may look like for others:
	‚Ä¢	Jumping into rebound relationships just to avoid loneliness.
	‚Ä¢	Using alcohol, porn, or overworking to avoid empty time.
	‚Ä¢	Never spending a weekend alone, always surrounding themselves with people.

Reframe: Being alone doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm unworthy. Alone is where I face myself and rebuild. 

Habits that help:
	‚Ä¢	Take myself on weekly solo outings like coffee, a hike, or dinner.
	‚Ä¢	Spend 10 minutes a day in silence without distractions.
	‚Ä¢	Set one small daily goal and complete it to build self-worth.

5. Using the Ex as a Backup

I still hold on to hope that she might come back.

What it may look like for others:
	‚Ä¢	Staying ‚Äúfriends‚Äù online but secretly hoping for reconciliation.
	‚Ä¢	Texting or calling for small favors just to keep contact.
	‚Ä¢	Sleeping with the ex now and then, even while dating other people.
	‚Ä¢	Keeping them in mind as a ‚Äújust in case‚Äù option when new relationships don‚Äôt work out.

Reframe: Hope can keep me chained to the past. If I leave the back door open, I never fully step into my future. 

Habits that help:
	‚Ä¢	Do a ‚Äúhope detox‚Äù by writing down what I‚Äôd miss out on if I keep waiting.
	‚Ä¢	Ask a trusted friend to be my accountability partner in keeping no-contact.
	‚Ä¢	Create a short list of things I want to build for myself this year that have nothing to do with her.


Some of these patterns are real for me, others are struggles I know many men face. What I‚Äôm learning is that letting go isn‚Äôt just about my ex. It‚Äôs about letting go of illusions, habits, and lies that keep me tied to the past. Each time I reframe the thought and practice healthier habits, I take another step toward becoming stronger and rebuilding myself. The emotional component of this is extremely difficult. But I have come to find that these habits have helped, even if it‚Äôs one percent. So, I hope it helps you too.

This is my first post on this subreddit, but I was waiting to have my score in hand before I write one.

Now that i'm done with the GRE (unofficial 324 - 162Q, 162V), I feel that I'm ready to apply for good MBA programs outside of the US and Canada. A few details about me which I think would be relevant for your kind suggestions/advice:

1. Nationality: Indian (27 year-old female)

2. Undergrad: BA Economics (Honors) from Christ University, Bangalore (3.67 / 4 GPA)

3. Industries: Finance & Investment Ops (4 yrs) > HR tech startup (7 months) > Fintech startup (6 months, ongoing)

4. Work Experience: 4 years with JP Morgan India in Asset Management > 6 month break to prep for GMAT (595 score) > 1.5 years at two startups

5. Current Designation: Founder's Office at an early-stage 0-1 fintech based in India, primarily leading 0-1 GTM + marketing & branding + SEO/GEO + bit of compliance & internal ops + B2B sales & partnerships

6. Key Work Wins: 1 promotion in JPM, Employee of the year award + other notable ones

7. Thought behind MBA: Want more structure to my functional niche + income growth + go back to a bigger org 

8. Post MBA Goal: Consulting (want to relocate and work for min. 5-7 years outside India)

9. Desired Geographies: Europe (IESE, IMD, Esade, INSEAD), Asia (HKUST, NUS), Australia, Germany, Denmark maybe

10. International Exposure: Never traveled abroad, worked with onshore teams during JPM stint

What I'm Looking For From This Post/Community:

\- what MBA programs & colleges can I target with this profile?

\- are there any other fitting MBA alternatives I can look at to achieve these goals, like a Mfin, MiM, etc. (although I feel that neither of these give you the same level of finality as MBA from an academic pov)

\- what's the job/employment scene like now, which geography is OK with indians coming in and working peacefully? one of the reasons i'm not even entertaining US/Canada/Ireland is because of all the horrible stuff i've heard from my friends/in the news about how indians are treated in these regions

I know I'm quite late for R1, but would like to apply for R2 or R3. I want to be admitted to a program and start attending exactly 1 year from now (Sep 2026).

Please do let me know if i'm missing anything and how can i best go about shortlisting the right programs! Also, don't mind meeting up for an exploratory chat if you're in Bangalore (coffee/beer on me) - thanks so much in advance!

1mzx1g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuditaKompakt/comments/1mzx1g0/mudita_and_light_i_choose_kompakt/,Mudita and Light - I choose Kompakt,"So, I thought I would try to organize some of my thoughts as to why I chose the Kompakt as my daily driver. I hope this helps.

**Background & Setup**

I acquired my Light Phone 3 (LP3) in March and the Mudita Kompakt in May. The e-ink display drew me in due to my long-standing appreciation for the Light Phone 2. Both devices ran on Mint Mobile's 5GB plan, and I regularly switched the SIM between them during my testing period.

Both the LP3 and the Kompakt, NA edition, traveled internationally - Europe - on the Minternational plan and worked flawlessly.

I use both products ""as is"" without sideloading apps on the Mudita, and have had zero messaging issues on either device. I guess I am pretty lucky as all my phones have worked pretty smoothly right out of the box. One worries when one sees all the Mudita's for sale and the general concerns on both Mudita and LightPhone pages.

**Current Usage Pattern**

After months of switching phones almost daily, then weekly, I've settled on the Mudita Kompakt as my primary device. My current setup is:

* Daily driver: Mudita Kompakt
* Runner's phone: Light Phone 2 (perfect size for long runs and coffee shop pickup calls)
   * The LP2 is, IMO, underappreciated - love this form factor and I just have three numbers and a Lemur case with one credit card when out on a run.
* Drawer phone: Light Phone 3 (pulled out occasionally for updates)
   * I am hoping for some significant updates, to include a desktop app in the near future and I will likely revisit my stance.

**What I Miss from the LP3**

* Enjoy the aesthetics - solid construction.
* Timer functionality
* Podcast support
   * no native podcast app on Mudita and I do not sideload, so...will go back to online streaming <smile>
* Superior messaging experience - smoother scrolling, more screen real estate
* Directory integration - seamless operation with navigation
   * LP3 directory gives some good information and is, IMO, more up to date.
   * Mudita maps functionality takes a little more getting use to and has higher initial friction points.

**Why the Mudita Kompakt Wins (for me, N of 1)**

The ""Vibe"" Factor. The Kompakt delivers an intangible user experience that keeps me reaching for it over the LP3.

Privacy & Control - perhaps my #1 consideration.  I know minimal does not necessarily equal more private but it is nice when a company emphasizes the private.  Yes, Light does, to an extent, but really loses with an online dashboard.  Mudita appears more committed to opensource - find them on GitHub.

To continue, from a privacy and control perspective:

* Contacts stored locally, not on external servers
* Complete control over personal data
* Open source
* love the desktop app
   * Light does everything via its online dashboard.
* The offline+ hardware level cutoff switch - use it every night before going to bed - priceless.

Music Experience:

* FLAC support with proper metadata recognition
* Song and artist display in both the music app and car Bluetooth - this is low key underrated.
* Much easier music management - no more 30-40 minutes renaming tracks after waiting 20 minutes for Light's dashboard to upload and convert files
   * Even after I rename all my LP3 music on the dashboard, the car screen shows no artist and no song title
* Seamless handling of my large FLAC collection

Hardware & Software Polish:

* E-ink display - unbeatable in both bright sunlight and nighttime use
* Excellent battery life - enhanced by the 80% charging cap feature
* More refined software ecosystem - working fingerprint lock and other polished features
   * some small issues (e.g. no voicemail indication) but a roadmap addressing my main concerns.
* (Seemingly) Faster development cycle - Mudita team appears 6-9 months ahead of Light in ecosystem development
* More transparent communication by the Mudita team.
   * This is just my impression.  Light Team is working hard but there really is no published way ahead; just announcements made on the day of an update along with notes. It would be nice to know what they are prioritizing.
* Battery life on Kompakt is class leader.
* Feels really good in the hand - less slippery once you put a protective case
   * I have a green one and a screen protector - will likely get more colors for fun.

**LP3 Advantages - again, N of 1**

* OLED screen performance - superior in applicable scenarios
* Replaceable battery - something I consider to be a long-term advantage over Mudita's sealed unit
* Nice night light feature - though e-ink still wins overall for low-light use

**Development & Future Outlook**

The Light team recently pushed the 522 update, promising faster future updates. I hope they develop a desktop management app and catch up to Mudita's development pace. Both companies have admirable ethics and philosophies.

**Final Thoughts**

While I appreciate both devices and companies, the Mudita Kompakt currently provides the more complete and polished experience. The LP2 continues to prove its worth as a more specific use device, and I remain hopeful that future Light Phone updates will bring me back to reconsider regular LP3 usage.

***Much love to both Light and Mudita*** for their commitment to mindful technology.

PS:  Urszula is super responsive and a great Mudita representative on the forums.

1mzwxj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mzwxj9/find_out_if_active_coffee_machine_cleaner/,Find Out If ACTIVE Coffee Machine Cleaner Descaler Tablets Are Worth the Hype Review,"Testing out the Active active-coffee-tab-24 Coffee Machine Cleaner Descaler Tablets has been nothing short of enlightening for my daily coffee rituals. Maintaining my coffee machines, whether it's my Nespresso, Keurig, or that sleek Ninja brewer sitting in the corner of my kitchen, has always been a learning curve. These small, unscented tablets promised to simplify that process, and I decided it was time to see if they could pass muster. As someone who values both the taste of my coffee and the longevity of my coffee makers, I immediately saw the potential these tablets offered after the very first use.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility: A Major Convenience**

One thing that struck me was how simple the tablets were to use right out of the box. Each tablet came tightly packaged, and there were detailed instructions on how to apply them with various types of coffee makers. Using them with my Keurig and Nespresso felt seamless; I just popped a tablet into the water reservoir, ran a cleaning cycle, and voila! It worked equally well with my friend's DeLonghi espresso machine when I tested it while visiting. The versatility to work with single-cup brewers, espresso machines, and even classic coffee pots made these seem like a universal cleaning solution.  

[Find the best price for ACTIVE active-coffee-tab-24 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c913xxp1/)

**Key Benefits**

- Excellent compatibility across multiple coffee machine brands including Breville, Miele, and Cuisinart.  
- Convenient tablet form eliminates the mess often associated with powders or sachets.  
- Eco-friendly and fragrance-free material makes it perfect for sensitive users.

**Cleaning Performance and Taste Improvement**

I brewed a cup of coffee right after descaling my machines, and it was as if I had unlocked a new realm of flavor. The coffee‚Äôs bitterness disappeared, leaving notes of the beans‚Äô original taste untainted. The tablets' efficient descaling power made a significant difference by eliminating calcium and grime buildup while restoring the flow and temperature stability of the machines. While these aren't magic pills, after a week of better-tasting coffee, I found myself wishing I had started using them earlier. A single cleaning cycle with these tablets added noticeable clarity to what could have otherwise been another ""meh"" cup of joe.

**Strengths**

1. Maintains optimal brewing temperature.  
2. Quickly dissolves limescale and other mineral residues.  
3. Keeps internal components in pristine condition without requiring manual scrubbing.

**Packaging and Quantity**

Another aspect worth highlighting is the bulk size of 24 tablets. This pack could easily last an entire year or more, depending on cleaning frequency. Compared to some other alternatives available as single-use sachets or pre-measured powders, this is what sold it for me. On top of that, the compact packaging made storing the tablets effortless. It felt like a well-thought-out product meant for someone who values efficiency without sacrificing convenience.

**Limitations**

Not everything was perfect, though.  
- Tablets took longer to dissolve in cooler water unless preheated.  
- Specific instructions for rare machine models could be more in-depth.  
- Packaging didn‚Äôt include a child-resistant cap, which could pose risks in households with curious kids.  

**Design Choice and Eco-Friendly Material**

Another noticeable win here is the eco-friendly focus. Unlike chemical-heavy solutions that make my kitchen smell like a science experiment, these tablets don‚Äôt include any overpowering scents. The ""unscented"" promise held true: once dissolved, they didn‚Äôt leave a strange chemical aftertaste or lingering smell in my machine. If sustainability is your thing, you'll love knowing that the manufacturing also balances good cleaning performance while remaining natural.

**Product Rivals**

Having compared this product directly with Affresh and Urnex competitors, I think each brand has its strengths. Affresh tablets work well but are marginally pricier per use, while Urnex sometimes left residual tastes in my experience. Against these competitors, the Active coffee machine cleaner held its ground firmly with a blend of affordability, compatibility, and effective cleaning. Its added versatility with different machine brands also gave it a slight edge over rivals, especially if you‚Äôre managing multiple coffee makers like I am. It doesn‚Äôt completely lap the competition, but it stands out in a very crowded field.

**Value Proposition**

Considering what these tablets bring to the table, they strike a fine balance between affordability and performance. Budget-wise coffee enthusiasts who want to prolong the life of their machines without splurging on a part replacement every few years will see these as a worthy investment. Regular cleaning to extend the lifespan of appliances isn't just practical‚Äîit‚Äôs essential‚Äîand these tablets help make it easy without requiring a lot of effort.

I mean, think about it: There are people out there making ACTUAL money just by tapping around on their phones, trying out new apps before anyone else even sees them.  
Like, ‚Äúhere, play with this future Instagram, break it, tell us what you hate,‚Äù and here‚Äôs some cash.

But the part that REALLY fried my brain?

You don‚Äôt need resume Jedi skills.  
Even if you‚Äôve done absolutely nothing like this before‚Äîcompanies actually PREFER ‚Äúreal people‚Äù who don‚Äôt know tech jargon.

So, how do you even start?

- Some sites are literal scams.
- Some are legit (but keep the best apps for returning testers only).
- It‚Äôs actually UNSAFE to just sign up everywhere with your info.

But one of the spots everyone kept whispering about again and again was **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

- They literally have you test the newest, weirdest, sometimes even SECRET apps (think games, reading apps, random productivity tools, etc.).

I‚Äôm still honestly confused (in a good way) and a teeny bit shocked I‚Äôm not hallucinating, but here‚Äôs the scoop: I made $100 **from just my phone**, and all I did was test some ultra-random apps. 

Wait, what?! Yes, you read that right. $100. One DAY. No, I‚Äôm not a coder or a tech reviewer. I‚Äôm LITERALLY just a person with thumbs and a dubious wifi connection.  

So, here‚Äôs what went down‚Äîstep by gloriously baffling step:

- I stumbled onto **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (I wasn‚Äôt exactly looking for a windfall; mostly just dodging boredom).
- They have this whole thing where you sign up, pick apps you want to test, fiddle with the app, and then fill out a super short feedback form. (Some are games, some are wellness apps, it‚Äôs kinda all over the place.)
- You instantly earn a few bucks per test‚Äînone of this ""wait until you have $300 minimum payout"" stuff.  
- Payout vibes: straight to PayPal.  

**So then it HIT ME. Is this‚Ä¶ legit???**

I downloaded like, 6 apps that morning.
  
Some had me play a level, others just wanted opinions on navigation or features.  
Fast-forward a few hours later‚Äînotification pops: payout from **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. I checked‚Äî**it‚Äôs REAL**.  
Twenty here, ten there; it added up FAST. I even went back mid-afternoon because I thought, ‚ÄúThis has to crash soon, right?‚Äù NOPE. More tests popped up.

By bedtime, I had crossed the $100 mark. Like, what??  
I have worked harder ordering a coffee.  
Super random things I learned:

- They care mostly about authentic feedback, not fluff.
- Sometimes you need to keep an app a little longer, but nothing sketch.
- Each app earns different amounts (check the offer closely!)
- The highest paying tests usually have some extra survey questions but still, nothing painful.

So, real talk:  
I have been that burnt, eternally-skeptical person who thinks NONE of these ‚Äúmake money online‚Äù things ever deliver.  
But‚Äîhonest and confused truth‚ÄîI am staring at my PayPal right now in shock.  
This is actual money you can make in-between TikTok rabbit holes or while waiting for your pizza.

If you‚Äôre skeptical (like I was), just‚Ä¶ give it a try?

Here‚Äôs that link again (PS: Save it. You‚Äôre going to forget.)  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôll get rich‚Äîlet‚Äôs not get dramatic‚Äîbut $100 for, um, pushing some buttons on my phone is NOT what I expected from my Tuesday.  
Anyone else tried this or have actual tips to maximize the earnings?  
Am I living in an episode of Black Mirror?? (Someone, please confirm this is real life‚Ä¶)

Sorry, I just needed to share because, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm shook.  
Best app-testing day syndrome ever.

1mzwwg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1mzwwg3/reveal_if_pdi_screen_cleaning_wipes_really_leave/,Reveal if PDI Screen Cleaning Wipes Really Leave No Streaks,"**A Hands-On Review of the PDI PDIP03672 Screen Cleaning Wipes**

I‚Äôve had my fair share of screen-cleaning mishaps in the past, going through everything from microfiber cloths that left lint behind to sprays that somehow managed to smear instead of clean. That‚Äôs where PDI PDIP03672 Screen Cleaning Wipes stepped in, claiming to effortlessly clean electronics without the typical frustrations. After using these cleaning wipes nearly every day for my variety of gadgets‚Äîlaptops, phone screens, and even my TV‚ÄîI‚Äôve got quite a bit to say about them. Spoiler: they‚Äôre not without their quirks.

**The Practical Design of the Wipes**

These wipes come in a sturdy canister with 70 pre-moistened sheets, which is a lot more practical than having a bulky spray bottle and separate cloth. The canister is compact enough to keep on your desk without hogging too much space, and the lid has a snap-tight mechanism that prevents the wipes from drying out between uses.

The actual wipes are a generous 9""x6"" size. I‚Äôve been able to clean both my 27-inch monitor and 15-inch laptop screen with just one wipe, which speaks to their durability and moisture retention. They don‚Äôt feel flimsy in hand, unlike other off-brand wipes I‚Äôve tried, which felt more like wet tissues ready to disintegrate.

**Strengths**

- Pre-moistened with 70% isopropyl alcohol for effective cleaning  
- Appropriately sized for larger screens while still manageable for small devices  
- Convenient canister design minimizes the risk of drying out  
- Leaves no streaks or nasty residue behind  

[Check PDI PDIP03672 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b01e6begbm/)

**Performance on Various Surfaces**

I‚Äôve tested these wipes on a range of screens: my smartphone, touchscreen tablet, gaming laptop, TV, and even the glossy screen of my digital camera. They handle all surfaces rather impressively thanks to their fast-drying formula. The claim of anti-streaking checks out, especially with my TV screen which usually loves to highlight streaks from cheaper wipes.

Even when I had some particularly stubborn smudges (thanks to my toddler‚Äôs yogurt-covered fingers), a bit of added pressure while cleaning made them disappear. The anti-fogging feature also works as promised; something I noticed when I cleaned my bathroom mirror‚Äôs smart display.

**Uses Beyond Electronics?**

Apparently, these wipes also cater to medical equipment, though I personally didn‚Äôt test this. However, I can confirm their utility in cleaning glossy surfaces like glass coffee tables or my plastic monitor stand. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt advise using them on leather or wooden finishes. I accidentally wiped over the edge of my desk, and it left a slight discoloration‚Äînothing major, but worth noting.

**Limitations**

- Single-use nature means you‚Äôll burn through them faster than you'd expect  
- Not ideal for non-glass surfaces due to slight alcohol-induced discoloration risks  

**Alternative Offerings**

There‚Äôs no shortage of screen-cleaning products out there, but these wipes hold their ground against some leading competitors. For example, the Whoosh brand offers cleaning kits with sprays and cloths, which might be better for those who prefer a reusable option. On the other hand, Zeiss wipes, known for their camera lens applications, are slightly smaller but just as effective. Where the PDI wipes gain traction is on price-efficiency and sheer convenience; no spray or separate cloth required.

Compared to subscription-based brands, PDI wipes offer an on-demand cleaning solution without committing to refills or monthly orders. For a casual or semi-regular user like me, this no-strings setup is hugely preferable.

**Affordable Quality**

Discussing whether these wipes are worth the cost depends largely on how you‚Äôre using them. The quantity of 70 wipes per canister feels like good value when spreading out usage over weeks or even months. For me, as someone who works on electronics daily, the convenience and time saved more than justify the price. It‚Äôs undoubtedly not the most eco-friendly solution due to its disposable nature, but for sheer efficiency, it‚Äôs hard to beat this product.

I‚Äôve always been attracted women and men, but knew I wanted to be with a man in the long term. Aside from one brief experience, I didn‚Äôt fully explore any of my physical feelings for women when I was younger. If I watched any type of porn, it was always lesbian. But I never allowed myself to pursue it, even just for hook ups, because I felt so guilty if there wasn‚Äôt some kind of expectation that it could lead to a relationship. 

In my 30s, I started struggling with low libido, so sex was always just kind of a struggle. My husband was very supportive, but it‚Äôs certainly impacted our marriage. 

Then, after fertility treatments, I was able get and stay pregnant. Second trimester of that pregnancy came around and with it, a sex drive that I have never had in my entire life. It was like my hormones were making up for lost time. This included enjoying lesbian porn and fantasizing about women. My husband always knew I considered myself bi, and he is actually bi as well. He‚Äôs done more with men than I have with women, so I am very lucky to have a true understanding partner. We had some brief conversations about me exploring this side of my sexuality, but nothing came of it since I didn‚Äôt want to do anything while pregnant.

Had baby, libido tanked, that was that. I am pregnant again now, hormones raging. Libido is back, baby! But this time it feels different. It‚Äôs not something where I feel mostly satisfied watching a video and getting off. 

I just crave so physically and emotionally about this idea of being with a woman. My mouth doing something different, our conversations being different, dates being different, touching smoother skin. I think being in my late 30s, having a kid, developing new hobbies, and treating my depression properly has made it harder to ignore this part of myself. And I‚Äôm doing a poor job describing it. Like I just want to go on a nature walk and identify plants to forage and then make out with a girlfriend and then get coffee and go to a farmers market and then make out again. 

I haven‚Äôt felt this kind of craving since I was a boy crazy high schooler who just wanted a sweet boyfriend. But even then, when it came to sex, I was still very much attracted to women.

We moved to Capitol Hill in March after a year in the SF Bay Area, and it has been such an incredible quality of life improvement to have so many reliable public transit and walking options around us.

This weekend my partner and I got groceries, had an impromptu meetup with friends at a beer garden, and went shopping at a plant store, hardware store, and frame store all without having to drive anywhere.

In our Bay Area apartment, we couldn't even get a coffee without driving at least 20 minutes. Even where we lived in West Seattle we couldn't get groceries without a 40 minute walk one-way.

Between taking public transit most places and walking, we've felt so much more connected to our city. We tend to wander around and explore more, and find places we never would if we were driving.

I know these are just standard Big City things, but it has without a doubt improved our health and happiness. It's going to be really hard for us to leave again.

Could things be better? Absolutely. We can and should be building more housing to solve the affordability and homelessness problems. More rapid ride lines, dedicated bus lanes, protected bike lanes.

1mzws47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzws47,Day 2 Of Tenma visiting Prague without being a fugitive! (+Tips!),"Hello! So today we completed our second day on our Prague trip, hitting all of the spots featured in Monster! Today was a bit more laid-back, as the heat was insufferable; we mostly sat down and ate/drank because we were severely dehydrated. But we did have a blast!

Firstly, we went to the V√°clavske N√°m, which is one of the most commercial streets in Prague, with dozens of big company stores, lots of souvenir shops, and restaurants. It is not particularly featured in Monster, but we HAD to take this route to reach what we were looking for.

To reach the specific place featured in episode 40 of Monster, right when Grimmer arrives in Prague with that big beautiful church, we had to go to the old town square. In the meantime, we looked at the big Astronomical Clock of Prague, a tourist point you can't miss. It rings and moves every hour on the clock, so make sure to go there 10 minutes or so before. There was a very empty restaurant right in front of the clock, so we sat there and took a drink while the Astronomical clock rang.

After our drink, right next to the astronomical clock is THE PLAZA, on the Prague Meridian. The church Grimmer saw was the Chr√°m Matky Bozi pfed T√Ωnem, and the little coffee shop where he spoke with Mr. Petrov is right in front of this church! there is a coffee shop and a restaurant, but because we were really hungry, we chose to eat at the restaurant. Also, I'm finding out that Prague really loves its ducks. Almost every dish has duck instead of chicken. Tastes amazing, though‚Äîjust a fun fact!

And only after a 10-minute walk, we reached THE spot of the red tram pictured in the opening, which is specifically on Na Porici street, on the right of the shopping mall, Palladium. That's where the curve hits with those background buildings. Palladium itself is a huge shopping mall; it was fun to be around, but you had to pay for the bathrooms, and that sucked. Most bathrooms in Prague are pay-to-use, so take that into account when running to the bathroom without your phone or your wallet...! 

And finally, at the end of the day we decided to eat a typical dessert from Czechia, called Trdeln√≠k, which is a very delicious pastry you can fill up with pretty much whatever you want! you can find stores for the dessert on every corner of the street, so it's fairly easy to find! However, it's super messy to eat, and most of those locals don't have a bathroom, nor do they allow you to wash your hands. take some wet tissues in your backpack or purse along the trip; they're a lifesaver! 

  
(This is just an extra, but please, tourists, beware: we were scammed into a Black Light Theatre, which was the worst experience we've ever had. The prague black light theatre is actually beautiful, but particularly the HILT Black Light Theatre is a total scam, and for two people, 30 euros was a waste. Tourist beware! it looked hideous, and a group of Girl Scouts left in the first 10 minutes, but then, when we tried to leave that place, THEY LOCKED US UP SO WE COULDN'T LEAVE. it was horrible. Don't go there!)

1mzws1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mzws1s/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Reveal if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Mini Delivers,"**Compact Size, Maximum Convenience**  
The Keurig K-Mini Single Serve Coffee Maker, model K-Mini, has become my go-to solution for small-scale brewing. With its ultra-slim design, it easily tucks away on any counter or table, which is a blessing in my tiny apartment kitchen. At less than 5 inches wide, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more space-efficient coffee maker. Its minimalistic, matte black finish adds a modern touch, blending seamlessly with my kitchen decor. Plus, the compact design isn't just about looks‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for dorms, offices, or anywhere space is limited.

**Simple One-Cup Operation**  
I consider myself a lover of simple appliances‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need flashy touchscreens or overly complicated features, so the straightforward functionality of this product is exactly what I wanted. Brewing coffee with this machine is as easy as adding fresh water to the single-cup reservoir, inserting a K-Cup pod, and pressing a single button. With no unnecessary complexities, it brews a fresh and consistent cup every time. The fact that you can brew any cup size between 6 and 12oz makes it adaptable, whether you‚Äôre craving a strong morning shot or a mellow evening brew.  

[Check Keurig K-Mini price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)  

**Energy-Saving Design Elements**  
I adore how this machine saves me from worrying about wasted electricity. Thanks to its auto-off feature, it shuts down 90 seconds after each brew. This is not only a win for the environment but also for my peace of mind (I‚Äôm notorious for forgetting to turn off appliances). It‚Äôs nice feeling confident that my energy bill won‚Äôt creep up because of a forgotten coffee maker. This energy efficiency is an underrated but awesome feature.  

**Winning Points**  
- Its slim, modern profile is ideal for small spaces.  
- Cord storage keeps everything organized and ready for transport.  
- Removable drip tray accommodates travel mugs, making it versatile.  

**Bad Points**  
- Only brews one cup at a time, which may not suit households with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- Advanced features like temperature control and milk frothing are absent.  
- The water reservoir must be refilled for each brew, which can feel inconvenient on busy mornings.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to slightly larger options like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or even the Keurig K-Slim, this model shines in terms of portability and ease of use. However, it lacks the milk frothing capabilities some competitors offer, so latte lovers may want to explore brands like Breville for more advanced features. If you're strictly looking for a no-frills, single-use coffee maker that fits virtually anywhere, this choice remains unmatched.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Considering its functionality, the pricing is solidly justifiable. It may not boast all the bells and whistles seen on high-end machines, but that‚Äôs not its target demographic anyway. The point is clear‚Äîit meets the needs of space-savvy coffee drinkers and serves them well. It truly delivers value without going overboard in complexity or cost. Whether you‚Äôre furnishing a compact dorm room or adding a backup machine to your office, this coffee maker is a sound investment.

I run a business from home from a laptop, but recently I've been bouncing around working from coffee shops/meeting rooms at my clients' premises/the library etc just to get out of the house, and I'm doing it enough that I've had my eye open for an office for myself. That said, I need nearly no space, so even the smallest possible office for rent around here ends up being hundreds per month once bills are included, for space I just won't use.

A premises has come up for rent at ¬£850/mo that is fairly large at around 950sq/ft. It's in a great location with tonnes of on-street parking and a council carpark right behind it. It's also right on a junction at the major through-route in my town so traffic is constant and the building is extremely visible.

The opportunity here is that this has the potential to be both an office for me, and a co-working space that I can build slowly.

I already turn a profit in my main business, so the co-working business would only have to break even, taking the pressure off straight away.

I have a background in IT and web development, and am fairly certain I can put together a solid tech stack that will allow me to run it mostly unattended.

* Wordpress based website handles booking, memberships and payments.
* UniFi kit for door access control (with all the proper battery backups) and WiFi.
* Managed switches and pfSense/piHoles etc to handle network control (VLANs, speed limits, content filtering etc). Hikvision cameras & screens everywhere for security.
* PaperCut (or something custom) to handle printer credits.
* Any helper plugins or scripts I need to facilitate communication between APIs I can do fairly easily.
* There's also space for a coffee machine, lockers, I'd build a hireable meeting room and a couple of private micro-offices/booths too.

Unless I'm missing something major, I could provide unique time-limited door and WiFi PINs to any day-pass users via email upon payment. Same with meeting rooms. Members would get PINs that are time-limited to much longer, and depending on their membership could be 24/7 access.

Where I live, you go into any coffee shop and there's people sat there on laptops. Our library has just dropped down to 2 days/week and aside from a few business centres that are renting offices, there's nowhere really for people to go to work or study.

I would clean it myself to begin with until I could afford a cleaner.

Initial outlay would be painting, signage, cleaning, a few internal repairs, all the tech and then furniture. My family are all in the trades so electrical, plumbing and building work would be just materials (stud walls, pasterboard etc).

Am I missing something? Seems like as an opportunity, it could be too good to be true, hence my posting here.

To be clear - I don't need to make a profit, I already earn a wage from my main business.

If I only broke even month-on-month, then I basically have a free office that I can use, plus all the connections and marketing that comes with being able to have people through my door.

If I turn a profit, then that can be re-invested into better tech, building an extension (there's room out back), cleaning fees, extra security etc and if it does really well then there is the option of opening more locations as time goes on.

I feel like co-working is growing year on year, seeing more and more places popping up, it feels like it's only a matter of time before they start appearing in smaller towns like mine.

Any insight would be more than appreciated, even negative.

It doesn‚Äôt trap you the way you‚Äôd expect. It lets you leave so you can unravel in the places you think are safe. I thought I escaped. I thought wrong.

------------------------

I opened my eyes and found myself back in the bed within Room 409.

The sheets were tucked like a nurse‚Äôs apology. Sunlight poured in through cracked blinds. Outside‚Äîbirds chirped. Somewhere far away, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through a hallway that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

Everything felt normal ‚Äî which is how I knew it wasn‚Äôt.

The wallpaper didn‚Äôt breathe. The mirror didn‚Äôt whisper. The notebook was gone. The silence was polite.

It felt like a dream trying to pass as a memory.

I stood. My coat hung on the back of a chair‚Äîclean, pressed, unscarred. I slipped it on. It fit too well.

For a fleeting second, I almost believed I was free.

Downstairs, the lobby was quiet. Empty. No mildew. No static hum in the vents.

Just sunlight.

I stepped outside.

The air was sharp and fresh, no longer polluted from the scent of the sky bleeding rain. My car was waiting, and my keys found their way into my hand out of instinct.

The engine purred to life as I drove past blinking stoplights, past kids with backpacks, and shopkeepers sweeping sidewalks. The kind of world where tragedy only lives in newspaper headlines.

It felt like waking up from an unfathomable nightmare.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I wanted all along, to believe this was just a dream.

‚∏ª

At some point during my drive, I decided to stop off at a gas station to use the restroom.

The water swirled red as I washed my hands. Not blood. Something older. Remembrance?

I looked up.

My face smiled back. Rested. Too rested. Like grief had been ironed out of all the pores of my skin.

I forced a smile. The reflection held it longer than I did.

Then‚Äîbehind me:

‚ÄúYou left me.‚Äù

My heart stopped.

I turned.

Empty bathroom stalls. Silent.

Except one was ajar.

Wet, child-sized footprints trailed from the tiles.

Back in the mirror‚Äî

Mr. Grey sat on the counter behind me.

And my reflection?

It didn‚Äôt move.

It just watched me.

Disturbed by what I was experiencing, I left the bathroom in a panic. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore‚Ä¶

‚∏ª

The drive home was uneventful but ephemeral.

I was just happy to be in the outside world again and away from that dreaded place.

I placed the key in lock of the door and noticed that the lights were already on.

My apartment looked rather immaculate. The couch, dishes, and books were all pristine and organized appropriately.

I noticed one particular photo on the wall though; one I was sure I had taken down months ago.

My little girl, holding Mr. Grey.

I turned toward the dining table and noticed that the journal from the hotel was there.

No dust. No reason.

Just resting out in the open, as if it were anticipating my arrival.

I didn‚Äôt touch it, not yet.

My phone buzzed softly as I reached down to grab it.

The screen was lit up with the notification of a new voicemail.

I didn‚Äôt remember calling anyone.

I pressed play and began listening with fearful eagerness.

I heard my voice speaking, but...it also wasn‚Äôt mine.

It was flat, lifeless, eerily mechanical. It was like someone was reading from a script with complete disinterest in the subject matter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home now. It‚Äôs safe here. I‚Äôm better now.‚Äù

I deleted it and thought that was the end.

But then it returned. Same timestamp. Same flat voice. Like it had never left.

As quickly as I deleted these voicemails though, they would appear in my inbox again and again.

No matter how many times I tried to delete it, it would come back.

I eventually chalked up my endeavors as fruitless and walked to the bedroom where a lamp glowed somewhat ominously in the corner.

Blue.

The exact shade she liked.

And beneath the lighting, sitting cross-legged was the girl in the photograph with Mr. Grey.

It was Emily, my little girl‚Ä¶my daughter.

She didn‚Äôt move and she didn‚Äôt blink.

She just sat underneath the glow of the lamp as if she were in a period of stasis.

But when I whispered her name, she looked up.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to go alone,‚Äù she spoke in a hushed tone.

Her voice was purely air, barely more than a faint breath.

I stepped closer, my knees shaking. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt alone, Emily‚Ä¶‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYes, I was‚Ä¶you left me in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to see you suffer anymore honey...‚Äù I whimpered, fighting the tears that threatened to trail down my face.

‚ÄúWhy did you do this?‚Äù

She reached out and touched my fingers.

They were warm‚Ä¶real.

And then as quickly as she appeared‚Ä¶she was gone.

Like she‚Äôd never been there.

The lamp flickered, black and blue pulsating the room briefly before the colors surrendered to the darkness. 

I screamed into the mattress, begging internally for a god that I didn‚Äôt even know existed to release me from this agony.

No sound came out, just a heavy and sustained breath of emotional turmoil.

The weight of everything I never said.

‚∏ª

Things started unraveling the next morning despite the world pretending again.

I brewed my coffee, made some breakfast, and watched TV in the living room.

I did my best to block out the previous day‚Äôs events, but no matter what I did it seemed like my mind constantly gravitated back towards it.

I finished up watching a random program and went to go wash my dirty dishes when I felt like a pair of eyes were upon me.

It felt like I was being watched by someone, or something.

I looked around but didn‚Äôt see anything except the journal, the one from Room 409 on my dining room table.

I walked towards it and noticed that it was open.

It only had one line written across the page:

‚ÄúHow many times will you bury her to protect yourself?‚Äù

I slammed it shut.

The leather felt like melted flesh against my hand as I threw it across the room.

I watched in pure astonishment as it vanished in mid-air.

That was the first of many things that I couldn‚Äôt begin to explain:

‚Ä¢	In the bathroom mirror, I watched myself walk away. Another time I saw my reflection smile when I didn‚Äôt.

‚Ä¢	A girl on the sidewalk whispered, in my daughter‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúI still remember you.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	The sound of peeling wallpaper buzzed behind my teeth.

Most disturbingly though, the journal followed me no matter where I went. I couldn‚Äôt get rid of it either. I would throw it away, tear it apart, set it on fire, but it always came back to me in immaculate condition. 

In the fridge, in the mailbox, in the cabinets‚Ä¶ 

It was always soaked in red ink and each time it reassembled itself, new words would be carved into its pages.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt survive. You split.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wearing your face now.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Room didn‚Äôt trap you. You brought it with you.‚Äù

The words haunted me even behind my eyelids, to the point that I stopped trying to run away or destroy it.

One night, I dropped to the floor beside my bed and reached under it.

The journal was there because of course it would be.

Every page had been written in, but not by my own hand.

By Emily‚Äôs.

Drawings, scribbles, all the stories we never finished. Things she might‚Äôve whispered to me if she had more time to.

My eyes fell upon the words inscribed on the final page:

‚ÄúYou thought healing meant pretending but healing means feeling. And you won‚Äôt let yourself.‚Äù

Her scent suddenly infiltrated my nostrils. Shampoo. Baby powder. The hallway after bath time.

Three knocks slowly reverberated throughout the room.  

Not from the door, but from inside the closet.

I turned. I already knew it was waiting.

I opened the door and the dark inside breathed out.

The closet wasn‚Äôt a closet.

It never had been.

It was an invitation shaped like absence.

I stepped inside and the dark swallowed my vision.

Hands brushed old coats, cardboard boxes. For a second, I thought maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI‚Äôd imagined it all.

Then the floor shifted.

Not in weight, but in memory.

‚∏ª

Suddenly, I found myself in a hallway.

It wasn‚Äôt mine nor the hotel‚Äôs.

It was‚Ä¶somewhere between.

The carpet was the color of faded red, like wine was spilt violently onto it. The wallpaper was a vine-green and seemed to sprawl endlessly. 

My ex-wife Claire picked it once, before we knew what kind of grief waited in the walls.

The hallway stretched in both directions ‚Äì unending, dream-warped. It was infinite but familiar, like grief that forgot where it began.

There was no closet behind me.

No apartment.

Only this place.

I reached out and traced my fingers slowly along the wall. It pulsed‚Äîlike it remembered me.

In the wallpaper: faint etchings, a child‚Äôs drawing, a hospital wristband.

A courtroom door?

This wasn‚Äôt a hallway, it was a map.

A map comprised of everything I‚Äôd refused to remember.

‚∏ª

Doors lined the hallway like soldiers waiting to take orders.

They bore no numbers, only marks and symbols of various kinds.

A handprint. 

A burn. 

A crayon sun.

I opened the first door and stepped into Emily‚Äôs room.

Not a version of it.

It was her room, exactly how it had been.

And standing in the corner, in her unicorn pajamas‚Ä¶was Emily.

She didn‚Äôt look up. Instead, she just moved her thumbs like she was texting someone far away.

‚ÄúSweetheart?‚Äù I cautiously inched towards her, uncertain of what could potentially transpire.

She didn‚Äôt answer but rather kept moving her thumbs.

I stepped closer, the air thickening like a blanket of sorrow wrapping itself against my skin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù The apology leaving me like a gasp. ‚ÄúI never stopped missing you. I just didn‚Äôt know how to carry it.‚Äù

She looked up with tired, bloodshot eyes.

They weren‚Äôt angry, but rather glassy with disappointment.

‚ÄúYou left me in the Room.‚Äù She murmured with child-like sadness.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI waited.‚Äù

Her interruption made my blood turn to ice. She had never been that way with me before.

I reached out for her, but she evaporated like a mist.

I was left stupefied, nothing but the air and silence to offer me comfort.

The door to the room was gone now too.

Only the walls remained now.

For a moment, I knew how Fortunato felt - walled in, forgotten, sealed behind silence.

‚∏ª

Eventually, the door to the room manifested itself again.

I opened it and I began walking down the hallway to navigate my way out of this hellscape I found myself in.

Door after door appeared, what awaited me on the other side was emotionally heavier than the last.

An empty hospital corridor that felt cold like a morgue.

Claire crying in a car, her body shuddering violently with grief.

My mother‚Äôs silence when I told her the machines were being turned off.

The Room was a map with each grief serving as a landmark.

Each memory was a trapdoor.

And it kept building out of me, like vines on an abandoned structure.

I stepped through the last door, the hallway‚Äôs shape already forgetting itself behind me. Its impermanence pressing down like a weight I couldn‚Äôt carry.

Home awaited me on the other side.

Sunlight beamed through the kitchen windows as I was greeted with the faint smell of toast and coffee.

As I was walking around the kitchen, my phone buzzed.

A notification revealed that I had received a message from Marla:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slipping again. The Room‚Äôs getting in.‚Äù

How could she have contacted me? I wasn‚Äôt sure she even existed.

The message disappeared seconds later and was instead replaced by:

‚ÄúCome back before it keeps more of you.‚Äù

I placed my phone back in my pocket, my eyes falling upon the journal that waited nearby on the table.

It was open and in Claire‚Äôs own handwriting it said:

‚ÄúYou loved us. But you hated what it made you feel. You buried her so deep, you forgot where you left her. That‚Äôs why it can follow you. Because part of you never left that room.‚Äù

Below that, smaller ink:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ghosts. You are.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Later, I walked to the park in an attempt to clear my head.

The sun was warm; the sound of children‚Äôs laughter and swings creaking filled the air.

It almost felt real.

Almost.

Until‚Äî

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

I turned.

Emily was standing near the swings with the other kids.

She was alive and smiling.

Not spectral. Not wrong.

Just‚Ä¶ her.

I approached, a smile finally making an appearance. ‚ÄúEmily?‚Äù

She softly nodded. Behind her, every swing creaked ‚Äì perfectly, in unison.

The other kids were gone.

The sky blinked in almost strobe light effect like it was forgetting how to hold its shape.

The grass warped until it found its identity again as‚Ä¶the hotel carpet?

The tree bark twisted into plaster.

The world morphed and reality seemed to break all laws of known physics known to man.

As everything began to settle, I realized I was back in Room 409.

It was as if I‚Äôd never left.

‚∏ª

The journal was on the desk again.

But this time, the words weren‚Äôt written.

They were spoken ‚Äî Claire‚Äôs voice rising from the pages like breath fogging glass:

‚ÄúYou keep trying to go forward with parts of you missing. But the Room doesn‚Äôt forget. It keeps what you try to leave behind.‚Äù

I looked in the mirror.

I was asleep.

Even though I was awake.

My reflection breathed. I didn‚Äôt.

It blinked.

I didn‚Äôt.

Behind me‚Äî

The closet creaked open, looking more like a casket than an invitation.

The Room let me run. But it knew I‚Äôd built it myself.

It wasn‚Äôt done with me‚Ä¶because I never stopped needing it.

Room 409 doesn‚Äôt keep you‚Ä¶it becomes you.",3,1756142503.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

The hallway stretched in both directions ‚Äì unending, dream-warped. It was infinite but familiar, like grief that forgot where it began.

There was no closet behind me.

No apartment.

Only this place.

I reached out and traced my fingers slowly along the wall. It pulsed‚Äîlike it remembered me.

In the wallpaper: faint etchings, a child‚Äôs drawing, a hospital wristband.

A courtroom door?

This wasn‚Äôt a hallway, it was a map.

A map comprised of everything I‚Äôd refused to remember.

‚∏ª

Doors lined the hallway like soldiers waiting to take orders.

They bore no numbers, only marks and symbols of various kinds.

A handprint. 

A burn. 

A crayon sun.

I opened the first door and stepped into Emily‚Äôs room.

Not a version of it.

It was her room, exactly how it had been.

And standing in the corner, in her unicorn pajamas‚Ä¶was Emily.

She didn‚Äôt look up. Instead, she just moved her thumbs like she was texting someone far away.

‚ÄúSweetheart?‚Äù I cautiously inched towards her, uncertain of what could potentially transpire.

She didn‚Äôt answer but rather kept moving her thumbs.

I stepped closer, the air thickening like a blanket of sorrow wrapping itself against my skin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù The apology leaving me like a gasp. ‚ÄúI never stopped missing you. I just didn‚Äôt know how to carry it.‚Äù

She looked up with tired, bloodshot eyes.

They weren‚Äôt angry, but rather glassy with disappointment.

‚ÄúYou left me in the Room.‚Äù She murmured with child-like sadness.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI waited.‚Äù

Her interruption made my blood turn to ice. She had never been that way with me before.

I reached out for her, but she evaporated like a mist.

I was left stupefied, nothing but the air and silence to offer me comfort.

The door to the room was gone now too.

Only the walls remained now.

For a moment, I knew how Fortunato felt - walled in, forgotten, sealed behind silence.

‚∏ª

Eventually, the door to the room manifested itself again.

I opened it and I began walking down the hallway to navigate my way out of this hellscape I found myself in.

Door after door appeared, what awaited me on the other side was emotionally heavier than the last.

An empty hospital corridor that felt cold like a morgue.

Claire crying in a car, her body shuddering violently with grief.

My mother‚Äôs silence when I told her the machines were being turned off.

The Room was a map with each grief serving as a landmark.

Each memory was a trapdoor.

And it kept building out of me, like vines on an abandoned structure.

I stepped through the last door, the hallway‚Äôs shape already forgetting itself behind me. Its impermanence pressing down like a weight I couldn‚Äôt carry.

Home awaited me on the other side.

Sunlight beamed through the kitchen windows as I was greeted with the faint smell of toast and coffee.

As I was walking around the kitchen, my phone buzzed.

A notification revealed that I had received a message from Marla:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slipping again. The Room‚Äôs getting in.‚Äù

How could she have contacted me? I wasn‚Äôt sure she even existed.

The message disappeared seconds later and was instead replaced by:

‚ÄúCome back before it keeps more of you.‚Äù

I placed my phone back in my pocket, my eyes falling upon the journal that waited nearby on the table.

It was open and in Claire‚Äôs own handwriting it said:

‚ÄúYou loved us. But you hated what it made you feel. You buried her so deep, you forgot where you left her. That‚Äôs why it can follow you. Because part of you never left that room.‚Äù

Below that, smaller ink:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ghosts. You are.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Later, I walked to the park in an attempt to clear my head.

The sun was warm; the sound of children‚Äôs laughter and swings creaking filled the air.

It almost felt real.

Almost.

Until‚Äî

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

I turned.

Emily was standing near the swings with the other kids.

She was alive and smiling.

Not spectral. Not wrong.

Just‚Ä¶ her.

I approached, a smile finally making an appearance. ‚ÄúEmily?‚Äù

She softly nodded. Behind her, every swing creaked ‚Äì perfectly, in unison.

The other kids were gone.

The sky blinked in almost strobe light effect like it was forgetting how to hold its shape.

The grass warped until it found its identity again as‚Ä¶the hotel carpet?

The tree bark twisted into plaster.

The world morphed and reality seemed to break all laws of known physics known to man.

As everything began to settle, I realized I was back in Room 409.

It was as if I‚Äôd never left.

‚∏ª

The journal was on the desk again.

But this time, the words weren‚Äôt written.

They were spoken ‚Äî Claire‚Äôs voice rising from the pages like breath fogging glass:

‚ÄúYou keep trying to go forward with parts of you missing. But the Room doesn‚Äôt forget. It keeps what you try to leave behind.‚Äù

I looked in the mirror.

I was asleep.

Even though I was awake.

My reflection breathed. I didn‚Äôt.

It blinked.

I didn‚Äôt.

Behind me‚Äî

The closet creaked open, looking more like a casket than an invitation.

The Room let me run. But it knew I‚Äôd built it myself.

It wasn‚Äôt done with me‚Ä¶because I never stopped needing it.

It doesn‚Äôt trap you the way you‚Äôd expect. It lets you leave so you can unravel in the places you think are safe. I thought I escaped. I thought wrong.

------------------------

I opened my eyes and found myself back in the bed within Room 409.

The sheets were tucked like a nurse‚Äôs apology. Sunlight poured in through cracked blinds. Outside‚Äîbirds chirped. Somewhere far away, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through a hallway that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

Everything felt normal ‚Äî which is how I knew it wasn‚Äôt.

The wallpaper didn‚Äôt breathe. The mirror didn‚Äôt whisper. The notebook was gone. The silence was polite.

It felt like a dream trying to pass as a memory.

I stood. My coat hung on the back of a chair‚Äîclean, pressed, unscarred. I slipped it on. It fit too well.

For a fleeting second, I almost believed I was free.

Downstairs, the lobby was quiet. Empty. No mildew. No static hum in the vents.

Just sunlight.

I stepped outside.

The air was sharp and fresh, no longer polluted from the scent of the sky bleeding rain. My car was waiting, and my keys found their way into my hand out of instinct.

The engine purred to life as I drove past blinking stoplights, past kids with backpacks, and shopkeepers sweeping sidewalks. The kind of world where tragedy only lives in newspaper headlines.

It felt like waking up from an unfathomable nightmare.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I wanted all along, to believe this was just a dream.

‚∏ª

At some point during my drive, I decided to stop off at a gas station to use the restroom.

The water swirled red as I washed my hands. Not blood. Something older. Remembrance?

I looked up.

My face smiled back. Rested. Too rested. Like grief had been ironed out of all the pores of my skin.

I forced a smile. The reflection held it longer than I did.

Then‚Äîbehind me:

‚ÄúYou left me.‚Äù

My heart stopped.

I turned.

Empty bathroom stalls. Silent.

Except one was ajar.

Wet, child-sized footprints trailed from the tiles.

Back in the mirror‚Äî

Mr. Grey sat on the counter behind me.

And my reflection?

It didn‚Äôt move.

It just watched me.

Disturbed by what I was experiencing, I left the bathroom in a panic. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore‚Ä¶

‚∏ª

The drive home was uneventful but ephemeral.

I was just happy to be in the outside world again and away from that dreaded place.

I placed the key in lock of the door and noticed that the lights were already on.

My apartment looked rather immaculate. The couch, dishes, and books were all pristine and organized appropriately.

I noticed one particular photo on the wall though; one I was sure I had taken down months ago.

My little girl, holding Mr. Grey.

I turned toward the dining table and noticed that the journal from the hotel was there.

No dust. No reason.

Just resting out in the open, as if it were anticipating my arrival.

I didn‚Äôt touch it, not yet.

My phone buzzed softly as I reached down to grab it.

The screen was lit up with the notification of a new voicemail.

I didn‚Äôt remember calling anyone.

I pressed play and began listening with fearful eagerness.

I heard my voice speaking, but...it also wasn‚Äôt mine.

It was flat, lifeless, eerily mechanical. It was like someone was reading from a script with complete disinterest in the subject matter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home now. It‚Äôs safe here. I‚Äôm better now.‚Äù

I deleted it and thought that was the end.

But then it returned. Same timestamp. Same flat voice. Like it had never left.

As quickly as I deleted these voicemails though, they would appear in my inbox again and again.

No matter how many times I tried to delete it, it would come back.

I eventually chalked up my endeavors as fruitless and walked to the bedroom where a lamp glowed somewhat ominously in the corner.

Blue.

The exact shade she liked.

And beneath the lighting, sitting cross-legged was the girl in the photograph with Mr. Grey.

It was Emily, my little girl‚Ä¶my daughter.

She didn‚Äôt move and she didn‚Äôt blink.

She just sat underneath the glow of the lamp as if she were in a period of stasis.

But when I whispered her name, she looked up.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to go alone,‚Äù she spoke in a hushed tone.

Her voice was purely air, barely more than a faint breath.

I stepped closer, my knees shaking. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt alone, Emily‚Ä¶‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúYes, I was‚Ä¶you left me in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to see you suffer anymore honey...‚Äù I whimpered, fighting the tears that threatened to trail down my face.

‚ÄúWhy did you do this?‚Äù

She reached out and touched my fingers.

They were warm‚Ä¶real.

And then as quickly as she appeared‚Ä¶she was gone.

Like she‚Äôd never been there.

The lamp flickered, black and blue pulsating the room briefly before the colors surrendered to the darkness. 

I screamed into the mattress, begging internally for a god that I didn‚Äôt even know existed to release me from this agony.

No sound came out, just a heavy and sustained breath of emotional turmoil.

The weight of everything I never said.

‚∏ª

Things started unraveling the next morning despite the world pretending again.

I brewed my coffee, made some breakfast, and watched TV in the living room.

I did my best to block out the previous day‚Äôs events, but no matter what I did it seemed like my mind constantly gravitated back towards it.

I finished up watching a random program and went to go wash my dirty dishes when I felt like a pair of eyes were upon me.

It felt like I was being watched by someone, or something.

I looked around but didn‚Äôt see anything except the journal, the one from Room 409 on my dining room table.

I walked towards it and noticed that it was open.

It only had one line written across the page:

‚ÄúHow many times will you bury her to protect yourself?‚Äù

I slammed it shut.

The leather felt like melted flesh against my hand as I threw it across the room.

I watched in pure astonishment as it vanished in mid-air.

That was the first of many things that I couldn‚Äôt begin to explain:

‚Ä¢	In the bathroom mirror, I watched myself walk away. Another time I saw my reflection smile when I didn‚Äôt.

‚Ä¢	A girl on the sidewalk whispered, in my daughter‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúI still remember you.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	The sound of peeling wallpaper buzzed behind my teeth.

Most disturbingly though, the journal followed me no matter where I went. I couldn‚Äôt get rid of it either. I would throw it away, tear it apart, set it on fire, but it always came back to me in immaculate condition. 

In the fridge, in the mailbox, in the cabinets‚Ä¶ 

It was always soaked in red ink and each time it reassembled itself, new words would be carved into its pages.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt survive. You split.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wearing your face now.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Room didn‚Äôt trap you. You brought it with you.‚Äù

The words haunted me even behind my eyelids, to the point that I stopped trying to run away or destroy it.

One night, I dropped to the floor beside my bed and reached under it.

The journal was there because of course it would be.

Every page had been written in, but not by my own hand.

By Emily‚Äôs.

Drawings, scribbles, all the stories we never finished. Things she might‚Äôve whispered to me if she had more time to.

My eyes fell upon the words inscribed on the final page:

‚ÄúYou thought healing meant pretending but healing means feeling. And you won‚Äôt let yourself.‚Äù

Her scent suddenly infiltrated my nostrils. Shampoo. Baby powder. The hallway after bath time.

Three knocks slowly reverberated throughout the room.  

Not from the door, but from inside the closet.

I turned. I already knew it was waiting.

I opened the door and the dark inside breathed out.

The closet wasn‚Äôt a closet.

It never had been.

It was an invitation shaped like absence.

I stepped inside and the dark swallowed my vision.

Hands brushed old coats, cardboard boxes. For a second, I thought maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI‚Äôd imagined it all.

Then the floor shifted.

Not in weight, but in memory.

‚∏ª

Suddenly, I found myself in a hallway.

It wasn‚Äôt mine nor the hotel‚Äôs.

It was‚Ä¶somewhere between.

The carpet was the color of faded red, like wine was spilt violently onto it. The wallpaper was a vine-green and seemed to sprawl endlessly. 

My ex-wife Claire picked it once, before we knew what kind of grief waited in the walls.

The hallway stretched in both directions ‚Äì unending, dream-warped. It was infinite but familiar, like grief that forgot where it began.

I unintentionally took a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù to figure out what I wanted to study in college, get a job, etc. Really I just kept putting off college because I don‚Äôt care for it. Maybe that sounds bad but the only reason I consider it is because I do love learning and I feel embarrassed telling people I do not attend college. I ended up becoming severely depressed because of the amount of time I‚Äôve spent at home with my toxic family, losing interest in all of my hobbies and not able to explore my interests. I‚Äôm back at square one: knowing exactly what I want to do as I did when I was 16, 17, 18‚Ä¶ I want to open up my own coffee shop or something similar. I have always had a strong passion for baking and coffee and the thought of building something of my own is so exciting and motivating to me. I want to build a community and a brand. I always struggled in school not because I wasn‚Äôt smart but because I have terrible ADHD, and I am not motivated by a degree like my peers are.

Some things to consider are that I come from no money, so my college would be almost free, and opening a physical business now is not possible but social media and local selling is a great opportunity so I know I could start that way. My family has made me doubt myself. I am desperate to get out of my house ASAP, but even if I went to college it would be locally for the first two years. If I went to college and got a degree I still would not get a 9-5 job, I am just wondering if I should go to gain a further education. 

One part of me wants to take the more comfortable route to go to college, get a degree, and then wait until then to try to start the business. But the other part of me feels dreadful towards college, and thinks why wait when I‚Äôm so passionate now.

The only reason I haven‚Äôt gone full in is because I am scared of committing to something while I am being told I have all these other options. I also had other interests, film and english. If i went to college I‚Äôd be on track to go to a college that has a great film school. But as much as I love these others interests, opening my own business is the one that really ignites me and will allow me more financial prosperity in the future. If i do pursue my business now I plan to take it very seriously. As much as I love the idea of following my passions I also am very serious about having the lifestyle I desire and financial prosperity, It‚Äôs not just about being happy for me. 

I know I need money to start. I have an assistant job and am thinking of getting a serving job, but if I don‚Äôt go to college I can also start selling my baked goods and stuff now.

Basically, what should I do? Get a Job and do college and forget about my business until later or just go all in? Or should I do school and try to start my business at once (sounds extremely overwhelming considering I‚Äôd be working on top of that as well)? What would you do in my situation? Any type of advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.",1,1756142232.0,findapath,2,1.0,False

1.	I applied late to the MA History program (August 12) because I had not initially planned to study in Belgium; my other options fell through due to lack of scholarships which meant I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to attend. My application is still being processed and the last update i got was a email on Aug 19 saying ‚Äúcredential evaluators are examining the authenticity and content of the academic diplomas and transcripts‚Äù. does anyone know how much longer it might take? If it takes too long, I may not have enough time to obtain a visa by the late arrival deadline of October 3. The program coordinator mentioned: ‚ÄúIn case you are admitted, we ask you to (re)consider enrolling (and, for instance, postpone it to the next academic year) if you notice that your arrival will be delayed even more. We hope this advice is helpful. Please do not hesitate if we can clarify anything else.‚Äù However, I thought KU Leuven doesn‚Äôt allow deferrals, so I‚Äôm unsure how to interpret this.


2.	Would it be possible to find part-time work in Leuven (e.g., fast food, coffee shops, or stores) speaking only English? Does the university offer any part-time job opportunities for students?

He is also a surgeon so maybe someone could use that to attract more matches. But we met on Tinder last year in the spring. He didn't use his real name, but a random word. Let's say that random word was Night.

So this account I found has the same few photos he had last year when we met but also 2 brand new that I know are knew because I took them 2 months ago. He has the same nickname Night. The profile is verified! (my friend said that its entirely possible to verify a profile, then delete all pics and put fake ones of the person you have stolen them from. but still...). Some details are not the same as they were last year. But the hobbies he listed are the same, he is half French and the favourite song he put there (spotify connected) was a French song. He listens to French music a lot, but I don't remember this one. The age is hidden though. Which I know is a paid feature, to hide your age.

My cousin found the profile

Is there an chance it isn't him? I mean he is a good looking guy but nothing out of ordinary. If I would want to scam someone using a surgeon profile I would choose more professional pics. One of the pics there was a selfie (he has that selfie on facebook too though, so maybe someone stole it). But its the kind where in background one can see food, half empty coffee mug and its not a flattering pic. Please tell me its not him.",1,1756142131.0,TrueOffMyChest,7,0.6,False

But then they cite certain behaviors like drinking black Mr. Coffee and such, so more specifically a Japanese Teenager?

Then I see some Anime which portrays chuunibyou as somewhat delusional, wearing an eye patch, and associating with otherworldly powers... so a delusional Japanese teenage fantasy cosplayer? Since that would include most of an Anime Expo, I would add, one who does this in real life when there is no cosplay event going on?

In fact, is chuunibyou a real thing or an Anime Trope, like pirate, Isekai, school idol group, reincarnated slime, etc...? Because at least growing up, I don't actually recall seeing any in real life, I mean I myself did pretend to be Starscream every chance I could get because around ages 9-12 I really wanted to be a Transformer, but of course grew out of it by teenage years, and didn't see anyone else do that (this would be the Anime depiction of chuunibyou), because everyone was trying hard to be cool and NOT look like he might have played with Transformers at one point (which ironically would be closer to the YouTube explanation of chuunibyou - acting grown up). But if that's all it means then that covers every single child because, at least AFAIK, everyone wanted to be something when they were a child, and everyone wanted to grow up when they were a teen. So that would mean that chuunibyou is an Anima thing then, about as real as stretchy pirates and people randomly falling out of the sky?

Okay perhaps except in the rare cases of severe trauma or PTSD or genuine psychosis but I don't seem to get the feeling that the term was being used to describe an actual medical condition.

1mzwgpi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzwgpi,Review: Four Seasons Oahu at Ko Olina,"Recently got back from an 8 night stay at the FS Ko Olina with my husband and our 5 1/2 year old son and wanted to share my thoughts since joining this community helped me with figuring out where to stay! We booked through the awesome u/alex_travels which was my first time ever booking with a TA and a total game changer in terms of the perks.

It was also only my second time to Hawaii but first time on Oahu (first Hawaii trip was our babymoon to Maui 6 years ago where we stayed at the incredible Hotel Wailea--would have gone back in a heartbeat but it's adults only, ha!) I didn't think I'd find someplace to love more than Wailea, but some of the natural beauty on Oahu really took my breath away.

In regards to the hotel--I'll split this review into the great, the good and the room for improvement. Overall, we had a really nice stay, but we did experience some consistent communication/logistical issues that kept the experience from feeling like the flawless, five-star service the Four Seasons is supposed to be known for. But at the end of the day, we got to spend 8 days in paradise and in the grand scheme of things, I know we'll look back fondly on this trip as a whole.

**TL;DR** \-  A beautiful family-friendly resort that does alot of things really well, but fell a bit short of our expectations from a communications/service standpoint. I actually would highly recommend this hotel for a family with young kids because you'll make some great memories here, I'm just a bit torn though on if I'd stay here again in the future.

**Great**

**Booking Through Alex:** The best decision we made was booking through Alex! Not only did her status as an FSPP get us free breakfast every morning (which was a significant cost benefit considering we were there for 8 nights), but we were also thrilled at check-in to hear our room had been upgraded (from a resort room to partial-ocean view, SO nice!!) When we got to our room, there was a sweet note from Alex and a really yummy cupcake. 

When we had a few communication issues related to some other things that first day (I'll discuss in more detail further down), I messaged Alex and literally within 10 minutes, our room phone rang with someone from the concierge team checking in on us and apologizing for those small mishaps. It felt good knowing Alex had our back--felt seriously so lucky we happened across this ChubbyTravel group and her!

**Hotel/Hotel Grounds:** I think the location and the hotel grounds were really beautiful and well kept. We were thrilled with our complimentary room upgrade and really enjoyed the view from our balcony. We really enjoyed being right on the beach and had fun at the various pools (the Family pool, Kid's Pool and the adults-only pool). We didn't get a chance to check out the spa/fitness center pool. The hotel is incredibly kid friendly and it shows with the type of travelers that stayed here with young children (like us!)

**Camp Kohola (Kid's Club):** Phenomenal staff, a great, huge space for the kids and fun programming each day. Our son had an absolute blast and my husband and I were able to spend some time at the adult pool, which was a total win-win!

**Spa:** The spa is a stunning space, and the team there was incredibly welcoming. I had fantastic treatments from both Santi (Lomilomi massage) and Mei-Ling (Mauka & Makai Ritual).

**Noe Restaurant:** The mushroom truffle pasta is to die for! We went twice during our trip and had the same server, Kyle, both times. He was so great--warm, friendly super attentive and remembered us and our son's dairy allergy.

**Adult Pool:** The view from the infinity pool was spectacular and the servers were great! It was never a problem for us to get a spot and in the afternoon they would come around every once in awhile with complimentary mini samples of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as light bites.

**Complimentary House Car:** You can request for drop-off and pick-up within Ko Olina, which we used twice during our stay. The cars are nice and comfy and the drivers were super friendly.

**Good**

**Location:** I know some people don't like how kind of remote and small the town of Ko Olina is, but we really enjoyed that aspect of our stay. We live in a pretty bustling city, so the quiet of the surrounding area is exactly what we were looking for on our vacation, plus the location was actually really great in terms of the off-site excursions we did--we rented a Jeep through the hotel one day to drive to the east side to visit Kualoa Ranch and another day we rented a Jeep again to drive to the North Shore to visit Waimea Valley--both were easy drives from the hotel.

As for being next door to Aulani--I was worried that the beach would be super crowded, but the hotels do a good job of splitting the beach sections (thank goodness!).

**Breakfast Buffet @ La Hiki:** I'm not usually the biggest fan of buffets, but I thought they did a really good job of having some variety each day, so that eating there 8 mornings in a row didn't feel like we were eating the same things over and over again (unless we chose to do so).

**Four Seasons Chat App**: It was really helpful being able to ask questions and make requests through the app, right from my phone. For the most part, it worked out pretty well.

**Room for Improvement**

With all the good experiences above, we unfortunately experienced some consistent communication issues that did somewhat negatively impact our stay--it was my first time staying at a Four Seasons and I felt a little letdown. 

We had arranged for a few toys to be in our room for our son, which was confirmed via email two weeks before our stay. They weren't there upon arrival, so when I mentioned it to the concierge who called our room to check in on us, she was incredibly apologetic and went above and beyond to make it right. The toy basket and kids' tent she had set up for him while we were out to dinner was such a sweet and unexpected surprise. If this had been the only communication issue, it totally would have been fine since they went out of their way to make it right, but unfortunately this was just the first of several communication and service issues we experienced that just weren't up to par.

Also on the first day, we noticed the outlets built into the dresser near my side of the bed weren't working, nor was one of the dimming lights on my husband's side of the bed working. They said they sent someone to fix it while we were out to dinner and sent me a note in the chat app that the engineer said it was fixed, but they still weren't working when we got back. I texted through the app to have someone come again in the morning and they said they would send someone at 9:15am.¬†

I waited in the room to show them the problem while my husband and son headed to the beach, but after nearly 30 minutes and a follow-up message, no one arrived. It was frustrating to have to spend part of my first full day of vacation waiting around for a repair. Not wanting to waste any more time, I just left handwritten notes detailing the issues and headed to the beach to meet up with family. Everything was finally fixed when we got back to the room and to their credit, they left a kind, handwritten note and a cute chocolate bar shaped like pliers. Again, sweet gesture, but frustrating process.

There were a few other small communication issues that continued to happen throughout the week (like discussing our son's dairy allergy with our server at Mina's Fish House and then her immediately asking if we wanted her to bring the yogurt dip with his bread...no, he has a dairy allergy!), ordering room service through the Four Seasons app where we asked for rice as a side, but got potatoes instead, etc.).

But the most dramatic thing that ended up happening was at breakfast one morning when a server accidentally spilled coffee on me. Both the server and a manager apologized¬†profusely and kindly offered to launder my stained clothing and my stained white sneakers (I guess I was lucky it was iced and not hot!). I know accidents happen and I actually wasn't upset, just a little stunned to be covered in coffee lol.

At the end of our trip at check out, what did shock me though was seeing a double charge for what was supposed to be complimentary laundry service on our final bill. Tiffany at the front desk was fantastic and removed it immediately, but the error of it appearing on the bill (not once, but twice!) itself speaks to the logistical/communication gaps we experienced throughout the week.

Hope this was helpful! As I mentioned above, I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for a good place to stay with young kids--it really checks a lot of boxes for an ideal family vacation. Hopefully the issues we experienced were just a fluke.

This is my first post on this subreddit, but I was waiting to have my score in hand before I write one.

Now that i'm done with the GRE (unofficial 324 - 162Q, 162V), I feel that I'm ready to apply for good MBA programs outside of the US and Canada. A few details about me which I think would be relevant for your kind suggestions/advice:

1. Nationality: Indian (27 year-old female)  
2. Undergrad: BA Economics (Honors) from Christ University, Bangalore (3.67 / 4 GPA)  
3. Industries: Finance & Investment Ops (4 yrs) > HR tech startup (7 months) > Fintech startup (6 months, ongoing)  
4. Work Experience: 4 years with JP Morgan India in Asset Management > 6 month break to prep for GMAT (595 score) > 1.5 years at two startups  
5. Current Designation: Founder's Office at an early-stage 0-1 fintech based in India, primarily leading 0-1 GTM + marketing & branding + SEO/GEO + bit of compliance & internal ops + B2B sales & partnerships  
6. Key Work Wins: 1 promotion in JPM, Employee of the year award + other notable ones  
7. Thought behind MBA: Want more structure to my functional niche + income growth + go back to a bigger org   
8. Post MBA Goal: Consulting (want to relocate and work for min. 5-7 years outside India)  
9. Desired Geographies: Europe (IESE, IMD, Esade, INSEAD), Asia (HKUST, NUS), Australia, Germany, Denmark maybe  
10. International Exposure: Never traveled abroad, worked with onshore teams during JPM stint

What I'm Looking For From This Post/Community:  
\- what MBA programs & colleges can I target with this profile?  
\- are there any other fitting MBA alternatives I can look at to achieve these goals, like a Mfin, MiM, etc. (although I feel that neither of these give you the same level of finality as MBA from an academic pov)  
\- what's the job/employment scene like now, which geography is OK with indians coming in and working peacefully? one of the reasons i'm not even entertaining US/Canada/Ireland is because of all the horrible stuff i've heard from my friends/in the news about how indians are treated in these regions

I walk past cafes and they are just part of the landscape not inclination to go in, all around me people drink energy drinks and coffee and i'm indifferent to it.

You don't even consider how the majority of people around you are consuming caffeine in some capacity, it doesn't even cross your mind. Life is just normal without it, no urge to return, no curiosity in returning, I wake up and feel fine go about my day.

It's kind of funny that the process of this starts thinking it's going to be some massive thing for years to come, a life changing moment. It's not, you return to a new normal and don't look back and that's the best part about it",11,1756141736.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Some notes:

1) Last time I was here (5 ish years ago) they didn‚Äôt have any male clothes, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs only female clothes again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

2) Everything is at least 50% off, and can go up to 90% off. When I was there 5+ years ago, there were tops for like $15 and pants for $25. It‚Äôs SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than buying it at regular or even sale price. I wouldn‚Äôt be lining up for it if I didn‚Äôt think it was worth it. Which brings me to my next point.

3) Expect a lineup going in. My sister said it‚Äôs a lot worse in the early morning and tends to get better through out the day. 

3) Dress light! The change rooms are communal and it gets messy in there. I‚Äôm going to wear some biker shorts and a tank top so I can just try on the clothes over top of them in the aisles.

4) No pressure to stay together once we get inside. It really does get hectic in there. If anyone wants to socialize after, I‚Äôm open to grabbing some food or a coffee and chat for a bit, otherwise just feel free to head on home.

She's a very kind, sweet friend. She's also a very pretty asian girl who gets quite a bit of attention from men.

The only day/time she was able to fly in, I would be wrapping up an important on-site work event. But my husband \[35M\] was on PTO that day, so I asked Lana if she'd be ok with him picking her up at the airport and bringing her back to our house. She'd just have to wait for \~1.5 hours with my husband and dog while I finished up work.¬†

Husband agreed, and Lana was grateful.

When I finally got home, Lana and I were going to get some drinks and catch up at this cute little speakeasy¬†near my house. She told me she had the *best* review of my husband to give me.¬†

I asked, what did he do?

She said he was *such* a gentleman. When he picked her up at the airport, he immediately got out of the car, took her luggage from her, opened her passenger door, told her to get in, made sure she was comfortable, closed her door for her, *then* he took her luggage back to the trunk and loaded it.

She said, by comparison, when her boyfriend picks her up at the airport, he just pops the trunk when he sees her walking up.

When she got in the car, she realized he had gotten her Starbucks. She told him that's so sweet, he didn't have to do that. He told her it was no problem, he figured she might want some coffee after such a long flight.

But the drink he had gotten her was a flat white, which is her favorite drink (she's been obsessed with them since college). She asked him, ""How did you know I like this?? Did your wife tell you?""

He said he remembered she had mentioned liking them once at a dinner we were all at 3 years ago.

When they got home, he asked her if she was hungry. She said she was very hungry, but would grab something to-go later when I got back.

He said nonsense and offered to make her something. She said, ""please no, I don't want to trouble you, I can eat later!"" He asked her what she would pick up later? She said pasta. He said, I can make pasta right now and went into the kitchen.

He made her homemade red sauce¬†pasta and served it to her. (She said it was delicious.) He asked if she wanted a glass of sangria and poured it for her. He then also gave her a cherry dr pepper zero without asking. We have basically every flavor of zero soda in our fridge, but that is her favorite. She didn't ask how he knew that (or if it was a coincidence), and I'm not sure either.

She said I did well, and he's one of the good ones! A+

He does cook for me sometimes when planned and does nice things, and he is a nice guy overall. This just seems, kind of, IDK romantic.

1mzw7st,https://www.catkittyfood.com/how-to-rid-ear-mites-in-cats-2/,How To Rid Ear Mites In Cats,"**How To Rid Ear Mites In Cats**

Ear mites in cats can cause significant discomfort and irritation. To effectively address this issue, understanding how to rid ear mites in cats is crucial. These tiny parasites thrive in the ear canal and can lead to serious health concerns if left untreated.

Firstly, the symptoms of ear mites in cats typically include excessive scratching at the ears, shaking of the head, and discharge that may resemble coffee grounds. Identifying these signs early can expedite treatment and alleviate discomfort for your feline friend.

To rid your cat of ear mites, follow these steps:


Visit the Veterinarian: A vet can confirm the presence of ear mites through a simple examination and may provide a prescription treatment tailored to your cat‚Äôs needs.
Administer Medication: Over-the-counter solutions and vet-prescribed treatments such as topical medications, ear drops, or systemic treatments can effectively eradicate ear mites. Always follow the vet's guidelines for usage.
Clean the Ears: Regularly cleaning your cat's ears with a veterinary-recommended cleaner can help remove debris and alleviate irritation. Use a cotton ball or soft cloth to gently clean the outer ear without inserting anything deep into the canal.
Treat the Environment: Since ear mites can survive in the environment, it‚Äôs essential to clean your home. Wash bedding, vacuum carpets, and consider using a mite-specific household spray to eliminate any lingering mites.


Preventative care is vital in keeping ear mites at bay. Regular vet check-ups and maintaining good hygiene can significantly reduce the risk of infestation. Knowing how to rid ear mites in cats ensures a comfortable and healthy life for your pet.

The Bahrain E-Commerce Environment: Growth, Regulations, and New Developments\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district, corporate headquarters., total e-commerce revenues in Bahrain are forecast to reach BHD 368 million by the end of 2025, with digital payments (especially mobile wallets) accounting for over 55% of online transactions. This is a direct result of years of focused reforms by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT), Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB), and the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB).\
Key 2025 Regulatory Changes:\
- As of February 2025, the CBB‚Äôs updated ‚ÄúOpen Banking Framework 2.0‚Äù requires all payment gateways to undergo annual third-party security audits.\
- MOICT now mandates Digital Commerce Registration via Sijilat for all online businesses processing payments in the Kingdom, regardless of legal structure.\
Importantly, Bahrain‚Äôs ecosystem makes it possible to launch a 100% foreign-owned e-commerce company without a local partner (see 99% and 100% foreign ownership details). This openness means both startups and multinationals are racing to capture a growing‚Äîand increasingly discerning‚Äîcustomer base.\
\
Personal aside: I once had a tech client set up shop in Seef, thinking they could skip the Digital Commerce addendum in their Sijilat application. The result? A two-week delay due to missing compliance steps. Once we corrected (thanks to a helpful MOICT official who knew my regular coffee order), we were live in days.\
\
Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Arabia: E-Commerce Gateway Landscape\
Whereas Dubai‚Äôs regulations can seem labyrinthine and Saudi‚Äôs are often opaque, Bahrain offers a transparent process‚Äîespecially for those who understand the ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù for MOICT submissions (between 10:00‚Äì11:00 AM on Mondays, in my experience, minimizes wait times).\
Official resources:\
- Bahrain.com Government Resources\
- Gulf News ‚Äì Regional Developments\
Further, Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat system (the online commercial registration portal) and friendly EDB officers in the Diplomatic Area have made the Kingdom a hub for agile, cross-border digital commerce.\
\
Why Secure Payment Gateways Matter in Bahrain‚Äôs E-Commerce\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration‚Äîteam working on payment gateway integration in an office.), with phishing attacks targeting popular Gulf e-commerce platforms.\
But here‚Äôs where Bahrain stands out: CBB‚Äôs strict requirements turn what could be an administrative headache into a real competitive advantage. Customers trust Bahraini e-commerce brands because the gateways are stringently regulated, with bank-level encryption and data handling.\
Key customer trust requirements:\
* PCI-DSS compliance (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)\
* 3D Secure authentication (Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode)\
* Strong SSL/TLS encryption\
* Real-time fraud monitoring and dispute resolution\
* Full transparency on currency conversion and local/BHD processing\
Surprisingly, failing to implement even one of these can jeopardize your Sijilat renewal or result in heavy fines (my client in Bahrain Bay nearly lost their license over a missed compliance audit‚Äîthankfully, we caught the issue in time).\
Related tangent: I once attended a majlis-style networking meeting in Adliya, where a veteran merchant explained how coffee service rituals mirror online trust-building. If you shortchange the coffee, or the payment flow, word spreads quickly!\
\
Core Regulatory Requirements for Payment Gateways\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for payment gateways, contract signing with compliance audit theme.).\
- Requires submitting an updated digital commerce addendum, including gateway provider details and security policy.\
3. Data Protection Compliance\
- Bahrain Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL, Law 30 of 2018) applies to all processors of payment data.\
- Explicit customer consent, clear data storage/disposal policies, and breach notification procedures are required.\
4. Cross-Border Settlement Rules\
- Any payment gateway handling foreign currency settlement must report monthly volumes to the CBB.\
- As of May 2025, new notification requirements apply for settlements above BHD 5,000/month.\
5. KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Protocols\
- Enhanced KYC for first-time customers and high-value transactions (over BHD 1,000).\
- Strict AML checks‚Äîespecially for cross-border payments and refunds.\
\
Pro Tip: Always prepare your CBB compliance documents before Sijilat submission. I keep a digital folder with templates, which has saved me‚Äîand my clients‚Äîhours during audits.\
\

\
Technical and Operational Security Standards\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation‚Äîbusinessman preparing payment gateway documentation in office workflow.**\
- Applies to both admin dashboard access and customer checkout (where possible).\
- SMS or app-based codes, plus device fingerprinting for high-risk transactions.\
4. Real-Time Fraud Detection\
- Integration with local fraud monitoring networks.\
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity; must be logged for two years.\
5. 3D Secure Implementation\
- Required for all BHD-denominated card payments.\
- 3D Secure version 2.0 preferred for better mobile/browser compatibility.\
Firsthand lesson: During a rush project in Diplomatic Area, our team missed the quarterly scan deadline by two days. The solution? Walked forms by hand to the CBB‚Äôs IT security window at 8:00 AM (and yes, the extra tamar dates with coffee helped the mood immensely).\

Most local gateways offer plugins for Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom APIs.\
\
Test transactions with local BHD cards and at least one GCC-based card to confirm compliance.\
\
\
Undergo Compliance Audit and Penetration Testing\
\
Schedule with a CBB-approved auditor (list available on Sijilat).\
\
Tip: Bundle this with your annual accounting audit to save costs and avoid duplicated site visits.\
\
\
Launch and Monitor Transactions\

* Digital Commerce Addendum: BHD 55 (annual)\
* Payment Gateway Setup Fee: BHD 75‚Äì250 (per provider)\
* Transaction Fees: 2.25‚Äì3.5% per transaction, + BHD 0.08‚Äì0.12 per authorization\
* Annual PCI Compliance Audit: BHD 900‚Äì1,500 (use an approved local auditor‚Äîdiscounts available for startups registered with Tamkeen)\
* Technical Integration/IT Cost:** BHD 300‚Äì750 (if hiring local freelance talent)\
For up-to-date breakdowns, check Keylink‚Äôs cost estimator.\
Expert tip: For budget-sensitive startups, I recommend starting with a ‚Äúlocal only‚Äù payment gateway (BENEFIT or Tap) before expanding to international options. This reduces both tech cost and regulatory review scope.\

- PCI compliance certificate\
- Data protection/privacy policy\
- Transaction monitoring and KYC procedures\
See Sijilat registration requirements for a step-by-step checklist.\
Can foreign-owned companies operate e-commerce payment gateways in Bahrain?\

What are the most cost-effective payment gateways for startups in Bahrain?\
BENEFIT and Tap offer the lowest setup fees (from BHD 75‚Äì100) and competitive transaction rates. For scaling or global sales, add PayTabs or Amazon Payment Services later. Get a tailored estimate from Keylink‚Äôs cost page.\
How do I maintain compliance after setup?\
Schedule annual PCI audits, renew your Sijilat digital commerce addendum, and keep records for 24 months. Consider an accounting service (more info) for ongoing compliance support.\
What‚Äôs the benefit of Bahrain Free Zones for e-commerce businesses?\
Free zones offer additional tax incentives, expedited customs procedures, and sometimes lower setup fees (see free zone guide). However, most payment gateways require a standard Sijilat CR for integration.\

Ear mites in cats can be a distressing problem for both pets and their owners. These minuscule parasites thrive in the warm, dark environment of a cat's ear canal, causing irritation and discomfort. To effectively rid ear mites in cats, a comprehensive approach is necessary.

Start by identifying the symptoms of ear mites, which include excessive scratching of the ears, shaking of the head, and dark, coffee-ground-like debris in the ear canal. If you suspect your cat has ear mites, consult with a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend a thorough examination to confirm the presence of these parasites.

Medications are the most effective way to eliminate ear mites. The veterinarian might prescribe one of the following:

Topical treatments: These are applied directly to the ear, often in the form of drops or ointments.
Oral medications: These treat the infection systemically and can be very effective.
Injections: For severe cases, a veterinarian might administer an injection that can rapidly eliminate ear mites.


In conjunction with medication, cleaning your cat‚Äôs ears is crucial. Use a veterinarian-approved ear cleaner to gently wipe away debris in the ear canal. Avoid using cotton swabs as they can push debris deeper into the ear. Perform ear cleaning as directed by your veterinarian to ensure safety.

Preventing ear mites involves regular check-ups and keeping your cat's environment clean. Regular grooming and avoiding contact with infected animals can also help reduce the risk of reinfestation. By taking these proactive steps, you can successfully rid ear mites in cats and restore your feline's comfort and health.

* **Friday:** Guest arrivals, followed by a relaxed evening BBQ with a live band, ending around 11 PM.

Would love feedback on how Suno interprets subtle emotional tones, or tips for getting it to stick closer to intended lyrics. Anyone else wish there was a way to upload a post-production version? Drop thoughts below!

\[Intro\]  
Sunrise paints the window pane, a fresh start, clean slate.  
Thought I‚Äôd finally cracked the code, escaped the ticking gate.  
Coffee steamin‚Äô, quiet breath, a world held in a frame.  
Just for a second, thought we beat this, the ever-present game.  
  
\[Verse 1\]  
Woke up with a blueprint, lines drawn crystal clear  
Planned out every single step, to banish every fear  
Said, ‚ÄúHey, good morning,‚Äù hoping that the message would just stick  
You just nodded, half a smile, felt a silent little click.  
Later, asked about the plans, ‚ÄúDinner, six, that little place?‚Äù  
You said, ‚ÄúThought you meant tomorrow,‚Äù wiping sleep from off your face.  
A tiny ripple, barely felt, no tidal wave, no crash  
Just a whisper on the wire, gone too quick, a fleeting flash.  
  
\[Pre-Chorus\]  
And the dial just keeps on spinning, searching for a clearer line  
Is it me, or is it static, blurring all the signs?  
We talk in circles, almost touch, then somehow lose the thread  
Wishing we could just connect, with all the words unsaid.  
  
\[Chorus\]  
Oh, Miss Communication, you‚Äôre the ghost in every room  
Stealing sunlight from the morning, casting shadows through the gloom.  
We try to build a bridge with words, but you just take an axe,  
Another perfect day unravels, beneath your subtle tracks.  
Miss Communication, yeah, you‚Äôre always there, it seems,  
The silent architect of broken dreams.  
  
\[Verse 2\]  
Thought I sent a clear transmission, signal strong and true.  
A casual comment, just a thought, between me and you.  
You caught the tone, but missed the point, an unintended slight,  
Suddenly the sunny morning dipped into a shade of night.  
It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre speaking different tongues, though fluent in the same,  
One word shifts, an inference lost, and everything‚Äôs aflame.  
Tried to back-track, re-explain, to mend the broken wire,  
But the message got corrupted, fueling an unspoken fire.  
Another day, another puzzle, can‚Äôt quite piece it right.  
The frequency is just off-kilter, blurring all the light.  
  
\[Pre-Chorus\]  
And the dial just keeps on spinning, searching for a clearer line  
Is it me, or is it static, blurring all the signs?  
We talk in circles, almost touch, then somehow lose the thread  
Wishing we could just connect, with all the words unsaid.  
  
\[Chorus\]  
Oh, Miss Communication, you‚Äôre the ghost in every room  
Stealing sunlight from the morning, casting shadows through the gloom.  
We try to build a bridge with words, but you just take an axe,  
Another perfect day unravels, beneath your subtle tracks.  
Miss Communication, yeah, you‚Äôre always there, it seems,  
The silent architect of broken dreams.  
  
\[Bridge\]  
Is there a language that we‚Äôre missing? A dictionary unwritten?  
I reach across the chasm, hoping to be smitten  
By clarity, by understanding, a moment truly shared.  
Lost in translation‚Ä¶ never prepared  
To decode the silent spaces, the gaps where meanings fray.  
Just slips away‚Ä¶ everyday  
A fragile hope for resonance, just wishing you could hear‚Ä¶  
The echoes of my fear

1mzvyt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mzvyt5/31m_found_coworker_crossing_boundaries_with_my/,31M found coworker crossing boundaries with my 43F wife,"(Updated)I (31M) recently found some things that shook me. My wife (43F) works at a college, and through her phone I discovered deleted screenshots of messages from a coworker (M) inviting her for drinks.

One of his texts literally said:

‚ÄúBtw not sure if you have plans tomorrow night but I am planning a little time off for myself. Might go for a beer somewhere. Wife is being all kinds of weird rn so I am starting to make time for me.‚Äù

I also saw:
	‚Ä¢	He invited her for coffee earlier in the month.
	‚Ä¢	When she skipped a work event, he texted that he ‚Äúmissed her.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Another message showed him saying he was trying to find more excuses for them to meet for work.

I never got to see her responses, only his messages. She says she never wanted anything with him, it was purely work, and that he knows she‚Äôs married (we are recently married). She told me she was collecting the screenshots to show her supervisors because she felt uncomfortable.

I also read messages between her and her secretary, and they were both calling him weird and creepy. So it seems like she wasn‚Äôt interested in him at all.

But here‚Äôs the part that hit me hard: I checked our phone bill, and in the month of March they exchanged over 500 text messages. I can‚Äôt see the content, only the number of texts, but that made me feel sick.

When I confronted her, she said she understood my concerns and promised her secretary will handle all interactions with him going forward. I even texted the guy myself to tell him off, and he responded:

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt hear from me ever again or my name ever again I promise.‚Äù

Even with that, I‚Äôm still struggling. She keeps deleting messages even after I told her that makes it worse for me.

Now I‚Äôm torn:
	‚Ä¢	Part of me wants to report this guy to his boss/HR so it doesn‚Äôt happen again to someone else.
	‚Ä¢	Part of me just wants to move on, but I don‚Äôt know how to rebuild trust when I feel like she‚Äôs hiding things.

Follow this 30 day plan that actually works,"i‚Äôm jerry from wonsulting. I'm sick of seeing all these 1 off job search tips ""use this 1 LinkedIn hack"" ""tailor your resume to every job application"" ""networking is the only way I got hired"". Great to use as 1 off hack and may work. But not exhaustive. 

After 10 years of being in this space, i've braindumped everything I know about the job search. It's exactly what I do to help my friends get jobs, so i hope it's helpful for you too. 

if you‚Äôre stuck, this is your plan for the next 30 days. save it. copy paste it. ask questions in the comments and i‚Äôll jump in.

the core truth

most people fail because they chase 3 to 5 job titles and dilute their story. pick ONE target job title and build everything around it. yes i‚Äôm yelling. you only get noticed as a specialist

how the job search really works

companies run a simple process: open headcount, post a jd, recruiter screens, hiring manager decides. your goal is not ‚Äúapply more.‚Äù your goal is to get pulled forward by a human, or show up as an obvious fit for exactly one role.

ok let‚Äôs get to work.

Day 1: pick ONE title + the 5 job description scan

* pick your single target title for the next 2 weeks. examples: product manager. data analyst. marketing manager.
* open 5 recent jds for that exact title. scan and tally the repeated skills, tools, outcomes. make a quick map: must haves, nice to haves, business outcomes.
* lock your choice. **no switching (IMPORTANT)** for 2 weeks. you can reassess on day 14 if needed.

why this matters: specialists get hired. generalists get ignored.

Days 2 to 3: fix your resume to a quality bar

* Use your favorite tools or get feedback from your mentor and push your resume to be recruiting ready. remove duties. add impact. include the repeated keywords from your 5-jd scan.
* quick bullet formula you can steal: action verb + scope + method + measurable result.
   * example: ‚Äúled launch of onboarding flow with 3 engineers & 1 VP across 3 markets to optimize drop off rates, cutting the total drop off by 22% in 60 days.‚Äù
   * do NOT use bullets like: ""launched a new onboarding flow""
* don‚Äôt move to applying until you hit the bar. you‚Äôre about to send 50 targeted apps, so set the foundation right.

Days 4 to 10: apply to 50 jobs for that title + start networking

* apply to 50 roles that match your title. yes 50. all with the same tailored resume and a matching cover letter where useful. jobboardai can one click tailor each app.
* in parallel, run the 4 tiers of applying. tier 1 and 2 beat tier 3 and 4 every time:
   1. hiring manager recommendation
   2. hiring team member recommendation
   3. referral
   4. cold online apply how to run it: for each target company, message 10 relevant people. wait 3 days. if no replies, apply and move on. keep volume high, keep it polite.

copy paste messages you can use today

* LinkedIn invite to hiring manager: hi \[name\] i saw you‚Äôre hiring for \[role\] on \[team\]. my background in \[2 relevant skills\] lines up well. would love to connect and learn more, happy to share concise bullets on how i can help.
* after they accept, the ‚Äúcoffee chat‚Äù ask: hi \[name\] thanks for connecting. i loved your post about \[specific\]. i‚Äôm targeting \[exact role\] and can share a 3 bullet summary of relevant wins if helpful. open to a 10 minute chat this week? i can send times.
* after a helpful chat, the referral ask: thanks again for the time. i saw req \[job id\] for \[role\]. based on \[1 sentence fit\], would you be open to referring me or pointing me to the right person to speak with? happy to make it easy for you with a short blurb and resume.

track your data

* log each application and each outreach. the only metric that matters this week is interviews booked. your short term goal is 1 interview to unlock 3 more.

Days 11 to 14: wait 2 weeks from your first application, then audit

* if you‚Äôve applied to 50 roles for one title and got 0 to 1 interviews after 2 weeks, change the resume or narrow the title. if you have 2+ interviews, keep going with the same resume. consistency wins.
* common fixes: tighten your headline to the exact title, put your strongest projects first, and mirror the jd language.
* keep the outreach going. repeat the 10 messages per company rule before you apply. if no replies in 3 days, apply and move on.

Days 15 to 21: interview prep that maps to the jd

* build 6 stories with the car method: context, action, result. pull each from the outcomes in your 5 jds.
* practice out loud. record yourself. fix rambling, quantify results, and make sure at least 1 story proves team leadership and 1 proves speed.
* thank you + follow up system after every interview: connect on linkedin, send a short thank you, then a gentle nudge if you have updates. copy paste:
   * ‚Äúthank you for the conversation about \[role\]. i‚Äôll share a one pager on \[relevant project\] if helpful. excited for next steps.‚Äù

Days 18 to 24: use interviews to unlock more interviews

the moment you land interview 1, tell other companies. this is not flexing. it signals you‚Äôre moving and forces tighter timelines. copy paste these:

* dm to recruiter or hiring manager hi \[name\] quick timing heads up. i have an interview with \[company a\] on \[date\] and expect feedback by \[day\]. your \[role title\] is a top choice for me. if it helps, i can make time this week for a screen or hiring manager chat. what‚Äôs the fastest way to move forward?
* email to a recruiter you already spoke with subject: quick timing update hi \[name\] i‚Äôm interviewing with \[company a\] on \[date\] and they plan to decide by \[day\]. i‚Äôm very interested in \[role title\] here. if we can set up the next step this week, i can hold time. do \[two options\] work?
* 24 hours before another company decides hi \[name\] i expect a decision from \[company a\] tomorrow. i want to keep \[company b\] in play. if a same day screen or hiring manager chat is possible, i‚Äôll make it work.

Days 22 to 26: keep stacking interviews, keep sending updates

* every time you book a new screen, repeat the timing message to 5 to 10 more companies. calm. direct. no begging. no bragging.

Days 27 to 30: offers and negotiation

* mindset: collaborative not combative. both sides want the same thing.
* research range first, then ask. sample script for the call: ‚Äúthank you for the offer, i‚Äôm excited. based on market data for \[city\] and my scope in \[project\], roles like this land around \[x to y\]. is there flexibility to bring base closer to that range?‚Äù
* if base is fixed: ask about signing bonus, equity, start date, pto, professional development budget. confirm everything in writing.

the full process at a glance

find jobs ‚Üí apply ‚Üí interview ‚Üí negotiate. myth: keep each stage separate. reality: use an offer or even an interview to accelerate other interviews. myth: ‚Äúats eats resumes.‚Äù reality: a human still screens most resumes unless a role closes early. your job is to reach that human faster.

quick templates library

* resume bullet drove \[metric\] by \[action\], across \[scope\], resulting in \[business outcome\].
* networking follow up after coffee chat thanks again for the time, \[name\]. i‚Äôm excited about req \[job id\] on \[team\]. if you‚Äôre open, i‚Äôd appreciate a referral or an intro to the right person. i‚Äôll make it easy with a short blurb and resume.
* post interview thank you thank you for the conversation on \[topic\]. attaching a one pager on \[relevant project\] that ties to \[team goal\]. looking forward to next steps.
* ‚Äúuse 1 interview to unlock 3‚Äù opener hi \[name\] quick timing note. i‚Äôm in process with \[company a\] and expect feedback by \[day\]. \[company b\] is a top choice for me. can we fast track a screen this week?

how to know if it‚Äôs working

* after 50 targeted applications to one title and 2 weeks elapsed, you want at least 2 interviews. if not, change the resume or narrow the title. if yes, keep going.
* remember: tier 1 and tier 2 beat tier 3 and 4. humans over portals alrdy.

final mindset

you don‚Äôt need to be perfect. you need to be obvious for one job. then you use that momentum to get more shots. if you post progress below, i‚Äôll help you troubleshoot line by line.",2,1756140858.0,Wonsulting,1,0.75,False

I am 44, almost 45. Definitely been having shorter and irregular cycles and other symptoms of peri. But have never had a true panic attack before and am not sure this is what I‚Äôm experiencing. 

Friday: 
I was jet lagged from an international flight. Tired and a little out of it, but it was lunchtime. I ate a peach. And immediately after eating the peach, my mouth started feeling numb (I‚Äôm NOT allergic to peaches), then my face started getting tingly, my heart rate shot up and it felt like my throat was closing in and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was hyperventilating I think. Also had this very weird, new-to-me, sense of depersonalization / derealization (the worst symptom!). Like these aren‚Äôt my hands, it‚Äôs not me talking. The crazy thing is that I had to pick up my daughter from school, so I could breathe and perform all needed tasks, just in this state I could only describe as sheer panic that was primarily impacting my neck up‚Ä¶ and high heart rate. My pulse was sky high. I took Vitamin C and a shower, then a nap, and things kind of regulated themselves. 

Saturday:
Woke up and started the day with protein first, did normal things, felt okay. Like it was a one time event. 

Sunday:
Had coffee, then an apple‚Ä¶ and another episode of this tingly mouth, numb face, panic situation, fast breathing, heart rate elevation, ‚Äúare these my hands, am I talking‚Äù sensations mentally (the most scary!)

#The Husband
Enter: Monji Kadokura - an archaeologist and (not so much a) family man with a wife and two kids. His wife was in an accident at Christmas, leaving her in a vegetative state. Kadokura visits Funiculi Funicula with a Polaroid photo of him and his wife, taken at the cafe when they first visited 25 odd years ago. He hasn‚Äôt visited the cafe since‚Ä¶ Until today. The reason? To find out if the rumours really are true.

The opening scene sees Kadokura learning about the rules of the cafe from Nagare. He is very intrigued by the rule set and poses questions even Nagare hasn‚Äôt previously considered - **‚ÄùHow do words conveyed from someone from the future remain in the memories of the people they visit?‚Äù** - he wants to know if he can visit his wife, Mieko, and tell her things that will stay with her. Fortunately, Kazu is there to shed light on this, suggesting the memories should not fade. Also in the cafe is Fumiko, a former student of Kadokura‚Äôs, and a cafe regular after visiting previously to travel back in time to see her boyfriend. Through the ensuing conversation Kadokura learns that the woman in *that* seat, Kazu‚Äôs mother Kaname, is a ghost and that attempting to forcibly remove her from the seat results in the person becoming cursed. Kadokura doesn‚Äôt believe Kaname is a ghost and asks to try out being cursed. Of course. Who *wouldn‚Äôt* want to experience being cursed by a ghost? As you guessed, he gets cursed. But he requests to stay in this state to fully experience the curse before its removed by Kazu giving the ghost another coffee. Eventually Kadokura affirms his decision to travel and is told he must wait for the seat to be unoccupied. Once it is, he finds himself asking more questions about how the time travel works, whether or not it has to be that specific seat or just a seat in that location. Through his analysis of the area we learn that the time travel segment of the cafe is housed in an 80cm envelope that has a cooler ambience to the rest of the cafe.

Kadokura time travels and winds up 3 years in the past. He‚Äôs met by his three children, grandchild, and wife. The kids are surprised to see him and wonder if he‚Äôs there for the anniversary. Kadokura has **no idea** who‚Äôs anniversary they are referring to and this greatly angers all his kids. Eventually his wife mentions its their anniversary. Through all this conversation a lot of time is lost and Kadokura realises he still hasn‚Äôt done what he neede to do. He checks with Kazu if what he says can, instead of altering the present, shift the timeframe in which the events of the present occur. She can‚Äôt confirm or deny the outcome which is enough for Kadokura to proceed in candidly telling his wife and their kids that she‚Äôll be in an accident in 6-months that leaves her in a vegetative state. If the kids weren‚Äôt pissed about him forgetting the anniversary, this throws them over the edge. They can‚Äôt understand *why* he would travel back in time just to bring them bad news. He then goes on to tell his wife that he wanted her to know that his happiness in life is because of her and didn‚Äôt want to forgo the opportunity to let her know. He then downs the coffee and is brought back to the present where he rushes out of the cafe and makes the journey to his wife in hospital, hoping that the timeline may have shifted slightly. It doesn‚Äôt.

#The Farewell
I hope you have a your tissues ready :(

Enter: Nana Kohtake - a nurse and cafe regular, and Mutsuo Hikita - a dog daddy that often visits the cafe. Mutsuo wants his wife to travel back in time to say her final goodbye to their dog Apollo, as she fell asleep during his final moments.

Mutsuo discusses the death of his dog with Nana, another cafe customer. He mentions that he heard read about the cafe in a magazine and wants his wife, Sunao, to travel back to say goodbye. The magazine is several years old but lead to a temporary surge in custom at Funiculi Funicula. Nagare shows surprise at the fact that the magazine still exists. Anywho, Mutsuo tells the story of how Sunao fell asleep during Apollo‚Äôs final moments, waking up to find him lying still beside her. 

We‚Äôre transported a few days later to Sunao arriving at the cafe after the summer monsoon has ended. She uses the excuse that she‚Äôs returning a brolly her husband borrowed when really she wants to travel back in time at his suggestion. She plays koi with Kazu, who never bites, letting the customers speak in their own time. Eventually, after water and juice, Sunao admits she wants to go back but is perturbed to learn that she cannot physically be with Apollo at the end, even if she travels back to the right day. Mutsuo omitted the full details of the time travel rules as a way to save his wife‚Äôs feelings, something he often does that she is very grateful for. After hearing the strict rules from Kazu Sunao is uncertain. Before she makes her decision we get a cute little story about Apollo comes to be a part of the Hikita family as a puppy. 

Sunao seems disappointed at the rules and decides she *doesn‚Äôt* want to travel back in time. She ponders over her conversation with Mutsuo, and over everything she has learnt from Kazu, and decides she doesn‚Äôt want to go back in time. The ghost of Kaname gets up from *that* seat and Kazu asks Sunao if she would like to take a seat. This throws Sunao off until she remembers what Mutsuo told her about the ghost in the chair. She converses with Kazu about her inhibitions and Kazu makes a her realise that going back would give her the opportunity to say goodbye and alleviate some of the regret she is feeling. 

Sunao takes her seat, travels back in time, and is awoken up the nostalgic sound of Apollo‚Äôs ‚ÄúRUFF!‚Äù Only it isn‚Äôt nostalgia, she‚Äôs gone back a couple of years and Mutsuo is visiting the cafe while walking Apollo. The two converse about why Sunao is here when she is supposed to be visiting her parents. Mutsuo then learns that it‚Äôs a future version of Sunao and questions her about it, realising that she‚Äôs travelled for Apollo. She tells Mutsuo the full story of how Apollo died, while she had fallen asleep, and Mutsuo lets her in on a little secret. Apollo always waits for Sunao to fall asleep before doing so himself. He often pretended to be asleep to allow her to fall asleep, and then would awake and check she was asleep before actually doing so himself. Mutsuo reasons that Apollo couldn‚Äôt have died alone because he died where he always felt safest - asleep next to a resting Sunao. 

Sunao returns to the present and ponders over the fact that she has not changed her circumstances but can live a happier life in memoriam of Apollo.

ABOUT ME AND WHAT BROUGHT ME TO FINDOM: 

I am a 37 y/o cis female who is happily married. I have always sensed I had a money fetish of some sort (extra excitement/dopamine from winning it or when my husband would Zelle me), but gifts and acts of service have always been my love language. Before finding findom on here, I was hunting around for a similar situation (Phrendly, etc) to no avail. 

Also important to note, I am married to an Alpha. Which was fine for the first 8 years or so. As our family grew, I shifted to work from home while also taking care of everyone at the house. At the time, it suited our financial situation. But here I am, years later, tired, overwhelmed, and often thought of last because of my  role in the home. Don't get me wrong, being in control of the house gives me some sense of power, but not the type I feel I deserve. So I am here now, because I require Princess treatment. I work too damn hard all day long to not be someone's Goddess.  I am a force to be reckoned with, and I am ready to take what's not being given.

Spoiler: I dropped about **20 lbs** over **March to May 2025**, with a lean body fat drop from around **14% to 9%**.

# My Setup

* **When:** Started March 1, ended May 31, 2025
* **Starting Weight:** 209 lb ‚Üí **Ending Weight:** 191 lb
* **Body Fat:** \~14% ‚Üí \~9%
* **Protocol:** Low-carb, high-protein diet + cardio + Hydroxyelite stack.

# What I Loved

* **Appetite Suppression:** Snack attacks gone. Seriously, I was way less hungry.
* **Energy & Focus:** Gym sessions were on point‚Äîsolid energy and laser-sharp mind, pretty much on par with other Hi-Tech fat burners.

# Side Effects (aka the ‚ÄúKeep-in-mind‚Äù section)

* **Jitters** if taken on an empty stomach‚Äînot terrible, but noticeable.
* **Sweating:** More thermogenesis = more sweat in the gym. Some love it, some despise it.
* **Sleep Disruptions:** Taking it too late (after \~4 PM) made it hard to sleep‚ÄîI was aiming for a 10 PM bedtime.

# Dosing Strategy

* **Standard:** 1‚Äì2 caps in the morning before breakfast + 1 after lunch. Ramp up as tolerance builds‚Äîdo **not exceed 4 caps/day**.
* **My Routine:** 2 caps when waking (30 mins before breakfast), then 2 more about 3 hours after lunch (1 hr before workout).
* **Pro Tip:** Avoid stacking caffeine or other stimulants‚Äîthis has plenty already.

# Who Might Benefit (and who shouldn‚Äôt)

**Good Fit For:**

* Experienced users of stimulant-based fat burners
* Bodybuilders or athletes in a cut phase
* Folks wanting energy + appetite control (without coffee/energy drinks)
* Those aiming to shed serious weight

**Maybe Skip It If:**

* You‚Äôre new to stimulants or sensitive to them
* You struggle sleeping or get jitters easily
* You‚Äôre pregnant, have health issues, or are on medication‚Äîalways consult a doctor first!

# TL;DR

* **Result:** Lost 20 lbs, hit \~9% body fat.
* **Pros:** Appetite kill-off, strong energy, great focus.
* **Cons:** Jitters, extra sweating, sleep issues if taken too late.
* **Dosage:** Up to 4 caps/day, but start slow. No extra caffeine.

**Bottom line?** [Hydroxyelite](https://supplementwarehouse.com/products/hydroxyelite) (spring ‚Äô25 cycle) delivered‚Äîespecially on appetite suppression. But use it smart: start low, watch the clock, and keep caffeine in check.

I‚Äôm a little confused about which K-drama I should start next, so I thought I‚Äôd ask for some suggestions here. I‚Äôve only recently gotten into K-dramas, but so far, the ones I‚Äôve watched have completely pulled me in with their storytelling, emotions, and unforgettable characters.

Here are a few of the shows I‚Äôve loved so far:
	1.	Coffee Prince ‚Äì I really enjoyed the unique concept, the chemistry between the leads, and how it dealt with themes of identity and love.
	2.	Crash Landing on You ‚Äì The mix of romance, humor, and suspense kept me hooked, and I found the cross-border storyline very touching.
	3.	Reply 1988 ‚Äì I adored the warmth of family and friendship in this one. It had such a nostalgic, comforting vibe that made me feel at home.
	4.	Flower of Evil ‚Äì This drama completely blew my mind with its suspense and emotional intensity. I loved the darker, thriller aspect paired with deep romance.
	5.	When the Phone Rings ‚Äì I enjoyed the mystery and emotional layers in the story. It kept me curious till the end.

We would like a very nice, luxe feeling resort with a great beach and lots of good food/drink options. 

While staying at the airbnb we would like somewhere we can hike, snorkel, try bars/restaurants, coffee shops and the more walkable the better. Since we like to spend a lot of time exploring, somewhere that we can do so feeling safe is also important for us. 

I have looked into anguilla, st lucia, st kitts, antigua and grenada but am largely over whelmed by all of the options. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1mzvfcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mzvfcm/explore_if_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Explore if the best espresso machine Breville Bambino Plus delivers,"Testing out the Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine BES500DBL1BUS1 has genuinely altered my morning coffee routine. As someone who always rushes through the morning chaos, I‚Äôve been on the lookout for a machine that‚Äôs compact, efficient, and gives me that caf√©-style espresso at home. This machine, with its sleek design and promise of professional results, didn‚Äôt disappoint, though there are some quirks to consider. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve put its features to the test, and here‚Äôs how it performed.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This espresso machine is a stunner. Its compact footprint (it‚Äôs only about 7.5 inches wide) makes it perfect for my cluttered kitchen counter, where space is always a premium. The Damson Blue finish adds a sophisticated and modern touch, blending seamlessly with other kitchen appliances. It feels sturdy and has a premium build that screams durability. Honestly, I wasn't expecting something so small to feel so robust! Its minimalist design, with buttons for its user interface, makes it straightforward and unintimidating‚Äîideal for beginners like me.

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Using this machine is straightforward. With a few buttons for cup sizes and steaming, I wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed by too many options or settings. The digital temperature control ensures each cup of espresso extracts at the right temperature‚Äîsaving me from the frustration of bitter-tasting shots. I particularly appreciated the auto purge function, which automatically resets the heat system after steaming milk. I don‚Äôt have to worry about preparing the machine for my next espresso‚Äîit‚Äôs all handled. My nine-year-old was even fascinated watching the process, exclaiming, ‚ÄúIs this how baristas do it?‚Äù  

[Check Breville Bambino Plus BES500DBL1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0bdmtkf5b/)  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Coffee lovers are in for a treat here. The Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Machine nails that third-wave specialty coffee experience. I loved the low-pressure pre-infusion feature; it‚Äôs a game-changer. By gently pre-infusing the coffee grounds before extraction, I got richer, more balanced espresso shots each time. And let‚Äôs talk heat-up speed‚Äîmy mornings are hectic, and this machine heats up in three seconds! The ThermoJet heating system ensures there‚Äôs no waiting around, which is perfect for those of us rushing out the door.

**Highlights**  
- The ThermoJet heating system was mind-blowingly fast and efficient.  
- Low-pressure pre-infusion delivered consistently great flavor.  
- Small, compact design with a stylish shade fits perfectly in tight spaces.  

**The Milk Frother Magic**  
Ah, the automatic steam wand‚Äîthis was where my love affair with the machine deepened. Since I‚Äôm a latte and cappuccino fanatic, getting barista-quality milk foam is non-negotiable for me. The adjustable milk temperature and texture options made it easy to customize the froth to my liking. With this, I‚Äôve even dabbled in making basic latte art, though my six-year-old says my designs look more like clouds exploding. It‚Äôs not perfect every time, but I blame my shaky hands, not the machine.

**Critiques**  
While I‚Äôm smitten with many aspects of this espresso maker, it‚Äôs not without flaws:  
- Cleaning the milk steam wand can be a bit fiddly. It‚Äôs not hard‚Äîjust a bit more time-consuming than I‚Äôd like.  
- The buttons, while basic and functional, don‚Äôt offer a premium tactile response.  
- The included tamper and razor tool felt cheap compared to the overall quality of the machine, almost like an afterthought.  

**Competing Products**  
For comparison, I‚Äôve tried the De'Longhi Dedica and the Nespresso Creatista in the past. The De'Longhi Dedica is also compact and budget-friendly, but it doesn‚Äôt quite hit the mark on flavor extraction the way this espresso machine does with its pre-infusion feature. On the other hand, the Nespresso Creatista offers more automatic functions and requires minimal input, but it lacks the same manual customization that coffee enthusiasts like myself crave. One significant edge this product has over both competitors? Its perfect balance between automation and customization, offering enough control to tweak settings but still staying approachable.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
If you‚Äôre wondering whether this espresso machine is worth the investment, it certainly punches above its compact size. It‚Äôs a mid-range machine that delivers premium features, such as digital temperature control and an automatic steam wand. Compared to higher-end machines costing twice as much, it provides nearly identical results, making it feel like smart spending. That said, only those who plan to use it often (I‚Äôm talking daily cappuccinos and americanos) will get the most value out of it. For casual users, a simpler budget model might suffice.

1mzveqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MRE/comments/1mzveqf/italian_review_and_signal_appreciation/,Italian Review and Signal Appreciation!,"This is my first ration review (fairly rare one too). Signal asked me to do a shout out, which I've received 5 orders from him over the past 2 years, and there hasn't been a single issue! Thank you my friend! I was lucky enough to snag a Module F with Cordial.

The semi-metallic ration pack contains 3 meal boxes, broken up in to Breakfast, Lunch, and Supper. I did not try the teas or coffee. All items were heated on stovetop. Cutlery was standard flimsy and got the job done.

Breakfast was too light and started off with a bang. Needed some protein.  
\- Sweet Biscuits: Nice and sweet, paired REALLY well with the jam.  
\- Apricot Jam: I either wanted more to go with the sweet biscuits or have more sweet biscuits. Nice flavor to it, but a little hard to spread with the spoon.  
\- Cappuccino: Decent flavor, nothing special. Sadly, I wasn't able to get it dissolved completely. I wish I didn't add the cordial to it.  
\- Cordial: 40% during breakfast? Damn. Sweet and strong on it's own, but had a slight plastic taste to it.

Lunch was very hearty and unique with the bran and multi-vitamin tablets. Well-rounded.  
\- Minestrone: Nice, seasoned well, and rich. Flavor of a tomato base with beans, carrot, peas, and potato.  
\- Fruit Cocktail: Same Dole Fruit Cocktail minus the cherries.. Unlucky I guess.  
\- Beef in Jelly: Jelly was cooked off and the beef had a nice meaty flavor and moisture to it. Paired really well with the crackers.  
\- 2 Pack Crackers: Beat to hell, and went well with the beef and minestrone.

Dinner was lighter and a nice end to the day. Well-rounded.  
\- Ravioli Ragu: Honestly, a better consistency Chef Boyardee (don't hurt me). Lighter sauce, and the meat was pleasant.  
\- Tuna with Beans: Surprised by this one and it was delicious. Ate it cold and the beans were a unique but nice touch. Went well with the crackers. Oily with a tomato base.  
\- Energy Bars: What a nice chocolate and apricot flavor. Easy to eat and a nice treat.  
\- 1 Pack Crackers: Same as above, except more beat up.

All in all, the Italian ration was a cleaner and lighter calorie ration with extra goodies that made it more complete. Bran tablets, multi-vitamins, toothbrush, easy to use stove, and water purification tabs. It would have been nice to have other drinks, something more electrolyte based. Packaging was larger for what it contained.

I also made a friend.  There was a coffee shop, and one of the baristas was getting off soon, so he sat with me and was super extroverted and kept the conversation going despite me being shy and kind of awkward.  

I'm a straight guy, but I kind of had a thing for him in the dream.  But I was afraid of my feelings for him, so I left and went back to the cubby room and was naked again.  

People didn't seem that surprised, just kind of smirked and went on with their conversations.  

ETA: Oh!  And this woman in there gave me a gift!

I've had a huge crush on Martha Masters from House MD forever, and I think this character was based on her.  She was shy, awkward, pretty weird.  

She gave me a plexi glass box that matched the glass cubby with my clothes.  It was full of dirt, and she told me it was a new one she thought I'd like.

Then she communicated via telepathy, sending me a mental image of the dirt growing trees.  She said it was laced with fast growing tree seeds and that I just needed to add water.  She told me the seeds were illegal but that it could be our secret

I hugged her then went to the bathroom to fill it up.  And the trees started growing immediately! 

So I went out all happy and set it on top of my cubby so the trees could grow on top.

Then I went back to her, and we smiled while watching the trees grow.  

But then I got anxious and asked her what if I put too much water and it leaks out and shorts out the grow lights?
