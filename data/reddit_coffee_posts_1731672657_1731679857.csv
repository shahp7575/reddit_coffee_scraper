1grx61m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroMotorcycles/comments/1grx61m/im_done_with_my_dsr_until_spring_2025/,I'm done with my DSR... until Spring 2025,"Hi everyone,  
It's a classic trend on the web to report only problems and issues with products; sometimes, it's the same in this community. So I want to spend some time reporting about my journey, which started in March with my Zero DSR MY2024 and ended today.  
I've never been a rider before. In Italy, almost everyone grows up with a Vespa in the garage, and that was what I was used to, but, as an EV enthusiast, I wanted to explore this new world that in Italy accounts for an astonishing 4% of the market share (I’m talking about cars, in the EU it is 17%). Yes, we are in a prehistoric era in terms of EV adoption. So, I took the bold move to buy a brand-new 2024 DSR to test the pros and cons of this engine transition.

[Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy](https://preview.redd.it/u2elmed9o21e1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee1ff0ba5ecb44ccedc1c5f1d38685be1f57658f)

As a no-pro rider, the first weeks were focused on getting in touch with the power, the driving position, the weight, and, of course, the range. Since then everything has been phenomenal. I'm lucky enough to live in Gorizia, the northeastern part of Italy, right on the border with Slovenia, and from here, Dolomites, Slovenian natural parks, and Croatia are easily reachable within the standard range of the DSR. Even with the imperceptible EV adoption, in Italy, the EV infrastructure is well present and distributed. Especially compared to Slovenia and Croatia. Think that even small towns with fewer than 100 inhabitants in the middle of nowhere (mountains and valleys) have at least a DC charging point. Thanks, EU!! In addition, this wide presence of type 2 charging points was the occasion to discover and spend some time in new places; places that with a car I wouldn’t have visited in the first place. Believe me, even if the 4 hours mark to completely charge the DSR from 0 to 100 seems the limiting factor for most of the riders, there were more times that I had to limit my lunch break to disconnect it from the charging point (to not incur to idle fees), than those I had to wait. Generally after 2 hours of riding, you still have +50% of the battery, and a coffee break, a lunch, or just a walk to stretch your leg, would give you enough time to charge the motorcycle and be ready for more road.

[Barcis Lake, Italy](https://preview.redd.it/onp4zlyvn21e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e360effa59ffbaedbb61ceca7de5c01b3e13b378)

Another factor that I really appreciated was the curiosity of other riders on my vehicle. Especially on the mountain passes, when you stop to take a picture or to enjoy the view, many were staring at the DSR, commenting, asking for information, and criticizing my choice. But I’m confident to say that most of them were just surprised to see such a vehicle known for its inability to replace an ICE motorcycle, reached that point. That was the best part of every journey.I don’t want to spend more time here on the obvious positive aspects of riding an electric motorcycle that make it superior to ICE. No heat between the legs in the summer, no vibrations, the possibility to enjoy nature without disrupting it with unnecessary noise, but be able to have fun anyway with sudden power output.

[Panoramica delle Vette, Italy](https://preview.redd.it/ayspl1rso21e1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c75b3c0672c8cfd1b60a3a4c10af3c68700b2d)

Of course, the motorcycle wasn’t perfect, but I don’t think that all the others are. First, the information provided by the website and the dealer were incomplete or unclear. I thought of being able to buy the DSR unlocked with the full power (36kW), as previously asked by my dealer, but only finding it out this impossibility after taking delivery. Another early issue was the impossibility of connecting the DSR with the app. On the 22^(nd) of March, the app was not updated yet to allow the pairing (a feature that came about two weeks later). The availability of upgradable features (faster charging rate, longer range, and heated grips) was only made available in mid-June. The keys for regular maintenance were not delivered to me, even if reported in the user manual. The last issue was relative to the built quality. Especially the plastics with visible panel gaps and prone to make annoying noises in the traditional Italian city center characterized by cobblestone. These were all annoying problems, that you don’t want to incur in a 20k euros motorcycle, but by choosing a niche product, you need to be prepared to not have everything perfect and be considered as a beta tester.

In conclusion, I’m overall really happy with this purchase. Probably the best of my life until now. The DSR made me live the best summer ever had, characterized by weekends full of new places discovered and people met. After reaching the mark of 10k km in 6 months, I can make it rest for the winter, planning longer and more adventurous journeys for 2025

Really appreciate this subreddit. I purchased a DeLonghi Magnifica XS over 10 years ago and it's been going strong in our household (two adults working at a startup + 3 kids) through covid and such without a hitch. We love this machine! My husband regularly touts it as one of the best purchases of our lives.

It's been a workhorse for us, making at least 5-6 double shots and 2-3 lattes (manual frother) daily and we definitely abuse this machine. Very lax on maintenance/etc. Various parts have broken over the years (something exploded one day when using the bypass) but it somehow kept turning on every morning. However, it finally appears to have died yesterday.  
  
So I am now eagerly (somewhat urgently) searching for a replacement! Main criteria for us are: (1) super auto, (2) low maintenance, (3) excellent coffee.

My instinct is to replace the DeLonghi with the same machine, given our positive experience. But, also considering the value of an upgrade to one with an auto-milk option? Would love any experience/advice re the maintenance and cleaning of those given our lack of time and attention to this.

Also curious to know: has the build of these gotten worse over the last few years?

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1grx2oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1grx2oz/woke_doesnt_vegan_vegan_doesnt_woke/,Woke doesn’t = Vegan; Vegan doesn’t = Woke,"“Why should I read this?” - Because it’ll provide you with a tool to differentiate between sincere, good-faith, non-virtue-signalling progressives, and their insincere, bad faith, virtue signalling opposites. 



The typical theme that people are pointing to when they use the word Woke is the reversal of MLK’s egalitarian dream: ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" E.g. where people are judged, not by the content of their character, but by their unchosen characteristics (e.g. sex, race, sexual orientation, etc.), e.g. what most progressives from the 60s to the early 2000s would have correctly considered bigotry. 



Veganism doesn’t fall under this category, but I have seen it erroneously referred to as “Woke” by partisan folk, presumably due to an association fallacy, that we’ve all experienced partisan people on both sides falling prey to. 



There are plenty of non-partisan, and even outright self-identifying Conservative Vegans: 
https://www.veganconservatives.org.uk/
https://www.vegblogger.com/blog/2019/07/vegetarians-and-vegans-voting-republican-and-supporting-president-trump.html
https://medium.com/@matthyams/i-m-a-proud-vegan-right-wing-republican-9d64d4f8c40e



This makes sense, as Conservatives, generally being more religious, are much more likely to believe in Moral Realism (e.g. that morality isn’t socially constructed; that morality is real and objective) instead of Moral Relativism (that morality is socially constructed and is subjective) which Progressives generally seem to favour. And, in addition to research favouring veganism, all three schools of normative ethics massively favour veganism; e.g. there’s little to no moral excuse to not be vegan in the modern world. 



Peterson’s often cited Viktor Frankl used his experience of the Holocaust to fuel his ethical work in helping others through psychotherapy. Similarly, Dr Hershaft, a Jewish Holocaust Survivor has dedicated a lot of his life to veganism:  
https://www.jewishtelegraph.com/prof_401.html
https://www.timesofisrael.com/holocaust-survivor-likens-treatment-of-livestock-to-shoah/



Conversely, in my experience, those who deny, excuse, justify or support Identity Politics/Wokeism are rarely ever vegan. 


I am both vegan, and anti-identity-politics/anti-woke; I believe in egalitarianism where the content of someone’s character is the most important thing about them, with their unchosen characteristics being the least important thing about them. I’m also a hopeful agnostic; I hope that Moral Realism is true, and act like it is. E.g. I act as if morality is objective, and consequently study and apply ethics to my life. 



There are 3 main schools of normative ethics (don’t get triggered; this isn’t me challenging you as a person; you are more than your beliefs and behaviours; I am just describing this as objectively as possible):





Re: Virtue ethics, which focuses on someone’s character, state of being; e.g. are they courageous or cowardly?:

The state of being that most people purchase animal products out of is unvirtuous; e.g. is one of needless, dishonest, licentiousness, self-indulgence, greed, etc.





Re: Deontology, which focuses on what actions we should and should not do:

Re: Kant's Categorical Imperative, or The Golden Rule, I wouldn't want to be imprisoned for my entire life, with no room to move, having to stand and sleep in my own shit, vomit, blood and piss, only for me and my family to be murdered in front of each other, in our 20s. Consequently, I don't think other sentient beings who can experience suffering should experience this either.




Re: Consequentialism, which focuses on the consequences of actions:



The consequences of animal livestock are awful for animals and humans (information below).



Consequently, there’s little justification not to be vegan in the modern world re: moral philosophy. 







In debating pro-woke folk online, I will often ask if they’re vegan. As above, such people rarely are. 



This too makes sense in line with virtue-signalling, etc. E.g. one of the critiques of woke people is that they’re virtue signalling, they’re not really trying to be good people, they’re just trying to look and feel good without DOING anything good; all they’re doing is attacking people who don’t follow their identity-politics based religion, alongside all of the other things they, through their own association fallacies, deem “bad.” 



Switching to a vegan diet requires work. Based on compassion and personal sacrifice, you’re changing a part of your behaviour that will impact you at least once a day, every day, forever.

And, as Peterson says: ""[Sacrifice] is being willing to give up something in the hopes of attaining something of greater value: something that’s deferred, mature, rich and harmonious with the lives around you... It is integrating our personal desires with those of our family, our city, our nation...  It is the higher principle that puts hedonistic self-gratification in its right place."" 
https://www.arcforum.com/videos/v/jordan-peterson-the-west-was-built-on-the-idea-of-sacrifice#:~:text=In%20Jordan's%20words%3A%20%22%5BSacrifice,city%2C%20our%20nation…



Someone going vegan is best off researching how to make this switch, and teaching themselves about nutrition, as well as simply learning how to make food that they enjoy eating. This is too much work, too much personal sacrifice for virtue signallers. 



I am not expecting to convert anyone here to veganism. I am posting this to increase awareness of the many anti-identity-politics folk who are vegan, and conversely, how a good bulk of “Woke” folk are not. I am posting because out of everything associated with “The Left” and “Progressives”, veganism is the least valid thing to be critiquing, and in fact, as you can see, being something that consists of work, of personal sacrifice to benefit others, it’s something that should be praised and celebrated, not a source of fuel for division. 


I’m not going to engage in comments as much as possible on this post. This is one of few spaces where I can discuss one half of my non-partisan self. Part of me is predicting that SOME of the responses to this are going to be very immature, basic-bitch, hyper-partisan, zero-brain-cell comments, and I don’t want to develop an extreme negative association with this sub. Please prove the part of me predicting this, wrong. 




GENERAL HEALTH AND LONGEVITY: 2009: The low-methionine content of vegan diets may make methionine restriction feasible as a life extension strategy https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18789600/



2019: In humans, certain healthy foods are associated with longer telomere length, and reductions in protein intake with lower IGF-1 levels, respectively, both relations being associated with longer lifespan. Furthermore, a high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and also coffee is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality whereas a high intake of (red) meat and especially processed meat is positively related to all-cause mortality. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31631676/



2020: There is substantial evidence that plant-based diets are associated with better health but not necessarily lower mortality rates. The exact mechanisms of health promotion by vegan diets are still not entirely clear but most likely multifactorial. Reasons for and quality of the vegan diet should be assessed in longevity studies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31895244/



2022: The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes, whole grains and nuts, and less red and processed meat. https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003889

GLOBAL HEALTH: Recently, the World Health Organization called antimicrobial resistance “an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society... Of all antibiotics sold in the United States, approximately 80% are sold for use in animal agriculture. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638249/





We find that, given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015




ENVIRONMENT: Results from our review suggest that the vegan diet is the optimal diet for the environment because, out of all the compared diets, its production results in the lowest level of GHG emissions. https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/15/4110/htm



This data shows that this is the case when we look at individual food products. But studies also shows that this holds true for actual diets; for example, researcher Vilma Sandström and colleagues studied the footprint of diets across the EU. Food transport was responsible for only 6% of emissions, whilst dairy, meat and eggs accounted for 83%.4 https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local




Thus, there seems to be an alignment of health and environmental outcomes for vegetarian diets. Although this shows the human health and environmental sustainability benefits of vegetarian diets in high-income countries, questions remain about the challenges in other contexts and the political will to promote meat-free diets as the social norm. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855976/



Global greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are twice those of plant-based foods https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00358-x




Further, for all environmental indicators and nutritional units examined, plant-based foods have the lowest environmental impacts; eggs, dairy, pork, poultry, non-trawling fisheries, and non-recirculating aquaculture have intermediate impacts; and ruminant meat has impacts ∼100 times those of plant-based foods. Our analyses show that dietary shifts towards low-impact foods and increases in agricultural input use efficiency would offer larger environmental benefits than would switches from conventional agricultural systems to alternatives such as organic agriculture or grass-fed beef. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5




Plant-based diets in comparison to meat-based diets are more sustainable because they use substantially less natural resources and are less taxing on the environment... The world’s demographic explosion and the increase in the appetite for animal foods render the food system unsustainable. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523048992",1,1731679476.0,JordanPeterson,0,1.0,False

Here I am, reading my magazines at the convenience store again. Well, pretending to, really. This corner of the 7-Eleven is where I have the best view of the intersection he always crosses every morning.

  I’m going to tell him good morning. I know I will. And who knows? Maybe we’ll even walk to school together!

  An intoxicating scent wafts by me just then. The clerk announces to the store, “Smoked arabiki sausage! Get it while it’s hot!”

7-Eleven is my weakness. Their snacks are just that good.

  Their arabiki sausage is all natural. You can tell by the texture and the way the casing pops when you bite into it. And don’t get me started on that smoky aroma. It stirs up an appetite like nothing else. And they’re not too heavy for a morning snack either.

  Usually they’re done earlier. They’re never fresh this late in the day.

  I still don’t see him, so I make a run for it. Of all the days for there to be a line at the register. It feels like forever before it’s finally my turn.

  “One smoked arabiki sausage, please!”

  “That’ll be 116 yen.”

  “I should have exact change.”

I open my wallet to check, and the automatic doors slide open. I hear his laugh. He’s waiting at the intersection with his friends.

  The light turns green.

  “No bag, please!”

  I take my sausage on a stick and try to put away my wallet, but I can’t. My hands are full. Every second I waste, he gets further away.

  I stuff the sausage into my mouth and run out the doors just as they start to close. (Author’s Note: Do not run with food in your mouth.)

  I have to say it.

  “***-kun, good mo—!”

  The sausage falls from my mouth, but I catch it in midair. The light turns red, and my shoulders fall. He’s long gone, laughing with his friends.

  Another morning without a “good morning.”

  My sausage didn’t taste quite as good after that.

I headed out home slightly earlier. On my way to school, I got a good position in the 7-Eleven convenience store’s eating corner. I’m trying to order more snacks at the cashier. If I choose a hotdog, he will leave before the staff member can finish heating it.

That’s why my conclusion is to buy riceball takoyaki.

Riceball takoyaki can be immediately consumed right after purchase. This way, I can immediately chase after him upon sight.

The roasted takoyaki with salty and sweet sauce and mayo is absolutely perfect. It tastes as good without heating.

Also, the milk foam of the hot latte I ordered tastes very good too. I’ve been completely attracted to it recently.

Someone seemed to have lined up behind me while I was listening to the coffee machine grinding the beans.

“Eh, Ako-san? I didn’t know you would drink something other than sweetened juice.”

The person who talks to me is my classmate XX-kun.

His mouth is ass. He always says things that piss me off.He’s holding a cup of iced coffee. Poor guy. He probably still doesn’t know how good a latte is, right?

I ignored XX-kun and looked outside the window.

I jolted. “He” and his friends are already waiting for the traffic lights at the crossroad.

I was utterly unaware because I thought I would be safe by heading out earlier.

I hastily tried to open the coffee machine’s lid, yet I couldn’t. It was automatically locked for safety purposes.

I could only stomp my feet around as I waited anxiously. At this time, I heard a “dododo” sound. The latte is finally ready.

Open the lid, pour the coffee, and close the lid. Done.

The traffic lights at the crossroad coincidentally turned green. I can still probably catch up if I’m quick.

I hastily dashed out of the automatic doors, but then I quickly headed back inside.

Indeed, I just remembered that I needed to add sugar.

During this time, XX-kun threw a pack of something at me. I caught it mid-air. It’s sugar. He must have noticed that I forgot to put it in, right?

However, I still returned to the eating corner like this.

“Ako-san, don’t you need sugar?”

I didn’t say anything and continued opening the coffee cup’s lid.

XX-kun, you won’t understand, anyway.

My principle is to put two packs of sugar in my latte…


Literature Club Report - Winter Edition <The Duel Has Just Begun?> by Anna Yanami:

I’m already in the 7-Eleven on my way to school early in the morning.

The speaker in the store is playing Christmas songs.

The decorations are already radiating Christmas vibes. However, everyone is so busy in the morning that they don’t have time to care about trivial things like this.

As usual, I occupied the food court by myself. However, someone called my name this time.

“Hey, Ako-san. You seem so chill today, you know?”

The guy trying to talk to me is XX-kun from the same class.

We aren’t that close.

“I’m just eating breakfast. Can you stop bothering me?”

My breakfast is a pork bun.

The meaty stuffing and chewy dough are extraordinary. I have to try it 5 times every week in winter.

XX-kun doesn’t seem to know where he’s heading. He looked in my direction and said, “Oh, I see.” What a smartass.

Outside the window, OO-kun is waiting for the traffic signal at the zebra crossing. A girl is standing next to him.

That’s Jko-chan.

She’s the girl who has been hanging out with him lately. I can see they are chatting happily.

Going to school with a guy in public, I think this is a little indecent.

XX-kun put a cup before me when I was eating my pork bun silently. 

It’s a hot latte, a large one also.

I glared at him because it blocked my sight. As for XX-kun, he sat down two seats away from me.

“Here. You like coffee, right?”

XX-kun didn’t say that loudly.

Come to think of it, it’s December 24th today. Is this a Christmas present?

Even though I don’t really like it, I’m not a girl who tramples on other people’s kindness.

The pork bun has already depleted the moisture in my mouth. A cup of hot coffee can soothe my body.

The coffee is thick, but there’s a refreshing taste of milk mixed within. This is delicious every time I try it.

”XX-kun, did you put sugar into this?”

“I did. Ako-san wants two packs of sugar, right?”

You can’t be helped. I sighed internally.

A large cup needs three packs of sugar.

However, a mature woman must not expose her emotions so easily.

The traffic light turned green. He and Jko-chan laughed and walked across the zebra crossing.

Seeing that, I can feel there’s an extra tinge of bitterness in my latte.


Literature Club Report - Special Edition <New Year’s Gift> by Anna Yanami:

I usually have breakfast in the convenience store.

One of my recent favorites in the rest area is charcoal grilled chicken skewers (salted). I don’t think I need to explain.

Those who are interested can look at the ingredients table. Yes, the row with carbohydrates.

Even though I don’t remember the actual numbers, it’s a champion because it’s so low.

Also, I’m having hot black coffee instead of a latte.

This is a champion for low values. That’s two champions in a row.

Convenience stores these days let you choose your coffee taste from “light” to “strong”, but it tastes especially strong today.

I stopped leaving my house early lately. That’s why I don’t see OO-kun going to school outside the window.

“Ako-san, you stopped eating meat buns these days, yeah?”

The person saying unnecessary things is my classmate, XX-kun.

We’ve been eating together in the corner recently.

Also, I used to eat pork buns. What an amateur.

He’s always sitting two seats away from me. How self-conscious. It’s disgusting.

Even though he doesn’t care about others in every way, he’s even meaner today. I can’t believe he’s having an American hot dog in the morning.

That’s right. The carbohydrates in a hot dog exceed 30 grams.

I want to eat that too.

Also, he just has to be drinking a latte instead of coffee today.

I want to drink that too.But I thought I could ask for a bite from him. Then, one of the girls from our school started talking to XX-kun.

The two whispered something to each other, and then, after a while, that girl took a bite of XX-kun’s hot dog before leaving.

…Even though I don’t know who that is, she’s such a greedy and despicable girl for wanting somebody else’s food.

XX-kun chuckled after I finished my skewers.

“Ako-san, are you still hungry?”This guy is as impolite as usual.

XX-kun gave me something when I was about to ignore him. It’s a yuzu pepper-flavored tofu stick.

One stick of this gives you 10 grams of protein. It’s pretty chewy as well.

“I think you’re trying to lose weight lately. Here’s a little snack for you.”

…This person is really impolite, after all.

I remembered that girl as I chewed on a tofu stick from another person.

Comparing a tofu stick to a bite of an American hotdog, I think I won here.

Although that’s how I feel, somehow, my heart is itching a little. It’s irritating…


Literature Club Report - Special Edition
<I Choose You> by Anna Yanami:

I'm standing in front of the usual convenience store.

But I can't go inside. The sign is down, and the windows are covered with sheets.

Someone spoke to me when I stared at the building.

“Hey, Ako-san. Did this convenience store close down?""

The clueless interloper is XX-kun. Oh dear, he knows nothing.

I saw them bringing new shelves into this building yesterday evening.

That means the convenience store will open again once the renovations are complete.

I took out 3 different types of boneless chicken from my bag after giving him a half-assed response.

XX-kun widened his eyes. My my, I know you won't understand.

The large sign along the road was also taken down, so a different chain store might move in once renovations are done.

That's why I got up early and bought boneless chicken from three different chains.

I plan to compare them and predict which chain will move in next.

Let's start with the first one.

When I bit into it, the aroma of spices filled my mouth. But the taste doesn't lose out, either. After the fragrance escaped through the nose, the meat's flavor spread throughout my mouth. Yes, this is the one I've decided on.

Though it's decided already, to be fair, I must also evaluate the second one.

The crunchiness upon the first bite is exhilarating. The juicy meat further boosted my already skyrocketing mood. This is it. It's decided.

But having said that, I must not let the third option cool down.

Despite its crunchy appearance, the finely textured breading danced on my tongue.

Each chew changes the texture and fragrance. It's bewitching, to be honest. This one is also a definite choice.

...Well, it seems I've decided on all of them.

Since I had no choice, I began planning a second round of evaluation, but XX-kun was staring at me.

Perhaps he wants some, too? How greedy of him.

However, since he always shares his food with me, I guess I should be kind occasionally.

XX-kun shook his head when I said he could take a bite.

""I'm not a fan of eating after someone else. I'll pass.""

What's with this guy? So rude.

Annoyed, I stacked the three pieces of chicken and took a big bite.

He's still watching me as I savor the feast fit for a king.

“Ako-san, where will you eat breakfast once this place closes?""

I'll eat at home.

Because the only reason I started coming here was to go to school with OO-kun, but now that he has started going out with Jko-chan, there's no reason for me to come here anymore.

But I kept feeling better and better upon seeing XX-kun's anxious look.

I ignored him and shoved the rest of the chicken in my mouth.

Let him be anxious. He'll understand everything once the new store opens.

[**Update**](https://new.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gr01di/update_my_husband_is_cheating_on_me_with_our_best/) **- 14th November 2024**

&#x200B;

**I recently found out that my husband 42 is cheating on me with our married best friend (32F). She is the godmother to our 4 children**

&#x200B;

They don't know that I know, but I caught them making out at the end of our driveway when he was seeing her off after dinner with our family. We live on a small acreage and the driveway is a long way off from the main house.

She had forgotten some crockery at the house and I decided to walk it over, because for some reason the two of them always took a while to say goodbye. (Now I know why!) That's when I saw them lit by her car's headlights. Making out in the front seat with our best friend straddling my husband.

In shock I didn't know whether to throw her pyrex at the car or just walk away.

I decided the latter, and was too shocked to cry or be angry.

When my husband got back, I had to pretend like everything was normal.

I know that it's stupid but I couldn't sleep that night and decided to go through his phone. She was obviously under a pseudonym but I found a handful of their messages dating 2 or 3 years.

Her husband doesn't know, he's currently posted overseas as a diplomat.

I'm sick with rage and betrayal. I'm lost and have no idea what steps to take next.

UPDATE: Woah didn't expect this much support. It's really overwhelming. Just to clarify a few things: This is a private account I created just for this post away from my usual account because I was scared it would be traced back to me. I want to remain anonymous as much as I can.

I don't live in the US - but in Australia. Technically, I can't file for divorce immediately - as you need to be separated for 1 year and 1 day to file officially.

My now ex best friend just recently returned to the country (her father has cancer) after being posted with her husband overseas. The dinner was to welcome her home - and what a welcome!

There's some comments here about the headlights illuminating them. Sorry I meant overhead lights.

As to what I'm going to do now - a part of me just wants to confront my husband, see what lame excuse he has. But I need to get away from him. This level of betrayal physically hurts. I can't help but think of all the times we spent together over the years and for how long our families were fooled. My mind is going crazy, when she was single and he would ""rescue"" her from some bad date or the times they were alone in my house when the kids and I were out. How irrationally angry he was when he found out she had a boyfriend then chose to marry him.

Thinking back on it, the two of them disappeared at her wedding. When I asked him where he was, he said he needed to reassure her that she had done the right thing. I feel so so sick thinking of these things.

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your concern and advice. As of tomorrow my husband is out of town. I've tried really hard to act normal around my now ex best friend but it's proving difficult and I feel sick. I have been telling both of them that I've caught some terrible bug and just not feeling myself.

While my husband is out of town for the next few days, my sister in law who is the only other person who knows (my brother's wife) will help me pack important documents - and store them somewhere my husband doesn't know about. I've organised for my kids to stay with them for a week while I sort my shit out. I've spoken to a family lawyer and they have told me that the best way to start the separation procedure is to no longer be living under the same roof.

I'm fortunate in that most of our assets are also in my name, and the land our house is on was gifted to us by my parents.

I'm planning to kick him out after his trip. But before that, I want to catch them both in the act again. Have some hard proof, send it to the ex friend's husband and get the ball rolling for moving on with my life.

I'll update with what happens after the confrontation.

FINAL UPDATE:

My husband came home two nights ago from his trip. While he was gone, I had organised a lot of the important documents eg. financial, birth certificates, passports, anything that he could potentially use to try and get more than what he deserves.

They are now safely stored and my kids have been staying with their Aunt and Uncle for the past few days.

I had packed all my husband's things and he has been really good at keeping his tracks clean because there was no evidence of his affair within his stuff. I placed all his belongings in the garage ready for the confrontation with him. I was super nervous because I wasn't sure if I was making the right decision. Once he came home and I remembered seeing him kissing our best friend - I remembered the deep hurt they had caused.

I was in our kitchen when he came home and he knew straight away something was wrong. During that week I had been distant and had barely answered his texts and screened his calls. I did answer every now and again and gave the kids a chance to speak to their Dad. He asked me why I hadn't been responding to his texts and he tried to kiss me but I turned away and before I knew it the first things that came out of my mouth were, I want a separation. I have to admit that he didn't look very surprised when I said it, he nodded his head and said, what do you know?

Which was just a punch in the gut, because I wanted to him to deny it or say something like it was a one off thing. I asked him to tell me everything, like when did it start? And he said they started about 10 years ago, at first it was flirtatious messaging and a sneaky kiss in the office when they briefly worked together and the affair was on and off. She apparently always felt guilty and her way out of that was to marry the next man that was interested in her and proposed. He admitted that they had sex on her wedding day and when he is out of town they meet. At this point I couldn't breathe and I was sobbing. I hated that the next words out of my mouth was, did you even ever love me? He hesitated and said yes of course but he was never in love with me the way he was with her.

I cleared my throat and had said to him that he should tell her husband - there is no point hiding it anymore. I told him that all his stuff was in the garage and he can find somewhere else to stay. I let him know that I have spoken to a family lawyer and I told him that when I feel ready and only when I feel ready will we see each other again and talk about the future arrangement with the kids. I said any further communication can be done through my sister in law or my brother. I said, he is allowed to see the kids but only at their place. I am of course wanting full custody of the children because it hurts too much to give him anything at this point.

He agreed to all my points because he knew he was in the wrong. He tried to say sorry and then I absolutely lost my shit and screamed, NO FUCKING NO WAY ARE YOU SORRY, FOR 10 FUCKING YEARS YOU HAVE BOTH DECEIVED EVERYONE WE KNOW. Please take your shit and leave and tell that woman you have been fucking for 10 years that I do not ever want to see her fucking face again.

Certainly not my shining moment but also a culmination of all the hurt and anger over the last few weeks that they have caused. I have no intention of talking to my ex best friend or really to my soon to be ex husband until I have had the time to grieve.

So thank you community for the encouragement and advice. Hope I can heal and move on from this.

**Update - 1 year later**

&#x200B;

Thank you everyone who has been messaging over the last year to see how I’m going and asking for an update. (Scroll below for the full story) It’s been a crazy, painful year. But our divorce has been finalised. And I’m free.

My ex husband and my ex best friend as no surprise are now in an actual relationship after the ex best friend’s husband found out about the affair. He divorced her, and since then we have met up for coffee to check in on each other and our mental health. He’s been great sending encouraging messages and he lives overseas and from his Facebook updates has started dating again. So I’m very happy for him!

The legal and custody battles had been fairly stressful but the ex husband agreed to all my terms the custody of the children was the only thing he really fought for. I have custody of the kids and he sees them on the weekends. The kids including myself have all been going to therapy separately. My ex husband wants to see them more and during school break the kids have the choice to stay with him or me. They have been good about it and stay with him for a week or so and then back to their mummy. Apart from necessary conversation I steer away from my ex husband and the ex best friend. It still hurts so much and I understand that it will take some time to heal. But I am letting go, because I don’t want them to have that level of influence over my life.

I decided to sell the property we were living in and move closer to family and friends because as you know, “it takes a village”. And I have been extremely grateful for the support I have received over the last year. I’m tearing up just as I’m writing this, knowing that I couldn’t go through all of this without my loved ones.

And for myself, I am happy overall, still a work in progress but grateful for life. The kids and myself have been enjoying life and when we have the time and the money try and take little trips here and there so the traumatic events of the divorce doesn’t linger and can be replaced by good memories. Memories where they spent road trips and adventures with their mum.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1grwypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1grwypt/sneomad/,SNEOMAD,"So yeah I made up that acronym because I'm doing: Steady, Non-Extreme OMAD.

Male, 45, 5 7"" stocky build.
CW: 165lbs (most fat is on my belly)

I grew up abusing alcohol, drugs and takeaways etc and now plan on sorting myself out. For the last few years (after giving up all my vices) I've sort of done OMAD most days but not a true fast as I drank tea/coffee with milk/sugar throughout the day.

For the last week and going forward my schedule is pretty much the following: 

22:2 fast

During the 2 hour eating window I start with coffee (sugar/milk) and handful of nuts. After that this is where the non extreme bit comes in. 

I'll eat within reason what I want. I don't do takeaways but a typical meal would look like, chicken/fish with rice or potatos, side salad and mixed vegetables. I'll have a bowl of cereal or some kind of desert like a slice of cheesecake and then maybe some more nuts. At weekends I'll likely have a cheat meal like a calzone or home made curry/rice etc. I'll still eat some biscuits or sweets within moderation over the weekend (during eating window) along with the odd iced coffee which I'm a sucker for.

Exercise spread throughout the week, (I exercise in the evenings before I break my fast)

2 gym sessions a week (1hr each of moderate cardiac work).
2 sessions of lengths in the pool (45mins moderate pace).

So my point being that I don't want to do the extremes of Keto or having super healthy meals and only one cheat meal once in a blue moon. After quitting all my vices (I don't drink alcohol/smoke or do drugs anymore) tasty food is my only guilty pleasure. I'm not looking for a 6 pack, just general health improvement and a borderline flat stomach.

I'll update this thread with my progress, just thought I'd make this post for those who may want to consider this lifestyle but also want to cheat a bit more than a lot of the paths I see others on. I'm curious as to if it'll work and if not I'll update with any changes I make.

Didn't Richard Newton say something the other day about starting to go through these in reverse? Is it possible that we're just getting started? I don't know! But what about that $30 test? Can we hold $30 if we test it? Will our bull trend stay intact? Let's take a look at our data and see what we can see:

**Price Movement Recap**

[11\/14 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/yo512me6x11e1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=f794f9bbd332ce822201e82722fd94f16a41d316)

Yesterday's trading once again fit to my projection: a much tighter trading range within our $26-$28 Gamma brackets that relied up on the 50-hour Simple Moving Average for its lower technical support and a wedgeform regression line for its upper bound. Respect of these upper and lower bounds were uncanny up until about 2:18  EST options flow shifted bullish carrying us up to $28, when at 2:32pm one of our largest options trades on the day came across the tape, reversing our downtrend back toward the 50-hour SMA and setting off a huge bullish options dogpile, laddering us up right into our Gamma hedge deadzone just above $28:

https://preview.redd.it/n9klg75bz11e1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=31d40597d8351faabebe8597917320cf9eebf14e

I'm not sure exactly who or what kicked off this run. While watching, it looked like a basic intraday reverse off of the moderately strong positive gamma position at $27. Options Traders did not immediately dogpile this reversal and, as you can see from my sketch of the wedgeform regression line above, the stock looked like it was going to reverse to the downside. 

I suspect this might have something to do with our price action on May 9, where in the final hour or so of trading the price spiked supposedly in algorithmic reaction to Keith liking a post on X. I was expecting perhaps something similar as sign that we were perhaps locked into the same algorithmic pattern and intending for a breakout up to $30 during Friday's trading. Traders, however, did not rush into the breach in sufficient numbers at the $28.50 and $29 Call strikes on our late day pop. Upward momentum stalled and then options flow flipped bearish perhaps with some conventional shorting to carry us back down to a close within our earlier range. 

Nevertheless, Options premiums ended the day bias moderately bullish and OTM options contracts (such as the $30 calls) were down approximately 50% on the day, making them potentially appetizing pick-ups should funds/algorithms/traders try to pump the stock today for that $30 test.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Our Max Pain strike for today is still at $22, however, we can see notably that our 11/22 strike has elevated to $22 as well as a result of yesterday's trading:

https://preview.redd.it/egles1ut021e1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=87c89578f1dff97b6e4e6abde372880da388cd7d

Our later expiries still show elevated Max Pain values, including every December expiry, at $23. This indicates that traders are still building out new OI, both Puts and Calls, significantly closer to our current trading range versus our lower range in the August to October period.

But what about our prospects for a run today? What about that $30 run or breakout? It looks like a fair number of traders redeployed capital to account for this eventuality yesterday:

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/14-11\/15](https://preview.redd.it/26iv00am121e1.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=c446ea269d42de86aa84b52fcf8c739c6fe717bf)

This is the exact OI shift pattern I've been looking for to signal the structural possibilities of continued upward momentum. We see both new Call and Put OI shifting upward and all of it 1DTE! Plenty of the new Calls especially were bought at the ASK yesterday and Puts sold at the BID. The $34 Calls for example:

[These long call traders did not exit this position yesterday on our $28+ spike even though they had the perfect entry to capture that value on the day! A 100&#37; Gain which they didn't take profits on.](https://preview.redd.it/43osif7d221e1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f22bb9b878f60ab78c0e89c9463ae4b6c703ae4)

And the $25 Puts:

[At the Bid! A killer trade so far by percentage. Whoever is still holding these 1000+ new contracts opened yesterday things he or she will squeeze out the last $6k-ish out of these today and that we will close above $25.](https://preview.redd.it/o66fdwqv221e1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb1836bdc247f8643ae9543676065073d4188c08)

In general 11/15 net Call Premiums were bullish, at the ASK, with strikes $31-$34 our most bullish:

[Call Strikes $22-$35](https://preview.redd.it/en9d08e9421e1.png?width=91&format=png&auto=webp&s=acc9573524fa2c8898f6790558eb33a7136bafc9)

11/22 Has also started to show some meaningful new OI accretion:

[11\/22 OI Changes 11.14-11\/15](https://preview.redd.it/p3e9qbvp421e1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=548c5a1af65e90a95184fa6529a2ddad3056bc27)

New Puts were light, but new Calls were pronounced, especially at $26 which was almost entirely at the ASK, as was our $35 strike. $28 and $30 were about evenly mixed.

Most OI changes farther out were minor, except for some extremely far OTM Calls sold for January ($95s) from traders eager to sink their teeth into these high IV levels.

**Gamma Exposure**

Our daily Put/Call GEX ratio trended bullish again with yesterday's OI modifications:

https://preview.redd.it/ds8fhvtw621e1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa0a8d1be3db0bcf8668cf361e055f123c61586

That's right we're back to .20 (1 point of Put Gamma Exposure for every 5 points of Call Gamma Exposure) from what was a .23 ratio premarket yesterday (these figures I believe get revised based on opening price, which is why we see it listed as .21 here). From these figures alone - that new 250k+ Call Gamma - we are still projected to enjoy stable trading conditions into today's intraday session.

And, yes, most of that new Gamma looks like it is concentrated on today's expiry, lining up with our OI data:

https://preview.redd.it/2rbcepkm721e1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=39081b6eb77646fd53a446066960fbb7331b4e80

I wanted to present our Daily GEX in two phases today to illustrate why I am confident that we will see continued stable trading conditions with a continuation of our bullish trend into the coming weeks:

https://preview.redd.it/z53fhrrw821e1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c106ba001a8ffeed83118cbfcc94bac7cc4bdf2

The Blue area illustrates why $25 is our deep floor. There is effectively \*no\* Market Maker gamma exposure at these strikes. Whatever contracts are still open at these strikes, they are effectively 100% hedged and MM's assess the probability of their ITM closure to be >95% at minimum on the highest strike ($24.50). For our short term considerations, that is into today's trading, this range is no longer meaningful for forecasting price movement. Only something absolutely catastrophic - 10s of Millions of concentrated selling, Ryan Cohen is hospitalized or something - could this probability of stability be jeopardized.

So let's look at our more proximal strikes:

https://preview.redd.it/xs83oytaa21e1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eb1f6892e9185e31618a7b6dedf59d28ae60cc8

We can see how new Call GEX has begun to insert above $30 and has meaningfully thickened up at $27.50, $28, and $29 as a result of our small run around 2:30pm yesterday. These upper strikes will provide a bit of pull during the today's trading if we get a run up toward $30. The size and strength of our $28 strike - now our 2nd largest net Call GEX position - has the potential to serve now as a support if it can be claimed during premarket or intra price action. The thickness of $27.50 also creates a comparatively smooth and consistent hedging flow if traders/institutions should sell us down to $27 with the intention of launching a small gamma run off of that strike as they did yesterday. $28.50 and $29 also now host enough Call Gamma to stabilize our trading above $28 and mitigate the effects of the hedging 'deadzone' we've kept smacking into on all of our bull runs this week. 

As far as Market Maker short strategies for 11/15, I expect that they will abandon attempts to push the stock under $25. This strike is 1) too far out of range and too embedded at the bottom of Call-Gamma-thick range to claim and hold even with Charm value loss. Again, it would require a huge amount of short volume through Bearish options flow to achieve that they might not be able to coordinate. 2) With IV values so high, they will start RAKING in profits from wayyyy OTM contracts that are only 60DTE. MMs are selling $100 Calls for 1/17 at a premium of $2 per share - that's $200 PER contract! Exactly 3 weeks ago they were selling $25 Calls for the same price!!!!

Thus, as far as our gamma hedging structure goes, a $30 test today is absolutely in play. 

A $30 breach and hold? That would be a MM code red. T+1 Settlement explosion on Monday if that happens. They will jack up IV into the 200% to cover their losses on such an event. Low likelihood of occurrence, but if there is a bullish options onslaught today - $100mil in total premiums with a decent bullish skew, it's not impossible.

Here are our my charts from yesterday, where I specifically drew attention to this wedgeform, stepwise pattern in our current uptrend. As I mentioned above, we scrupulously observed support and resistance with respect to these trendlines during yesterday's trading. Our late day run effected the following transformation of our current period's wedge, however:

[10\/25-11\/15 4hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/pff458t0h21e1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe30642b2b96bda6ec841343630d04d621cee6c)

Yesterday's $28.25 candle pushed the upper regression line on our wedgeform shape into a flatter angle. A move to $29 today approximately would make the angle about as flush as that from our May 9-10 shape (above). This may mean we don't go forward with a test of $30 today, but a day of elevated price action relative to yesterday seems a likely minimum with our bigger 'step-up' breakout candidate pushed to Monday.

A scenario on the 1-hour timeframe might look something like this:  


[10\/25-11\/15 1hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/t5d93otzf21e1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf00c2eee5ddaab0a940ba8912041b02ebbe012)

I'll also repost yesterday's weekly-chart May/November comparison:

[GME 2024 YTD 1-Week Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/4f7rr3y8i21e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=29de10aa91699648ea2b2306cf9f7db55877fefc)

So far, these technical paradigms are still in place. We have not overextended our price level with respect to RSI (Relative Strength Index) and we are still looking quite similar to the patterns exhibited during the lead up to our May event. We still differ from that context in that we are right before a monthly OPEX, which was not the case when this pattern emerged before the May run, but this might not matter. That price run was also supposedly driven by algorithmic reactions Keith's return to Twitter/X. 

I'm not saying I have evidence for one causal explanation or another. I'm noticing these differences and not over-committing to a 1-for-1 repeat of the May scenario despite the possibility that it unfold.

**IV Trends**

I've maxed out images for the post with my extra charts and GEX examples, so suffice to say that IV has trended up. I've already talked a bit about it upstairs. MMs are continuing to jack up IV levels in order to profit from farther OTM Calls for upcoming expiries. With Put volume at a minimum and our bullish trending sending tens of thousands of new Calls into the money every day, they are adjusting IV in order to account for losses on ITM bets.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

With all our data combined, we look primed to trade in a $27 to $30 range today. If we can claim $28 (which we already look to have done in premarket trading) and hold it intraday, the set-up is in place to see an intraday test of $30. It is possible to see some kind of fake-out drop toward $27 off the open that reverses back to the middle of the $27-$30 range quickly and could result in a particularly explosive rebound based on our Friday Charm dynamics and their influence on MM hedging. 

We are looking at a most likely close below $30, but on the off chance that some funds are ready to commit capital to Call strikes above $30 in large numbers in order to stabilize our price action above this level, this could result in major breakout next Monday. We'll need to watch carefully to see how this plays out. So much as always depends on how much capital is committed. If any of these scenarios play out, it will spell a continued, intact bull trend that still, day-to-day, shows no signs of stopping. 

Let's see what happens! Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. Today's coffee (and this week's) is still brought to you by the generosity of 'firm-necessary.' I've had a lot of generous coffee donations over the past few days and weeks who I have had the pleasure of giving shoutouts - I'll be sure to revisit everyone who was generous enough to donate as I drink your coffees! Thank you friends :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

I really like light roasts with fruity flavours and make milk drinks exclusively, so not concerned about espresso body. 

I currently use a kingrinder k6 with flair 58 and underextract almost all my shots so theyre very sour and try my best to completely avoid bitterness. There's always abit of bitterness but the sourness never comes through after adding milk. However, I usually get pretty generic tasting coffee and sometimes can't discern between two light roasts. 

This is a big reason I bought the 064s. 

I'm wondering which SSP burr I should get for high clarity. From what I've read the 064s produces more traditional espresso, with more body, less clarity but I assume the flat burrs will still produce more clarity than my K6 but I can't find any comparisons.

There I tasted some of their coffee’s and bought a bag of their Ciele Rojo Gautemala. On their website they have brewing recommendations which were very helpful for me as a beginner. 

I warmed up my GCP and portafilter with a 20gr VST basket. Prepped my beans by grinding in Timemore C3 chestnut on click 8. Wdt, tap and level tamp put a 1mm puckscreen. Temp surfed the gaggia and engaged the steam button for 7 seconds. Pre infused with the steam knob for 5 and pulled a 19.4 in 41.8 out shot in 32 seconds. Recommendations for this one are 19.5 in 43 out in 29 seconds. I’m really happy with the result on first try. When I get my DF 54 back I’m gonna try get closer to the recommendation with my grind but the result was all ready really good.

If any of my active RP partners see this: I’m not replacing anyone. **You are awesome and I value you highly!**

To everyone else: *Hi, nice to meet you!*



**Introduction**

I’m Luc, a 24 y/o from Central Europe, looking for an additional RP partner around my age. I am looking to create a strong, longterm connection and build an interesting story with you.



 **A few KEY requirements**

* You’re somewhat **literate** and have **good grammar**.
* You don’t just write one- or two-liners but if you put **effort** into your paragraphs.
* You’re willing to role-play on **Discord**.
* You're open to put effort into getting to know each other, **OOC**.
* You’re a **communicative** RP partner, we make decisions together.
* You’re okay with writing in **past 3rd tense**.
* You’re looking for a **slow-burn**, **longterm** RP.
* You’re **patient** (My life’s quite busy, I don’t get to write that often. But when I do, I put a lot of effort in and I value everyone who can respect that.)



**Some ideas to get the creative juices flowing:**

I’m strongly looking to add a realistic SOL slowburn romance plot to what I’m currently writing on. A few ideas I have would be:

* **Friends-to-Lovers**: After a rough breakup, a dedicated student asks their best friend to be their „fake date“ to events to avoid awkward encounters with their ex. But as they start playing the role of a couple, lingering feelings and unexpected sparks blur the line between friendship and love. Things get complicated when the ex tries to worm back into their life, stirring up old jealousy and confusion.
* **Friends-to-Lovers**: Two childhood friends make a pact that if they're both single by the time they turn 21, they'll go on a date. As the birthday approaches, one friend starts dating someone new, leaving the other grappling with feelings they didn’t realize were there. The tension mounts when meddling friends and family pick up on the unspoken feelings, pushing them to confront what’s been right in front of them all along.
* **Strangers-to-Lovers**: Both night owls, two students keep running into each other during late-night study sessions at the library. What starts as an awkward series of encounters turns into quiet conversations, shared coffee breaks, and exchanged study tips. Their connection deepens as they find solace in each other’s company, but as final exams approach, both are unsure if the other feels the same way, and friends insist on playing „matchmaker“ to get them out of their shells.
* **Enemies-to-Lovers**: Two students with completely opposite personalities, one very academic, the other a laid-back party-goer, are forced to share a dorm room after a mix-up in administration. Their clashing lifestyles create tension, and both of them can’t stand the other’s habits. But when a campus event puts them on the same team, they start seeing each other in a new light. Old flings and new rumors create additional hurdles.

I’m very much open to any ideas you might have.


So, if you’ve read this far without clicking away: **Thank you!** If you have any other ideas, please feel free to tell me about them, I look forward to your message via PM or DM. If your message just says «I’d love to RP» or «Interested», I probably won’t get back to you, but if you cook up a somewhat literate response and maybe also write a couple of sentences about yourself and your writing habits, I’m more likely to be interested. :)

See you soon,

***Luc***

1grwey1,https://v.redd.it/ixkyc2r8i21e1,Help diagnosing a poor flow issue,"Hey folks,

Hoping someone may help me diagnose this issue that started happening a day ago. As you can see from the video I am getting very poor flow through the group head. 

This is my first espresso machine and I am not massively knowledgable. Here is what I’ve tried so far: 

- Backflow clean using espresso machine cleaner and blanking disc. 
- Descaling using the Gaggia descaler - I actually couldn’t complete this due to the poor flow through the group head. 
- Dismantled and cleaned shower screen and group head.

The next step according to the below guide is to take the boiler out and check the solenoid valve for blockage (I don’t feel comfortable doing the step to check the coil). Before I do this, does anyone have any other advice that I can try first that’s less risky?

Looking to replace my Mac book pro with the first M1 chip (purchased in 2020). My son spilled an entire xl dunkin coffee and there was no saving it. RIP. 

Considering switching to an air since the newer chips are likely to be an improvement no matter what, but wanted to ask the experts. 

I think the pro might be excessive for my use cases. I’m generally running slack/discord/spotify, fellow, zoom, software for coding (very minor, only html), and occasionally a VM for a company I contract with (Amazon workspaces). Everything else is browser based. 

That should all be doable with an air, right? I’m currently trying to cut it with a chrome book and an iPad for what I can’t run on chrome and it’s clunky at best and unusable at worst so it’s not a reasonable or sustainable set up. And if I can save money going with the air, I’ll put that money toward other wfh improvements like a standing desk.

I'm the heaviest I have ever weighed (being overweight my entire life). I'm young, and I want to feel happy about myself. I have seen the beginners guides for electrolytes and magnesium and such but I just don't quite understand it. Please be kind when I ask these questions. I'm really uneducated and also don't want to hurt myself or my body while doing this, while also having all of this information for me in one place. 

The goal I want to jump right into is a 4 day Fast. I'm very routine oriented when it comes to making changes like this in my life. Is that wise or silly of me to have such a large fast as a first? I've gone days without food before... But a long long time ago. Maybe 1 or 2 days. I plan to do this weekly. The 5th day being a slow reintroduction back into food and my two days off of work being at my recommended calorie limit. 

I plan on dirty fasting at least at the start. I love my diet sodas (intake of those will be cut down drastically during this process), I love my low carb monster energy drinks (I hope to man up soon and drink black coffee but I guess I want to prove to my brain that during the start of my fasting journey, it doesn't have to be hell for me). I definitely need to drink more water in general and will need to drink even more when fasting. 

Now, about the electrolytes and magnesium. How much should I take or how do I go about finding how much I need? What's your favorite way of obtaining both? Personal favorite brands? 

And lastly (as far as I think as creating this post), advice? What to avoid? How to make it more bearable at the beginning of possible? I've read a lot and forgot a lot so I'm open to any advice that can be given. Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really hope to finally be able to stick to something. I pray this is it.

Art did his best to follow Jack’s advice that evening as he dutifully transcribed the Sorrow Hound’s tale. While it was true that focusing on the horrific story blotted out the images of the even more ghastly crowd in attendance, Arthur found himself thinking more about his role in this than he had in some time.

He had fallen into the habit of pretending that he was nothing more than a conduit, an empty pipe for the stories to flow through. This was not entirely untrue, but it was worth remembering that pipes were not unaltered by their contents. They were left sticky, stained, corroded and clogged. Roots broke in and used the pipes for their own purposes. Things leaked out.

Arthur tried to recall his terror upon first seeing the gathered Gentlefolk. He could only remember his descriptions of it, the story he had told himself. He could not recreate the involuntary attempt of his body to run. He could not feel the sharp prick of Jack’s knife at his side. He did not experience the blinding horror of the assembled insanity, the hunger of their regard, their need for his vitality. He only had the words for it, which were pale echoes of the sensations themselves.

And this last meeting? Certainly he was still revulsed by their presence, as any living thing would be. He recoiled from them in the same way that one would pull their hand away from a hot stove. But he did not fear them, and he certainly did not fear their stories. He had even come to look forward to them. They were freeing. They gave him fertile ground in which to write, to express himself, to find his voice. They gave him confidence. And they gave him an audience.

He had undoubtedly grown as a writer. What had it done to him as a person, though? How corroded had he become, how much of his humanity had already leaked out by serving as their pipeline to the world?

The man—the Fleshraiser, the Whispering Man had called him—seemed to believe that it was already too much. The horror in his eyes had not lessened as he looked upon Art. If anything, it had grown greater. A nightmare being monstrous was simply to be expected. A human being becoming so was far worse to see.

In the beginning, Arthur had often thought about leaving. It had always been images of Jack’s knives that kept him then, fear of agony and death if he did not obey. He had not thought of quitting in some time, though, and now that he was again considering it, it was not the knives he feared. It was the loss of the stories.

He read over what he had written about the Sorrow Hound’s tale. It was the story as he had received it, but it was undoubtedly his version of the story. His flourishes were present, his idiosyncracies, his focus on character and voice. Pieces of Arthur were clear throughout the story, as they were for all of the stories he recorded for the Society.

If he was putting pieces of himself into the tales, then surely the tales were replacing those pieces in return. Thaddeus had been human once, in the same position that Arthur was now in. Now he collected deadly objects, absorbing them into himself to become ever larger and less human. The Society had done that to him. It would do it to Arthur, too.

Arthur shook his head. He did not have to let it corrupt him. He could fight back. All he had to do was to be human. Aggressively, boringly human.

He texted Nettie.

*Bit of a pivot here but, how about a normal date Tuesday night? Coffee, sit-down dinner, dessert?*

Her response was swift:

*If you’re sure enough! I told you, I have thoughts on local bars and restaurants.*

He was typing a response when a second text came in:

*Before you ask, I’m not picking the place. This is a test.*

Arthur smiled and deleted his message asking that very thing. Instead, he wrote:

*I’ll sort it out. Meet you there again or pick you up?*

*You’re not getting my address yet,* Nettie wrote. *But I’ll meet at your place and we can go from there.*

A date. Nothing out of the ordinary, no gifts gleaned from the Gentlefolk. Just two people having dinner at a restaurant, finding happiness and companionship in each other’s presence. It didn’t get more peacefully human than that.

On the other hand, Arthur now had a date to plan. He could feel the nerves gathering as he mentally sifted through all of the restaurants he knew, trying to use what he knew of Nettie to figure out which ones she would like and dislike. The food would be the least relevant part, he thought. As long as it was well-made, he suspected she enjoyed a variety of cuisines. The ambiance was much more important. The lighting, the setting, and especially the people. Nettie was very much a people person.

Arthur smiled despite his nervousness—or rather, because of it. He could feel it. His pulse had quickened. His muscles were slightly tensed. He cared about this. It wasn’t a story he was telling himself. He was living it, and it mattered. He was still alive.

He was still human.

When Arthur came home from work Tuesday evening, Jack was nowhere to be found. Instead there was an ornate samovar with two matching cups set on a tray on the counter. There was no smell of coffee in the air, but a small card bore clear instructions in Jack’s neat handwriting explaining how and when to brew the coffee. Arthur had no doubt that if he followed the directions, the results would be as sharply precise as everything else Jack did.

In his bedroom, Arthur found that Jack had also laid out a shirt and pair of slacks. Arthur, who had thought that his general office attire would be good enough, still recognized a hint when he saw one. He cleaned up, changed and returned to the kitchen to follow the directions on the samovar.

Arthur was just setting the tray on the table when Nettie knocked on the door. She looked stunning, and Arthur was glad to have changed. He would have looked not underdressed, but rather undercommitted, which was far worse. As it was, they matched well, even down to complementary colors in their clothing. Arthur wondered how Jack had managed that. Perhaps it was only a coincidence, and Arthur was giving him too much credit. Somehow, though, he didn’t think so.

“Ooh, we look good together,” said Nettie, giving Arthur a brief kiss as she entered. His hand lingered on her back as her gaze swept around his apartment, taking it all in. “You really do have a butler, don’t you?”

“You don’t think I could keep things this tidy?”

“I don’t think showrooms can be kept this tidy. There’s no way this isn’t a full-time job for someone. Did he make the coffee I smell, too?”

“I made the coffee.” Arthur pictured Jack’s raised eyebrow at the implied theft of credit and amended his statement. “Following his instructions.”

He led Nettie to the couch and poured her a cup of coffee from the samovar.

“That’s a beautiful piece. Is it from Duat?”

“Where?” Arthur poured himself a cup as well.

“The antique shop we visited last week.”

Arthur nearly spilled coffee on himself. “I sincerely hope not.”

Nettie cocked her head to the side, examining his reaction. “I thought you liked that place.”

“I just…wouldn’t want to drink from something from there.”

“Because it’s so rare and valuable, you mean?” Nettie’s wry smile said that she would not trust any answer she was given. “You haven’t lied to me yet, Arthur, but you keep an awful lot hidden.”

“Says the woman who won’t even tell me where she lives.”

“Soon, I think.”

“Waiting for me to tell you my secret first?”

Nettie laughed. “You may never do that. For now, I’m just waiting to see how this dinner goes. The coffee is a good start.”

Called off my engagement, what was the right call here?

To give those perspective readers an idea of our background:

 My ex fiance and I have always had a decent dynamic. Charismatic, dancing in the kitchen, craft nights, cozy nights in. I moved in with her after 8 months and figured it would be good, I was helping take care of a pup (Maya) she committed to when we first started dating. She was all in. She helped me with a vehicle and bought it outright about 4 months in... Ill bring that up again later. While living together I was running a landscaping company and we would go on adventures to get bags and so on. I graduated my Masters at the time and opened a clinic in a town nearby where I was renting before. I had this space prior to dating. This was a hard year for me where I was travelling so much and trying to get the business going. We decided to look at homes nearby and she helped clear me of some of my debts so we could have a clean bill. We even signed promissory notes and did it officially. 

There was talk of engagement with the house... although I never wanted that to be a reason that we did. There were some nights my partner would scream at me when I came home to her place...It didnt make me feel safe in place and communication in the beginning was weird. even an event where she paid for gas once and then because she did that she didnt have to help with chores at my mothers cottage ( thank god it was just us two). Some entitlement with money. 

When we found the perfect home I told her parents I was considering proposing and asked permission.... then during the house buying process I felt very alone. She wasnt there till we couldnt sell and had to refinance. She then started gaslighting me under the stress I presume...It was very hard. Due to this I decided to not propose right away. I respectfully told her parents while we move in I will eventually but needed some time. They were excited of course but didnt like this. They proceeded to go behind my back and ask her why I was holding off when she didnt know anything which ended up with us going to counselling for 5 months...She also asked for money back for the vehicle she said was okay not to pay back then out of anger. We were gaining respect and rebuilding communication again with counselling. I then decided to wait a few more months and proposed in our own backyard after I landscaped it! 

I was spending alot of time with work and with some other business people ( some woman ) and she didnt like the late nights although I communicated. I respected her boundariies and met with people for coffee instead... After proposing we had a good couple of months but then noticed some irritating behaviour on her part...We went away on a camping trip and I planned the whole thing, adapted the schedule to her and there were moments where she didnt talk to me. Prior to that in the February we went to Philippines and she didnt talk to me for a whole afternoon because I was working "" but I own a business and needed to do something"" we weren't doing much but being besides the pool. 

She also has this thing about returning the vacuum home from my business and the day we were going to Spain I hurt mayself, bad. She decided that instead of sympathizing she would scream at me when I couldnt move my head because I didnt get some landscaping done and bring the vaccum back... I paid for the whole trip to make up for my debt leading into Janaury I had blood clots ( inconclusive) and I was looking to her for support and she was not really there, said it would get better, and it got worse...admitted myself to hospital and felt like she didnt give me the love I needed.... only after hearing from my neighbour about how is gf was calling doctors to help him come to his MS diagnosis when it occured...and helping him along the path..I hate comparing but I did. 

She then went away for an police course for 2.5 months. I was left with our house, pets, and business. She would come home and say things like "" back from vacation "" we got into an argument over the mortgage which she contributed a big chunk to and proceeded to call me a "" renter in her home "" and also said about my work that "" if i was your mother and your dad worked as much as he did I would of taken everything from him as well like she did"" ....bad overshadowing.... 

She made me jealous of a guy there by spending time with him, having him change her tired for her instead of asking me. She said to me on a date I organized that he gave her this weed pen "" that he didnt want to say it in front of me that it made him horny when he uses it, and asked me if that was weird..."" IM like yeah for sure it is. 

Towards the end of her course I wanted to revisit our conversation. I was struggling with a friend of mine who called off his bachelor I had organized and randomly she said during easter that "" my aunt thinks that you are out of my league... "" I reassured her that she was not accurate and that she was equally amazing as a person. 

We went to revisit the conversations from before because they were bothering me and it was a friday from her coming home. She didnt say anything to me after asking about my mental health and me explaining some thoughts about the argument through messenger. We had a civil night, not close, not apart kind of thing. We got into it the next day and she told me "" your mood was so low that I was happier when you werent home"" I was crying....the most fucked up thing to say I thought and groveled. 

In the coming weeks I had paid for another trip to Guatemala to again repay debts and celebrate her.... but the argument and that reaction bothered me alot... I told her that I thought I couldnt make her happy after being alone for 2.5 months at home...she explained that she felt alone and that I didnt react enough to her memes or reels during her time away ( i did call her and she didnt say anything in these late calls and then would hang up on me or me her ) I felt I did try, it was really awkward honestly. 

Leading to our trip she sent me a reel "" how to love your wife properly "" something in me snapped. I said that she has no perception of the way people receive things when she says them that she can be abrasive and cruel. That I was not excited to get married after just putting a deposit down on suit. 

I had a counselling session alone to figure it out and we decided to go on the trip....we had a really good 1 day. Then it blew up....we argued and I told her that she has put me in such a position to feel so alone and disrespected ...she even said "" I wouldnt want to marry me either""  We did a counselling session with our person there... it was tense and uncomfortable but tried to enjoy the rest of the trip. She made a list of the things that she could improve...and I said I would think about it and just wanted to enjoy our hike up to this volcano....she didnt like that and made comments like "" would you date so and so"" She took a photo of herself and said "" For my tinder profile"" and then "" how long would it take you to date again"" very confusing and weird for me. At the top of the volcano she asked to be intimate and we did...very odd. 

  
For the rest of the trip we made the most of it and had an okay time...when we got back I just wanted to unload so the same day because our flight was early I went to Toronto to talk to my friends. The next day she told me when I got back that her and Liam ( ex ) had a conversation....I did ask details. I was really hurt by that as it seemed spiteful. 

She called me while I was at the cottage, meanwhile me talking to my Mom, sister and brother in law about what to do and how I was so lost in this mess of our situation ( my sister had been talking to us while we were away so she had an idea! They thought a lot of it was disrespectful. 

We were in limbo for about a week before I asked her to see her list and talk think about it. We decided to do counselling. Which resulted in me seeing the messages to the ex. It was a super comfortable conversation. She wasnt flirting but he was making her feel good and when this came up she said she would stop ( previously ), When i saw the messages it said "" Sorry I am in trouble and cant speak to you, you wouldnt of known blah blah blah....victim. We had a few fights in between counselling and yelling matches. She even at one point said maybe there are other homes.... but mentioned she wanted to stay. She even during one of our fights was on her phone during one of our conversations and was crying. 

In counselling we worked on talking to each other and she highlighted that my ex had emotionally abused me and that also her words were harsh....my ex of course thought she was taking a beating. In the weeks onward we worked on forgiveness and I told her I did. 

SPICY : 

I dont know if it was destiny but in the time we were kind of working on it my neighbor I had never met had a conversation about her property to me. She showed me her home, took me around, and so I started to see if I would qualify....we did. We put in an offer and got accepted for way less. 

This was a hard conversation to have but we did....she cried and said "" I cant believe this is our reality"" We had a night of cuddling once.... I always felt that my door was open for her and she could come in at any time and speak to me if she wanted to but she never really did.... 

  
She even did a walk  through and asked to come see the new place. Later that night though she told me she was dating.... which was hard to hear. I took it as spite. Its now been 4 weeks since that moment. I was sad when I moved out and even wrote her a bunch of vulnerable messages saying we could work it out. She is done imo.... and honestly it feels like she didnt really want it. 

  
I am going no contact as much as I can but she does reach out for silly stuff. I moved nearby and our neighbors are all close so it will be hard but eventually I think in time it will be okay. 

  
Please give me your take on this situation. I feel she didnt want it honestly and was stressed by the situation. ",4,1731676804.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1grw3r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1grw3r5/i_really_enjoyed_the_friendlyjordies_show_in/,I really enjoyed the FriendlyJordies show in Melbourne tonight.,"Long time lurker, I believe my* first time posting* to the sub. Been watching FJ and also JS on YouTube for years now and finally got myself a couple of tickets to the Melbourne show earlier tonight.

He's a great performer, really leans in to the heckling (when it's legible but don't take this as an invitation to heckle a performer on stage - ever - unless it's really relevant or you've got a total zinger, then I think the rules are a bit more relaxed).

Anyhow;

I went in completely blind to the content, I didn't read previous reviews or the synopsis, that's just how I prefer to see new things (bands and movies too). All I knew was the title  'a call to Neck beards' and I thought it would be a rant about neck beards, and I was very pleasantly surprised. 

Aaaaand. It was great. Very funny. My ESL partner said his strong Australian accent was hard to understand at some points, but when he's making fun of the dare ice coffee type of person, the legibility doesn't really matter, we know who he's ripping on. Even though her English is maybe at 97% she understood most of what he was saying, she also went in blind after I roped her in with a few videos and she also loved it. I think the stereotype for his audience is nerdy redditors or people super into auspol, and stereotypes do exist for a reason, but there was a decent mix of people with minimal stereotypical presence. 

I try not to spoil much about the show in case there are others like me who enjoy going to shows blind, I just wanted to share that my partner and I both had a great time and were thoroughly entertained, and in true jordies fashion it was honestly very very thought provoking and cleverly structured to loop all his topics to make a full circle.

 Thinking more and more of his throwaway lines, and so many actually do have an onions worth of layers to them. And not in a way that I was expecting and not in a way that I could have anticipated the significance of. Think beyond the usual auspol injections into his rhetoric, but on a grander scale. 

Honestly, a 10/10 and 10s are exceedingly rare on my list.

I don't know if he (or you jordan, yes I'm talking to you now in case you actually are here, stalking) reads the sub or is active here, but if he is. I just want him to know that I'm grateful for opening my eyes to so many things in life, and not just in your career as friendly jordies, but also in your career as Jordan Shanks. To quote something you said earlier tonight.. 

 ""thank you for being you""

The flair seemed the most relevant from the option. Reviews are often to be found somewhere in a newspaper.

For dry, dehydrated skin, hydrating facials use products rich in moisture to replenish and soothe the skin, leaving it soft and plump.

I usually fill the cup 2/3 with boiling water, brew for 3 minutes (in know 5 minutes is optimal but I can't wait that long), then just top it off with cold water. Instant drinkable tea, no patience required. I know exactly how much cold water to put in for the perfect drinking temperature.

I was on a coffee date recently, did my little cooling trick on my black coffee, and... she looked at me like I’d just poured ketchup on cake. She was absolutely shocked, like, “You’re *watering down* your coffee?!” I told her, “Uh, coffee is literally already watered-down coffee.""

My dad used to put his tea cup in a bowl of cold water so he wouldn’t have to ""water it down"" but still cool it off but that never made sense to me.

I'm 24 yo man , I have been looking for a job since I graduated this summer (English degree) but no results whatsoever I tried different job application from sending my CV to companies to looking for regular jobs like sales man in clothing storesp. What I v realised that these companies looking for French and English speakers since I m not good English speaker I never get a job, I decided to look for normal and regular jobs but also no results, tried private schools and all they say is we will call you back and they never do , I kinda lost hope and at the same time I don't wanna depend on my parents money bc they got a financial crisis last several months all I got now is 100 dt that they gave me. i don't wanna sound weak but I am lowkey desperate for getting money even for the smallest amounts . 
Can you guys give me some applicable proven ideas on how to invest those 100dt to get some money and maybe snowball it .
Even if it is 20 dt per day It would be ok 
(Didn't want to mention working in coffee shop bc Iam allergic to smoking I had breathing issues this summer bc of molded walls near the area I live in, and that irritated all my allergies.. So I had to leave my town and live by myself, all I got is 15 days to repay the rent but like I v mentioned I got 0 money) 
I sound like am all over the place, as you can tell, I am not that focused..)

A big part of my job is managing the calendars and client accounts for our sales team. I don’t know much about sales or the industry we are in (floral sales) but I was eager to learn to help diversify my skill set.

When I met the sales manager in January, I liked him. He was kind and patient and pleasant to be around. I went abroad for a month in July and when I came back it was like a switch had flipped. He frequently complained about his appointments and clients. He called me to pick fights and give unhelpful and aggressive feedback. When I ask him questions about sales he becomes irritable and can’t give straight answers - talks in circles big time. 

I’ve minimized our work interactions as much as possible. I direct questions to anyone but him and I don’t give him clients or appointments if they’re too far away, seem like a small dollar amount, or if the client seems more high maintenance. 

I spoke with my manager about it a while ago because I was really at a breaking point. She told me his behavior isn’t personal and that I should try to get him alone outside of work and make him talk to me over a beer or coffee (weird as hell.) I know it isn’t personal but that doesn’t make it okay? I can remind myself all day every day that it’s not personal but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s very hard to work with because of the way he speaks to me, and how embarrassing it is that the sales manager can’t write a legible document or give me basic tips on qualifying clients so he spends less time talking to people who won’t buy his damn daisies.

Upper management has floated the idea to me of joining the sales team more directly next year and I want the experience but hate the thought of this guy being my boss. Aside from his dickhead personality, he just can’t give me any clarity or help with the actual sales stuff. I always have to go to the other sales people or our director of ops with my questions if I want a real answer. The salesperson I’m closest to will be out on maternity leave for January and February, as will my boss, and I’m DREADING it, knowing I will have to do more legwork to get the help I need or just suck it up and get berated by asking the sales manager. 

I really like the company and my other coworkers but I’m afraid this guy is going to push me out. Any advice on improving our relationship, or if this company is worth staying at considering a positive relationship won’t make him a good manager? FWIW, it’s a small company and my boss is technically HR. She already knows about all of this and again, just reminds me it’s not personal and to not internalize it.

I’ve been working on reducing my body fat for about a month now, but I haven’t seen much change in my body fat percentage. I’m hoping for advice on what I might be doing wrong or how to adjust my approach. Here’s some background:

 • Age: 22

 • Height: 168 cm

 • Weight: 63.2 kg

 • Muscle Mass: 28.7 kg

 • Body Fat Mass: 12.6 kg

 • Body Fat Percentage: 20.0%

 • BMR: 1,650 calories

My Goals

I aim to maintain or slightly increase my muscle mass (by 1–2 kg over time). My main focus is reducing body fat to reveal a six-pack, ideally within the next two to three months, targeting a lean and athletic look like a football player—without getting bulky.

My Daily Routine

 1. Morning Walk to the Gym: I walk 3.5 km to the gym, taking about an hour and burning calories (photo included in the link).

 2. Pre-Workout: I take a pre-workout with 200 mg of caffeine.

 3. Warm-Up: I warm up on the treadmill for 10 minutes at 6 km/h, burning 50–60 calories (photo included in the link).

 4. Workout Routine: I follow a push-pull-leg split with 45–50 minutes of weightlifting per day (photo included in the link):

 • Day 1: Push (chest, shoulders, triceps)

 • Day 2: Pull (back, biceps)

 • Day 3: Legs

I repeat this cycle, taking one rest day per week, with two abs sessions to help define my core.

 5. Post-Workout Meal: I have three servings of Greek yogurt totaling 270 calories and 30g of protein.

 6. Midday: I walk 1 km to a coffee shop, burn additional calories, and drink a zero-calorie Red Bull while studying for 5–6 hours (photo included in the link).

 7. Evening Walk Home: I walk 4 km home, burning more calories (photo included in the link).

 8. Dinner: My last meal includes:

 • 200–250g of white rice (270–330 calories)

 • 200g of air-fried steak (400–600 calories depending on the cut; photo attached showing trimmed steak from the butcher)

 • 400–500g of raw mango (250–300 calories)

 • 220 mL of Laban (100 calories, 6g protein)

In total, my daily intake is around 1,500–1,600 calories, creating a deficit of 700–800 calories based on my activity (Apple Watch photos provided in the link).

Concerns and Request for Advice

Even with this calorie deficit, I haven’t noticed much fat loss or visible changes in my abs over the past month. My goal is to bring my body fat percentage down to around 12–15% to reveal a six-pack within two to three months.

Is this goal realistic, given my current routine and diet? I’d really appreciate any tips on fine-tuning my routine or diet to help achieve a leaner look and visible abs. Any advice on what I might be doing wrong or adjustments I could make would be amazing. Thanks!

It's been almost a year now, and while close friends obviously know a ton about my partner and how our relationship has been progressing, for acquaintances I haven't seen in years hearing about my partner and our relationship milestones is still a big 'life update'.  
  
And yet, with all those casual friends who have shown some level of interest in my past hetero relationships (genuinely enthusiastic or feigned; that's secondary for the purpose of this question), I receive zero reactions to breaking this news. Just today, I met up for coffee with a friend from high school whom I haven't seen in years; when I mentioned twice (in passing, in relation to other conversation topics) that my girlfriend just moved in with me and things have been stressful, there was not even a neutral ""oh!"", let alone a positive reaction or a follow-up question.  
  
I know this is a pretty trivial concern, but I'm curious to know if anyone shares this experience. I can't help but wonder if those nonreactions mask the many questions straight cis people might have but are afraid to ask (""So… you're what now? Bi? Lesbian? What about that guy from two years ago?""); if the non-acknowledgement of such big news is discomfort or even queerphobia; or are those people just weird for not giving a fuck about people they made the effort to meet in the first place?

Perhaps worst of it is , this internship is the only thing that counts for my grade in my current semester of college. I've to write a report on it , and I've very little to write about .

True, I wouldn't die or anything if I didn't get an offer from the company; but considering the state of the market right now , it sure as hell would make me feel a lot more secure if I did get an offer from the company. Especially considering that my college removed me from their placements program. 

I'll also be applying for my masters , but I am not very very optimistic about my chances of that either.

1grv31j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1grv31j/mornings_at_mcdonalds_w_boomers/,Mornings at McDonalds w/ Boomers,"Long time scroller, first time boomer being a fool poster…. 2 stories 

1. Recently was on the road for work when I pulled over at a McDonald’s for some breakfast. I decided to go in since my breakfast wasn’t going to be eating while driving friendly.

I have a seat at a table that has a bench on one side and chairs on the other (I opted for the bench), popped in my AirPods, ordered table service on the app and started to search for a video to watch while eating breakfast. (Note on the AirPods: they were in but nothing was playing and noise cancelling was off). While scrolling and waiting for my breakfast a longer table (seats 6-8) started to fill up with the usual suspect boomer loafers…. No biggie they have their coffee and it is like 5 old ladies and one guy… I heard one of the ladies complain about the type of chair she had when all of the sudden the boomer guy stood up, promptly walked to my table and took the chair across from me to give to that lady…. nor did he bring a chair back to the table…

I promptly stood up and now blocked this guys only path back to his table. He came around the table and got face to face with me, a little puffed up like he was the man, assuming I would just move out of his way when I instead took a step towards him, at which point he realized he had an issue. To which the following conversation took place loud enough for his table full of old ladies to hear:

Me: excuse you sir

Boomer: uhhhh

Me: did you just take a chair from my table without asking me….

Boomer: i uh uh uh uh

Me:  you never take a chair from my table or anyone’s table ever again without politely asking permission….. 

Boomer: oh oh oh oh ok….  (Hangs head but clearly thinks this is over and I will move, because he starts to try to step around)

Me: No sir, you owe me an apologies and make sure it is loud enough for these ladies to hear… 

Boomer: (reluctantly) I I I I apologize.

I take my seat and my good shows up 2 minutes later…. I decided to not play any music and instead listen to the clucking at the table next to me…. They had no idea what to do.


Story 2…. Also a breakfast stop at McDonald’s 

I hate going to an unknown McDonald’s in the morning…. It is like going to a new church…. Inevitably you take someone’s seat and they are butthurt. 

I had taken a seat that I thought looked safe… nobody at the tables surrounding it m… because typically these boomer loafers occupy like 5 tables together…. I was eating when I see  a few boomers stroll in and start to occupy the table next to me…. Ok I will finish my food, drink, and reading this news article…. Now they are standing up staring, whispering, and shaking their heads… here we go…

Two of the literally just set at my table…. 

Me: Excuse you!!!! What are you doing….

Boomers: we sit here every morning

Me: so you have the right to just plop down where I am eating 

Boomers: well you don’t mind do you

Me: (loud enough for everyone to hear) YES, that is rude, inconsiderate, and you didn’t even ask. Now take your coffee and find another spot… and leave the chairs….

They relocated…. I decided to stay an extra 15 minutes or so for good measure and to further annoy them…..


The sad thing is, any either of these instances, if they just would have said, “excuse me sir may I …..”   then absolutely I would have obliged… courtesy goes a long way….

Maybe I need to stop going to McDonald’s for breakfast when I’m the road.

1grv1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1grv1gb/alien_oc_observe_humans/,Alien OC Observe Humans ,"
My OC Ebralik is a Pthumerian Splicer (magic scientist/engineer) that is sent to observe humans by his superiors. As he observes humans he finds out many things that separates his people from humans but at the same time shows they aren't so different.

	1)  Ebralik is vexed by humans idea of purpose or rather their desire to be free of it. When humans talk about robots doing everything for them, it feels like they want to grow weak and undisciplined in the wake of their prosperity. He feels as though humans don't have the same passion for their work as his people do as Ebralik could spend centuries working to make new technology and find fulfillment in the journey and the destination, his 95 year old grandfather is still a physically active miner and feels his purpose as he mines in tunnels. He asks himself ""Do humans want to be free of the road to fulfillment, to indulge in hedonism until they inevitably feel empty?""

	2)  Information seems to be open and free to humans which baffles Ebralik as knowledge is like a ravine that must be built correctly so the plants grow, grow in a way optimal to the surrounding area. Free reign of knowledge, information, and ideas seems to create division in human societies. While the Pthumerians aren't kept dumb somethings that could send a wrong message are blocked from the populace.

	3) Human technology intrigues Ebralik, and shows him that despite the chaos he sees in humans some fascinating things and brilliant minds come from their numbers. From chemical kinetic weapons, particle accelerators, meta materials ect. While his kind had technology way above humans, their technology has been dwindled after a cataclysm and have been brought down. Humans take on technology has fascinated Ebralik and he takes inspiration from it as he makes plasma weapons from scrap metal.

	4)  Alcohol is odd to Ebralik as he wonders why humans would willingly ingest poison. The concept of fun isn't alien to Ebralik simply this method is. The only human beverages Ebralik enjoys are coffee and energy drinks as they increase his capacity for his passion.

	5) Humans Innovations, While Ebralik is fascinated with humans capacity for innovation the idea that it can collapse their economy seems like an issue of their actions and mindset. Pthumerians use their innovations to supplement and aid Pthumerian workers not replace them. Humans collectively choose to make things that replace the human worker, leaving most people without jobs, and wonders why their economy suffers. Innovations & Robots don't have to be a problem it seems that humans have an urge the follow the path of making their own species obsolete instead of making tools to aid the worker.

	6) Humans capacity for polluting their world baffles and irritates him. As he hatched in a subterranean colony on Mars and his people work tirelessly to build up what they have now, it breaks his heart to see a world that innately has the ability to support life be corroded by the most sapient species on it. He grew a deep fascination & admiration with the human planet, from the air, to the beasts. It breaks his 3 hearts to see smog fill the air, landfills flood landscapes, oceans full of oil and trash. It's a slow death and corruption akin to watching Pneuma Loss end a Pthumerian as their bodies and minds wither. However he will use scrapyards to his advantage in his craft as the concept of ""Trash"" is rarely used with his people, everything has a purpose.

	7)  The humans seem to have accepted individualism rather than his kind who has had to rely on a Collectivism culture since their origin. It feels like a catalyst for greed & corruption rather than prioritizing everyone, the individual values themselves.

	8) Ebralik is confused by the concept of gender roles as his people are similar in size and strength so gender based roles were never a thing. He's seen humans of both sexes do the same things and he can't wrap his head around genitals making you more valuable or better at leadership.

1grv107,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1grv107/dosing_by_weight_or_volume/,Dosing by weight or volume?,"Coming from pourover mostly, I'm used to dosing coffee and water by weight.

I have an old 2 cup brikka model (with the weight on top of the spout). For water it was pretty easy to measure 100g up to the level marker. For coffee, however, I can either fill the basket to the top without tamping, which results in slightly different weight for different coffees, or I can do a constant weight dose and sometimes it won't fill the basket entirely.

How do you all go about it? For now I'm dosing by volume, but I end up wasting a lot of coffee since I grind too much to make sure I fill the basket all the way. However, if I were to do the opposite, how can I level the coffee bed? What if there's a lot of empty space, how will it affect the extraction?

It’s been an incredible ride, and I’m thrilled to share that [Face Swap AI](https://www.videofaceswap.ai/share?source=reddit&ad_id=noad) is now officially available on iOS and Android! 🎉

Here’s a little peek behind the scenes: It all started with the web version of Face Swap AI. As a team of TV and movie enthusiasts, we couldn’t resist testing it out ourselves. Imagine watching The Office but with your coworkers' faces swapped into every scene. Or starring in your favorite Marvel movie as the lead superhero. Hilarious? Absolutely. Weird? Even more so. 😂

But here’s the thing, we realized something was off. Nobody wants to be tethered to their desktops for something this fun. We’re all glued to our phones anyway, right? And as feedback started rolling in, our early users echoed the same sentiment: ""This is amazing! But can I use it on my phone?""

So, we thought: Why stop at the web? If swapping faces could bring so much joy at a desk, imagine what it could do on the go! That’s when we decided to bring Face Swap AI to mobile. Fast forward through sleepless nights, a bunch of testing and plenty of coffee, and here we are Face Swap AI in the palm of your hand.

Now, whether you’re turning your friend into a sitcom star, imagining yourself as an action hero, or just having a good laugh, you can do it all straight from your phone. No need to wait, no need for a computer—just pure creativity and fun at your fingertips.

What makes this so special for us is how it all started as something we built for our own amusement. It wasn’t just a project; it was personal. But seeing how much joy it’s brought to others? That’s the real win.

So, if you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to star in your favorite show, or you’re just looking for a laugh, give Face Swap AI a try. Swap some faces, share your masterpieces, and let us know what you think. Who knows? Maybe you’ll discover your alternate reality self! 😉

We’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or even wild ideas for what to do next. Let’s keep making creativity accessible—and a little ridiculous—for everyone. 🎬

1gruyb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1gruyb1/hahahah_hahahaha/,hahahah. HAHAHAHA.,"The majority of agents are educated women who READ. Like whole BOOKS.

Wanna know why it's mostly cultured women that are agents? Because we actually buy books. and read them. And then buy MORE. Yes, it's a business.

And not asinine coffee table books like that Project 2025 book. Obviously not meant for people who read actual books with any regularity.

But no go ahead, position yourself to share with us poor masses what YOUr FEMalE perspective is.

Because oh wow you so get us. You could be the next Lady Bejezus. How dare we not fall over from your literary talents?!?!

to;dr Make sure your opinions are clearly and forcefully presented in your query letters.
