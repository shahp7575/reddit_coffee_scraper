1q8ug8a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8ug8a,"The Bugarski House in Sombor, Serbia","One of the many protected historical buildings the criminal regime in Serbia has destroyed in order to launder money and purposefully destroy heritage and history. 

""At number 12, the house of the Bugarski family was demolished during the procedure of obtaining protection from the Provincial Institute, at a time when investors had already received certain documentation. Kosta Bugarski was a prominent prefect of Sombor and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper *Sloga*. The house was designed by architect László Szabó. Every ornament on the house had artistic value—doors, windows… Everything, just as in the case of the house where famous Serbian poet Laza Kostić lived, ended up in a truck that carried away the rubble.

Although citizens of Serbia are currently worried about far more important existential issues, it seems that this news deeply shook people. Here are just some of the comments on social media: “Every time I see things like this, a part of me dies”; “A disgrace! We don’t know how to preserve or appreciate anything. We so easily renounce a good part of our culture and past. Where there is no culture, there is no people!”; “A project to destroy everything that is Vojvodinian is underway—from existence, history, culture, books, houses, and churches…”; “The question is who took the excavator to demolish it? Someone may have ordered it, but if someone refuses to carry it out and the people support them, maybe it can be saved. Like this, as long as there are ‘executors,’ everything goes to ruin!”…

The investor, Milovan Gogić, owner of the “Amigo kafa” coffee brand, plans to build an apartment building on this site. Who will buy apartments there, given that Sombor lost nearly 20% of its population between the last two censuses, is a question we will probably get an answer to one day. As is the question of who allowed one of the most beautiful architectural ensembles from the late 19th century in Vojvodina to be demolished.

Vojvođanska Street, which leads from the city center to the railway station—formerly known as Bajski Sokak—is known in Sombor for its famous tree-lined avenues and 19th-century houses. It was the first street in the city to be paved with cobblestones, back in 1873.

As of March 7 this year, part of this street has been placed under the protection of the Provincial Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments. At the same time, at the initiative of the citizens’ association Friends of Sombor Heritage, more than 2,000 people signed a petition calling for the protection of Vojvođanska Street and the prevention of further demolition of houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But it seems that city officials and investors do not care about these decisions.""",1,1768018994.0,Lost_Architecture,0,1.0,False

1q8ue2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q8ue2i/struggling_to_make_irl_friends_with_other_girls/,Struggling to make irl friends with other girls,"I've always had difficulty befriending women growing up, even though I am also a girl. It's one of those things that really eats away at my self-esteem. I am a little scared to talk about it, but since I don't really have anything to lose, might as well talk about it.

\- There was this girl in university that I knew, let's call her Anna. Anna was cool and all, I thought we got along, we had known each other for 4-5 years. But then one summer, I ask if she wants to grab coffee with me sometime, like a friend-date. She made excuses to avoid me, so I was disappointed. But then, a few days later, I see on my facebook front page (back when fb was still popular lol) that Anna went for coffee with this **other** girl, and posted selfies of her and her friend. It just hurt so much, I stopped talking to Anna completely. I'm not really saying that I felt entitled to Anna's one-on-one friendship, but this kind of thing has happened multiple times, as explained in my next point.

\- Similarly, there was this other girl that I knew who lived across the street during a four-month internship in a different city. Since I didn't know anyone else, I asked if she wanted to go grocery shopping one time, and she said sure. And even though it was a little awkward, I thought we were getting along? But then, a week or two later, I ask that girl if she wanted to spend time with me at this matcha cafe over the weekend, and then she **also** started making excuses. That incident broke me during those four months to the point I didn't even want to bother meeting other people in the city. (I know this is such a minor event, because me and her were only acquaintances, but I still think about that day, even today.)

\- In childhood, girls didn't even bully me, or talk about me behind my back. As far as I know, the vast majority of them didn't even say hi to me, period. There was one kid, Melissa, who came up to me to console me whenever I'd cry during school, but even with her, we never like *hung out* or anything like that. 

\- Although this wasn't IRL, I did join this all-girl online group that I joined half a year back, and at first, it was kind of nice, people were saying hi during movie nights. But then later, those people stopped saying hi, and I felt like my presence was bothering other people. I couldn't relate to the other girls' formative experiences, like having a group of girl friends during high school that they could go watch movies with. (They also had a rule saying: ""No discussion of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues"", which was another reason I left the server.)

Luckily, I've met a few cool girls over the internet that I get along with (at least for now), but I still feel hopeless about finding women in my city that I could ever click with. I know that gender doesn't really matter much for platonic friendship, but when guys have approached me to be friends and spend time, but girls haven't, it makes me feel really **defective** for some reason.

hey guys, i just finished cleaning out a ton of old tools and equipment from my garage and figured i'd share a quick guide on how i got rid of it all for a pretty good chunk of change. it's way better than a basic garage sale if you have a lot of quality stuff.  
  
first, when you're cleaning up the garage to sell everything, remember that all that empty space is actually valuable. you should look into listing your driveway or extra garage space on prked. it's super easy to list and lets you make passive income every month just by renting out that unused space. people are always looking for cheaper and safer parking near them, and hosts on prked make extra money and they can set their own price and schedule. anyway, back to the tools.  
  
the first step is figuring out what you actually have. good brands like snap-on, mac, de-walt, and milwaukee will sell for way more, even used. for pricing, check ebay's ""sold listings"" for your exact model number, not just the active listings, to see what people actually pay. a good starting point is 50 percent of the new retail price if it's in great condition, or 20-40 percent for acceptable stuff. always price a little high because people will try to haggle.  
  
if you have any really old or antique tools, look closely for maker's marks or stamps, especially on planes and saws. brands like stanley (especially the no. 1 plane), disston, and spiers are collectible. collectors often want the original patina and prefer tools that haven't been over-restored.  
  
where to sell it all:  
  
big stuff and full boxes: for large equipment like table saws or welders that you don't want to ship, use facebook marketplace and craigslist. local tool collectors and resellers will scoop up the whole lot at a garage sale or an estate sale. auction houses are a hands-off option but they take a commission, usually 20-30 percent.  
  
smaller, valuable stuff: ebay is best for smaller high-value hand tools you can easily ship and for getting the most value. offerup and nextdoor are good for local pickups too.  
  
when you list something, include the brand, model number, specifications, and a truly honest description of the tool's condition. tell them if it's cosmetic wear or if it has a real flaw (like play in the motor or missing a guard). mention all the accessories like the case, batteries, and manuals, because those add value.  
  
for photos, use natural light and a clean background so the tool is the only focus. take wide shots of the whole tool, close-ups of the brand/model number, and close-ups of any rust or damage you mentioned in the description. if it's a power tool, try to show it in action or plugged in to prove it works.  
  
safety for local sales is key. never have a stranger come to your house for a transaction. meet the buyer at a public location like a busy coffee shop or bank parking lot. even better, a lot of local police stations have designated ""safe trade stations"" in their lobbies or parking lots which are monitored by cameras. always accept cash only.  
  
hope this helps you clear out your space and make some cash.",1,1768018350.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Quick summary:

I am 32 yo

Stopped the pill at 26, it took 1.5 years for my period to come back. I had had an imaging done and there were white spots on my ovaries, PCOS suspected

But my period came back « regularly » every 30-40 days and I could feel that I ovulated normally every time (all symptoms were present)

I had bad acne so I went back on the pill to take accutane in 2024

It has been a year since I stopped the pill to conceive. I bleed 1-2 days every 45-65 days but I am sure I do not ovulate. My acne is also coming back full on.

I am in India for the next months so cannot see my GP. I know nothing about how to conceive with PCOS and am freaking out… what can my GP try when I come back to Canada? What are the treatments, side effects, chance of it working? Will she need to refer me to a fertility expert (which will take a long time) or can she treat me?

Anything I can do in the meantime to « kickstart » my ovulation? Help with acne?  I am healthy, not very stressed, I barely drink, stopped coffee, focus on good routine, sleep, I exercise daily.

1q8u4p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8u4p3/monetizing_your_unused_space_during_the/,monetizing your unused space during the conference rush,"  
  
hey all, figured i'd share some tips on making some extra cash if you live near a big convention center or in one of the cities that always hosts major conferences like las vegas, chicago, or san francisco. the conference season usually peaks in the spring and fall (march-november), and when those thousands of attendees roll into town, the demand for everything goes crazy.  
  
first and honestly the easiest way to make money with almost zero effort is your parking space. if you have a driveway, garage, or even just an extra spot that you don't use much, especially during the day when people are at the conference, list it on an app like prked. conference attendees are always looking for a spot that's way cheaper than a commercial garage and ideally closer to the venue or their hotel. as a host, you can list your space in minutes, set your own prices and schedule, and it's a super passive income stream. for the parkers, they get convenient parking in a private spot, which feels safer than street parking, and they can book it by the hour or day right from the app, skipping the parking chaos completely. they can even check for spots with security cameras which is a nice peace of mind thing.  
  
beyond parking, there are a bunch of other ways to capitalize on your location.  
  
short-term rentals. yes, airbnb or vrbo is the obvious answer if you're willing to move out for a few days. you can charge premium prices during a major convention like retail's big show in january or shoptalk in march. if you don't want overnight guests, consider listing your living space for hourly rentals on platforms like peerspace. corporate groups sometimes need a quiet, local spot for an off-site meeting, an interview hub, or a small social gathering that's less formal than a hotel ballroom.  
  
concierge and food services. if you live right near the venue, you can do easy, low-key stuff. if your local laws allow it, selling cold bottled water, coffee, or simple packaged snacks right on your front lawn during the morning or evening rush can bring in a few hundred dollars over a couple of days. remember to check your local city rules on temporary vendor licenses though. or, if you have a larger vehicle, offer a shuttle service for a fee from the conference hotel clusters to the venue entrance for groups who want to avoid the ride-share surge pricing.  
  
rent out space for vendors. a lot of smaller companies want a presence near the conference but can't afford a booth inside the convention center. if you have a prominent corner lot, a commercial garage, or an open front yard, you might be able to rent that space out for a temporary pop-up shop or a branded display. this is more hands-on but the daily rent could be quite high.  
  
hope this helps anyone who lives in a conference city turn that temporary traffic mess into some easy money.",1,1768018052.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q8u1vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1q8u1vt/thanks_cher/,thanks cher.,"this is just a short sharing of one of the most heartwarming things my teacher has ever done for me.

its something i still remember till this day even thou it has been 6 years since that day (WHAT 2020 WAS NOT 6IX YEARS AGO NO WAY BRO)



i still remember that day somewhat vividly, i had just received my PSLE results (where i didnt do so well lol, yes even back then sad panic korkor was cheeks at his acads)

before i went home, i wanted to walk around the school compound and check out some rather nostalgic places one last time since that was where i had some of my fondest memories. (making new friends, talking, playing football in the field etc)

i told my mom who followed me to get my results to just wait for me outside the gate since i wanted some alone time to soak that moment all in. the moment where i realised that ive graduated pri sch, the moment where i was to be a teenager.

i first went to check out my old classrooms (obv didnt enter lol), then checked out the first floor.

after checking out the canteen (where all the stalls were closed because yk holidays) i went to the teachers office (which is separate from the general office) intending to admire it a bit.

(context, i was really mischievous when i was in pri sch LOL so it became a common place for me lol)

while i just sat at the tables outside the office, my chinese teacher came out.

i remember her because she was really strict with us, and obv as kids (HAHAHA WUT) we all were like ""why so strict"" and we all at that time really didnt enjoy it LOL.

but now that PSLE was over, i understood why she was so strict with us in the first place.

she wanted all of us to do well, and it was only creeping in now. perhaps a little too late.

when i saw her, obv i called her ”老师“ (teacher for those who wanna know) and she said my name.

she then called me over, to which i had that knee jerk reaction of hesitating (cause ya LOL) and she then passed me a 红包 (red packet).

pasted outside the 红包 was a note.

(she wrote this in chinese, i will write the OG version and also the translation which may be inaccurate sorry HAHA)

 "" 流眼泪 (using pseudonym) 恭喜你毕业了！升上中学后要继续努力哦！你永远是老师心中的100分！加油！“

“ \*my name\* congratulations on graduating! once you enter secondary school you must continue to work hard! you will forever be 100 marks in my heart! keep going!""

  
i had literally never gotten anything of this sort in the past, and even till today i dont get these kinda handwritten notes HAHA

it was special for sure, even thou i wasnt the best student (i am a terrible student lol) i still got a note. and it was an encouraging one at that.

it means a lot to me and i still have the note with me till today. (framed and all lol)

whenever i have a bad day, i will look at it and remember this quote.

""当你怀疑你自己的时候，不妨想想那些相信你可以的人”

""when you encounter self doubt, think about those who believe in you""

  
from the bottom of my heart, thank you miss sim! ill keep going, and hopefully one day i will return the favor by buying you a coffee HAHAHAHAAHA

  
now that thats my sharing, what about you guys?

have yall had a similar experience to mine? let me know :)",9,1768017825.0,SGExams,3,0.91,False
1q8u1ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q8u1ph/ex_hit_my_car_i_cussed_him_out_he_got_his/,"Ex hit my car, I cussed him out, he got his feelings hurt","So Sunday, December 28th I (F 18) spent the night at my -at the time- boyfriends (M 18) house. He wakes up usually around 6:00 AM to get ready and leave for work as its a 30 min drive. I wasn't aware but apparently he ended up being late the morning of Monday December 29th, and only left his house at about 7:30. Now obviously being late is an issue, but he works at a very small diesel mechanic shop in which his boss wasn't even in the state, and would've gotten little to no reprimanding for being late. When he left his house he gave me a kiss goodbye, walked out, and he ended up reversing and hitting my car with his steel body truck. My car is bright blue, and is the first of the four cars you seen when you leave the house so it would have been very hard to miss. When he hit my car he did not get out to check the damage and did not even text or call me to relay the news. I was woken up around 8:00 by his phone call that his mom, who he lives with, needed to come into his room to check something out. Obviously, I obliged, got up, and was getting ready to get out when while I was talking to his mom I got a text from him, letting my know he ""tapped"" the drivers side of my car. In shock, I mention to his mom this and we both go outside to check the damage, we end up seeing that my left rear bumper is badly dent, my left taillight is shattered and part of it has completely detached. I am feeling a lot of emotions, but immediately decide not to call the cops or file an insurance claim because he is my boyfriend and I wouldn't want his monthly to go up, or for him to suffer in anyway from this situation (keep this in mind). I am in shock and upset, but I notice that his mom is entirely too calm about this situation, which is understandable since he has hit two parked cars prior to this incident. She helps me temporarily fix my light, texts my boyfriend, where he proceeds to only respond with ""oh shit"". As we are standing around my car I see my boyfriend has yet to call me and apologize, and I proceed to call him to get him to look for the parts needed to fix my car online. When I call he tells me he is not busy and will get on it immediately, which he does proceed to do. I leave with my tail light taped back together so it can hold off until my boyfriend fixes it. Now for some background, I have a 2005 Volkswagen Beetle which is a baby/robins egg blue color, and if it wasn't for its flaws, being an old car and such, it would essentially be my dream car. Also, I bought this car myself and it is my very first car, and entirely mine. Because of all of these factors, him hitting my car hurt me, so I proceeded to drive home absolutely sobbing. I stop at starbucks to grab coffee, and end up paying for the person behind mine's order because I am trying to turn a bad day good. I continue sobbing on my way home, truly only upset about my car, not even the fact that he barely apologized and did not care to check on my car, which he knows is very important to me. I sit with my feelings for a few hours before work in which I stop at another coffee place to get my coworker coffee and tip the barista, to, once again, send good out into the world. At work I am talking to my coworker and I realize how truly upset I was, and how ridiculous the situation at hand is. When my boyfriend gets off work at 5:00 I tell him to come to my work, and he complies. I then walk with him to the back where I proceed to cuss him out. I was mean and insulted him, which I do admit was very wrong, but in the moment, I believed I just needed to get my feelings out and for him to properly understand the situation. I brought up the fact that him hitting my car was stupid and careless, and the fact that I am the third person he has done this to is ridiculous. Throughout this entire time he is yet to say much to me other than ""I'm sorry"" and ""I know"", and so I go out to check on my customers I had and when I return he was gone. I think nothing of it, just that he got my point and he needed some time to himself. That night we don't talk but I am asleep almost immediately. On Tuesday, December 30th I essentially sleep all day as prior to Tuesday I had worked 6 days straight, all very intensive shifts, so we once again don't talk. But, Tuesday around 7:00 I check his location and realize he's at a house party with his family & friends in which I was not invited to. Obviously, I am upset he did not communicate with me so I do not go out of my way to text him either. Then, Wednesday rolls around. I am still upset, but want to talk to him. I take a shower and while I'm in my bathroom after the shower, I received a text from him at 4:16 PM, breaking up with me. We were together for 1 year and 7 months and had a fairly mature relationship (getting ready to move in together in the next few months, etc.) so receiving this text was hard enough as is. I call him, he doesn't pick up, I facetime him, and he picks up. He is outside at work and entirely uninterested in this phone call. I am essentially scream crying and my dad rushes into my room so I have to hang up the phone. He comforts me, and I immediately leave to go to his shop and try and talk to him. I get to the shop around 4:45, so he is about to get off and is just sitting around with his coworkers, where he again, proceeds to pretend like nothing has happened. I walk into the area and start crying as I ask him to come and talk to me. Then, for the next 2.5 hours at this shop I essentially just am begging for him back, saying I'd do anything, even buy him things, and that I would work on my attitude more. It's cold out so we end up in his truck. I am still just begging for him back, trying to understand whats really going on. In the past, I have been very mean and hurt him but he has addressed this with me and I was working on it, clearly though, I let my emotions get the best of me on Monday when he hit my car. Eventually he gets a call from his mom whilst we're in the truck and he steps out to take it. I lock the truck doors behind him in an attempt to not hear him talk badly about me, and to lighten the mood as it was something silly I had often done in our relationship before. He tries the door once, realizes its locked, and proceeds to walk off. I wait around 10 minutes, rev his truck to get his attention, call him, and nothing. After a period of time I get out, keys in hand, looking for him to continue talking and to give him his keys back. It is dark and cold outside and I am unable to find him, and cannot get into the actual shop because the doors are locked. I figure he is inside so I call for him a few times with no response. I believe at this point his phone was dead and he was just actively not responding to me while being inside. I get into my car and drive around the shop looking for him using my headlights, when I see a car pull in. I am confused, turn off my car, and see its the cops. They ask me if I called them and I tell them no, and comply with all of their questions (what are you doing here, who are you here with, etc.). Eventually, I am told to leave and that my boyfriend called the cops on me. I was told by the police to not contact him that night and to go home. I proceed to go home, still entirely confused, and end up texting my boyfriend (i know i shouldnt have, i was going crazy), asking him to call and tell me goodnight because even though it was maybe 8:30 PM I was trying to sleep and forget about this night. He texts back, saying hes about to hop in the shower but afterwards he would. While on the phone I ask and see if it's okay for me to ask him a few questions, which he says yes to. I asked him why he called the cops and it turns out its because his friends dad told him to since I was in his truck where he had left his gun. I am in disbelief as he is an 18 year old man, so I ask if he wanted to, or if he felt threatened by me, and he said no, he just did because his friends dad told him to. After talking for maybe 10 more minutes I ask if he could come to my house and give me one last hug and kiss, which is something he offered to give me at the shop. He says yes, but he is actually now at a New Years Eve party with said friend and friends dad so he needs to make an excuse. He ends up not being able to leave, but does call me back to try and tell me goodnight. He hangs up on me after maybe 5 minutes and says that he cannot call. I text back confused, asking for him to please call and tell me goodnight and then he goes no contact. I call frequently throughout the night, and at one point his friends dad answers and tells me he does not want to talk to me. The next morning, I get up for work around 5:00 and call him again. But, I now believe I am blocked. Because of the hysterics I am in from 5:00 AM to 2:00 PM, I end up calling him around 27 times. Partially because I wanted to talk, and also because I truly could not believe he blocked me. Around 2:30 I am finally able to take a nap and my dad comes into my room, telling me his friends dad called him, told him I had called my boyfriend over 300 times and that they were going to file a harassment charge if I contacted him one more time. Now, it has been 9 days since we've talked and I am still not able to contact him, and he has still yet to contact me. I am mostly posting this because I want some of y'all's opinions on the situation. I know I was wrong in some aspects, but I am curious what y'all, as an outsider, may think.

Also, I am very sorry this is a long post, but a lot happened. If there are mistakes forgive me as this is still an incredibly emotional thing for me to think about.",1,1768017810.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I dose 18 grams of coffee and aim for about 36 grams of espresso output. When I stop the shot right at 36 grams on the scale, sometimes the shot finishes way too fast (like in 20 seconds), which tells me it’s too fine. So I adjust the grinder one notch coarser—say from a setting of 11 to 10. But then the next shot suddenly stretches out to something like 35 seconds, which is way too long.

It’s a huge jump for just a single notch change, and I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong or if the machine or grinder is just that finicky. Any tips or similar experiences? Thanks!",1,1768017381.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
1q8tuan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rubiks_Cubes/comments/1q8tuan/what_is_goal_of_life/,what is goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

This is coming out in one long spill because I can’t get my head straight.

I (43M) have a stressful, salaried job in the evening a short commute away; my wife of a little over twenty years (42F) works part-time from home. We’ve always been *that couple* — joined at the hip from the beginning. Yes, we settled down young. Neither of us had anything remotely serious before we met. We’re both a bit emotionally hungry and we’ve always taken care of each other in that way.

We have two kids (20F, 17M). Most weeks we feel like we’re operating on different time zones, but we’ve always tried to protect some overlap — coffee together after a school drop-off, splitting a matinee when we’re both free, that sort of thing. Maybe it wasn’t enough. I don’t think I’ll ever stop interrogating that. We used to joke about what we’d do when the house was finally quiet and we had ourselves back.

This evening, we went to a small neighborhood brewery for a drink — nothing fancy, just a few stools and a food truck out back. I’d been looking forward to it because she’d been off for most of the week. She’s had a long history with anxiety and depressive spells, and we’d only recently come through a rough stretch tied to money — a tax bill, some unexpected expenses, the usual adult panic. I’d clocked the signs and assumed she was spiraling again, so I was hoping she’d talk. Maybe I’d have to own some things (the rough stretch existed because I hadn’t been entirely straight about a financial detail), maybe I’d need to reassure her, maybe things would be uncomfortable for a while — but we’d get through it.

She grabbed us a high table, I ordered the beers, sat down and then—

She told me that for several months now (she couldn’t or wouldn’t pin it down) she’s had feelings for someone she works with (45M). She says nothing physical happened until last weekend, when she went out with coworkers after a long shift. She drove and texted me saying she’d had a few drinks and was staying over at a friend’s house — instead, she was with him. They spent time together again today while I was working. She says they’ve kissed, that it hasn’t gone further, and at the moment I believe her. But she says she’s in love with him, and that she wants a future with him rather than with me. He’s divorced, lives alone, and wants the same thing.

She keeps saying this isn’t about something I failed at. She says she still loves me, still cares deeply about me, still wants to keep things steady for the kids for now. She says she never felt ignored, or emotionally starved, or sexually unfulfilled (not bragging — just clarifying). She says it isn’t about money, or stress, or the handful of arguments we’ve recycled over the years. It’s just how she feels.

Maybe I’m being pathetic, but I feel a huge amount of compassion for her. I know who she is, and I know this must have been tearing her up inside. She doesn’t make life-altering decisions lightly. She’s sat with this long enough to make herself physically ill. In her mind, she’s chosen the option that causes the least harm.

Even so, I think she’s making a catastrophic mistake. I don’t know this man, but there’s no way he could love her the way I do. I don’t hate him for being part of this, but if he ends up hurting her I will want to fucking \[redacted\] him. She says he’s decent; I accept she’s probably sanding down exactly how decent she thinks he is, out of kindness to me. I’ve never met him. She’s mentioned him before as someone she works alongside, someone who was “easy to talk to.” I never saw this coming.

What I can’t answer is whether I should fight for her. Whether I should tell her this was a terrible detour, that I’m still her person, that I forgive her and love her and we can rebuild this. Or whether the only thing left that looks like love is letting her go.

I don’t really have close friends, and I can’t picture what my life looks like without her, but that’s too big to touch tonight. This all happened a few hours ago and it still feels unreal, like I’m suspended just above my own body. She’s asleep now, curled up in the guest room, and she is still the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.",2,1768017165.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Now I'm back on the grind. However, I am having some issues with nausea when I haven't eaten for a while. For the past 9 months this hasn't been an issue--only this past week as I re-entered my routine.

I wake up between 5:45-6, I drink a coffee with almond milk & sugar free syrup around 6:15-6:30. Then I leave for work around 6:50 and arrive around 7:10. At work I get settled, bop around, and usually eat between 7:45-8. I drink a protein coffee throughout the morning and eat a snack at 11ish and lunch at 1:45. I go home at 4 and eat dinner between 8-9 pm. This has been my schedule for the past 9 months (mostly, not in the summer).

However, this past week I have felt extremely sick and nauseated around 7:30. It's to the point where I don't want to eat, but I know I have to. After I eat I feel better. Then when I go home, I get so, so hungry around 5-6 pm that I feel sick and nauseated again. What is going on? Is it that I ate badly over the break and now my body is used to more sugar and calories? I was prediabetic last March but I have lost weight and cut down sugar a lot since then.

The post? ""CEO husband + perfect baby boy = my blessed life! Beverly Hills living! #SpoiledWife""


I was about to roll my eyes and keep scrolling when—


My finger froze.


The photo punched me right in the gut.


Some young, drop-dead gorgeous woman held a toddler, both grinning like they owned the world. Behind them? That stupidly tender look…


My husband.


The location tag showed MY grandmother's estate. The one she had left to ME.


My heart was pounding now, but here was where it got really good:


I knew exactly who this bitch was.


Remember that ""poor struggling college student"" I had sponsored through four years of university? The one who had sent me that weepy thank-you letter about ""working hard to give back to society"" and ""never forgetting my kindness""?


Yeah. Her.


Guess she had found her own way to ""give back.""


I pressed my hand against my six-month baby bump.


My smile was ice-cold.


Oh, sweetheart. You had no idea what was coming for you.


My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone.


I kept zooming in on that photo. On his wrist—the watch I gave him for his thirty-ninth birthday.


The way he was looking at them. At her and that kid.


Like they were his whole damn world.


I hadn't seen that look in two years.


The comments section was pure chaos.


""STOPPP your husband is gorgeous wtf""


""This is what dreams are made of omg""


""Beverly Hills mansion + hot CEO husband + perfect baby = you're living my fantasy life""


And Little Miss Homewrecker was eating it up, replying to everyone:


""He's just really good to me ♥ I'm so lucky""


He's just really good to me.


I wanted to throw my phone through the windshield.


My stomach lurched. Hard.


I shoved the car door open and barely made it to the curb before I was puking my guts out.


""Jesus—Mrs. Blackwood! You okay? Should I take you to the ER?"" Charles, our driver, scrambled out with a water bottle.


I waved him off, rinsed my mouth, and got back in the car.


Every part of me felt like ice.


Our house sat behind the gates of Ridgemont Estates—old money, new money, the kind of neighborhood where everyone minded their business because they all had secrets.


Margaret, our housekeeper, met me at the door. ""Oh honey, you look like death. What did Dr. Morrison say?""


I looked at her. Really looked at her.


""Margaret... has Grayson actually been at the office these past few weeks?""


Her face gave her away before she even opened her mouth.


""That's... that's what he told me to say, Mrs. Blackwood.""


Right.


In this giant house, I was the only idiot still buying his bullshit.


I walked upstairs like a zombie.


Our bedroom was pristine. Magazine-perfect. Cold as a morgue.


Nothing about it said home. Nothing said he actually lived here anymore.


I opened his closet. Rows of suits lined up like soldiers. Everything in its place.


I pulled open the top drawer of his dresser.


A blue velvet box.


Next Wednesday was our ninth anniversary.


Was this supposed to be for me?


Nine years.


We'd started with nothing. A shitty apartment and ramen dinners and dreams bigger than our bank account. I watched him build his company from the ground up, deal by deal, all-nighter by all-nighter.


Six years ago, when everything almost fell apart—when his competitors came for him and things got ugly—I was the one who stepped in front of that knife.


That knife took our first baby.


It took any chance of me having another.


The doctors said my uterus was too scarred. Getting pregnant again was basically impossible.


Which made this baby—this absolute miracle inside me right now—the best anniversary gift I could've ever given him.


I took a breath and opened the box.


A massive diamond ring stared back at me. Blinding. Beautiful.


Empty.


My phone lit up.


Grayson calling.


Chapter 2


I stared at his name on my screen.


Grayson.


My chest felt like someone had reached in and was squeezing my heart with their bare hands.


I let it ring three more times before I answered.


""Hey.""


""Liv."" His voice was smooth as always. Tired, though. Distracted. ""Listen, I've got this international call tonight. Gonna be late. Don't wait up, okay?""


Another call. Another late night.


There was a time when he'd call me before bed no matter what. When he'd talk to me until I fell asleep.


Now? I got a courtesy heads-up like I was his assistant.


I gripped that cold diamond ring until my nails dug into my palm.


""Gray... do you remember what next Wednesday is?""


Silence.


Then I heard it—a woman's voice in the background, sweet and syrupy:


""Gray, who are you talking to? Come help me, Theo can't get his Legos to work...""


He covered the phone, but I could still hear him: ""I'm handling something. Take Theo and get him ready for bed.""


When he came back on, his voice had an edge.


""It's just an anniversary, Liv. Does it really matter that much? Work's insane right now. I'll have my assistant book us somewhere nice and send you something. Sound good?""


My voice came out shaking.


""Grayson. Are you lying to me?""


He sighed. Hard.


""Jesus Christ, Olivia. I'm out here busting my ass for this family, and you're gonna start with the paranoid bullshit again? I'm exhausted. I'm hanging up.""


Click.


The line went dead.


I set my phone down slowly.


Looked at that diamond ring sitting there like a joke.


And I laughed.


Right. How could I be so ungrateful?


He gave me everything money could buy. Designer clothes, luxury cars, a house most people would kill for.


What more could I possibly want?


Except he had no idea what I actually wanted.


Nine years ago, we were splitting instant ramen in a basement apartment. He told me, ""One day I'm gonna get you out of here. Big house. Huge diamond. The whole thing.""


I'd laughed and said, ""I don't need a big house or a diamond. I just need you to keep loving me like you do right now.""


He'd pulled me close and whispered ""I love you"" over and over until I believed it was permanent.


Turns out nothing's permanent.


And that girl I'd helped out of the goodness of my stupid heart?


She'd found her own way to say thanks.


I barely slept that night.


When I did, I dreamed of knives and blood and babies I'd never hold.


Two days crawled by.


On the third morning, I woke up early.


Sat at the breakfast table with my phone.


She'd posted again.


A selfie this time—full makeup, glowing skin, and on her hand?


That ring. The one from the blue velvet box.


The caption read: ""Thank you babe for the early bday gift ♥ Love you so much! Next Wednesday can't come fast enough!""


Next Wednesday.


Her birthday.


More important than our nine-year anniversary, apparently.


That ring was never meant for me.


I stared out the window at the bright morning sun.


I'd never felt colder in my life.


I grabbed my coat.


""Charles. We're going to Beverly Hills.""


Chapter 3


A young nanny opened the door.


She stared at me for a second, then her face went guarded.


""Can I help you?""


I stepped past her into the entryway.


Two pairs of slippers sat neatly by the door. Men's. Women's.


In the living room, a toddler—maybe two years old—was playing on a foam mat, babbling ""Dada, dada"" over and over.


Every word felt like a needle straight through my chest.


I couldn't breathe.


""I'm here to see Grayson Blackwood.""


Footsteps on the stairs.


She came down wearing a silk robe, all soft and sleepy-looking. When she saw me, panic flashed across her face for half a second before she rearranged it into something pitiful.


""Oh my god... Mrs. Blackwood?""


I looked around slowly.


Family photos on the walls. The three of them, smiling. Baby bottles and toys scattered on the coffee table.


This place looked like an actual home.


More than mine ever did.


""Natalie,"" I said, my voice ice-cold. ""I paid for four years of your college. Was this how you planned to pay me back?""


Her face went sheet-white. Her lip trembled.


""Mrs. Blackwood, I... I don't know what you're talking about...""


""No?""


I pulled out my phone and shoved the photo in her face—the one she'd posted. Her and Grayson and that kid.


""Then explain this. My husband. My grandmother's house. Where's your conscience, Natalie?""


Tears spilled down her cheeks. She dropped to her knees like someone cut her strings.


""I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry! It's all my fault! I just—I love him so much, I couldn't help myself! Please, Mrs. Blackwood, please forgive us!""


She was sobbing now, looking like some tragic heroine.


Once upon a time, maybe I would've felt bad for her.


Now? I just felt sick.


""Love?"" I laughed. It sounded ugly. ""Your love is built on someone else's pain. On betrayal. You call that love?""


I looked down at her, perfectly calm.


""Natalie. Playing house in someone else's home? That's got to have limits. This house is mine.""


Her face crumpled. Fresh tears. The full performance.


""Mrs. Blackwood, you don't understand—Gray and I are really in love. He told me... he said you two don't even have feelings for each other anymore. That he only stays because of obligation.""


""Really in love,"" I repeated slowly. ""So your 'real love' is built on wrecking someone's marriage? In my dead grandmother's house?""


""I... I didn't know it was yours."" She bit her lip, tears streaming. ""Gray said he bought it for me... Mrs. Blackwood, please, don't be mad at him. It's all my fault. If you're angry, yell at me—just don't fight with him. He works so hard already...""


What a saint.


I stared at her pathetic little act and realized something:


I didn't want to fight with her.


She wasn't worth it.


The problem was never her.


It was him.


I pulled out my phone and called Grayson right in front of her.


He picked up on the second ring.


""Liv? What's wrong?""


""Grayson."" My voice was steady. Cold. ""You've got thirty minutes to get your mistress and your kid out of my house.""


I hung up.


Natalie's face went from white to gray.


Less than two minutes later, tires screeched in the driveway.


Grayson came through that door.

Our top priorities:

• Safety (comfortable walking around, especially evenings)

• Link light rail access or very strong transit options

• Gyms nearby or in-building fitness

• Walkable coffee shops / cafes / daily essentials

Based on what we’re seeing and our income, we’re budgeting roughly $2,800–$3,500 per month or under, for a 2BR, depending on location, building, and layout. We’re also very open to private rentals (condos, townhomes, ADUs, owner-managed units, etc.), we are also open to large apartment buildings. 

Neighborhoods we’re currently considering:

• Capitol Hill

• Queen Anne / Lower Queen Anne

• Ballard

• Northgate / Roosevelt

• Columbia City / Beacon Hill

• South Lake Union

But we’re absolutely open to other suggestions — especially areas that balance safety + transit + lifestyle.

Would love local insight on:

	1.	Neighborhoods that consistently feel safe and renter-friendly

	2.	Specific pockets/blocks that are especially good (or ones to avoid)

	3.	What availability and competition look like for 2BRs in the April–August window

	4.	Tips for finding private rentals that don’t always show up on Zillow

	5.	Areas with solid gyms near light rail stations

Coming from out of state, while we do travel to the city at least once a year. We are finally trying to make the move. 

My partner works in marketing and I in administration ect while I wrap up an engineering degree. We are open to job opportunities as well! As the market is more recommendation based now it seems. 

so firsthand experience would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!",0,1768016805.0,SeattleWA,1,0.25,False

The rose vibrator hummed relentlessly against my clit, drawing stars across my vision, but in my fevered imagination, it wasn’t silicone—it was Aaron’s mouth, his tongue teasing me with a wicked precision only he could dream up.

Heavens, the thought of him, my roommate, my eternal crush, had me teetering on the edge.

“Yes,” I hissed, cranking up the speed, my hips bucking involuntarily.

I was so close, stars bursting behind my eyelids, when—damn it—the jingle of keys shattered the silence, followed by the unmistakable creak of the front door.

No. No, no, no. Not again. This was the second time this week he’d ruined my orgasm.

I flicked off the toy with a frustrated groan and shoved it under my pillow, my chest rising and falling like I’d just hauled up a flight of stairs.

Sweat beaded on my forehead, even though the room was cool from the slightly open window, and blasting air conditioner.

I froze, my eyes glued to the ceiling as I listened to his heavy footsteps thud closer.

Our bedroom door creaked open, and I slammed my eyes shut, my heart slamming against my ribs.

Please don’t smell it, I begged silently. The air was thick with my scent, musky and unapologetic. Could he? Guys were supposed to have that sixth sense, right?

And worse…..what if he’d heard me moaning his name earlier? That would be mortifying.

“Quit faking it, Jess. I know you’re wide awake.” His voice rolled over me like dark honey, deep enough to drown in, vibrating through the quiet room and straight to my already throbbing pussy.

I stayed perfectly still, holding my breath, hoping he’d buy it and leave.

The silence dragged on, and I figured he’d given up, stalked off to the bathroom or the kitchen.

I cracked one eye open to peek, and there he was, his gorgeous face hovering inches from mine, those honey-brown eyes sparkling with an infuriating mix of mischief and mockery.

A squeak escaped me, half-yelp, half-laugh, and I slapped my palms over my burning cheeks.

“Jesus, Aaron! Personal space much?”

He chuckled, low and rough, pulling back just enough to loom instead of invade.

“Why are you still awake? I thought you had that big test tomorrow.” He straightened up, his tone casual, like he hadn’t just scared the life out of me.

I sat up slowly, pulling my knees to my chest and wrapping my arms around them, trying to hide how flustered I was.

He turned away then, thank God, yanking off his jersey in one smooth pull.

Sweat glistened on his inked muscles, the tattoos flexing as he moved—dragons and symbols that told stories I was dying to trace with my fingers.

I heard my pussy purr, and I pressed my knees tight to prevent the juices from coating my bed. Down, girl. Not now.

I’ve been in love with Aaron Tyrone for what feels like forever.

It’s been my quiet curse since we were kids scraping knees in the neighborhood. He was the villain in my story back then—my next-door bully, the one everyone whispered about like he was cursed.

“Bad news,” they’d say, crossing the street to avoid him. But my bruised little heart? It latched on anyway, because it was the only attention I ever got from anyone.

At home, I was invisible. My dad poured all his love into my step-siblings, and my stepmom never missed a chance to remind me I was “bad luck” because Mom died giving birth to me. I was the shadow girl, overlooked and forgotten.

And yeah, Aaron was hot—even at twelve, with that jaw already cutting edges, dark hair flopping over his forehead until he’d shove it back, revealing those endless brown eyes that could pin you in place. Straight nose, lips made for sin—I’d replayed kissing them in a million stolen dreams.

He bullied me, sure, but he’d muscle in like a guard dog if anyone else tried: “Back off, she’s mine to mess with.” Toxic as hell. I knew it, I should have bolted. But that possessiveness? It hooked me deep, and damn if I didn’t crave the burn.

How we ended up roommates? Pure desperation. College dorms filled up before I could snag a spot, and apartments were insanely pricey.

Where was I supposed to get the cash? Dad? Puh-lease. I had no friends—thanks to my locked-away childhood that made Rapunzel look free-spirited, and sharing with a stranger sounded like a nightmare.

Aaron lived near campus, so I swallowed my pride and asked him for help. He grumbled, but he said yes. Turns out, under that mean streak, he’s not entirely heartless.

Living with him, though? Torture. Sleeping just feet away from temptation every night pushed me over the edge. I deflowered myself with toys just to cope, imagining it was him.

How do you sleep next to fire and not get scorched?

“Are you even listening to me? What’s got you spacing out?” He snapped his fingers in front of my face, jolting me back.

“Huh?” I blinked, my gaze locking onto his eyes.

They were warm as bourbon, sucking me under like quicksand. I could drown happily there.

He huffed, and raked a hand through his tousled hair, leaving it even messier. Sexy bedhead on steroids. I thought.

“I said, I need you to come somewhere with me this weekend.”

“A date?” The words tumbled out before I could stop them, my heart leaping stupidly.

His face crumpled—surprise? Irritation?—and he barked a laugh that didn’t reach his eyes.

“In your dreams, maybe.”

The words landed like a gut punch, but I played it off, rolling my eyes with a snort.

“Ouch. Way to crush a girl’s ego at midnight.” Inside, though? It hollowed me out, but I’d take scraps over nothing.

“My grandpa’s throwing this big family dinner. Everyone’s gonna be there.” He leaned against the dresser, arms crossed, looking effortlessly sexy in just his shorts.

I arched a brow, folding my arms to match him.

“And I’m invited because…?”

“I want you there.” His tone was firm, almost commanding, but that didn’t make it any less vague.

I rolled my eyes. “That’s not exactly a reason, Ronnie.”

He scowled, his jaw tightening. “Do you really love getting on my nerves? I’ve told you a million times to stop calling me that.”

I snickered, shrugging. “You get on mine all the time. Fair’s fair.”

He glared, those heated eyes boring into me, and I felt my cheeks flush. I cleared my throat to break the tension.

“For real, though, why me? Why drag your roommate to a family thing?” My voice came out softer than I intended, almost vulnerable.

“Fiona and Eric will be there.” His voice flatlined, face a blank slate, but I caught the glimpse of an old wound reopening.

Ah. His ex and his cousin. Fiona cheated on him with Eric, shattering Aaron in ways he never admitted.

I never got what he saw in her—beyond her mean-girl vibe, she wasn’t even that pretty.

Maybe it was her big, unhinged boobs. Or maybe he just liked the thrill of the chase. Or… right, her family’s money. But no, Aaron wasn’t that shallow. At least, I wanted to believe he wasn’t.

His family, the Tyrones were loaded, hockey royalty in the US, though Aaron bucked tradition by choosing basketball over the family sport.

That choice pissed off his stoic grandpa, creating this massive rift, but Aaron didn’t budge. He chased his dreams with that fierce determination I secretly admired.

“So, you up for it?” he asked, one perfect brow arched in challenge.

I swallowed, piecing it together. The fake girlfriend act.

“You want to use me as a rebound?” The words slipped out, laced with hurt I couldn’t hide.

He tilted his head, scanning me slow, like he was weighing my soul.

“Yeah. Just for the weekend.”

It felt like a knife twist in my chest, but I nodded anyway, forcing a smile. God, I wanted to grab his shirt, beg, Make it real—just once. But desperate girls get doors slammed, so I bit it back.

“Okay,” I whispered.

A smirk tugged his lips, and he reached out, ruffling my hair like I was his pesky little sister.

“Perfect. We’ll hit the stores tomorrow, I can’t have my ‘girl’ rolling up in those tragic hoodies and sweats. Time for an upgrade.”

He turned and vanished into the bathroom, the door clicking shut behind him.

Alone, the dam broke. Tears streamed down my face, hot and silent.

Why did loving him have to hurt so damn much?

Fake Girlfriend, Real Feelings.
Jessica's POV

“Take a break, we’ll reassemble in thirty,” Aaron’s smooth, commanding voice echoed across the court, cutting through the squeak of sneakers and the thud of basketballs.

The college players scattered like leaves in a gust, grabbing towels and water, their chatter filling the gym.

Aaron stayed rooted in the center, chugging from the bottle I’d slipped into his gym bag that morning. He is such a stubborn ass. 

Earlier this morning, he’d grumbled about not needing it when I offered, but there he was, guzzling it down like it was liquid gold.

Lucky for him, my love made me a fool who’d bend over backward, even if he didn’t deserve it half the time.

I watched from the library’s massive window, perched on a stool with a forgotten textbook in my lap. The view overlooked the court perfectly, and I couldn’t tear my eyes away from how he owned the space—barking orders, demonstrating shots with effortless sexiness.

Students hung on his every word, launching balls toward the hoop like disciples following a prophet.

Aaron coached part-time at Arcadia Hills College, a gig that always puzzled me until I pieced it together: he wanted to nurture the next generation, help them chase dreams like he was chasing his.

Soon, he’d ditch Florida for LA, signing with some top-tier team, and damn if I wasn’t rooting for him harder than anyone. I’d be glued to every game, cheering from afar.

Weird, right? Anyone sane would call me deranged because I was wishing the moon for the guy who’d tormented me since we were kids, chipping away at my confidence like it was his hobby.

But love doesn’t play by rules, especially not mine. Maybe I lost a screw when Mom died; her spirit taking a chunk of my sanity with her. 

Loving Aaron was my beautiful madness.

“How does it feel sharing an apartment with him?”

The question yanked me from my reverie, and I yelped, flailing like a cartoon character.

My stool wobbled, and my forehead bumped the glass with a comedic thump. I clutched the thick curtains for balance, only for them to billow uselessly as I nearly face-planted.

“Oops! I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you!” I rubbed the budding ache on my head and spun to face Debbie, the campus’s favorite punching bag for laughs.

If I was awkward in high school (and okay, maybe still a tad now), Debbie was the queen of geeks: frizzy dirty blonde hair escaping a messy ponytail, braces flashing with every word, coke-bottle glasses magnifying her wide eyes, acne-scarred skin, and that lanky height that made her tower over everyone like a giraffe in sneakers.

But strip away the world’s cruel beauty checklist, she was stunning in her own way: kind eyes, a warm vibe that peeked through if you bothered to look.

Society’s beauty standards were just a rigged game anyway. Superficial and impossible.

I managed a small smile, trying to shake off the embarrassment. “Hey, Debbie.”

She shyly mirrored it, her fingers twisting together, weight shifting from foot to foot like she was debating running away.

“How’d you know I live with him?” I asked, keeping my tone light.

She let out a nervous giggle, relaxing a fraction, probably sensing I wasn’t the judging type.

“It’s not exactly a secret…” She trailed off, squinting as she fished for my name.

“Jessica,” I supplied softly.

“Sorry.” She scratched the back of her neck, cheeks flushing. “So, are you guys, like… do you two, you know…” Her words fizzled out, but the implication hung there, awkward and prying.

I raised a brow, not thrilled. “Don’t you think that’s a weird thing to ask a stranger?”

Deep down, though, a twisted part of me wished it were true—that we were more than roommates, more than this endless push-pull.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.” The air thickened with her discomfort, and I didn’t want to marinate in it.

Who knows what she’d blurt next? Maybe ask if we took a shit together or something equally mortifying.

“Thanks for saying hi, Debbie. See you around.”

I flashed another quick smile, grabbed my bag from the nearby chair, and slipped past her, escaping the library stuffy air.

Outside, I yanked my hood up, shielding my face, and kept my head down as I hustled across campus.

I was lost in a swirl of thoughts, eager to hole up in the apartment and lose myself in a book’s pages, forgetting the world for a bit.

Then, out of nowhere, a firm grip snagged my arm.

I barely had time to gasp before I was hauled sideways, yanked into a cramped, dimly lit space that smelled of chalk and old mops—a janitor’s closet?

The door slammed shut, and my back hit the wall with a thud, knocking the breath from my lungs.

My heart sprinted, faster than a ticking second hand, pounding in my ears. My eyes squeezed shut in panic.

When I pried them open, Aaron’s honey-brown gaze locked onto mine, pinning me harder than any wall ever could.

He was dangerously close, one ripped arm braced above my head, his body heat radiating through the thin air between us.

His scent—sweat mixed with his cologne, flooded my senses, turning my brain to mush.

“What the hell, Aaron?” I stammered, voice shaky, staring up at him like a deer in headlights.

He didn’t answer right away, just held my gaze, leaning in until our breaths mingled, faces so close I could count his lashes.

My mind raced: Is this it? The The kiss I’d fantasized about a million times? Had he finally woken up, seen me as more than the girl next bed?

But no, of course not. He pulled back slightly, a teasing glint in his eyes.

“So, how’d the test go? You were buried in books all week.”

Disappointment sank like a stone in my gut, but I gulped it down, and rolled my eyes to mask the sting.

“Aw, thanks for the concern. But we both know that’s not why you kidnapped me into a closet. And if anyone saw? They’d get the wrong idea. Hotshot basketball coach sneaking off with the hoodie girl? Headline news.”

He chuckled, that deep, rumbling sound that unleashed a swarm of butterflies in my stomach, fluttering wildly.

“Don’t play coy, Jess. You’d eat up those rumors like candy. Hell, you’re probably praying they turn real.”

My pulse skyrocketed, throat tightening as I struggled to swallow. The way he said it, so cocky, like he had me figured out.

“Don’t flatter yourself, that’s not true.” I shot back, the lie tasting bitter because yeah, it was killing me how much I wanted exactly that.

“Yeah, keep telling yourself that.” His whisper brushed my ear, his eyes holding mine with an intensity that screamed certainty.

It hit me then: Does he know about how I feel towards him? All the teasing, the “harmless” bullying—maybe it’s because he senses my feelings, toys with them like a cat with a mouse.

That would be the ultimate humiliation, worse than any childhood taunt.

I shoved against his chest, and spun around to leave, but he caught my wrist, yanking me back until I collided with his solid frame.

His arm banded around my waist, firm and warm, holding me captive.

My hands flattened on his chest, feeling the steady drum of his heart under taut muscle, while mine roared in my ears.

The closet shrank around us, walls closing in, air charged and suffocating.

“You weren’t at the court today. Why?” His voice dropped, eyes searching mine like he was digging for buried treasure.

I hesitated, caught in his gaze. “I had some research to do in the library,” I murmured, so softly that if we weren’t this close, the words would’ve dissolved into nothing.

He leaned in again, closer, my lips parting on instinct, breath hitching. But instead of the kiss, he tugged my hood off, letting my hair tumble free.

“I’ve told you to stop hiding under that thing, Jess. Why so stubborn?”

I blinked, the spell shattering, and pushed him away, harder this time, creating precious space.

“It’s my choice, Aaron. You don’t get a say in how I dress. You’re not my boyfriend.”

He arched a brow, that infuriating smirk curling his lips.

“Oh? Pretty sure I asked you to play the part just the other night. Jealous type might disagree.”

I rolled my eyes. Honestly, knowing Aaron had turned eye-rolling into my default response, more frequent than breathing.

“Fake girlfriend, genius.” I plastered on a sarcastic grin. “And FYI, your proposal sucked. No flowers, no charm…. zero effort. Ugh!”

He smiled, biting his lower lip, a move that drove me crazy.

“FYI? Seriously, Jess? What is this, 2025?” he teased, his tone playful and laced with laughter.

We stared, the tension crackling like static, until hallway chatter and footsteps filtered through the door, bursting the bubble.

“See you later, Aaron,” I whispered, turning to slip out.

“I’ll be crashing at Jason’s tonight,” he called after me. “Don’t bother making dinner for two. Oh, and I left my card, buy whatever you want for the trip tomorrow.”

I whipped my head around, but he was already facing away, tugging his Jersey off.

I stared a beat longer, then left. My heart echoed in my chest with every hurried step, and I wondered—would I ever catch my breath around him?

Wrapped in His Towel
Jessica's POV

“Jess, seriously, what the fuck is taking you so long? Are you trying to wash away your sins under the shower?” Aaron’s growl rumbled through the bathroom door, thick with exasperation, like I’d been in here for hours instead of twenty minutes.

I ignored him, rolling my eyes at the steam-fogged mirror. 

Well, technically, I was scrubbing away every last bit of grime down there, just in case… you know, we got sloppy drunk at this family reunion blowout, or some sneaky cousin spiked our drinks with an aphrodisiac, and boom—things heated up fast.

Ridiculous, right? My brain was a romance novel on steroids these days.

I shook my head at myself, my cheeks burning, but damn if I didn’t secretly root for that wild plot twist to happen

“What has become of me?” I mumbled under my breath, the hot spray pounding my skin like a reprimand for my overactive imagination.

“Jess, if you don’t come out in the next thirty seconds, I swear I’ll storm in and haul you out myself,” he threatened again, his voice edging into that deep, commanding tone that always made my toes curl.

What the hell was his deal? We had a full hour and a half before we needed to leave. Or was there a broadcast of a traffic apocalypse I know nothing off?

I wiped between my pussy with the special towel I kept just for it, then stepped back under the cascade to rinse off the last suds.

Satisfied everything was clean, I turned off the water and padded to the full-length mirror, fogged at the edges but clear enough.

I scrutinized my legs, and ran a hand over the smooth skin to check for stubble, then… yeah, everything else down there. Smooth as silk.

I moved on to inspect my armpits when his countdown kicked in.

“…18, 17, 16, 15…” Panic spiked through me.

I darted around the spacious bathroom, dripping water everywhere, hunting for my towel. It wasn’t on the rack.

Shit—had I forgotten to bring one in? Asking Aaron now would just piss him off more.

I yanked open the cabinet, but I found it empty, the spares usually there weren’t. I’d meant to grab them from the laundry room yesterday.

Damn it. I had one last option, but it was risky as hell.

“…5, 4, 3…” I snatched his large white towel from the hook, the one that smelled intoxicatingly like him—fresh cologne mixed with that unique Aaron musk, and wrapped it snugly around my body. It dwarfed me, soft against my skin.

His countdown hit zero, and the doorknob rattled aggressively.

I unlocked it just in time, and he shoved the door open, standing there like a bouncer at a club with his arms crossed over his broad chest.

His eyes raked over me, slow and appraising, finally settling on my heaving chest where the towel clung a bit too tightly.

He was already dressed to kill: a simple black T-shirt hugging his muscles, beige pants that looked effortlessly stylish, hair styled just right with those long strands pushed back.

He had his stud earrings in today, glinting under the light, and a silver cross pendant dangling against his collarbone.

I couldn’t help it, I drank him in, my soul feasting on his appearance despite the tension. But I snapped out of it first.

“My eyes are up here, Ronnie,” I teased, arching a brow. “And why the hell were you counting down like we’re in boot camp? We still have, like, an hour and a half left.” 

I glanced at the clock on my nightstand for emphasis, water dripping from my hair onto the floor.

He didn’t speak, just kept staring, his gaze intense and unblinking, like he was memorizing me. What was running through that head of his?

“Why are you using my towel, Jess?” he finally asked, his voice low and neutral.

I shifted, clutching it tighter. “I forgot mine, and the spares are still in the laundry. If I’d asked you to grab one, you’d have bitched about me not finishing my shower.” I scowled, mumbling the explanation.

He didn’t respond, just eyed me up and down again, his expression unreadable. It bugged me not knowing if he was judging, annoyed, or… something else.

I brushed past him, heading for the closet to get dressed, when his words stopped me cold.

“Make sure you wash it when you’re done.” 

I whipped around, searching his eyes for a hint—disgust? Teasing? But they gave away nothing, blank as a fresh canvas.

Did he think I was dirty? That sharing his stuff grossed him out? Or was it teasing, his subtle bully mode?

I decided not to overthink it, pushing the door open and stepping into the walk-in closet before he could see the sting in my eyes.

Inside, alone with the rows of clothes, a single tear escaped, trailing hot down my cheek.

Is love supposed to hurt like this? Sharp and constant, like a thorn you can’t pull out? 

I wouldn’t know; I’d never felt real love or affection growing up. No hugs from Dad, no kind words from my stepmom. Just neglect and shadows. So maybe this was normal. Maybe it was all I deserved.

I wiped my eyes roughly and took a deep, steadying breath. I’d survived four years of this push-pull with Aaron, hell, longer if you counted our childhood. I could handle eight more months.

I dried off quickly, slathered on my favorite lotion to soothe my skin, then slipped into the sleeveless chocolate-brown dress I’d picked out.

It hugged my curves like a second skin, the fabric clinging to my wide hips and rode up to reveal my thick thighs, the ones I always hid under baggy pants.

Uncomfortable didn’t seem fit to describe the dress; I felt exposed, and vulnerable. But it was the only thing that seemed appropriate for meeting his fancy family, and I’d stuck to a budget.

Aaron could afford extravagance, but overspending on his dime felt wrong.

He was already doing so much—letting me crash here rent-free for years, covering bills without a word. Gratitude didn’t cover it; he’d saved me from the streets.

Staring at my reflection, I sighed. Once I had real money, surgery for reduction was top of the list.

Doing my makeup was next, but I was hopeless at it. Eyeliners and gloss were my limits. Hopefully, Aaron wouldn’t rag on me for looking plain.

I stepped out, and the door clicked shut behind me. He was lounging on his bed by the window, scrolling through his phone, the evening sunlight haloing him like some brooding god.

The sound drew his head up, and his eyes swept over me, slow and thorough. I fidgeted, tugging the hem, bracing for the hip/thigh roast—his go-to tease.

“I, uh… this was the only outfit I liked. It was affordable and fit okay. Sorry, I’ll change or throw a jacket over it,” I rambled, turning back toward the closet.

His hand caught my wrist, spinning me into his chest with a gentle tug. I stumbled into his chest, the solid warmth of him stealing my breath.

Our eyes locked, the intensity making my pulse race, and he reached up, brushing a damp strand of hair from my face.

My whole body ignited, heat blooming despite the blasting AC.

“It’s beautiful,” he said softly. “You look gorgeous in it.”

My heart leaped into my throat—or maybe straight out of my ass, who knows? It was pounding so hard I could barely think straight.

This was the first ever direct compliment from Aaron, no sarcasm, no backhanded jab disguised as teasing.

And the kicker? I could hear the sincerity threading through his tone, warm and real, like he actually meant it. Not the bully from our past, not the roommate who poked at my insecurities for fun. 

This was something new, vulnerable almost, and it terrified me as much as it thrilled me.

“Huh?” I blinked, dumbstruck.

He released me slowly, held my wrist and guided me to the vanity table. “Sit.”

The command was simple, but it sent a thrill through me, turning my legs to jelly.

I obeyed without a word, sinking onto the vanity stool, my legs still a bit shaky from his compliment and the way his touch lingered.

He rummaged in a nearby chest drawer, and pulled out a sleek black box. Curiosity gnawed at me as I watched.

He unlocked it with a soft click, revealing an array of makeup: palettes from brands like Dior and MAC, liners, shadows, lipsticks—all high-end stuff that probably cost more than my monthly diner tips. 

My jaw dropped a little.

“When did you get into makeup, Aaron?” I blurted, eyeing the contents.

A small smile tugged at his lips. “When I got stuck with a roommate who couldn’t even nail a basic lip combo.”

He was mocking me, but playfully. 

My mind flashed back to a particular awkward day; the company picnic my boss at the diner had hosted.

I’d tried to make an effort, to look a little less tired and plain. But after several failed attempts, I’d given up and settled for a simple gloss.

Aaron had been right there in the living room, hunched over his laptop with headphones clamped on, totally zoned out. Or so I’d thought.

“How did you even know about that?” I asked, surprised.

He rolled his eyes, his smirk deepening. “Four years sharing this place, Jess. Even the damn furniture knows your strengths, and your epic fails. Now shut up and let me work.”

He selected a lip liner, his warm fingers sliding under my chin to tilt my face up toward the light.

Did he really buy all this, and learn how to use it just for me? The thoughts of that made my heart thundered so loudly I swore the neighbors could hear it through the thin walls.

His breath fanned my skin as he leaned in, focused on drawing precise lines on my lips.

Every cell in my body screamed to reach up, grab his neck, and close the gap between us—pull him into the kiss I’d fantasized about a thousand times.

And God, the way he looked focused wasn’t helping: brows furrowed in concentration, jaw clenched, those honey-brown eyes locked on my lips with an intensity that made the hair on my skin to stand at attention.

Aaron was going to be the death of me someday, I was sure of it. And the crazy part? I’d thank him.

Sleeping Beauty.
Jessica’s Pov

“How much longer, Aaron?” I hissed, annoyance creeping into my voice.

We’d been on this endless stretch of highway for nearly two hours now, and he’d conveniently forgotten to mention the drive would feel like a cross-country marathon.

“If you ask me that one more time, Jess, I’ll pull over and leave you on the side of the road,” he snapped back, his eyes glued to the asphalt ahead.

I bit back a retort, stealing a glance at him instead. He looked good—too good—like he’d stepped out of one of those brooding hero ads.

The way the late afternoon sun slanted through the windshield, highlighting the sharp line of his jaw.

I wished I could just blurt out what was really swirling in my head: ‘Stop being such an ass and tell me you feel this pull too, or at least turn on some music to drown out the silence.’

But nope. I just huffed dramatically and turned away, fixing my gaze on the rolling hills blurring past.

The city had vanished in the rearview long ago, replaced by lazy suburban sprawl—farmhouses with wraparound porches, vast cattle ranches where cows grazed around.

The fading sun painted everything in a flaming orange glow that screamed old-school Texas—peaceful, nostalgic, like we’d tumbled into a ’90s Western. It was almost soothing, if not for the tension coiling between us.

“Can we roll down the windows?” I asked, still not looking at him, my voice softer now, laced with the fatigue.

I half-expected him to ignore me or grumble about the wind messing up his hair, but he didn’t. The AC hummed to a stop, and he cracked the windows, even sliding open the sunroof.

A rush of cool evening air flooded in, tangy with earth and wildflowers.

I propped my chin on the door rest, letting my eyelids flutter shut as the breeze tangled my hair and soothed the itch under my skin.

For a moment, it was perfect; just the whoosh of wind, the hum of tires on pavement, and a fleeting illusion of eternal peace.

I didn’t mean to doze off. The view was too pretty to waste, but exhaustion from the day’s activities caught up to me.

One minute I was tracing lazy cloud shapes; the next, everything faded to black.

Aaron’s Pov

“Jess, pull your head in, we’re hitting a bumpy stretch,” I said, keeping my eyes locked on the winding road ahead, the gravel already crunching under the tires.

There was no response. Not a twitch, not even a sarcastic eye-roll from the passenger seat, and It pissed me off.

Why was she so damn stubborn? Always pushing back, always testing the edges of my patience like it was a game only she knew the rules to.

“Jess,” I growled, the word coming out sharper than I meant, infused with that frustration she somehow always dragged out of me.

Still nothing. I blew out a frustrated breath, and eased off the gas, hitting the brakes until the car rolled to a dusty stop on the shoulder.

The engine ticked softly in the sudden quiet as I twisted in my seat, ready to scold her—tell her she was impossible, infuriating, a walking headache.

But then I saw her: Her head was lolled against the door, lips parted in the softest breath, lashes fanned out like dark wings on her cheeks.

She was out cold, asleep against the door like the world had paused just for her nap.

How the hell was that even possible? Head bobbing with every bump, wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, and she crashes out like it’s a damn hammock on a beach.

Every damn day, Jessica Reid proved why she was wired different, unique in ways that snuck up and punched me in the gut.

I’d thought I had her mapped after living with her under the same roof, but nope, she’d unlock another facet, like today, dozing off mid-ride as if defying physics was her superpower. 

I reached over, my hand wrapping gently around her soft arm, and tugged her back from the door.

She stirred with a sleepy mumble, something incoherent about “cookies” or “monsters,” her head lolling to the side before settling against the headrest.

She remained knocked out. Classic Jess: she could crash anywhere when exhaustion hit, even if it was the ninth circle of hell. She was stubborn in sleep, too.

Cursing softly, I killed the engine and hopped out, the cooling evening air nipping at my skin, carrying the earthy smell of fields and pines.

I circled to her side, popping the door open with a quiet creak. She didn’t budge, so I slid one arm under her knees, the other behind her back, and lifted her like she weighed nothing.

God, she fit against me perfectly, her body molding to my chest as she nestled in with a contented sigh, mumbling nonsense again.

Her scent wrapped around me, a soft mix of vanilla lotion and sun-warmed skin, and for a second, I just stood there, holding her in the fading light, the world narrowing to the steady rise and fall of her breath.

Shaking off my thoughts, I juggled the back door open with my elbow, then eased her onto the wide leather seat, laying her down as gently as I could.

The dress she’d fought so hard to downplay rode up in the shift, revealing those smooth, beautiful thighs—golden in the sunset glow, curves that begged to be traced.

I should’ve looked away. Hell, I tried to—force my eyes back to the road, the dashboard, anything. But I couldn’t. She was a vision to behold, even unconscious.

It’s been four years of this torture: overlooking the treasure sleeping mere feet from my bed, sharing breaths in the dark. I’d tried to tune it out, but failed miserably.

Her scent lingering in the mornings, that faint vanilla trail pulling me from sleep. The little giggles turning into snorts when she got lost in one of her novels, curled up on the couch like a cat in a sunbeam.

The way she cared without fanfare: slipping those water bottle into my gym bag, cooking meals that warmed more than my stomach, sneaking to the court bleachers to watch from the shadows, her face lighting up when I nailed a shot. I saw it all.

Jessica had turned into my obsession, a subject I’d majored in secretly—like prepping for a final where acing it meant decoding her soul.

Every detail about her is engraved in me: my soul, my brain, my blood, my damn marrow.

From the freckles dusting her nose, the way her laugh crinkled her eyes, how her fingers twisted in her lap when she was nervous.

Her soulful blue eyes, lighting up like summer skies whenever I brought home something small—a coffee from her favorite spot, a dog-eared book I pretended to “find” at the store. She was grateful for crumbs.

I hear her muffled sobs some nights, probably stressing over “owing” me, cries she thought didn’t reach my ears. But I didn’t want repayment. Never had. And I couldn’t explain why, not even to myself.

Sometimes I wonder if she knows how much I notice.

When I caught Fiona riding my cousin that night, I swore I was done. No more love, no more emotional crap. Women were for the night, nothing deeper.

But life? That bitch loved her jokes.

The universe dropped the one girl I’d spent years teasing, tormenting, right back at my doorstep, wide-eyed and desperate for a roof over her head.

Jess had never been ugly. Christ, she was the kind of beautiful that could eclipse any beauty standard, the sort that lodged in your chest and stayed, generation after generation: full lips begging kisses, eyes holding oceans, a body sculpted for worship.

Too bad she buried it all under hoodies and baggy pants, armor against the world… and against assholes like me, who’d helped forge her insecurities.

I can’t justify what I did back then. I was a punk kid, a full-blown jerk who got off on the power trip of making eyes water, thinking it made me tough.

Jess was collateral, an easy target for my cruel entertainment.

Sometimes, late at night, I’d replay it all: the teasing, the laughter, the way she looked hurt but tried to smile anyway. And I’d hate myself for it.

If I could crank back the clock, and erase those scars I’d left, I would.

I’d tell her then what I barely admit now: You’re stunning, Jess. That body of yours? It’s a masterpiece. Hips I’d kill to grip during a slow dance, thighs I’d bury my face in until you forgot your own name, an ass that haunts my dreams like the perfect pillow after a long day on the court.

What I feel for Jess, I don’t know. It’s an infatuation, raw and unnamed—not love, not hate, just this magnetic pull that defies labels.

I crave her presence like oxygen, the way she makes the house feel like home, and her existence that lit up the corners of my world I didn’t know were dark.

I want to keep her smiling for real, make her feel safe and worthy, make her understand that she deserves the world. But I’m held back by my own fears of hurting her.

I notice how her eyes go soft when she’s around me, that crush growing quiet but strong, a secret she protects fiercely. Maybe it’s even deeper than a crush now.

And if I encourage it, build it up, only to let it crash? I’d break her heart completely.

Her family doesn’t give a damn about her, and that’s a big reason I quit being mean to her years ago, once I saw how deep it cut through her already empty life.

Jessica needs real love, the kind that floods in full, from someone whole, not cracked like me.

Fiona’s betrayal still has hooks in me, old pieces I can’t shake loose. My heart’s a total mess—twisted up in ways I can’t even sort out or explain without sounding like a loser.

But one thing’s crystal clear: I’d protect Jess with everything I’ve got, even my life.

In eight months, she’ll wrap college, launch into whatever wild dream she’s chasing (journalism, probably—exposing truths like she unearths mine without trying). She’ll move from this apartment, from me, and good for her.

Maybe she’ll find someone who looks at her the way she wish I could.

Until then, we’ll keep up this little game; the fake dating, the teasing, the banter that makes everything feel less complicated than it is.

Let fate roll the dice, I’m dying to see where it lands.

I pressed a soft kiss to the back of her palm, her skin warm and soft against my lips, then eased it down to rest on her stomach.

I got back behind the wheel, opened a bottle of water she’d thoughtfully packed for us, and took a long gulp before starting the engine again.

I pulled back onto the road, the manor just thirty minutes out now.

Whatever waited there—family interrogations, Fiona’s taunting smile… I’d face it. For her. For us, even if it was pretend.",1,1768016800.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1q8tnwc,https://i.redd.it/hy7f2lza1gcg1.png,"[DIY Prototype] I’m an engineer tired of wobbly desk converters. Here’s the sketch for my ""over-engineered"" heavy-duty riser. What am I missing?","Hi everyone,

As I mentioned in a previous post, I love my current desk and don't want to replace it, but I need to stand. I’ve tried a few market risers, but the ""monitor shake"" every time I type drives me crazy, and the keyboard trays are always too small.

So, I’m using my background in engineering to design my own.

**My goal with this prototype (pictured):**

* **Rock-Solid Stability:** Using a wider base and heavier materials to eliminate wobble.
* **Massive Work Surface:** Enough room for a full-sized keyboard, mouse, and maybe a coffee mug without feeling cramped.

**Where I need your help:** Before I move from sketch to build, I want to ask the daily users here:

1. **Ergonomics:** Looking at the sketch, does the keyboard tray size seem right for long-term use?
2. **Features:** Is there a ""quality of life"" feature (like integrated cable channels or a specific lift mechanism) that you wish your current riser had?

I want to build this once and build it right. Any feedback on the design is appreciated!",1,1768016682.0,StandingDesks,0,1.0,False

1q8tl8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q8tl8e/you_are_designated/,You Are Designated,"What good's a designated driver without a car? Nick and Tessa stumble behind you out of the bar, leaning on each other for support and trading loud whispers. You're relieved at the sight of your black sedan, eager to sleep. At a distance, the fob doesn't work. The familiar double flash of the headlights doesn't come, even when you're standing  next to the car. Bracing yourself with a hand on the roof, you try the key. It turns a full 360 degrees and you pull back with clenched teeth; someone tried to break in. As you try the lock on the passenger side, you pull out your phone. The door won't unlock and neither will your phone. No amount of button smashing lights the screen.

Nick's phone won't turn on. Neither will Tessa's when you eventually convince her to hand it over. You're not worried yet. It is a freak coincidence but not beyond belief that all four batteries could die without notice and that a stranger broke the lock. But your phone is in your front pocket and you keep taking it out to check if it's miraculously resurrected.

""Let's get walking then,"" you announce, heading toward home. 

Your friends follow you with quickly sobering complaints, camping backpacks rattling as they adjust their weight. They had spent the last few months walking a thousand miles so what was a couple more? The promise of warm blankets gives you the burst of energy you need to sprint the last block to the front door. It's so close, your bed and half a beer await your gracious return.

The key slips into the lock and... spins. One then two then three full rotations. You yank it back and kick the door before trying again. This time you lean all your weight into the door as you turn. It yields the same result but you slip and the key snaps with the weight of your body behind it.

For a moment you can't help but stare in disbelief at your mistake. ""Are you fucking kidding?"" you ask helplessly.

Nick and Tessa are behind you now. You turn around to show them the half key you still hold.

""Ah fuck that,"" Tessa growls. She runs up to the nearest window and starts pounding and yelling. You don't stop her. You join in. When you finally give up, at least you're warm from running around the apartment building. It's then you realize Nick has set up his backpacking tent.

""Let's sleep please,"" he says, holding open the nylon door flap.

Camping out on the sidewalk is strange sensation. Plus, it's a two person tent and it barely holds the three of you.  For a while you're pissed, curled up with your friends on the street like your memory foam mattress isn't fifty steps away. But it's so quiet you start to forget where you are. Packed this tight, it's almost hot and you sleep. 

**-2-**

Morning is the color of a ripening orange that still remembers being green. Bright, cloud scattered sunlight filters through the tent, illuminating your tangled bodies. You sit up, ignoring Tessa swearing at you, to open the door. With more swearing, you exit onto the concrete and look around. 

By the height of the winter sun, you ration it must be late in the morning. Usually cars are honking outside your window and people are getting in each other's ways. It's a main road through the city. You can't think of any good reason it should be so empty. Entirely empty. Not a single parked car, no hurried business men, no trash bags, no scattered coffee cups. You turn to look at your building, expecting to see someone staring down at the idiots that missed the stay at home order. 

But no, all the windows are white with the reflected sky. Even the windows you remember holding flags and political signs are blank. You still aren't panicking, your brain won't let you until you've eliminated every rational scenario and surely you can find one.

""Guys come look,"" you say, patting the top of the tent.

""You got the door open?"" Nick asks, pushing a disheveled head into the cold air. 

You don't respond, you instead start walking up the street to see if it's normal.

""What do you want?"" Tessa's voice is almost overtaken by the sound of rustling as she struggles out of the tent.

You're expecting to be yelled at by your two friends but they're as quiet as the city. It's so quiet you can hear their feet scuffing the pavement. When you hear running you know it's Tessa, she can never stand still when she's stressed. You return to where Nick is standing and he's turning in a slow circle, eyes bulging.

When Tessa returns, she reports the bizarre emptiness for blocks. Empty sidewalks, roads, windows, gutters. Your stomach aches and Nick is holding a hand over his eyes, swaying with dizziness. You all decide to sit and eat and think. The tent zipper sticks as you open it to rest on the mattress pads. 

Breakfast is cold and sparse. Your friends packed well for their trip so there's not much food left. One MRE, electrolyte powder, a handful of granola bars, and a water bottle. It's not enough food for a day. You'll all be fine once you find a way inside, no problem. And you eat like it won't be a problem. When you're done, the bars are gone and your water is half empty.

""It was an evacuation,"" Tessa offers. 

You whisper 'no' to yourself, thinking of the streets cleaner than they've ever been in your life.

""Shelter in place?"" Nick asks the universe.

""No,"" you whisper. Where are the cars?

""The rapture!"" Tessa exclaims. 

""No,"" you retort. You aren't the three sole sinners in town.

""Aliens?"" Nick asks quiet as if little green men are listening. 

You press your face into your hands as your heart begins to race. This is it, you are finally panicking. You're in a different world, probably have been since you left the bar last night. The worst part is not knowing how you got there. 

There's quiet for an awful minute before Tessa speaks. ""What do we do?"" Her excitement over the novelty of your situation has run out and she sounds like a child. 

It's quiet again and when you lift up your head to see why, your friends are waiting for you to have a solution. If you can't give them something you know your thumping heartbeat will become a full-blown meltdown.

""I think we need to get out of the city,"" you say. It's your first thought. Cities are magnets for death and destruction so the suburbs will be safe.

The three of you pack up and let Nick take the lead. Despite his hangover, dulled by sunglasses and a baseball cap, his sense of direction is good. You recognize bits and pieces of the city that remind you of trips to the beach. You never venture this far east if you can help it. You don't stop for lunch, none of you have an appetite and the movement keeps you warm. The jacket you wear is only good for going between heated car to heated building. 

When you stop for the night, it's because Tessa is complaining about her feet. Nick sets up the tent as you heat up a hermetically sealed pouch of ravioli and Tessa checks her blisters. It smells like fake cheese and sour tomatoes as you drift off and you think you'd feel like a king sleeping on the floor of a shitty pizzeria. 

**-3-**

The next morning the city continues on. Nick swears they should be hitting tree line sidewalks of two story family homes. And yet the familiar repetition of apartments, corporate skyscrapers,  and chain restaurants continues abated.

You stop for lunch on a bus stop bench. There used to be more covered bus shelters, you waited under one last weekend after drinks with your coworkers. The three of you touch shoulders and arms as you share tough bread with fake cheese. The bars between the seats prevent you from getting closer for warmth. Tessa let you borrow her extra shirt but it doesn't help at all. 

You start walking before your friends are ready. If you don't get your blood moving you're afraid you'll get stuck, frozen to the metal bench. Your shoulders are pulled to your ears as you walk, eyes down so all your focus is on your numb feet.

""Could we get on a roof?"" Tessa asks. ""See where to go?""

You shrug, Nick speaks. ""If you can find a fire escape, go for it.""

""What do you think?"" Tessa is asking you directly. 

You look to her, eyes watering and painfully cold. ""Anything that gets me home,"" you tell her.

Walking resumes but now with energy as Tessa is excited to have a project. She runs back and forth across the street to check the adjoining alleyways for a reachable ladder. Nick walks on one side of the sidewalk and you the other in case your third misses something. Time passes slow with disappointment.

You're ready to give up, the sun is setting, when Tessa yells with excitement. Nick jogs over to her and you follow at a walk. Your friend is already pulling herself up the metal rungs of a fire escape. You notice that even though she's hanging onto the sliding portion of the ladder her weight doesn't move it. There's a closed dumpster pulled under the fire escape so that she could reach. You and Nick watch her, anxious at what she might find. Secretly, you worry she'll fall. 

You're pacing to stay warm, no longer paying attention to Tessa by the time she reaches the top. Nick is beside you when she does, nudging you to look up. You look in time to see the silhouette of Tessa waving against the orange sun before she vanishes over the roof's edge. Actually holding your breath, you wait for news. But you're losing feeling in your face as Tessa takes too long to tell you what she sees.

Nick starts into the street, looking for your friend. ""Tessa?"" he yells, voice stuttering through his chattering teeth. ""You okay?""

There's a beat of silence before a scream pierces the air. ""Tess?!"" You join in Nick's frantic calls. She doesn't respond, she just screams and screams, louder than you ever thought she was capable. There's a pause and you hear the distinct sound of gagging but there isn't anything for her to vomit. 

""I'm coming up!"" Nick announces. You grab his arm as he moves to run. You know it would be dangerous to follow.

""No!"" Tessa seems to reply. But then she repeats it, over and over until it's noise. ""No! NO! NO! NONONONONONONO-"" She stops to gag and cough and then you hear her feet pound the solid roof. You can barely see her against the darkening sky. But you can hear her coming. She's trying to yell and cough at the same time so it comes out as a wordless animal bellow. 

Tessa is going too fast, when she comes around the corners you hear her whole body smash into the railing. You watch as her shadow partially runs, mostly falls, down the next flight of steps. She's still halfway up the 10 story building so when her momentum carries her over a rail and you close your eyes. Nick screams and runs, you can barely hear Tess hit the ground over his worry.

You heave a breath and pick up the two backpacks that were left behind. By the time Nick returns from Tess's body, the tent is up and you're huddled in her sleeping bag, numb from your brain through your toes. Nick is breathing ragged, hiccuping with unshed tears that dehydration keeps at bay. He leans through the front of the tent and puts your dead friend's jacket in your lap. You don it, shivering in the down sleeping bag alone. It's been dark and getting colder by the time you and Nick curl together for a long night. 

**-4-**

Nick is missing when you wake. He left his bag, mostly empty MRE package open on top. He can't be far. Vinegar packet and almonds clutched in one hand, you leave the tent and close it after you as though you can trap the heat inside. From across the street, you can see Nick crouched in the alley where Tess lays. You walk over, getting close enough to just see the tips of her boots. One is the opposite way of the other.

""You eat?"" you ask Nick flatly.

He stands from the body and presses a hand to his mouth. When he reaches you, you offer him the almonds but he shakes his head.

""Let's go,"" he says. You don't argue. You don't know where you're going but you have to try, don't you? 

Something is wrong when you reach the tent. Nick says the zipper is stuck but the whole front door refuses to move, his yanking doesn't wrinkle the fabric like it should. You try the zipper and it's like pulling at a nail in a brick wall. The tent is somehow solid. The two of you scratch and bite and kick at the solid mass that used to be a shelter. You give up after Nick's stripped his pants to use the zipper as a knife. What is supposed to be nylon shows no sign of damage, you might as well have tried blowing it down.

Silently Nick pulls back on his jeans, shivering hard. You split what's left of the nuts and the vinegarbefore walking. You have no plan and soon you won't have any energy to move, the only thing keeping your limbs soft. So you walk without rest. Inevitably the night comes and you curl together in the deep door way of building. You have all cover on three sides but it doesn't keep the cold out. 

**-5-**

You wake and you're cold, colder than you should be with Nick at your back. The pressure of him is still there, the warmth isn't. ""Nick?"" you ask.

His corpse is silent in return, only providing you with the sand bag weight of his body. You wonder how long he's been dead, cooling and loosening as you sleep.

Freezer burnt thoughts keep you laying on the ground with the body until pins and needles erupt in your lower legs. A soft fear that this is the feeling of death sends enough adrenaline through your system to get you on your feet. You start walking just to walk. Eventually, your legs feel better and you're actually warming up. You don't need Tessa's jacket anymore and discard in the middle of the road. Hypothermia is slowly becoming a friend; you haven't felt this comfortable in days.

Walking brings you to a familiar place. The abandoned tent is bright orange in the distance. You approach and walk past only to stop in front of an alley. Tessa is where you left her, the yellow treads of her boots acting as her grave marker. You wonder what she saw, what was so awesome she died avoiding it. Your eyes drift up to the roof. There's a flash of fear in the back of your mind but the urgency of your curiosity wins and drags you forward. Your hands burn on the frozen metal of the dumpster as you scramble on top. Standing on the plastic lid, you inspect your palms and they're purple instead of red. That's fine, all you care is that they can pull you up the dozen ladder rungs.

The clang of your body on metal and your own rough breathing create a steady rhythm for you to climb to. Your lungs aren't cooperating and you have to push harder the higher you get. When you're forced to stop by swimming vision, you've stripped your own jacket. Your skin is burning.

You continue to the roof with wooshing breaths, the air feels thinner. But you're so close. You force yourself to keep moving onto and up the final ladder even though you're permanently seeing double. When you stop to look, it'll clear. Finally your hand grabs onto brick instead of metal and you know you're there. Now you can't stop even if you wanted. Your body is moving on its own. Even though something is wrong with the sky. Even though the air you're breathing is foul. Even though the wind doesn't sound like wind and it sounds more like Tessa. You've made it over the edge.",1,1768016457.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

this place is expensive. the kerrytown district is the spot for unique local places and it's super walkable to the university of michigan campus. that walkability is why home sale prices are insane. the median home sale price in kerrytown was like 2.0 million dollars recently. rentals are obviously super competitive. you're paying for the location and the charm. think old west side or kerrytown for a historic vibe. roosroast is a local favorite with a downtown and rosewood st location. the issue here is parking, which is a nightmare. if you do get a spot, you can make some passive income and help students by listing it on prked. renting out your driveway or unused garage space is super easy to set up and you set the price and schedule.  
  
athens, georgia (university of georgia)  
  
if you're looking for something newer and upscale that's still walkable, check out places like the mill district. it's less than a mile from downtown athens and the boulevard historic district. it has its own shops and dining right on-site. a 1-bedroom there is starting around 1570 dollars and a 2-bedroom is up around 2590 dollars. that's premium living for the area. a more typical 1-bedroom in the greater athens area averages around 1173 dollars, so you're paying a lot more for that walk-to-coffee convenience. hendershots coffee bar is a staple in a great area nearby. keep in mind that even though parts of the mill district are pedestrian-friendly, a car is still necessary for a lot of errands in the area.  
  
general tips for coffee-centric areas  
  
1. always check walkability scores. being near one great coffee shop is nice, but you want to be in a neighborhood where you can walk to three or four, plus a grocery store.  
2. prepare for high rents. property near college campuses is always in demand, and property near \*desirable\* coffee shops is even more so. you will pay a premium.  
3. consider grad student areas. look for areas a little further out that are popular with grad students, as they tend to be quieter tenants but still want easy access to good study/coffee spots. you might find something slightly cheaper and safer for your car. prked is great for finding vip parking closer than the public lots and it's usually way cheaper. you can message the host for updates or pics, which feels safer than street parking.

Back when we lived in Scottsdale, La Grande Orange was our go-to for this type of thing; lots of great pastries plus coffee and beer/wine options.

hey y'all i figured i'd share some real talk since i live right near all the homecoming madness too. this parade is a blast but living close means you gotta plan around the absolute traffic nightmare.  
  
first thing is parking. seriously, get your car off the street early. like, way earlier than you think. most schools put up signs saying no parking starting at 4pm for a 6pm parade, and they will ticket and tow you faster than you can say 'school spirit'. i'm talking get it moved by noon on friday, or whenever the parade is. if you have a driveway or garage you don't use, you should list it on prked. it's super easy to set up for passive income, set your own price, and since people coming for the parade are desperate for parking, you'll make some decent money.  
  
if you need to park \*your\* car during the parade because your street parking is gone, check out prked too. you can find someone's unused driveway or garage nearby which is way cheaper and feels safer than trying to snag a spot in one of the campus decks that will be closed for entry/exit during the whole event. saves you from the parking chaos and getting trapped by road closures.  
  
speaking of road closures, check the university website's transportation section. they publish the exact route and what roads close and when. some major arteries around campus can shut down hours before the parade even starts, sometimes as early as 430pm. this means you might not be able to even get into or out of your street until 7 or 8pm, so plan your dinner and errands accordingly.  
  
also, be ready for noise and crowds. homecoming is a 24-hour party for some people, especially the undergrads and alums. if the parade route is near you, the crowds get pretty big and loud. stock up on snacks and drinks (stay hydrated!) so you don't have to venture out during the peak craziness.  
  
my best tip for watching is to get there early if you want a good spot. bring a folding chair, maybe some donuts or coffee if it's a morning parade. it's worth it to see the elaborate floats and all the energy.  
  
hope this helps a fellow campus resident survive the hoco weekend. good luck!",1,1768016132.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Since we have moved, I have noticed that he is always on his phone texting a group of people he met online. At first I did not look into it much, but literally every time I see him or am around him he is on it, and this has been the case for a couple of months now at this point. This particularly frustrates me when we are planning to spend time together to watch a movie/show or go out for a coffee etc, and he spends the whole time texting these friends and not paying attention or living in the moment. Sometimes he will even leave his phone rested on his leg, with the group chat open as he watches the messages come through in real time rather than watching what is on or conversing like we normally would. It is at the point where he also does this same thing in work, rather than working. This is how I know it is not a personal thing against me necessarily, but I don’t know how to approach him about it without sounding rude or overbearing. I do love my friend so I don’t want an argument but I am also fed up of feeling like he doesn’t care about spending time with me and would rather be on his phone. It takes me out of the moment when I notice him doing it, and admittedly I have become hyper aware of these tendencies, but it has made me less interested in wanting to spend time together watching things.

1q8te5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q8te5n/how_to_enjoy_being_alone_without_turning_into_a/,How to Enjoy Being Alone Without Turning Into a Hermit: The Psychology Behind Actually Liking Your Own Company,"So here's the thing nobody talks about: we're all terrified of being alone. Like genuinely scared. I spent months diving into research on this, books, podcasts, psychology papers, and realized most of us have completely misunderstood what solitude actually means. We've been conditioned to see alone time as punishment, as something wrong with us, as a gap that needs filling immediately with noise or people or scrolling. But that's BS.

The real issue isn't being alone. it's that we never learned how to be comfortable in our own company. Society glorifies constant connection, busyness, packed schedules. Being alone got rebranded as loneliness somewhere along the way, and we internalized that. Your brain isn't broken for struggling with this, it's actually responding exactly how it was trained to respond. But the cool part? You can retrain it. And when you do, being alone stops feeling like deprivation and starts feeling like freedom.

**The first shift is understanding solitude vs loneliness.** Loneliness is that hollow ache, that feeling of disconnection even in a crowded room. Solitude is intentional, chosen, rejuvenating. The psychologist Sherry Turkle talks about this in her work on reclaiming conversation, how we've become so afraid of being alone that we're losing the capacity for self reflection. Without solitude, you can't actually know yourself. You're just reacting to everyone else's energy all the time, performing different versions of yourself. Real talk, some of my best ideas and clearest thinking happened when I stopped filling every silent moment with podcasts or texts or whatever. Just sitting there, being bored, letting my mind wander. Sounds basic but it's actually hard as hell at first.

**Reframe alone time as investment in yourself, not isolation from others.** Start small. Like genuinely small. Take yourself on a solo coffee run without your phone. Sit in a park for 20 minutes doing nothing. The discomfort you feel? That's normal. Your brain is essentially going through withdrawal from constant stimulation. Dr. Sara Maitland wrote this incredible book called **A Book of Silence** where she explores different types of silence and solitude across cultures and history. She's a novelist and scholar who literally moved to rural Scotland to experience extended solitude, won awards for her writing, and her insights are insanely good. This book will make you question everything you think you know about needing constant company. She breaks down how silence and solitude have been sources of creativity, spiritual growth, and psychological depth for centuries. After reading it, I genuinely stopped seeing alone time as something to escape and started protecting it.

**Build routines that you actually enjoy doing solo.** Not productive routines necessarily, just things that feel good. Morning walks, cooking elaborate meals for yourself, learning an instrument, whatever clicks. The author Mason Currey documented this in **Daily Rituals**, profiling how hundreds of creative people structured their days, and spoiler alert, most of them carved out significant alone time. It's a compilation of routines from artists, writers, scientists, and you realize that solitude was integral to their best work. Makes you feel less weird about needing it.

**Use tech mindfully when alone.** This sounds preachy but hear me out. There's a massive difference between choosing to watch a movie alone versus compulsively scrolling because silence feels uncomfortable. One is intentional enjoyment, the other is avoidance. The app **Medito** is actually clutch for building comfort with stillness. it's a completely free meditation app, no subscriptions, no upsells, just guided practices that help you sit with yourself. Some people hate meditation but honestly it's just practicing being present in your own head without judgment. Start with like 5 minutes. You'd be surprised how chatty and critical your inner voice is when you actually listen to it, and how much that softens with practice.

Another resource worth checking out is **BeFreed**, an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts. What makes it different is how it customizes both the content and the learning plan based on what you're specifically working on, like building comfort with solitude or understanding your own patterns better. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples when something really clicks. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way more digestible. It pulls from science-based sources and creates an adaptive learning plan that evolves as you progress. Been using it during walks and it's replaced a lot of mindless scrolling time, which has genuinely helped clear up some of that mental noise.

**Examine your fear of missing out.** FOMO is such a real thing and it makes solitude feel threatening. You're alone on a Friday night and suddenly your brain is like ""everyone else is out having the time of their lives and you're a loser."" Except that's not reality, that's anxiety talking. The research from social psychologist Sherry Turkle and others shows that people who are comfortable being alone actually form deeper connections with others because they're not desperate for validation or distraction. They choose connection from a place of wanting it, not needing it. That's powerful.

**Create a space that feels like yours.** Physical environment matters more than people realize. Clean your room, add plants, get lighting that doesn't feel like a hospital. Make your space somewhere you genuinely want to be. When your environment feels good, being alone in it feels different. Less like confinement, more like sanctuary.

The shift from dreading alone time to enjoying it isn't instant. It's gradual, sometimes uncomfortable, definitely worth it. You start noticing things about yourself, your actual preferences, not just what you've absorbed from others. You become better company for yourself, which weirdly makes you better company for others too. You stop needing people to complete you or distract you, and relationships become about genuine connection instead of filling voids.

Being comfortable alone doesn't mean you become some antisocial hermit. It means you have a choice. You can enjoy solitude AND meaningful relationships. They're not opposing forces, they actually feed each other. Once you stop running from yourself, everything else clicks into place differently.",2,1768015879.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve felt like she avoids me. She hangs out with another friend much more than with me, and when I invite her to do something, she often doesn’t respond or says yes and then it turns into no. I finally told her how I felt — that it hurts to feel avoided, especially when I’m always willing to go wherever she wants (coffee, restaurant, her house, my house, anywhere). I even told her I’d been wanting to talk to her for a while but didn’t because I felt like she wouldn’t answer.

I also explained that I don’t hang out much with her larger group because it makes me uncomfortable due to past issues with some of those people. I told her that I mostly talk to her and one other friend, and that I genuinely try to spend time with her because she’s very important to me. I even mentioned that I’ve spent months thinking about her birthday gift because I care that much.

She responded apologizing and saying she wasn’t avoiding me intentionally. She said she ignored my invitation because she knew her parents wouldn’t be able to take her and she didn’t want to disappoint me. She admitted that ignoring me was wrong but said that’s how she deals with problems. She also said she sometimes avoids answering because she was afraid we’d have this exact conversation again. She admitted she’s been a bad friend, said she hasn’t been well emotionally either, and apologized for how she’s treated me.

After that, I told her how I really feel: that we always return to the same situation where I’m the one trying and trying to do things together, while she says no or says yes and then cancels, and that she never initiates anything with me. I told her that if spending time with me isn’t something she enjoys, then I understand she shouldn’t force herself. What hurt me the most is that after I left another friend group, she and others told me they were happy I was finally with people who truly cared about me — and now it feels like that wasn’t true.

I know she has her own struggles, and I don’t think she’s a bad person. But I’m exhausted from feeling unwanted and like an option rather than a priority.

* Emotionally available without being exhausting

Locally there are billboards for some website ""I Got Hurt In Jersey.com"", which I think is for some ambulance chaser law firm. Recently a Spanish version of the billboards has been showing up, ""Me Lastimé En Jersey.com"". This translation confuses me, because it appears to be translating the English passive with Spanish reflexive passive, which I think is not right here, because then the implication is that the subject hurt themselves (e.g, cut themselves chopping food, banged their shin on their coffee table) rather than that they got hurt through no fault of their own (e.g. slipping on ice, somebody T-bones your car, whatever).

My first assumption was that there is some nuance to how they are using it or it's a customary idiom, because this is North Jersey and how would they mess it up when there are like a million bilingual Spanish speakers in a 20 mile radius and surely a large number of qualified professional translators?

It’s easy to blame it on stress, trauma, or burnout, but the truth is, a lot of low key habits and modern day lifestyle choices are quietly feeding our anxiety daily without us realizing it.

This post isn’t about preaching. It’s meant to unpack some sneaky anxiety triggers backed by legit research stuff you won’t catch from a 12 second TikTok by some influencer with zero actual knowledge. All the insights here are pulled from verified sources like *The Huberman Lab Podcast*, *The Journal of Anxiety Disorders*, and behavioral science research from Harvard and Stanford.

If you’ve been feeling anxious but can’t figure out why, here are 6 overlooked triggers that might be messing with you and what to do instead.

   

* **Caffeine… especially on an empty stomach**
  * *Andrew Huberman (neurobiologist at Stanford)* breaks this down beautifully. In one of his episodes, he explains how caffeine reduces adenosine (the chemical that makes you feel sleepy), which is great for alertness but also triggers your body’s stress response.
  * Drinking coffee first thing without food? That’s like pouring gasoline on a nervous system already dealing with cortisol spikes from waking up.
  * In a 2022 study from *Nutrients Journal*, researchers found that high caffeine intake significantly increases anxiety symptoms, especially in sensitive individuals.
  * *Fix:* Try drinking it 90 minutes after waking and eat something first. Even a banana helps slow the cortisol peak.

* **Not enough morning sunlight**
  * Light is medicine for your brain. A lack of sunlight disrupts your circadian rhythm and messes with your dopamine and serotonin two essential chemicals for regulating mood and stress.
  * A 2020 paper in *Frontiers in Psychology* noted that people who get less than 30 minutes of morning light had significantly higher anxiety scores.
  * Morning light tells your brain it’s time to wake up, which sets the tone for cortisol balance for the entire day.
  * *Fix:* Get outside within 30 minutes of waking up. You don’t need direct sun just daylight on your skin and eyes for 10 minutes helps a ton.

* **Too much scrolling, not enough social**
  * There’s a difference between passive consumption (doomscrolling) and active connection (FaceTiming a close friend).
  * The *American Journal of Preventive Medicine* found in their study of 1,787 adults that individuals with high social media use were 2.7X more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.
  * The problem isn’t the phone it’s **how** we use it.
  * *Fix:* Limit passive apps (like IG, TikTok) to 30 minutes a day. Use that time to call a friend or do something IRL with someone. Quality > quantity.

* **Always needing a Plan B**
  * Sounds smart in theory, right? But living in constant backup mode trains your brain to expect failure before anything even goes wrong.
  * Harvard psychologist Dr. Daniel Gilbert has studied how impact bias makes us overestimate how bad things will feel if they go wrong so we pre plan our disappointment and unknowingly keep ourselves in a low level threat state.
  * *Fix:* Make the plan. Commit. Don’t always prep for disaster. Training yourself to sit with uncertainty builds actual resilience.

* **Perfectionism disguised as productivity**
  * People love to wear I’m a perfectionist like a badge, but psychology research shows that perfectionism is highly correlated with chronic anxiety.
  * According to a meta analysis in *Journal of Clinical Psychology*, perfectionistic tendencies especially the fear of making mistakes drive heightened anxiety responses, procrastination, and burnout.
  * *Fix:* Try the 90% rule from Greg McKeown’s *Effortless*: if something feels 90% good enough, ship it. Let done be better than perfect.

* **Low blood sugar crashes (aka ‘hangxiety’ is real)**
  * Skipping meals or eating only sugar/carbs causes blood glucose levels to spike fast, then crash that crash often feels *exactly* like anxiety: shakiness, irritability, racing thoughts.
  * A 2021 review in *Harvard Health* linked blood sugar instability with increased anxiety and panic symptoms.
  * *Fix:* Balance your plate. Add protein to every meal. Don’t go more than 4–5 hours without food. Think eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, tofu, or protein shakes.

   

These things may seem small, but they add up. Anxiety isn’t always about what’s happening around you it’s often what’s happening *inside* your nervous system. The good news? These are all learnable adjustments, not personality flaws.

If you’re into stuff like this and want to go deeper, some great resources to check out:

hey everyone, i figured i'd share some tips i've picked up living in a college neighborhood. the financial stress is real, and it’s super isolating sometimes. but there are definitely ways to make it less awful.  
  
first thing is always income. if you have extra space, like a parking spot you dont use, a driveway, or even part of your garage or basement for storage, you should list it on prked. it's one of the easiest ways to make passive income. a lot of students and commuters will pay good money to rent a spot near campus, especially when campus parking is a nightmare or super expensive. you set the price and schedule, and it's basically money for doing nothing. you can also try simple side hustles like freelancing (writing, graphic design) or dog walking. for real passive stuff, think about selling your old textbooks online or even your class notes if they are really good.  
  
on the cutting costs side, you have to be brutal with your budget. use an app like mint or a simple spreadsheet to track every dollar for a month to see where it all goes. rent should ideally be less than 30 percent of your income, so getting a few roommates is a lifesaver. that also splits utilities like internet, which can shock you if you're a first-time renter. always check if your landlord includes water or trash. i budgeted about $100 a month for utilities when they weren't included, and it saved me from a surprise bill in january.  
  
food is another big one. honestly, meal prepping is way cheaper and healthier. if you can budget for around $300 a month for groceries and cook at home, you save a ton over buying lunch every day. look for grocery stores that offer a student discount on a certain day of the week, sometimes it’s like 10-30 percent off. and brew your own coffee. i know, it sucks, but those $5 lattes add up to a couple hundred bucks a semester.  
  
also, never buy new textbooks if you can help it. check with your professor if an older edition is fine, then rent the used one or find a cheap pdf. use your student id everywhere for discounts. cancel any subscriptions you haven't used in the last month, like that streaming service you only watched for one show.  
  
if things are really tight, look into emergency aid grants from your college. a lot of schools have a student support fund for unexpected expenses like a medical bill or car repair. don't be afraid to ask your financial aid office. that's what those resources are for.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some ideas i've been looking into for making some extra cash since my place is super close to the main college campus. proximity is gold with students, honestly.  
  
the absolute easiest passive income stream is your parking. if you have an unused driveway, a garage, or even just extra curb space that you own, list it on prked. people are always looking for cheaper and closer parking than the campus lots, especially for game days or just full semesters. you literally just list your space on prked, set your own price and schedule, and it's super easy passive income. it takes almost no work once it's set up.  
  
the next big one, which is more involved, is renting out rooms. people i know who do this rent by the bedroom, not the whole house, and make way more money than a traditional family rental. you get multiple checks a month, which adds up. you just have to be firm but fair with your rules, and definitely include fast wifi and maybe even a cleaning service to keep your premium rent prices. some people convert basement or attic space into a separate apartment (an mil unit) with its own entrance for even more rental privacy and income.  
  
for less hassle, think about storage. when students go home for the summer or for breaks, they need somewhere to stash their stuff besides dragging it across the country. renting out a section of your garage or a dry basement corner for storage space can make you a few hundred bucks a season with minimal effort.  
  
if you have a large spare room or a finished office space, you could turn it into a premium, quiet study spot. campus libraries get loud and crowded during exam week. you can charge a low hourly or daily fee for a super quiet room with fast internet and a coffee maker. you can set up bookings on a simple calendar app to manage it.  
  
finally, don't forget short-term rentals like airbnb/vrbo. if your schedule is flexible, you can crush it during major events like graduation, homecoming, or big football/basketball games. people fly in for the weekend and are willing to pay way more for a place that's walking distance than a hotel miles away.  
  
hope this helps some other homeowners out there.",1,1768015171.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1q8swey,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1q8swey/looking_for_feedback_on_a_short_story_who_what/,"Looking for Feedback on a Short Story: Who, What, When, Wear, Why? (3,200 words)","Their clothes. That’s what I remember most about the day we met. The chestnut horses they rode were certainly handsome creatures, but the men’s uniforms really struck me. Each wore an identical navy overcoat affixed with polished gold buttons that glimmered in the sunlight. Large brass belt buckles held up trousers blue as the sky, emblazoned with a yellow side-stripe. A Stetson hat, leather gauntlets and shin-high boots completed the outfit, offering stark contrast to our predominantly beige attire.

One of the men dismounted his horse and presented our elders with an assortment of beautiful glass beads. The gift signaled that they came in peace, yet I took notice of a long rifle protruding from the saddlebag and a pistol at the man’s hip. The language he spoke was unfamiliar, but my uncle who had traveled far and wide understood and offered to translate.

He explained that the horsemen were building a trading post a few miles downriver and wanted to acquaint themselves with the locals, as we had much needed meat and pelts which could be swapped for their manufactured goods.

The rest I failed to hear, for youthful curiosity overwhelmed me. Emerging from my hiding spot behind my mother’s legs, I approached the man and tugged on his colorful pants. He looked down and smiled, his light eyes friendly and warm. Bending to my level, he reached into his pocket and produced a single silver coin which he offered in the palm of his hand.

“Dollar,” he said.

I took the coin and examined it. One side featured the profile of a stoic looking woman with wavy hair. The other displayed a majestic open-winged eagle.

“Dollar,” I repeated, grinning at my newfound treasure.

The man patted me on the head and shook hands with the elders before mounting his horse. He turned to ride away but swung back around to face me and pointed to his chest.

“George,” he said.

I understood enough to know he was telling me his name.

“Chaska,” I replied.

George nodded in acknowledgement, and together with his horseman rode off into the distance.

A friendship blossomed over the next few months as goods flowed back and forth between our camps. The other boys and I raced to meet the dust cloud that accompanied their weekly visit, eager to see what new curiosities George and his men had come to deliver.

Spring and summer soon faded into fall and their appearances became less frequent. One morning I awoke to a thin layer of white powder dusting the surrounding plains. A premature snowstorm the night before signaled a harsh winter ahead, and urgent preparations were needed to survive the coming cold.

Later that afternoon, preoccupied with chores, I failed to notice a horse approach until spooked by a whinny in my ear. I whirled around to see George chuckling at my reaction. He hopped down from the steed and I playfully tossed a handful of snow, spattering the breast of his overcoat with ice.

George feigned retaliation and I dashed away giggling as the elders came to greet him. Now a safe distance from reprisal, I turned to watch the men speak. George unbuckled a knapsack from his horse and removed a woven scarf. Its color was a perfect match of his trousers, down to the dazzling yellow stripe bisecting the wool. He offered the cloth to my uncle who bowed in reverence at his generosity.

George then stuck his thumb and forefinger into his mouth and emitted a loud whistle. His men led a train of pack mules up to the front and proceeded to unload their baggage, setting down scarf after scarf until a veritable mountain lay at their feet. Our chief approached George to offer an ornately carved pipe, but George shook his head and held up his hand in refusal. The scarves were a gift.

Snowflakes began to sprinkle and George packed to leave. I wanted to say goodbye, but Mother called my name and I knew disobeying would have consequences for my backside. I waved farewell and marched away.

The early storm had indeed been a harbinger of worse to come. A severe blizzard struck later that week, forcing us to seek shelter from the barrage of snow. For three days we huddled in our tents while the wind outside howled like a wounded coyote. Deer and buffalo hides kept our bodies warm, but the soft woolen scarves added insulation around our collars. They were especially useful when wrapped over our mouths and noses, sparing our lungs from the sting of the frigid air.

We emerged to find the landscape buried beneath two feet of powder. The bitter frost had destroyed the crops in the fields, leaving our food supply dangerously short for the coming months.

Out of necessity I found myself thrust into duty as a fisherman. Each day, the other boys and I trekked to the river and cut holes in the ice, using wooden lures and rods to catch trout. Paired with the limited game the men managed to catch, the fish helped keep our bellies full. One crisis had been averted but another soon surfaced.

Later that November I was roused from sleep by my baby sister’s cough. She had been somewhat ill for a few days, but her intense hacks indicated a deteriorating condition. At Mother’s behest I dashed to the medicine man and urged him to come right away. For hours he tended to my sister, chanting and rubbing a red concoction on her forehead, but as the sun rose, one final spasm shook her body and she ceased breathing.   

Word of the tragedy spread swiftly and a steady stream of villagers flowed to our tent to offer condolences. The last to come was the Chief, who carried the infant body away and gently laid it atop a funeral scaffold. There, with her favorite corn husk doll clutched in her tiny hand, my sister would ascend to the afterlife.

Mother caught fever soon after. Even in the dead of winter sweat soaked through her clothes. She grew gaunter by the hour, withering before us like a rose in the desert. When she finally passed, her sunken eyes and hollow cheeks rendered her almost unrecognizable.

I’d have thought she died from melancholy had others not started exhibiting the same symptoms. Illness spread through the camp like wildfire. The old, young, and weak were first to succumb, but nobody was safe from the disease’s invisible talons. Bodies accumulated faster than we could erect scaffolds. The stench of death permeated the air, but still I continued my duty as a fisherman bringing food to the survivors.  

Day after day our numbers dwindled in the face of the pestilence until my uncle was the last remaining mouth to feed. In my naivety, I believed he would recover – up until the moment his wheezing stopped and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. I was now the sole survivor.

I ran to my bedding and buried my face in the rolled-up pelt I used for a pillow. Tears streamed down my cheeks as I lay frightened and alone, unsure of what to do next, when suddenly my fingers brushed across the dollar George had given me.

Of course! If I could find his camp George would surely help. I knew the direction from which he always arrived, but the distance remained a mystery. A long journey’s worth of food and water would need to be prepared.

I wiped my eyes and set off to the river to collect provisions, spending the next four days catching and smoking trout. As the sun set on the final day, I filled a knapsack as heavy as my slight frame could hold before laying down to sleep.  

At dawn, I slung the pack over my shoulder and headed south, gripping the silver dollar tightly in my hand for good luck. For hours I trudged through the snow until I felt I might collapse from exhaustion. I dropped the sack to the ground and plunked down to rest my weary feet. Sleep overwhelmed me, for my next recollection was being jolted awake by a hand on my arm. I sprung to my feet ready to fight the possible danger, but it was George who knelt before me.

I wrapped my arms around his neck and began to bawl, trying to explain through sniffles the atrocity I had witnessed. George nodded in somber understanding. He hoisted me into the saddle of his horse, climbed behind me and took the reins. With a click of his tongue, the animal did a pirouette and ambled past the other men, who, in turn, took off galloping north in the direction from where I’d come.

George and I rode in silence until reaching the palisade walls of a fort. Two armed men patrolling the ramparts greeted us with a friendly wave and opened the gates.

“Home,” George said as we approached a small wooden cabin and dismounted. Inside a steady fire burned in a stone hearth. George directed me to a cot in the corner and removed a kettle from the flames, pouring a steaming cup of coffee which I gladly accepted. He settled into his own cot as I sipped the hot liquid. Slowly, my frozen bones began to thaw and the comforting warmth of safety enveloped my body. Once again, my eyes grew heavy with the throes of sleep.

“George?” I murmured, laying my head on the pillow.

He turned to face me.  

“Thank you.”

No words came, but his lips pursed into a solemn smile before he tipped his hat down over his eyes to rest.

The next few months proved difficult as not everyone at the fort welcomed me with open arms. I noticed the glares George and I received, and how mothers quietly ushered their offspring to the other side of the street when they saw us approaching. George always made me feel safe though, shielding me from harassment as best he could. 

One afternoon I returned from school to find George in full-dress. “Where?” I asked, presuming he was to leave on assignment.

“Just right outside,” he replied, bending to my level. “But listen to me, Chaska. You must stay inside until I return. Stay away from the windows and do not open this door for anyone. Do you understand?”

His tone rang with a stern urgency I’d never heard. Taken aback, I retreated to my bed. George placed his finger to his lips and slipped out the door.

For quite some time I remained still, but my inquisitive nature soon prevailed. I poked my head above the windowsill to see an audience gathered around a man in a fine suit speaking opposite George. The man presented George an item and the two men saluted before shaking hands. Not wanting to expose myself any longer, I ducked back down as the crowd’s applause filled the air.

A few minutes later George entered, removed his hat, and set a tiny wooden box down on the writing table.

I pointed at the object, curious as to what lay inside.

He sighed and motioned me over to have a look. Inside the box sat a silver coin comparable to mine, only larger.

I smiled at George with genuine happiness, for the item seemed quite valuable, but he neglected to share the same veneration. He tousled my hair and casually flipped the box into the clothing trunk at the foot of his bed.

As time went on, I acclimated to my new home. I made friends with the other children and learned to read and write. George raised me like his own and I grew to view him as a father. At eighteen, I joined the regiment, proud to follow in his footsteps and wear the fine uniform.

Not long after, George fell ill. The doctor prescribed rest and laudanum, but George continued the medicine even after the moratorium. His lively spirit faded with each sip of the bottle. I pleaded with him to stop – but the clutches of addiction were no match for reason.      

Before long he assumed a regular position in bed smiling at the ceiling in quiet euphoria. When he did speak it was about his days with the regiment, retelling tales of his moments of glory. I had heard the stories countless times, but still I humored George and listened with rapt attention each time they were retold.

One winter afternoon I entered the cabin to find George, in uniform, reclining on his bed. The remaining contents of his clothing trunk were strewn about the room.

“Reminiscing again?” I said, shaking the snow from my boots and placing them near the door.

“Yes,” he replied, blissfully unaware of the mess.

“I’m not upset, but we’ve talked about this,” I chided, beginning to pick his things off the floor. “Your uniform is always hanging in the closet, not in your trunk.”

George ignored me as I folded socks and shirts. Out of the corner of my eye I caught glimpse of an object halfway underneath the bed. I bent down on my hands and knees and stretched to reel in a small, half-open box. Inside sat George’s medal which I had long since forgotten.

“Wow, look at this,” I said, handing him the open container.

He stared vacantly for a moment before my words registered. “Have I ever told you the story of how I got that?” he asked.

“As a matter of fact… no.” I pulled a chair next to him, excited to hear a new tale. “I’d like to hear it though.”

George took the medal into his hand and set the wooden case on the bed. “This was given to me for an act of service to my country,” he began, his words soft and sluggish. “When we first arrived on this land, a tribe of natives lived a few miles away. We didn’t know if they posed a threat so I ordered a reconnaissance mission to make contact. We brought with us a peace offering of beads and established a friendly relationship which I reported to my superiors back east.”

I smiled and recalled that first day we met. How taken I had been by the men’s uniforms, and now here I was wearing the same regalia.

However,” George continued, “they wanted us to attack and eliminate the natives. Starting an unprovoked war would be a needless waste, so instead I asked for extra scarves in the coming shipment of winter provisions. Just like this.” He tugged on the one wrapped around his neck. “It was going to be a cold winter and I knew the natives would wear them.”

I swelled with pride. That was the George I knew – kind and caring.

“I’ve never told anyone this part,” he said. “Not even my own boy.”

My nose tingled as I fought back tears. It broke my heart when he forgot my face.

“His name is Chaska. I’m sure you’ve seen him around.”

I nodded.

“I became fond of him at the native camp, but the plan all along was for him not to make it. Like the others.”

I furrowed my brow in confusion, but being that George carried on calmly, I assumed I misheard.

“By some miracle he survived and was making his way to our camp when I found him. I still remember the sight – how heartbreaking to see such a small boy so bravely looking for help. I took sympathy and brought him to live with me.”

“Yes, you saved his life,” I said.

“No” George replied,  his voice grim. “I’m the reason he was alone in the first place. They died because of me. It was my idea.”

I scoffed. “Ok, George, time for sleep.” This was certainly the laudanum talking, but such chatter upset me nonetheless.

“It was my idea,” he repeated. “Look in the case. There’s a letter.”

I reached over and eased the box open. Sure enough, tucked into the lid was a note.



*Dear Colonel George McKenzie,*

 

*I want to personally commend you for the eradication of the savages. Your idea to infect the scarves with influenza was a stroke of genius, for it allowed us to obtain our objectives without a single loss of American life. As such, it is my great honor to present you with this Medal of Honor for your service to your country.*

*Yours truly,*

 

*Daniel S. Lamont,*

*Secretary of War*



I looked up at George slowly, my mouth agape with horror. The man I considered a father had slaughtered my family and my people.

“Why?” I finally mustered.

“I…I was just following orders. It was my job.” George turned his gaze to the floor. “I’m ashamed of my actions, but I’ve done my best to repent by raising him.”

I gagged, nauseous at George’s very presence. I stood to flee but he grabbed my arm.

“Tell me kind stranger – do you think I’m evil?” His voice cracked and sorrow filled his eyes, but his touch burned my skin like a hot iron. 

In a flash of rage, I seized the wooden box and bashed it into George’s skull. He wailed and tried to wriggle free, but I pinned his feeble body to the mattress. Again and again I bludgeoned him, undeterred by the warm blood misting across my face. Only when his screams fell silent did my rampage stop. I looked down at George’s mangled face and slumped against the wall.

A soldier, drawn by the commotion, burst through the door upon the grisly scene.

“Halt right there!” he shouted, whipping his gun from its holster.

The command, however, was unnecessary for already I sat frozen, gazing vacantly at George’s uniform, once so revered, now stained an ugly crimson.

 

\*\*\*

I was arrested without altercation, as I do not deny killing George McKenzie. What I do object to is the notion that my actions were criminal. I consider them neither vengeance nor retribution, but rather justice. Who were George and his minions to label us uncivilized? How twisted to rationalize genocide beneath the banner of progress!

But now I must conclude with haste, for I am sentenced to die at daybreak and the sun’s golden head already peeks over the horizon. At any moment the padding of footsteps will approach and I shall be escorted to the gallows. It is there I am doomed to meet my end, afforded the last words upon which I have already decided. As the hangman tightens the noose around my neck, I shall pull the dollar from my pocket and hold it up for the bloodthirsty crowd.

“I agree with you on one point,” I intend to say as I hurl the coin into the throng. No doubt they will tussle and spar for the small piece of shiny metal. “Barbarians have no place amongst men.”

Then the floor will collapse from under me and the mob will cheer the crack of my neck, gleefully watching until my body stops twisting and the rope is still.   ",2,1768014461.0,KeepWriting,1,1.0,False

""You know what's actually attractive? A guy who approaches because he has something genuine to say, not because I'm just another girl he's trying to impress.""

It was my seventeenth cold approach of the week. I had been reading all the pickup material, watching confidence videos, and forcing myself to talk to women in coffee shops, bookstores, and on the street. I thought I was working on self-improvement. In reality, I was treating connections like conquests and women like checkboxes.

This particular approach was at a bookstore. She was browsing the psychology section I wasn't. But I walked up with my rehearsed opener about book recommendations anyway. Her response stopped me cold.

She wasn't cruel about it. She was matter-of-fact, looking directly at me with a slight smile that held no animosity but offered no encouragement either. There was something in her calm delivery that cut through all my prepared lines and techniques.

""I can tell you're nervous,"" she continued when I said nothing. ""And that's actually fine. Nervousness is honest. But the rehearsed confidence isn't working for either of us.""

I should have been mortified. Instead, I felt strangely relieved like someone had finally called out the elephant in the room. My whole approach to meeting women had been built on a fundamental misunderstanding of both confidence and connection.

""Can I ask you something?"" I said, abandoning my script entirely. ""What would have been a better way to start a conversation with you?""

What followed was a twenty-minute talk that changed my entire perspective. She explained that she could always tell the difference between someone approaching with genuine interest versus someone approaching because she fit certain criteria. The former felt like a compliment the latter felt like being reduced to an opportunity.

""If you had noticed what book I was looking at and had an actual thought about it, that would have been real,"" she said. ""Or if you had just admitted you wanted to meet me because something specific caught your attention. Authenticity is magnetic. The techniques you're using are transparent.""

She wasn't telling me not to approach women she was highlighting the difference between connection and collection. Between seeing someone as a person versus seeing them as a challenge.

The next day, I threw out the pickup material and made a new commitment: I would only approach when I had something genuine to say or ask, not just because someone was attractive. I would allow myself to be nervous rather than hiding behind false bravado. And I would measure success by the quality of interactions, not by getting phone numbers.

The results were immediate and profound. I had fewer interactions, but infinitely better ones. I remember approaching a woman at a farmers market because I was genuinely curious about the unusual fruit she was buying. No agenda, just curiosity. We ended up walking around the market together for an hour, and yes, exchanged numbers naturally at the end.

Another time, I complimented a woman on her band t-shirt because I actually loved that band. The conversation flowed into music, then concerts, then our shared experience growing up in the Midwest. There was no technique in sight just authentic connection.

The most important shifthowever, wasn't in how women responded to me. It was in how I felt about myself. The constant anxiety about ""performing"" correctly had been exhausting. Being genuine, even when nervous, felt freeing. I no longer walked away from interactions feeling like I had succeeded or failed I walked away havinsimply experienced a human connection, whatever form it took.

That bookstore woman probably doesn't remember our conversation. She likely has no idea that her straightforward feedback fundamentally changed my approach to not just dating, but all social interactions. But her willingness to be honest rather than just dismissive gave me the wake-up call I needed.

The great irony of cold approaching is that the moment you stop seeing it as a technique to master and start seeing it as humans connecting with humans, that's when the real magic happens. Not in how many numbers you collect, but in how many moments of genuine connection you create even if they last just five minutes in a bookstore with someone you'll never see again.",2,1768014303.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False

It didn't work out that way. Between the time I received the offer and the time I started, the new unit I was hired to join had completely shifted course and it was no longer the fit it was supposed to be. Still, I made it 3 years there and even launched an entirely new service line despite higher-ups throwing roadblocks in my path because the partner I worked for was feuding with other partners. At roughly the 2.5 year mark, the partner I worked for abruptly left the company and within 6 months, I was laid off. 

It's been nearly 16 months of hell. Hundreds upon hundreds of applications. Dozens of coffees with people in my network. God only knows how many emails to more distant contacts. And it's all yielded about 5 interviews.

My resume is impressive. The accomplishments on there are those of an operator, a problem solver at some of the highest levels of both interjurisdictional government with lives on the line, and in corporate consulting. 

In 3 instances, I've been led on for months, meeting with person after person, team after team at a firm, only to be told that they appreciate my time and they're impressed with my background, but they just can't figure out how they would use me within their organization. 

I've been cobbling together little contract engagements here and there to bring in some money, but I've depleted my savings. My credit cards are all but maxed. I cashed out the 401k I had from the job that laid me off a few months ago and it's dwindling fast. I've cut out subscriptions and anything that isn't essential spending. I'm terrified of losing our house at this point. I'm working on getting the doomsday clock dialed-in, but I'm thinking I have 3-5 months to figure something out before I miss a mortgage payment. 

Today, the job I felt like I had the best chance of landing yet informed me that budget constraints and revenue projections had shifted downward and they're no longer going to be filling the position. 

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, go for a run, and assess whether it's time to start looking at ditch digging jobs and put the house up for sale preemptively. This is hardly the market for it, but it's a nice house and you never know.

First time posting here but been reading a while. I could do with some advice and guidance. I picked up a Mazzer Philos (I189D burrs, I like mostly traditional espresso, medium to med dark) about a week ago, an upgrade from a Sette 270. Great unit and feels like a big step up (mostly motivated by the noise from the Sette).

I have had some issues with shot consistency. Every day, I seem to have to grind a notch finer.

I tend to pull 3-4 shots a day. I’ll dial in an average 18gr in, 36gr out 30sec shot – but the next day that shot pulls in 25 seconds. So I go a notch finer again, get a 30 sec shot or maybe two that morning. but then maybe the second shot right after chokes up and runs long (45 seconds+).

I did the factory suggested calibration/zero per Mazzer (bottom it out, dial to 10 and reset zero point) when it first arrived.

Beans roasted approx. 2 weeks prior - Medium roast blend

Context on setup and workflow:

Machine is a Rancilio Silvia with the typical PID controller mod, upgraded shower screen and gaskets, low-profile nut. Using 18gr IMS baskets (not the nanocoated type). None of this changed when I moved to the Philos, just providing context.

Checked OPV pressure using the water flow test and confirmed set at \~9bar.

Using the PID enabled pre-infusion (2 seconds wet, 3 seconds rest, then shot starts)

I understand the burrs come 'pre seasoned' on the Philos. I've put approximately 24oz/680gr of beans through it since arrival. Maybe a little more.

To detail my workflow:

1. Decant 18gr beans into dosing tray (from normcore coffee cellars, I pre-weigh ahead of time as time limited with family duty in AM)
2. RDT – two sprays and a light stir of the beans
3. Into hopper
4. Grinder on
5. Slowly open trapdoor to feed beans steadily into auger/grinder
6. Invert Philos stock dosing cup into portafilter
7. Funnel on portafilter 
8. WDT - few laps right at the bottom of the basket with tight circles, working upward
9. Tap or two on the counter to settle grounds below the top level of the basket

Given that the grinder is the new variable here, **natural first question**: Is this a symptom of a new grinder ‘seasoning’ or bedding/wearing in? Seasoning seems to be a polarizing topic and would love some opinions here.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Why is this? Idk why i never tasted these good flavours of coldbrew even at nicer speciality coffee shops i never enjoyed a coldbrew on its own. Do they all just over extract it?

1q8smse,https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/english/11928072,Korean defense stocks rally on Trump’s call for higher military spending - 매일경제 영문뉴스 펄스(Pulse),"South Korean defense stocks extended their rally on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a sharp increase in U.S. military spending.

Shares of Hanwha Aerospace Co. were trading at 1.17 million won ($804.6) as of 9:17 a.m., up 7.16 percent from the previous session and marking a new 52-week high.

The stock followed a 7.92 percent jump the previous day, when it closed at 1.09 million won.

Other defense names also moved higher.

LIG Nex1 Co. rose 2.45 percent, Hyundai Rotem Co. gained 3.32 percent, and Poongsan Corp. advanced 5.26 percent.

Investor sentiment toward defense stocks improved amid heightened geopolitical tensions and Trump’s comments calling for a larger military budget.

In a post on his social media account on Thursday, Trump said the U.S. defense budget for 2027 “should not be $1trillion” but “rather $1.5 trillion,” citing national interests during what he described as “troubled and dangerous times.”

Trump has recently increased pressure in the Caribbean by deploying substantial U.S. military forces ahead of an operation targeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and those forces remain in place.

He has also openly expressed interest in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and has suggested the use of U.S. forces as one possible option. Trump has further hinted at the possibility of military action against Colombia, which, like Venezuela, is governed by a left-wing administration.

Meanwhile, Korean chipmakers moved lower in early trading, tracking weakness in U.S. semiconductor stocks.

Samsung Electronics Co. shares were trading at 136,500 won as of 9:07 a.m., down 1.66 percent from the previous session after opening at 136,000 won.

SK hynix Inc. was down 1.59 percent at 744,000 won.

Overnight in New York, most major semiconductor stocks fell on profit-taking, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 1.83 percent for a second straight session.

Shares of Hanwha Aerospace finished at 1,214,000 won on Friday, up 11.38 percent from the previous session while LIG Nex1 Co. ended at 542,000 won, Hyundai Rotem at 219,000 won, and Poongsan at 120,900 won. Samsung Electronics closed at 139,000 won and SK hynix at 744,000 won.

It's frustrating how normal activities like hanging out with friends are seen as wrong and something to be ashamed of in JW culture. Especially if the friend is the opposite gender. 

Since I've woken up I've allowed myself to actually reach out to people and hang out with friends I've made after class. Of course I just don't tell my parents what I'm doing but I heard that my dad is getting suspicious that I'm meeting with people when I leave the house.

And so what if I am meeting with people?? Why should I feel guilty for doing innocuous things like getting coffee, or running errands, or playing board games with someone? Why should I feel bad for having platonic male friendships? Why should I feel bad for wanting a social life? 

All those talk on ""good association"" are really an isolation technique. It's not even enough that someone is from the congregation, they have to be a ""good spiritual influence."" And is their spirituality based on how they treat people, their kindness, or their intentions? No. It's all about how much they do for the organization, how well they follow the rules, and how likely it is they'll ""counsel"" you if you step out of line. 

So many Witness kids grow up socially stunted because their social life is so strictly controlled and moralized. It can't be healthy to be constantly categorizing people and relationships as ""good and Godly and wholesome"" and ""bad and Satanic and unwholesome."" I regret all of the friendships with genuinely kind and supportive people that I've cut off in the name of pleasing ""Jehovah.""",6,1768013610.0,exjw,2,0.87,False

It's the digital equivalent of someone stealing your recipe, opening a restaurant across the street, and somehow convincing everyone they invented the dish.

But something interesting is happening. The creators who see where this is headed? They're not rolling over. They're building walls. Digital fortresses. Subscription models so exclusive they make Costco memberships look quaint by comparison.

And the truly fascinating part? We're subscribing. Willingly. Eagerly, even.

**Contact activist Sinéad Whelehan obtained a photo of an “ET” while participating in a CE-5 event. Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person’s world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sinéad Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the **“Beyond Being Human” website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the “Beyond Being Human” webpage Sinéad is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness “as well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.” 

I subscribe to Jeff Mara’s Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program “**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event – ALIEN PHOTO.”** 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small “alien” being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following: 

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small “boxy” non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared. 

**Sinéad ’s Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara’s interview, Sinéad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program. The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sinéad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night. **Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.** Sinéad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sinéad Whelehan:** This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn’t know, who was in the circle. Now you’re seeing the very edge of the meditation circle…. Grant Cameron…  was there with me…. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.….**And there’s a little being right there. And here’s the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well…** 

**A**nd then here’s a really super-duper close-up version of the little being…

**Jeff Mara:** Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sinéad Whelehan:** Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience… I was feeling them to my left … You can see where my body is… and here’s the little being’s shoulder and there’s the neck, it’s head… the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.   
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sinéad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sinéad Whelehan’s personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sinéad’s  journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants. 

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sinéad experienced what she describes as a “massive awakening.” She explained the term “awakening” might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to “being bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan…” It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant. 

Sinéad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sinéad, the beings were saying, “OK. It’s time! We’ve been with you all along. It’s now time. You have a job to do!”   And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with “the extraterrestrials.” This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside. 

For two decades Sinéad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?   
  
**In the following section of this report, Sinéad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.** In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sinéad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.) 

“It’s that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.  I knew what they were telling me was real.  And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.  

An example is that I’m a teacher.  This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my “awakening” in July and about two weeks after the “big cosmic frying pan experience” happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills). 

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,” Oh my God, I have gone crazy.” 

So, I started getting worried about myself.  I went home one day… and I was very upset.  I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I’m not someone who grew up religious… I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, “I need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable….”

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.  Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual… (What) we’re supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there’s this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them… We’re supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.  They are 10-11 years old. They’re in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about “the Day I Became Famous.” It’s a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o’clock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, “the earth is alive”, “the Galaxy is full of other beings” (What) I was reading … has nothing to do with the original prompt “The Day I Became Famous.” Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child’s writing, “there’s a portal in my bedroom”, “I designed time travel”, “I made a time machine”, “the earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we’re all doing to her”. “There are spaceships out there.” I mean I just couldn’t believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, “I have to”… I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to… “I need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?” Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.  

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.  They all wrote me back and said, “Yep this is what happens.” You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) “How I Became Famous” (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th) graders, things like) “because of YouTube.” 

**Discussion:**

**How were** the non-human intelligences that contacted Sinéad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th) graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing “The Day I Became Famous”, they wrote about numerous themes associated with “ET contact.”  

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/“illusory” mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These “thought forms” might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sinéad ’s recollection of this “High Strangeness” be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called “anomalous phenomena”, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sinéad and reassuring her with a reply akin to “Yep this is what happens.”

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science’s explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong. 

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our “reality” at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the “inexplicable” events that we label “High Strangeness.” Sinéad ’s encountering a stack of “anomalous” handwritten 6^(th) grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her “friends in high places.”

**Upon return from a CE-5 mission to the Volcanic Zone where we witnessed a large silent triangular shaped craft, I experienced several High Strangeness events. These included a sighting of a 100-foot UFO over US-10. While carrying out contact protocols with my team in the Santa Monica Mountains, I heard an anomalous sound track through our research site.**

1q8sh21,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiboSuccessStories/comments/1q8sh21/sharing_what_helped_my_ibs_after_an_8year_journey/,Sharing What Helped My IBS After an 8-Year Journey,"A very long message, because I am trying to share as much as I can in hopes it will help someone.

**NOTE:** This is not medical advice. It’s purely my personal experience based on trial and error.

**Key message:** I realized food wasn’t the issue—my digestive system was dysregulated. More details below.

After 8 years of a difficult journey with IBS, I finally found something that is helping me. I am not cured, but I’ve regained some control over my body and can finally manage my symptoms.

Below, I’ll first outline my symptoms and then share my new routine. I recommend trying this routine consistently for at least two weeks before giving up. I began noticing improvements around day 10. I’ve been following it for the past four weeks, and my stomach feels better each day. I expect I’ll need to stay on this routine for some time, until my body can function well without it. For now, I’m supporting my body in ways that a healthy digestive system naturally operates.

Before starting this routine, please do your own research to ensure it’s compatible with your lifestyle, age, environment, and any medications you may be taking.

**My medical journey**

I was diagnosed with IBS eight years ago and switched doctors multiple times due to dismissive attitudes toward my pain (often referred to as mere “discomfort”). I’ve had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, allergy testing, countless blood panels, tried a low-FODMAP diet, acupuncture, and even took SSRIs for a few months for what was described as anxiety-driven IBS (which was a terrible mistake for me). Nothing ever came back “wrong,” yet I felt awful every day.

**My symptoms**

* Symptoms began as soon as digestion was activated, regardless of what I consumed—food or liquid
* Bloating started immediately when I began eating, not later during digestion
* Constant bloating throughout my entire torso, not just my stomach
* Bloating could be painful (pressure under the rib cage, gas cramps) or painless (appearing pregnant, with up to three inches of swelling everywhere)
* Bloating was severe, up to three inches. Pants that I wore before the meal would no longer fit after the meal
* Food felt like it constantly sat in my stomach
* I rarely felt hunger cues; I would go from not hungry to nearly fainting, which was my signal that I hadn’t eaten
* I felt full by the third bite, and my body urgently told me to stop eating
* Bowel movements felt incomplete, coming out in pieces (pellets) or shredded (like wet paper)
* I had no normal urge for bowel movements; I would sit on the toilet for 20–30 minutes waiting. Without sitting, waiting, and straining, it wouldn’t happen
* Shopping and travel were major triggers for painful, gas-related bloating

**What I changed (and why it helped)**

I implemented all of the following practices at once. I strongly believe this routine works best when done holistically, rather than piecing together individual changes.

**Morning**

* I drink warm water first thing in the morning; my digestion needs to wake up gently
* I drink warm water before meals if I already feel bloated (sometimes sipping during meals as well)
* Light movement to start the day (e.g., gentle walking around the apartment, walking the dog)
* 3-6 deep, slow, and intentional breathing (via stomach, not chest)

**Breathing & posture (the biggest shock for me)**

* I stopped crossing my legs while working, sitting, and eating, which reduced compression of my abdomen and pelvic floor. I hadn’t realized how often I did this. After a month, crossing my legs now causes immediate stomach discomfort.
* Instead of fidgeting in my chair, I get up and move. I used to ignore my body’s signals; now, when discomfort starts, I respond immediately. Even minimal movement can help.
* Softening my stomach: I realized I was unconsciously holding my stomach in all day (think of how we pull our stomach in for photos to make our stomach look flatter). It took time to relearn how to let it relax. Remember to not push your stomach out, just gently let go.
* Intentional belly/rib breathing: this relaxes the diaphragm and supports digestion and bowel reflexes. I aim for 3–6 slow breaths in the morning, before meals, or when stressed. I discovered I had been living on shallow breathing, and this practice made a big difference.

**Eating & meals**

* Warm breakfasts, which are easier on digestion than cold foods.
* Eating slowly (about one minute between bites) to allow the stomach and intestines to coordinate properly. This helped me recognize fullness and stop at the right point. It felt awkward at first, but became natural with time.
* Stopping before feeling “too full” to avoid pressure and nervous system overload.
* I eat three meals a day – incredibly important to train the digestion to kick in on time (google this term: cephalic phase of digestion)
* Movement after meals (this was huge): even 1-minute helps, ideally up to a 10-minute gentle walk. If walking isn’t possible, standing and gently swaying your hips for a minute works. This helps food move down instead of getting stuck and causing bloating. Keep movement light and intentional—not intense exercise. I personally got a walking pad for convenience, but you don’t need it. You can tidy the room, walk around the house, walk the dog, etc. Any light movement will do.
* during the first 4 weeks of this routine, i avoided big trigger foods (e.g., rice, potatoes). I started to introduce them slowly during my second week when I felt some stability in my stomach.

**Coffee**

* I stopped drinking coffee first thing in the morning. It triggers my stomach to get into a ""fight of flight"" mode. I start my day first with warm water, eat a warm breakfast, wait 15 mins, and then drink coffee. And I need to drink the coffee slow. I also reduced my coffee intake to one cup a day, because i realized that i was making the ""fullness"" feeling worse for me. Eventually i stopped coffee all together and I feel 100% times better. It was very difficult during the first two weeks (e.g., migraines, fatigue), but I was determined. Week three is when I started to not need it. If you want to try and stop coffee, do so during the weekend so you can adjust to it outside working hours.

**Teas & supplements**

* Ginger tea: supports stomach emptying and gas movement. Best time to drink ginger tea is when you are bloating from fullness without gas (think of it as soft bloating).
* Ginger capsules: an alternative to ginger tea, and especially useful before large meals; tea worked better for me. Do not combine both at the same time.
* Peppermint tea: relaxes intestinal spasms and reduces gas pain. Best time to drink it is when you have gas-trapped bloating (think of it as hard bloating).
* Peppermint capsules: an alternative to peppermint tea; again, do not combine both at the same time.
* I legit carry ginger and peppermint tea bags on my bag now because I never know when I will need it

**Movement**

* Daily walking, especially after meals
* Gentle yoga or stretching (avoid intense core workouts during the first few weeks of this routine, as your digestion needs softness to feel safe)

**Signs this routine was working for me**

* I no longer bloat immediately after eating. If bloating occurs, it happens later during digestion
* Bloating is mostly in my lower abdomen (digestion) rather than throughout my torso (inflammation)
* All bloating resolves overnight; I wake up with a flat stomach
* Normal bowel movement urges returned, and bowel movements became more formed, easier, and more complete
* I can now reduce bloating once it starts. Either through walking/movement, tea, or breathing, I am able to reduce the symptoms
* Gas moves instead of getting trapped
* Hunger cues returned; I am now eating
* My body feels calmer around food
* I’ve begun tolerating foods I couldn’t eat for years (like rice and potatoes), introduced slowly and in small amounts

**Important note:** I still experience bloating, but it no longer feels suffocating. Most importantly, I finally feel in control and have tools that truly help. This routine isn’t meant to be permanent. The goal is to support the body long enough for it to shift out of “fight or flight” and feel safe enough to digest properly. Like any other habit, this may take time too, so don’t get discouraged. I started seeing improvement in about day 10, you may see a difference sooner or later. Bodies are different.

**Here are concepts that I had to get educated on to help me learn what is going on with my body.** Please read up on them as it may give you helpful insights.

·       Cephalic phase of digestion

·       Gastric motility

·       Functional bloating

·       Nervous system state (sympathetic vs. parasympathetic)

·       Diaphragm-Gut connection

·       Chronic abdominal bracing / belly holding

·       Posture and intra-abdominal pressure

·       Pelvic floor-gut connection

·       Loss of interoception (body signals / loss of hunger signals)

I know it's triggered when someone orders an item and it gets removed from the pages on Vine, but I feel like this isn't always happening? I set the NM to run starting a 3am and end at 4pm. I figured I could let it run and catch the drops overnight and then when I'm drinking my morning coffee I could remove all of the unavailable stuff and pick through the rest. When I start looking through after removing the unavailable though there's still tons of items on the page that look like I could order them but when I click on the them it then triggers the item to be unavailable. Is it a refresh thing where I should refresh the Vine page first or go through the pages on Vine first to trigger the NM feed to mark things unavailable and then go back and click the remove button so it only shows actual items I could order? 

I leave it running during the day and have caught some cool things while half paying attention to it so it's doing fine after I start actively interacting with it, it's just before that when it seems to not do what my brain thinks it should based on how it works the rest of the day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

**Contact activist Sinéad Whelehan obtained a photo of an “ET” while participating in a CE-5 event. Her story reveals not only the power of contact to transform a person’s world view but also provides a dramatic example of how UFO intelligences manipulate spacetime.**

**Joseph Burkes MD 2023**

**Introduction**

Sinéad Whelehan is a contact activist that I met in November of 2021 when she produced an online video interview with me for the **“Beyond Being Human” website**. At that time, she had been working with researcher/author Grant Cameron for two years gaining experience as a researcher and interviewer. According to her brief bio on the “Beyond Being Human” webpage Sinéad is a lifelong experiencer of multiple forms of paranormal high strangeness “as well as being a lifelong spiritual practitioner.” 

I subscribe to Jeff Mara’s Podcast and when I saw her picture appear as a guest on his YouTube channel, I wanted to hear what she had to say. My curiosity was piqued when I read the provocative title of the program “**Alien Stands Next To Her AT CE-5 Event – ALIEN PHOTO.”** 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxwHWZZGhA&t=1462s)

The event that she describes in which a small “alien” being is photographed next to her during CE-5 fieldwork reminded me of an encounter that I had with my contact team one night in the Santa Monica Mountains in 1993.

**High Strangeness in Malibu Canyon**  
  
For five years back in the 1990s, I was a contact team leader for the CE-5 Initiative. Our group staged repeated Human Initiated Contact Events (HICE) in Southern California. During one outing the team was operating high up overlooking Malibu Canyon. While in deep meditation, I felt a strong pleasant pressure sensation in the middle of my chest. In retrospect, I imagine that my heart chakra was opening wide, because I was filled with a powerful peaceful loving feeling. After the meditation was over, my teammate, United Airlines Captain Joe Vallejo, told me the following: 

He stated that at one point during the meditation he had slightly opened his eyes. There, standing directly in front of me, was a small “boxy” non-human being. Its rectangular form was only about two feet high, and it stood motionlessly less than twelve inches away from me. He reported that when he opened his eyes wide to get a better look, the rectangular form disappeared. 

**Sinéad ’s Photograph Obtained During Volunteer Contact Work**

During the last 20 minutes of Jeff Mara’s interview, Sinéad showed the photograph mentioned in the title of the program. The digital picture was taken during an Illinois CE-5 nighttime outing in 2021. According to Sinéad, it was light blasted to bring out the details not easily seen because the picture was taken at night. **Aside from the light blasting, no other alterations of the photograph were reportedly made.** Sinéad gives her description of the photograph during the interview as follows:

**Sinéad Whelehan:** This is a random photograph that was taken by a woman I didn’t know, who was in the circle. Now you’re seeing the very edge of the meditation circle…. Grant Cameron…  was there with me…. So, my chair is on the other side of Grant.….**And there’s a little being right there. And here’s the bright light coming out of my chest with these kinds of tendrils of light as well…** 

**A**nd then here’s a really super-duper close-up version of the little being…

**Jeff Mara:** Would you say that that being is standing right next to your chair?

**Sinéad Whelehan:** Yes, yeah and I felt it there, you know, even during that experience… I was feeling them to my left … You can see where my body is… and here’s the little being’s shoulder and there’s the neck, it’s head… the eye.. and there are other beings in the photograph as well.   
  
Understandably because of the photograph that Sinéad presented, there has been considerable public interest in this Jeff Mara podcast. In just a few weeks, over 60,000 views of this interview had been tallied. In my opinion, however, Sinéad Whelehan’s personal story as described in this in-depth interview is of even greater significance than the photographic evidence she obtained. Sinéad’s  journey into contact has involved her overcoming many personal challenges. Perhaps the most important one is the fact that she is nearly totally deaf and has required two major surgeries for cochlear implants. 

**The Making of a Contact Activist**

In July of 2019, Sinéad experienced what she describes as a “massive awakening.” She explained the term “awakening” might not be the best term to use because for decades she previously had engaged in spiritual practices like meditation and yoga. Nonetheless, what happened to her in 2019 was likened to “being bonged on the head with the cosmic frying pan…” It happened as she was recovering from her second cochlear implant. 

Sinéad suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence in her room of multiple non-human entities who communicated with her telepathically. According to Sinéad, the beings were saying, “OK. It’s time! We’ve been with you all along. It’s now time. You have a job to do!”   And her mission was to spread the word that every one of us are cosmic beings. And we need to recognize our long-standing relationship with “the extraterrestrials.” This new sense of duty, however, was not without a downside. 

For two decades Sinéad had a very responsible position as a public-school teacher in Canada. She worked in special education for elementary and high school students. Her profession gave her an opportunity to work with children, something she has always loved doing. In addition, her position provided her with a good income, job security and benefits. She found herself in a dilemma, how could she change her life in ways that were consistent with the radical paradigm shift that she was undergoing?   
  
**In the following section of this report, Sinéad Whelehan reveals one of the most astounding contact events that I have ever come across.** In my judgment, this vignette is an example of how UFO intelligences can manipulate spacetime. Sinéad describes her difficult personal situation and how her request for validation led to an astounding High Strangeness Event. (The following transcript has been edited by me for readability.) 

“It’s that feeling that experiencers often talk about. I just knew that it was ETs.  I knew what they were telling me was real.  And believe me, I had moments of doubting myself. Then, I would ask them for validation, and they would give me ridiculous validation that was absolutely undeniable.  

An example is that I’m a teacher.  This happened in the summer (of 2019). I had my “awakening” in July and about two weeks after the “big cosmic frying pan experience” happened. I had already been hired months before to mark government literacy tests. There are these booklets that are sent out to kids all over the country. In Canada they were sent out to kids in grade 6 to test their math and their literacy (skills). 

So, I was hired to mark these booklets and score them. (This project was) to track the data for kids all over the country in terms of their literacy levels. This job was done in a massive warehouse. And there I was with all these tired teachers, you know, trudging in with big jugs of coffee. They were chugging down their coffee through the day and marking these booklets. It was just such dry work and in this big, huge empty warehouse. And, you know, we got cattle called back after breaks. It felt like such a massive juxtaposition to the vibration that I had experienced (with the ETs) just a short while before that I started to feel like,” Oh my God, I have gone crazy.” 

So, I started getting worried about myself.  I went home one day… and I was very upset.  I just started talking to them (the ETs) out loud. I’m not someone who grew up religious… I never prayed in my life, but I just started talking to them. I was sitting on the floor of my living room crying a little bit, really, really distressed, and stressed out. (I was) wondering if I was mentally well. I asked them, if this (the continuous presence of ET beings in her life) is really true, “I need you to prove it to me. I need you to prove it to me in a way that is undeniable and unmistakable….”

So, then I felt this very warm soothing presence around me, and I relaxed. I felt better and I went to bed.  Woke up the next day, drove to work. It started as usual… (What) we’re supposed to do is just walk up to the front of the room where there’s this massive floor to ceiling shelf. I grab a random stack of booklets, bring them back to our desk and start marking them… We’re supposed to mark exactly the same question over and over again. So, each (student)answers the question differently.  They are 10-11 years old. They’re in grade 6 and supposed to be writing about “the Day I Became Famous.” It’s a creative writing challenge for them.

**Astounding High Strangeness Event**

On that day, for 45 minutes, from 9:00 o’clock until 9:45 every single booklet I opened had compositions about, ET s, UFOs, flying cars, free energy, portals, “the earth is alive”, “the Galaxy is full of other beings” (What) I was reading … has nothing to do with the original prompt “The Day I Became Famous.” Nothing to do with it! Here are these kids writing in pencil in 10- to 11-year-old child’s writing, “there’s a portal in my bedroom”, “I designed time travel”, “I made a time machine”, “the earth is alive and conscious; she knows what we’re all doing to her”. “There are spaceships out there.” I mean I just couldn’t believe it. I could not believe it!

We were not allowed to take breaks that early in the morning, but I just said, “I have to”… I went to the washroom. I texted a bunch of friends of mine who I had met by that point in the community because immediately after my awakening I just started reaching out to people for help. I needed to understand what was going on. I connected with the lovely Kosta Makreas (who was recently interviewed on the Jeff Mara Podcast). Kosta was immediately there for me, to support me. I texted him and a couple of other people he had introduced me to… “I need you to tell me if this is real. Did this really just happen?” Meanwhile the hairs on the skin of my arms are standing straight up.  

(There I am) in a stall in the bathroom furiously typing.  They all wrote me back and said, “Yep this is what happens.” You know, this is exactly it! I mean how can you deny that is validation! Not to mention, when I came back from the bathroom, the rest of the booklets that were on my desk, I think there were three or four left, none of them had anything to do with it (the flying saucer/paranormal themes). It was all back to the question (and for the rest of the day it was the original composition prompt question) “How I Became Famous” (The answers were what one might expect from 6^(th) graders, things like) “because of YouTube.” 

**Discussion:**

**How were** the non-human intelligences that contacted Sinéad able to stage such an extremely strange sequence of events? She asked for a clear sign that her contacts and communications were real and not the result of her being mentally imbalanced. The very next day the compositions written by 6^(th) graders deviated from the assignment. Instead of writing “The Day I Became Famous”, they wrote about numerous themes associated with “ET contact.”  

For two decades I have promoted what I call the Virtual Experience Model for flying saucer investigations. This theory outlines what I believe are consciousness-based/“illusory” mechanisms of contact employed by UFO intelligences during interactions with people targeted for encounters. According to this proposed model, a Virtual Experience of the Third Kind (VE-3) is a false memory inserted into the consciousness of a contact experiencers by flying saucer intelligences. These “thought forms” might be so skillfully done that the false memories convince the experiencer that they represent recollections of actual events. Could Sinéad ’s recollection of this “High Strangeness” be a false memory, a VE-3?

This is not a reasonable explanation because immediately after being confronted with the High Strangeness of children writing about what are called “anomalous phenomena”, she texted fellow contact activist Kosta Makreas. I spoke to him the day after I viewed the interview. Kosta recalled receiving the message from Sinéad and reassuring her with a reply akin to “Yep this is what happens.”

For decades, renowned UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee has pointed out that the intelligences responsible for UFOs appear to be able to manipulate spacetime. In my opinion, a consensus is beginning to emerge among contact experiencers as well as UFO investigators that the High Strangeness events associated with UFOs are showing us that materialist science’s explanations as to the nature of reality are at best incomplete. If consciousness, and not mass/energy is the wellspring of creation, then the fundamental assumptions of academic mainstream science are plainly wrong. 

**Conclusion**

If consciousness is primary, then perhaps our 4-D reality of spacetime is a kind of projection from some more fundamental realm that is pure consciousness. There has been much speculation in scientific circles that the Cosmos, and everything in it, is part of some simulation created by advanced intelligences. If this is true, then the alleged ETs might be able to enter our “reality” at will and alter the simulation, thereby staging the “inexplicable” events that we label “High Strangeness.” Sinéad ’s encountering a stack of “anomalous” handwritten 6^(th) grade compositions could very well be an example of a personal simulation being altered by her “friends in high places.”

**Upon return from a CE-5 mission to the Volcanic Zone where we witnessed a large silent triangular shaped craft, I experienced several High Strangeness events. These included a sighting of a 100-foot UFO over US-10. While carrying out contact protocols with my team in the Santa Monica Mountains, I heard an anomalous sound track through our research site.**

  Scot Lancer heard the foot falls of giants. Under the three moons in the clear night sky, he could see for hundreds of yards in any direction on the open rocky range. The earth still shook underfoot with the ponderous tread of titans. Off to his left side, forty yards away, a big boulder rolled aside loudly to reveal a gargantuan cave cleft.

  Out of it stepped the giants known as saldars. They averaged fifteen to twenty feet tall and were lean and muscular. Their skin was black scales, like snakes. They were humanoid, but their faces were rather reptilian, with flat noses, dark snake eyes, and mouths full of pointed teeth for eating meat. They looked like a humanoid evolved version of reptiles. They wore leather clothing, with chain mail shirts, mail kilts, greaves on their boots, and helms on their heads. They carried massive iron axes, swords, spears, hammers, wood shields, bows and arrows.

  They were emerging from a hidden tunnel the boulder had blocked so effectively that Scot was camping close to it. He'd thought he was able to see any enemies coming from any direction. He'd thought wrong. The giant saldars instantly saw him. They verbally rumbled excitedly in their harsh language. Scot was nothing they feared. He looked like a mouse to the monsters.

  Scot only stood five and a half foot tall. He was lean waisted and possessed a muscle packed, impressive, bodybuilder's physique. He was young and good looking, with blond hair and blue eyes. Numerous scars crisscrossed his face and physique. His left hand was robotics, covered in synthetic skin that soaked up solar energy to power it. That robotic hand pulled out what looked like a foot long flashlight. A yard long, scintillating, sapphire, jet of energy, ignited from the plasma torch. His right hand pulled his scoped plasma pistol, which fired plasma and ion infused, incendiary bolts. He shifted his stance as the saldars poured out of the cave mouth, eager to attack him. They believed they were dealing with a simple human.

  Scot was an Earth man, but his DNA had been altered by the bite of a rare creature called a Slypher. It made Scot's former strength and speed more than triple. He tensed for action, quickly counting over twenty saldars in sight. No words were spoken. None were necessary. Several saldars bent their behemoth bows to aim arrows over eight foot long.

  Scot's pistol barrel blossomed a ruby, refulgent round that crowned a saldar's brow, beneath his helm. The plasma and ionized incendiary bolt maimed and baked its brain. Scot's sights swiveled to a second saldar that raised his shield in time to block his head and body. Scot's barrel bloomed another bolt that smote low, torching the testicles, to bring the titan tumbling down with his dead brethren. He screamed, clutching his boiled balls.

  Scot's supernatural celerity served him well as he deftly darted, evading several stupendous shafts that swished past where he'd just stood. The party of giants charged with shields raised to block them from waist to face and their weapons waving. Scot's blaster screamed, reaming out a beam that lambasted a leg, high in the thigh. It cut the limb out from under him, so the saldar sprawled on the stones. He squealed, clutching his fried thigh, which continued cooking with crisp, sizzling and popping sounds, like bacon on a skillet. His mail had become molten where the beam bored through, like butter under a blowtorch.

  Scot's swinging sights landed on another leg that he lanced with a blast that fractured the femur while flaming the flesh. The tumbling giant tripped up his buddies that trampled him. Scot scrambled at superhuman speed, dodging and shooting, becoming a blur for his foes. He evaded another accurate arrow whizzing his way, along with a battery of blows from weapons that skated on stone instead of him. His barrel flared a fork that strobed as it drove through a shield to charbroil the chest of a saldar and lick his lung like lava.

  Scot sprang above a stamping boot. The plasma torch in his left hand was like a sparkling, sapphire sword that speared and seared through the saldar's ankle, almost entirely amputating it. He swatted aside an iron sword that stabbed at him. Then Scot was running past the lead gauntlet of giants wielding hand weapons. There was numerous archers   

  Scot's swinging sights landed on another leg that he lanced with a blast that fractured the femur while flaming the flesh. The tumbling giant tripped up his buddies that trampled him. Scot scrambled at superhuman speed, dodging and shooting, becoming a blur for his foes. He evaded another accurate arrow whizzing his way, along with a battery of blows from weapons that skated on stone instead of him. His barrel flared a fork that strobed as it drove through a shield to charbroil the chest of a saldar and lick his lung like lava.

  There was numerous archers’ farther back at an angle ahead, aiming at him. He sidestepped a sibilant hissing shaft that nearly skewered him. His plasma pistol puffed another incendiary ray that tapered an archer's torso, liquefying part of the lung. Another arrow came too close as Scot dived aside and it tripped him. He fell and tried to rise and run, but stumbled on a stone, slowing him as he sidestepped another shaft. The gauntlet of giants wielding iron weapons and swinging wood shields swarmed over him.

  Shannon appeared behind the aiming archers. She resembled a brown furred wolf, bigger than a Kodiak brown bear from Earth, but more streamlined, with muscle and no fat. But she clearly wasn't a pure wolf, because her head and mouth were more humongous than a hippo, with titanic teeth that looked like they belonged on a dinosaur. Her paws were long toed, almost like human hands, and tipped with talons she could unsheathe to reach over seven inches long. Shannon was a werebeast, made of a dark matter and dark energy, she had an alien symbiont.

  Shannon's pounce jounced against a saldar's neck, and her gaping maw snapped like an immense trap, with more power than a car compactor. Her maw muscles flexed on his neck and wrecked his mail to rive his spine. The archer gasped as he went limp as a noodle, paralyzed by the bite. He flopped on his face. Shannon instantly released him and jumped from his back to tap the ground before a bound that found another archer. He glimpsed her spring in his peripheral vision and tried to spin and strike her with his bow. Shannon's big paw batted the bow, blocking the blow, as her other paw's claws sawed through his upraised arm. She coiled her hind feet against his chest. Her dark matter talons trenched in his chest, splitting mail as she kicked to rend flesh, gutting the guy. She dove from him as he stumbled, seizing his stomach, where his intestines erupted out.

  An immense arrow slammed her shoulder like a crane's wrecking ball, bowling her over. Her dark matter, alien armored flesh, withstood the wallop, with only some bleeding from the shallow puncture. It hurt though, and her rage fueled her as she arced at the archer in a streak. He drew his dagger with one hand as the other used the bow in a low blow. Shannon nimbly weaved around the bludgeoning bow, and she lunged low, with a leap and claw sweep that flayed his foot through the boot leather and metal. She bolted by, evading the super-sized, daunting dagger that he slashed to scratch on stone, so close it almost spanked her flank.

  Shannon had reached his back and catapulted up on the nape of his neck. Her massive mouth scarfed up his neck and scissored shut, munching and crunching through mail and meat to cleave his spine asunder. A spasmodic arcing elbow rammed her ribs and sent her spinning through space as he fell. A spear almost skewered her like a shish kabob, scraping her side as she dived.  She swerved and swatted the spear aside as he tried a second thrust and cut with the immense iron blade. The spearman had a shield to block his body and head. An axe almost slashed her back from another saldar.

  She leapt and swept a deft cleft of her claws, sundering mail to lacerate the leg and gore the groin of the spearman. Blood flooded the stony ground from an open artery in his lashed leg. He grasped at his tattered testicles, where her claws carved through his codpiece. Shannon ran clear of the giants raining blows and arrows at her.

  Shannon's awesome attack had distracted the giants from Scot. He had time to recover and run. He still had to dance past some stabs, smashes, and slashes that clashed on stone near him as hammers, axes, and swords flailed at his freakishly fast figure. His plasma torch scorched through mail, flesh, and bone of a forearm as the monster missed its sword strike at him. The monster dropped its sword to grasp at its grievous injury. His blaster cast a lance of energy and the photonic flash dashed through a shield, to melt mail and char the heart of the hammer holder.    Then Scot was clear and running for the forest a few hundred yards away.

  Shannon was about fifty feet to his right, also running. They zig zagged to evade arrows zinging off strings to wing by in many near misses. The giants tried to chase them and were startlingly swift on their long legs. They couldn't match Scot and Shannon's alien enhanced speed. The man and wolf reached the trees and plunged deep into the forest. The giants were enraged and continued the search through the trees towering over them. But they had to abandon their plans of vengeance when the forest grew too thick. Scot and Shannon finally stopped fleeing.

  ""You okay? “He asked her.

  Shannon licked the puncture where the projectile had pierced deep enough to draw blood. There was another bloody scratch along her side from an axe's kiss. She nodded a yes at him.

  “You saved me, thanks."" Scot had a cut through his Kevlar shirt that drew blood, raking his ribs. He had some other superficial scrapes bleeding. “They rolled a boulder aside and came out of a hidden cave in the cliff right next to me. I'm sorry. I accidentally picked the worst place to camp. Glad you came back early. Did you have a chance to hunt?""

  Shannon shook her head, no, while looking bummed out.

  ""Yeah, I'm hungry, too. “He sighed grimly. It wasn't a promising first night on the lowlands of Tier after crossing the mountains. They'd both arrived on the primitive world together through a wormhole activated on Earth by an experimental machine in the year 2086. They survived the mountains trek and were now near the vast savanna .full of fearsome foes.

  The world was a science experiment of the alien Greys that often visited Earth in flying saucer starships, which traveled through wormholes. The Greys had populated the primitive planet with massive mammals from Earth's prehistoric age and dinosaurs, along with alien creatures. That created a lot of predators after prey.

  There were humanoid, sentient species of all sorts, most of which were hostile to strangers. They were limited to flintlock guns for firearms and primitive hand weapons. Scot and Shannon were stranded, they were heading towards a society of Caucasian people, where they could be in civilized surroundings, instead of in the wilds, constantly fighting and fleeing from mammal, dinosaur, and humanoid predators after them. Scot's Earth weapons had been a huge help thus far, but he was running low on ammo, and they had thousands of miles to trek among titans that considered them prey. 

 

 

  Above the clearing, Scot glimpsed a glowing, silvery streak, rocket by. The flying figure did an abrupt U turn and zoomed down to float beside Scot. It was a glowing, beautiful, human woman's soul. She had long, blond hair and bright, sky blue eyes, set in a fine face. She had a fantastic figure with a busty bosom, waspish waist, and lean muscled limbs. She was dressed in a silvery pants suit. Her astral energy was translucent, allowing Scot to see through her. Her name was Sharon, and she'd been Scot's partner for years. Before that she was a FBI agent that specialized in serial killers.

  ""What happened?"" Sharon blurted in concern. ""There was a hidden tunnel behind a boulder right next to camp. The boulder rolled aside and a bunch of saldars came out and attacked me. I'm lucky Shannon came back when she did or they would have got me."" Scot answered grimly.      

  “I'm sorry, Scot. I came back quick as I could,"" Sharon apologized.

  ""It's not your fault,"" Scot assured her. “Do a quick fly around the area to check for predators.""   

 

""Be right back, “Sharon zoomed flying away.

 Scot sighed. When he was a 16 year old orphan in a group home, he had his cranium cracked by a baseball bat.  He woke up from surgery able to see and hear earthbound human souls. He could see the tunnel of light that good souls traveled through to the other side. He could also see the dark wormhole to hell, and the demons that came through it to seize evil souls and drag them to hell. He couldn't see into heaven, or purgatory, where souls unworthy of heaven waited to reincarnate as infants on Earth again. Nor did the souls in heaven or purgatory get free passes to visit Earth for kicks often, so there was a lot Scot didn't know about the afterlife.

  After becoming able to see and hear souls that remained on Earth, rather than going through the light tunnel, Scot encountered Sharon, after she'd been murdered by a serial killer. Sharon begged Scot to help save her partner that was abducted by the serial killer. Scot had helped save Sharon's partner and catch the killer. That had been the start of their relationship. From there, Scot and Sharon formed a partnership.

  At the time, Scot had been a teenage runaway living on the ghetto streets of Chicago back in 2016. He looked old enough to gamble and had a fake ID. Sharon helped him cheat at playing cards in gambling casinos by telling him the cards other players had. In exchange, he reported to authorities Intel Sharon gave him about killers, rapists, terrorists, and human traffickers. Scot would only go after alpha predators. Sharon spent her time flying around spying on people, in the process, she constantly discovered killers, rapists, terrorists, human traffickers, and such. She told Scot, and he either passed the Intel on to authorities, or took a hand in the investigation to save kidnapped victims when necessary, or plant evidence of the predator's crimes to get them busted. Along the way, he kept meeting other ghosts of murdered people that remained on Earth, wanting justice against their killers.

  Scot's psychic abilities led him to working with the FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, the military, and some state agencies. He'd been in the Middle East wars on assignments and lost his left hand there from a bomb. During those years, two of the women Scot loved were killed by terrorists and a serial killer. During a CIA/military mission in the early 2020's, Scot and Sharon were both sucked through a wormhole from an experimental wormhole making machine. That wormhole opened to the primitive planet named Tier, because it was a wormhole the alien Greys often used. Scot had spent over a year on the savage planet, fleeing and fighting to survive. When he began building more advanced firearms and explosives, the alien Greys spying on their experimental world, realized he was an Earth man. They didn't want him evolving their planet's denizens with advanced weapons, so they knocked him out and took him home in their starship.    They were the same little, grey skinned, humanoids, with big heads and huge eyes, often described by people claiming to have seen aliens.

  Although he'd only spent about a year on the planet, Tier, over sixty years had passed on Earth, so it was 2086 when he reached Earth again. He then helped the CIA track down aliens on Earth that were like vampires, feeding on human blood and making hybrid, half human vampire creatures of attractive human women. The investigation had finally led to Scot, Sharon, and Shannon, tracking the final vampires to the Brazilian jungle, where they had just finished building a wormhole machine they were using to bring an army of their kind to Earth from their planet, Tier. They'd built the device largely through the skills of another alien species, called Levians. The Levians were helping them. When Scot blew the machine up, it triggered a final wormhole that sucked Shannon, Sharon, and him through. They were trapped on the planet.

  Shannon was actually a beautiful Earth woman, with long brown hair, emerald eyes, short height, and busty figure. She had been a veterinarian and real estate entrepreneur on Earth, before she was attacked by a wolfish creature that was going around killing women. It was another rare alien creature from Tier that came through a wormhole opening. But people on Earth thought it was some kind of werewolf that bullets and buckshot couldn't kill. Since the killings were occurring in her home region, Shannon had some silver bullets reloaded for her pistol. She'd survived the creature's attack, with the help of her boyfriend, and her silver bullets made the creature spontaneously combust. Like the werewolves of legends, it was highly allergic to silver. Both Shannon and her boyfriend, Tod, became werewolf creatures. Tod had been killed by the vampire aliens, which led Shannon to hunting them. Scot had been hunting the same vampire aliens and Sharon discovered Shannon's secret. The hounds on Earth wouldn't track the vampire aliens because their scent was so hot and bitter that it was like sniffing up habanero peppers. Shannon could track them. It led to Scot and her working together hunting the aliens, which led to them being stranded on the planet. During the night, Shannon transformed into the wolfish creature. By day, she was herself.

. Shannon had been bitten by the alien wolf while it was on a killing spree in her country area. People on Earth thought it was a werewolf that bullets and buckshot couldn't kill. Since the killings were occurring in her home region, Shannon had some silver bullets reloaded for her pistol. She'd survived the creature's attack, with the help of her boyfriend, and her silver bullets made the creature spontaneously combust. Like the werewolves of legends, it was highly allergic to silver. Both Shannon and her boyfriend, Tod, became werewolf creatures. Tod had been killed by the vampire aliens, which led Shannon to hunting them.

It led to Scot and her working together hunting the aliens, which led to them being stranded on the planet. During the night, Shannon transformed into the wolfish creature. By day, she was herself. An alien parasite shared her body, comprised of dark matter, dark energy, and other alien things. While in wolf form, she was incredibly strong, fast, with superb senses, and alien armored, flesh and bones, which could withstand great violence and heal swiftly. But she wasn't impervious, just difficult to kill. In human form, she also possessed heightened physical prowess and abilities, just not as well as she did in wolf form. They'd dropped on the planet in the vampire creatures' jungle. They'd narrowly survived the experience, fighting and fleeing from the jungle up into the cold mountains, where the vampires didn't go because they were cold blooded. They couldn't handle the cold temperatures in the mountains or deal with the giant humanoids that considered the mountains their territory. That kept the vampires stuck in their jungle, unable to spread out across the savage planet. They lacked the materials, tools, and knowledge to build their own wormhole machine, especially without the Levians help. Shannon and Scot had made it through the jungle and mountains, largely through Sharon's scouting and warnings of nearby predatory threats from monstrous mammals, daunting dinosaurs, and the many savage, humanoid giants that were the top predators of the mountains. Scot's backpack from Earth had contained ammo, medical kit, and other useful supplies. But both Scot's Slypher enhanced abilities, and Shannon's werewolf parasite, provided them with greatly enhanced healing and immunity to illnesses, which had been the big factor in their survival on the deadly planet.

  But every day was a gamble.

 

 

  After Sharon let him know it was safe, Scot built up a fire. He had an iron axe and sword short with a sharpening stone he'd taken off a dead vampire months ago. He used the axe to chop wood and whittled up skewers for cooking. He had a military survival knife from Earth that he used to carve up steaks and he roasted the ribs over the roiling fire. They gorged themselves. Scot cooked extra meat they could carry on their trek. Once cooked, it would stay good for a couple days. The less they had to stop for hunting, butchering, and cooking, the safer they would be in the Conquistador's territory.

  The raging fire helped to keep most predators away. The smell of campfires in the area warned most predators that the little men with thunder sticks were near. Most predators had a healthy respect for the Conquistador's thunder sticks.

  A bold Megasaurus dinosaur was hungry enough to creep closer. It greatly resembled an Allosaurus, but was a good dozen feet longer. Sharon warned Scot, and both Shannon and he scaled the tree. When the Megasaurus stuck its huge head out, Scot's scope was steady on its skull, ready to release a roiling round. The Megasaurus was old and had grown slow with age from a gimp hind leg, wounded in a fierce fight. Rather than risk coming close to the fire, where the stag lay, it settled for one of the slain juvenile Allosaurus. Its mouth and front talons latched onto it and dragged the dead dinosaur into the brush. It continued dragging the dinosaur until it was about sixty paces away from the clearing before feeding.

  Once Sharon said it was okay, they came down from the tree to continue eating and cooking. Finally they hoisted a bunch of meat in the tree for safekeeping and slept there. At dawn, Shannon went through her transformation. She went into convulsions as the parasite hid from sunlight inside her. She became a very pretty, dark haired, green eyed, busty bosomed, short, Caucasian, little lady. She was nude and had to settle for slipping on one of Scot's homemade shirts, sewn from soft aurochs' fur. It fell to her thighs.

  Scot was stoking the fire back up. He smiled seeing her slight self-consciousness in the scanty garb. During the approximate 6 months they'd known each other, nothing sexual had happened. Shannon had deeply loved her boyfriend, Tod. After Tod was slain by the vampire aliens, she'd gone on a mission of vengeance, and had no romantic desires for anyone, except her lost love. She greatly grieved him, and had continued to do so on Tier. Scot had engaged in sexual affairs with other females over that time. He knew Shannon was grieving, and not done anything stupid, like making any passes at her. In truth, he did find her attractive. They'd seen each other nude many times while bathing and changing. But they'd stayed in the friend’s zone.

  ""Will it be stag or Allosaurus steaks for breakfast?"" Scot inquired.

  ""Stag,"" Shannon looked grumpy, rubbing sleep from her eyes."" Is it safe to wash up?""

  ""It is. Sharon's flying around on patrol. How are your wounds?""

   ""My ankle is stiff,"" she admitted. Scot noticed her ankle was still real red there, where one of the youngsters had gnawed. There were only faint red marks on her neck and face, where she'd endured very deep wounds. Shannon was limping a bit.

 ""You want some painkillers?"" Scot still had some pills in his medic kit.

  ""No. You better save them for something big. I just need more time to recover. I'm gonna wash up."" Scot pointedly turned his back to her, so she could undress and get in the deep stream. They were using soap made out of flowers' sap that grew on the planet. They brushed their teeth with toothbrushes from Earth, and the same sweet smelling flower sap. The strange purple and pink flowers seemed to grow everywhere and the stems and buds were flooded with the good smelling, honey tasting, and sap. They didn't have any coffee or tea, so water was their only beverage.

  ""Breakfast ready,"" Scot called and started eating.

  ""Thanks,"" Shannon joined him by the fire, accepting her share of steaks.

  ""You could wait here while I go get your pack,"" Scot suggested. “It’d give your ankle more time to heal.""

  ""I don't want you without back up,"" Shannon objected.

  ""Sharon will keep watch for me. You'd have trouble running on that ankle anyway. If you hang out in the tree armed, you'd be safe. I'll be back quickly.""

  Shannon briefly considered it, then nodded. “Makes sense. I'll do that.""

  Scot finished eating and washed up in the stream. Then he went with Sharon back towards the camp he'd fled from last night. Sharon flew around, keeping watch for him. He discovered the saldar bodies were gone, along with all their fallen weapons. There was plenty blood left behind. He recovered Shannon's pack, hidden behind a boulder. The pack contained all her clothing and other supplies. It was sewn together, fashioned from a cave bear's fur with a strap that she looped over her shoulder and back. When she was in wolf form, she put the loop over her neck, or had Scot haul it.

  Sharon abruptly flew back. “Bad news, Scot! There's a dozen saldars running this way from the East and they're being chased by about a hundred Conquistadors! Get out of here!""

  ""Okay,"" Scot agreed. He immediately sprinted across the open range, covering a few hundred yards in under ten seconds, with her pack bouncing on his back. Out of curiosity, he waited to watch from behind a tree.

  ""Am I okay here.” He asked Sharon.

  ""Yeah, they're coming soon from over there,"" Sharon pointed. Scot waited, watching.

  Soon thirteen saldars came running from the enormous forest trees nearby. They were carrying huge, leather sacks, containing spoils they'd stolen from some Spaniard settlers after slaying them. They reached the boulder and shoved it over. They piled in and pulled it back in place behind them, effectively disappearing.

  Moments later, over a hundred Conquistadors burst from the brush into view. They were quite an impressive sight. They were riding dark furred beasts that resembled horses, except they had clawed paws instead of hooves, and big mouths full of predatory teeth. They had saddles and bridles on, along with chain mail, and some plate armor protecting parts of them around their heads, necks, chests, and sides. They carried their riders cooperatively. The Conquistadors riders wore iron plate armor cuirasses over their bodies, and chain mail in other places. They had armbraces, greaves, girdles and helms, to protect their limbs and heads. They had short swords sheathed. Many had shields slung on their backs. They carried double barrel flintlock rifles of approximately 50 caliber. Most riders had two rifles each, so they had one in hand and another in their saddle scabbards. They each carried multiple, double barrel, pistols of approximately 44 caliber. They looked like they meant business.

  ""Wow,"" Scot muttered to Sharon. “I forget how tough they look.""

  ""They didn't get this empire by being meek,"" Sharon replied. “They’ve domesticated some wild dogs too for tracking. Check them out,"" she pointed.

  Scot noticed on the far side, some lean Spaniards, not wearing armor, were on foot running with some wild dogs on leashes. The wild dogs were spotted like African wild dogs, but big as ponies. The three canines were eagerly sniffing the ground, following the saldars' spoors right up to the boulder, where they lost the scent. Abruptly the dogs switched directions and started coming Scot's way.

  ""Scot! They're following your scent now!"" Sharon exclaimed."" Get going!""

  ""Damn,"" Scot cursed and took off. The dogs followed his spoor with laser focus, leading the Conquistadors into the forest. Scot fled for camp.

  ""We got to run, Shannon!"" Scot spat as he rushed into camp. “We’ve got over a hundred Conquistadors coming with tracking dogs! Let's go!"" He threw her pack to her and retrieved his backpack from the treetop.

  Shannon didn't ask questions. She pulled out her pants, socks, and boots from Earth. She dressed in a flash, and added her bandolier with shoulder holster, which held her 9mm machine pistol. She had a belt that held another 9mm semi auto pistol. She carried the short sword slung over her back and Scot's knife on her hip. Scot had the cooked meat wrapped up already, and they'd filled their water skins and canteen. They didn't bother trying to douse the fire or clean the scene. It was too late to hide their presence. Quite quickly, they were rushing away with Scot, following Sharon.

  Shannon was still limping, so they couldn't move anywhere near as fast as they normally did. Behind them, a hunting horn mournfully bawled out. The horn was answered by another horn ahead of them.

  ""Sharon!"" Scot barked. ""I'll check!"" Sharon zoomed away disappearing.

  ""Scot?"" Shannon asked.

  ""Sharon's checking! But it sounds like more Conquistadors ahead!"" Scot spat back. They kept going.

  Sharon returned."" Bad news, Scot! There's over fifty Conquistadors ahead, where the forest ends and savanna starts. They're ready to shoot whatever runs out of the woods. You've got to make a stand in the woods, where you have some cover. Just keep moving for now. Well find a spot.""

  Scot cursed. The wily hunting Conquistadors behind them were intending to flush their prey from the forest out into the guns of their brethren, waiting on the open savanna. It was a bad position they were in. The forest was only a few miles wide at its thickest spots and ended on either open savanna ahead, or rocky open range behind them. Scot felt both stupid and desperate. He stopped abruptly, and Shannon almost bumped into him.

  ""Shannon, we've got over a hundred Conquistadors behind us with tracking dogs. There's over fifty ahead of us, ready to shoot when we reach the savanna. We've got nowhere to go. We can't hide in the trees, because the dogs will lead them to us. If we break out of the forest to try outrunning them on the savanna, they're gonna be shooting at us in the open. Their monster horses are fast with good stamina. I don't see you doing too well on that ankle. I think we need to find a spot to make a stand in the woods, where we have cover. What do you think?""

  Shannon wasn't even breathing heavy from the run. ""So if we try to outrun them on the savanna, they're gonna have open shots at us?""

  ""Yep, and there's no other bigger woods nearby for us to flee to. It's open savanna for the next couple days travel. We're fast, but I doubt we can outrun all those guns. Especially with your ankle.""

  Shannon nodded grimly."" Then we'll have to ambush them in the trees and try doing enough damage to run them off. Do you have a place in mind?""

  ""Sharon's looking."" The baying dogs behind them were coming closer.

  ""We should keep moving, shouldn't we?"" Shannon wondered.

  ""Yeah, let's go,"" Scot moved on at a slower pace.

  Sharon rejoined them. “I found a decent place ahead. They'll have to cross the clearing and you can ambush them from some well sheltered spots. Follow me."" Scot followed Sharon's ghostly glowing, floating figure.

Article

A holy trinity of misery is smashing Victorians who say huge taxes, stupid rules and rampant crime are behind a mass exodus out of the state.

Billionaire property developers are walking away from generational, cityscape-altering projects.

Major manufacturers are seeing their taxes increase by 1200 per cent, forcing ownership to consider what was once unthinkable — closing the doors of decades-old family businesses.

A supermarket chain besieged by machete-carrying teenagers is facing the very real prospect of turning its back on Victorian stores because staff are fearing for their lives.

Small businesses are suffering, too, including cafe owners who are shutting down the long-held aspiration to work for themselves because violent thugs make pouring coffees a day-to-day risk.

It’s a grim snapshot of what it’s like doing business in Australia’s second largest economy as rampant and rising taxes, red tape and unrelenting crime form a holy trinity of misery for those trying to succeed.

Research published earlier this year appears to confirm a problem that is widespread — analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows more businesses fleeing Victoria than any other state.

Between 2022 and 2024, 3085 businesses left Victoria for elsewhere. Comparatively, Queensland welcomed 4276 new businesses over the same period.

The Victorian Government calls the statistics “cherry picked analysis from a Liberal Party-aligned think tank” and says it is “slashing red tape for businesseses”.

But the head of the Business Council of Australia has a different take. He shared a blunt assessment for what’s going on in Victoria, saying the state is sending a clear sign to the rest of the country: “Wrong way - Go back”.

""If the state that built Australia’s manufacturing heart is to turn things around, it must start by addressing uncompetitive business taxes and onerous licensing and regulatory requirements that send a clear ‘Wrong way – Go back’ sign to anyone with capital to invest,” said Business Council chief executive Bran Black.

On taxes, he said “Victoria is officially the most punitive state in Australia”.

“Whether its onerous taxes, or too much red tape, I often hear from my members that Victoria has become an increasingly harder place to do business and invest,” he told news.com.au.

“Australia’s second largest economy matters — we need Victoria to be a success.”

Right now, it is not. None of this is news to business owners, of course.

'Thank God we don’t live or work in Victoria’

“It’s a comedy, but the joke is killing us,” says Angie Romas, the boss of a company that has been involved in major building projects from Docklands Stadium to Southern Cross Station.

From his factory in Dandenong South, 41km southeast of the Melbourne CBD, Angie has watched his sandblasting, steelwork and painting business suffer through year after year of what he calls “the government stealing from Victorians”.

His land tax bill for the 17-hectare site has skyrocketed under successive Labor governments in Victoria from $8703 in 2015 to $203,600 in 2025.

""This is not a government. This is a rabble taking our money,” he told news.com.au.

“I won’t be hanging around (the next few years) to pay half a million dollars in land tax to a government because I’m working hard. Why should we give that much for nothing? We’ve gotta get out in the next 12 to 18 months.”

Angie, 60, has been collecting complainants and consulting with lawyers about a class action lawsuit against the State Revenue Office.

“If I could get a lawyer to submit a complaint against the state revenue office. I just want it to be heard by a judge who says there’s something wrong here,” he said.

In the meantime, he hears from business owners interstate. They all tell him the same thing: “They say to me, ‘Thank God we don’t live or work in Victoria’.

“We are always told that the harder you work, the more money you make. Well, not in this state.”

Developer bails due to ‘level of risk’ in Victoria

Since the 70s, billionaire Salvatore Tarascio has delivered projects all over Melbourne, including the city’s flagship IKEA store and a campus-style office precinct catering to 2250 employees.

But the developer behind Salta Properties who moved from Italy to Australia aged five has noticed a change in recent times.

His son and managing director Sam Tarascio describes it as “uncompetitive settings” in Victoria that are making it more and more difficult to do business there.

In the last year, the company sold off two pieces of prime real estate including the iconic Preston Market and 63 Exhibition Street in the Melbourne CBD.

Planning delays were behind the sale of the market — an important part of the northern suburbs visited by 80,000 people a week.

Plans for a luxury residential tower at 63 Exhibition Street were abandoned out of fear that prospective buyers would be deterred from investing in Victoria by unpredictable and increasing taxes.

A spokesperson for Salta told news.com.au the company’s position had not changed in the nine months since declaring its decision to sell was “significantly influenced by the heightened risk that exists for developers in Victoria as a result of the state government’s increased taxes, charges and levies that have been imposed on the sector”.

""It has been a regrettable decision to divest this prime asset, but we have had to take a pragmatic approach to the level of risk we are prepared to take in Victoria,” Sam Tarascio said at the time.

“In Victoria, we are focusing our attention on parts of the market where government policy is supportive... We call on the Victorian government to work more collaboratively with the property sector and re-evaluate the significant increases to taxes, fees and charges to give the sector a chance to restabilise.

“This is critical to... stop the flow of capital out of Victoria to more supportive jurisdictions.”

'We are paying a debt we didn’t contribute to’

In Melbourne’s southeast, where Mr Romas is toiling away despite hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax bills each year, others are growing equally dismayed.

Land tax, payroll tax, GST, company income tax — it goes on and on.

A survey of businesses in the region found that 100 per cent of respondents are facing extreme increases in land tax from last year.

""South East Melbourne Manufacturers Alliance CEO Honi Walker said they are “being penalised for running profitable businesses — businesses that are the engine room of our state’s economy”.

We are being asked to cover a debt that we did not contribute to,” she said.

That debt Ms Walker speaks of ballooned to $167 billion this year and is predicted to reach $194 billion in the next three years.

So dire are the state’s finances that Treasurer Jaclyn Symes will travel to New York in May next year to meet with ratings agences to personally lobby for them not to downgrade the state’s credit rating.

Businesses see the land tax increases as part of a ploy to bail out the government as debt climbs at a rate of $48 million a day.

Manufacturers are being forced to “absorb Victoria’s debt burden”, Ms Walker says.

The Business Council’s Bran Black says other taxes are just as burdensome, specifically Victoria’s payroll tax.

“Payroll tax is one of the most perverse and damaging taxes in our nation,” he said.

“It literally punishes business owners when they hire more people. On payroll tax, Victoria is officially the most punitive state in Australia.

“Big employers face a top payroll tax rate of 6.85 per cent after including surcharges – with only the ACT imposing a higher rate. And payroll tax kicks in once payrolls hit just $1 million, the equal lowest threshold in the country.

“Every new hire for a growing business costs more, and that shows in the jobs data: for 17 of the past 18 months, Victoria has recorded the highest unemployment rate in the nation.

“The link between a hiring tax and fewer hires isn’t hard to grasp. A manufacturer or builder expanding in Adelaide can pay tens of thousands less in payroll tax than if they were operating in Melbourne.”

Red tape and crime add to business woes as state stagnates

Mr Black says that a cafe owner in Melbourne “must deal with two thirds more licensing requirements to pour a cup of coffee compared to a cafe owner in Darwin”.

“That’s unnecessary red tape that deters investment and business growth,” he said.

Cafe owners are also dealing with a staggering increase in crime on their premises.

News.com.au recently spoke with Moustafa Saoud, the owner of Eleven: 11 cafe in Buckley Street, Footscray.

He revealed he was giving up on his dream after a brutal and unprovoked attack captured on CCTV.

It showed a hooded man walk through the front doors, approach Mr Saoud behind the counter and throw a punch directly at his mouth.

In the vision, Mr Saoud scrambles for safety but the assault continues. When his attacker is done, he calmly walks back out the front door.

Mr Saoud told news.com.au that the most chilling part of the attack was that not a single word was uttered.

""He didn’t say anything. Even when he left he didn’t say anything.”

He’s not the only one facing frightening incidents where diners usually go for a relaxing cup of coffee.

CCTV footage from a Moonee Ponds cafe in July showed a man threatening patrons with a knife.

The incident in the doorway of the Lil Kitch cafe showed a 37-year-old holding a knife outside the door of the cafe before punching the glass a number of times.

He was detained in a citizens’ arrest after multiple bystanders intervened to diffuse the situation before it escalated.

Supermarket chain Ritchies faces similar incidents almost daily trying to run a business in a state where violent youths think they’re untouchable.

Speaking to media in September, Ritchies IGA chief executive Fred Harrison said crime had reached a “crisis point” where “you’ve got to question when leases come up (whether you) want to remain in this area.”

Ritchies has 85 stores in Australia, including 52 in Victoria, but Mr Harrison says no other state faces the same tests Victoria does.

“I’d say 95 per cent of the issues that we are having today as a business are all in Victoria,” he said.

Master Grocers Australia board member Lincoln Meyer says somebody will be killed in Victoria if the government doesn’t do more to make running a business safer.

“There’s an escalation of violent crime, increased shoplifting, assaults within our businesses,” he told the Today Show recently.

“Shoplifting is the big one — when they do get caught, they become aggressive and abuse staff members and it’s not good enough. People just lose their minds.

“We just need some help out there. Our team members are being abused on a daily basis. Every day we hear a story of somebody being assaulted or abused.


""We were the heroes in Covid, standing up and coming to work every day. And now people abuse us and we’ve got no backing from the government.

Victoria’s new Opposition Leader Jess Wilson pounced earlier this month on new figures from the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that showed more than 92 per cent of employers reported growing concerns for staff safety.

Among key findings of a survery of more than 1400 businesses in Victoria, 35 per cent reported facing incidents weekly and 15 per cent said it happened every single day.

“Small businesses are feeling the impact of (Premier) Jacinta Allan’s crime crisis every single day,” she told media.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1q8s8xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q8s8xj/the_second_rhythm/,The Second Rhythm,"I leave the flat before I decide to. The stairwell is that tired grey that does not belong to night or morning. The bulb above the notice board flickers and steadies, like it is negotiating with itself. The papers pinned there have curled into stiff little waves. Someone has written something in black marker at the bottom of one. A phone number, maybe. Or a warning. I do not lean close enough to check. I tell myself I will read them tomorrow. That is what I always tell myself. The air smells of damp stone and detergent that never quite covers anything up. My footsteps make a hollow sound on the stairs. I count them without meaning to. I lose count halfway down because I am already listening for the other thing. The front door sticks in its frame. It always has, but some mornings it feels like it sticks on purpose. I put my palm against the wood, lean my shoulder in, and the door gives way with a reluctant scrape. Too much force and it slams. Too little and it stays shut. Today I get it wrong and the door swings wider than I meant it to. It bangs against the wall, a sharp crack in the quiet, and my chest tightens like I have done something unforgivable. The lock clicks behind me. Then the pause. Not silence. A pause like a held breath, like the building itself is waiting for a second set of footsteps to come through. I feel it settle at the base of my skull. Outside, the street is wet without rain. Not fresh wet. Not clean. The sort of damp that has been sitting there for days, soaking into stone until stone looks softened around the edges. The buildings lean inward, old tenements and soot darkened sandstone, windows stacked like tired eyes. Above them, a thin ribbon of sky the colour of unwashed wool. I walk down the centre of the paving stones because the edges are broken and the sound of my shoes changes too much there. The centre is more predictable. Four steps. Then the hollow dip near the drain. After that, the sound that does not belong. It is always a fraction behind me. Not close enough to brush my coat. Not far enough to ignore. It has the same rhythm as my own footsteps but not the same weight. Like someone trying to match me without wanting me to know they are trying. I do not turn around. I have turned around before. Once, early on, when it was still possible to pretend it was just an echo. I turned so quickly my neck cracked and for a second I saw only the street bending away behind me and a smear of fog. No one there. Of course. The kind of nothing that feels worse than a person would. It made me angry in a way I did not recognise. Angry at the street for being empty. Angry at myself for expecting anything else. Now I do not turn around. The first close is narrow and dark, a slit between buildings, wet walls closing in. The smell is always the same. Wet stone and old smoke and something metallic, like a coin held too long in a warm hand. Posters cling to the walls where the glue has failed. Their colours have bled together. Blues into greys, reds into rust. Someone has torn half of one away, leaving a pale rectangle that looks too clean, like a missing tooth. Halfway down there is a shop window. It is always fogged from the inside, even when the air outside is cold enough to sting. The display never changes. The same dusty books, the same dead fern, the same small lamp with a shade that leans to one side. I stop there every morning. I do not know why. I wipe a circle clear with my sleeve. The glass squeaks softly. For a moment I see the street behind me, bending out of sight. The curve is familiar. It always looks like it is trying to hide something around the corner. I see my own face in the cleared patch. Not fully. Just a suggestion. Eyes that look like they have been rubbed too often. Skin that has gone flat. Like paper that has been handled too many times. I stare for a second longer than I should. Then the fog creeps back, slow and deliberate, sealing the circle as neatly as if I never touched it. I move again because standing still makes the second rhythm louder. At the theatre stairs the temperature drops. The stone steps always feel colder here, as if they have been storing the night for later. There is a smell of old velvet and dust near the door, and sometimes, if I stop, I can hear something inside. Not music. Just the building settling. A faint groan, like a body turning in sleep. My shoes sound sharper on the steps. The other sound does not change at all. I slow until my steps barely qualify as movement. It slows with me. I stop for half a breath. It waits. I speed up without warning, just to feel it adjust. It adjusts immediately. No stumble. No lag. It follows without effort, like it has been rehearsing my body longer than I have. That is what makes me want to run. Not fear. Something closer to disgust. Like a hand on the back of my neck that has been there so long I forgot it was not mine. The bridge is always worse. Wind hits me as soon as I step out of the shelter of the buildings. It flattens my coat against my ribs. It pushes at my face. The fog erases the river below so completely that the lamps on the far side look like they are floating in nothing, unanchored, suspended. The railing is wet. Cold enough to numb my fingers. I grip it anyway. The edges of things feel unreliable here. The pavement. The line where the bridge meets the street. The point where the air turns into fog. Even my own balance feels like something borrowed. I breathe in, hold it, let it out slowly. The breath that follows is too close to be mistaken. I do not look behind me. I do not want to see emptiness again. I do not want to see someone. I used to send messages while crossing. Small, pointless things. Weather jokes. Complaints about the cold. A photo of fog swallowing the streetlamp, captioned Look at this. The replies used to come back quickly. A laughing emoji. A complaint of their own. A question. Then the replies slowed. Then they stopped. I tell myself everyone is busy. I tell myself my phone is old. I tell myself the signal here is bad. I tell myself a lot of things. Then I stop telling myself anything at all. Now I hold the phone in my palm like a weight, screen dark. I wait for it to buzz on its own, as if it might remember I exist. The underground passage sits at the end of a short side street, a mouth in the stone with a metal gate that never fully closes. I duck inside. The smell hits immediately. Rust and old water and damp concrete. The ceiling is low enough that I can feel it pressing down even when I am not touching it. A steady drip keeps time with something I cannot see. I count tiles. One, two, three. The numbers feel safe for a moment. Then my mind slips sideways and the count turns into something else. A list of things I have not done. A list of people I have not spoken to. A list of mornings I have repeated until they have all blurred together. I lose track. I start again. I lose track again. The bend halfway down is darker than the rest. The light stops reaching it, or the darkness eats the light, I cannot tell which. I never look into it. I keep my eyes on the tiles, on the wall, on anything that does not suggest depth. Behind me, the second rhythm follows. Always the same distance. When I come out the other side, the air feels thinner for a second. Then the city closes around me again. I do not go to work. I used to. I had a place I went to. A desk. A screen. A chair that belonged to me. A routine that made sense because other people did it too. Now my days have the shape of something abandoned. I do not explain this to anyone because there is no one to explain it to. I do not even explain it to myself. The explanation would require details, and details feel slippery now. I walk until my legs feel heavy, then I walk a bit more, because the moment I stop, the second rhythm feels closer. Not physically. Something else. Like pressure increasing in a sealed room. Back in the flat, the curtains are closed. I am certain I left them open. I stand in the doorway, keys in my hand, staring at the darkened window like it is accusing me. The room smells of stale air and cold tea. There is a pile of mail on the table. Envelopes with my name printed on them in clean type. I recognise the shape of my name, but it does not feel like mine. It looks like something assigned. I sit on the edge of the bed and listen to the building breathe around me. Pipes click. Someone upstairs runs water. Someone laughs, briefly, and then the sound stops as if it was cut off. These noises prove the world still functions. What I cannot hear is anything that feels directed at me. I check the phone out of habit. No new messages. The screen lights up my hand. Pale light on skin. I stare at it too long and the light begins to feel hostile. I set the phone down face down, as if it might watch me. Sometimes, when I sit very still, I can hear the second rhythm in the flat too. Not footsteps. Something softer. A presence that has learned the layout of my room. The way the floorboards creak near the door. The way the radiator ticks. The way my own breathing changes when I try to pretend I cannot hear it. Sometimes it disappears. Those are the worst moments. The absence is not relief. It is a different kind of panic. A hollow opening under my ribs. A question with no answer. I sit very still, hands on my knees, waiting for it to come back, embarrassed by how quickly the emptiness becomes unbearable. Days blur into stretches without shape. I sleep at odd times. I wake up with my mouth dry and the taste of something sour behind my teeth. I stand at the sink and stare at the dishes and feel nothing. Not disgust. Not motivation. Just the fact of them. A stack of plates that might belong to someone else. Some days I eat standing up. Some days I forget. The hunger comes later, sharp and sudden, and I eat whatever is closest, not because I want it but because my hands keep moving. My body still obeys certain rules. It is stubborn that way. The city changes too, or maybe my perception changes, and the difference becomes impossible to tell. Streets narrow into corridors. Corridors fold into stairwells. I find myself choosing the lower routes without thinking about it. Basements. Underpasses. Closes that smell like wet clothes. The sound cannot scatter down there. It stays contained. So do I. People become an idea. The shops open. The trams run. I see the lights, the movement, but it is like watching through a pane of glass. The faces pass without detail. I cannot remember any of them later. Sometimes someone brushes my shoulder and I do not react until a second afterward, like the sensation has to travel a longer distance to reach me. When I do notice people, it is usually because I envy how ordinary they look. How their bodies take up space without apologising. Fog presses closer each week. Light smears across stone as if someone has tried to wipe it away. Doors no longer shut properly. They rock in their frames when I pass, opening just enough to show a wedge of darkness behind them. I catch myself staring into that darkness like it might contain instructions. One evening the fog is so dense I walk into it as though it were a wall. It does not stop me physically, but it stops something in my brain. The bridge disappears. The stairs disappear. The end of the street disappears. I stand there in the middle of the pavement, heart thudding, and for a moment I cannot remember which direction leads back to my flat. Behind me, the second rhythm stops too. It waits. I choose a direction at random and begin walking. The rhythm follows. Patient. Another night I hear my name hidden inside my own breathing. It is not a voice. Not a sound from outside. It is more like my breath takes on the shape of the word. A syllable in the exhale. I stop and hold my breath, waiting to see if it happens again. It does not. The silence that follows feels like it is laughing at me. I begin to avoid mirrors. Not deliberately. It just happens. Reflections are everywhere in a city like this. Wet pavement. Café windows. Black glass. Puddles. I look past them all. Once, in the window of a closed shop, I catch my outline and do not recognise the angle of my shoulders. My head looks slightly too forward, like I am always listening. My posture looks like someone expecting a blow. The fog closes the surface before I can decide if it was really me. My thoughts fragment into smaller pieces. I notice. I hear. I stop. I start walking again. There are days when I can almost pretend the second rhythm is a person. A stranger with bad intentions. A stalker. Something external. Something I could call the police about. Something I could point to and say, This is why I am like this. But it never does anything a person would do. It never speaks. It never rushes. It never reaches out. It follows with the calm certainty of gravity. I try changing my routes. I try staying in bright places. I try sitting in a café again once, ordering a coffee I cannot taste. I sit at the table and stare at the foam until it collapses into brown. The chatter around me sounds like it belongs to a different species. The second rhythm does not appear in the café. Not as footsteps, anyway. But when I lift the cup, my hand shakes. When I set it down, the saucer clinks. And in the pause between those sounds, I still feel it. Not behind me now. Inside the space my body occupies. I leave without finishing the coffee. I keep walking. The city is all layers. Streets on streets. Stairs that lead to bridges that lead to closes that drop into underpasses. Sometimes I end up somewhere high, where the wind is stronger and the fog looks thinner, and for a moment I can see more of the city than I usually let myself see. Rooflines. Chimneys. A spire cutting into the sky. The bones of the place. Even then, it feels like I am looking at a model rather than a home. Tonight the air is colder than it has been in weeks. The fog hangs lower, heavy as cloth. The streetlamps glow in soft halos. My breath is visible. Each exhale a small ghost that vanishes immediately. I walk toward the river without telling myself I am doing that. I just find myself there. The familiar bridge. The familiar wind. The familiar sensation that the world has edges here, and that the edges are close. The railing is wet. My hands stick to it slightly, skin against metal. The river is a dark suggestion below, mostly erased by fog, but I can hear it. A low, constant movement. Not waves. Not exactly. Just the sound of something continuing whether I am watching or not. The second rhythm is behind me. Of course it is. I lean forward a little, not enough to lose balance. Just enough to feel the pull in my stomach. There is a thought that arrives so calmly it scares me. Not a dramatic thought. Not a sudden urge. Something quieter. If I let go, this would stop. Not the river. Not the city. Not time. Just the constant pressure. The second rhythm. The endless effort of moving through damp air and stone corridors and waking up inside the same grey. My fingers tighten on the railing until my knuckles ache. I do not move. I imagine stepping away from myself. I imagine the absence like a blank page. Clean. Quiet. No footsteps. No waiting. No pauses after locks click. No fog sealing over reflections. No counting. No starting again. The thought is not violent. It is almost gentle. That is what frightens me most. Behind me, the second rhythm stops. I can feel it standing there, as if it has leaned in too. I close my eyes. The wind presses into my face. My eyelashes wet. My breath comes in shallow, clipped pulls, like I am trying not to exist too loudly. The metal under my hands feels colder. It is pulling heat out of me with quiet efficiency. And then, in the middle of that, something changes. Not outside. Inside my chest. A small, ridiculous detail surfaces, uninvited. The notice board in the stairwell. The curled papers. The marker scrawl. The way the bulb flickers like it cannot commit. The way the front door sticks and how I have learned exactly how much force it needs. For some reason, I think about how tomorrow morning, if I am there, I will know how to open that door again. It is not hope. It is not a grand revelation. It is just the fact of a habit. A thread. Something still connected. My grip loosens slightly. I take one fuller breath. My lungs complain, then accept it. I open my eyes and look down at the fog and the sound of the river and the soft blur of lamplight on wet stone. I step back from the railing. Just one step. The second rhythm steps back too. I stand there, heart hammering, and I feel ridiculous and exhausted. I wait for the thought to return. It hovers at the edge of my mind, but it does not land again. Not yet. I turn around. There is nothing new. Stone. Shadow. Damp air. But when I breathe, the space behind me moves in perfect time with my chest, so close that I cannot tell where I end and it begins. The realisation does not arrive like a sentence. It arrives like weight. It has never been behind me in the way I pretended. It has been with me. In me. Around me. Wearing my rhythm like a coat. I stand there for a long time, hands hanging loose at my sides, staring into the fog as if it might explain itself. The bridge creaks softly under my feet. Somewhere in the distance a tram bell rings once. Then again, further away. I take another step away from the edge. The second rhythm follows. Patient. Familiar. I start walking. For the first few metres, my footsteps sound loud and alone on the stone. Then the other rhythm returns, not as an echo exactly, not as a person, but as a pressure that slots into place behind my ribs like it has always been there. I do not run. I do not fight it. I just keep moving, because the act of moving is still something I can do. Halfway across the bridge I pull my phone from my pocket. The screen is cold against my thumb. I do not open any messages. There are none. I do not call anyone. I could. I do not. I unlock it anyway. The light fills my palm. I stare at the blankness for a second, then turn it off again. Still, the fact that I touched it feels like something. A small signal. When I reach the far side of the bridge, the wind eases. The tenements close in again. The city becomes narrower. The fog thickens. The route home is the same as always. The stairwell near the river waits. The bulb hums. The notice board papers curl. The door will stick. There will be a pause after the lock clicks. And I will be there to feel it.",2,1768012680.0,Odd_directions,1,0.76,False

I will be plugging it in and charging the battery before I leave, and most likely leaving the panels at home. This will be used for 1 night only while I'm driving across country and sleeping in my trucks camper shell.

""Finnian, I swear to f—"" The curse barely left Julian Blackwood's mouth before a long, elegant hand sealed it shut.  
  
Finnian Grey leaned in, lips brushing the side of Julian's neck. His voice was low, intimate, right against Julian's ear.  
  
""Hey,"" he said softly. ""Easy there, sweetheart. You've got a filthy mouth when you're worked up.""  
  
The bedroom doors and windows stood wide open. Thin curtains stirred lazily in the night breeze, drifting back and forth, restless and slow.  
  
Julian lay sprawled across the bed, every joint loose, boneless. He didn't even try to move.  
  
His gaze dragged over the red scratch marks streaking across Finnian's bare back as he forced out, voice rough, ""Take the money. Get the hell out. And don't ever show your face in front of me again.""  
  
Finnian sat down at the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette, like he hadn't heard a word.  
  
His tone, when he spoke, was flat, almost lazy. ""I want resources.""  
  
Julian let out a short, sharp laugh. ""You really don't know when to quit, do you?""  
  
Finnian didn't bother turning around. The cigarette flared between his fingers, then dimmed.  
  
""So that's a no,"" he said. ""After all that?""  
  
The calm in his voice made Julian's jaw tighten.  
  
Julian scoffed. ""You think tonight buys you anything?"" His eyes were cold. ""Let me make this clear. If a single word about what happened here gets out, I'll bury your career so deep no one will remember your name.""  
  
'Just a third-tier actor under his own company. Bold enough to crawl into my bed, take everything I gave, and then ask for more. Unbelievable,' he thought.  
  
Julian waited for the blowback. Anger. Defiance. Something.  
  
But nothing came.  
  
Finnian stubbed out the cigarette and stood, completely unfazed. He started getting dressed as if Julian weren't even there.  
  
He bent down, tossed aside the torn shirt without a glance, then picked up Julian's clothes from the floor and slipped into them slowly, deliberately.  
  
Julian watched him, irritation mixing with something far less controlled. He'd spent years surrounded by beautiful people. Faces sculpted for cameras. Bodies trained to perfection.  
  
He should have been immune by now.  
  
But Finnian was different.  
  
The way his shoulders rolled as he moved. The solid strength of his chest. The smooth, controlled lines of muscle, powerful without showing off. And those legs. Long, straight, unapologetically strong.  
  
Julian swallowed, heat stirring again despite himself.  
  
Unfortunately, his body had already hit its limit. One more round and he'd be paying for it for days.  
  
Julian waited for Finnian to push again. To negotiate. To say something sharp, something needy.  
  
Instead, Finnian fastened his belt and turned.  
  
He stepped in close, close enough that Julian could smell smoke and skin. Two fingers tilted Julian's chin up. He pressed a brief kiss to Julian's lips. Then he reached for his phone on the nightstand.  
  
""Alright,"" Finnian said casually. ""I'll get out of your hair.""  
  
And just like that, he turned and walked away. No pause. No look back.  
  
Under the soft glow of the bedside lamp, the check Julian had filled out earlier lay exactly where he'd left it. Untouched.  
  
Julian stared at it. Then at the empty doorway. It took several long seconds to sink in that Finnian was really gone. For a moment, Julian couldn't even tell who had taken advantage of whom.  
  
The frustration hit hard and fast, tight in his chest. With nowhere to put it, he grabbed his phone and dialed his secretary, Lucas Prescott.  
  
""Where are you?"" Julian demanded.  
  
It was four in the morning. Lucas's voice came out groggy and disoriented. ""Mr. Blackwood? I'm—""  
  
Julian cut him off. ""Doesn't matter. Where's Marcus?""  
  
Lucas froze.  
  
Everyone knew Marcus Harrington and Julian went way back. Brothers in everything but blood. Marcus's smooth rise through the industry hadn't happened by accident.  
  
If Julian didn't know where Marcus was, Lucas sure as hell wouldn't.  
  
But with his meal ticket on the line, saying that out loud wasn't an option.  
  
""At this hour,"" Lucas said carefully, ""Marcus should be back on set.""  
  
Julian let out a short, humorless laugh. ""Call him. Tell him I said he can rot there. Stay on that set for the rest of his life if he has to. Don't come back to see me again.""  
  
There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end. ""Right now?""  
  
Julian's voice dropped. ""What, you think I'm joking?""  
  
The line went dead before Lucas could respond. Julian powered off his phone and let it fall onto the bed beside him.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
When Finnian stepped out of Julian's place, the world was still suspended in that fragile hour before dawn. The street looked abandoned, kept alive only by a few streetlights that flickered like they were exhausted by the effort of existing.  
  
He walked without direction, letting his feet decide for him, until the glow of a twenty-four-hour diner pulled him in.  
  
Inside, he ordered a greasy plate of pancakes with bacon and sat on a high stool by the window. He ate slowly, mechanically.  
  
Halfway through, something shifted deep in his chest, a faint pressure. He paused, staring out at the empty street. The memory refused to settle into words. Finnian exhaled, pushed it aside, and lifted another skewer.  
  
Then the static tore through him. The mental barrier he had erected shattered under the sudden surge of noise, electricity screaming through his skull with brutal clarity.  
  
\[Are you out of your fucking mind? Are you trying to get yourself killed?\]  
  
\[I told you to win him over. To get inside his heart. I did not tell you to fuck him the moment you met him!\]  
  
Finnian blinked. 'Right. That.' Earlier, he had muted the Judicator assigned to monitor him. It had seemed unnecessary at the time. An inconvenience.  
  
Now Astrael's voice filled his head, raw with panic and fury. Finnian frowned, more irritated than alarmed. The Judicator was loud, dramatic, and profoundly annoying.  
  
\[He wanted it,\] Finnian said evenly. \[And you told me to take him down.\]  
  
Silence followed. Long. Heavy. The kind that carried the weight of regret.  
  
Astrael had believed itself experienced. Hardened. Capable of handling any mess the heavens threw its way.  
  
And yet, standing knee-deep in this disaster, it could only think that the job was hell, the pay wasn't worth it, and the universe had a sick sense of humor.  
  
Finnian was ancient ice pulled from the deepest abyss, frozen there for ten thousand years.  
  
By the time he took human form, he was already god-adjacent, stationed in the Divine Realm, enforcing divine law with absolute detachment.  
  
So sending him into a human world to erase the soul fragments of fugitives made sense. It was dull, contained, and orderly. The kind of work Finnian was made for.  
  
Then the phoenix Julian got his thread of fate tangled during his trial. Somehow, fixing that mess became Finnian's responsibility.  
  
Worse, the Sovereign decided Julian himself would be part of the solution.  
  
Julian, who was anything but pure, was now supposed to soften Finnian, to teach him empathy, to melt ten thousand years of abyssal ice with warmth  
  
And this cosmic hot potato everyone else dodged landed squarely in Astrael's lap.  
  
By the time it finished the formalities and rushed to initiate protocol, Finnian had already blocked all communication. And Julian was already gone.  
  
When Astrael remained silent for too long, Finnian finally spoke again. \[Did something go wrong with the target?\]  
  
The question was sincere. That was the problem.  
  
He had touched Julian's skin without knowing his fate. Finnian had acted first, as he always did. By instinct. By rule.  
  
Astrael clenched down on its fury. \[Yeah. Something went very wrong.\]  
  
Finnian frowned slightly. \[Then why are you losing your shit?\]  
  
Astrael had no answer.  
  
Instead, it flooded Finnian's mind with Julian's intended life. Every path he was meant to walk. Every love he was meant to survive. Every ending that was never supposed to include Finnian. The information hit hard.  
  
Finnian lifted his milk and drank, calm and steady, as if nothing inside him had shifted at all.  
  
Chapter 2 Crawl Into My Bed  
The Blackwood family did not simply have money. They had history. Decades ago, they built their fortune overseas through businesses that lived in the shadows.  
  
When the domestic market began to boom, they moved fast, pivoting cleanly into entertainment before anyone else caught on.  
  
One after another, they packaged and launched idols who became legends, names known in every household.  
  
Julian's older sister took control of the overseas operations, the part of the empire that still carried stains. What remained, the polished and respectable entertainment company at home, was handed to Julian, the Blackwood family's only heir.  
  
Their father, Elijah Blackwood, was already in failing health, and the decision came early.  
  
Julian was tall and broad-shouldered, all long legs and sharp lines. He treated his body like capital, maintained it with almost obsessive discipline.  
  
When he officially took over the company at twenty-four, female artists swarmed him. Some flirted. Some chased. Some all but threw themselves at his feet.  
  
But none of them ever got anywhere.  
  
Before long, the industry started whispering. People said there was something off about Julian. That maybe his tastes were not what they were supposed to be.  
  
Yet anyone who actually watched him knew one thing for sure. Whether it was the way he spoke, the way he stood, or the way he looked at people, Julian was never going to be the submissive one.  
  
Male artists began testing the waters, inching closer, dropping hints, hoping to be noticed.  
  
The outcomes were brutal. The lucky ones were shelved indefinitely. The rest vanished from the industry without explanation.  
  
In the life fate originally wrote for him, Finnian was straight.  
  
One candid street photo sent him viral overnight. He debuted at the peak most actors never reached, landing the lead role in a television drama adapted from a popular gay romance novel.  
  
Within weeks, his face was everywhere. He was branded the embodiment of the cool, aloof fantasy, the untouchable top-tier presence fans worshipped.  
  
It also trapped him. That image narrowed his future until there was barely any road left to walk.  
  
Then luck turned against him completely. Regulatory crackdowns hit, and the series was quietly pulled from streaming platforms not long after it aired. Just like that, his rise stalled.  
  
After a brief period of silence, Finnian took on a few conventional projects. Straight romances. Safe scripts. None of it landed. Longtime fans felt uneasy watching him paired with women, like the chemistry was fundamentally wrong.  
  
The louder, uglier voices accused him of exploiting queer themes for attention, calling him fake, calculating, disgusting.  
  
Cornered and desperate, Finnian began considering options he never wanted to face. Risky ones.  
  
And right on time, opportunity found him.  
  
Marcus Harrington was a reigning movie star, a box office guarantee. Publicly, he was Julian's closest friend.  
  
Privately, he was the heir to a long-standing vendetta against the Blackwood family. His family had been enemies of the Blackwoods for generations.  
  
He had changed his name, erased his past, and made his way into Julian's inner circle with one goal in mind: revenge.  
  
But Julian had grown up inside the Blackwood family. Suspicion was instinct.  
  
Even when he genuinely treated Marcus like a brother, he never shared the dark secrets of his family. Marcus was never allowed anywhere near the company's inner workings.  
  
And that was when Marcus turned his attention to Finnian.  
  
Marcus offered him a deal: he would help Finnian get close to Julian, clear the path for his career, and once it was over, Marcus would make sure Finnian had enough money to disappear and start fresh somewhere else.  
  
All Marcus wanted in return was evidence of Julian's financial crimes.  
  
A massive empire like the Blackwoods was never built on clean hands.  
  
Finnian agreed.  
  
After a company party, once the crowd had thinned and the alcohol had done its job, Marcus grabbed Finnian by the arm.  
  
Julian was drunk, staggering a little, and Finnian had been hanging around them all night, like a shadow.  
  
""Take him home,"" Marcus had said with a careless shrug. ""Just get him back to his place.""  
  
Julian didn't protest. Finnian didn't leave after they arrived.  
  
He swallowed his disgust and moved in to seduce Julian.  
  
But just as he was about to follow through, Julian stopped him. His voice went sharp, cold, and he ordered Finnian out of his house.  
  
Finnian's stomach sank. He had no patience for Julian's moods. He was about to give up entirely when Julian, unexpectedly, changed his mind. He decided to keep him.  
  
What Finnian never saw coming was the truth behind Julian's so-called ""celibacy."" Julian was, without question, gay. But he was not the dominant force that everyone had assumed.  
  
Finnian had no choice. He did not like men. Every time he was with Julian, it felt like he was slowly suffocating.  
  
Julian, on the other hand, liked Finnian's body, his face. Everything else about him disappointed Julian.  
  
He trained Finnian as one might train a dog: absolute obedience. Anticipate every mood. Perform on command. Even if you don't love me, act like you do.  
  
Julian knew Finnian didn't care for him. He knew Finnian was only there for resources, for leverage, for survival. But Julian didn't care. He wanted compliance. A well-behaved toy.  
  
Finnian shared Julian's bed, but never his trust.  
  
Finnian could endure. Marcus, though, could not.  
  
The tension grew. Marcus saw through the cracks, knew Finnian was unraveling. The man was still straight at his core, and that was eating him alive.  
  
So, Marcus set a trap. He drugged Finnian. While Finnian's mind was clouded, Marcus hired a woman—a sex worker—and sent her to Finnian's bed. Then he tipped off Julian.  
  
When Julian found them together, it all exploded. Rage. Fury. He grabbed Finnian, fists flying, his voice filled with poison.  
  
The woman, egging it on, pushed Julian further. In the chaos, Julian lost control. Finnian's head hit the sharp edge of the coffee table.  
  
He died in an instant. The cameras caught everything. The reporters burst through the door, their lenses flashing, and the scandal detonated.  
  
No matter how powerful the Blackwood family was, no matter how many strings Julian could pull, prison was inevitable.  
  
\[Mission: Cleanse the soul fragments of the fugitive Marcus. Replace the original host, Finnian. Win Julian's genuine heart.\]  
  
Getting tangled in the wrong thread of fate was its own special kind of hell.  
  
It forced a bond where none should exist, binding together people who were never meant to fit, let alone fall in love. This wasn't destiny doing its quiet work. It was a curse, plain and simple.  
  
Finnian thought it was absolute bullshit.  
  
To him, all he had done was refuse a bribe. All he had done was carry out a lawful execution, killing the only son of a decorated hero of the Divine Realm, stripping him of his immortal essence, and casting him back into the mortal world to start over as a human being.  
  
And for that, Finnian was punished, demoted, and thrown into this world to complete a mission so hollow it felt like an insult.  
  
And Finnian had known Julian for a long time. Far too long.  
  
Julian was infamous in the Divine Realm, a first-class bastard with a reputation everyone knew and no one could touch.  
  
He was impossible to control, impossible to corner. He lived right on the edge of divine law, treated it like a game, pushed boundaries until everyone else lost their patience, yet somehow never crossed the one line that would justify taking him down.  
  
Finnian had watched him for years. Shadowed him. Clashed with him more times than he cared to remember.  
  
And still, there was never a clean opening, never a charge that would stick, never a reason solid enough to end it.  
  
It was infuriating.  
  
When Finnian entered this world, he landed directly on the night Julian got drunk out of his mind, the same night the original host walked him home for the first time.  
  
The original Finnian had barely gotten Julian through the door before Astrael ripped his soul away.  
  
The transfer wasn't even finished when Finnian was forced in to take over.  
  
In the chaos, Astrael managed only teo words before disappearing completely. \[Take him.\]  
  
So when Finnian followed Julian into the bedroom, and Julian turned around, drunk and already irritated, asking why he was still there and why he hadn't left yet, Finnian didn't bother softening the blow.  
  
""Marcus sent me,"" he said evenly. ""Said I should get into your bed.""  
  
Julian knew Finnian. Not personally, but enough. There had been a period when Julian quietly followed Finnian's rise, watching his career unfold from a distance with idle interest.  
  
Still, as a boss, Julian had never never crossed paths with him.  
  
Even earlier that night, when Finnian had taken the driver's seat and driven him home, they hadn't exchanged a single word.  
  
Which made it almost impressive that the first sentence Finnian ever said to Julian managed to irritate him and amuse him at the same time.  
  
Julian sat at the foot of the bed, posture loose, gaze slow and deliberate as it traced Finnian's face. Perfect features. Calm, controlled presence. Eyes so intense they felt like they could swallow light.  
  
""So let me get this straight,"" Julian said, lips curling into a lazy grin. ""Marcus tells you to show up, and you just do it. What are you, his damn lapdog?  
  
""Get out.""  
  
Julian had already prepared himself for resistance. For Finnian to cling, to argue, maybe even beg for a chance.  
  
Part of Julian wanted to see it. He wanted to see someone like Finnian brought low, asking for permission.  
  
Everyone knew Julian's bed was untouchable. No one had ever made it there. And if one did, the rewards were the kind people whispered about.  
  
But that wasn't how it went.  
  
Finnian just said, ""Alright,"" turned around, and walked out. He actually left.  
  
And for some reason, that pissed Julian off more than anything else. The smile vanished from Julian's face.  
  
""Get your ass back here,"" he snapped.  
  
Finnian stopped at the doorway and glanced over his shoulder. ""You sure you want that?""  
  
Julian leaned back on his hands, letting the alcohol hum through his veins, eyes sharp and dangerous as they locked onto Finnian.  
  
""Aren't you here to crawl into my bed?"" Julian said, voice low, almost amused. ""Fine. Come on, then. But if you don't do it right, I'll make sure you won't even know how you died.""  
  
Chapter 3 Leave Him Spent In The Sheets  
Julian had always been striking. Deep-set eyes, sharp features, the kind of face that held attention without asking for it. With the alcohol loosening his control, his gaze on Finnian turned unfocused, almost indulgent.  
  
His legs were planted on the floor, posture loose, body radiating a restless hunger, unfulfilled and unapologetic.  
  
Finnian hated that look. He walked back to the bed and stopped right in front of Julian, looming over him.  
  
When he grabbed Julian by the chin and kissed him, it wasn't gentle. It felt confrontational, like he was starting a fight instead of an affair.  
  
Julian had lived clean for twenty-eight years. Disciplined. Restrained. But once that restraint cracked, it shattered fast. The spark caught instantly, fire racing through him before he could stop it.  
  
He reached out and tore Finnian's thin shirt apart in one rough motion.  
  
The fabric ripped under his hands, and the already fragile buttons snapped loose, scattering across the floor in sharp clatters.  
  
To the outside world, Julian was the textbook alpha. He had never hidden his sexuality. What he could never quite say out loud was the fact that he wasn't a top. That truth sat heavy in his chest.  
  
Somewhere in the middle of things with Finnian, his interest faltered. Just briefly. He even thought about telling Finnian to leave, to get out before it went any further.  
  
But Finnian didn't let it drift in the direction Julian expected.  
  
Beneath Finnian's cold, detached exterior was a decisiveness, an assertiveness that caught Julian off guard.  
  
Once it surfaced, it was impossible to ignore. After that, everything followed naturally, one moment slipping into the next, smooth and inevitable.  
  
When Julian finally hit the edge of what he could take, he lost whatever composure he had left. He cursed viciously.  
  
The harder he cursed, the more energized Finnian seemed, like he was determined to push Julian past every limit, intent on leaving him utterly spent in the sheets.  
  
When Astrael reviewed the earlier scene, there were no visuals to process. Only sound. A chaotic mix of shouted insults, raw exchanges, and countless indecent noises, most of them forcibly masked by sharp, repetitive beeps.  
  
Out of Finnian's sight, Astrael held itself together with sheer force of will.  
  
After a long moment, it finally steadied itself and asked through clenched teeth, \[What are you planning to do next?\]  
  
Finnian finished the last of the oden on the table, pulled out a napkin, folded it neatly into a square, and wiped his mouth before answering, \[Go home. Sleep.\]  
  
Then, as if something occurred to him, he took out his phone, which had been set to silent.  
  
Sure enough, the lock screen was filled with missed calls from an unfamiliar number.  
  
The moment he answered, Marcus's voice exploded through the receiver, loud enough to make Finnian wince.  
  
""I told you to take him home,"" he said. ""So where the hell did you actually take him? I've called you a hundred damn times and you didn't pick up once. If you're gonna carry a phone, maybe try using it, huh?""  
  
Marcus had rushed back to the set overnight. He had barely hit the bed and closed his eyes when Julian's secretary had called and tore into him without warning, all fury and zero explanation.  
  
Getting chewed out like that, Marcus could only think of one person who might have set Julian off, and that was Finnian.  
  
Finnian stood up and pushed open the convenience store door as he spoke.  
  
""I took him home. Didn't hear the phone,"" he said.  
  
Marcus didn't sound convinced. ""So what did you do to piss him off?""  
  
Finnian replayed the night in his head, carefully, honestly. ""Nothing. I went along with whatever he wanted.""  
  
Marcus hesitated, then tested the waters. ""Did you… stop halfway? Did he not get enough?""  
  
""No,"" Finnian said flatly.  
  
He hadn't stopped. Julian had told him to stop more than once, but Finnian could feel the state he was in. He was saying one thing and meaning another.  
  
Finnian hadn't pulled back. Details like that didn't seem worth unpacking with Marcus.  
  
Marcus clearly didn't want a blow-by-blow either. He tried again, more cautiously. ""Did he ask for anything… specific? Something you didn't catch, or didn't agree to?""  
  
Finnian raised an eyebrow. ""Like what?""  
  
They were both adults. Some things didn't need to be spelled out. Marcus kept it vague. ""You know. That kind of thing.""  
  
Finnian was an ice block.  
  
He could learn. He could follow instructions and carry out tasks with unsettling precision. He had lived long enough, seen enough of the world to understand how things worked in theory.  
  
But when it came to real experience, actual practice, he was still operating on instinct alone. He knew the rules, yet somehow they had never fully fused with his body.  
  
So when the question came, he only said, ""He didn't ask.""  
  
Marcus knew Julian well enough to read between the lines.  
  
Julian cared deeply about his image. He had standards, expectations even, but he almost never voiced them outright. Pride got in the way. Always had.  
  
The moment Finnian said that, something clicked for Marcus. He sucked in a breath, irritation flashing hot and sharp. ""Jesus Christ. The guy practically shoved the opportunity into your mouth and you still managed to choke on it.  
  
""If he doesn't spell everything out for you, you seriously can't take a hint?  
  
""Finnian, this world is overflowing with people who know exactly how to please Julian. If you still want to make it in this industry, if you want to actually get somewhere, you'd better start putting in the effort yourself.""  
  
He hung up.  
  
A few seconds later, a text popped up: \[Don't say this came from me.\]  
  
Finnian deleted it without hesitation. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, then opened a shopping app and carefully selected several books that looked aggressively professional.  
  
When Astrael saw the titles, it felt a quiet sense of despair settle deep in its core. \[The Thirty Six Strategies of Love\], \[How to Get a Grip on the One You Love\], \[Mastering Emotional Control\], \[How to Drive Them Wild\], \[Three Moves to Make Them Beg for More in Bed\].  
  
'The road ahead is going to be long. Painfully long,' it thought.  
  
Still, if there was one thing to be said for Finnian, it was this: he was willing to learn. And he listened when people spoke. That alone gave Astrael a thin, fragile thread of comfort.  
  
Housing prices in Helningen City were obscene. The body Finnian now occupied came from an unremarkable background.  
  
His parents were factory workers in a small county town. He had only been in the entertainment industry for a year, barely enough time to build any real savings.  
  
The money he made last year went mostly back home, helping his parents upgrade to a modest three bedroom apartment. What little remained went toward a basic car.  
  
Which meant that in Helningen, all he could afford was a rental in a decent location. Convenient transportation, livable surroundings, but old, bland, and painfully unremarkable.  
  
Security was minimal. Cameras everywhere, sure, and two elderly guards taking shifts at the entrance, but that was about it.  
  
Aside from his looks, the original owner of this body had been painfully average.  
  
And like most men living alone, he hadn't escaped chaos.  
  
Clothes were piled on the couch. The wardrobe doors hung open. Socks and underwear sat forgotten in the laundry basket, waiting far too long to be dealt with.  
  
Finnian came home and didn't say a word. He spent the entire day stripping the apartment down, removing everything that served no purpose. Not even a decorative trinket survived.  
  
He went through three full bottles of disinfectant and an entire bag of detergent, washing everything that hadn't been cleaned in ages and hanging it out on the balcony.  
  
Old underwear went straight into the trash. New ones were unpacked, folded into crisp, perfect rectangles, and lined up neatly in storage boxes.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1q8s77o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8s77o,Costa Rica Pastora Black Honey: roasting issues with the SR800,"I’m having issues with over carbonization of some beans with this black honey process. I have experience roasting natural process Ethiopians, and I’ve never had this issue.

When roasting the first batch (photo #1), I was getting smells of second crack when I had just started the first crack. I noticed dark spots on some of the beans, so on the second batch (photo #2), I kept the heat at 1 the entire roast. This delayed first crack to around nine minutes, but it did help reduce the carbonization (I didn’t notice the second crack smells at all).  For both roasts I kept the beans moving vigorously with the airflow. The problem is, as you can see in the second photo, there are still some beans that have dark spots. Peppered throughout are beans that look like the bean in the third picture, but the rest of the beans look fine.

Has anyone experienced this issue when roasting black honey process and what did you do to fix it? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’m hoping I didn’t ruin this batch.",3,1768012544.0,roasting,5,1.0,False

1q8s5jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoOffroad/comments/1q8s5jj/searching_what_is_aim_of_life/,searching what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
